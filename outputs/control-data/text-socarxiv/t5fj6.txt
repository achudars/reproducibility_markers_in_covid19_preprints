Abstract
Museums are located at the intersection of awe and learning: When guests arrive, they are
expecting to be amazed, inspired, and educated. This is particularly true in science museums, and
researchers have pointed to awe as an epistemic emotion that can promote science learning. We
present two studies of awe in a science museum. The first study (n = 293) examined how awe—
conceptualized as a multifaceted construct associated with positive feelings of
liberation/connection, negative feelings of oppression/isolation, chills, and diminished-self
perceptions—differed across museum locations and in relation to prior knowledge. The second
study (n = 708) expanded the investigation to also examine the relationship between awe and
critical thinking. Across both studies, we found that, relative to baseline spaces, vast, beautiful
spaces elicited positive awe-related emotions (amazement, curiosity) and stronger awe correlates
(chills, diminished-self perceptions); vast, threatening spaces also elicited stronger amazement,
chills, and diminished-self perceptions—but also stronger oppression/isolation. In both studies,
pre-visit knowledge was associated with awe experiences during the visit. In Study 2, we also
found evidence for relationships between awe and skepticism and aesthetic thought, two aspects
of critical thinking: Positive aspects of awe (liberation/connection, curiosity) were associated
with more skepticism, and negative aspects of awe (oppression/isolation, disorientation) with
less skepticism. In terms of aesthetic thinking, diminished-self perceptions were associated being
able describe observed roles and actions, and chills were associated with being able to describe
personal opinions. These results support the assertion that awe can be used to encourage
engagement and learning in informal science settings.

Awe and Epistemology in a Science Museum
As a feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder (Oxford English Dictionary,
n.d.), awe has been proposed as a catalyst for science learning (Valdesolo, Shtulman, & Baron,
2017). Indeed, in one of his last public talks, which he titled Wonder and Skepticism, Carl Sagan
described the moment when, as a child, he considered the distance to the stars: “The dazzling
idea of a universe vast beyond imagining swept over me. It has stayed with me ever since. I
sensed awe” (Sagan, 1995). Ann Druyan, his writing partner and an independently established
expert in science education, believes that awe and wonder are key to skepticism and belief in
science (Grothe, 2006).
A natural and accessible place to experience awe is in museums, which are often
designed explicitly to induce awe and similar emotions in their guests. For example, museum
architects often use the compression and expansion effect to induce awe by forcing guests to
walk down narrow corridors before being presented into a large, immersive open space. Guests
come to museums “with expectations to see wondrous things that they cannot see in their
everyday lives” (Smith, 2014) and they come ready to learn and are generally in a receptive state
of mind. This combination of feeling awe while also being open to learning is an ideal
environment for education. The aim of this research project was to explore whether designed
museum spaces differ in their capacity to evoke awe and in the nature of awe that they do evoke,
and to test the hypothesis that the extent to which museum spaces evoke awe influences guests’
skeptical and aesthetic thinking.
Awe and Science Learning
In the most comprehensive theoretical analysis of awe to date, Keltner and Haidt (2003)
identified two key features of stimuli that are likely to elicit the emotion of awe: perceived
vastness and need for accommodation. Vast stimuli challenge the individual’s understanding of

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

the world—not only by virtue of sheer physical size (e.g., the Grand Canyon), but also in terms
of sensory detail (e.g., a complex work of art), social or historical importance (e.g., an event that
affects thousands of people), explanatory power and conceptual breadth (e.g., a complex theory),
or even just volume of unexpected information (Shiota, Thrash, Danvers, & Dombrowski, 2014).
These challenges to understanding require cognitive accommodation—updating our worldview
to establish meaning—and motivate us to learn. Awe is the emotion we experience in response to
our recognition that something is so great that it defies what we can currently understand—that
feeling of reverence, tinged with wonder and/or fear.
Stated differently, awe is an epistemic emotion (Silvia, 2008; Valdesolo, Park, &
Gottlieb, 2016), evoked by knowledge tasks and knowledge-generating activities (Trevors, Muis,
Pekrun, Sinatra, & Winne, 2016). Epistemic emotions and related affect can instigate and
stabilize learning in science (Jaber & Hammer, 2016a; Jaber & Hammer, 2016b), and include not
only awe, but also emotions such as interest, curiosity, confusion, and surprise. They often
operate in tandem. Awe, for example, might be accompanied by confusion and surprise to the
extent that events that evoke awe are those that cannot be comprehended fully within preexisting knowledge schemas. Moreover, these events can create uncertainty that often leads to
curiosity and interest. Such feelings of uncertainty have been identified as particularly important
for education around controversial scientific topics, such as evolution (Ha, Haury, & Nehm,
2012) and climate change (Lombardi & Sinatra, 2012).
Awe’s status as an epistemic emotion has been supported by several independent lines of
research. Most recently, awe has been shown to promote awareness of knowledge gaps and
science interest (McPhetres, 2019): Participants who were induced to experience nature-related
awe via video clips or virtual reality, relative to baseline participants, were more likely to

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

5

endorse statements such as “I ask myself if I really understand how the natural world works,” to
report that they found science magazines interesting, and to choose a ticket to a science museum
over an art museum.
However, it is not merely the case that awe provokes awareness and interest. Empirical
evidence also suggests that awe has implications for the kinds of thinking that are conducive to
science learning. Danvers and Shiota (2017), for example, experimentally induced awe and
compared it to either a general positive emotion state or a neutral emotion state. Participants
induced to feel awe, relative to other participants, relied less on preexisting knowledge, inserting
fewer “false” but schema-consistent details into memory recollections. These findings suggest
that awe helps individuals limit their use of the schema-driven expectations that they would
normally use to understand the world. In the context of science learning, awe may support
individuals’ ability to challenge their naive beliefs (e.g., about how gravity operates, the causes
of climate change; cf. Valdesolo et al., 2017).
There is also evidence that awe induces “better” thinking. For example, awe has been
shown to promote ethical decision making (Piff, Dietze, Feinberg, Stancato, & Keltner, 2015).
Some empirical evidence also supports the role of awe in promoting critical thinking. In one
study, participants who were cued to remember memories of awe were less likely than
participants in a control condition to be persuaded by weak arguments subsequently presented to
them, that is they were more critical in their thought (Griskevicius, Shiota, & Neufeld, 2010).
Other research has demonstrated that the self-reported tendency to feel awe is associated with
less discomfort with uncertainty (Shiota et al., 2007) and greater understanding of more nuanced
aspects of science and being more resistant to weak scientific arguments (Gottlieb, Keltner &
Lombrozo, 2018). Awe, in making individuals aware of the limitations of their knowledge and

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

stimulating their interest in gaining more knowledge, is associated with more careful evaluation
of the evidentiary value of information.
Theoretical Framework
Vygotsky considered emotion as an inseparable part of the basis of cognition and thought
(Vygotsky, 1926, 1997; Mahn & John-Steiner, 2002; Roth & Lee, 2007). Emotions are
considered an important aspect of conceptual change in science learning (Zembylas, 2005;
Treagust & Duit, 2008). Emotions have also been shown to enhance science achievement by
encouraging cognitive engagement (Sinatra, Broughton & Lombardi, 2014; RappoltSchlictmann, Evans, Reich & Cahill, 2017), motivation (Pintrinch, 2003; Coleman, 2014) and
long-term science learning (King, Ritchie, Sandhu & Henderson, 2015) perhaps through causing
physiological and hormonal responses that help encode memories (Cahill, 2000). But emotions
are complex and need to be studied in a manner integrated with the learning context in which
they are experienced (Hascher, 2010).
Like others, we propose that awe might be a particularly potent catalyst for learning—and
for science learning, in particular (Coleman, 2014; Valdesolo, et al., 2017). Expectancy
violations have been shown to stimulate learning in both children and adults (Lorini &
Castelfranchi, 2007; Stahl & Feigenson, 2015), and awe translates expectancy violations and
knowledge gaps into scientific interest (McPhetres, 2019), thus motivating learning. Awe can
also lead to questions about whether new or prior knowledge is accurate—driving skepticism, a
key component of critical thinking (Lai, 2011). In short, through expectancy violation,
knowledge gap awareness, surprise and disequilibration, feelings of awe can prompt a learner to
both question prior knowledge schemas and to be more open to (but also critical of) new ideas or
information.

In suggesting that awe enables people to “let go” of their prior knowledge, we are not
suggesting that prior knowledge is irrelevant to the awe experience. In fact, prior knowledge is
critical to experiencing awe. Awe is assumed to arise when current experience cannot be
accommodated within existing knowledge. Individuals experience awe when they are confronted
with an unexpected event (unexpected in that it is either entirely novel or highly inconsistent
with experience) and when the resulting knowledge gap can only be reduced through cognitive
accommodation. To the extent that individuals have strong schemas, they should better able
detect knowledge gaps. As such, prior knowledge should promote the experience of awe.
The museum-based link between awe and learning may occur through aesthetic thinking.
In addition to creating feelings of awe, museums are a well-known source for teaching and
supporting aesthetic thought processes (Lankford, 2002; Smith & Smith, 2006), which can be a
source of growth in critical thinking skills (Housen, 2002, 2007; Hubard, 2011; Kokkos, 2013).
Thus, we posit that, in museums, awe is a mediator of various aspects of critical thinking such as
the use of prior knowledge, skeptical thinking and aesthetic thought.
Research Context
Emotions in general have long been linked to cognitive outcomes (Pekrun & Schutz,
2007; Rienties, & Rivers, 2014) and their impacts on learning are well studied in academia
(Linnenbrink-Garcia & Pekrun, 2011). However, very few are studying emotions and cognition
outside of the classroom—despite the fact that much of lifelong learning occurs in such informal
learning environments and activities (Falk & Dierking, 2010). Informal learning settings can be
an ideal environment for studying emotions in learning due to its flexibility to draw emotions
from across the scale from micro to macro (Sinatra, Heddy & Lombardi, 2015). Most existing

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

studies of awe are based on laboratory and/or experimentally induced conditions, usually through
the use of video, photographs or recalled memories, which limits the generality of the results.
Museums offer a rare opportunity to measure the impact of naturalistic awe. In epistemic
emotion research in general, researchers have noted the differences between emotions induced
experimentally or occurring naturally, suggesting they might lead to differing outcomes (Trevors
et al., 2016; Makin, 2017). In museums, guests are presented with awe-inspiring stimuli as part
of the very design of the experience. This stimuli goes beyond what can be offered in most
laboratory environments since it involves the entire physical space, content that comes before
and after the experience, and also the social aspects of awe (e.g., feeling awe by seeing
something through the eyes of a child). In museums and other informal learning environments,
emotions such as arousal and enjoyment have been linked to greater long-term learning in
science (Falk & Gillespie, 2009; Author, , 2015), conservation (Ballantyne, Packer, Hughes &
Dierking, 2007), history (Sakr, Jewitt, & Price, 2016) and aesthetic contexts (Greene, 2014).
Museums are a natural place to study naturalistic awe and test current theories about awe and
emotions in learning.
The main context for this study is a large, urban science museum in the United States.
Constructed in 1891, the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago (hereafter, MSI–Chicago)
was originally built to house fine art during the 1893 Columbian Exposition and World’s Fair.
Designed in a Beaux-Arts style, it is situated in a large park surrounded by lakes and grassy
fields. The Museum has two public entrances. One is on the surface and behind a grassy knoll.
The other is in an underground parking garage. Both entrances lead to a cavernous main hall.
Once guests have tickets, they usually leave the main hall and enter via a stairway leading up to a
main rotunda. The rotunda is a large, domed area with exhibit galleries on three sides. Designed

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

to create an awe-inspiring moment, guests can view a 727 aircraft hanging from a ceiling in one
direction, and in the opposite direction, a 40-foot tornado vortex spinning with a ceiling-mounted
tesla coil firing behind it. Another awe-inspiring moment used in this study is the reveal of the
U-505 Unterseeboot, or U-boat (submarine). Guests enter the U-boat gallery after walking down
a dark, sinking, narrow pathway (symbolically representing a submerging submarine) describing
events leading up to the real life capture of the U-boat in 1944. The dark pathway opens up into a
large gallery with the bow of the boat directly in front at eye level. Guests then walk down a
ramp along the length of the submarine into a space presenting interactive exhibits.
The Present Studies
We present two studies of awe within a science museum context. The first study
examined how awe differed across locations within a museum and its relationship with prior
knowledge. The second study expanded the investigation to also examine the relationship
between awe and skeptical and aesthetic thinking. Our first hypothesis was that awe would differ
across within the museum and would be higher within specifically targeted exhibits than
compared to a baseline condition. Our second hypothesis was that greater levels of awe would be
positively related to higher scores on our skeptical and aesthetic thinking tasks. We used similar
instruments in both studies as an additional check of reliability. We also placed special emphasis
on the impact of negative associations with awe, something understudied in the literature.
Study 1
In Study 1, we sampled three locations in the MSI–Chicago to see if there is evidence of
awe in the museum and whether it changed based on location design. To measure positively
valenced awe, we chose the museum’s rotunda. For negatively valenced awe, we chose the U-505
exhibit. Both target locations were expected to manifest the known elicitors of awe (Keltner &

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

Haidt, 2003; Shiota, Keltner, & Mossman, 2007): physical vastness in both cases, but also aesthetic
beauty in the case of the rotunda and historical significance in the case of the U-505. Our baseline
location was a parking garage, which allowed us to collect data from museum guests before they
entered the museum and interacted with any exhibits and we assumed would show low levels of
positive and negative awe. We expected the target locations to elicit greater awe than the baseline
locations. We were also interested in whether the nature of the awe experience would differ across
locations.
In addition, we explored the role of prior knowledge in how one experiences awe.
Knowledge can help individuals understand the complexity of their experience (Caranfa, 2003;
Ecklund & Long, 2011; Krause & Hayward, 2015). In addition, background knowledge scaffolds
the experience in such a way that individuals are able to recognize more precisely what they do
not know—to locate and identify gaps in their knowledge. Prior knowledge can also help one
appreciate how rare a particular experience can be. Awe arises in response to perceiving vastness
and being motivated to make sense of the experience (Keltner & Haidt, 2003). To the extent that
knowledge can facilitate the comprehension of vastness and the recognition of a need for sensemaking, it should heighten the awe experience.
Method
Participants. Participants were 288 museum guests recruited from the museum floor (n =
182) and parking garage (n = 106). Participant demographics are presented in Table 1 for both
Studies 1 and 2. As a matter of policy, as of 2017, the Museum no longer asks race/ethnicity
questions unless it is fundamental to the research question. However, a separate 2018 internal
study established that this museum’s guest population self-identifies as 64% White, 12% Latinx,
12% Asian and Asian ethnicities, 8% Black or African American, 1% American Indian or

Procedure. Materials were mostly administered via tablet devices, though occasionally
paper surveys were used for accessibility reasons. Museum guests were approached in three
separate locations within MSI: the parking garage, the rotunda, or the U-505 exhibit. For the
garage, guests were recruited as as they approached the museum’s doors after walking through
the garage. At the rotunda, guests were approached as they were exiting the rotunda to enter

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

12

another exhibit. An attempt was made to target guests who had just entered the rotunda for the
first time, by looking for guests who arrived via an escalator from the main hall and who paused
to get their bearings upon entering the space. U-505 guests were recruited after they had walked
down a pathway that curved around the submarine. Participants completed the survey
unsupervised and at their own pace. Participation in the research study was voluntary; however,
they were offered free admission or a small science-themed gift (~$3 value) as an incentive. The
survey was mostly distributed via tablet devices, except for a handful of guests who filled out a
written survey for accessibility reasons. Following the completion of all tasks, participants were
debriefed and compensated accordingly.
Awe-related emotions. Participants rated the extent to which they experienced each of
nine awe-related emotions (awe, confusion, amazement, disorientation, wonder, fascination,
astonishment, curiosity, and bewilderment) while walking through the target location (garage,
rotunda, U-505), along a scale anchored from 0 (not at all) to 6 (very much); item order was
randomized.
Momentary awe. Participants completed an 18-item Situational Awe Scale (SAS; Author,
Author, Author, Author, & Author, under revision). Reflecting the need to recognize and study
the full complexity of an emotion (Pekrun et al., 2007), the SAS was designed to measure all
aspects of awe, including some of its negative connotations. Its items reflect four facets of awe:
liberation/connection (e.g., “I felt psychologically connected to everyone/everything around
me”), oppression/isolation (e.g., “Everything seemed disjointed”), chills (e.g., “I felt chills), and
diminished sense of self (e.g., “I felt like I was trivial in the grand scheme of things”).
Participants rated the extent to which they disagreed versus agreed with each statement as it

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

13

applied to how they felt while walking through the target location, along a 7-point scale anchored
by -3 (disagree strongly) and +3 (agree strongly); item order was randomized.
Dispositional awe. Participants completed the awe subscale of the Dispositional Positive
Emotion Scale (DPES-awe; Shiota, Keltner, & John et al., 2006)They rated the extent to which
they disagreed versus agreed with six items such as “I often feel awe” and “I feel wonder almost
every day” as they applied to “normal daily life.” Ratings were made along a 7-point scale
anchored by -3 (disagree strongly) and +3 (agree strongly); item order was randomized.
Prior knowledge and learning enjoyment. Participants in the rotunda and the U-505
exhibit (but not the parking garage) responded to several items designed to reflect cognitive
versus affective aspects of engagement. Specifically, they responded to two items assessing their
self-perceived knowledge about location-relevant topics: “To what extent do you consider
yourself knowledgeable about art [architecture]?” in the rotunda, and “To what extent do you
consider yourself knowledgeable about military history [military technology]?” in the U-505
exhibit. They also responded to two items assessing their self-reported enjoyment of learning
about location-relevant topics: “To what extent do you enjoy learning about art [architecture]?”
in the rotunda and “To what extent do you enjoy learning about military history [military
technology]?” in the U-505 exhibit. All ratings were made along 7-point scales anchored by 0
(not at all) and 6 (very much).1

A critical thinking task was also included. Participants responded to the yes/no question, “Do
you believe climate change is real and human activity is partially responsible for it?”. They were
then asked to provide evidence for their answer, which was intended to be coded as “strong”
versus “weak” depending on whether the evidence reflected elaborated scientific knowledge
versus non-elaborated reasons that did no more than reiterate subjective evaluations and
emotions. Analysis was to reflect that one aspect of critical thinking is the ability to distinguish
between strong and weak arguments (Griskevicius, Shiota, & Neufeld, 2010). Unfortunately, so
few participants provided valid responses (most responses were too short or provided no

Demographic information. Participants reported their age and gender. They were also
asked whether they had visited any other museums, zoos, or aquariums in the previous seven
days, and to indicate on a checklist any other MSI exhibits they had visited that day prior to
completing the survey.
Results
Scale descriptives for both studies are presented in Table 2. Inter-scale correlations and
descriptive statistics for awe-related emotions and momentary awe as a function of target
location are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, these latter
scores were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) as a function of target location
(garage, rotunda, U-505). Statistically significant main effects were probed with Bonferronicorrected t-tests. Note that missing/partial data were treated using listwise deletion procedures,
resulting in small differences in sample sizes (and thus degrees of freedom) across analyses.
Do awe-related emotions vary as a function of context? To measure relatedness
between items, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis on participants’ awe-related emotion
ratings, using oblimin rotation and maximum likelihood estimation for data extraction. The
analysis yielded three factors, although one of the factors included items that loaded more
strongly and more thematically onto another factor. We thus chose to calculate two factors,
which we labelled according to the strongest contributing item: amazement (amazement, awe,
astonishment, curiosity, fascination, wonder, and, surprisingly, bewilderment; Cronbach’s α =
.902, inter-item r = .26–.76) and disorientation (confusion, disorientation; Cronbach’s α = .78, r
= .65).

evidence) to the open-ended reason question that we were unable to reliably code and analyze
the data. Those raw answers are available upon request.

A MANOVA on awe-related emotion scores as a function of target location revealed a
reliable multivariate main effect of location, F(4, 568) = 10.63, p < .001, η2p = .070. At the
univariate level, amazement differed reliably as a function of location, F(2, 284) = 16.46, p <
.001, η2p = .104, as did disorientation, F(2, 284) = 3.61, p = .028. However, participants in the
rotunda and the U-505 exhibit both reported higher amazement relative to participants in the
parking garage, both p < .001; amazement did not differ between the rotunda and the U-505
exhibit, p = 1. In terms of disorientation, the only reliable effect was that participants in the U505 exhibit reported less disorientation than participants in the parking garage, p = .037, all other
p ≥ .11.
Does momentary awe vary as a function of context? A confirmatory factor analysis of
the four facets of awe determined by Author et al. (under revision) yielded only marginal support
for the original structural model (CFI = .893, RMSEA = .072), but a follow-up exploratory factor
analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and oblimin rotation suggested that items loaded
as predicted for three of the four factors (the exception being the diminished-self factor2). Thus,
we elected to calculate the subscale scores as originally suggested: liberation/connection
(Cronbach’s α = .83, inter-item r = .36–.57); oppression/isolation (Cronbach’s α = .81, inter-item
r = .398–.55), chills (Cronbach’s α = .85, inter-item r = .49–.68), and diminished self
(Cronbach’s α = .51, inter-item r = .22–.31).

We elected to keep the diminished-self factor because it remains theoretically interesting but its
reliability might be compromised by the fact that it contains only three items.

Awe-Related Emotions

Momentary Awe

Note. Possible range = 0 to 6 for awe-related emotions; -3 to +3 for momentary awe.

A MANOVA on momentary awe scores as a function of target location yielded a
significant effect of location, F(8, 566) = 8.65, p < .001, η2p = .109. At the univariate level, this
effect was not reliable for liberation/connection, F(2, 285) = 0.34, p = .72, η2p = .002. In
contrast, all three remaining facets yielded reliable univariate effects: oppression/isolation, F(2,
285) = 5.89, p = .003, η2p = .040; chills, F(2, 285) = 12.19, p < .001, η2p = .079; diminished self,
F(2, 285) = 10.204, p < .001, η2p = .067. Participants in the rotunda and the U-505 exhibit
reported stronger chills and diminished-self perceptions than did participants in the parking
garage, all p ≤ .002; reported chills and diminished-self perceptions did not differ between the
rotunda and U-505 exhibit, both p = 1. Participants in the U-505 exhibited also reported more
oppression/isolation than did participants in the rotunda, p = .004; participants in the parking

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

18

garage reported intermediate levels of oppression/isolation that did not differ from either target
location, p ≥ .043.
How does dispositional awe relate to momentary awe experience? Dispositional awe
scores were calculated by averaging across the six DPES-awe items (Cronbach’s α = .78, interitem r = .19–.500). As Table 3 indicates, dispositional awe was associated with all positive
variants and facets of awe: To the extent that participants reported a stronger tendency to
experience awe, they also reported higher levels of liberation/connection, stronger chills,
stronger diminished-self perceptions, and stronger amazement.
How do prior knowledge and learning enjoyment relate to momentary awe
experience? We averaged across participants’ ratings separately for knowledge items
(Cronbach’s α = .79, r = .65) and learning enjoyment items (Cronbach’s α = .82, r = .698). As
indicated in Table 3, prior learning enjoyment correlated positively with amazement. In addition,
the analysis revealed positive associations between both prior knowledge and learning
enjoyment, and two facets of awe: To the extent that participants reported more prior knowledge
and learning enjoyment, they also reported higher levels of liberation/connection and stronger
chills.
We used a linear regression model to predict the effect of prior knowledge and learning
enjoyment on momentary awe. Feelings of liberation/connection were predicted by both prior
knowledge (β = 0.151, SE = .066, p = .022) and prior learning enjoyment (β = 0.145, SE = .067,
p = .031), and that chills were predicted by prior knowledge (β = 0.33, SE = .088, p < .001) but
not learning enjoyment (β = -.040, SE = .089, p = .66).
Discussion

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

19

The goal of Study 1 was to confirm whether we could reliably measure different levels of
awe in science museum guests as a function of the location in which they reflected on their
experience. For positive awe, we chose a location (the rotunda) that was vast, beautiful and
hopeful. For negative awe, we chose another location (the U-505 exhibit) that was also vast, but
associated with negative topics (war) and designed to give a sense of the extreme, claustrophobic
lifestyle sailors experienced while on board. Indeed, we demonstrated that the positive-awe
location, relative to baseline, evoked stronger feelings of amazement, stronger chills, and a
diminished sense of self. The negative-awe location evoked the same reactions, as well as
stronger feelings of oppression/isolation.
We also conducted a preliminary exploration of the relationship between prior knowledge
of and learning enjoyment related to location-relevant topics. If awe is indeed an epistemic or
knowledge emotion, then it should be related to how much individuals engage with the relevant
information. Indeed, we found that self-reported pre-visit knowledge of location-relevant topics
(art and architecture in the rotunda, or military history and technology in the U-505 exhibit) were
associated with stronger feelings of liberation/connection and chills. Pre-visit enjoyment of
learning about location-relevant topics was also associated with stronger liberation/connection
and chills, but also with greater amazement. This was an unexpected result. Awe is often
associated with elements of surprise and violations of expectation (Valdesolo, et al. 2017), yet
we find that prior knowledge actually increased awe—perhaps due to a better ability to
appreciate what they were experiencing.
The similarities and differences in experienced awe in the rotunda and U-505 exhibit
highlight the importance of examining both positive and negative variants of awe: Although only
the U-505 elicited stronger feelings of oppression/isolation relative to baseline, both the U-505

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

20

and the rotunda elicited stronger chills and diminished-self perceptions. This pattern is
informative regarding the nature of awe: Although we might colloquially think of awe as a
positive emotion, it can nonetheless include a negative component.
In sum, Study 1 confirmed that we could reliably differentiate awe experiences as a
function of exhibit space. It also provided some preliminary insight into the role of engagement
in the awe experience. The results suggested that the cognitive aspect of engagement—prior
knowledge—was associated most strongly with experiencing chills; the affective aspect of
engagement—prior learning enjoyment—was associated most strongly with feelings of
liberation/connection. In focusing on prior knowledge and learning enjoyment, however, our
results speak more to whether engagement predicts awe,3 rather than on the question of whether
awe increases elements of critical thinking; we sought to address the latter in Study 2.
Study 2
In Study 2, we investigated awe as a predictor of skeptical and aesthetic thinking—two
aspects of critical thinking. For a subset of participants, we assessed self-reported skepticism,
operationalized in terms of an enjoyment of learning, a preference for considered and unhurried
judgment, and a reliance on one’s own judgment. For a different subset of participants, we
analyzed critical thinking, operationalized in terms of their responses to a set of visual stimuli.
We sought to demonstrate that momentary awe would be associated with a greater self-reported
preference for critical thinking, and deeper analyses of visual stimuli that reflected greater
engagement with the stimuli.

Of course, our correlational design does not allow us to make strong inferences about causality,
and retrospective reports might be biased by ongoing experience.

Our critical thinking measure was based on the Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS)
framework, which is informed by the stages of aesthetic development theory (DeSantis &
Housen, 2000). This framework supports evidentiary reasoning by encouraging learners to
“observe carefully, evaluate, synthesize, justify and speculate” (Housen, 2002, p.101). The VTS
framework applies aspects of Piaget’s stages of cognitive development and Vygotsky’s zone of
proximal development to describe the growth of aesthetic appreciation and cognition, which
occurs across five distinct stages of thinking (Housen, 2007). We focused on two of those stages
that the majority of museum guests are likely to experience. The first, Accountive, describes
individuals making simple, concrete, and sometimes egocentric observations of art work and
exhibits that may be used to tell narratives. In the second stage, Constructive, individuals begin
to build a framework of what they see using their perception, knowledge, and values (Yenawine,
1999; Housen, 2002, 2007).
VTS was first designed as a curriculum to help art educators develop aesthetic
understanding in their students and the art viewing public (Housen, 2002). Its core activity
entails exposing students to visual art work and posing a series of open-ended questions: “What
is going on here?”, “What do you see that makes you say that?”, and “What more can you find?”
(Housen, 2002; Yenawine, 1999). VTS is very commonly used in the art education field.
However, its use has now grown into non-art disciplines. Recently, it has been applied to science
education contexts to promote observation and communication skills (Wellbery & McAteer,
2015, Yenawine, 2013), interdisciplinary health learning programs (Klugman & BeckmannMendez, 2015), pharmacy programs (Ryan, 2013), and nursing programs (Reilly, Ring & Duke,
2005). It has been used to teach critical thinking skills to dental and medical school students
(Curtin & McConnell, 2017; Anderson, 2018) and to measure the development of scientific

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

22

thinking skills in children (Foss, 2014). VTS is currently being adapted as a curriculum
framework for science museums and classrooms (IMLS, 2016).
As an assessment framework, VTS analyses have been primarily focused on the content
of interviews conducted with students using the previous three VTS questions as prompts. VTS
has also more recently been administered within constructed response writing tasks (Curva et al.,
2005, DeSantis 2007, DeSantis 2009, Egan & Grobe 2014; Foss, 2014; Greene, Kisida, &
Bowen, 2014). Responses are typically analyzed for associations between elements that students
saw in the art or objects being observed and/or the quality of the direct evidence they linked to
their observations. These associations have been shown to reflect critical thinking skills such as
making critical observations, interpreting identity and context of a scene, comparing elements in
an image, thinking flexibly about meaning and identifying problems (Adams, Foutz, Luke, &
Stein, 2006;). Additionally, standardized test scores have been used to measure a VTS-based
curriculum’s impact on students’ general academic achievement (Adams, et al., 2006; Curva et
al., 2005).
In Study 2, we sampled four locations at the museum. We approached guests not only in
the parking garage and rotunda as in Study 1, but also at a separate entrance, located in the
ground floor entrance kiosk and in the main hall as they were leaving. The entrance kiosk is
situated in a park setting area surrounded by a large grassy knoll, playgrounds, bus/car drop off
ribbon and the shore of Lake Michigan. It is the main entrance venue for guests who arrive via
mass transit, bicycle and walking, taxi and ride sharing services (about 50%). It was chosen to
measure any impact the Museum’s architecture itself may have on awe and provide another
baseline to represent guests’ experience. The main hall is where tickets are purchased and was
chosen to provide a second location that should evoke positive awe (with its vastness and a high,

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

23

arched ceiling); we also wanted to provide an end-of-day measure, to provide preliminary data
on whether awe diminishes with exposure.
Method
Participants. Participants were 708 museum guests, recruited and compensated as in
Study 1. Participant demographics are presented in Table 1. This study was approved by the
museum’s Institutional Review Board.
Procedure. Procedures were as in Study 1 unless otherwise noted. Museum guests were
approached in four separate locations: in the parking garage or at the ground floor entrance kiosk
before they entered the museum, on their way out of the rotunda to enter an exhibit, or in the
main hall as they were leaving the museum.
Data collection was conducted in several waves, with participants in all waves first
completing the awe-related emotion and momentary awe measures as in Study 1. Participants in
one wave of data collection (n = 456) then completed a critical thinking pilot4 and a skepticism
measure prior to completing the art-/architecture-oriented prior knowledge and enjoyment
measure; participants in the other wave of data collection (n = 188) completed the art/architecture-oriented prior knowledge and enjoyment measure from Study 1, followed by the
aesthetic thinking measure.5 The remaining participants (n = 64) completed only the awe-related
emotions, momentary awe, and prior knowledge and enjoyment measures. Finally, all
participants provided demographic information.

We do not report the pilot for this paper because the instrument did not pass a number of
psychometric validation tests. Participants were asked to rate the strength of a set of arguments in
favor of light pollution as a topic of societal and scientific importance.
5
Due to a programming error, a subset of participants in the second wave of data collection
(those approached in the parking garage or at the entrance kiosk) received only three of the four
prior knowledge and learning enjoyment items; the item assessing learning enjoyment related to
architecture was mistakenly omitted.

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

24

Skepticism. The Professional Skepticism Scale (PSS; Hurtt, 2010) contains 30 items that
cover six components of skepticism. We included 20 items comprising four of the factors: search
for knowledge (e.g., “I think that learning is exciting”); suspension of judgment (e.g., “I take my
time when making decisions”); self-determination (e.g., “I tend to immediately accept what other
people tell me”; reverse-coded); and questioning mind (e.g., “I frequently question things that I
see or hear”). Ratings were made along a 7-point scale anchored by -3 (disagree strongly) and +3
(agree strongly); item order was randomized.
Visual thinking. Each participant was shown two of three science-themed images (see
Figure 1), chosen randomly. Beneath each image were the three VTS prompts: “What is going
on here? (Try to write at least 50 words)”, followed by “What do you see that makes you think
that? (Try to write at least 25 words)”, and then “What else is going on here? (Try to write at
least 50 words)”. Word length suggestions were added after pilot testing revealed brevity in
initial guest responses.

Scale descriptives are presented in Table 2. Inter-scale correlations and descriptive
statistics for awe-related emotions and momentary awe as a function of target location are
presented in Tables 5–6, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, these latter scores were
analyzed using ANOVA as a function of target location (garage, entrance kiosk, main hall–
arriving, rotunda, main hall–leaving). Statistically significant main effects were probed with
Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. As in Study 1, missing/partial data were treated using listwise
deletion procedures, resulting in small differences in sample sizes (and thus degrees of freedom)
across analyses.
Do awe-related emotions vary as a function of context? As in Study 1, to reduce the
effect of inter-item correlations, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis on participants’
awe-related emotion ratings, using oblimin rotation and maximum likelihood estimation for data
extraction. The analysis yielded three factors, which we again labelled according to the strongest
contributing item: amazement (amazement, astonishment, awe; Cronbach’s α = .89, inter-item r
= .602–.75), disorientation (confusion, disorientation; Cronbach’s α = .75, r = .595), and
curiosity (curiosity, fascination; Cronbach’s α = .79, r = .66). Two items (wonder, bewilderment)
each loaded onto two factors with similar factor loadings; inspection of the fit of these items with
the separate factors yielded no clear decisions as to where they belonged, so we elected to omit
them from the analysis.

Momentary Awe

Note. Possible range = 0 to 6 for awe-related emotions; -3 to +3 for momentary awe.

A multivariate ANOVA on awe-related emotion scores as a function of target location
yielded a significant effect of location, F(12, 2094) = 13.55, p < .001, η2p = .072. At the
univariate level, three scores yielded reliable univariate effects: amazement, F(4, 698) = 35.14, p
< .001, η2p = .168; disorientation, F(4, 698) = 9.23, p < .001, ηp2 = .050; curiosity, F(4, 698) =
14.49, p < .001, η2p = .077. Participants in the rotunda and leaving the main hall reported more
amazement and curiosity than did participants in the parking garage or at the entrance kiosk, all p
< .001. Participants in the main hall prior to leaving the museum also reported more amazement

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

28

than did participant in the main hall entering the museum, p = .010. Participants in the rotunda
also reported more disorientation than did participants in all other locations, all p ≤ .009. This is
perhaps because they were overwhelmed by the large number of exhibit options displayed before
them combined by the design of the heavy-sensory load, multi-level space.
Does momentary awe vary as a function of context? As in Study 1, a confirmatory
factor analysis of the four facets of awe determined by Author et al. (under revision) yielded only
marginal support for the original structural model (CFI = .87, RMSEA = .0787), but a follow-up
exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and oblimin rotation again
suggested that items generally loaded as predicted on the four factors. Two items (free, breath
taken) each loaded onto two factors (liberation/connection and oppression/isolation, and chills
and diminished-self, respectively), but the stronger factor loadings were on the appropriate
subscales. Thus, we elected to calculate the subscale scores as originally suggested:
liberation/connection (Cronbach’s α = .79, inter-item r = .26–.66); oppression/isolation
(Cronbach’s α = .83, inter-item r = .41–.57), chills (Cronbach’s α = .84, inter-item r = .46–.71),
and diminished self (Cronbach’s α = .54, inter-item r = .27–.31).
A multivariate ANOVA on momentary awe scores as a function of target location yielded
a significant effect of location, F(16, 2796) = 11.11, p < .001, η2p = .060. At the univariate level,
this effect was reliable for liberation/connection, F(4, 699) = 2.52, p = .040, η2p = .014, although
the only significant effect was that participants in the rotunda reported less liberation/connection
than participants at the entrance kiosk, p = .021, all other p ≥ .62.
All three remaining facets also yielded reliable univariate effects: oppression/isolation,
F(4, 699) = 6.754, p < .001, η2p = .037; chills, F(4, 699) = 25.02, p < .001, η2p = .125; diminished
self, F(4, 699) = 16.601, p < .001, η2p = .087. Participants in the rotunda reported stronger chills

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

29

and diminished-self perceptions than participants in the parking garage, at the entrance kiosk, or
in the main hall arriving at the museum, all p ≤ .035, and less oppression/isolation than
participants in the parking garage, p < .001. Participants in the main hall leaving the museum
also reported stronger chills and diminished-self perceptions than participants in the parking
garage or at the entrance kiosk, both p ≤ .023, and stronger chills than participants in the main
hall arriving at the museum, p = .006. Surprisingly, participants in the rotunda or in the main
hall leaving the museum reported more oppression/isolation than participants at the entrance
kiosk or in the main hall arriving at the museum, all p ≤ .006.
How do prior knowledge and learning enjoyment relate to momentary awe
experience? As in Study 1, we averaged across participants’ ratings separately for knowledge
items (Cronbach’s α = .82, r = .695) and learning enjoyment items (Cronbach’s α = .74, r = .57).
As in Study 1, both knowledge and learning enjoyment were positively associated with
momentary liberation/connection: To the extent that participants reported more prior knowledge
and interest, they also reported higher levels of liberation/connection. A regression analysis to
control for the intercorrelation between prior knowledge and learning enjoyment revealed, as in
Study 1, that feelings of liberation/connection were predicted by prior learning enjoyment (β =
0.103, SE = .044, p = .019) but not knowledge (β = 0.021, SE = .042, p = .61).
The prior knowledge and learning enjoyment measures also showed some divergence:
Participants who reported more prior knowledge about art/architecture also reported stronger
chills (as in Study 1); participants who reported more prior learning enjoyment for
art/architecture also reported stronger curiosity and less oppression/isolation.
How does skepticism relate to momentary awe experience? A confirmatory factor
analysis did not provide evidence of adequate model fit (CFI = .88, RMSEA = .0719), but a

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

30

follow-up exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and oblimin rotation
suggested that most items loaded as predicted on three of the four factors; problems were
apparent with the questioning mind subscale, however, in that items purported to belong to other
subscales instead loaded onto this subscale, with the result that the factor had no clear theme.
Examining the internal consistency of the full 20-item scale yielded an acceptable Cronbach’s α
(.85); however, examination of the inter-item correlations suggested too broad a range of
correlations and several correlations that were unacceptably low (i.e., < .10). In general, the
factor structure supported the predicted structure, with three of the factors including only
predicted items; however, two factors emerged with content (i.e., factor loadings) that included
items from multiple theoretical subscales and that did not have clear themes. We thus decided to
use not only the total score (averaged across the 20 items), but also to calculate factor scores for
the three subscales where the evidence largely supported the theoretical factor content. We
included only the items that loaded onto the subscales in the exploratory factor analysis: search
for knowledge (5 of 6 items of the predicted items; Cronbach’s α = .85, inter-item r = .43–.71),
suspension of judgment (4 of 5 of the predicted items; Cronbach’s α = .67, inter-item r = .198–
.42), and self-determination (4 of 5 of the predicted items; Cronbach’s α = .81, inter-item r =
.37–.59).
As depicted in Table 3, to the extent that participants reported more curiosity and
liberation/connection, and less disorientation, oppression/isolation, and chills, they also reported
more overall skepticism. A regression analysis controlling for the inter-correlations among the
predictors revealed that chill and diminished-self perceptions both negatively predicted unique
variance in overall skepticism scores.

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

31

This pattern was largely replicated with the search for knowledge subscale, with the only
exception that search for knowledge was unrelated to chills: To the extent that participants
reported more curiosity and liberation/connection, and less disorientation and
oppression/isolation, they also reported greater interest in learning. A regression analysis
controlling for the inter-correlations among the predictors revealed that curiosity and
liberation/connection both positively predicted unique variance in search for knowledge scores;
surprisingly, amazement emerged as a negative predictor.
Suspension of judgment correlated only with liberation/connection, such that participants
who reported stronger liberation/connection also reported a stronger preference for unhurried,
carefully considered judgments.
As with overall skepticism, self-determination correlated negatively with disorientation,
oppression/isolation, and chills: To the extent that participants reported more disorientation,
oppression/isolation, and chills, they also reported a greater likelihood of reflexively accepting
others’ judgments. Interestingly, although overall skepticism correlated positively with
liberation/connection, the reverse was true for self-determination: To the extent that participants
reported more liberation/connection, they also reported less self-determination. A regression
analysis controlling for the inter-correlations among the predictors revealed that chills and
disorientation both negatively predicted unique variance in self-determination scores, and that
feelings of liberation/connection positively predicted scores.
How does visual thinking relate to momentary awe experience? VTS responses were
blind coded using a rubric with categories taken from a VTS study of critical thinking by Adams
et al. (2006) (Table 7). Each category included three codes: 0 (missing or irrelevant data), 1
(category not present in response), and 2 (category present in response). In each category, the

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

32

first 135 responses (19%) were independently coded by two researchers who reached an interrater reliability of 86%-96% across categories. The remaining responses were coded by one of
the researchers. For analysis purposes, 0 codes were removed and the remaining categories were
recoded as 0 (category absent) and 1 (category present). Because each participant saw two
images and were given three question prompts for each image, each guest had 6 items that were
scored as either 0 or 1.
We conducted exploratory analyses linking visual thinking and awe using separate
hierarchical logistic regression models for each VTS. Guest ID was the random effect for all
regression models. An omnibus model was run using each momentary awe factor to predict a
summary of all the VTS codes. Separate models were then run using unique momentary awe
factors to predict each VTS code.
The full results of the analyses are summarized in Table S1 of Supplementary Materials.
We found that higher scores on the oppression/isolation factor significantly predicted lower
scores on the composite VTS measure, p = .01. Thus, experiencing more oppression/isolation
was associated with less visual thinking overall. In terms of the models of the individual VTS
categories, higher diminished-self scores predicted higher scores in the VTS categories of
Observation and Intention, p = .008 and .04, respectively. That is, stronger diminished-self
perceptions were associated with increased ability to describe the roles and actions of people and
animals and generally narrating what is going on in the images. We also found that higher chills
scores predicted higher scores in the Evaluate VTS category, p = .03. In other words,
experiencing stronger chills was associated with an increased ability of guests to describe their
personal opinion about the images.

Discussion
In Study 2, we largely replicated the results of Study 1 in terms of participants’ awe
experiences in response to different museum locations and the associations between these
experiences and their prior knowledge and interest in learning about location-relevant topics.
Participants in the spaces expected to inspire awe (rotunda, main hall), relative to participants in
the spaces not expected to do so (parking garage, entrance kiosk) expressed greater amazement,
curiosity, chills, and diminished-self perceptions. Further, to the extent that participants reported
more pre-visit knowledge and learning enjoyment, they expressed stronger liberation/connection,
chills (knowledge only), and amazement (learning enjoyment only).
The knowledge and learning enjoyment results provided indirect evidence for a causal
impact of learning on awe, but in Study 2 we were also able to provide some evidence for an
impact of awe on learning-relevant variables. On a measure of visual thinking, stronger
diminished-self perceptions were associated with improvements in describing the actions and
intentions of others as seen in a visual image or artwork. Perhaps awe-related facilitation of an
attentional shift away from the self toward others and the world supported increased critical
appreciation and thinking about the image. The connection between observation codes and
intention–diminished-self relationship is consistent with this idea. We also observed that stronger
chills were associated with improvement in describing personal opinions, which might reflect the
fact that this facet of awe is the one most closely linked to the self-centered (i.e., embodied)
experience. Finally, we observed that stronger feelings of oppression/isolation were associated
with lower overall visual thinking scores. This underscores the point that awe, although an
epistemic emotion, might not always be a catalyst for interest in learning—especially when
associated with negative aspects of awe.

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

35

We also observed associations between awe and skepticism, operationalized in terms of
an enjoyment of learning (search for knowledge), a preference for considered and unhurried
judgment (suspension of judgment), and relying on one’s own judgment (self-determination)—
all of which are hallmarks of a willingness to engage in critical thought. We found that positive
awe—greater curiosity and stronger liberation/connection—was associated with greater
skepticism overall, and specifically with greater enjoyment of learning; liberation/connection
was also associated with a preference for careful, unhurried judgment (but also, paradoxically,
with a greater likelihood of accepting others’ judgments). Negative awe—greater disorientation
and stronger oppression/isolation—was associated with lower skepticism overall, and
specifically with less enjoyment of learning (but also, paradoxically, with a lower likelihood of
accepting others’ judgments).
Interestingly, diminished-self perceptions were not associated with skepticism, and chills
were associated with skepticism in surprising ways: Stronger chills were associated with less
skepticism and a higher likelihood of accepting others’ judgments. This facet of awe is
understudied, but these findings might be less surprising than they seem at first glance. The
assumption underlying our research and clearly explicated elsewhere (Coleman, 2014; Valdesolo
et al., 2017; Gottlieb et al., 2018; McPhetres, 2019) is that awe promotes engagement and
learning. However, giving careful consideration of the “chills” indicators raises the possibility
that the awe–engagement association may depend on the interaction of facet and timescale.
Although liberation/connection might serve to motivate outward attention in the moment
(because of the sense of connection), for example, chills might not have this motivational
impetus. If chills are experienced as pleasurable—particularly likely here, in that the awe
elicitors combined physical vastness with beauty—then individuals might be motivated to “stay

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

36

in the moment,” avoiding careful thought to maintain their ongoing affective state. They also
may relate chills to their physical presence, thus focusing attention to their body and personal
space. Thus, chills might function to imbue the eliciting information with positivity, promoting
future interest in learning, but might not engage critical thought in the moment. This is an
intriguing possibility that remains to be tested.
General Discussion
Museums and other cultural institutions are often in the business of awe. They design
their spaces and programming to inspire awe, often to the point of taking it for granted. In this
study, we measured awe in museum spaces to first test a priori assumptions that guests are
indeed feeling awe. Then we explored whether awe and its correlates were related to museum
guests’ epistemological relationships with the space and exhibit content and whether awe could
be used to encourage engagement and learning.
Across two studies, we explored the experience of awe within a science museum setting,
and its relation to learning-related engagement. With regard to the awe experience itself, we
observed striking consistency across the studies: Relative to baseline spaces, vast, beautiful
spaces (the rotunda and main hall) elicited positive awe-related emotions such as amazement and
curiosity, and stronger awe correlates in the form of stronger chills and diminished-self
perceptions. For their part, vast, spaces associated with more serious content (the U-505 exhibit)
also elicited amazement, stronger chills, and diminished-self perceptions—but also stronger
feelings of oppression and isolation. This could be a result of that particular exhibit being
designed to educate the guest on what life was like on a German World War Two era submarine
– which was both oppressive (living conditions) and isolating (alone in the ocean for months at a
time).

37

What makes these findings noteworthy? Aside from being able to demonstrate that
museum guests self-report differences in awe across settings in a theory-consistent way, they
also pave the way for exploring the impact of awe on learning-related engagement, or at least
indicators that suggest a positive orientation toward learning. Here, we also observed consistency
across studies: Examining the associations between awe and pre-visit knowledge about locationrelevant topics, we observed that those participants who reported greater pre-visit knowledge
also reported a stronger sense of liberation/connection and stronger chills in both studies. In
terms of pre-visit enjoyment of learning about location-relevant topics, we observed that those
participants who reported greater pre-visit learning enjoyment also reported not only a stronger
sense of liberation/connection but also more amazement in both studies; in Study 1, these
participants also reported stronger chills. Much of the support for awe as a learning tool is based
on awe being associated with surprise (Valdesolo et al. 2017). Our findings suggest that
appreciation was a stronger driver of awe than surprise.
We were also able to examine engagement and visual thinking as an outcome of awe. In
Study 2, subsets of participants completed measures of either visual thinking (associated with
more critical observation and communication skills) or skepticism (associated with more careful,
systematic use of evidence). We found that stronger diminished-self perceptions and chills were
associated with improvements in specific facets of visual thinking, but that stronger feelings of
oppression/isolation were associated with lower overall visual thinking scores. These results
provide some support for previous assertions that awe is a catalyst for learning (Valdesolo et al.
2017; Gottlieb et al., 2018; McPhetres, 2019), but also add a caveat, in that negative awe might
act as an inhibitor. Given other suggestions that negative emotions can be used as a catalyst to

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

38

stir interest (Sinatra, et al, 2015), one implication could be to use negative awe at the start of a
learning process and then transition to positive aspects of awe after interest is sustained.
Our results regarding skepticism similarly suggest that the proposed link between awe
and engagement and critical thinking is more complex than the “awe as a positive catalyst”
argument suggests. Although we found that positive aspects of awe (feelings of
liberation/connection, curiosity) were associated with more skepticism, we also found that
negative aspects of awe (feelings of oppression/isolation, disorientation) were associated with
less skepticism. We also found that stronger chills were associated with less skepticism. This
latter result was surprising, given our assumption that chills would be experienced as pleasurable
in the context of beautiful architecture (an assumption supported by above-midpoint mean scores
of positive awe and below-midpoint mean scores for negative awe). The relationship between
chills and other facets of awe, and the role of chills in engagement and learning remain to be
discerned.
The skepticism results are in line with Griskevicius et al.’s (2010) findings that awe was
related to improved ability to reject weak evidence in argumentation, which is a logical result of
more skeptical thinking. It is also somewhat in line with Gottlieb et al.’s (2018) findings that
“general positivity tends to run counter to awe” (p. 11). However, our results are in contrast to
Valdesolo and Graham’s (2014) findings that awe causes people to downplay uncertainty and
become more open to “supernatural” beliefs. Their study stimulated awe through the use of
nature videos on computer and video screens. We posit that the learning/new experience aspect
of awe is not as salient in memory-based awe experiences as in experiential awe simply due to its
inherent association with an experience they already had. Our results also differ from Darbor et
al. (2016), who found that people experiencing awe tended to reduce or downplay uncertainty. In

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

39

our case, there was a positive relationship between awe and skepticism. Ultimately, Darbor, et al.
suggests these differences could depend on how one defines the construct of awe. This is where
our more ecologically valid measurement of awe (experiential awe) is important as it measures
the levels of awe that people are experiencing in a real world situation using a wide variety of
cues. Therefore, one could interpret our measured construct of awe as being very broad, yet
importantly, our construct reflects how people feel and report awe in authentic situations. Why
would that be associated with skepticism? Perhaps because experiential awe creates a smaller
sense of self and a greater awareness of what one does not yet know. Awe induced in nonauthentic settings could be missing some of the elements associated with experiential awe since
it is not truly new (e.g., it is common to have seen imagery of the Grand Canyon, but it is less
common to have actually visited it). Further research using multifaceted instruments like the
SAS (Author et al., under revision) in laboratory settings may shed more light on this difference.
Importantly, our study shows that it is no longer appropriate to assume that states of awe are
equivalent in all people in all settings.
Awe and Museum Spaces: Implications for Learning
Awe in particular is a profound and complex amalgam of many other emotions. Perhaps
this complexity lends itself to awe being one of the most powerful emotional experiences in a
person’s life. Embedding ideas, concepts, and experiences in awe-related emotions may open the
mind to new ideas. However, it is not easily elicited in formal education environments that are
often constrained by financial and operational restrictions. Also, students tend to spend a very
large amount of time in those spaces (e.g., multiple hours per day in the same classroom for nine
months). As the novelty wears off, so can awe, even in the most inspiring of spaces. A visit to a

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

40

museum provides an opportunity to inspire awe for all types of learners, including guests,
visiting school groups, and educators attending professional development training and more.
The implications of these results cross the formal-informal education divide. For
example, educators leading school field trips may want to have post-visit discussions with the
class as soon as possible after the end of their visit, before the awe wears off. Perhaps this can
take place while waiting for the bus in a loading area or riding buses back to the classroom.
During that time, they can focus on the more complex topics they encountered in their visit,
while other aspects of their visit (e.g., affective responses) could be explored later in the
classroom. Exhibit designers could think about how to inspire awe in ways that do not require
grand, resource-intensive spaces. This could be especially useful to designers working for
institutions that have more limited physical and financial resources.
The limits of experiential awe should also be considered. We have found evidence of
negative impacts of oppressive aspects of awe on learning. Maybe a complex message, or one
that takes time to consider, should not be introduced while the guest is immersed in a heavy state
of awe. Along the same lines, our findings provide support for making spaces of reflection
available in areas that create awe, allowing guests to digest what is going on in their mind, as has
been suggested by other exhibit designers (McIntyre, 2009; Skydsgaard, Møller Andersen, &
King, 2016). Researchers should consider studying awe in more ecologically valid, real world
environments (Anderson, 2016). Like us, others have also shown differences in results from
studies done in laboratories vs. museums (Makin, 2017; Pelowski, Forster, Tinio, Scholl &
Leder, 2017; Silvia, 2017). Finally, much of the research on emotions in exhibits has shown a
greater impact on delayed measures, and recent work on positive impacts of awe on issues such
as social well-being and stress has lasted as long as one week after the awe inducing event

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

41

(Anderson, 2016). These combined with our current set of findings suggest that the next logical
future direction would be to conduct research on the long term cognitive impacts of awe.
Limitations
One clear limitation of these studies is their reliance on subject self-selection. Science
museum guests do not reflect demographics of society at large (Feinstein & Meshoulam, 2014;
DeWitt & Archer, 2017). Certainly, it would be important to test the replicability of our findings
with a different form of sampling. In terms of our focus on awe, however, we believe our results
cannot be attributed solely to the characteristics of our sample. Our participants did not selfreport as particularly awe-prone, with mean scores on the dispositional awe measure (Study 1)
being 1.47 (SD = 0.92) on a -3 to +3 scale, suggesting that they would be relatively unlikely to
differ dramatically in how much awe they experienced during their museum visit. With our focus
on investigating the impact of awe on learning-related variables, our ability to reliably evoke
different levels of awe across our target locations supports our ability to study its impact in this
setting, and our sample’s moderate levels of self-reported awe proneness supports our belief that
our results would replicate with a different sampling plan.
It should also be noted that we took a broad approach to measuring critical thinking by
using a technique, VTS, that involves the presence and use of evidence in our guests’ aesthetic
thinking. Prior research has shown VTS to be a sensitive measure of critical thinking in both
museums and science education settings (Adams, Foutz, Luke, & Stein, 2006; DeSantis &
Housen, 2007; Kisida, Bowen, & Greene, 2016; Curtin & McConnell, 2017; Moorman, Hensel,
Decker & Busby, 2017). However, critical thinking is a broad construct (Liu, Frankel, & Roohr,
2014) and there are likely other components of critical thinking that may be impacted by
experiential awe that could be explored using next generation critical thinking assessments (Liu,

AWE AND EPISTEMOLOGY IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM

42

Mao, Frankel, & Xu, 2016). In addition, the skepticism scale that we used was designed to
measure trait skepticism (Hurtt, 2010), but we used it here to measure state skepticism. The
current results demonstrate that the PSS is sensitive to situational changes, but its unvalidated
status as a state measure means caution should be taken in interpreting these results.
Conclusion
Recent studies have suggested that awe can sharpen the brain (Shiota, 2016). Most of
those studies have taken place in laboratory settings and involve awe induced by memory or
association. A goal of educational psychology is to address how people learn in real world
situations (Woolf, Woolf, Lane, Chaudhri & Kolodner, 2013). Museums are emotional places
(May, Schlictmann, Paneto & Ducharme, 2018) with both experiential and learning goals. As
such, they are in a unique position to test and determine whether there are connections between
awe and learning. The studies reported in this paper examined the experience of awe in a science
museum, and how that experience related to engagement in the form of skepticism and critical
thinking—and demonstrated that various facets of awe correlate with aspects of these
engagement indicators. However, these correlations were not all positive, underscoring the
importance of considering awe as a multi-faceted construct. Additional research will be required
to provide educators and museum program curators with the knowledge necessary to promote
awe in a way that helps them achieve their education goals.
