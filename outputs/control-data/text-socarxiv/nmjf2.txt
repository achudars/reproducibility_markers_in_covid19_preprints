Abstract
The study highlights English a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ perceptions about integrating
Blended Learning (BL) to facilitate them completing their foundation year English courses at a
Saudi university. The focus of the study was to investigate “the EFL learners’ perception about
integrating blended learning in their English Language Teaching (ELT) process”. For this purpose,
a survey was constructed in three subsections investigating the learners’ viewpoints about BL as a
platform: a) to improve learners’ interaction, b) to increase their interests, and c) to provide
autonomous learning. A mixed approach was adopted for the study to be conducted in one of the
largest universities in Saudi Arabia. The participants (n=120) taken as sample were studying
intensive English courses at four different levels as per the Common European Framework of
Reference (CEFR) during their first year at university. The data was collected by using the
designed survey consisting sixteen closed and an open-ended question to investigate the learners’
perceptions in depth. The results indicate an overall positive attitude of the learners towards BL
integration. ANOVA analysis of the variables shows insignificant effect of the ‘level of computer
proficiency’ and the ‘level of learners’ language skills’ on their perceptions. The results conclude
that the learners’ perceptions are found in favour of BL. Thus, it is recommended to integrate BL
to increase the learners’ interest, interaction, and autonomy.

EFL Learners’ Perception about Integrating Blended Learning

Bukhari & Basaffar

Introduction
An area where technology has had a stronger impact is the area of teaching and learning.
Researchers have been trying to find innovative teaching methods that can motivate students,
improve their interest in learning, raise their interaction, and boost their learning outcomes. Many
recent studies have focused approaches in different ways that lay emphasis on learning through a
combination of teaching-learning environments (Francis & Shannon, 2013; Banyen et al., 2016;
Hess et al., 2016; Linawati, 2016; Liu, 2016) and the most effective of them is blended learning
(BL). Recent investigation has made it obvious that BL is gaining a marked impression in the
higher education. It has an impact as the “harbinger of substantial change” at K-12 level (Dziuban
et. al., 2018). As Vera (2014) explains:
A purposive dedicated process of acquiring expertise, knowledge and skills through the
integration of in-class and extracurricular learning activities of educational process subjects
with the auxiliary of mutually complementary traditional, e-learning, distance courses and
mobile learning technologies under condition when learning activities’ time, place, path
and pace are self-controlled by the student (Vera, 2014 p. 209).
Vera (2014) defines the learners’ interactive communication through information technology as
basic apparatuses that increase the learners’ autonomy. BL model is based on combining face-toface and online teaching. BL was found to offer the learners a better learning environment than
that a face-to-face model or an online model (Jeffery et. al., 2014).
Learning becomes an appealing experience when both young and adult learners have a
user-friendly environment, a certain level of independence, a collaborative learning experience,
interesting material, and challenging tasks (Bukhari, 2015). Learners’ learning capacities,
differences, and individual Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86) are the most
important grounds to know and to reach an individual successfully. According to Bukhari (2016;
2019), the hidden talent can be ignited, and untapped learning potentials can be explored provided
that the productive interaction and constructive environment are available for all.
By using an experimental design, Yurdal and Ülkü Eser (2013) investigate the effect of the
use of virtual classroom and blended learning on students’ achievement and their attitudes
compared to the face-to-face method. Results show that the BL method had a statistically
significant contribution to the students’ achievements and their attitudes towards the course when
compared to the face-to-face method. BL was also found to be an effective way to avoid monotony
in teaching by providing collaborative learning to enhance student’s performance (Saltan, 2017)
in an interesting, stimulating, and productive way if well planned pedagogically and socially.
Literature Review
An investigation through a pilot study (Banados, 2006) concludes that the implementation of the
BL model proved to be successful after the team strived for four years. The results of the study
show a remarkable improvement of the learners’ linguistic competence by using an online
interactive interface. The researcher investigates the learners’ satisfaction via a survey at the end
of the pilot study and it showed a high level of satisfaction ratio. The study highlights that only
32% students wanted to have more time to finish.

EFL Learners’ Perception about Integrating Blended Learning

Bukhari & Basaffar

Several studies have investigated the effect of integrating BL in teaching. Waha and Davis
(2014) explore students’ ideas on combining online and face-to-face activities in a master’s
program in library and information science through a quantitative and qualitative study. Twentythree students’ responses to 40 open-ended and closed questions were used to collect data. The
information was gathered to know about the effectiveness and frequency of the model. Students
responded in favor of the blended learning model, showed interest in the flexibility and
convenience of the model.
Kuo et al. (2014) also find a high level of satisfaction among young students when
integrating BL especially among students with an extroverted personality. Participants were master
students enrolled in a BL course at university level. 22 students volunteered to respond to a survey
designed for the study. Findings indicate that the students were satisfied with their BL course.
Moreover, students with extroverted personality showed a higher level of satisfaction. They
perceived interaction as an important part of their learning experience. Thus, BL was found more
engaging than the general method of delivering a course.
In 2017, Wichadee implements a BL model using Edmodo as a tool in language learning.
The study aimed at examining the effectiveness of the model in relation to oral proficiency,
motivation, and attitude. A quasi-experimental design was employed to collect the data using tests
and questionnaires distributed among 84 Intermediate students taking English course. Findings
indicated that BL was effective. Students in the experimental group outperformed those in the
control group in oral proficiency and were highly motivated. The researcher concluded that the
blended learning model implemented in this study proved to be useful for learners for its ability to
promote content connectivity and student interaction.
In contrast, different results related to attendance, attitude, and confidence have been revealed
through a case study conducted by Saltan’s (2017). He investigates the learning experience of
students studying pedagogic formation in a blended design. Although Saltan (2017) found BL as
highly promising regarding professional development, learners indicated that face-to-face learning
was more applicable, authentic, and effective than the online part.
Based on a crucial idea to “bridge the gap” (Bukhari, 2019 p. 127) between learners and
teachers, Neumeier (2005) investigates a flexible BL design by combining modes and using
parameters’ framework. To make BL as a better experience for all, the study focused on designing
and implementing ‘Jobline LMU’. Neumeier’s study concludes that the BL design and the modes
with face-to-face phases in combination with computer assisted language learning (CALL) are
very important to make BL a useful experience for all.
Sagarra & Zapata (2008) highlight some suggestions to have the benefits of using online
workbooks, materials, feedback method etc. to make online learning a ‘user-friendly’ experience
for most learners. They tested 245 Spanish class learners in class and via electronic workbook and
distributed a questionnaire to have the participants’ perceptions concerning the e-book, the
experience of blended modes. The study concludes that the students found CALL as helpful in
improving linguistic areas. The study also concludes that 74.2% found the online homework as
interesting and 43.4% enjoyed doing it.

EFL Learners’ Perception about Integrating Blended Learning

Bukhari & Basaffar

Another study used an observation and a survey to conclude that the use of technology in
a BL environment intensifies the language learning by “forming deep and reliable skills”
(Lyulyaeva & Shapiro, 2018). Learner centered strategies combined with information technology
make a blend that proves to be a highly effective tool in the field of English Language Teaching
(ELT) specially when it comes to teaching EFL learners (Arkhipova et. al. 2017). According to
Bonk & Graham (2012), learners perceive BL as an opportunity and conceive it a convenient
source where they can be more expressive and independent with the flexibility of time and hours.
Research Problem
In the Arabian Peninsula, ELT has faced many challenges (Bukhari, 2016) specifically because
English is a foreign language in the region (Moskovsky & Picard, 2018; Mahboob, & Elyas, 2014;
Kachru, 2006). Although, students follow intensive courses taught by highly qualified staff
consisting of very structured classes for 18 hours a week, the results are not always satisfactory.
Students starting the program with a low level of language skills, show below expected progress
during lessons (classes) conducted in face-to-face mode for about four months spent at one level.
Depending on the schedule, all learners spend extensive face-to-face sessions per week. Due to the
course intensity and long hours of daily scheduled lessons, many students lose interest which
results in dropdown of the attendance (Alkaff, 2013). Implementing an interactive course material,
running assignments, conducting skill-based learning activities, and launching students centered
activities face a lot of challenges either due to fluctuating attendance or lack of energy exhibited
by the learners during face-to-face language sessions. Such situations compel EL teachers to make
timely adjustments, be vigilant to opt alternatives, and have innovative ideas to ignite the learners’
interest to have a successful completion of the English language course (Bukhari, 2019 p. 127).
Considering the drop of learners’ interests, loss of teachers’ efforts, and increased
challenges on both sides, the researcher hypothesized to work out the students’ perception on
integrating blended learning in ELT. The study aimed at collecting the learners’ perspectives
which is crucial to scrutinize further, whether the idea motivated the students, excited positivity
towards BL as an opportunity to increase their interaction, and sense of being independent learners,
which is highly desirable in such a situation.
Research Questions and Hypotheses
Considering the effectiveness of the blended learning environment, the aim of the present study is
to investigate leaners’ perception about implementing such a model in their context. The research
is an attempt to answer the following questions:
1. What are the EFL learners’ perception about integrating blended learning in ELT process?
a. Do the learners find the integration of BL more interesting?
b. Do the learners believe that the integration of BL will increase their interaction?
c. Do the learners think that the BL environment will boost their autonomy?
The hypotheses to be tested are:
1. Learners show a positive attitude towards integrating BL in English Language Teaching
2. Learners believe that implementation of BL can increase their interaction
3. Learners believe that BL can help them become more independent

EFL Learners’ Perception about Integrating Blended Learning

Bukhari & Basaffar

Methodology
This study is a mixed method research mainly focusing on EFL learners’ perceptions about
Blended Learning in ELT. The aim of the study was to investigate the learners’ point of view about
the effect of blended learning on learners’ motivation, interaction, and learning autonomy. The
study was conducted in one of the largest universities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Foundation
year female students studying an intensive English course at the English Language Institute (ELI),
Women Colleges Campus at King Abdulaziz University, were the participants of the study.
Participants: Sample of the Study
The students enrolled for the foundation year course with structured classes for 18 hours a week
was the convenient sample of this study. Chosen convenient sample size consisted 120 female
learners studying at four different Levels of English (A1, A2, B1, and B2) according to Common
European Framework of Reference (CEFR) criteria. The data collection phase initially started by
taking students’ consent to respond to the survey. 120 female students willingly answered the
questionnaire. Table 1 shows the distribution and the size of sample of the study comprised of
participants from four levels whose identity was kept anonymous. A consent was taken before the
data was gathered on a questionnaire designed and distributed among the participants.

BL environment (Al Zumor, et al., 2013). Each of the sections contained a certain number of
statements focusing on: a) Blended Learning is Advantageous and Interesting (statements 1-5); b.
Blended Learning is Interactive (statements 6-10); and c. Blended Learning as Convenient and
Independent Learning (statements 11-15). Statement no. 16 (“I find that the proper way of learning
depends on…) was used to investigate the learners’ overall perception.
Last open-ended question was about “suggestions and/or comments”. It was used to have
the learners reveal their suggestions or in-depth opinions about the blended learning environment.
The data collected through the open-ended question was to have the qualitative analysis. The
researchers first prepared the survey in English then translated it into Arabic to facilitate the
learners to understand without any confusion or difficulty. To answer the question about
“Learners’ perception about integrating blended learning in their EFL learning process”, the data
was analyzed for the 15 main statements divided into three sections covering the learners’
perceptions and ideas of integrating blended learning in the English course. The responses on the
questionnaire were collected within a two months’ period.
Data Results and Interpretations
The data gathered through the questionnaire was checked for reliability using SPSS v. 17.0.

to the statement no.1 that blended learning is more interesting. However, 9.1% learners disagreed
(D8 + SD5=13) and 23.9% (N=34) stayed neutral to the statement. 97 (68.3%) learners agreed to
the statement no.2 “Blended learning is more useful”, while 17 (12%) learners disagreed to it and
28 (19.7%) were neutral. Learners’ perception about the blended learning as convenient and
flexible learning investigated through the statement no.3 is positive as 78.9% learners (A44 +
SA68 =112) agreed to the statement. The table also highlights that 71.8% of the learners (102)
responded as ‘agreed’ for the effectiveness of blended learning (the statement no.4), which is more
than the percentage of the learners (9.2%) who overall disagreed. About 64.8% learners responded
in favor of the statement no.5 that learners feel more confident when they use English online (BL),
however 21.1% remained neutral and 14.1% disagreed to that.
Conclusively, it can be inferred that the Blended Learning English course is considered as
advantageous and interesting by the learners and they find it more flexible, convenient, and a useful
way to improve confidence by practicing online along with the face to face sessions.

To gauge the learners’ response on BL as an interactive learning, the questionnaire comprised
variables to explore multidimensions. Statement no. 6 about the learners’ ideas on BL (as a
supportive platform to improve communication between students) received 63.4% (SA 21.1% +
A 42.3%) responses in agreement, 23.2% responses were neutral, and 13.4% (D 12%+ SD 1.4%)
disagreed to it. Whereas, the statement no.7 about the learners’ perception on BL as a platform to
benefit the students from other students’ communication received the second highest percentage
proving that BL is an Interactive platform of learning. A total 117 learners (SA 40 + A 77)
responded in agreement. 5 learners (3.5%) disagreed and 20 (14.1%) remained neutral. 83.8
recorded as the highest percentage (48+71=119) that indicates stronger agreement of learners
towards the statement no.9, however, 3.5% disagreed and 12.7% responded neutral. It exhibits a
strong inclination towards the perspective that BL benefits the learners with teachers’ feedback.
Therefore, it can be interpreted that majority of the learners perceive blended learning as providing
an effective interactive environment, where they can not only benefit themselves from the peerfeedback and peer-interaction but also get teachers’ feedback, teacher/students’ suggestions,
others’ comments to improve, and enjoy multiple patterns of interaction.

Table 5 represents the analysis of the learners’ perceptions on the variables investigating
BL as convenient and independent learning (statements no. 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15). The response
on statement no.11, BL as a platform for learners to work according to their own pace, received
75.4% learners’ agreement (SA 33.1% + A 42.3%), 14.1% as neutral, and 10.6% (D 8.5% + SD
2.1%) disagreed to it. The statement no.12 regarding the learners’ perceptions on blended learning
environment being supportive for effective time management received 88 learners in agreement,
36 responded neutral, and 18 disagreed. About 76% learners (SA 34.5% + A 41.5%) agreed to ‘BL
as an independent task work environment’ (statement no. 13), however, a minimal ratio (9%)
‘disagreed’ and 17.6% learners responded neutrally. Statement no.14, investigating the learners’
perceptions on ‘Through Blended Learning, I can learn the way I like to learn’ received 75.4%
(SA 29.6% + A 45.8%) responses as ‘agreed’, 20.4% as ‘neutral’, and 4.2% (D 3.5% + SD 0.7%)
disagreed. The learners’ interest in BL at university and finding it convenient (statement no. 15).
was recorded as 55.6% (SA 21.8% + A 33.8%) in agreement, but 28.9% responded neutral and
13.5% disagreed. To infer, it can be stated that most learners perceive BL as convenient and
independent learning where they can work autonomously on their own pace.

EFL Learners’ Perception about Integrating Blended Learning

Bukhari & Basaffar

To explore more about the amalgamation of the face-to-face sessions integrated with the
online sessions in a BL setting, the questionnaire included statement no.16 to investigate the
learners’ perception on the ratio of the amalgamation of face-to-face combined with the online
sessions. Table 6 shows that 60 learners favored the design of the BL having integration of ‘60%
face-to-face and 40% online’ sessions. 34 (23.9%) learners chose the ‘50% face-to-face and 50%
online session’ 26 (18.3%) learners favored the idea of integrating ‘100% face-to-face session’,
and 15 (10.6%) learners chose the ‘40% face-to-face and 60% online’ integration. Largely, it can
be deduced that the majority of the learners chose for the combination of the ‘60% face to face and
40% online’ sessions.
Considering the scattered size of the participating learners as the sample of study and the
learners’ enrolled at four different levels at the ELI English courses, the variable ‘Level of English’
was tested through ANOVA for its effect on the dependent variables. The number of learners at
Level-104 was the highest [66 (46.5%)] among the participants who responded to the
questionnaire, in comparison with the learners from Level-101 [19 (13.4%)] Level 102 [6 (4.2%)],
and Level-103 [51 (35.9%)] who took part in the study.
It is clear from the Table 7 that there was no significant effect level on the learners’ perception of
blended learning environment and its integration in EFL classes. Thus, it can be interpreted that
learners’ perceptions are strongly in favour of the integration of BL in the English course at
university.

Table 8 shows the variables (16 statements) tested against the learners’ computer literacy
skills have not proved to be significant (no values are less than the p=0.05 value). The table also
shows insignificant statistical correlation found between the learners’ perceptions about BL and
their level of computer literacy skills. As shown through the Table 1, there were differences among
the learners’ level of computer literacy skills. However, the learners’ response in agreement to the
statements used to measure their perceptions about BL integration was in favour. Therefore, it can
be deduced that the learners’ level of computer literacy skills didn’t affect much their perceptions
about integration of the BL in English course. When tested through ANOVA, all the values
calculated are nonsignificant (none of them found below the p-value =.05).
The open-ended question was about learners’ suggestions or comments. The students mentioned
that online learning should be integrated when needed, especially when face-to-face classes are
not possible. Most learners expressed their strong inclination towards joining BL classes not only
in their English language courses but in different subjects as well. They expressed their interest in
joining BL classes as an alternative instead of staying long hours in the classroom. However, they
specified the fact that it is possible through the existence of planning and strong internet server.
Findings and Discussion
Findings obtained from study strongly supports the literature, see for example (Hess et al., 2016;
Linawati, 2016; Banyen et al., 2016; Lyulyaeva & Shapiro, 2018). Participants of the study showed

Bukhari & Basaffar

a positive attitude towards integrating blended learning in English language teaching. The data
revealed an above average percentage of interest found among learners for the online courses to
be taught along with the face-to-face sessions, i.e., 67% as compared to 9% learners who did not
find blended learning more interesting than face-to-face. Moreover, 68% of the participants
believed that blended learning is more useful, leaving 12% learners who disagreed with the
statement, and 20% were not sure about it. However, the element of enjoyment and friendly-user
effect was recognized by the respondents who favored the BL environment. Majority of learners,
79%, agreed to the fact that BL is a more convenient and flexible way of learning with a percentage
of 72% who responded that it is an effective way of learning. Findings, therefore, confirms the
first hypothesis that students have a positive attitude towards BL as the other studies reported the
positive perceptions of the learners (Sagarra & Zapata, 2008).
Considering the second hypothesis, the results established that the learners believe in the
implementation of BL to increase their interaction. As per results, an above average, 63% of the
participants, believe that blended learning enhances teacher-students’ interaction. They also
believe that online platforms are a good way for students’ communication and can serve for the
purpose of the informal or formal feedback sessions. Overall, participant learners in this study
strongly believe that BL can create an interactive learning environment in EFL courses which can
raise the chances of self-learning experiences for the students as reported by Garrison & Kanuka
(2004). As per third hypothesis, learners believe that the blended learning can help them become
more independent, it is interesting to see through the responses that 75% of the participants
perceive it a convenient source providing more independent learning environment with flexible
timing (Bonk & Graham, 2012).
Conclusion
To sum up, participants in this study positively perceived blended learning as an interesting,
interactive and independent learning environment for EFL courses regardless of their English
language level or computer literacy. The highest percentage of learners were in favor of
incorporating 40% of online learning leaving 60% for face-to-face learning. The open-ended
survey question revealed opinions in depth. Learners’ expression of their strong interest in BL
classes was found in favour of English courses. They find it as an alternative for long hours in
class sessions. It is also evident that the learners are aware of the fact that BL prerequisites a good
planning and a strong internet connectivity. However, some are of the opinion that online learning
should only be integrated when needed, i.e. if face to face learning is not possible.
Finally, the study exposes the learners’ inclination towards the BL integration as recorded through
the method applied during investigation. Certain factors analyzed through learners’ responses
determine that there is a need for “substantial change’ and BL integration since the mode of study
at K12 level has transformed with the incorporation of technology (Dziuban et. al., 2018). BL is
becoming a center of interests and achieving a significant impact at certain levels in Higher
Education (Waha & Davis, 2014).
Clearly, the derived results of the study are encouraging, and the voice of the learners
support the idea of BL seen as an effective mode to enhance the learners’ interaction, autonomy,
and interest, and beneficial to cause reduction in the long hours study mode. As for the course
studied for about a whole year spending long hour in class-sessions, there is need to have BL. The

Bukhari & Basaffar

learners’ interest more into face-to-face learning hours is clear through the results (Table 7) that
signify clear ration of (42.3%) n=60 learners in favor of having integration of ‘60% face-to-face
and 40% online’ sessions’ (Saltan, 2017). The learners perceive that BL platform has potential to
improve the teaching and learning process in an educational environment and it can be a
convenient way of ELT and learning (Neumeier, 2005). Eventually, we can assume that the
contemporary study-hours have increased the pressure which is mostly challenging and exhausting
for both the teachers and learners (Alkaff, 2013) therefore, BL environment can provide
convenient and independent learning which can enhance interaction among learners.
Recommendation
The perception about integrating BL and creating an environment with a combination of the online
and face-to-face learning was investigated in the study. An overall positive attitude was found
indicating Saudi female learners’ belief that BL can boost their interest, increase interaction, and
help the learners to become more independent. Based on these results, it is strongly recommended
that at least 40% of the curriculum should be designed to be presented online. Learners should
avail online learning platforms, since the computer age has raised up its usage at all spheres of life.
The research recommends that the institutes should arrange for platforms like LMS, Blackboard
etc. ready with online materials to incite interest of the learners and BL to be used to reduce the
long face-to-face hours for learners as not to lose interest in the L2 course throughout the
foundation year. Moreover, the online part should be pedagogically appropriate and well planned.
Including interactive platforms where learners can post and discuss their ideas with their teachers
as well as with their peers should be part of the online course.
Since feedback functions as an essential part of the learning process, the teachers should
regularly provide it using both modes the online and the face-to-face sessions. The sample size of
the study is a nook to hook the problem at smaller scale, conducted on 120 female students as
study sample. It leaves a ground to focus a larger sample size including male learners. Teachers’
perception can also be a part of an investigation as teachers play a noteworthy role in ELT.
Conducting individual interviews and focus groups can give a more in-depth understanding on
how learners perceive integrating BL in their curriculum. Other streams of investigation can
explore the types and usefulness of the BL materials, measuring learners’ level of interests and
interaction during BL courses, BL in contrast with the only face-to-face sessions etc.
