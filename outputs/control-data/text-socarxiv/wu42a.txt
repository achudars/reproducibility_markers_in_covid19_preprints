THE IMPACT OF “DE-ESCALATION” ZONES
IN SYRIA
Ramnath Reghunadhan
Research Intern, CAPS

The Syrian Civil War has entered its seventh year and has accounted for more than 500,000
killed, over 1 million injured and over 12 million Syrians living as refugees or Internally Displaced
Persons (IDPs). It started in 2011, partially due to the ripple effect caused by Arab Spring in the
nations along the West Asian and North African (WANA) regions, and also due to the resentment of
the population to the Syrian regime led by Bashar Al Assad. What began as peaceful protests in March
2011 erupted into violent, brutal attacks, all culminating into the bloodiest conflict in the 21st century,
which saw intervention by many State and non-State actors like Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra Front and the
like.1 The involvement of foreign powers led by the US and its allies in Europe and West Asia
exacerbated the situation, when they started arming, funding and training rebels and/or terrorist
groups. The other prominent actors like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia supported the rebels and/or
terrorist groups, while the Syrian forces were supported by Iran, Iraq and Lebanon-based militia
group, Hezbollah, and lately by the Kurdish groups.2 In 2015, Russia too intervened in Syria to back
the government forces. In April 2017, the US administration carried out its first direct military action
against the Syrian government, launching cruise missiles at a Syrian air force base.3
On 4th May 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Iran, Russia and
Turkey (IRT) in Astana, regarding the creation of “de-escalation zones”, which came into effect on the
next day at around 9pm.4 The initiative was proposed by Russia (Syrian Government’s most powerful
ally) supported by Turkey and backed by Iran.5 The IRT is designated as “Guarantors” and is intended
to reduce the military tensions, to bring back the refugees as well as internally displaced persons
(IDPs) and stabilise the political condition of Syria. IRT is expected to effectively tackle terrorist
groups like ISIL (DAESH), Al-Nusra Front and its affiliates, while continuing efforts to include the
groups that haven’t yet joined the ceasefire regime. IRT “have reaffirmed their strong commitment to

the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity” of Syria, as incorporated in the United
Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2254, adopted two years back in December 2015.6
The de-escalation zones are areas or regions that are to be marked as separate de-militarised
enclosures. The IRT will station their troops here to de-escalate violence as well as to provide security
to civilians, and to the military establishments of the Syrian government and the IRT. The ceasefire
will be in place for an initial period of six months, which could be prolonged based on the consensus
that emerges within IRT. The de-escalation zones include the four areas located across eight of Syria's
14 provinces, which are:


the first zone includes Idlib, Latakia, Hama and Aleppo and contains regions dominated

by Al-Qaeda affiliates, comprising more than one million civilians;


the second zone is in the Homs province, where approximately 180,000 civilians are

located in the Al-Rastan and Talbiseh enclaves but controlled by groups that are predominantly
affiliated to al-Qaeda;


the third zone is the eastern Ghouta (northern part of Damascus), which has around

700,000 civilians, and is prominently controlled by Jaish al-Islam; and


lastly, the fourth zone comprises Daraa and Quneitra provinces in southern Syria, which

is prominently controlled by rebels, with the border being controlled by Jordan. Here civilians
amount to around 800,000.7
The general overview of “de-escalation zones” articulated by IRT is given in Image1.

After two weeks of signing of the Memorandum, IRT is also expected to form a JWG (joint
working group) to delineate the lines of the de-escalation areas and security zones, as well as to
resolve other operational and technical issues regarding the implementation. The steps shall be taken
by 4th of June 2017 for the preparation of the detailed maps.8 The IRT is expected to enable rapid, safe
and unhindered humanitarian access within the de-escalation zones, and provide conditions to
restore basic infrastructure facilities, including provision for accessibility to water supply, medical
assistance, electricity and distribution networks. There shall be security checkpoints and observation
points to ensure compliance of ceasefire.9 The details of Joint Working Group (JWG) are also yet to be
devised and agreed upon by IRT. While the US reacted with skepticism, 10 there was positive response
from the UN11 and the Syrian Government.12
However, there is a need for a clear mechanism to resolve conflicts and violations within the deescalation zones, and that is yet to be clearly articulated. There is also a need to clarify on how and
where the troops of IRT are being stationed, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the like.13
The MoU doesn’t specify an initiation period for implementation of the zones and differences may

arise regarding the involvement of Iran particularly by actors who have been traditionally hostile to
Iran, or were ideologically as well as militarily positioned against each other in crisis situations. The
effectiveness of the establishment of a no-fly zone is yet to be contemplated, as the both USA and
Russia predominantly depended upon bombing of targets to achieve their desired operational
results.14 The manner in which IRT will try to engage the terrorist groups, especially ISIL and other AlQaeda affiliates needs to be discerned.
The effectiveness in bringing back refugees and displaced people is a prominent question. This is
because large number of the population will lack evidences or documents like passports, property
deeds, identity cards, most of which may have been lost during the bombardments, conflicts or during
fleeing. These create issues for the verification, validation and certification of Syrian civilians and
create problems for transition through the frontline checkpoints and observation posts, where most
of the refugees and IDPs will be log jammed and will be unable to enter. This will, in practice, develop
issues for an effective implementation of the right to voluntary return, resettlement and repatriation
of civilians. There will be problems like lack of property restitution and compensation, coupled with
lack of livelihood opportunities or overly dependent population on aid, which will most probably
result in related issues like human trafficking, smuggling, drug trafficking and the like.
