ABSTRACT
Transportation planners increasingly use new forms of online public participation alongside
traditional in-person approaches, including crowdsourcing tools capable of encouraging
geographically specific input. Digital involvement may be particularly valuable in exploring
methods to plan at a megaregional scale. Research is beginning to address digital inequalities,
recognizing that broadband and smartphone access may restrict opportunities for disadvantaged
groups. However, the geography and equity of participation remain pragmatic issues for practice
and research. This paper reviews the geography and equity of the participation methods in
Austin, Texas for active transportation (bicycling and pedestrian) through three approaches to
co-produce informed plans: in-person meetings, public participation geographic information
system (PPGIS), and an emerging smartphone platform that logs trips and encourages input on
route quality. In addition to spatial analysis with standard deviational ellipses, we include
qualitative case analysis to contextualize the geographic and equity implications of different
participation approaches. Results show that both online techniques resulted in a larger geography
for participation than in-person meetings, with the regional PPGIS covering the most area.
However, review of the income levels in each area shows that use of the smartphone-based
crowdsourcing platform was aligned with lowest-income areas. This study shows that online
participation methods are not homogeneous regarding geography or equity. In some contexts,
smartphone applications can help reach lower-income communities, even when compared with
in-person meetings. Crowdsourcing tools can be valuable approaches to increase geography and
equity of public participation in transportation planning.

INTRODUCTION
Transportation planning at the scale of a megaregion, while conforming to best practices in
participation, creates a paradox—how can planners effectively involve the public to guide
planning over an area that does not have transportation in place to support data collection and
engagement? Online approaches, combined with traditional techniques, make pragmatic sense
for scaling up participation. Megaregional scale presents three challenges for planners: larger
areas are more likely to have information gaps across the geography, they are more likely to be
formatted and quality-controlled differently in different jurisdictions, and traditional face-to-face
meetings are difficult to apply evenly across such a large area. This study evaluates
crowdsourcing as one potential perspective to support transportation planning at widely varying
scales. Active transportation planning in Austin, Texas, serves as case study material, focusing
on the geographic breadth of public participation received at the local level using three categories
of involvement: face-to-face meetings, online text-based methods, and a smartphone app
crowdsourcing platform used by the city. Generally, crowdsourcing is an online, participatory
approach that distributes a problem to communities for bottom-up input. The crowdsourcing app
platform addresses challenges in bicycle planning, such as understanding where the community
is currently able to safely and comfortably bicycle, and where roadways present problems and
barriers. This study evaluates evidence from a local bicycle transportation context to determine
the challenges and opportunities for crowdsourcing in megaregional planning, finding that online
participation methods may help expand geographies of participation, and are not necessarily
associated with higher-income areas.
The objective of this study is to evaluate crowdsourcing as a method for public participation in
transportation planning to equitably scale from local and regional to megaregional contexts,
through local planning evidence in Austin, Texas. This paper includes sections on the
background of online participation, description of the data and methods used, before discussion
and conclusions drawn from this case.
Previous Research
Public participation is a well-acknowledged requirement of transportation planning in most
democratic societies, and is generally required at all levels: local, regional, state, and national,
for (1). No evidence suggests that megaregional planning should be different—we can expect
citizens to demand involvement in any public planning process that involves significant
resources or impacts (2). Structures of governance and involvement at the scale of a megaregion
are nascent or non-existent (3–7). One study does report that metropolitan planning organizations
may offer the flexibility to help address megaregion problems, but “without formal funding or
structures, MPOs have limited time and staff to apply to megaregion planning and tend to limit
participation to projects or studies with direct and immediate benefits such as interregional rail
plans or data access” (8). The scales involved with translating a robust approach including
customized outreach, stimulating public interest, and then targeting community groups, could
increase the cost and time of public participation over large areas (9). Megaregions, then, could
be a particularly challenging context for participatory planning.
Communicative, collaborative, and co-productive participation approaches can include
traditional and digital methods. Traditional public participation focuses on the use of language to
support and direct planning to serve the needs of the community. This approach comes from a

Griffin & Jiao
background that focuses on the conditions of discourse as meeting communicative ideals (10,
11), or supports public re-framing of planning challenges and approaches of working together
through collaborative processes (12). Previous studies emphasize spatial alignment of
participation with a specific project (13), but more general projects such as long-range
transportation plans require broad outreach. Online forums and social media provide spaces for
discussion that can support engagement, if structured to reach the right audience and decisionmakers understand and support the approaches (14–17). However, co-production between the
state and public offers an alternative perspective. In co-productive planning, emphasis is shifted
from words to actions—the public can be responsible for generating the data necessary for
planning decisions, in addition to performing other tasks alongside, or in place of state
sponsorship (18, 19). However, when digital technology is involved in co-productive processes
such as crowdsourcing, varying levels of digital inclusion creates an opportunity for bias that
could further disparities by race, education, and income (20–22). Co-productive planning
processes may support additional ways for people to guide their future communities, but
integration of technologies must consider the role of distributional biases.
Genuine public involvement involves pulling people into the planning process—potentially
involving review of existing conditions, analysis of challenges, and review of draft concepts, at
the very least (23, 24). Therefore, a participatory transportation planning process for
megaregions would have to solve challenges of data availability, quality, and communication
across an area that currently has no governance structure to support such an effort (3, 25).
Ideally, it would also include geographically specific information to support specific responses
that lead to plan improvement (26). Participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) may
offer a way to combine all of these issues by citizen-produced data, but traditional approaches to
PGIS leave open questions of accuracy and coverage (27). Tim Nyerges identified the need for
democratic process combined with objective information about places, presenting “scaling up as
a grand challenge” that community-based GIS faces (28). Crowdsourcing is an online approach
to solving problems with a “deliberate blend of bottom-up, open, creative process with top-down
organizational goals” (29), used in transportation for more than a decade (30–33). PPGIS that
includes a specific top-down task that is guided by a platform to consolidate data formatting and
accuracy, with bottom-up contributions by people knowledgeable about local conditions,
amounts to what could be called a crowdsourced geographic information system (CGIS). This
approach may be a match to what Peckett and Lyons identified as a future research problem
specific to transportation planning for megaregions: “Uncertainty remains as to how
megaregions can best encompass top-down leadership and bottom-up activities and how to
transition between informal and formal megaregion activities” (8).
Research Questions
The challenges of megaregion transportation planning are documented (4), but little or no
empirical research exists that suggests how public participation could scale to the megaregion,
suggesting two research questions:


What are the geographic differences of spatial representation between face-to-face
meetings, an online public participation GIS, and the smartphone-based crowdsourcing
platform for bicycle transportation planning in Austin, Texas?

Griffin & Jiao


Were the distributional biases different between the three categories of involvement?

A previous synthetic review of literature suggests that future research on participatory spatial
technologies must include the actual engagement process, rather than merely examining the
technologies themselves (34). Therefore, this study contextualizes the analysis of crowdsourcing
with an empirical case, using evidence from Austin, Texas. To address these questions requires a
mixed-methods approach, including quantitative data to answer the first question, and qualitative
insights for the second.
PARTICIPATION DATA
The data for participation come from three different public participation processes in Austin, and
represent three different participation purposes. The participation methods represent
professional-quality engagement efforts in a single region, but each are tailored for the separate
processes. Therefore, comparison of geographies in this study must be considered in the context
of each separate planning process—the comparison of different planning processes might be
likened to a fruit basket, rather than ‘apples-to-apples’. This limitation is a tradeoff that enables
analysis of real, ex post participation within one region, rather than simulated or modeled results
that may show little about the way actual participation methods work. Further, we could not
obtain full comparison demographics for participants, which limits our ability to assess equity
directly—we instead employ locational demographic data as a proxy for actual participants. We
did include limited available demographics from contributors to the PPGIS and smartphone app.
The participation data show spatial results in the context of each planning case within the Austin
region. The three following planning processes were separate, but the context changes minimally
since they all take place in Central Texas.
In-person Meetings
In-person meetings were held for development of the 2014 Austin Bicycle Master Plan Update
and were one part of a broad engagement process that included a telephone survey, an urban trail
intercept survey, an online survey, a virtual open house, and discussion at multiple City of Austin
boards and commissions meetings (35). City staff advertised attendance for the in-person open
houses and meetings through their electronic newsletter and other media, in addition to
presentations with community-based organizations including the Austin Chamber of Commerce,
the Austin Neighborhoods Council, and others. Though few in number, the meetings connected
interested persons with city staff directly—a rich engagement approach not afforded by online
methods. Meetings were held at easily recognized locations, including Lanier High School, and
in partnership with larger events, such as the African American Cultural Heritage Festival (35).
Demographics of participants were not recorded at the meetings. Table 1 shows that 144 people
participated in the in-person meetings, contributing input on the draft plan concepts before
further review by the city’s boards and commissions. The plan reports that “after this preliminary
round of public meetings, City staff worked to incorporate the feedback and comments
received”, followed by sixteen meetings with boards, commissions and council briefings before
the plan was approved by City Council on November 6, 2014 (35).
Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS)
The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)—the regional transportation
planning agency for the Austin area—used a public participation geographic information system

Griffin & Jiao
(PPGIS) called “WikiMap” in development of the 2045 Regional Active Transportation Plan
(36). This method supported public contribution of knowledge to the planning process through
an online tool that allowed people to click a location on a computer-based map, and identify
barriers and other issues for bicycling and walking. This approach was only part of a broad
engagement process that included public meetings, e-newsletters, social media, tabling at
community events, and other methods. The WikiMap tool “allowed residents to identify barriers
and difficult routes for walking and biking” and “providing information about their preferred
routes” (36). Since this organization’s focus is region-wide—a seven-county area surrounding
the capital city—the geography of participation is expectedly broad, in comparison with methods
focused only on the city. Participation on the WikiMap skewed male (65%), young (29% aged
30 or younger), and white (72%). Table 1 shows more than twice the number of people involved,
compared to the city’s in-person meetings, which is comparable with the overall population of
the region as nearly double that of the core city. CAMPO used public contributions via the
WikiMap to draft an “unconstrained” network as a basis for the local and regional priority
networks in the regional plan (36).
Bicycling Smartphone App in Austin
The Austin Transportation Department used a smartphone application that records contributors’
bicycle trips, detected automatically using the phone’s accelerometer and GPS, called Ride
Report (37, 38). The city promoted the use of the platform to people who bicycle primarily
through their social media channels and electronic newsletter (39). The app detects the
conclusion of a bicycle trip and prompts users to rate a ride as positive or negative. It minimizes
user involvement and battery consumption to encourage consistent use. The platform aggregates
multiple overlaid trips by all participants to compute an average rating, in addition to recording
the total count of users for each roadway and trail segment. In this way, results from use of the
app provide planners with information about bicycling in a city as reported by its users. The
gender split of the app users was similar to the PPGIS platform—68% male, but age and race
data were not available. Table 1 shows use by 1,234 people in the Austin region, but note the
period involved is longer than three years in total. The city reports the “feedback will help to
inform how the city prioritizes investments in the bicycle network – every ‘not great’ rating tells
the city where dollars may be needed, and best spent” (37).

SPATIAL ANALYSIS
We addressed the first research question using case study and crowdsourcing materials gathered
from Austin-area bicycle planning staff and from the bicycle app. City meeting records for recent
planning efforts were obtained, identifying geographic locations for the location of participation.
Each of the participation methods was geo-statistically analyzed in terms of spatial extent.
Finally, individual interviews with at least two bicycle planning staff at the City of Austin were
used for two purposes. First, the city planners’ insights helped evaluate the initial quantitative
findings of the first research question, providing member checking as a form of external
validation (42, 43). Second, interviews help describe how planners used the three types of
participation and worked through issues of geographic scale.

Griffin & Jiao
The second research question builds from an analysis of the first, comparing the spatial location
of the three involvement methods with educational attainment and income levels associated with
the locations of each. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance will indicate differences
between the methods, regarding the level of distributional bias observed from the case materials.
Planner interviews were used as a check against the initial findings, and offer insights as to
potential methods to mitigate biases present.
Geography of Participation
To assess the geography of participation, we follow previous work calculating the directional
distribution of participation through a standard deviational ellipse, of each participation
technique (44–46), which simplifies the geographic range of participation. Equation 1 shows the
calculation of the standard devotional ellipse, 𝑆𝐷𝐸 “where 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖 are the coordinates for
feature 𝑖, {𝑋̅, 𝑌̅} represents the mean center for the features, and 𝑛 is equal to the total number of
features” (46).

Figure 2 shows the second standard deviation, including 95% of the participation points for each
participation method. By excluding five percent of spatial outliers for each dataset, this approach
provides a comparable analysis, recognizing that each method was part of a unique planning case
for different purposes.

Figure 2. Directional Distribution of Participation

Table 2 shows the participation geography of the PPGIS used by CAMPO to be largest by far,
which is appropriate considering the broader geography of the agency’s representation. This
online tool shows the potential for use across a large area, without participants having to meet at
a given location at a particular place and time. The angle of rotation is calculated as the tangent
of the deviations, based on the same mean center of the deviational ellipses calculated in
equation 1, further described in software documentation (46). The directional distribution in
Table 2 shows the northeasterly skew of in-person meetings, with a more north-south orientation
of use of the bicycle app, likely reflecting the distribution of bicycling in the core area of the
region.

Equity of Participation Results
The geographies of participation also relate to a potential income bias, as well. Figure 3 shows
the percent of low-wage workers by census block group in 2010, through longitudinal employerhousehold dynamics (LEHD) data from the Smart Location Database (47). The highest levels of
low-income households are in the east-southeast area of the central city, in addition to the rural
edges of the region.

Figure 3. Percent of Low-Wage Workers by Participation Ellipse

When simplified through averages among block groups with their centers in each participation
geography, Table 3 shows use of the bicycle app covers areas with the largest percentage of low
wage workers, as compared with other engagement approaches and the region as a whole. This
does not mean that the users of the app necessarily represent low-wage workers, however. More
research is needed to determine whether there are significant differences in the routes chosen by
app users as compared with the broader population, or low wage workers in specific. However,
the geography of participation reviewed in this study does suggest that online crowdsourcing
approaches for public participation are not necessarily representing higher-income areas.

Interviews with two planners in Austin show concern for bias in participation via crowdsourcing
centers around access to technology, rather than location of the resident or in-person
participation. One planner suggested that crowdsourcing does not represent the entire population,
simply describing that “bias should be assumed until proven otherwise”. The planner continued,
noting that ideal crowdsourcing tools would include “feedback systems to reach new desired
users”.
Another planner suggested a difference between not being able to control whether participants
had smartphones that would give them access to “tools like Ride Report, Strava, or others [that
rely] on cooperation from the community,” and whether people “hear about the tool and are
willing to use it”. Therefore, the planners provided both in-person and online methods of
participation, and found interesting ways to connect the two. Interviews showed that more recent
planning work by the Austin Transportation Department (following the 2014 Bicycle Master
Plan) includes staff present at public meetings with tablet computers to facilitate digital input
from in-person participants. In this way, planners provide a variety of methods for public input,
yet consolidate the information using tools that are efficient for the planners.
When questioned about the overall impact of crowdsourcing on transportation planning, one
planner described it as “generally positive”. However, they suggested it “requires transportation
professional[s to] have a strong understanding of the limitations as to the crowd they are
sourcing to make sure that those populations that lack access to tools that crowdsourcing relies
on are not underrepresented in the decisions”.
IMPLICATIONS FOR MEGAREGIONAL PLANNING
Through analysis of the geographies of participation approaches and interviews with planners,
this study shows three main implications for transportation planning in megaregions, regarding
geographic scale, co-production, and multi-method participation. Crowdsourcing tools scale
geographically, providing a practical method for engaging populations across large areas. The
PPGIS showed use across the largest area, but this could be related to CAMPO’s broad regional
outreach; whereas the City of Austin’s efforts were logically related to the core area.
Crowdsourcing is co-productive in the sense that people can contribute knowledge about specific
planning topics in a structured manner for use by planners. Crowdsourcing tools facilitate
gathering this information with GIS attributes such as latitude, longitude, and time, in addition to
related variables, in a way that planners can easily incorporate into a planning process.
Optimally, this facilitates incorporation of public input that actually led to planning results.
Interviews with planners suggest the methods are practical, even if they raise important questions

Griffin & Jiao
about bias that require careful approaches. Finally, multiple methods reach the broadest
population meaningfully. Planners explained that they find crowdsourcing tools useful in their
work, and practical for participants, but that some bias must be expected when digital tools are
used. Planners in the City of Austin and CAMPO use a range of tools to broaden public
engagement, while structuring input that can be useful.
Collecting useful public input data has always been a problem in megaregion planning.
Crowdsourcing provide useful methods to gather many structured public inputs over large areas
(e.g. megaregions) during a short period of time, which are likely to be particularly helpful for
megaregion-scale planning. These examples of planning from local and regional transportation
planning suggest potential along these lines, but more research is needed to evaluate real impacts
over the medium and long term. Moreover, the mismatch of time and planning contexts for
participation methods limits the value of direct comparisons. Additional studies of similar issues
using randomized and crossover case design are needed to confirm participation effects.
None of these seeming advantages and problems should suggest that crowdsourcing tools
provide a useful alternative to in-person participation in traditional public meetings. Rather,
interviews with planners showed increasing need to find ways to combine a variety of methods
in a way that is practical for both broad publics and planners. As the city and region’s long-range
plans are put into practice, the programming of funding and completion of projects will provide
additional data to evaluate the ex post impacts of crowdsourcing as a public engagement method.
New scales of planning likely require new approaches to the paradox mentioned at the beginning
of this article—how to conduct effective public involvement over an area exceeding the space a
megaregional approach to transportation. Taken together, findings from this study suggest that
meaningful public engagement for megaregional transportation planning may require large scale
online approaches, such as crowdsourcing and participatory mapping, in addition to traditional
methods. The methods may be combined as well. A hypothetical example could include a large
crowdsourcing effort to develop initial datasets on a key issue (such as bicycling stress in the
vicinity of potential high-speed transit stations), public meetings to review interim results, and
then participatory mapping (both online and at public meetings) for commenting on draft
mapped solutions. Public participation methods exist to scale up planning for megaregions.
Transportation planners should engage with online tools as options for public participation, and
effective use of PPGIS and purpose-built apps such as in this study may help tailor and broaden
participation.
