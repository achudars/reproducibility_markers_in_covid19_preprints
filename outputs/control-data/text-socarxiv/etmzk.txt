Import Inflows of Bangladesh: The Gravity Model Approach
Abstract
Bangladesh suffers from a chronic deficit in her trade balance. The paper is an attempt to
explore the imports of Bangladesh which is one of the most significant factors responsible
for unfavorable trade balance of the country. The aim of the study is to intend some
initiatives for an attempt to ultimately reshaping the trade balance of Bangladesh with her
foreign trade partners. The paper examines the existence of the gravity theory for the
imports of Bangladesh with its eight major trading partner countries- India, China,
Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, USA and Malaysia. The data set consists of
yearly data from 1985 to 2003 in a panel approach. The paper comes across with the
findings that the gravity theory is consistent with the imports of Bangladesh. That is, the
geographical distance of Bangladesh with its partner countries has significant impacts on
its imports. But in near future this may change because of different factors such as
profitability, easy trade procedures, product delivery time etc. that influence the imports
decision more than does the geographical distance. This paper finds mixed relationship
between the GDP and imports of Bangladesh. It also shows that the imports of Bangladesh
influence the domestic production very little because Bangladesh mostly imports
consumer goods rather than capital goods. Moreover, the population of Bangladesh has
significant impacts on imports which in turn implies that Bangladesh is not capable of
producing adequate consumer goods to meet the increased demand resulted from high
population growth. It also shows that partner countries‟ GDP has significant positive
impacts and partner countries‟ population has mixed impact on imports of Bangladesh.
This paper concludes that it will be an alarming situation for trade balance of Bangladesh
if the imports continue to increase in such a pattern that the rate increases five to eight
times more in respect of population increases and at the same time the ratio of capital
goods in proportion of total imports decreases.

1. Introduction
In the past, national economies were relatively self-contained entities, isolated from each
other by barriers to cross-border trade and investment; by distance, time-zones, and
language; and by national differences in government regulations, culture, and business
systems. As these barriers are being minimized by taking different initiatives, the
contribution of cross-border trade to the development of national economy is becoming
significant. The economic development of Bangladesh is also, to a significant extent,
affected by the trade flows with partner countries. Although Bangladesh suffers from a
chronic deficit in her trade balance (Table-1), scope might be found to explore the most
significant factor(s) responsible for unfavorable trade balance with a view to take some
initiatives for an attempt to ultimately reshaping the trend of Bangladesh‟s trade balance
with her foreign trade partners.
Import is one of the moist important factors responsible for trade balance. Due to trade
deficit where import is higher than export, the imports of Bangladesh need to look from
different dimensions. While analyzing on imports, the import trading partners also get
focus. In addition, recently the imports of Bangladesh also have started to move from
1

border country to other countries. Though Bangladesh shares three of her borders with
India and none with China, China has emerged as the largest source of import for
Bangladesh replacing India for the first time in 2006 (Table-2). The value of imported
amount of Bangladesh was 13.75b taka from China and 12.41b taka from India in 20052006 fiscal, where in 2004-2005 it was 12.33b taka from India and 6.94b taka from China.
The gravity model is a popular formulation describing the trade flows between different
geographical entities. The theory says that there is negative relationship between
geographical distance and trade volume which indicates that the lower distance influences
for more trade and vice versa. As the imports of Bangladesh are geographically shifting,
this paper aims at analyzing the gravity theory for Bangladesh. Moreover, this paper also
finds out the impacts of home GDP, partner countries‟ GDP, home population, and partner
countries‟ population on the imports of Bangladesh.
2. Literature Review
The empirical studies by Tinbergen (1962) and Linnemann (1966) showed trade flows
follow the physical principles of gravity: two opposite forces determine the volume of
bilateral trade between countries - the level of their economic activity and income, and the
extent of impediments to trade. The latter includes, in particular, transportation costs, trade
policies, uncertainty, cultural differences, geographical characteristics, limited overlap in
consumer preference schemes, regulatory bottlenecks, etc. National borders are among
these impediments, even for industrialized countries (Anderson and Van Wincoop, 2003).
Although trade potential primarily results from the matched export capacities and import
demand (microeconomic), on a more aggregated level of analysis, proximity in demand, in
per capita income, in space, and in culture, are the potential macroeconomic determinants
of export. Thus various combinations of macroeconomic variables, such as gross domestic
product (GDP) and population with geographic distance, are significant predictors of trade
potentials. Hence, gravity equations have been used extensively in the empirical literature
on international trade (Havrylyshin and Pritchett, 1991; Frankel and Wei, 1993; Bayoumi
and Eichengreen, 1997; Evenett and Hutchinson, 2002).
Filippini (2003) used a gravity Equation model to analyze trade flows between East Asian
industrializing countries (including China) and some developed countries in order to show
the remarkable trade performance of East Asian countries. The study showed that all
coefficient signs were consistent with model assumptions and found high propensity of
Asian countries (including China but excluding Japan) to exchange high-tech
manufactured products with Japan and USA. Another interesting result was that among the
East Asian economies, China plays a very important role as an exporter and as an importer
too in recent years.
Martinez-Zarzoso (2003) applied the gravity model to annual bilateral exports between 19
countries. His results indicated that incomes of exporter and importer, as expected, had
positive influence on bilateral trade flows. Population had a large and positive impact on
import, indicating that bigger countries import more than do small countries. Regarding
transport infrastructure, he found that exporting countries‟ infrastructure fosters trade.
Achay. (2006) investigated the determinants of trade flows between various countries of
the world. He applied the gravity model on a sample of 146 countries for five-year subperiods between 1970 and 2000. According to this study, GDP, distance and regional
2

integration agreements are the determinants of trade. It is also found that all estimated
coefficients were statistically significant and their signs were in conformity with
expectations. The adjustment quality of the model as measured by determination
coefficient (adjusted R2) was quite high, standing at 71 percent. It was found that GDP,
GDP per capita, common frontier, common official language, common currency or
common colonial past have a positive impact on the volume of bilateral trade. On the other
hand, the geographical distance had a negative impact on the volume of trade.
Very few studies on Bangladesh have been conducted so far in this area, which is perhaps
due to unavailability of information, particularly regarding trade inflows and outflows
with partner countries. Rahman (2004) applied a generalized gravity model to analyze
Bangladesh trade flows with its trading partners using the panel data estimation
techniques. The study estimated the gravity model of trade (sum of imports and exports).
The results showed that Bangladesh‟s trade is positively determined by the size of the
economies, per capita GNP (gross national product) differential of the countries involved
and openness of the trading countries. The major determinants of Bangladesh‟s exports
were found to be exchange rate, partner countries‟ total import demand, and openness of
the economy. All these factors affected Bangladesh‟s exports positively whereas
transportation cost was found to be a significant factor in influencing trade negatively.
From the extensive literature, gravity equations share common features that can be
customized for different purposes: First, a gravity equation is bilateral; Secondly, gravity
equations can be derived from various theoretical trade models (Deardorff, 1995) and
finally, a gravity equation may be used in order to estimate either determinants of the
volume or determinants of the nature of trade flows.
3. Data and Model Specification
Classical gravity models generally use cross-section data to estimate trade effects and
trade relationships for a particular time, for example one year. In reality, however, eight
cross-section data observed over several periods (panel data methodology) result in more
useful information than does cross-section data alone. There is couple of advantages of
this method. First, panels can capture the relevant relationships among variables over
time. Second, panels can monitor unobservable trading-partner-pairs‟ individual effects. If
individual effects are correlated with the regressors, OLS estimates omitting individual
effects will be biased. Therefore, the paper used panel data methodology for testing
empirical gravity.
This panel study covers yearly data for Bangladesh and its eight major partner countries
from 1985 to 2003; a balance panel of total 912 observations. The countries - India, China,
Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, United States of America (USA) and
Malaysia- are chosen based on the share of total import volumes of Bangladesh. These
eight countries cover most of the imports of Bangladesh (Table-3). Bangladesh imported
64 percent in 1996, 60 percent in 2001 and 2002 of its total import from these eight
countries.
<< Table 3 >>
Data for total import flows of Bangladesh (million US$) have been taken from Economic
Review of Bangladesh. Then it has been converted into real value by adjusting with the
3

US consumer price index (constant year 2000). GDP data are also in real term (constant
2000 million US$) that have been taken from World Development Indicators (WDI-2007)
database. Population data (in million) were also taken from World Development Indicators
(WDI-2007) database. Geographical distance in kilometers has been gathered from a web
based database (www.timeanddate.com). All of these data have been converted into
logarithmic (ln) format. For the statistical output, the SAS has been used and for the panel
regression, the TSCSreg procedure has been used.
In 1687, Newton proposed the “Law of Universal Gravitation.” It held that the attractive
force between two objects i and j is given by,
Fij = G (MiMj / D2ij)

(1)

Where notation is defined as follows, Fij is the attractive force, Mi and Mj are the masses,
Dij is the distance between the two objects and G is a gravitational constant depending on
the units of measurement for mass and force.
This model originates from the Newtonian physics notion. Newton‟s Gravity Law in
mechanics states that two bodies attract each other proportionally to the product of each
body‟s mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of the distance between their respective
centers of gravity (in meters). The gravity model has been applied to a wide variety of
goods and factors of production moving across regional and national boundaries under
different circumstances since the early 1940s (Oguledo and Macphee, 1994).
The gravity model for trade is analogous to this law. The analogy is as follows: “the trade
flow between two countries is proportional to the product of each country‟s „economic
mass‟, generally measured by GDP, each to the power of quantities to be determined,
divided by the distance between the countries‟ respective „economic centers of gravity‟,
generally their capitals, raised to the power of another quantity to be determined”
(Christie, 2002). This formulation can be generalized to,
Mij = K Yi β1 Yj β2 Dij γ popi δ1popj δ2

(2)

The linear form of the model is as follows:
ln (Mij) = K + β1 ln (Yi) + β2 ln (Yj) + γ ln (Dij) + δ1 ln (POPi) + δ2 ln (POPj) (3)
The basic statistical model is specified in the following logarithmic form in which five
variables are assumed to determine the import flows to Bangladesh from its major trading
partners:
ln (Mij) = α + β1 ln (Yi) + β2 ln (Yj) + γ ln (Dij) + δ1 ln (POPi) + δ2 ln (POPj)+ ut (4)
where, Mij is the flow of Bangladesh‟s (i) imports from partner country (j), Yi is
Bangladesh‟s GDP, Yj is the partner countries‟ GDP, Dij is the geographical distance
between Bangladesh‟s (i) capital city to partner countries‟ (j) capital city, POPi is
Bangladesh‟s population, POPj is the partner countries‟ population, u is the random error
term and β, γ, δ are the structural parameters.

4

Here, this paper also observes the result for the basic model excluding the population
variable from Equation no.-4, because there are few very highly populated countries such
as China, India, and USA are available in partner countries‟ list that may impact the
overall results. In this case the model is:
ln (Mij) = α + β1 ln (Yi) + β2 ln (Yj) + γ ln (Dij) + ut

(5)

The general hypothesis of the model is that the economic size of the importing countries,
Mij, are usually measured with GDP. The estimated coefficients are usually close to the
predicted value of one. If GDP of a country increases, the country is expected to import
more from foreign countries. The same holds true for the partner countries that are
exporters. So, both β1 and β2 are expected to be positive.
Distance is usually measured using the “great circle” formula. This formula approximates
the shape of the earth as a sphere and calculates the minimum distance along the surface.
As the distance between countries becomes larger, imports will fall. The distance is a
factor, which is used as a proxy to consider the impact of transport costs and other
transaction costs. Hummels, et al. (2007) have argued that shipping costs (freight charges
and marine insurance) can go a long way towards explaining why distance matters.
Distance indicates the time elapsed during shipment. For perishable goods, the probability
of surviving intact is a decreasing function of time in transit. In gravity model, distance is
a resistance factor and has a negative impact on volume of bilateral trade. As a result, γ is
expected to be negative.
The coefficient of population of the exporters may have negative or positive sign
depending on whether the country exports less when it is big (absorption capacity) or
whether a big country exports more compared to a small country (economies of scale). For
similar reasons, the coefficient of importer population may have negative or positive sign
(Martinez-Zarzoso and Nowak-Lehmann, 2003). Therefore, the expected signs of δ1 and
δ1 may be negative or positive.
4. Results of Analysis
As the data has been taken from the countries of different regions and different economy
sizes, here pooled OLS is not used. Moreover, geographical distance is fixed and not time
sensitive. When working with constant data over time, time effect provides no output. Due
to time constant, variable included in the equation-4 and equation-5, fixed effect model
does not provide a good output. Moreover, m-value of Hausman test for equation-4 is
insignificant, even in 90 percent confidence level which indicates to use fixed effect
model. However, m-value of Hausman test for equation-5 is significant at 99 percent
confidence level which indicates to use random effect model.
<< Table 4 >> << Table 5 >> << Table 6 >><< Table 7 >><< Table 8 >>
<< Table 9 >> << Table 10 >><< Table 11 >><< Table 12 >><< Table 13 >>
Domestic GDP has no significant impact on the imports of Bangladesh both in random
effect and fixed effect model for the qeutions-4. However, the GDP of Bangladesh shows
significant positive relationships with imports of Bangladesh both in random effect and
one way fixed effect model for the qeutions-5. The coefficients of determination (R2) of
5

random effect models for both cases indicate that 80 percent of the total variation in the
dependent variable is accounted for by the independent variables that indicate good fit of
the model. However, a qualitative focus can give an in depth idea about the study. Imports
criteria show that it influences the domestic production very little because Bangladesh
mostly imports consumer goods rather than capital goods. One third of total imports of
Bangladesh were capital goods in 2000, but in recent years the rate declines to 9 percent in
2004-05, 11 percent in 2005-06, and 12 percent in 2006-07 (Table-14). As a developing
and trade deficit country it is alarming for Bangladesh that the rate of total imports is
increasing but the ratio of capital goods is decreasing.
<< Table 14>>
Due to time irresponsible fixed value, the fixed effect models do not provide any output
for geographical distance variable. The random effect models show significant negative
impacts of geographical distance on the imports of Bangladesh, which is accepted at the
99 percent confidence level for both equation-4 and equation-5. It is noted that here the
sign of the coefficient is negative, means less geographical distance influence for higher
import and vice versa. This result supports the theory of gravity model. However, recently
Bangladesh has started to move its trade from lower distance country to higher distance
country. The model of gravity mainly considers the geographical distance for trade, but the
reality is more complex that might cause the inconsistency of this result in near future.
There are lots of factors available that go beyond the assumption of gravity theory, such
as, Bangladeshi importers are interested in China because it is offering goods with a wide
price range, easy trade procedures, many duty free goods, shorter timing of shipment etc.
China usually sends its products to Bangladesh within 25 days on an average by
completing all the formalities while import from India takes 35 days. Many Chinese
products, such as, food stuff, plastic goods, rubber goods, wooden products, raw hides,
pulp, papers, electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof, sound recorders and
reproducers, television accessories of electronics articles, boilers, machinery and
mechanical appliances, parts thereof, Cotton, yarn/thread and cotton fabrics etc., are cheap
compared to the same quality products of India.
Both random effect and one-way fixed effect models show that domestic population has
significant positive impacts on the imports of Bangladesh (equation-4). At 96 percent
confidence level, one-way fixed effect model shows that 1 percent increases in domestic
population will lead to 5.65 percent increases in imports of Bangladesh. And at 99 percent
confidence level random effect models show that 1 percent increases in domestic
population will lead to 7.19 percent increases in imports of Bangladesh. That means
Bangladesh is not capable to produce enough in proportion of increasing demand due to
population growth. As a result, demand for import increases five to eight times of the rate
of its population increases.
Partner countries‟ GDP has significant positive impacts on the imports of Bangladesh both
for equation-4 and equation-5. If Bangladesh imports more, the partner countries will
produce more to meet the demand of Bangladesh. Fixed effect model shows no impact of
Partner countries‟ population on Bangladeshi imports, where random effect models show
significant negative impact.
5. Conclusion

6

Recently trade of Bangladesh is decreasing with its border countries and trade volume is
increasing with far distance countries, such as, the case of China and India. Therefore, to
find out the impacts of gravity model on the trade patterns of Bangladesh, its import is
tested on home GDP, partner countries‟ GDP, geographical distance between home capital
city and partner countries‟ capital city, home population, and partner countries‟
population.
The paper finds mixed results for the impact of Bangladeshi GDP on its imports. If
population is not considered, GDP shows positive relationships with imports of
Bangladesh. In a quantities focus, imports criteria show that it influences the domestic
production very little because Bangladesh mostly imports consumer goods rather than
capital goods. Further, population of home country has highly significant impact on
imports of Bangladesh. It in turn implies that Bangladesh is not capable of producing
enough in proportion of increasing demand due to population growth. Partner countries‟
GDP has significant positive impacts on the imports of Bangladesh and partner countries‟
population has mixed results on imports of Bangladesh.
Most importantly it is found that geographical distance has significant impact on imports
of Bangladesh which means transport costs and other transaction costs, such as, the
probability of surviving intact of perishable goods etc. still have significant impacts on its
import. But in recent phenomenon, the imports are more influenced by profitability, easy
trade procedures, product delivery time etc., rather than the geographical distance. As a
consequence, policy makers need to conduct further serious studies to find out the
relationship, if any, between trading pattern, geographical distance and trade deficits of
Bangladesh. Policy makers also need to carefully consider the future alarming situation for
trade balance of Bangladesh if the import increases continuously in such a pattern that the
rate increases five to eight times more in respect of population increases and at the same
time the ratio of capital goods in proportion of total imports decreases.
