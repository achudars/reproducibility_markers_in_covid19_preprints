Empirical Assessment of Good Governance in the Public Sector of
Malaysia
Abstract
To improve the trust of citizens and delivery of services, employing good governance
principles in the public sector is very crucial. Despite efforts to improve service delivery,
criticisms and complains toward public services remain evident. This study aims to assess the
status of good governance practices in the public sector of Malaysia. Primary data were
collected from the responses of 109 department heads under 24 federal ministries to a survey
questionnaire. Respondent perception of good governance practices was measured using a
seven-point Likert scale and analyzed by descriptive statistics and path measurement
modeling. Standard diagnostic tests were also conducted to check the reliability of the data
and model. Results indicated that nine factors were significant in the measurement of good
governance practices. However, very few people in the public sector of Malaysia practice
fraud control, which is at the lowest intensity. Among the service groups, the engineer group
practiced good governance at the highest level, whereas the health service group practiced
good governance at the lowest level. Therefore, still there are scopes available to improve
good governance systems to become more reliable and efficient public sector in Malaysia.
Findings of the study will help policy makers improve the efficiency of the public sector of
Malaysia and other countries.

1. Introduction
The transformation of Malaysia from a developing country to a developed one is ongoing.
Only four years to go before 2020, the year when Malaysia is targeted to become a fully
developed nation. Vision 2020 is a program that encourages Malaysia to develop
economically, socially, and politically through the enhancement of government systems,
social and spiritual aspects, and national satisfaction and confidence (The Malaysian Digest,
2014). Good governance is considered as an important element to achieve Vision 2020.
Strategies have been introduced to improve the quality of good governance in the Malaysian
public sector, while cultivating integrity across all segments of the country (The New Straits
Times Online, 2014). Many reform initiatives have been conducted since 1980s, such as
''Clean, Efficient and Trustworthy'', ''Integration of Islamic Values'', ''Excellent Work
Culture'', ''Code of Work Ethics'', ''Client‟s Charter'', and ''ISO 9000''.
Moreover, the Malaysian Institute of Integrity (MII) was established to cultivate compulsory
human capital and knowledge resource within the civil sector (Rusnah et al., 2011). The
National Integrity Plan (NIP) aimed to mitigate corruption, misconduct, misuse of power, and
improve efficiency and effectiveness of the public delivery system by 2008. In 2009,
Malaysia introduced a new approach toward transforming the government and public sector
by focusing on six National Key Results Areas (NKRAs) under the Government
Transformation Programs with the objective of changing the government machinery to be
more effective in its service delivery and be accountable for outcomes that matter most to
people as well as to aid the country in becoming an advanced, united, and just society with
high standards of living. Administrative reformation to improve government accountability
2

and strengthen the public sector was identified as the most important area for the benefit of
the people and the progress of nation, as well as a crucial step of the government to maintain
public confidence and the determination of the government in implementing good
governance in the public sector.
Despite efforts to improve service delivery, criticisms and complaints toward public service
remain to be heard. The public sector continues to face criticisms for its inefficiency, red
tape, lack of flexibility, ineffective accountability, and poor performance for a long period of
time (Siddiquee, 2006). Moreover, Malaysians are still under the impression that the public
sector is easily manipulated by malevolent people, and this perception has dampened public
confidence in government institutions that allegedly practice corruption in government
procurement and in business transfers at the local municipal level and demonstrate land
excision abuse and land transfer fraud (The Star, 2008). According to Iyer (2011), poor
service delivery reflects gaps in accountability, inequalities in policy planning, and
inadequate coordination across public agencies. Furthermore, a number of issues in
Malaysia‟s public sector are on accountability, integrity, and ethical behavior.
These issues had been highlighted prior to 2012 in the report of the Auditor General,
including issues on the negligence of public officials who fail to uphold their duty of
protecting government interest. Several weaknesses have also been observed during the audit,
including improper payment, overlooked specifications or low-quality/unsuitable items in
procurement, unreasonable delays, wastage, weaknesses in revenue management, and
management of governments assets (National Audit Department, 2013). The report further
discussed that the weaknesses are due to the negligence of officers, such as their inability to
comply with the rules and regulations, lack of monitoring, lack of project management skills,
and failure to attend to the outcome/effect of programs/activities/projects, resulting in the
wastage of a significant amount of money.
An example is the case of the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) in the
procurement of shoes for its personnel, which was managed by its headquarters from 2009 to
2013. By the end of 2012, audit findings revealed that the shoes purchased in 2009 was yet to
be distributed at the end of 2012 and that a total of 7,659 pairs of shoes were damaged and
must be disposed (National Audit Department, 2013). The mismanaged procurement of the
shoes by RMCD has resulted in a significant loss to the government. The matter, which is
still under investigation, has incurred a cost to the government and reflected in the coffers of
the government as because of the inefficiency and negligence of the officers responsible in
procurement or of those responsible in the distribution of the shoes.
Another finding from the report revealed that the lack of control in asset management by the
Royal Malaysian Police has led to the acquisition of invaluable assets, such as firearms and
handcuffs, by the government. An inefficient integrity system in the management and
security of assets could threaten public safety. According to the National Audit Department
(2013) from 2010 to 2012, valuable assets were reported missing. From the perspective of the
auditor general, the overall management of lost assets by the Royal Malaysian Police was
unsatisfactory. This finding has generated concern among the public on the integrity and
accountability of public agencies to protect national security, while failing to manage and
control assets efficiently.
In terms of project management, the auditors also discovered the highly priced procurement
activities of the Ministry of Defense, which were supposed to be conducted by a tendering
3

process divided into four quotations. The failure of officers to adhere to treasury instructions
has tarnished the image of the ministry and the public sector as a whole. These few cases
highlight numerous weaknesses that lead the public to question public sector management of
employees and adherence to integrity, responsibility, and accountability in the
implementation of good governance.
In Malaysia, the Anti-Corruption Agency was established in 1967 to contain corruption and
all kinds of mismanagement in the society. However, the high level of corruption in Malaysia
has rendered most of the agency‟s strategies and campaigns as seemingly insignificant in
containing and fighting corruption (Siddiquee, 2009). Moreover, the Asia Pacific Fraud
Survey Report Series of 2013 reported that Malaysia, together with China, have the highest
levels of bribery and corruption. In addition, the TI Bribe Payers Index Ranking of 2002
presented Malaysia as number 15 out of 21 countries.
The Malaysian government has implemented initiatives in terms of programs and budgets to
ensure the efficient management of public money. Measures have also been implemented to
monitor the performance of good governance practices in the public sector. Therefore, this
study attempts to explore the current level of good governance practices in the public sector
of Malaysia. The findings of this study will also help policy makers of other countries in
ensuring good governance practices in the public sector.
2. Literature Review on the Factors of Good Governance
Governance can be understood as the process of decision making and the process by which
decisions are either being implemented or not. Governance can be used in various contexts,
such as corporate, international, national, and local governance. The government acts as one
of the actors who play a major role in governance, while other actors depend on their position
in the government. Good governance has a number of factors that affect quality elements in
the public sector (Aziz et al., 2015 a,b,c; Said et al., 2015, 2016). Based on the literature,
these elements are described as follows.
2.1 Strategic Alliance
Dickson, Phelps, and Waugh (2010) defined alliance as “inter-firm cooperation that falls
between the extremes of discrete, short-term agreements and the complete merger between
organizations”. Meanwhile, Glaister et al., (2003) defined international alliance as a
cooperation between firms of different nations. Alliances involve a number of forms, such as
joint ventures, equity alliances, non-equity alliances (Li, 2008), merger and acquisitions
(Wiklund and Shepherd, 2009), licensing contracts (Baker et al., 2008), and partnerships
(Bu¨yu¨ko¨zkan, Feyzioglu and Nebol, 2008).
Firms and institutions often do not keep all the necessary resources and capabilities to
compete successfully. However, strategic alliances present an option for these firms and
institutions by obtaining opportunities that would otherwise be unobtainable with the firm‟s
existing capabilities. In principle, alliances would allow partner firms to combine resources in
the formation of joint competitive advantage (Teng and Das, 2008). Forming a strategic
alliance has been recognized as a valuable route for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) for them to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage (Cannatelli, 2012).
Ohame (1989) stated that technology is gradually becoming more complicated because of the
enlargement of new key products. The difficulty in monitoring primary resources has
4

encouraged businesses to adopt strategic alliances to share basic knowledge and to ensure the
production of new research technologies. According to Tie (2004), the lack of strategic
alliances between schools, family members, and community representatives leads to the low
effectiveness of school programs introduced by the Ministry of Education, which is
important in reducing the incidence of violence, gangsterism, vandalism, and misconducts.
2.2 Strategic Planning
Strategic planning involves approaches, devices, beliefs, and mindsets for scientific inquiry,
consultancy, and policy practice. Strategic planning is used as a good entrepreneurial
reminder focused on satisfying clients (Placet and Branch, 2002). Therefore, this should also
be the primary focus of public services (Sumpor and Dokic, 2012)
Strategic planning is important in public and private institutions because it establishes
practice protocols with the aim of achieving business goals. Moreover, strategic planning is a
dynamic, universal, participatory, and collective process used to identify the goals, strategies,
and practices of institutions. The process starts with the recognition of barriers in institutions.
Instruction for practices are then established for all units to follow to achieve institutional
goals (Silva and Neto, 2014). The interdisciplinary approach in the strategic planning process
is associated with the sustainable development discourse that clarify the negative and positive
effects of certain policies and practices toward other development phases (Sumpor and
Dokic, 2013). A previous study also found the lack of efficiency in the strategic plan of the
Royal Malaysian Custom (RMC), which results in inconsistencies of RMC practice compared
with international practices (Muzainah and Mahamad, 2012)
2.3 Risk Management
Risk management is crucial for good governance because the governance framework includes
strategic and operational decision making, with the latter depending mostly on the knowledge
and understanding of businesses and access to compulsory information via electronic or by
other means (Barret, 2007). Good governance guarantees the execution of ethical values,
codes, roles, and responsibilities under a clear risk management framework with a welldefined set of accountabilities.
Furthermore, an effective risk management system helps organizations achieve business
objectives while improving financial reporting and maintaining reputation (Subramaniam,
McManus, and Zhang, 2009). Audit committees focus on the challenge of a comprehensive
risk profile and context, whereas internal audit emphasizes on the implementation of effective
risk management and on the preservation of objectivity and consistency with its formation.
Thus, the effectiveness of risk management is closely related to the integrity and ethical
standards of the senior management. Understanding the principles of the organization and
applying a formal risk management strategy into strategic decision making is important. Risk
management can be an organization‟s competitive advantage in improving strategic thinking
and ethical standards, allowing corporate governance to develop beyond the traditional
ground of corporate philanthropy (Demidenko and McNutt, 2010).
2.4 Audit
Auditors are a major part of an organization‟s monitoring system and comprise one of the
important factors of corporate governance. Therefore, auditors have to work together with
other actors in corporate governance to ensure the generation of high-quality financial reports
to stakeholders, while protecting the interests of existing and potential future shareholders
and investors (Arnold, 2002).
5

Alleyne and Howard (2004) found that organizations with good internal control, auditors, and
strong audit committee can cope comprehensively with fraud at any practice. Okpala (2012)
revealed that though external auditors have strong positions in an organization, the internal
audit committee has an important role in corporate governance. Moreover, results also
identified a relationship between audit committee practices and the integrity of financial
statements. This relationship strengthens the quality of corporate governance and avoids
corporate failure.
According to Ghonkrokta and Lather (2007), social audit is a significant social performance
assessment to determine the needs of the society. Boyd (2005) added that social audit is a
method of determining the degree to which an institution lives up to its beliefs and objectives.
Thus, different organizations and governments have shown interest in implementing social
audit to ensure commitment to good governance and sustainable development (Ghonkrokta
and Lather, 2007).
2.5 Fraud Control
Martinov–Bennie (2007) defined institutional fraud as the intentional practice involving
dishonest actions to gain an unjust or illegal benefit. Usually, the effect of a less effective
internal control environment has allowed managements to perform such frauds. As cited by
Donker and Zahir (2008), recent corporate scandals are mostly plagued by fraud. New
regulations and recommendations for corporate governance codes have been introduced with
the intention of mitigating fraud cases and future lawsuit cases in the future. Well-governed
organizations are less accountable to fraud and lawsuit cases. The International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC) has also suggested that organizations must have an independent audit
committee that functions independently from the management, has good financial experience,
meets frequently, and evaluates the integrity of financial reports. Martinov–Bennie (2007)
stated that control environments involving governance and management roles are accountable
for prevention and detection of fraud and error.
2.6 Quality Performance
Hifzainam (2014) noted that good corporate governance promotes the maintenance of
economic development by increasing the performance of companies and enhancing access to
external capital from investors and financial institutions. In China and India, for example,
good corporate governance supports a number of objectives for developing public policies.
Good corporate governance also mitigates exposure to financial crises in countries, promotes
property rights, reduces transaction cost and cost of capital, and leads to the development of a
capital market. Peda, Argento, and Grossi (2013) showed that the formation and use of the
governance devices act are important in determining the trade-off between financial and nonfinancial performance of organizations and of mixed public–private ownership.
Coleman and Osei (2008) postulated that governance is important in determining the
performance of MFIs and that the independence of the board and the difference in the
position of the CEO and the board chairperson has a positive relationship with performance
measures. In addition, governance mechanisms are positively associated with organizational
performance (Louizi, 2006).
2.7 Financial Resourcing
Companies consist of resources such as financial, physical, human, and organizational
resources (Barney, 1991; Colombo and Piva, 2008; Jones and Jayawarna, 2010). These
6

resources are improved by linking entrepreneurial endowments, such as funds, experience,
time, and contacts, with outside resources obtained as the business becomes recognized
(Brush, Manolova and Edelman 2008). Meanwhile, tangible resources, such as property
plant and equipment, and intangible resources have also become important to the
establishment of new business (Lichtenstein and Brush., 2001).
Thus, Martin, Linda, Joyce, and Max (2007) suggested that a well-planned, thoughtful
strategy will help ensure the successful implementation of financial control, while a powerful
fraud fighting mechanism is provided for the organization.
2.8 Human Resource Management
Siddiquee (2006) noted that governance can be considered a tool for improving public
administration drafting laws and policies, preparing good quality service delivery, and
strengthening partnerships by implementing the Human Capital program. In other words,
good governance encompasses the advancement of management in all social aspects. The
implementation of good governance principles is important to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of public administration.
Lin, Lee, and Tai (2012) stated that human resource approaches contribute substantial and
positive effects on market access capabilities, integrity-associated competencies, and
functionality-associated competencies. Nazlina (2011) mentioned that SMEs should focus on
HRM practices to facilitate the achievement of organizational goals, improve integrity, and
generate innovations.
2.9 Infrastructure and Facilities
A fundamental part of infrastructure encourages the standardization of services,
improvement, and interoperability (Landsbergen and Wolken, 2001), which improve control,
operation, and reduce maintenance expenses (Kaplan, 2005). E-government is also enhanced
(Janssen et al., 2009). Regardless of ownership, good governance plays a major role in
infrastructural development (Akanbi, 2013). The significance of good governance was
emphasized in the World Development Report on infrastructure, which described a variety of
issues, including both public and private roles of laws and regulations and the management of
state-owned enterprises.
3. Methodology
3.1 Sampling and Data Collection
Data for the study were collected based on a representative survey from the 682 departments
and agencies under 24 federal ministries, including the Prime Minister Department in
Malaysia. The rate of response of the targeted group to the actual sample was 16%. A total of
109 respondents from 682 target persons replied to the email questionnaire. Previous studies
had their rate of responses at 5% to 10% (Alreck & Settle, 1995). A questionnaire was
distributed by email and using the Google Doc application to department heads, with
assurance of information confidentiality. The email addresses of the respondents were
collected from the website of their respective ministries. To ensure high successful response
rates, follow up email reminders were sent, as suggested by previous studies (Fan & Yan,
2010; Kaplowitz, Hadlock, & Levine, 2004).
3.2 Measurements of Variables

7

Nine factors were used to measure good governance practices, with each factor having
several assessment parameters. The list of the items/parameters is given below. Variables
were adopted, with some modifications, from the Corporate Integrity Assessment

3.3 Analysis of Data
Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and path modeling. Descriptive statistics detailed
the general features of the data. Path modeling showed the intensity of the effect of individual
factors on the overall measurement of good governance. For the data analysis, we used Excel,
SPSS, and Smart PLS software.
For path modeling, we implemented a nonparametric bootstrap procedure to test the
significance of coefficients. The PLS path modeling method is advantageous for non-normal
data, small sample sizes, formative indicators, complex models, and other common modeling
conditions that present challenges for covariance-based methods. Variance-based structural
equation modeling can be regarded as a multivariate extension of the ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression. The iterative algorithm conducted in PLS consists of a series of OLS
analyses (Chin, 1998).
The PLS path modeling methodology includes reflective and formative computations based
on the measurement of latent variables. Formative measurement models are used when an
explanatory combination of indicator variables underlies the latent construct. These models
can best be used when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa
(Diamantopoulos 2006; Petter et al. 2007). In a formative measurement model, indicators
represent the (potentially) independent causes of the latent construct and thus do not
necessarily have high correlation. Furthermore, formative indicators are assumed to be error-

9

free (Edwards and Bagozzi, 2000). The present study followed the formative measurement
model while the path modeling is developed.
The validity of data was tested by checking the normality of data through Skewness and
Kurtosis tests, and the reliability of the data and path modeling was tested through internal
consistency reliability, indicator reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity
tests.
4. Findings and Discussions
4.1Descriptive Analysis
The present study measured good governance practices in the public sector using 40
indicators under 9 variables. Approximately 75% of the total respondents agreed that they
practiced different good governance factors except for fraud control, which was agreed upon
by 66% of the respondents (Table 1). Among different good governance practice factors,
81% practiced risk management, which was the highest. However, based on the intensity
level of practice of each variable, the highest mean score was found in the audit and financial
resourcing, and lowest score was found in the fraud control variable.

The highest mean score was 5.45 for audit and financial resourcing factors, and the lowest
mean score was 5.07 for fraud control (Table 1). The overall average score for the highest
and lowest means is at 5.23, which indicates on an average the respondents are between
„somewhat agree‟ and „agree‟.
4.2 Path Modeling Analysis
Path modeling showed that all factors are significant to the measurement of good governance
practices in the public sector (Table 2). The path coefficients indicated a 100-point change
from the strategic alliance (SA), and strategic planning (SP) practices will contribute to a
point change of 7.8 to 8.5 in the overall good governance practice system (Figure 1). Based
on the factors of audit practices (AU), risk management (RM), and quality performance (QP),
the changes on the overall good governance practice system are from 11.9 to 13.6 points. The
100-point change in fraud control (FC), human resource management (HRM), and
infrastructure and facilities (IF) has brought a change of 14.5 to 15.2 points on the overall
good governance practice system. The financial resourcing (FR) factor has the highest effect
on the overall the good governance practice system, at 16.4 points for the 100 points change.

4.3 Diagnostic Test
4.3.1 Normality Test
We used skewness and kurtosis to test the assumption of normal distribution. To assume that
the data were normally distributed, skewness was set within the range of +1 and -1, and the
Kurtosis value was set from +3 to -3 or from +2 to -2 (Field, 2009). Results showed the value
of skewness for all variables in the range of +2 to -2, and the value of Kurtosis was between
+3 and -3, except for the risk management variable. Therefore, the data were assumed to be
normally distributed.
4.3.2 Reliability Test
Internal Consistency Reliability: Internal consistency reliability was observed between all
constructs, with the composite reliability of more than 0.7 for all constructs (Table 3).

Convergent Validity: Average Variance Extracted (AVE) of more than 0.5 for all of the
constructs indicates convergent validity between all the constructs (Table 3).
Discriminant Validity: Comparison between the cross loading and outer loading in Table 7
indicates that the loading of indicators using their own construct is higher than other
constructs having cross loadings. The results reflect discriminant validity between all the
constructs based on the cross loading criterion.

Indicator Reliability: The model exhibits indicator reliability, with outer loadings of all
indicators as higher than 0.7 (Table 4). The t-stat for all the indicators was significant at 1%,
indicating that all indicators are appropriate for measuring good governance practices in the
public sector of Malaysia.
5. Conclusions and Recommendations
Malaysia aims to achieve Vision 2020 to become a developed nation. However, many steps
should be taken to improve the good governance system of the public sector and then to
achieve the previously mentioned program. This study measured the status of current good
governance practices in the public sector by assessing nine factors. Among these factors, risk
management is practiced by the most number of people, whereas only a few implemented
fraud control. Based on the intensity level of the practices of each variable, the highest mean
score was found for the audit and financial resourcing variables, whereas and lowest score
was found in the fraud control variable. Among the service groups, the engineer group was
the highest in the practice of good governance, whereas the health service group
demonstrated the lowest level. Based on the structural equation model, we found that all nine
factors were significant in the measurement good governance practices in the public sector.
In conclusion, fraud control is least practiced in the public sector of Malaysia. Thus, the level
of corruption in Malaysia remains high, with most strategies and current campaigns having
no significant effects in containing and fighting corruption (Siddiquee, 2009). The Asia
Pacific Fraud Survey Report Series 2013 reported that Malaysia, together with China, has the
highest level of bribery and corruption cases. Another survey by the Transparency
International on Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2013 showed that Malaysia has
increased by one slot in the rankings, that is, from 54 to 53 out of 177 countries with a score
of 50, but the people remained to have the average range of perception, indicating that graftfighting measures efforts are still inadequate (The Sunday Daily, 2013). Despite government
efforts to restore public confidence, more steps must be taken to improve public perception
toward public sector accountability.
Simply changing the structure of bureaucracies is not enough to improve the previously
described situation. The public sector must be transformed into a reliable and efficient sector
by ensuring good governance and implementing a proper assessment system. Enhancement of
good governance practices can help achieve the aspirations of stakeholders and ensure
accountability of the public sector. Departments and ministries should also exhibit ethics and
integrity in activities they organize to cultivate good governance. To educate the public on
the significant step taken by the government to reduce misconducts among employees,
reports should be made available to the public.
Our findings will help different government agencies and departments to improve their
governance system based on relevant service schemes. Factors and techniques for measuring

13

good governance in this study may also help the government in developing internal efficiency
measurement techniques for the public sector.
