Abstract
The present study is intended to critically examine metadiscourse markers in 24 master
thesis abstracts. Twelve of them are written by non-native Iraqi female students and the
rest by native American female students. To do so, the researchers have set two aims:
examining the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in terms of nativity and major
and comparing the usages of metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes in terms of
nativity. To achieve the present aims, Hyland’s model (2005) is adopted. It aids in
classifying the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in both data. The findings
show that the Iraqi and American researchers use the interactive resources more than the
interactional ones but the American researchers are capable of engaging their readers since
their use of the interactional markers is higher than their counterparts. The field has no
effect on the use of metadiscourse markers. There is diversity in the usage of the interactive
resources in Iraqi data. Accordingly, the researchers recommend metadiscourse markers to
be added to M.A courses as part of abstract writing exercise and the instructors of fourthyear college students to include metadiscourse markers in the writing of their research
papers for coherence and clarity.

Metadiscourse Markers in Master Thesis Abstracts

Hussein, Khalil & Abbas

1. Introduction
Harris (1959) is the first scholar to coin the term ‘metadiscourse’ which was new to discourse
analysis. Hyland (2005) states that “[m]etadiscourse is a widely used term in current discourse
analysis and language education, referring to an interesting, and relatively new, approach to
conceptualising interactions between text producers and their texts and between text producers
and users” (p.1).
Metadiscourse markers consist of two types: verbal and non-verbal. The first kind is
concerned with words (Hornby, 2010), which is the main concern of the current study. It
involves using words as markers. The second kind, non-verbal, does not involve “words or
speech” (ibid., p.1037). It refers to different types of “visual metadiscourse markers” (Kumpf,
2000, p.401; Saadi and Roosta, 2014, p.299), which are used in writing such as the font size,
the type of font …etc. or used in speech as indicated by Craig (2008) such as: intonation, stress,
voice quality…etc.
The term ‘metadiscourse markers’ is developed by a number of linguists such as Vande Kopple
(1985); Crismore, Markknen and Steffensen (1993); who provide more classifications of the
term by dividing it into major and minor types. However, the classification includes many
overlaps in its subtypes because of the few categories they offer.
Hyland (2005) makes use of the previous models in generating his own. There are no
gaps or overlaps in his model, as the previous ones, because it consists of ten subcategories.
The subtypes of this model do not have overlaps in regard to the functions of metadiscourse
markers. Zarei and Mansoori (2011) indicated that Hyland’s model is designed specifically for
academic writing. For these reasons, the researchers of this study have chosen it.
2. What are Metadiscourse Markers
Different linguists offer various definitions of the term. Crismore et al. (1993) define
metadiscourse markers as “a linguistic material in texts, written or spoken, which does not add
anything to the propositional content, but that is intended to help the listener or reader organize,
interpret, and evaluate the information given” (p.40).
The researchers do not totally agree with this belief because if one says that
metadiscourse markers do not add anything to the propositional content of the text, then this
means that their existence is optional but they are not. One can say they add a very slight
meaning that can direct and engage both the reader and the writer in a text.
Crismore (1983 ) presents metadiscourse markers as “the author's intrusion into the
discourse, either explicitly or non-explicitly, to direct the reader rather than inform” ( p. 2). She
neglects that the writer while writing should take into consideration the readers’ requirements.
The readers, in her definition, are viewed as the ones who just read what has been written. Such
markers have not only the function of directing and organising. Their main role is represented
by engaging writers and readers in a text.
Hempel and Degand (2008) elaborate that metadiscourse “concerns the understanding
of the ideational meaning and serves to organize the discourse by structuring the propositional

content, by introducing sequences or by referring to the source of the propositional material”
(p.679). In their definition, they partly define metadiscourse markers because they are
concerned with just how metadiscourse markers are used to organise a text and this can be
achieved by using the interactive markers only.
For Craig (2008), “meta-discourse ranges along a continuum from the relatively blatant
verbal framing moves . . . to relatively unconscious cues (such as a slightly noticeable word
choice, vocal emphasis, or facial expression) in which meta-discourse may be hardly
distinguishable from first-level discourse” (p.3108).
In the above definition, Craig includes the two types of metadiscourse markers that are the
verbal and non-verbal markers.
3. Taxonomies
There are several taxonomies emerge with the aim to classify metadiscourse markers, most of
them start from Halliday’s notion (1973) of language who point out that when a person uses a
language s/he is going to achieve three functions: the ideational function which refers to the
information that one has; the textual function which makes plain the way a certain person is
going to organize her/his proposition; and the interpersonal function which shows the
interaction that will take place between the producer and the audience through the
understanding of what is being said or written.
Some linguists depend on the last two functions in their classification of metadiscourse
markers since such markers play a role in organizing the text and engaging the audience. For
example, Williams (1981) categorizes them into three groups: hedges and emphatics;
sequencers and topicalizers; and attributors and narrators. The first class shows certainty and
uncertainty which can be regarded as interpersonal function according to Halliday. The second
class of markers helps in directing the readers, while the third class, which tells readers about
the source of the information is known as the ‘textual function’ according to Hallidayan
taxanomy.
Vande Kopple (1985), who adopts Hallidayan terms totally, categorizes metadiscourse
markers into two major types: textual and interpersonal. The subtypes under textual are text
connectives, code glosses, illocution markers, and narrators while the interpersonal comprise
validity markers, attitude markers, and commentaries. So this taxonomy is more developed
than that of William’s but still one can find many overlaps in its subtypes because of its limited
sorts.
While Crismore et al. (1993) adopt the same major types of Vande Kopple (1985) but
they adapt the subtypes either by adding or deleting classes. They further divide the textual
into textual and interpretive in order to separate the organization function (textual) from
evaluative function (interpretive) which helps readers to understand the writer’s point of view
by offering a further explanation and clarification. So, both of them are used in organizing the
text in order to be coherent for the audience. Hyland (2005) argues that there is no need for
such a division and merges them under one term which is ‘textual’. Crismore et al. (1993)

include the subtypes: logical connective, sequencers, reminders, topicalizers under textual and
the subtypes: code glosses, illucation markers, announcements under the interpretive. While
under the major type, interpersonal, comes hedges, certainty markers, attributors, attitude
markers, and commentary.
Thompson and Thetela (1995) and Thompson (2001), have influenced the way Hyland
shapes his model in 2005. Both of these models are concerned with the major types of
metadiscourse markers. The first one, Thompson and Thetela (1995), use the term writer-intext to denote the textual resources and reader-in-text for interpersonal resources. By writerin-text, they mean the interaction between the writer and the information that s/he is organizing.
While the second term, reader-in-text, they indicate that the writer should take into
consideration her/his imagined readers while organizing her/his text. Both of these terms work
together and are separated only for the sake of clarity in this paragraph. Thompson (2001)
classifies the major categories into interactive markers (textual) and interactional markers
(interpersonal) which are later included in Hyland’s model (2005).
4-Hyland’s model (2005)
The researchers of the present study have adopted Hyland's model (2005). The reason behind
this is that this model is designed specifically for academic writing as stated by Zarei and
Mansoori (2011) when they describe it as “a model of metadiscourse in academic texts” (p.45).
In addition to this, the model includes previous models as stated by Hyland (2005). This means
that it overcomes the gaps and overlaps in them. The following table clarifies Hyland’s model
with all its major and minor types.

5- Data collection and Analysis
The researchers have selected 24 abstracts divided into 12 abstracts written by non-native Iraqi
female students and the other 12 abstracts written by native American female students. The
twelve abstracts likewise were divided into six abstracts taken from the linguistic field
(representing different genres, namely, pragmatics and semantics ) and six abstracts from the
literature field (also representing different genres, namely, poetry and novel). The abstracts in
each discipline are selected in an arbitrary way but with a focus on years only to ensure the
fairness of the comparison between native and non-native data for which the researchers did
the same. The scope of the years was from 2005 till 2015. The researchers restrict themselves
with this scope because writing changes over time. This means new forms of metadiscourse
markers may start to be employed, specifically when one knows that metadiscourse markers
are an open category.
5.1. The Analysis
The researchers classify and discuss metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes in terms of
nativity and major. The researchers start with the literary and linguistic fields of Iraqi data then
with the American ones. The study shows the frequency of occurrence of metadiscourse
markers’ subtypes in each field by counting them manually. Their percentage is calculated
according to the following equation:
The score number of the sub-type
______________________________ X 100
The total number of the major type
After that, the study lists and pinpoints the similarities and the differences in the use of
metadiscourse markers’ types, subtypes and sub-subtypes in terms of nativity. The researchers
manually count the markers and put the numbers which show the frequency of their use
between two parentheses immediately after the marker.
The following table (5.1) classifies the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers
used in the linguistic and literary Iraqi data:

The above table shows that the Iraqi students use interactive markers more than interactional
ones in the linguistic field. They exploit all of the interactive resources’ sub-types. More
specifically, they frequently use transitions and frame markers, then come the other subcategories: endophorics, code glosses and evidentials. Iraqi researchers use only two sub-types
of the major type, interactional markers; they have low frequencies as the table above indicates.
In the literary field, the Iraqi students employ all the sub-types of interactive and interactional
resources as the table above shows.
The following table (5.2) categorizes the types and subtypes metadiscourse markers as used in the
linguistic and literary field of American data:

The native American students, in the linguistic field, use three subtypes of interactive markers
which are transitions, frame markers and code glosses. They employ four subcategories of
interactional ones, namely, hedges, boosters, self mentions and attitude markers. The literary
field indicates that the native American students frequently exploit transitions, frame markers,
code glosses and evidentials of the interactive markers. They use only three subtypes of
interactional resources, namely, engagement markers, hedges and self mentions.
The following tables list the points of the similarities and the differences in the use of types
and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in terms of nativity:

In the above table, both of the Iraqi and native American students use ‘and’ with high
frequency. This is due to the importance of that marker in organizing, stating and creating
semantic and syntactic connections. There are certain markers, as the table shows, which are
exploited by Iraqi students only. This result can be attributed to the desire of Iraqi students to
be tautologies. They divide their abstracts into more than one paragraph unlike the native
American who are in most of the cases write their abstract as one paragraph.
The native American students use only two markers from consequent and causative
markers while their counterparts, in addition to these markers, employ other markers as the
table indicates. Iraqi students in their abstract try to direct and guide their readers to extra details
about their theses. The native American in many cases gives just headlines about what their
theses will be about. Both use the contrastive and comparative markers with slight differences
as indicated above. The Iraqi and native American students tend to show the uniqueness of
their study required to compare and contrast theirs with others.

The Iraqi and native American students make use of frame markers to label stages as first or
final stage in the discussion of the aspects of their theses with slight differences. For example,
the use of ‘at this point’ in native American data and the use of ‘in this case’ in Iraqi data is to
direct their readers to a specific stage in their argument.

The Iraqi and American students also limit the boundaries of their text to certain points,
events, concepts …etc. through the use of markers such as ‘especially’, ‘only’, ‘specifically’,
but ‘today’ is used only in native American data and ‘nowadays’ and ‘now’ only in Iraqi data.
There is an overuse of the markers that show sequence, announce goals and delineate a
text in the Iraqi data. Iraqi students state the objectives and some details of their theses in
sequence which requires the use of such markers. Native American students tend to be precise
and avoid details which justify the low frequency of occurrence of these types of frame
markers.

There is diversity in the use of code glosses in Iraqi data to elaborate, expand and exemplify or
to illustrate facts in other ways. In addition to what has been used in native American data,
there are other markers such as ‘in terms of’, ‘like’, ‘for instance’ and they also use verbs to
offer further clarifications such as ‘defined’ and ‘means’ with the exception of ‘which is called’
that is used in native American data only.

A noticeable result in native American data is that there is no use of any of endophoric markers
while there are different uses of them in the Iraqi data. Iraqi students purvey in their abstract
what each chapter in their theses will be about unlike their counterparts who avoid such details
trying to increase their readers' curiosity to read more.

Evidentials are represented by mentioning the name of the scholar followed by year and

direct readers to sources such as scholars’ books outside the text to ensure the reliability of
their arguments and to direct readers for more information.

Metadiscourse Markers in Master Thesis Abstracts

Hyland (2005) states that this sub-type is used to guide readers to reliable sources other than a
text and aid a writer to support her/his argument.
This technique is used once in American data. The low frequency of the occurrence of this
marker in the American data is represented by the nature of abstracts that should be written in
most of cases with students’ words. Most of the Iraqi students do not know or follow this rule.
Table (5.8): Self-Mentions
Native
Self-mentions
My (6) , I (6)

Non-native
Self-mentions
Me (1), my (1)

The use of the possessive adjective ‘my’ and the first personal pronoun ‘I’, instead of using
words such as the ‘writer’s thesis’ or ‘the researcher’, explicitly reflect the researcher
personally. This sends a message to readers that what follows these pronouns will distinguish
the researcher’s work from that of others.
Hyland (2005) argues that self mentions refer “to the degree of explicit author presence in the
text measured by the frequency of first-person pronouns and possessive adjectives” (p.53).
The above table indicates a very low frequency in the occurrence of self-mentions in the Iraqi
data. This could be justified due to the fact that these markers are regarded as forbidden in the
Iraqi abstracts, in spite of their importance in distinguishing a researcher’s work from that of
others and creating solidarity with readers.
Table (5.9): Attitude Markers
Native
Attitude markers
Essentially (1)

Non-native
Attitude markers
Unfortunately (1)

Attitude markers are used only once in each data as in the above table. The ‘attitude markers’
are represented by ‘unfortunately’ and ‘essentially’ which for the first investigation indicates
how the writers are keen to build a relationship with readers to the extent that they show their
emotion. The researchers in their reaction towards the proposition do not only show their
attitudes but they express them from the readers’ perspective so they can experience the same
emotions. These markers are followed by logical facts which are difficult to dispute about.
This gives a reason for their low frequency.
This can be supported by Hyland (2005) also who argues that “[b]y signalling an assumption
of shared attitudes, values and reactions to material, writers both express a position and suck
readers into a conspiracy of agreement so that it can often be difficult to dispute such
judgements” (pp.149-150)
Martin and White (2005) state that when writers exploit ‘attitude markers’, they do not only
intend to show their feelings towards the proposition but also “… invite others to endorse and
to share with them the feelings, tastes or normative assessments they are announcing. Thus
declarations of attitude are dialogically directed towards aligning the addressee into a
community of shared value and belief”( p.95).

Hedges are used equally in both data with some differences in the use of markers. For
example, the native American students use ‘sort of’, ‘seemingly’, ‘possible while the Iraqi use
‘about’, ‘almost’, ‘presumably’, ‘kind of’, ‘somehow’. The other markers are found in both
data.
The existence of these markers in both data shows respect to the readers’ alternative
point of views. The researchers of both data reveal their uncertainty and release their
responsibility about what follows which will avoid forcing certain opinion on their readers.
That is why some scholars such as Mauranen (1993) argue that the use of such markers view
the writers as being polite since they take their readers’ points of view into consideration.
Sehrawat (2014) states “these markers [hedges] perform an important interpersonal function:
they allow the writer to avoid absolute statements, which makes the text more polite by giving
readers the opportunity to form their own judgments. This involves the reader more deeply in
the processing of the text” (P.380).

about through the use of boosters unlike the native students who, in most cases, release their
commitment to what they discuss. Hyland (2005) states that “[b]oosters suggest that the writer
recognizes potentially diverse positions but has chosen to narrow this diversity rather than
enlarge it, confronting alternatives with a single, confident voice”( pp.52-53)

One of the techniques to engage readers is to raise a question without answering it, leaving a
space for readers to give their own responses. It is used only once in native data and twice in
Iraqi data. The low frequency of this marker could be due to the lack of the sufficient
knowledge about its significance in engaging readers. There is no use of any other devices of
engagement markers in both data. This can be justified due to the nature of other markers. The
writer usually uses the second personal pronoun ‘you’ and the ‘imperatives’ such as ‘note’,
‘consider’, …etc. to engage her/his readers. The use of ‘you’ and ‘imperatives’ in texts other

than books and manual, where a writer has authority, can be regarded as offensive as clarified
by Kuo (1999, p.126) “you [emphasis mine] could sound offensive or detached since it
separates readers, as a different group, from the writer” and “imperatives are frequently used
in textbooks or manuals where a writer would like to sound authoritative.” “[H]owever,
imperative you would sound offensive and impair the reader–writer relationship.” (ibid, p.127)
6. Discussion of Results
The results show that the interactive resources are highly used by the Iraqi researchers
compared to the interactional ones. More specifically, in the linguistic field, transitions subtype
has been used (99) times and the frame markers subtype (40) times, then comes the other
markers. As for the interactional markers, hedges have been used (13) times and boosters only
(3) times. The other subtypes are neglected. This indicates that the Iraqi researchers are able to
organize their information more than engaging their readers.
In the American data, only 3 subcategories of interactives have been used; transitions (89)
times, frame markers (9) times and code glosses (4) times. The interactional ones are
represented by 4 subtypes that are hedges (15) times, boosters twice, attitude markers only once
and self-mentions (6) times.
Concerning the literature field in the Iraqi data, one can notice that the percentages for
interactional resources increased slightly. There is the use of hedges, boosters, attitude markers,
self-mentions and engagement markers while in the interactive ones still the transitions and the
frame markers take the first places according to the percentages then comes the other
categories. In the American literature data, the transitions and frame markers come first then
the code glosses and evidentials. Besides, one can detect that there is a reduction in the use of
the interactional resources in this field in comparison with the linguistic one. Hedges and
engagement markers are used (only once) and self-mentions (6) times.
7-Conclusion
Concerning the first objective of the study, which is about examining the types and subtypes
of metadiscourse markers in terms of nativity and major, the researchers find that the American
and Iraqi researchers’ use of interactive markers’ subtypes are nearly high in both fields. When
it comes to the interactional markers’ subtypes that are related to readers’ engagement in the
text, there are great differences between American and Iraqi data. The total number of
American researchers’ use of interactional markers in linguistics is 24 while in Iraqi data is 16.
Concerning the literature field, the American researchers use interactional markers only 8 times
while their use in the Iraqi data is 17 times. This leads to conclude that the field has no effect
on the use of metadiscourse markers. This may be proved through the rise in the percentage of
interactional markers when they are used in the Iraqi literary field more than the linguistic field,
but when it comes to the American data, the result is completely the opposite. The American
researchers use the interactional markers in the linguistic field more than the literary field. This
leads us to conclude that the use of metadiscourse markers is something that is highly related
to the producers’ understanding and their ability to employ them in a text, i.e., being nonnatives.
With regard to the second objective of the study, which is comparing the usages of
metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes in terms of nativity, the researchers find that there

is diversity in the use of metadiscourse markers’ subtypes, specially the nteractive resourses,
in the Iraqi data more than the American ones. This is due to the tendency of Iraqi researchers
to give more details about their theses. Logically, this will lead them to use more markers to
make their tautology clear. This appears clearly in the use of endophoric markers. One can
notice that these markers are used (33) times in the Iraqi data whereas there is no use of them
in the American ones. The Iraqi researchers direct their readers to what each chapter in their
theses will be about which will ultimately need the use of endophorics. Moreover, the frame
markers are used (68) times in Iraqi data while used only (16) times in the American ones. This
leads us to conclude that the American tend to be precise and avoid details in their abstracts
which will require low variety in the use of metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes.
