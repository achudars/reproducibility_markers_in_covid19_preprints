"10" "Abstract"
"11" "Husband-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) against wives is highly prevalent in rural Nepal . Social inequities  experienced by  women and girls, compounded by norms characterized by male dominance increase risk of IPV. To address this problem, the  Change Starts at Home Project   employs  a social behavior change communication strategy (SBCC) to shift behavior and norms related to IPV  in 36 Village Development Committees in three districts ( Chitwan ,  Kapilvastu ,  Nawalparasi ) in Nepal . The project is being evaluated with a  cluster randomized  trial ( NCT02942433 ).  Data  for the manuscript  come from baseline surveys  of reproductive-aged women randomly selected from the intervention and control communities (N=1440)  and  female intervention  enrollees  (N=360).  Descriptive  statistics were used to  identify  differences  across   and within  intervention arms  and among intervention enrollees and randomly selected participants from the same communities .  A total of 1982  individuals were assessed for eligibility resulting in a response rate of 72.65%. The cooperation rate was 84.16%.  Results indicate  broad  sociodemogra phic similarities  on most variables , although a higher percentage of intervention participants were unemployed and a lower percentage had love marriages compared to both study conditions.   A smaller percentage of women in the intervention communities reported physical and / or sexual IPV in the prior 12 months (23.89%) than control communities (31.81%) or intervention participants (15.00%).   Participants reported favorably to questions inquiring about  whether  their rights as participants   were upheld , however, a minority felt they could discontinue at any time  suggesting the need for greater consideration of this aspect of participation in subsequent data collection."

"13" "Introduction"
"14" "Globally, approximately 30% of women e xperience  intimate partner violence ( IPV )  in their lifetime   (World Health Organization, 2013) .   Between 26% and one third  of Nepali women  report  lifetime IPV, and over half of women  report experiencing  some  form  of violence  (e.g. child maltreatment,  sexual assault)  in their lifetime   (Dalal, Wang, & Svanström, 2014; Lamichhane, Puri, Tamang, & Dulal, 2011; Ministry of Health, New ERA, & ICF, 2017; MOHP, 2011) .   Prevalence of  IPV  in rural Nepal is estimated to be ev en higher   (Madhu Sudhan Atteraya, Shreejana Gnawali, & In Han Song, 2015) ,  with approximately 52 %  of  young married women reporting violence at the hands of their h u sbands , and approximately 36% reporting  this occu r ring  within the past 12 months   (Lamichhane et al., 2011) .   Approximately a quarter of these young married women reported physical violence and multiple  studies   in Nepal  have determined that between 46 %  and 75% of  their participants  report ed  experiencing marital sexual violence   (Lamichhane et al., 2011; Puri, Frost, Tamang, Lamichhane, & Shah, 2012; Puri, Tamang, & Shah, 2011; UNDP, 2014) ."
"15" "While there is no sole cause of IPV, risk  is heightened   from  numerous influential factors  at multiple levels .  For instance,  i ndividual factors   include   exposure to   IPV  as a child   (Ministry of Health et al., 2017; UNDP, 2014) , while partner level factor includes   husband alcohol use   (Madhu Sudhan Atteraya et al., 2015; Deuba, Mainali, Alvesson, & Karki, 2016; Ministry of Health et al., 2017; Puri et al., 2011; Sharma, 2007) , and   interpersonal dynamics, such as male-dominated decision-making   (Madhu Sudhan Atteraya et al., 2015; Lamichhane et al., 2011) .  C ommunity and societal factors, such as acceptability of violence against women   (Boyle, Georgiades, Cullen, & Racine, 2009; Yoshikawa, Shakya, Poudel, & Jimba, 2014)  are also  critical influencers . Further, the interplay between multi-level factors compounds the risk for  IPV   (Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002) ."
"16" "In Nepal  specifically, norms characterized  by  masculine dominance and female  submission  underpin  increased risk for IPV   (Clark et al., 2018; Nwokolo, Shrestha, Ferguson, Shrestha, & Clark, under review) .  Traditional Nepali practices  and societal factors, such as young er age at  marriage  and restricted access to education and employment, impose further vulnerabilities and risk for women and girls   (Madhu Sudhan Atteraya et al., 2015; Sharma, 2007) .   Husbands  often endorse traditional gender roles ,  and their opinions  generally   hold more   weight   in  marital decision-making   (Madhu Sudhan Atteraya et al., 2015; Lamichhane et al., 2011; UNDP, 2014) .  Additionally, acceptability of partner violence  is  high in Nepal   (Ministry of Health et al., 2017; UNDP, 2014) ."
"17" "To address these issues, the  Change Starts at Home Project   uses a social  behavior change communication strategy   (SBCC)  to  shift  norms and associated behaviors with the ultimate aim of preventing IPV perpetration among married couples in Nepal.  The intervention  is being evaluated   through  a mixed methods 2-armed randomized trial comparing an  SBCC strategy to radio programming alone for its impact on physical and / or sexual IPV at 12 and 24 months ’  post-baseline.  T he purpose of this  manuscript  is t o describe in detail  the  recruitment, enrollment, and baseline characteristics of participants in the  Change Starts at Home Project ."
"18" "Methods"
"19" "Overview"
"20" "The trial  was designed to be mixed  methods involving the collection of quantitative and qualitative measures over the course of the study. Quantitative measures include surveys with female participants conducted at baseline (March/April 2016, midline (March/April 2017) and end line ( July/August 2018 ). These surveys  assessed  demographics, knowledge and attitudes,  experience of IPV, marital dynamics and family norms. Qualitative measures  (not reported in the current manuscript)  included individual in-depth interviews with listening and discussion group (LDG) participants (N=18 couples; 36 individuals) at baseline, midline and end line. In addition, one set of interviews took place halfway through the intervention. The in-depth interviews investigated individual knowledge and attitudes, marital dynamics and family and community norms, as well as change within these areas over time. Focus groups discussions  were held  with family members and community members, separately, at baseline and will be repeated at end line to identify changes in family-based norms, as well as any impact of project-related activities. This present manuscript  is focused  on baseline  quantitative  data from the participants in the community-based sample. Detailed information about the trial design has been published elsewhere  (Clark et al., 2017) .  The conduct of the trial has been approved by institutional review boards of key investigators and the Nepal Health Research Council . Further approval from the District Development Committees  was obtained  for each district and all participants provided written informed consent."
"21" "Intervention"
"22" "Change  is a multi-component SBCC strategy designed to shift attitudes, norms and  behavio rs that underpin the power imbalances that disfavor women and increase women’s vulnerability to husbands’ IPV within couples in Nepal. Recognizing the social ecology of change, the intervention  (designed and implemented by Equal Access International)  engages actors across multiple domains of influence, such as family members and community leaders, in addition to the primary target audience of married reproductive age women and their husbands. As a SBCC strategy, the intervention approaches IPV prevention through three key approaches: advocacy, social mobilization and  behavio r change communication   (C-Change, 2012) .  The  behavio r change communication component is a  9-month, weekly radio drama with listener engagement through interactive voice response (IVR) and short message service (SMS), to which both the intervention and control conditions are exposed. The intervention communities are further engaged in radio  Listening and Discussion Groups (LDGs), through which the  married  male and female participants  meet  to critically reflect  on the content of the radio episode through a curriculum-based process of guided discussion, in-group and home-based activities. LDGs serve as venues for life skills building and act as a platform through which community outreach activities  are planned and executed, alongside local leaders who receive training and support to act as advocates in the community for more equitable social norms . The use of multiple modalities is in keeping with current best practices in social norms change  (Paluck & Ball, 2010)  which recognizes that modifying complex phenomena (such as social norms) requires a multi-faceted approach."
"23" "The  Change  communication and mobilization intervention relies on a number of theoretical models including: the Socio-Ecological Model   (C-Change, 2012)  ( conceptualize s  the multiple contexts and factors that influence beh avio r change );  the Steps to  Behavio r Change Framework   (Piotrow, Kincaid, Rimon II, & Ward, 1997)  and  the Integrative Model of  Behavio r Prediction   (Yzer, 2012)   ( anchor s  project activities and curriculum to particular stages and entry points toward  behavio r change ) , and the Diffusion of Innovations theory   (Rogers, 2003)   ( guide s  efforts to extend the impact of the intervention beyond those most directly exposed ) .  Collectively, the theoretical underpinning of the project recognizes that change is a process, although not necessarily  a  linear  process , that occurs within embedded contexts of interpersonal, social and political contexts. The intervention  is divided  into 3 phases, each lasting 3 months and each delivered via the radio program and the curriculum-based weekly LDG sessions."
"24" "Sample"
"25" "Twelve  village development committees (VDC) per district ( total of 36  clusters) were selected where it was feasible to carry out project activities, keeping in mind geographic location to reduce likelihood of contamination.  Using publicly available data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, each VDC was pair-matched based on factors including female literacy rates, caste and primary language. W ithin the VDC, two wards were randomly selected using probability proportionate to size methodology among eligible wards. Eligible wards  were defined  as havi ng a total household population  between 100 and 550, a size assumed appropriate for project activities. Within each ward, a VDRC representative visit ed ward subdivisions  that  compris ed  15-20 households to compile a list of households and identify those containing eligible couples .  To support this work, the local partner representative drew on information from key informants  (e.g. female village health workers) and existing lists and documents, where available . These household lists  were aggregated  at the ward level to create the project’s sampling frame. Households were eligible if they included a  married  woman between 18 and 49 years of age, who  resided most of the year with their husband (18 years and above) . Couples  were rendered  ineligible if they did not speak Nepali, had a physical or cognitive impairment or were planning to relocate within 2 years. Using the sampling frame, simple random sampling was used to select 40 women from each VDC, comprising 20 from each ward for the community-based survey (N=1440). Ten couples were also selected for the weekly LGD sessions with an emphasis on individuals who lived nearby the likely site of the LDG group, met the eligibility criteria, and were willing to commit to weekly participation for 9 months (N=360 couples)."
"26" "Measures"
"27" "Socio-demographic  and health  variables assessed included age at marriage i n years, type of marriage ( l ove marriage with and without parental blessing and arranged marriage with and  without participant’s blessing ),  and  the participants and their husband’s educational levels ( categorized as none, primary, some secondary, and S chool  Leaving Certificate) . Survey respondents  were also asked  if they and their husbands had earned money for work or trade during the past  12   months and whether they or their husband frequently  felt  stressed because of not having enough income (dichotomous).  Taking into account previous research in Nepal which found lower caste and religious minority status to be associated with a higher risk of IPV,  Caste   /   ethnicity was  categorized into  upper caste  and  relatively advantaged  Janajatis , disadvantaged non-Dalit and  Janajatis , and Dalit and re li gious minorities  as  (M. S. Atteraya, S. Gnawali, & I. H. Song, 2015) .   Depressive symptoms were assessed wi th  the PHQ- 8  which has been validated in Nepal   (Kohrt, Luitel, Acharya, & Jordans, 2016; Kroenke et al., 2009) .  Higher scores indicated greater depressive symptomatology. The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.8 8 .  Disability status w as assessed with five  items of the Washington Group on Disability Statistics’ (Washington Group on Disability Statistics, 2017)  Short Set six -item scale.  Respondents   were asked  if they had no difficulty, some  difficulty, a lot of difficulty  or cannot do at all ,  the following: see, even if wearing glasses; hear; walk or climb steps; remember or concentrate; and speak.  Using the recommended scoring function for the Washington Group, a respondent was considered disabled if she reported ,  to any of the tasks ,  a lot of difficulty or an inability to do the task at all   (Washington Group in Disability Statistics, 2017) .   Cronbach’ s alpha for this scale was 0.42."
"28" "G ender  equitable attitudes were measured with 1 0 items derived from the Gender- Equitable Men scale   (Pulerwitz & Barker, 2008) .  A score  was calculated  as the mean across the items, with a higher s core representing more gender  equitable attitudes. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.83.  Agency was measured from two complementary perspectives, control and  effective power   (Alkire, 2008) .  Control was assessed as d ecision-making  agency   (Alkire, 2008) , one of the most frequently assessed forms of agency  (Alkire, 2008; Kabeer, 1999) , including in Nepal  (Acharya, Bell, Simkhada, van Teijlingen, & Regmi, 2010) . The measure included three items  from the UN Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence  (Fulu, 2013)   covering  who has the final say in decisions  related to  the health of women in the family  and  how the family sp ends money on food and clothing  and large investments. Response options included mostly the respondent’s husband (1), mostly the respondent (2), the respondent and her husband equally (3), and someone else (4). If a respondent indicated responded  2  or 3, she was considered to have participated in that decision. A  household  decision- making score  was calculated  as a count across the three items with higher scores indicating greater participation in h ousehold decision- making.  As the intervention  was developed  to prevent physical and sexual IPV, o ne add itional item was develo ped for the study to measure  respondent’s say in whether or not to  engage in  sexual relations with her husband  in the same format as the other decision-making variables . Response options to this item included mostly the husband (1), mostly the respondent (2), or both equally (3). Similar to the above item, if the respondent reported either  2  or 3, she was considered to have participated in decisions regarding sexual activity.  A measure of effective power  was developed  for this study comprising three items measuring how much say the respondent had in decisions that affect her, her ability to say no to her husband when he asked her to do something unreasonable, and how much control she had over her personal safety in the home. While these are only a few facets of a much broader concept   (Alkire, 2008) , the three chosen were considered to be core elements impacted by IPV. Respondents were presented with a ladder , which  is a visual aid that  has been used in prior measures of  empowerment  (Narayan, 2005)  to provide a visual representation of each item’s rating scale . The ladder was presented for  each of the  3  items and contained  five rungs ,  the top being the most  effective power , the bottom rung being the least. A mean across the three items  was calculated  with higher scores representing greater agency. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.83."
"29" "The frequency of communication between the respondent and her husband in the prior week (never, once, few, many times) was assessed with items from the World Health Organization’ Multi-Country Study on Health and Domestic V iolence Against Women (WHO MCS)  (World Health Organization, 2005) .  Topics assessed included “things that happened to him during the day”, “things that happened to you during the day,” “his worries or feelings,” and “your worries or feelings.” The score  was calculated  as the mean across the items. The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0. 90 . The frequency of quarreling (never, sometimes, often) and husband’s inebriation ( never, once a month or less, at least weekly ) were assessed with one item each from the WHO MCS   (World Health Organization, 2005)  and modeled continuously.   Conflict re solution was assessed with   items adapted from the Relationship Self Efficacy Beliefs' Scale   (Lopez, Morua, & Rice, 2007)  inquiring about the ease at which the respondent and her husband work out every day problems together and talk openly and directly about a topic on which they disagree. Response options to both were not easily at all (0), somewhat easily (1) and very easily (2). An average across the two items represented great er  capacity to resolve conflicts."
"30" "Physical and / or sexual  IPV  in prior 12 months was measured with the standard items employed through the What Works to Prevent Violence Global Program   (What Works to Prevent Violence Global Program, 2015) .  Items assessed the frequency of occurrence (never, once, few, many) of five items measuring physical IPV and three items measuring sexual IPV. Reported occurrence of any item in the prior 12 months constituted exposure to IPV.  Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was 0. 90 . The measure  was modeled  dichotomously as exposure to any of the physical  or sexual IPV experiences in past 12 months compared to no experience in the prior 12 months.  Emotional IPV  was assessed  via the WHO MCS.  This four-item scale asked  whether the husband had insulted or made her feel bad, belittled or humiliated her in front of other people, done things to scare or intimidate her, and threatened to hurt her or someone she cares about in the past 12 months.  Cronbach’s alpha (0.85 ).  Financi al violence was assessed with three  items from United Nations Multi-country Study on Men and Violence   (Fulu, 2013)  measuring whether in the past 12 months, the respondent’s husband had prohibited her f rom getting a job, going to work , trading or earning money;   took her earnings or valuables such as  jewelry  against her will ; or kept money from his earnings for alcohol, tobacco or other things for himself when it was    hard to afford household expenses.  A positive response to any of these items consisted financial violence."
"31" "The measure of in-law violence was devel oped for this study but  based on research in South Asia, including Nepal, highlighting the role of in-laws in women’s risk of IPV   (Samuels, Jones, & Gupta, 2017)  and prior research measuring in-law violence   (Clark, Silverman, Shahrouri, Everson-Rose, & Groce, 2010) .  The participant was considered to have experienced violence by an in-law if she responded affirmatively to items assessing emotional (called names, insulted, humiliated or prevented from leaving the home) or physical (hit, kicked, punched or otherwise physically hurt) abuse, or reported that her husband’s family encouraged him to hit, kick, punch, or otherwise physically hurt her. An affirmative response across the three items constituted exposure to in-law abuse, which  was modeled  dichotomously.  A measure of help - seeking was dev eloped  for the study assessing whether a  respondent who had experienced  physical and / or sexual IPV in the prior 12 months had sought help from sources ranging from friends, family, and a variety of formal and informal support sources. The variable  was dichotomized  as sought help from any source or did not seek help from any source.  F requency of exposure in the past 12 months to anti-VAWG messaging from four sources (ra dio, television, street theatre and  religious or community leader)  was assessed  with one item each. Response options included never (0), a few times (1), at least once a month (2), at least once a week (3), and daily (4). Items  were dichotomized . Finally, r esearch ethics and participant  reaction to the  study  was assessed with  six  items from the Reactions to Research Participation Scale   (Newman, Willard, Sinclair, & Kaloupek, 2001)  assessing: voluntary participation, ability to stop participating, emotional reaction, meaningfulness of participation to self and others, willingness to participate again knowing how the experience would be. Items  were measured  dichotomously."
"32" "Analytic strategy"
"33" "The response and  cooperation  rates were calculated using standard definitions of the American Association for Public Opinion Research.   (The American Association for Public Opinion Research, 2016)  The response rate  was defined  as"
"34" "The cooperation rate  was defined  as     De scriptive and comparative analyses were performed to explore  the  data  by study condition .  An additional comparison was made of those who  were enrolled  in a n   LDG  to examine potential differences between LDG enrollees and the two community samples.    C ontinuous variables  were presented  as means and  standard deviations and categorical data as  frequencies and proportions.  SAS  9.4  statistical software  was used  to manage and analyze all quantitative data."
"35" "Results"
"36" "Figure 1 describes the recruitment of VDCs and individuals into the trial.  Overall,  all  of the originally purposefully selected VDCs or randomly selected wards within those VDCs participate d  as recruited. At the individual level,  1440 community-based participants  were successfully recruited  for the baseline survey.  A total of 1982  individuals were assessed for eligibility resulting in a response rate of 72.65%.  The cooperation rate was 84.16%.  The majority of those included in the “other” category were out of the study site during data collection.  Data  were not collected  on the number of potential LDG participants who were invited to participat e but ultimately chose not to."
"37" "Table 1 describes the sociodemographic and health  characteristics  of the community-based samples representing the intervention and control communities and the LDG participants.  Overall  the intervention and control communities  were  quite similar. LDG members showed more differences compared to both study conditions. A higher percent of LDG members were unemployed and fewer LDG members have had love marriages with t heir family’s blessing and exhibited  slightly fewer depressive symptoms, although symptoms were very low across all groups. Overall, the three groups were relati vely comparable given the socio cultural diversity of Nepal."
"38" "Table 2 describes the primary and secondary outcomes and ethical and safeguarding items included in the baseline questionnaire. Despite broad sociodemographic similarities in the sample,  the  difference across conditions in the primary outcome is noteworthy.  A smaller percentage of  women in the intervention communities reported physical and / or sexual IPV in the prior 12 months  (23.89%)  than control communities  (31.81%) .  Other d ifferences of note  include a higher  percentage  of women in the contr ol condition reporting decision- making around sexual relations with  their husbands  (66.48% vs. 60.69%, respectively)  and differences  in the lowest two categories of husband drunkenness across conditions, although similarity between conditions in the highest frequency category. A greater proportion of women in the control communities  were exposed  at baseline to anti-VAWG messages, especially from television.  The distribution of most other variables was broadly similar across study conditions."
"39" "Differences between  the LDG participants and the two community sam ples include a  lower percentage who reported IPV in the prior 12 months (15.00%), a  higher  percentage  who reported decision- making around sexual relations  (75.83%) , a higher  percentage  who reported that their husband was never drunk  (73.3% vs 68.47% among intervention participants vs 62.08% among control participants) ,  a smaller  percentage  who   sought help for IPV in the past 12 months  and  a smaller  percentage  had been expos ed  to anti-VAWG messages  via  street theaters and from religious or community leaders."
"40" "Table 2 also describes findings from the administration of items monitoring safety and research ethics.  Between conditions ,  fewer felt they could stop participating at any time in the control group  (6.24% vs 10.12%)  and a higher proportion reported experiencing intense emotions  (14.33% vs 9.82%) . A similar proportion of respondents in both conditions reported that their choice to participate was freely made  (>97%) , that participation meaningful to themselves and others  (>96%) , and that they would participate again knowing what the experience would be like  (>98%) . The LDG participants were similar to both conditions on all of these factors. A smaller  percentage  of LDG participants  felt they could discontinue part icipation at any time  (3.33%)  and fewer  reported experiencing intense emotions, especially compared to the control condition  (7.78% vs 14.33%) ."
"41" "Discussion"
"42" "Despite various efforts to increase rights and protection for Nepali women and girls, IPV remains  a significant concern in Nepal , particularly in  the  Terai  region .  To address this prob lem, the  Change Starts at Home P roject  engages couples to reduce and prevent IPV through a relationship skills  building  and norms-change intervention.  Among  numerous  novel aspects of this study,  to our knowledge  this is the first primary prevention trial in Nepal to address IPV."
"43" "The study’s response rate of 72.65% and cooperation rate was 84.16% are acceptable and the broad comparability of the sample across the two conditions is reas suring that comparable samples  have been recruited . This  is also   true  for  the LDGs ,  where more differences  are expected  given the additional commitment to participate  for nine months .  LDG participants, however, were not so different as to be entirely dissimilar from other groups. In fact, unless  participant dissimilarities   entirely  inhibit   comparison,  some difference may be  beneficial  as these participants serve as change agent s  within their communities.  Further, d ue to considerable sociodemographic similarities across groups, being  completely dissimilar  is unlikely."
"44" "T he prevalence of physical and / or sexual IPV  within  the  past 12 months  varied  across groups .   While significantly lower for LDG participants (15.00 % ) and somewhat lower for  women residing in  intervention  communities  (23.89 % )  compared to  control group  communities  (31.81%) , all are larger than the estimate s for the  Terai  region (13.8%) reported  in the  Demographic and Health Survey fielded the same year as our baseline assessment   (Ministry of Health et al., 2017) .   The  Change Starts at Home  estimates for emotional violence are also 3 to 4 times those of the DHS   (Ministry of Health et al., 2017) .   While prevalence estimates from violence-focused surveys compared to the more broadly maternal and child health focused DHS is expected given prior research   (Ellsberg, Heise, Pena, Agurto, & Winkvist, 2001) ,  our study’s higher prevalence estimates suggest a degree of validity along with the fact that our  study’s  findings fit within the broad range of estimates of other  Nepal-based  studies   (Madhu Sudhan Atteraya et al., 2015; Lamichhane et al., 2011; MOHP, 2011; Puri et al., 2012; Puri et al., 2011; UNDP, 2014)   and are in line wit h   the high prevalence of  male-dominant norms ."
"45" "Finally, monitoring safety and the process of adhering to ethical standards is an essential component of all ethically oriented research. Findings from this study are largely similar to research on violence and other forms of trauma that has found that while some questions may result in an emotional response, the opportunity to participate is often meani ngful, and for  some cathartic   (Clark, Shahrouri, & Halasa, 2010) .  Collectively, respondent reports about their participation confirm the lack of harm, and adherence to research participants’ rights.  However, the finding that participants did not feel free to stop participating at any time is noteworthy and requires sustained attention to ensure that voluntary participation  is matched  with an equally strong  understanding of participants’ rights to disengage at any time without penalty. This study has taken steps to reaffirm this right throughout study activities ; however in LMICs, there may be underlying inequities influenc ing  voluntariness, which warrant extra consideration   (Smith, Morrow, & Ross, 2015) .     Analysis of midline and end   line data  will be  essential to know if this shortcoming  has been rectified  and highlights the value in monitoring not just for harm, but  also  for adherence to a range of ethical principles that we as researchers commit ourselves to upholding."
"46" "Limitations"
"47" "The measures taken in this study were self-report and  therefore  may  be  influenced  by social desirability bias.  This  i s furthered  by  the highly sensitive and potentially stigmatizing nature of information participants were asked to share with researchers.   There are no publically available data at the ward-level against which to compare the sociodemographic characteristics of the samples. The broad similarity across the groups minimizes this concern and ultimately, the  study design prioritizes internal validity over external validity. Finally, the most vulnerable women were not included in this study given the need, particularly for LDG participants, to enroll with their husbands."
"48" "Conclusion"
"49" "Globally, and in Nepal specifically,  IPV remains a considerable  public health  problem  with  far  reaching health consequences .  To address this problem, the  Change Starts at Home Project   aims to  shift norms and behaviors, and ultimately prevent marital IPV through an SBCC intervention.   This paper described recruitment and enrollment  methods for the study and  analysis of  data  to determine participant characteristic at baseline.  Results suggested broad similarities across comparison groups. As anticipated, there were more differences among the LDG cohort; however,  not so  different  as to render them incomparable to the comparison groups.
