Introduction

The Human Mortality Database (HMD, 2019) is widely used for the study of mortality,
as it provides high quality, comparable demographic data for more than forty national
populations. For some of the countries included in that source, the time coverage exceeds
150 years, which (among other things) makes the HMD an excellent, easy-to-use tool for an
initial assessment of the mortality levels in historical populations.
Mortality data from the HMD have been used in numerous studies, as researchers trust its
excellent quality. While the database has certainly a high degree of reliability, it is improved
continuously, as updates are made from time to time in order to correct past estimates
and to add data for the most recent years. In this short research note, I explain one of
those inconsistencies, concerning specifically data for Denmark from 1835 to 1854: for that
period, Danish infant mortality is significantly over-estimated in the HMD, as the stillbirths
are mistakenly included among the deaths at age 01 . This issue is explained below and the
impact on other mortality measures is demonstrated. A partial solution to the problem is
proposed at the end (‘partial’ because it is conceived as a possible temporary solution, until
corrections are implemented in the HMD).
The aim of this short note is just to point to a specific data issue, which historical
researchers using the data concerned should be aware of. Despite the particularity of the case
in question, the results presented here are relevant for any study of infant mortality in the
past, as the treatment of stillbirths in historical statistics is not always clear or appropriate
in the light of demographic practise. This brief paper is intended as a positive note, not
negative criticism: as a frequent user of the HMD, I believe the continuous improvement of
this data source is of interest to the research community.

Data

For the brief descriptive analyses presented here, I use period mortality data for Denmark
from the HMD, namely the annual death counts and population exposures at age 0 (1 D0 and
1 N0 respectively), estimates of the probability of dying at age 0 (1 q0 ) and life expectancy
at birth (e0 ). The data are by sex and cover the period 1835–1950. Additionally, I use the
annual number of stillbirths (males and females combined) from 1835 to 1854, as reported
in Danmarks Statistik (1905).

Methods

The annual death counts at age 0 for Denmark from 1835 to 1854 from the HMD were
corrected by subtracting the number of stillbirths. While Danish data on the total number
of stillbirths (males and females combined) are available on a yearly basis for the period
1835–1854, counts by sex are, to my knowledge, only for 10-year periods in Danmarks
Statistik (1905). The latter volume, prepared by the national statistical office, is a summary
of key developments in the Danish population during the entire 19th century. However, as
the organization of the statistical offices and the complexity of the information collected
evolved rapidly during that century in most European countries, there are some aspects for
which detailed information is not available, especially for the earlier decades.
The decadal distributions by sex mentioned above indicate that the proportion of female
and male stillbirths remained approximately constant during the entire 19th century in
Denmark (about 43% and 57% on average, respectively for females and males). Using
this information, annual estimates on the number of stillbirths by sex were obtained by
applying the latter weights to the yearly data for males and females combined. The total
annual number of stillbirths as well as the resulting estimates by sex are reproduced in the
Appendix at the end of this document.
After subtracting the annual number of stillbirths of each sex from the death counts at
age 0 from the HMD, annual life tables for 1835–1854 were computed. From the latter, two
measures were selected in order to assess the impact of the corrections on infant mortality,
namely the probability of dying at age 0, 1 q0 (eq.1), and life expectancy at birth, e0 (eq. 2):
1 q0

=

1 m0

1 + (1 −1 a0 )1 m0

,

(1)

and
e0 = T0 /l0 .

(2)

In the above equations, 1 m0 is the central death rate at age 0, 1 a0 is the average personyears lived by the infants who died before age 1, T0 is the person-years lived above age 0
and l0 is the radix of the life table (see Preston et al. 2001).

Results

During the period 1835–1854, the total number of stillbirths in Denmark increased from
about 1730 to 2300. By including these cases in the numerator of the corresponding death
rates, infant mortality is significantly over-estimated: instead of 15 per 1000 (as indicated
in other studies, such as Johansen 2002 and Løkke 2002), the infant mortality rate based
on HMD data is about 20 per 1000. This substantial difference is represented in terms of
proportion of deaths at age 0 in Figure 1 (solid line), where the sharp, sudden decrease in
1855 is too pronounced to indicate a real trend. Correcting the death counts at age 0 as
indicated above results in a more reasonable scenario, as indicated by the dashed line in the
Figure.
Given the heavy weight of young-age mortality on life expectancy in the past, estimates
of life expectancy at birth are also considerably affected: e0 is consistently underestimated
by about 2 years during the period in question (see Figure 2). This has implications for
other kinds of demographic analyses. For instance, when age-contributions to changes in
life expectancy are estimated using the uncorrected data, the contribution of age 0 may
be over-estimated. Figure 3 shows a concrete example of this issue, where female Danish
mortality was compared at two points in time (1835 and 1885), applying a simple agedecomposition method (Arriaga, 1984). Indeed, the contribution of age 0 is exaggerated
when the uncorrected infant mortality rates are used, as it illustrates the large, unlikely
decline from the levels in 1835-1854 to those in the 1880s (jump in 1855 indicated in Figure

1). Female life expectancy at birth increased from 41.9 years in 1835 to 50.8 years in 1885
(using corrected estimates for 1835). The contribution of age 0 to that change is about 1.2
years and not 3 years, as indicated by the figure using the uncorrected data (where e0 in
1835 is 40.2).
Finally, another example of an analysis where the use of the uncorrected data has a
large impact is breakpoint analysis, where statistical methods are used in order to identify significant changes in the structure of a time-series. Torres and Oeppen (manuscript
in preparation) apply a breakpoint analysis using extended series of e0 estimates for the
Nordic countries. For Denmark, the results using the uncorrected data cause an additional
breakpoint to be estimated, which disappears when the corrected counts are used. A reasonable overview of the phases of the health transition in Denmark can be obtained when
the breakpoint analysis is applied to the accurate time-series of e0 estimates.

Conclusion

Including the number of stillbirths among the deaths at age 0 has a significant impact on
mortality measures, especially in historical populations, where infant mortality had a heavy
weight on general mortality measures such as the expectation of life at birth. An example
of those issues was presented in this brief research note using data from the HMD. In that
database, the stillbirths are mistakenly included with the death counts at age 0 for the years

are provided in the Appendix. The latter constitute a temporary solution, until corrections
are implemented in the HMD.
