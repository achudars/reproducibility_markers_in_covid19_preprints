Assessment of External Supports for Harvesting Artisanal Galda (Macrobrachium
Rosenbergii de Man) Fisheries from the Sundarbans Mangrove Ecosystem in
Bangladesh
Abstract
The study was conducted through 24 individual surveys in the SME of Bangladesh covering
16 river/canals and 32 locations (one-third area) of the Sundarbans by direct interviews of
randomly selected 1,989 fishermen from 545 non-mechanized boats and 1,428 active gears
from eight types of gear. The source of credit, agreement of Dadan, variability in prices,
profit distribution agreement between boat/gear owner and the fishing labour, catch volume,
and the relation between the fisher and the landing centers (i.e., intimacy and expected
market prices) were found to be determinant factors in determining the place for landings of
the harvested catches in the study area. There was access of fishers to the formal credit
markets (i.e. scheduled banks or cooperatives) at 13±2.83 (11-15) % interest. However, the
rate of interest offered by the NGOs was significantly higher (mean: 45±31, range: 18-76%)
than the bank rates. A number of formalities were found to inhibit fishers to receive credit
from Banks and NGOs. About 60-100% of the value of Galda catch, after covering the
operational costs, was taken by the boat and gear owner. The share of the labor also varied by
the type of work performed (catching, drying, transporting, cooking on boat etc.). The
average prices of Galda at landing centers are varied from BDT 290 to 750 kg-1. The average
prices of Galda at landing centers and in international markets were BDT 290 and 750 kg-1,
respectively in 2006. The Department of Forest, being the legal authority in the management
of aquatic resources inside the waters of the SME of Bangladesh should care the sustainable
management of small-scale fisheries to ensure a sustainable growth rate of Galda, and protect
over exploitation. Proper and easy financial and credit supports is needed for the economic
betterment of the small fishers. Hence the findings and the recommendations of this study is
supposed to be helpful for policy makers in improving the current status of Galda fishery and
relevant human livelihood as well as conserving the Sundarbans Mangrove Ecosystem
ecosystem.

Introduction
The reverie giant prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, locally called as Galda, is one of the
high valued crustaceans in Bangladesh and also a highly valued product in international
markets; almost all prawns are therefore exported, particularly to the USA, Japan, and
Europe. Traditionally, freshwater prawns have been caught wild in ponds and marshes (Gain,
1998) through artisanal fisheries across the country. It has been widely distributed in all types
of freshwater habitats and also migrates to the costal saline estuaries for breeding.
The species is cultivated across Bangladesh in freshwater ponds for export. Between
the late 1970s and the mid-1980s, a few pioneering farmers in Fakirhat Upazila (sub-district)
in Bagerhat district developed Galda farming technology in small rice-fields using mainly
rain water and peripheral mud embankments (Rutherford, 1994). In 1976 Bangladesh
exported a total of 3,800 mt of shrimps and prawns, and in just twenty years this grew
2

eightfold to 31,500 mt. Of this total, approximately 85% were cultured, half of them are from
fresh water. These exports earned 248 million dollars, equivalent roughly to a 3% share of the
world‟s total shrimp/prawn exports (Vannuccini, 1999). Bangladesh exported 46,533 mt of
prawn and shrimp in 2005 valued at US$ 378 million in which 25–30% was contributed by
prawn (DoF, 2006). This figure is expected to rise with the increasing expansion of
freshwater prawn cultivation into new area of Mymensingh district in the north-central part of
Bangladesh (Ahmed et al., 2008). The total area under cultivation nationwide is estimated to
be around 30,000 ha (Willams, 2003). Assuming that the royalty rate is only 12.5% of the
gross value of the products, it can be calculated that the gross value of the fish products in
1990-91 was BDT 112 million (US$ 2.8 million) (Islam, 2007).
The Sundarbans, a cluster of islands with an approximate area of 10,000 square
kilometers in Bangladesh and India, is the largest mangrove forest in the world (Rahman et
al., 2003). It is located at the southern extremity of the Ganges delta bordering the Bay of
Bengal along the southwest of Bangladesh and southeast of India. About 60% of the
Sundarbans are within Bangladesh territory, known as the Sundarbans Reserved Forest (SRF)
or Sundarbans Mangrove Ecosystem (SME), is located at the southwest part adjacent to the
district of Bagerhat, Khulna and Satkhira. Ecologically the SRF is classified in to three
ecological zones- i) freshwater zone along the Eastern part within Sarankhola range; ii)
moderately saline zone along the middle-southern part within Khulna range and iii) high
saline zone along the south-western part within Satkhira range (Karim, 1994). Mangrove
ecosystems act as nursery grounds and provide refuges for many species of fish, crustacean
and mollusks (Ronnback, 2001; Ronnback, 1999). There is a positive correlation between
mangrove area and shrimp/fish catches (Primavera, 1995 and 1997). It has been estimated
that every hectare of mangrove generates upwards of 450 kg ha-1 of marine catch (WB,
2006). The continued existence and functionality of the Sunderbans mangrove forest is of
critical importance to the entire marine fishery of the Bay of Bengal. An estimated 80% of
the Indian fish catch from the Ganges and Brahmaputra river deltas originates in the
Sundarbans mangroves (Hinrichsen, 1998), while others estimate that perhaps as much as
90% of commercial fish catches in the Bay of Bengal rely on Bangladesh‟s Sundarbans
Reserved Forest as a nursery area (Rouf and Jensen, 2001). About 20% of Bangladesh‟s
coastal communities rely exclusively on wild fisheries for their income (Barkat and Roy,
2001). About BDT 30 million (US$ 750,000) per annum is earned from 60 million kg of
shrimps, mainly tiger prawns, from the Sundarbans and other coastal mangrove areas of
Bangladesh (DoF, 2005; BBS, 2005).
A large number of fishing community is involved in Galda fishing from the SME. An
average of 67,195 boats with 165,270 fishermen annually visits the Sundarbans and fish for
their livelihood (DoF, 2008a). Recent data reveals that the collection of "seed" prawns
involves about 25,000 men, women and children (DoF, 2008b). Shell collection also
contributes to the employment of young boys and girls (about 550 permit issues each
engaging 3-4 people each year). The number of shell collectors increases during the winter
tourist season (Rahman et al., 2003; Giasuddin, 2002). While there is great potential for
increasing family incomes through engaging in prawn cultivation, a number of factors might
contribute to the vulnerability of prawn farmers including increased production costs, poor
institutional support, and inadequate extension services (Ahmed, 2002); on the other hand,
those factors are less effective in wild fishery. With this view, it is essential to understand the
external facilities available for harvesting Galda from SME.

However, no information is available on the Galda fishery in particular in the above
context in the SME. This study, therefore, was aimed at to assess the available marketing and
financial supports for Galda (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) fishery from the Sundarbans
mangrove ecosystem of Bangladesh. The findings will benefit fishers, researcher and
policymakers.
Literature Review
The existing literature on aquatic species in Bangladesh are by large focused on the farming
aspects rather than fishery (Halim et al., 2001; Ling et al., 1999; Huda et al., 2002;
Aftabuzzaman, 1998; Thomas et al., 2001; Bhattacharya et al., 1999a and 1999b; Leung and
Sharma, 2001; Ling et al., 2001; Shang et al., 2001). Most of the economic analyses carried
out in the past in Bangladesh were concentrated on aquaculture production of Galda or
Bagda shrimps (Shah et al., 2000; Ito, 2002; Ahmed et al., 2008; Alam et al., 2007; Ahmed,
2001; UNEP, 1999; BCAS, 2001; Quddus et al., 2001; Manju, 1996). Exploration of the
Sundarban mangroves dates back to the 16th century (Rollet, 1981), a large bulk of published
literature exists on the Sundarbans of both India (Naskar and Guha Bakshi, 1987; Chaudhuri
and Choudhury, 1994; Guha Bakshi et al., 1999) and Bangladesh (Seidensticker et al., 1991;
Hussain and Acharya, 1994; Islam and Wahab, 2005) covering many aspects of their habitat
characteristics, flora, fauna (particularly fisheries), utilization and management. However,
little is known about the functional aspects of this ecosystem.
Alam (2001) described three different levels of fish markets including Galda
marketing. A detailed description of Galda marketing is available in Tsai and Ali (1997).
Rutherford (1994) outlined the marketing structure of the freshwater prawn industry, together
with the financial flows with five layers of agency. At the top are fish-processing and export
companies located in Khulna town. Below them are the commission agents who buy prawns
from local middlemen (Depot Maliks) and sell them on to the companies for a commission:
many of these commission agents are wealthy businessmen in Khulna who have easy access
to bank loans. The third layer is composed of the Depot Maliks (storage-owners-cum-fishbuyers) themselves, who purchase prawns from local producers and sell them on to
commission agents. It is impossible to miss their presence, since this is registered in almost
all the local prawnfarming markets in Bagerhat and Khulna by the large signboards of the
individual Depot Maliks bearing huge, garish pictures of prawns and shrimps. They often buy
prawns directly from prawn farmers, but there are also local small traders called Forias who
mediate between local farmers and Depot Maliks (Ito, 2002).
Although there are several internationally recognized grading system (counts/lb) for
Galda marketing (FAO, 2004), it is absent in the primary markets at local levels mainly due
to poor bargaining power of the fishers unlike mud crab prices (Zafar and Ahsan, 2006).
Moreover, there is a little variation in selling prices due to transport costs and available
marketing facilities. Locally all Galda catches from the SME are marketed at fresh condition.
Quality maintenance facilities (ice or other processing facilities) in the SME are very poor.
There is high risk of spoilage of the harvested catch if collector boats respond late. There is
also a lack of knowledge about sound post-harvest practices (Zafar and Ahsan, 2006).
Like other fisheries product, Galda trading is characterized by several categories of
fishermen and fishing enterprises with the share arrangement regime (Dastidar, 2001;
Hussain et al., 1995; Coulter and Disney, 1987). There have a strong relationship between
market demand for Galda and the supply of credit. There is a separate distribution channels
4

for Galda marketing. Dastidar, (2001), Hussain et al., (1995) and Zafar and Ahsan, (2006)
mentioned that mud crab and shrimp trading, other than fish, in the region has increasing
consistently over the past few years, only due to higher demand for Galda in the international
markets. European-union, Malaysia, Japan, USA and Singapore are the main markets for
frozen Bangladeshi Galda. There seems to be significant fluctuation in the market prices of
Galda due to the wide seasonal variations in the landings volume and seasonal demand by the
export markets (Hill, 1984).
Bostock et al., (2004) also mentioned that the owners of small mechanized Galda
fishing boats in Bangladesh do not have enough money to finance their journey to the sea.
They have to borrow money from the moneylenders and the loan system is the same as the
cultured shrimp production system. When these boats land on the shore the boat owners had
to sell shrimps to their respective moneylenders or local traders at lower prices to compenset
the interest on the borrowed money. The traders then sell the shrimps to the processing
factories. The processing factories sell frozen shrimp of various categories sell out their
products to the foreign buyers through brokers. Sometimes shrimps are supplied to the
factories by depot owners. The moneylenders sell shrimp to the depots which is eventually
supplied to the processing factories through local Foria (brokers).
Unlike other inland closed fishing communities, coastal seas and tidal rivers constitute
the key traditional livelihoods assets and the main sources of financial capital to the coastal
fishing communities throughout the access to informal and the quasi-formal credit markets
(Ulrich et al., 2003; PDO-ICZMP, 2003b; CDSP-II, 2000). The main form of loan is the
Dadan. Dadon provider is the key player (i.e. fish trader cum money-lender) in controlling
fishing effort and marketing of harvested Galda from the SME area. Other actors of the
informal credit markets are the crab depots, fish depots and moneylenders, while the NGOs
are considered as the actors of quasi-formal credit market (Ulrich et al., 2003; Hannan, 1996).
Fishers‟ access to the formal credit market (i.e. scheduled banks) is virtually limited
due to their lack of tangible assets, although bank rate is lower than other informal markets.
The rate of credit from moneylenders is sometime even lower in areas of strong supply of
micro-credits from the NGOs. However, interest rate of micro-credits is also higher (75200%) than the bank rate (BBS, 1999; Islam, 2002; Grameen Bank, 2001; Ulrich et al.,
2003). Alam (2001) reported that more than 500 NGOs were involved in aquaculture and
fisheries in Bangladesh targeting over 250,000 households. However, while most NGO
programs focus on aquaculture demonstration and training for the poorest segments of rural
society, small-scale fishermen find difficulty in obtaining credit facilities. Nandeesha and
Alam (2001) reported that about 800 CARE staffs were involved in extending aquaculture
activities among 40,000 targeted households of which 20-30% were involved mostly in
mostly rice-fish culture.
As traders are powerful in both market control and socially, browbeaten fishermen
through weak loan arrangements with traders actually reflect inefficiencies of the credit
system rather than marketing system. Fishing season also affect the demand for wage labor
and obviously access to credit. For example, before the start of the main fishing season they
need a special attention to face financial crises during off-season generally from May to
August (Hannan, 1996). But in the present study, the main fishing season was found during
monsoon months from June to September?

Data and Methodology
This study was conducted through several field surveys in the SME waters covering three
administrative ranges (Figure 1). The SME is located between longitudes 89°00‟ E and
89°55‟ E and latitudes 21°30‟ N and 22°30‟ N at the south-west of Bangladesh,
encompassing mouth of the 6 estuaries, and numerous rivers, canals and creeks (Giri and
Shrestha, 1996; Viju, 1995).

Figure 1: Map of Sundarbans where Range Headquarters are study areas
The study was conducted through 24 individual surveys in the SME of Bangladesh
covering 16 river/canals and 32 locations (one-third area) of the Sundarbans along the
Mongla-Passure-Dubla area within Sharankhola, Chandpai and Khulna ranges between
January and December 2006 at fortnightly interval (Table 1).

The data were collected by direct interviews of randomly selected 1,989 fishermen
from 545 non-mechanized boats and 1,428 active gears from eight types of gear. The data
were analyzed through descriptive statistics (mean, range, standard deviation) by using SPSS
software. The monthly variation in abundance of Galda was estimated by using one-way
ANOVA.
Records of Harvesting Galda Fish from SME
The productions of Galda from the artisanal fishery inside the SME are recorded by the
Department of Forest (DoF), Bangladesh. Total SME annual production showed marked
variation between years, being the highest (290,431.60 kg) in 2001 and the lowest (110,515
kg) in 2002 (Figure 2). After 2002, the production increased steadily up to 2004. Among the
four administrative ranges, the mean yearly production volumes from Khulna range were
significantly higher (105,360±59,419 kg/yr) than Satkhira (44,165±18,548), Chandpai
(22,532±6,593) or Sharankhola (21,910±7,364). Figure 3 indicates a significant effect of
geographic location on production of Galda in the SME. However, there were marked
variation in number of fishing gears, boats and fishers among the ranges.

Among different months, the highest production (296478±10675 kg) was recorded in
January and the lowest in July (59750±4413 kg). After January, the production rate declined
steadily until May and thereafter started to increase gradually with a sudden fall in July
(recognized as lowest production month). This trend suggests that Dry summer and monsoon
seasons are not suitable for good catch of Galda in the SME (Table 2).

Although the highest number of fishers (21807) was engaged in fishing in 2000
(Table 3), but the highest production volume was registered for 2001 (Table 4).
Comparatively higher numbers of fishers were entered in the Satkhira range (2546 to 7734)
than the (Khulna range (4170 to 7063), Sharankhola range (2854 to 3893) and Chandpai
range (2412 to 3160) (Table 3). The production data were also compared by geographical
locations remarked by administrative ranges. It reveals that Khulna range was the best for
higher Galda landings (105360±59419) kg) in comparison to Satkhira (44165±18548),
Chadpai (22532±6593) and Sharankhola (21910±7364) range.

The monthly and daily harvest volume (CPUE) of Galda shrimp from the SME
recorded by the Department of Forest between 2000 and 2004 from four administrative
ranges are presented in Table 4. The highest mean monthly harvest was recorded from
Satkhira range at 16,939±11734 kg in 2000, while the minimum harvest was recorded at
8

883±3060 kg from the Chandpai range. The daily CPUE (kg/day) was found to be the highest
at 1210±838 kg in the Satkhira range in 2000, followed by 1082±750 kg in 2002 from the
same range. Both the monthly and daily CPUE were significantly varied among the ranges
between 2000 and 2004.

The abundance of Galda (kg/ha) has been estimated from DoF landing data it was the
highest 1.5375±1.7 kg/ha in 2001 and the lowest 0.61±0.34 kg/ha in 2002 (Figure 4). There
was a significant variation in mean abundance of Galda between the ranges, being the highest
in Khulna (2.176±1.23 kg/ha) and the lowest in Sharankhola (0.56±0.19 kg/ha) range (Figure

Structure of Local Market for Selling Galda Fish
The marketing chain of M. rosenbergii caught from the SME is similar to the existing fish
marketing channel in the southwest region of Bangladesh. Trading of Galda in the region has
been boosted up in recent to meet growing international market demand. As a consequent, the
production from aquaculture farm and harvest from natural sources including the SME have
been increased steadily over the past few years.
Several categories of fishermen and fish catching enterprises have been identified,
namely, (i) fishing labour who work on other‟s boats only during fishing trip; (ii) fishers with
their own boats; (iii) fisher use other‟s boats in fishing under catch-share agreement with boat
owners; and (iv) employed fishers who receive fixed salary from the boat owners. For the 3rd
category, boat owners receive the lion share (50-60%) of the catch. Employed fishers usually
receive a wage at BDT 50–100 day-1plus daily meals during fishing on boat. The boat owners
may not join in fishing, but can sell the entire catch himself and keep the whole revenues.
The income-sharing arrangement between boat owner and crews varies from area to
area. The conditions i.e., covering of operational costs, share distribution according to crew‟s
function etc. observed in the present study agrees well with the findings of Rahman (1993).
Crew‟s functional service also includes catching, drying, transporting and support services,
such as cooking. Present study also found that the strong involvement of head fisher, assistant
head fisher and laborers with fishing than the boat owners and other fishers, such as cooks,
helpers, net makers, repairers. The boat owners‟ second most important job is business, while
other fishers are involved with different occupations for varying periods.
Hussain et al., (1995) reported that boat owner obtains the biggest portion of the catch
(~50–60%), whilst the crew obtains the remainder. In the present study 40-60% share is
occupied by the boat owners and crews receive salary plus meals paid (BDT 50–100 day-1)
and a part as a bonus depending on the amount of fish caught calculated using an agreed
formula. Fishermen-dadandar-aratdar-trader-paikers-dalal-faria-beparies-processing plant
authority relationships (Dastidar, 2001; Hussain et al., 1995; Coulter and Disney, 1987; Hill,
1984; Hussain et al., 1995) have exerted a propensity to sell catches at the landing centers
(CODEC, 1994; Zafar and Ahsan, 2006). Similar trend has been found in the present study.
Conventionally, a Dadan (advance loan) borrower is bound to sell his catch to his
Dadandar (advance loan payer) at prices lower than market prices. Dadondars form the
primary market at landing centers. They also play as intermediary traders to sell their
purchased goods to the secondary markets. They actually play the role of assemblers at the
landing centers (primary markets). They also preformed as the wholesalers who trade goods
between secondary and higher secondary markets (i.e. wholesale markets) of the country. In
general, paikers (wholesaler) are tied to a limited number of Aratdars (warehouse owner)
who provide them loans as working capital. If they have Dadan from an Aratdar, they have
to sell/buy their fish through/from him, using him as a commission agent who usually gets 36% commission for his services and costs involved. Part of the commission (2-3%) may
represent an informal form of interest charged by the Aratdars. Moreover, Aratdars play
several brokerage functions at the same time. This includes commission agent mentioned
above or wholesaler whereby they become the buyer and seller of the commodity (Figure 7).

Financial Supports for Small Galda Fishers
The artisanal fishery in the Sundarbans is largely dependent on the supply of credits from
various sources. Credits are mainly used to cover purchasing/repairing fishing unit and food
costs for the both fishers during a fishing trip and their families at home. The volume of
credit received by the fishers varied from BDT 400 to 45,500. However, most of the fisher
(36.28%) had a credit limit between BDT 1,000 and 5,000. Only 3.23% fishers‟ had a
comparatively larger volume of credit ranged between BDT 10,000 and 15,000 (Table 5).

Three types of credits markets, namely- formal, informal and the quasi-formal were
found to exist as the source of credit supply to the fishers for operating artisanal fishery in the
SME (Table 6). Informal sources were found to be the key players in supplying credits to
Galda fishers. Institutions that lend credit or Danon to Galda fishing community included
were banks (formal source), NGOs (the quasi-formal source), Dadondar, fish traders and
suppliers (fish trader), and broker (Foria, i.e., middlemen in various forms). Among different
money lenders, the fish trader-cum-money lender was found to be the key traditional actor for
in supplying credit for most of the fishing operations inside the SME. The volume of Dadan
depends on economic condition of the fishers and the gear used. The highest 58.63% fishers
received credits from Dadondars. A larger part of the fishers (23.08%) collected credits from
family enterprise. About 9.19% fishers receive credit from local money lenders (other than
fish traders). Only 7.8% and 1.3% fishers received credits from the NGOs and the banks,
respectively (Table 6). The conditions for credit were varied by volume and location.
Generally a Dadan borrower is obliged to sell his catch to the Dadandar at 20-40% lower
prices than actual market prices which can be considered as informal interest. Most of the
money lending organizations was located in the fish trading centers at close proximity of the
12

SME. The major Galda trading centers were found at Munshiganj of Satkhira; Rupsh fish
market, Nutan Bazar fish market, Koyra and Paikgacha of Khulna; and Mongla, Rampal,
Digraj and Soronkhola of Bagerhat district.

There was access of fishers to the formal credit markets (i.e. scheduled banks or
cooperatives) at 13±2.83 (11-15)% interest. However, the rate of interest offered by the
NGOs significant higher (mean: 45±31, range: 18-76%) than the bank rates. In some remote
rural areas, where the number of NGOs are fewer, they charge interest rate as maximum at
47-150%. While, Foria and local money lenders supply credit at comparatively lower rates
(32±10, 19-42%) after the formal banks. Trading centers that dealing single species (shrimp,
crab, fish or Galda) offere an interest rate of 42±17 (25-65) % while multi-species trading
centers offered a comparatively lower rates (40±15, 55-24%. A number of formalities were
found to inhibit fishers to receive credit from Banks and NGOs. For instance, banks and
NGOs have a strict time period (6-12 months) to return credit with interest which is absence
of in the informal credit markets. Comparatively longer processing time (1-6 months) in
issuing credit by the formal sources was found another vital factor that also inhibits fishers to
receive credits from these sources.
13

It is also evident from the present study that the „exploitation‟ of fishers was mainly
due to the weak loan agreements between the fishers and traders. This indicates the
inefficiency of credit system rather than marketing system. However, credit conditions were
more favorable to the fishers in the areas closer to the fishing locations than the distant areas.
In absence of formal credit sources, there is an informal profit-sharing arrangement in the
fishery which varies from area, the type of fishery and the fishing season. For instance, 60100% of the value of Galda catch, after covering the operational costs, was taken by the boat
and gear owner (100% if hired crews are paid by cash). The remaining part (<40%) was
distributed among the hired fishing labors. The share of the labor also varied by the type of
work performed (catching, drying, transporting, cooking on boat etc.).
Market Supports for Small Galda Fishers
Most of the fishers tend to sell their catch to the collector boats at fishing place within the
SME area or at the landing centers. The source of credit, agreement of Dadan, variability in
prices, profit distribution agreement between boat/gear owner and the fishing labour, catch
volume, and the relation between the fisher and the landing centers (i.e., intimacy and
expected market prices) were found to be determinant factors in determining the place for
landings of the harvested catches in the study area. About 55% of the respondent fishers sold
their catch at Notun bazar of Khulna district. The rest of the respondents landed their catches
equally (18.18%) at Digraj, Mongla of Bagerhat district and Rupsha wholesale market,
Khulna. Only a few fishers (9.09%) landed their catches at Joimuni of Bagerhat district.
Although there is international grading system in Galda marketing chain, it was found
to vary by location and the level of marketing chain. The wholesaler/Aratder purchase Galda
from the supplier or lower intermediaries at different rate or at a common rate but sold at
higher rate or grade to the exporters/export suppliers. Generally fishermen sell out their
harvested Galda to the local traders at size-weight basis. About 50% of the harvest were sold
at grade 20, <10% at grade 5 or 10. The remaining Galda were equally divided between
grades 30 and 50. The average landing center price of Galda depends on grade which varied
from US$ 2.6 to 6.5 kg-1 (Table 7). The international grading and selling prices are presented
in the Table 8. The average prices of Galda at landing centers are varied from BDT 290 to
750 kg-1. The average prices of Galda at landing centers and in international markets were
BDT 290 and 750 kg-1, respectively in 2006.

Local market prices for Galda were found to vary largely by season (Table 9). The
rank 1 to 4 indicates prices of Galda in different seasons in descending order. The average
maximum price was BDT 430.50 kg-1 during Ashin-Kartik (Sep. to Nov.) followed by the dry
(BDT 414 kg-1) and winter, pre-winter, wet season (June to September, BDT 337.50 kg-1).

Conclusion and Recommendation
The study conducted to focus the marketing and financial supports for small-scale artisanal
Galda fishery in the SME of Bangladesh. Here, credit flows are not in favor of the fisher. The
highest 58.63% fishers received credits from Dadondars. About 9.19% fishers received credit
from local money lenders. Only 7.8% and 1.3% fishers received credits from the NGOs and
the banks, respectively.
The Department of Forest is the legal authority in the management of aquatic
resources inside the waters of the SME of Bangladesh. The authority should care the
sustainable management of small-scale fisheries to ensure a sustainable growth rate of Galda,
and protect over exploitation. Proper and easy financial and credit supports is needed for the
economic betterment of the small fishers. Proper processing and preserving services are also
needed for better price and international market. Government intervention in the Marketing

15

channel also needed to avoid many middlemen as well as to reduce the timing gap between
catch to preserve.
