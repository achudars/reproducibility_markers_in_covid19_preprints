Abstract
As many as 45% of transgender individuals experience gender-based victimisation
(GBV), including physical and sexual violence; social, workplace, and housing discrimination;
and family or social rejection. In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals
experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive
events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual‚Äôs gender identity. The degree to
which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify,
sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income
and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed
to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income, and non-white
race/ethnicity were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals
experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation
microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of U.S. adolescent and adult transgender
persons (ùëõ = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions,
adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation
microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased
average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing
and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.

Factors Associated with Frequency of Gender Identity Nonaffirmation
Microaggressions among Transgender Persons
Introduction
As many as 45% of transgender individuals experience gender-based victimisation
(GBV), which can include physical and sexual violence; social, workplace, and housing
discrimination; and rejection in family, social, and media (e.g., social or news media) contexts
(Barboza, Dominguez, and Chance 2016; Bradford et al. 2013; Goldblum et al. 2012; McNeil,
Ellis, and Eccles 2017). Experiencing GBV is associated with depression and anxiety
symptoms, substance use, and suicidality among transgender persons, including with an up to
fourfold increase in likelihood of attempting suicide (Clements-Nolle, Marx, and Katz 2006;
Haas, Rodgers, and Herman 2014; Klein and Golub 2016; Tebbe and Moradi 2016; Testa et al.
2012; Wolford-Clevenger et al. 2018). In addition to overt GBV, transgender individuals
experience victimisation in the form of gender identity-related microaggressions, which can be
defined as subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection
of an individual‚Äôs gender identity (Nadal, Rivera, and Corpus 2010; Sue et al. 2007). Among
transgender persons, experiencing increased frequency of identity nonaffirmation
microaggressions is associated with 150‚Äì240% greater odds of past-year depression symptoms,
past-year suicide ideation, and lifetime suicide ideation or attempt (Parr and Howe 2019).
Common identity nonaffirmation microaggressions include misuse of gendered
pronouns or an individual‚Äôs preferred name, being stared at in public, being asked invasive or
objectifying questions about one‚Äôs body or stage of transition, or being instructed to use a public
facility of a different gender (Nadal, Rivera, and Corpus 2010; Parr and Howe 2019).
Nonaffirmation microaggressions can occur both interpersonally and via social or other forms

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

of media; examples of the latter include witnessing a transgender person being asked intrusive
questions about their genitalia or gender confirmation procedures, or hearing public expressions
or insinuations that to be transgender is associated with psychological or physiological
pathologies or abnormalities (Nadal, Rivera, and Corpus 2010; Parr and Howe 2019). While the
occurrence of both overt and subtle forms of victimisation related to gender identity have been
linked to poor psychosocial outcomes among transgender individuals, victimisation in the form
of microaggressions may pose a particularly acute risk to transgender individuals‚Äô
socioemotional health because microaggressions frequently occur as a part of daily life and may
lead to an ongoing state of perceived identity rejection or nonaffirmation (Galupo, Henise, and
Davis 2014; Nadal et al. 2014; Parr and Howe 2019).
The development and impact of chronic states of socioemotional stress that are related to
one or more minority identities has been examined using the minority stress model, among both
cisgender sexual and racial minorities (Meyer 2003) and transgender individuals (Testa et al.
2015). As elaborated by the minority stress model, stressors related to minority identity are
additive to more commonly experienced stressors (e.g., relationship or financial strain,
academic stress, or concern over job performance) (Meyer 2003). Testa et al. (2015) define a
type of gender minority-specific stressor, nonaffirmation, which describes experiences in which
a gender minority person feels their gender identity is not positively recognised or affirmed by
others, or is reduced, denied, or invalidated. As described above, nonaffirmation can be
conveyed through microaggressions (Chang and Chung 2015; Parr and Howe 2019; Testa et al.
2015). Gender identity nonaffirmation microaggressions can be expressed in many forms:
Nadal, Rivera, and Corpus (2010) developed a thematic taxonomy of nine types of sexual and
gender identity nonaffirmation microaggressions, and additional research (e.g., Galupo, Henise,

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

5

and Davis 2014; Galupo and Resnick 2016; Parr and Howe 2019) has aimed to further identify
transgender-specific nonaffirmation microaggressions, to elaborate contexts and conditions
which enable nonaffirmation microaggressions, and to relate experiences of nonaffirmation
microaggressions to the occurrence of mental health outcomes. Parr and Howe (2019), for
instance, found increases in average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggression
events to be associated with substantially elevated risk of depression symptoms and suicidality
among transgender persons.
As the impact of nonaffirmation microaggressions continues to be characterised, an
important and parallel need is to investigate factors that may increase or decrease the frequency
with which nonaffirmation microaggressions occur among transgender persons. Identifying
such factors may help to further define and describe the minority stress environment occupied
by transgender individuals, and to facilitate identification of modifiable risk and protective
factors. Conceivably, these factors may be grouped into at least two domains: aspects of
physiology or gender presentation that serve to disclose or conceal transgender identity, and
resources (e.g., income) that may govern transgender individuals‚Äô access to identity-affirming
healthcare or to environments that are more supportive or less aversive to their gender identity
(e.g., more inclusive neighborhoods or cities). We next describe prior work to examine each of
these domains and how they may relate to the occurrence of identity nonaffirmation
microaggressions.
Concealment, Disclosure, and Passing
The degree to which a transgender individual is perceived as the gender with which they
identify (e.g., as a woman if they have transitioned to a female gender identity), sometimes
referred to as passing, has been proposed as a moderator of minority stress experiences

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

6

(Gamarel et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2016). Degree of passing is a function of numerous individual
attributes, including physiological features and traits (such as body shape, facial features, and
voice), clothing, and hairstyle. Physiological attributes that align with an individual‚Äôs gender
identity may only be accessible through medical procedures or may not be accessible at all
depending on individual physiology; as a result, passing is not universally accessible (Testa et
al. 2015). Further, such alignment is defined by social norms and expectations, and by
consequence, individuals can have their transgender identity involuntarily disclosed when their
body or other aspects of gendered expression are perceived to violate those norms and
expectations. Such disclosures of transgender identity may elevate one‚Äôs likelihood of
experiencing gender identity-related victimisation. Indeed, transgender individuals report
concern that not passing risks their personal safety (Rood et al. 2017), and link an inability to
pass with social and workplace discrimination and conflicts (Bockting 2008; Xavier et al.
2013). Moreover, inability to pass may lead to more frequent experiences of identity
nonaffirmation microaggressions, such as being stared at in public, or being subjected to
unwanted and invasive questioning about one‚Äôs body, transgender identity, or transition.
Importantly, passing represents a complex negotiation of personal and social identity,
and is not always a desired aim of transgender persons (Sevelius 2013; Teich 2012). For some
transgender individuals, passing can represent a final stage of transition marked by being
perceived as a (cisgender) person of the gender with which they identify. At the same time,
however, this perception of alignment with social norms of a male or female gender identity
may produce concerns for transgender individuals, including anxiety related to controlling
disclosure of their identity as a transgender person or feelings of disconnection from
transgender cultures and communities; these ongoing concerns may, themselves, become a form

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

7

of minority stress for transgender persons (Sevelius 2013). Passing has also been recognised as
problematically connoting the appearance of occupying the gender with which one identifies
rather than the actual occupation of that gender, and as being reflective of inflexible and noninclusive social gender norms rather than of a meaningful stage of a transgender person‚Äôs
transition to the gender with which they identify (Davidmann 2010). Nevertheless, transgender
individuals have reported that not sufficiently appearing as a cis-typical gender identity, often
operationalised as not passing, leads to experiencing some form of stigmatisation frequently or
even daily (Sevelius 2013). Being perceived as non-cisgender may also precipitate both overt
victimisation and discrimination and more subtle forms of stigmatisation and invalidation such
as identity nonaffirmation microaggressions (Begun and Kattari 2016; Rundall and Vecchietti
2010).
Sociodemographic Factors
Access to passing, such as through resources for hormone therapy and gender
confirmation surgery, is sometimes referred to as passing privilege, or an individual‚Äôs ability to
access concealment of their stigmatised identity (Sevelius 2013; Xavier 1999). As such,
sociodemographic factors such as income, race/ethnicity, and age may relate to the frequency
with which transgender individuals experience identity nonaffirmation microaggressions. For
instance, these factors may serve as proxies for accessibility of passing, such that individuals
with higher income or that experience less stigmatisation related to other minority identities
may have greater resources for, and experience fewer systematic barriers to, knowledgeable and
affirming healthcare (Sevelius 2013). Further, sociodemographic factors may have a role in
facilitating (or limiting) a transgender person‚Äôs ability to alter situational aspects of their daily
experience that may be linked to risk of exposure to nonaffirmation microaggressions. Greater

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

financial resources or older age, for example, could enhance individuals‚Äô mobility to relocate to
an environment less hostile toward their identity, while lower income or younger age could
limit this mobility. Indeed, Reisner et al. (2016) found that transgender persons with higher
income had fewer experiences of everyday discrimination (e.g., being treated with less respect
than other people; Williams et al. 1997), while Bockting and colleagues (2013) and Bradford
and colleagues (2013) found that among transgender individuals, having a non-white
race/ethnicity and having lower income were associated with experiencing gender-related
discrimination.
In summary, there is a growing body of research examining the impact of gender
identity-related victimisation, discrimination, and stigmatisation experiences on transgender
individuals‚Äô mental health and social wellbeing. Complementary to this research is study of
factors that may place transgender individuals at greater risk of encountering victimisation
experiences, including qualitative study to identify potential risk and protective factors and
quantitative investigation to verify and assess the magnitude of relations between risk factors
and the occurrence of gender-related victimisation. Existing qualitative literature has elucidated
a number of potential predictors of victimisation experiences, including degree of passing and
sociographic factors such as income and race/ethnicity, but there remains a need to further
validate their relation with varying forms of gender identity-related victimisation. To address
this gap, in the present study we investigate whether self-rated degree of passing is associated
with frequency of minority stress experiences in the form of identity nonaffirmation
microaggressions among both adult and adolescent transgender persons. We also examine
whether sociodemographic factors, including age, annual income, and race/ethnicity, are
associated with microaggression frequency. A priori hypotheses were that lower self-rated

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

9

degree of passing, lower income, and non-white race/ethnicity would be independently
associated with a higher average weekly frequency of identity nonaffirmation microaggressions.
A secondary hypothesis was that frequency of microaggressions would decrease with age, due
to age serving as a potential proxy for accessibility of passing. All phases of research were
approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Review Board.
Materials and Methods
As described in further detail in Parr and Howe (2019), a focus group study was
conducted with 36 adolescent and adult gender and sexual minority individuals in three
locations across the U.S.; from this study, 14 identity nonaffirmation microaggressions were
identified as commonly occurring among transgender participants. Reported microaggression
events were adapted into 14 situational prompts (see Appendix A) for a survey questionnaire
developed for online administration. This questionnaire was disseminated via social media
groups (e.g., Facebook groups), e-mail lists associated with U.S. national and regional
organisations serving transgender individuals, and through online social accounts or platforms
having a user base primarily composed of gender and sexual minority persons. An informed
consent procedure was integrated into the online survey platform and inclusion criteria for
participating in the survey were U.S. residence and being at least 14 years of age; there were no
specific exclusion criteria. Among adolescent participants aged 14‚Äì17 years, we were conscious
of the risk of unwanted disclosure of participants‚Äô gender and/or sexual identity should parental
notification or consent be required, and consequently we sought and were granted an
Institutional Review Board waiver of this requirement. During two rounds of dissemination
over an approximately three-month period, 886 survey responses were initiated. An 80%
completion threshold was implemented, after which 447 responses remained. As a result of the

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

10

recruitment approach described above, which was intended to maximise the number of
transgender individuals recruited, and because several of the social media platforms used to
disseminate the questionnaire were oriented toward sexual and gender minority persons
generally, respondents made up a convenience sample of both transgender and non-transgender
individuals (e.g., gender non-binary or cisgender sexual minority persons). The subsample of
respondents who identified as transgender (ùëõ = 224) was used for this study; gender non-binary
participants were not included in this subsample (see Limitations section for rationale).
Complete demographic information for transgender respondents is provided in Table 1.
Measures
Each microaggression prompt was followed by three items assessing the weekly
frequency and self-rated emotional intensity of the microaggression event, and the social and
emotional responses elicited by the event. In the present study, the frequency item (‚ÄúHow often
in a typical week do you feel something like this occurs to you?‚Äù) was used to calculate each
participant‚Äôs mean number of identity nonaffirmation microaggression events experienced per
week. Item internal consistency was assessed prior to calculating means and was found to be
high (ùõº = .88). Participants‚Äô average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions
served as the outcome variable in all analyses. Factors examined for their association with
frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included an item assessing self-rated passing
(‚ÄúDo you believe you visually ‚Äòpass‚Äô as the gender with which you identify?‚Äù), as well as
participant age category, annual income category, and race/ethnicity. To address imbalance in
responses to the race/ethnicity item, the variable was dichotomised into white (non-Hispanic)
and non-white categories. Additionally, a variable assessing the extent to which a participant
was ‚Äúout‚Äù as transgender within social and professional contexts (‚ÄúHow would you describe the

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

11

types and number of people who know about your status as a transgender person?‚Äù) was
included as a control variable in all final models to adjust for differing levels of openness or
concealment of transgender identity. Variable category levels are provided in Table 1.
Analytic Approach
Two sets of ordinary least squares multiple linear regression models were used to assess
relations of interest. One set included independent and control variables related to passing (selfrated degree of passing, with age and outness as transgender as control variables), and the
second contained sociodemographic variables (age, annual income, race/ethnicity) and highest
education level and outness as transgender as control variables. Fitting the sociodemographic
variables in a separate model was necessary because income was not assessed among adolescent
participants (those aged 14-17 years), and as a result those models used a reduced data set with
adolescent participants (ùëõ = 16) removed. Models were fitted in a hierarchical fashion: First,
initial models were fitted with only the passing and sociodemographic variables of interest,
followed by models with control variables added. Model multiple-ùëÖ$ was compared at each
step, and tenability of linear regression assumptions were inspected using final models. Further,
because data were available on respondents‚Äô region of residence, before single-level regression
was carried out an unconditional multilevel linear model (including only the microaggression
frequency outcome variable and the region variable at the cluster level) was fitted and intraclass
correlation coefficient calculated to assess whether substantial variation was present at the
higher regional level. The coefficient did not indicate regional variation in the outcome variable,
and as a result single-level regression models were used for all analyses. Finally, data were
inspected for missingness before analysis. Fewer than 1% of item responses were missing.
Those minimal data that were missing were primarily on sociodemographic variables, in a

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

12

pattern suggesting a potential violation of the missing at random assumption for data imputation
(e.g., all demographic items missing). Consequently, these data were not imputed and any
deletions to analytic samples are noted in Tables 3 and 4. Statistical significance was evaluated
at an ùõº = .05 using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were conducted in R Version
3.6.0 (R Core Team 2018; RStudio Team 2018).
Results
Descriptive Findings
Average weekly frequencies of identity nonaffirmation microaggressions by age and
status as a transgender woman or man are presented in Figure 1. The average frequency of
microaggressions among all participants (ùëõ = 224) was 1.22 microaggression events per week
(SD = 1.04, range = 0‚Äì5.57). Transgender women (ùëõ = 136) experienced an average of 1.12
microaggression events each week (SD = 0.94, range = 0‚Äì4.57), compared to 1.37 events (SD =
1.16, range = 0‚Äì5.57) among transgender men (ùëõ = 88). Transgender women and men did not
significantly differ in microaggression frequency.1 By age category, adolescents aged 14‚Äì17 (ùëõ
= 16) experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M
= 2.16 events, SD = 1.48); seven respondents experienced no microaggressions. Participant
response frequencies for passing-related variables and sociodemographic characteristics for the
total transgender participant sample, as well as transgender women and transgender men
subgroups, are provided in Table 1. For passing-related variables, the majority of participants
(61.7%) endorsed passing most or all of the time, while 21.5% indicated they do not pass all or
most of the time. A lower proportion of transgender women (54.4%) reported passing most or

Group difference in mean weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions was assessed using a Welch‚Äôs ùë°test for independent samples. The logarithm of frequency was used to adjust for nonnormality.

all of the time compared to transgender men (72.7%), while 43.0% of transgender women
endorsed being ‚Äúout‚Äù as transgender to most everyone in contrast to 15.9% of transgender men.
Responses of transgender women and men were significantly different on both the passing item
(ùúí $ = 11.61, ùëù = .032)2 and the outness item (ùúí $ = 21.47, ùëù = .002). Among sociodemographic
characteristics, transgender women and men significantly differed by age (ùúí $ = 41.84, ùëù = .002),
but they did not significantly differ by race/ethnicity, education level, or annual income.
Inferential Findings
Before interpretation of model results, model specification and fit were assessed.
Correlation among independent variables for both sets of models was first inspected and was
minimal, suggesting a lack of multicollinearity among predictor variables.3 Following model
fitting, examination of diagnostic plots indicated that linear regression assumptions were tenable
for final models reported in Tables 2 and 3. A sensitivity analysis (not shown) was conducted
on all models with participant status as transgender woman or transgender man included as a
predictor. Including gender status did not meaningfully alter model fit, explained variance,
interpretation of other predictors, or provide additional substantive findings, so the variable was
not included in final models.
Results of fitted models to assess the relation of passing and sociodemographic-related
variables with average weekly frequency of identity nonaffirmation microaggressions are shown
in Table 2 and 3. Final models explained a moderate amount of variance in the microaggression
frequency outcome (multiple-ùëÖ$ = .30‚Äì.31, adjusted multiple-ùëÖ$ = .25‚Äì.26). Degree of passing
was significantly associated with microaggression frequency, with lower degrees of passing
For ùúí $ -tests of differences between groups, ùëù-values were derived using a Monte Carlo procedure (500
replications) for exact estimation. As a result, degrees of freedom are not reported.

For the passing model predictors, median ùëü = .12 (range = -.06‚Äì.14), and for the sociodemographic model
predictors, median ùëü = .01 (range = -.21‚Äì.48).

associated with greater increases in microaggression frequency after adjusting for outness and
age. Compared to passing all of the time, passing most of the time was associated with a 0.51event increase in weekly microaggression frequency (SE = 0.16, 95% CI [0.19, 0.82]), while
never passing was associated with a 1.23-event increase in weekly microaggression frequency
(SE = 0.28, 95% CI [0.67, 1.79]). Among sociodemographic variables, earning a moderately
low annual income (US$20,000‚Äì34,999) was significantly associated with microaggression
frequency. Compared to earning greater than US$100,000 annually, a moderately-low income
was associated with a 0.67-event increase in average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation
microaggressions (SE = 0.24, 95% CI [0.21, 1.14]), adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, education
level, and degree of outness. Additionally, participant age levels of 25 years or older were
significantly associated with decreased average weekly frequency of microaggressions
compared to the 18‚Äì24 age category, after adjusting for annual income, race/ethnicity,
education, and degree of outness. Older age categories were found to have the most substantial
reduction in microaggression frequency, with ages 50‚Äì64 being associated with a 0.94-event
reduction in microaggression frequency (SE = 0.23, 95% CI [-1.39, -0.49]), and ages 65 or older
associated with a 1.16-event reduction in microaggression frequency (SE = 0.27, 95% CI [-1.69,
-0.62]). Having a non-white race/ethnicity was not found to be significantly associated with
frequency of microaggressions.
Discussion
Increased frequency of gender identity nonaffirmation microaggressions is associated
with substantially elevated odds of past-year suicide ideation and attempt, past-year withdrawal
from regular activities, and with past-year sadness or hopelessness (Parr and Howe 2019). To
extend this and other research that has linked degree of gender passing, income level, and

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

15

race/ethnicity to the occurrence of overt forms of gender-related victimisation among
transgender persons (e.g., Begun and Kattari 2016; Bockting et al. 2013; Reisner et al. 2016),
we examined whether the same factors influenced frequency of nonaffirmation
microaggressions among a sample of transgender survey respondents. We also investigated the
association of age with microaggression frequency, given the possibility that transgender
individuals at older ages may have different experiences of microaggressions or have greater
access to passing.
Study findings supported most hypotheses. We found that lower degrees of passing were
significantly related to increased weekly frequency of identity nonaffirmation microaggressions
after adjusting for the degree to which a transgender participant was ‚Äúout‚Äù as transgender and
for their age. Among sociodemographic variables, lower income was significantly associated
with experiencing a higher weekly frequency of microaggressions when adjusting for other
sociodemographic variables and outness. We also found that older age was associated with a
reduced weekly frequency of microaggressions. Additionally, while there was not a significant
association between non-white race/ethnicity and increased microaggression frequency in our
sociodemographic model, similar effect sizes were seen across both models and indicated an
increase in microaggression frequency among those with non-white race/ethnicity compared to
those with non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity. Non-white race/ethnicity was associated with an
increase of 0.14 events (SE = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.44]) in average weekly frequency of
microaggressions in the base model and an increase of 0.20 events (SE = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.09,
0.49]) in microaggression frequency in the final model after adjusting for annual income, age,
education, and degree of outness. The directionality of this finding is in alignment with prior
research relating race/ethnicity to experiencing gender-related victimisation (e.g., Bradford et al.

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

16

2013; Meyer 2003), and the non-significance of the coefficient here may be the result of the
relatively small representation of those of non-white race/ethnicity in the study sample. Finally,
in descriptive comparisons, transgender women and men were found to significantly differ in
their reported level of passing and level of outness as transgender, with transgender women
found to generally endorse lower degrees of passing and transgender men lower degrees of
outness. Future studies should investigate why such differences may be present, including the
possibilities that attainment of social or interpersonal expectations of ‚Äúfemaleness‚Äù may present
unique barriers to passing, that social environments accessed by transgender men may be
particularly aversive to being out as transgender, or that transgender men may feel less of a need
to be out given their higher reported perception of passing.
Limitations and Implications
This study has several limitations. As a cross-sectional survey design, causal relations
between degree of passing, sociodemographic factors, and the frequency of identity
nonaffirmation microaggressions experienced by transgender individuals could not be
ascertained. Moreover, the limited representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the study
sample prevents inference on the additive (or multiplicative) associations that race may have
with degree of passing, income, and other sociodemographic factors related to microaggression
frequency (Balsam et al. 2011). Another important limitation of this sample is that it did not
include respondents who identified as gender non-binary, gender non-conforming, or
genderqueer. Inclusion of transgender respondents only was related to the focus of analyses
being on passing as cisgender male or female, as operationalised in prior research (Gamarel et
al. 2014; Sun et al. 2016). We recognise, however, that non-binary persons likely experience
victimisation and related poorer health outcomes as a result of gender expressions not perceived

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

17

as cis-typical (Hart et al. 2019), and future studies in this line of research will assess passing in
relation to perception as non-cisgender so as to be more inclusive of gender non-binary persons
and experiences. Finally, while there was a disconcerting frequency of nonaffirmation
microaggressions found among adolescents in this study, participants aged 14‚Äì17 made up a
comparative minority of participants in the study sample. The findings of this study warrant
future research that focuses on adolescents and has the duel aims of more fully examining the
occurrence and experiences of nonaffirmation microaggressions and other gender identityrelated minority stressors during this key developmental stage, and of identifying approaches to
better facilitate access to gender-affirming healthcare and supportive school climates for
transgender youth.
Despite these limitations, the primary finding of this study that among a moderate size,
geographically- and age-diverse sample of transgender individuals, transgender persons‚Äô degree
of passing was significantly and substantially associated with the frequency with which they
experience gender identity nonaffirmation microaggressions sheds further light on how a
complex aspect of many transgender individuals‚Äô lived experience ‚Äì the degree to which they
are recognised as a cisgender person of the gender with which they identify ‚Äì relates to their
exposure to adverse everyday stressors that serve to delegitimise their identity. Additionally, the
finding that having a lower income is associated with experiencing a greater frequency of
nonaffirmation microaggressions aligns with prior quantitative study (e.g., Bockting et al. 2013;
Bradford et al. 2013) that has linked having a lower annual income with experiences of minority
stressors in the form of gender-related discrimination and victimisation, and provides support to
prior qualitative work (e.g., Sevelius 2013) in which transgender persons describe having
greater income as a proxy for access to gender-affirming healthcare (and, potentially,

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

18

experiencing a greater degree of passing). Future study using longitudinal data should extend
these findings by examining potential mediation relations (e.g., whether socioeconomic status
partially or fully mediates the relation between degree of passing and microaggression
frequency) in addition to the direct effects of these factors examined here. Lastly, with few
exceptions (e.g., Gamarel et al. 2014; Scandurra et al. 2017), to our knowledge most prior
studies that have assessed the occurrence of gender-related victimisation or discrimination have
done so discretely (i.e., assessing whether victimisation happened or not). In this study, a
continuous measure of victimisation intensity was utilised to provide finer-grained
understanding of the range with which gender-related victimisation in the form of
nonaffirmation microaggressions occurs among transgender individuals. Taken together, the
findings of this study underline that while passing to achieve alignment with a social
expectation of gender identity may not be obtainable or desirable for all transgender persons,
transgender individuals should receive sufficient social and clinical support to achieve the
expression of their gender identity with which they feel comfortable navigating their lived
environment. Doing so will not eliminate experiences of gender-related victimisation in either
overt or microaggressive forms, but such provisions may reduce the frequency with which they
occur among transgender persons.

included in income category counts/proportions. Differences in responses between selfidentifying transgender women and men were evaluated for statistical significance using ùúí $ tests with ùëù-values calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (500 replications) for exact
estimation; as a result, degrees of freedom are not reported. Boldface indicated significance at

Note. Participants aged 14‚Äì17 years excluded (minor participants did not endorse annual income item).
Reference level for the Age variable is the 18‚Äì24 category, for the Education level variable is high school
graduate, for the Annual Income variable is over 100,000, for the Race/Ethnicity variable is white (nonHispanic), and for the Outness variable is very few, if any. Education level of still in high school not
represented in analytic sample due to exclusion of minor participants. Boldface indicates statistical significance
at ùõº = .05. SE = standard error. CI = confidence interval. a Five observations deleted from analytic sample due
to missingness.

GENDER IDENTITY NONAFFIRMATION MICROAGGRESSION FREQUENCY

29

Figure 1. Average weekly frequencies of identity nonaffirmation microaggressions by age and
status as a transgender woman or transgender man. Error bars represent standard deviation of
mean microaggression frequency. One participant identified as a transgender man 65 years or
older, therefore no standard deviation is available for that category.
