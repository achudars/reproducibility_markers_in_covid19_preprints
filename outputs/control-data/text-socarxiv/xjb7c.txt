1. Introduction
Humans are among the minority of mammalian species in which females exhibit prolonged postreproductive lifespans [1]. Among anthropologists, adaptive explanations for this life history
strategy have focused on the inclusive fitness benefits of parental and grandparental investment
[2,3]. Expanding on these perspectives, Cant and Johnstone [4] observe that in addition to the
fitness effects of altruism, conceptual models also need to account for the inclusive fitness
consequences of reproductive conflicts. That is, reproductive conflict occurs in social groups,
including cooperative groups, when there are limited resources to support reproduction by
females in the group. In humans, for instance, increased offspring mortality has been documented
when a woman reproduces concurrently with her mother-in-law [5]. Females who are surrounded
by fewer genetic kin are predictably more indifferent to the reproductive costs that competition
inflicts than females living among many kin [4]. For example, whereas women are typically
unrelated to their mother-in-law’s offspring, her offspring will be the genetic grandoffspring
of the mother-in-law, who therefore has less to lose by ceding reproductive opportunities. To
understand whether the resolution of reproductive conflicts might have shaped the evolution of
life history strategies, we need a better understanding of the kinship structure among interacting
females and how this is influenced by demography.
The main factor that influences whether adult females are interacting with close kin is whether
and where they move relative to their parents’ location [6,7]. In most populations of mammals and
birds, there appears to be a strong sex bias in dispersal [8]. Accordingly, populations are generally
classified into those where females are philopatric and remain with their kin and those where
females disperse and join other, unrelated females. Empirical studies of kinship generally support
that in a given population females either remain with kin or not, but also highlight important
fluidity in these patterns where only subsets of females remain philopatric [9] or dispersing
females end up with kin [10]. Such fluidity in settlement patterns appears to characterize many
human populations [11], leading to potential differences between females in their relatedness to
other group members depending on their movement history, with corresponding implications for
the resolution of reproductive conflicts.
Arguments related to kinship structure among females are further complicated since it is
not a static aspect of a female’s environment, but changes dynamically across the lifespan
[12]. For instance, in human societies that are characterized by male philopatry and femalebiased dispersal, younger females are predicted to be surrounded by fewer genetic kin than

Abstract: A hypothesis for the evolution of long post-reproductive lifespans in the human
lineage involves asymmetries in relatedness between young immigrant females and the older
females in their new groups. In these circumstances, inter-generational reproductive conflicts
between younger and older females are predicted to resolve in favor of the younger females,
who realize fewer inclusive fitness benefits from ceding reproduction to others. This conceptual
model anticipates that immigrants to a community initially have few kin ties to others in the
group, gradually showing greater relatedness to group members as they have descendants
who remain with them in the group. We examine this prediction in a cross-cultural sample
of communities, which vary in their sex-biased dispersal patterns and other aspects of social
organization. Drawing on genealogical and demographic data, the analysis provides general but
not comprehensive support for the prediction that average relatedness of immigrants to other
group members increases as they age. In rare cases, natal members of the community also exhibit
age-related increases in relatedness. We also find large variation in the proportion of female
group members who are immigrants, beyond simple traditional considerations of patrilocality
or matrilocality, which raises questions about the circumstances under which this hypothesis of
female competition are met. We consider possible explanations for these heterogenous results, and
we address methodological considerations that merit increased attention for research on kinship
and reproductive conflict in human societies.

older females. In this scenario, females leave their kin and join a new group, where they mate
with males who are typically related to the older females in the group. Therefore, usually the
resulting offspring of these young females exhibit high genetic similarity to the older females
(with allowances for paternity uncertainty) such that older females are related to the majority of
individuals in their local group. This asymmetry favors younger females in reproductive conflicts
with older females, who have relatively more to gain via alloparental investment. According to
theory, these could be the conditions favoring the evolution of post-reproductive lifespans in
females [4].
The conceptual arguments linking kinship structure to residence patterns and age were
formalized quantitatively by Johnstone and Cant [1], who derive individuals‘ relatedness to
group members as a function of mating patterns and the dispersal and demography of males and
females, respectively. The model provides confirmatory evidence that when females disperse and
mating occurs within the local group, the relatedness of females to other group members increases
with age as they have sons who remain as breeding members of the group. Given the extent to
which female-biased dispersal characterizes hominoid species, this pattern is dubbed the "ape
case" [1]. The model is also flexible enough to accommodate the kinship dynamics of cetaceans,
another species with prolonged post-reproductive lifespans. Among killer whales, neither males
nor females disperse from their natal group, but because mating occurs with individuals outside
the group, females exhibit relatively low relatedness to males other than their sons [13]. As they
age and have more sons in the group, female killer whales therefore display overall increases in
average relatedness to other group members that parallel the aforementioned increases in the ape
case [13].
When applied to the evolution of human life history traits, the female-biased dispersal that
typifies African apes has often been assumed to characterize the social organization of human
ancestors [4]. By dispersing, young adult females may reside primarily among their mates’ female
kin, not their own. In that hypothesized scenario, the resulting reproductive conflicts among the
females potentially help to explain distinctive human traits, such as prolonged post-reproductive
lifespans. However, it is currently difficult to make strong empirical inferences about the social
organization of prehistoric hominins, particularly given the flexible residence and dispersal that
distinguish contemporary human societies [11]. Heterogeneous residence rules across human
societies include patrilocality and matrilocality, which purportedly correspond to the typical
dispersal patterns of the ape case and the typical mammalian case, respectively. In addition to
cross-cultural variability [15], adherence to normative residence rules within societies is likewise
variable. Human couples maintain affiliative bonds with both the husband‘s and wife‘s kin,
and the ability to move between these groups throughout an individual‘s life permits flexible
residence arrangements that can confound even seasoned ethnographers [16].
Given this diversity and flexibility, empirical research on kinship in human societies is needed
to inform our understanding of the potential for reproductive conflict and cooperation among
women. In this study, our aim is to investigate the extent to which movement influences kinship
patterns across human communities and whether this is associated with predictable variation
in individual levels of kinship across female lifespans. Given the expected flexibility in human
settlement patterns, and the extent to which individuals adhere to these rules, we consider
variation in group kinship across the lifespan for immigrants (of both sexes) in each community,
drawing contrasts to natal residents to contextualize these changes. To assess these patterns,
we compile genealogical and demographic data from 19 communities to examine age-related
variation in relatedness to group members. The study communities vary in terms of settlement
history, subsistence strategies, population, fertility rates, descent rules, and sex biases in dispersal.
Given that we also observe flexibility in the dispersal data of the communities in our sample,
we are not classifying these along traditional binary lines of matrilocal vs patrilocal. Instead, we
explicitly consider the ratio of immigrants in each sex.
Our analysis is framed around the predictions of Johnstone and Cant [1], specifically that
individuals who disperse to new communities initially have few kinship ties but progressively

2. Methods
The data for this study were obtained by the authors via censuses and genealogical interviews
at their respective field sites (Table 1). As noted, the sites exhibit diverse social organization,
demography, and subsistence strategies (see the Electronic Supplementary Material for brief
descriptions of each site). For all living residents in the respective study communities, the authors
compiled data on age, sex, and whether or not individuals are natal members of the community
(Figure 1). This latter variable is subject to interpretation, given the diversity of movement
patterns in human communities. When groupings are geographically and temporally ephemeral,
for example, then it can be challenging to distinguish between natal and non-natal members of
the community. In this sample of sites, the Savanna Pumé of Venezuela exhibit such fluidity, and
few older residents are therefore considered natal members of the community. Analogously, the
Maasai community in this sample is a relatively new settlement that attracted a diverse set of
immigrants, resulting in few older residents who are considered natal members of the community.
More generally, the co-authors had to categorize individuals such as temporary migrants,
children who had relocated with their parents, and foster children. The co-authors attempted
to standardize norms about the categorization of such individuals, generally tending toward
conservatism in the categorization of natal residents. For instance, children of divorced women
who subsequently marry into a new community are generally not considered natal members of
the new community. Therefore, relative to immigrants, the comparability of predictions for natal
residents is less impacted by the fluidity of residence that characterizes several of the study sites.
For each site, the data also includes genealogical relationships that were elicited via interviews
with informants. These genealogies permit the calculation of relatedness among individual
residents of the communities. These calculations employ standard methods for estimating the
coefficient of relatedness from genealogies [17]. For any given dyad, the coefficient is therefore
constrained to lie between 0 and 1, which we anticipate to provide a useful approximation of
genetic similarity. The genealogies from our study sites include at least three generations of depth
for residents, typically permitting us to distinguish cousins and closer genealogical relationships.
Some datasets provide even greater depth, and this varying thoroughness introduces betweensite variation into the sample. In some communities, most notably the matrilineal Mosuo
community, women were often unable to reliably indicate the father of their children. The data
are cross-sectional and represent the composition of the community at a single point in time.
In our primary analysis, we examine the average relatedness of adults to other adult residents
in the community. A focus on adults has parallels to the ethological literature and its attention to
inbreeding avoidance among reproductively mature individuals [18]. Accordingly, we consider
females to be adults when they are 18 years or older and males to be adults when they are 21
years or older. These ages align with evidence that Aché women typically give birth the first time
at 19 years old and that men in natural fertility populations are commonly three years older than
women when their first child is born [19,20].
The analysis is oriented primarily toward illuminating demographic patterns within the
respective study sites. We therefore model average relatedness at each site separately using

exhibit greater relatedness as they have offspring who become members of the group. In this
analysis, the outcome variable is the individuals‘ average relatedness to other community
members [13]. Arguably, because sharing and competition over resources may be particularly
acute within residential clusters of close kin (i.e., sub-units of the larger community), the measure
of community relatedness in this study could be too broad [14]. However, the present compilation
of datasets do not permit the identification of relevant subclusters within the communities, a
methodological consideration that we address in the discussion. Nevertheless, the numerator in
the calculations of average relatedness for a given individual largely reflects the number of close,
co-resident kin in the population. Therefore, in larger communities, although most individuals
may be distantly related to the individual, variability in average relatedness frequently reflects the
presence of close kin and the concomitant opportunities for reproductive conflict and cooperation.

3. Results
Our models examine the average relatedness of individual adults to all other adults in the
community. Model predictions for each site are plotted in Figure 2 (see also Table S1). Before
interpreting predictions for specific sites, it is important to acknowledge that the confidence in
predictions is a reflection of varying sample sizes, both across sites and across demographic
subclasses within sites. In smaller communities, such as the Emberá sites, the predicted slopes
may exhibit high heterogeneity, but there is little confidence that the slopes are conclusively
positive or negative, nor are the slopes for demographic subclasses distinguishable from each
other. The uncertainty relates in part to the small size of these communities, though another
consideration is the high mobility and dispersal rates that characterize these sites. That is not
to say that age-related variation in relatedness cannot be discerned in small communities. The
Savanna Pumé community is also small, but for immigrant females, the model confidently
predicts an increase in relatedness with age. Similarly, low sample sizes within demographic
subclasses can also reduce confidence in the corresponding model predictions. At the patrilineal
Mosuo site, for example, the predicted effects of age are roughly comparable for male and female
immigrants. However, there are substantially more female immigrants than male immigrants.
Consequently, there is relatively more confidence in predictions for the average female immigrant.
In larger communities, individuals exhibit minimal relatedness to most of the other residents.
This lowers the average relatedness among residents, and slopes in these communities typically
seem relatively flat. Because of the larger sample size in communities, however, there is higher
confidence in the predicted means (e.g., the downward trends in Lamalera). On the other hand,
a comparison of the predicted values to the empirical data shows that age and the moderating
effects of sex and natality typically explain only a modicum of the variation in average relatedness
in large communities.
With those caveats in mind, we assess model predictions. Initially, we focus on age-related
increases in average relatedness given the importance of such increases in recent theorizing of
reproductive conflict [1]. For natal residents, increases with age are rare and evident primarily
among males and females in the Mayangna community (Site 3) and the female residents of the
Coastal Afro-Colombian community (Site 4) and the Mexican choyero community (Site 8). For
immigrants, increases are relatively more common and apparent among female immigrants in the
patrilineal communities of Lamalera (Site 12), the patrilineal Mosuo (Site 16), Alakāpuram (Site
¯
17), Tenpat.t.i (Site 18), and Tanna (Site 19). Similar age-related increases for female immigrants

Alternatively, fitting the models as zero-augmented ("hurdle") beta regression models provides qualitatively similar

regression models with the main effects and interaction terms of the three predictor variables: age,
sex, and natality. In some datasets, there were missing values for individuals‘ age and natality.
Typically, these individuals were not permanent residents of the respective communities, so
although their genealogical connections were included in the calculations of dyadic relatedness,
the average relatedness of these individuals were not included in the statistical models. Because
the outcome variable, average relatedness, is bounded to lie between 0 and 1, we use beta
regression models [21]. Since average relatedness for some individuals is zero, we add a constant
(0.0001) to all values for identifiability of model parameters.1 We interpret the models graphically,
plotting their predictions as a function of age interacted with the categorical predictors, sex and
natality. As a supplemental analysis, we model average relatedness among all individuals in the
study communities, including children. We also consider a multilevel analysis of the aggregated
cross-cultural dataset, and we evaluate simpler site-specific models that omit sex as a predictor.
Models are fit with MCMC estimation using functions from the Rstan package [23] and
auxiliary functions from the rethinking package [24]. Weak regularizing priors are implemented
for all model parameters. We do not adopt any particular threshold for statistical significance, but
we make sure to note the effects for which the models consistently predict age-related increases
or decreases in the posterior samples. Data and coding scripts are available as supplemental files.

Supplemental Analyses
For a supplementary analysis of age-related variation in relatedness, we also calculated and
modeled average relatedness among all individuals in the community, including both adults and
children (Figure S1; Table S2). In general, the predictions from these models resemble the models
for relatedness among adults. Noteworthy differences include the flattening of slopes for female
immigrants in Lamalera (Site 12), the Maasai (Site 14), Alakāpuram (Site 17), and Tenpat.t.i (Site
¯
¯
18). This preliminarily suggests that juvenile female immigrants to these communities have more
kin ties (potentially including siblings) than women who arrive as adults. There is also clearer
evidence for age-related increases in relatedness among natal males and females in the Miskito
community (Site 2).
As an additional supplementary analysis, we aggregated and analyzed the cross-cultural
dataset using a multilevel beta regression model. For this analysis, we calculated the proportion
of adult males and females in each community who are natal residents to reflect patrilocal
or matrilocal biases (these quantities are reported in Table 1). These "contextual effects" are
then separately interacted with the individual-level effects, age, sex, and natality. The purpose
of these models is to assess whether matrilocal and patrilocal biases in the communities
moderate the age-related variation that is evident among individuals. Perhaps because they are
overparameterized, these statistical models largely recapitulate our prior findings, revealing few
noteworthy differences that vary as a function of the residence biases that characterize the study
communities (Figure S3). Overall, in these aggregated models, the most consistent difference is
between the average relatedness of natal residents and immigrants. As in the model of Johnstone
and Cant [1], the philopatric sex consistently exhibits higher relatedness to group members.
Finally, we view these analyses primarily as descriptive and exploratory, which initially led
us to consider the full three-way interactions between age, sex, and natality. However, visual
inspection of the predictions in Figure 2 reveals that, conditional on age and natality, there are
few differences between males and females. In the supplemental file, we consider simpler models
that omit sex as a predictor and moderator. These models often receive greater WAIC weight than
the models presented here. In other words, in models that include age and natality as predictors,
sex typically explains little variation in average relatedness (Table S4).

There is also moderate evidence for a positive slope for male immigrants in several additional communities, including the
Mexican choyero community (Site 8), the two Mosuo communities (Sites 10 and 16), and Alakāpuram (Site 17). However, the
¯
low number of male immigrants in these communities precludes strong conclusions about this demographic subgroup.

are evident in two communities characterized by bilateral descent and female philopatry, the
Savanna Pumé (Site 1) and Mayangna (Site 3). For male immigrants, conclusive age-related
increases are evident primarily in the Mayangna community.2 Collectively, these results accord
with expectations that adult immigrants initially have few kin in the community, but then their
relatedness increases over time as they have descendants who join them as residents in the group.
Although prevailing theories focus on age-related increases in relatedness over time, declines
are also interesting because they imply a different set of tradeoffs that merit theoretical attention.
In this sample, declines in average relatedness are evident in several communities. For instance,
the statistical models predict decreases for both natal females and males in Lamalera (Site 12)
and Alakāpuram (Site 17). There is a decrease with age for natal males in Tenpat.t.i and a decrease
¯
¯
for natal females in the smaller Gambian community (Site 9). There is also moderate evidence
for a decline in relatedness with age among natal residents of both sexes in the larger Gambian
community (Site 15). For natal females in Dominica (Site 6), the predicted relationship with
age also trends negative. Among immigrants, however, there is little evidence for decreases in
relatedness with age at any of the sites.

4. Discussion

3

These coefficients of relatedness assume monogamous mating.
Bottom-heavy population pyramids are evident at other study sites (e.g., Maasai) without accompanying age-related
increases in average relatedness, which suggests that other factors can potentially counteract the age-related accumulation of
close kinship ties in expanding populations.

..................................................................

Our analyses show age-related increases in relatedness among immigrants in several of the study
communities that conform to predictions. That is, immigrants of the more commonly dispersing
sex initially have low relatedness, but they accrue more kinship ties as they age and reproduce.
These increases are evident both among immigrant females to societies in which most males
remain in their natal locality (patrilocal communities) and among migrating males in societies
in which most females do not move (matrilocal communities). Not all communities show this
pattern, however, and exceptions occur especially among the Gambian communities and the
small communities with fluid residence patterns and unstable settlement histories. This fluidity
also suggests that traditional labels of matrilocality versus patrilocality do not fully capture the
diversity of migration patterns across human communities. Nevertheless, our results provides
general but not comprehensive support for the prediction that average relatedness of immigrants
to other group members increases as they age. In the following, we discuss additional factors that
were not modeled in this analysis, but that potentially shape the observed variation in kinship
ties across the lifespan.
In this analysis of community relatedness, age is seldom associated with increases in average
relatedness among natal members of the community. A notable exception is the Mayangna site
in Nicaragua. The increase for females in this community is noteworthy because there are biases
toward matrilocality and dispersal by males. This result therefore departs from the conceptual
model advanced by Johnstone and Cant [1], which anticipates that females in such circumstances
would start to show gradual declines in average relatedness as they age. To explain this departure,
a factor to consider is the high fertility rate and population growth in this indigenous Nicaraguan
community. As a matriline expands, older women are increasingly surrounded by daughters (r =
0.5) and nieces (r = 0.25).3 By contrast, for younger females in an expanding population, a high
proportion of their peers are cousins (r = 0.125). To some extent, therefore, the effects of age on
relatedness at this site may be a by-product of the population growth rate, which is considerably
higher than the long-term growth rates that characterized Paleolithic and Neolithic human
populations [25].4 Conversely, decreases in age-related relatedness were observed for natal
residents of several communities that have a lower ratio of younger to older individuals (e.g.,
Alakāpuram), which suggests a potential need to account for demographic nonstationarity in
¯
populations when conducting comparative research on kinship (see [26] for a similar argument).
To explain cross-cultural heterogeneity in relatedness across the lifespan, we argue that there
are likely to be recursions between relatedness and demographic outcomes. In other words, the
fertility, mortality, and dispersal of individuals plausibly vary in response to the presence of kin in
the group. Over time, variation in these outcomes can consequently amplify or reduce relatedness
to other group members. For instance, high average relatedness among older individuals could
indicate greater longevity or fertility due to support from kin, possibly augmented by the
dispersal of individuals with few local kinship ties. Effects of kin on fertility and mortality have
received substantial attention from human behavioral ecologists [27,28].By comparison, dispersal
in human populations has received less attention [29,30]. Studies of non-human mammals
provide evidence of facultative dispersal strategies as a function of the presence and rank of local
kin [31–34]. Comparable anthropological research is empirically challenging, but ethnographers
who conduct longitudinal studies can potentially examine decisions about residence and
dispersal as kin availability fluctuates. In addition, there is an opportunity for theoretical models
and simulations that allow demographic outcomes to vary non-randomly and dynamically in
response to local kinship ties. In particular, whereas the theoretical model of Johnstone and
Cant [1] assumes that all individuals have equivalent probabilities for reproduction, dispersal,

5. Conclusion
In this study, we have considered a cross-cultural sample of sites with heterogeneous patterns
of residence and dispersal. The sample includes sites at which dispersal is biased toward
females (e.g., Tenpat.t.i) or males (e.g., Mayangna). At other sites, including several of the larger
¯
communities, the majority of residents of both sexes are natal members of the community.
There are also sites, including those affected by political disruptions (e.g., Colombia), at which
most adults of both sexes are immigrants. Amid this variability, several study sites feature
increases in relatedness that support prevailing conceptual models. That is, immigrants of
the more commonly dispersing sex tend to show increases in local relatedness as they get
older. There are noteworthy exceptions to this generalization, and given the limitations of the
sample, it is premature to assume that this pattern typifies the majority of human communities.
Furthermore, the demographic variables in this analysis usually explain only a minority of the
5

The dataset for that paper is the same used for the Gambian sites in this paper. Unlike the 2012 paper, however, the present
study depicts results separately for each community rather than modeling individuals in an aggregated dataset.

and mortality, it is beneficial to consider models in which these probabilities depend in part on an
individual’s relatedness to others in the group.
Whereas adult immigrants frequently show increases over time in average relatedness, these
effects were not apparent in the Gambian communities, which were previously analyzed by
Mace and Alvergne [14]. Polygyny is the norm in this setting, and men and their wives live in
extended family compounds. For females at this study site, although there were minimal changes
in average relatedness with age when examining kinship among all members of the community,
their relatedness to other adults in the compound increased as their offspring reached adulthood.5
In other words, whereas the predicted effects were not evident in our community-level analysis,
age-related variation in relatedness to other compound members accords with expectations from
the Johnstone and Cant [1] model.
The discrepancy from the Gambia between relatedness in compounds and communities
provides a cautionary note regarding the interpretation of the results of this study. That is,
reproductive conflict is expected to be acute when individuals are drawing on the same resources.
For example, the killer whales studied by Croft et al. [13] live in pods composed of closely related
individuals who share access to harvested food resources. Ethnographically, there are analogous
examples of human communities that share food resources communally, including indigenous
South Americans who collectively prepare and consume meals as a community [35]. More
commonly, however, residents of human communities share preferentially with subsets of coresidents, including close kin [36–39]. Whereas our analysis helps to substantiate the asymmetries
of relatedness that distinguish young immigrants from older affinal kin, this does not necessarily
imply that these respective individuals are drawing on the same resources. In some settings, it is
plausible that humans facultatively employ behavioral strategies to minimize such reproductive
competition.
In communities that are characterized by discriminative sharing, research would ideally
be directed at the dynamics of kinship within resource-sharing subgroups [40,41]. In most
ethnographic settings, however, there are methodological challenges that hinder such analyses,
particularly the task of distinguishing the boundaries of the subgroups. At most of our study sites,
individuals are organized in small households, usually occupied by a single adult woman (Table
1). As a result, there are minimal opportunities for reproductive competition within females in
the same household. Yet, households often maintain strong cooperative ties to other households
in the community. The pooling of resources among households produces the conditions in which
reproduction competition could be pronounced [1]. A key challenge is that these inter-household
ties are rarely evident when using standard demographic and census methods. As a possible
alternative, a combination of social network surveys [17] and community detection algorithms
[42] could potentially provide opportunities to identify the subgroups in which reproductive
competition is especially relevant for life history strategies.

observed variation in relatedness, which implies opportunities for additional variables to explain
heterogeneity in kin ties. Nevertheless, evidence of the predicted asymmetries in relatedness are
apparent in multiple settings, reinforcing the potential value of additional empirical research on
inter-generational reproductive conflict [5,43–45].
More generally, this cross-cultural study reveals surprisingly diverse relationships between
age and kinship in human communities. These results reinforce perspectives on the flexible
kinship that distinguishes humans from other hominoids [11]. There are pitfalls to reasoning
from ethnographic analogy, but this flexibility motivates a reconsideration of human kinship and
life history strategies. Currently, research is directed toward discerning the social structure of
prehistoric hominins with the assumption that distinctive life history traits evolved partly as
a consequence of this social organization [1]. From this perspective, the emergence of flexible
kinship arrangements in human societies is largely an epilogue that postdates the evolution
of more remarkable human traits. However, the malleability of human kinship enables diverse
adaptive responses to socio-ecological challenges. It is worthwhile to consider scenarios in which
life history traits evolved concurrently with the ability to reside and cooperate with different
classes of kin throughout one’s lifetime.
In terms of female-biased kinship, the theme of this special issue of Philosophical Transactions,
this cross-cultural study underscores the importance of dispersal as a determinant of kin
availability. In most cases, young adult immigrants to new communities have fewer coresident kin than their same-aged natal counterparts. Although female immigrants can maintain
intermittent affiliative ties to family members from their natal communities [46], women who
do not disperse can expect to be surrounded by kin more consistently during their reproductive
years. Therefore, in combination with broader debates about descent rules and daughter-biased
inheritance [47], heterogeneity in female philopatry has a key role to play in evolutionary accounts
of human social organization. A contribution of this study is that dispersal tendencies vary
not only across societies, but also within populations. Dispersal is seldom obligatory, and a
mixture of natal male and female adults is observable in nearly all study communities (see also
[48]). Decisions about dispersal impose tradeoffs on individuals, and society-level variation in
residence rules may be explained in part by unidentified individual-level predictors that capture
heterogeneous effects both across and within the sexes.

For the data on average women per household, the household is considered to be the most relevant resource-sharing units at that locale. For the Gambian study sites, these correspond to multi-family

among adults (males older than 21 and females older than 18). For each respective sex, the percentages in the table reflect the proportion of adults who are natal members of the study community.

Kinship Ties Across the Lifespan in Human Communities
Supplemental Material
Koster et al.

Introduction
This supplemental file contains four sections: (1) Descriptions of the study sites, (2) a supplemental
figure depicting model predictions on a dataset that includes all community residents, not just
adults, (3) the results of a multilevel analysis of the aggregated, cross-cultural data, (4) the results
of site-specific models in which sex is deemphasized as a predictor variable.

Site descriptions
1) Savanna Pumé
The Savanna Pumé are mobile hunter-gatherers indigenous to the llanos (savannas) of west-central
Venezuela. At the last complete census, the Savanna Pumé numbered 670, dispersed in 24 bands
over a 2800 km2 area. Because of the region’s political instability, their geographic isolation and
a poor terrestrial environment, the Savanna Pumé are largely buffered from outside encroachment
and continue to live a hunting and gathering way of life. The bands that are part of this study
have lived in their current foraging area since the mid 1960’s, having migrated from foraging
communities 50 km south along the Cinaruco River. Kin relations and marriage partner exchange
are maintained between these regions, and this fission settlement pattern is an ancestral aspect of
their long-term mobility. The Savanna Pumé are related to the River Pumé, their horticultural
neighbors, with whom they exchange some goods, and infrequently marriage partners. The census
for this study was collected in 2007 as part of a 20-year longitudinal demographic and life history
project.
The Savanna Pumé move 5-6 times a year in response to changes in rainfall and the water
table. During the six-month dry season, food is relatively abundant and subsistence centers on
aquatic resources and wild fruit. When the llanos flood during the wet season, fish are difficult
to locate and the subsistence base shifts to terrestrial game and tubers. Males, both adults and
children, almost exclusively fish and hunt, while women and girls gather tubers and do most of
the food processing. Both males and females collect wild fruit. Male-foraged and female-foraged
foods are both critical to the diet and are widely shared within and across families. Women and
children provide most of the childcare, with males providing about 8%. The Savanna Pumé have
no schools, access to health care, or market foods.
Pumé kinship organization is primarily bilateral. Marriages tend to be endogamous, with 66%
of first marriages and 57% of second marriages occurring among individuals of the same community. Most individuals maintain life-long relationships with their natal bands and multilocality is
common. The Savanna Pumé use kin terms, rather than names, in speaking about and identifying
each other. While about 30% of women and men are polygynously married at some point during
their lives, most marriages are serially monogamous; 20% of adults remarry due to divorce (about
10%) and spousal death (10%). Childcare is fluid. Of the care that in infant receives, 65% comes
from someone other than the mother. Allocaretakers include close kin, more distant bilateral kin,
and nonkin.
Savanna Pumé females marry on average at age 15.1 (SD ±2.5; n=59) and males at age 18.0 (SD
±4.3; n=51). Although first marriages are often arranged, young people are not obliged to accept
these matches, and have autonomy about when and whom they marry. A couple is recognized as
married if they engage in conjugal relations, whereupon they cohabit. Consequently, birth occurs
within the context of marriage and co-residence. Divorce may be instigated by either spouse.
Marriage to non-Pumé has not been documented. Mothers who survive their reproductive careers
1

Koster et al. (Supplemental)

have on average 7.0 ±1.29 live births. However in this high pathogenic and seasonally food-limited
environment, 35% of children born do not survive infancy, and 45% do not survive to reproductive
age. No evidence exists for sex-biased investment in children (mortality; treatment, work load).

2) Miskito
The Miskito community is located in Nicaragua’s Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, part of Central
America’s largest rain forest. The community was settled prior to 1960, vacated during the Contra
War in the 1980s, and occupied again since the early 1990s. Data for this study were collected
in 2013, building on earlier demographic and genealogical research conducted with community
members. In terms of subsistence, the community relies primarily on horticulture with supplements
from hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry. Gold panning and non-local wage labor are the
leading sources of monetary income, which is used to purchase mercantile products. There is a
pronounced sexual division of labor, and men are responsible for most of the agricultural work
whereas women assume most domestic tasks. Both sexes engage in fishing and gold panning,
sometimes cooperatively with spouses or other family members.
As with the Mayangna, descent is traced bilaterally, and Eskimo kinship terms have largely
supplanted a more complex indigenous kinship terminology. Marriages to cousin are largely proscribed. If prospective mates are not present locally, males typically travel to other communities,
often staying with extended kin to facilitate their search. Once married, young couples typically
reside with the woman’s parents for multiple years, often until at least two children have been
born and the couple decides to build a new house nearby. For older women, including formerly
divorced women, there tends to be more flexibility in their residence decisions, and relocating to the
husband’s natal community is not uncommon. In general, couples benefit from the alloparental
investment of extended families, who provide benefits such as childcare and cooperative labor.
At the time of data collection, fertility was high, with total fertility rates exceeding 8 births per
woman. There is little evidence for sex-biased investment in offspring.

3) Mayangna
The Mayangna community is located in Nicaragua’s Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, part of Central
America’s largest rain forest. The community was settled prior to 1960, vacated during the Contra
War in the 1980s, and occupied again since the early 1990s. Data for this study were collected
in 2016 as part of a longitudinal study of subsistence and social support networks. Subsistence
strategies the community revolve around horticulture with supplements from hunting, fishing, and
animal husbandry. Gold panning and non-local wage labor are the leading sources of monetary
income, which is used to purchase mercantile products. A minority of residents maintain salaried
positions as government-funded schoolteachers. There is a pronounced sexual division of labor,
and men are responsible for most of the agricultural work whereas women assume most domestic
tasks. Both sexes engage in fishing and gold panning, sometimes cooperatively with spouses or
other family members.

via government-funded clinics.

4) Coastal Afrocolombians
This community is located on the Pacific coast of Colombia. This community, like many other
communities in the region, has been affected by Colombia’s internal conflicts, and violence from
guerilla and paramilitary groups—especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many current
residents are considered internally displaced persons within Colombia, having settled here after
Page 2

Kinship Ties Across The Lifespan

Koster et al. (Supplemental)

being forced from their natal communities. Data for this study were collected in the winter of
2016, through structured interviews. In terms of subsistence, the community relies primarily on
a mixture of fishing and local wage labor. Hunting, horticulture, and animal husbandry are also
practiced. There is a general sexual division of labor, where men engage in most of the fishing and
women assume most domestic tasks, but exceptions are not infrequent. Relationships are formed
based on personal preferences. Once married, couples typically form their own residential units
near kin. Marriages are not generally stable for long periods of time, with adults over age 45
having a mean of 2.1 total marriages. In general, couples benefit from the alloparental investment
of extended families, who provide benefits such as childcare and material support. At the time of
data collection, fertility was high, with mean fertility exceeding 8.5 births per woman, for those
women age 50 or older.

5) Inland Afrocolombians
This Afrocolombian community is located in the rainforests of western Colombia. This community,
like many other communities in the region, has been affected by Colombia’s internal conflicts,
and violence from guerilla and paramilitary groups—especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Many current residents are considered internally displaced persons within Colombia, having settled
here after being forced from their natal communities. Others, who were once residents of this
community, were displaced during periods of local unrest to other regions inside of Colombia.
Data for this study were collected in the spring of 2017, through structured interviews. In terms of
subsistence, the community relies primarily on a mixture of horticulture and local wage labor (most
frequently as laborers on road construction projects). Hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry are
also practiced, as is small-scale gold panning. There is a general sexual division of labor, where
men engage in most of the horticultural work, and women assume most domestic tasks and do most
of the gold panning, but exceptions are not infrequent. Once married, couples typically form their
own residential units near kin. Marriages are not generally stable for long periods of time, with
adults over age 45 having a mean of 2.4 total marriages—though some stable lifelong partnerships
do occur. In general, couples benefit from the alloparental investment of extended families, who
provide benefits such as childcare and material support. At the time of data collection, fertility
was high, with mean fertility exceeding 7 births per woman, for those women age 50 or older.

6) Dominica
The study community is located on the remote windward coast of Dominica. The community
population includes about 110 households with 400 to 600 residents depending on the time of year
and vagaries of overseas migration from year to year. Inhabitants are a mix of African, Native
American, and European descent. Data for this study were collected between 1993 and 2010 and
supplemented with parish records going back to the 19th Century, and preliminary genealogies
collected by Mark Flinn in 1988. Livelihoods are varied including a mixture of subsistence gardening, fishing, commercial bay oil production, wage labor, and small-scale businesses such as local
dry goods, and rum shops. There are pronounced gender cultures with gender-specific models of
behavior in various domains; however, the division of labor is not strict, and it is mostly due to
requirements for upper body strength for certain tasks. Descent is traced through patrilineages.
However, ego-centric kindreds are also important, and kin related through unnamed matrilineages
cooperate in several spheres. Marriage is an institution in decline. Most conjugal unions consist of
a common-law couple. Conjugal unions are generally fluid with “visiting” relationships commonplace. After the birth of a first child, however, a mother and father may live together for decades
in a stable union. Conjugal families tend to reside neolocally or patrilocally, but many households
are best described as matrifocal in which none of the children has a co-resident father. As of the
year 2004 about 30% of mothers were in long-term conjugal unions. Alloparenting is extensive in
matrifocal and conjugal households. Mean surviving offspring for people over 50 in 2004 was 5.5
(SD=3.0) offspring for women, and 4.6 (SD=3.5) for men. Many women have children with mates
from outside the community. In recent years hormonal contraception has been common.

7) Inland Emberá
This community is located in the rainforests of western Colombia and has been affected by Colombia’s internal conflicts. This small community is composed of several families affected by displacePage 3

ment. Individuals in this community have used the group terms Emberá Chamí and Emberá Katío
when self identifying. Data for this study were collected in spring 2017, through structured interviews. In terms of subsistence, the community relies primarily on a mixture of horticulture, wage
labor (most frequently as laborers on road construction projects), and artisinal crafting (production of glass-bead necklaces). Hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry are also practiced. There is
a general sexual division of labor, where men engage in most of the wage labor, and women assume
most domestic tasks and produce most of the necklaces. Both men and women take part in horticultural activities. Once married, couples typically form their own residential units. Marriages are
generally stable for long periods of time, with married adults over age 30 having a mean of 1 total
marriages. In general, couples benefit from the alloparental investment of extended families, who
provide benefits such as childcare and material support. At the time of data collection, fertility
was high, with mean fertility exceeding 7.5 births per woman, for those women age 30 or older.

8) Los Choyeros of Mexico
The Choyero community is located in a southern portion of the Sierra de La Giganta mountain
range of Baja California Sur, Mexico. The population is descended from Euro-American colonists
who first settled the region alongside Jesuit missionaries in 1741 AD followed by two additional
waves of colonization following the expulsion of the Jesuits (1768 AD) and Mexican independence
(1821 AD). Data for this study were collected in 2017, building on earlier genealogical research
conducted with community members in 2015. Choyero subsistence is primarily based on goat and
cattle husbandry, which is used for meat and cheese production for personal and local consumption, as well as for sale on regional commercial markets. In addition to the sale of animals and
their byproducts, non-local wage labor has become a secondary source of income for most families. Households also supplement their diet through a governmental sponsored food program (i.e.
CONASUPO) and via goods purchased in regional markets (e.g., Las Pocitas, Ciudad Constitución, and La Paz). There is a pronounced sexual division of labor, with men responsible for animal
husbandry and women responsible for domestic tasks and cheese production. Both sexes engage
in artisanal craft production; however, the types of crafts produced differ by sex. Males engage in
leather tanning, metal smithing, and heritage crop production, while women engage in basketry
and crochet.
Descent is traced bilaterally and Eskimo kinship terminology predominates. While cousin
marriage is not proscribed, only a small percentage of the population engages in it. If prospective
mates are not present locally, males and females either wait for a partner to reach marriageable age
locally or they travel to regional festivals and weddings to find a partner. Males also report they
search for mates in distant communities when they travel on horseback looking for their livestock.
Post-marital residence is flexible and young couples may reside with the groom or bride’s family,
near the groom or bride’s family, or in a separate location altogether. However, historically it was
common for young couples to reside with the groom’s family following marriage and currently,
many males state a preference for this outcome. Although there is a strong independent ethos
centered at the ranch-level, extended family members and neighbors, who are often kin, provide
childcare and cooperative labor. Fertility has been on the decline for several decades and there is
little evidence for sex-biased investment in offspring.

9) The Gambia, 2
The data from this rural community in Gambia come from a longitudinal dataset collected by
the UK Medical Research Council, initiated by the late Sir Ian McGregor in 1949. He studied
four villages in total, collecting demographic and some anthropometric and health data on all
inhabitants for nearly 25 years. Until 1975, this population lived in a largely ‘natural fertility’
and ‘natural mortality’ environment, albeit with some medical care available on occasions when
McGregor and others were residing in the village. Deaths due to malaria and other infections
were commonplace, with only 45% of children surviving to their fifth birthday. After 1975, a
permanent medical centre opened in one of the villages and mortality declined markedly. Modern
contraception was also introduced, and has gradually been adopted. The data in this compilation
focus primarily on the period 1950-1975, when mortality was still high. Compounds were areas
where people lived together in a cluster of households. Compounds often comprise a patrilineal
group (fathers, brothers and sons and their spouses and children), although more distant relatives
or unrelated families may reside in the same compound. The society is polygynous and co-wives
Page 4

Kinship Ties Across The Lifespan

Koster et al. (Supplemental)

usually inhabit the same compound. Divorce and remarriage do occur, in which case women move
compounds (but often leave weaned children in their natal compound with their patrilineal kin).
However compound residents can include more distantly related or unrelated families. Because
these compounds are matters of historical record, we do not know exactly how individuals shared
work on fields or how they shared food within these compounds or who owned what land. Women
often remained in their husbands’ households for life, but occasionally started to reproduce with
another man in another compound even if their first husband was alive, at which point we assumed
divorce and remarriage and relocation to the new husband’s compound had occurred. Women do
not remain single for long in this society, and on widowhood remarry quickly, often marrying their
late husband’s brother through the levirate system. Note that this paper includes data from two of
the communities studied by McGregor, and the same description is used for both.

10) Matrilineal Mosuo
The Mosuo, numbering approximately 40,000, live in the Hengduan mountains in the foothills
of the Himalayas in Southwest on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces. Ethnographic
accounts suggest that they migrated to this area from northern China before the thirteenth century.
There are approximately 18,000 Mosuo residing in the Yongning Basin in Yunnan province where
we performed our study. Normatively, the Yongning Mosuo are matrilineal, conferring descent
and inheritance to daughters and their children, and natalocal. They are known for their lack of
institutionalized marriages, engaging instead in “walking marriage”, whereby women engage in nonexclusive, impermanent romantic partnerships with men from other clans. Such arrangements are
still common, but bilateral families and institutional marriages have become increasingly popular
following the rapid development of ethnic tourism beginning in the late 20th century.
The Yongning Mosuo traditionally rely on agriculture and animal husbandry, including a heavy
reliance on domesticated pigs, cattle, and water buffalo, for subsistence. A relative abundance of
farmlands (when compared with neighboring areas) allows for rice cultivation, but yields are not
high due to the high elevation at which the Mosuo reside (upwards of 2,650 meters). There is
a strong sexual division of labor in the Yongning Mosuo. Specifically, women engage in most of
the day-to-day tasks associated with planting and harvesting crops, while men are involved in less
frequent bouts of heavy labor associated with home construction and agricultural activities. Some
families supplement household income by working in tourist towns nearby; some work as drivers
and tour guides while some engage in day labor in construction sites. Data for this study were
collected in 2017 and 2018.

11) Maya
Maya subsistence farmers live in the tropical forests of the Puuc region of the Yucatan Peninsula,
Mexico. The village was established in its current location about 100 years ago when dispersed
local hamlets aggregated at two abandoned colonial wells following the Caste Wars. Most villagers
are descendants from these few founder families. The census for this study was collected in 2017,
as part of an ongoing longitudinal demographic and life history project. When first documented
in the early 1990s, the population was 300, and today is about 550. The majority of the Maya diet
comes from of maize, and to a lesser extent from beans, squash, domesticated and hunted animals.
Few market foods are consumed, those that are largely in the form of soda. Electricity, running
water, a rudimentary health clinic, primary schools, mechanized farming and cash cropping have
been introduced over the past decade due to the recent road construction linking this isolated
community to the region. In 2017 most households made their living from farming. Wage work is
available only outside the community, and few household heads (15%) are full time wage laborers.
Recent regional market access has been accompanied by a change in the division of labor. While
adult nonnursing women and children used to spend about 10% to 15% of their time, respectively,
in agricultural labor, women in particular spend much less time in the fields or forest following the
introduction of mechanized farming. While mothers and children provide most of the childcare,
because agricultural labor is more expedient, men now spend more time at home caring for their
children and helping with domestic tasks. Both unmarried men and women engage in unskilled
wage labor. However, at marriage, women quit these jobs, while men do not necessarily. Most of
the few skilled wage laborers live outside the village.
The Maya trace descent bilaterally, and maintain close relations with their natal families
throughout their lives. At birth, children are given two traditional Maya surnames, the first is
Page 5

Kinship Ties Across The Lifespan

Koster et al. (Supplemental)

their mother’s paternal last name, and the second their father’s paternal last name. Neither males
nor females change their names when they marry. The ejido land tenure system, which was instituted following the Mexican Revolution, proscribes that agricultural land be communally held,
and is not inheritable. Because there is also little heritable material wealth, inheritance rules are
not well established. Upon marriage, young couples frequently reside with the husband’s family
for some years before they cut their own fields, have the resources to build and maintain an independent household. However, there are many exceptions to this pattern of transient patrilocality.
Most villagers marry endogamously, though in-marriage and out-marriage is increasing. The Maya
are monogamous, with no incidence of divorce or unwed motherhood recorded in the 100 years of
reproductive histories. This, however, is likely to change with market integration. Most childcare
and domestic work occur within biological families (mother, father, children), although agricultural
profits, labor and other economic gains are shared across extended families in 33% of households
(extended families are usually composed of a biological family and an elderly parent, or young
recently married sons). At the community level, mean completed fertility slightly declined over
the past 20 years from 7.5 to 6.1 children. However, within-population variance has significantly
increased. There is no evidence (birth weight, education, work load, or survivorship) for sex-biased
investment in offspring.

12) Lamalera
Lamalera is a fishing and sea hunting community located on the south coast of the island of Lembata in southeast Indonesia. In 2006 (the year these data were collected) the resident population
numbered 1,227 people in 317 households (excluding two historically separate agricultural hamlets now under Lamaleran village administration). The village is famous for being one of the
last remaining traditional whaling societies in tropical waters. Villagers grow little food of their
own; instead women trade marine resources for agricultural produce from the shifting cultivators
of the interior. Patrilineal kinship (with Omaha terminology) is the key organizing principle for
boat-owning corporate groups and hunting crew formation. Marriage was traditionally exogamous
by lineage and endogamous within the village, with clans related in permanent wife-giving and
wife-taking relationships to each other in an asymmetric marriage alliance system. Since the mid20th Century, this system seems to have broken down under the influence of the Catholic Church,
though marriage still defines relationships of social dominance and deference between clans and
individuals. Post-marital residence was traditionally virilocal though the Church successfully promoted a shift to neolocal residence beginning in the 1930s. When marriages take place between
communities it is nearly always the woman that moves to her husband’s village.
Lamalera was the site of the first Catholic mission on Lembata, and consequently the site of the
first schools. At the time of the study, the village was the site of two elementary schools, and the
only junior high school on the south coast of the island. The latter attracted a handful of students
from other villages, who stayed either in a small dormitory or as borders with local families. The
best students may go on to high school in the main town of Lewoleba on the north side of the
island. Both junior high and high school provide opportunities for young people to meet potential
spouses from other communities. Trade trips accompanying mothers into the interior or to the
weekly market town may provide additional opportunities. The schools themselves are staffed
in part by outsiders from other communities, who are sometimes already married with families
of their own. Outside-born adult women tend to have married into the village and permanently
reside there. Outside-born adult men tend to be either temporary residents working as teachers,
or men born outside the village to Lamaleran parents who later returned.

13) Coastal Emberá
This community is located on the Pacific coast of Colombia. It has been heavily affected by
Colombia’s internal conflicts and displacement—with a large fraction of this population being
internally displaced residents, forced from their natal communities by violence. Individuals in
this community primarily use the group term Emberá Chamí when self identifying. Data for
this study were collected in winter 2016, through structured interviews. In terms of subsistence,
the community relies primarily on a mixture of horticulture and wage labor. Hunting, fishing,
and animal husbandry are also practiced. There is a general sexual division of labor, where men
engage in most of the wage labor, and women assume most domestic tasks. Both men and women
take part in horticultural activities. Once married, couples typically form their own residential
Page 6

units. Marriages are generally stable for long periods of time, with married adults over age 30
having a mean of 1.4 total marriages. In general, couples benefit from the alloparental investment
of extended families, who provide benefits such as childcare and material support. At the time
of data collection, fertility was high, with mean fertility exceeding 8 births per woman, for those
women age 30 or older.

14) Maasai
The Maasai community is located in the Serengeti ecosystem within Simanjiro District in northern
Tanzania. The community was recognized as a sub-village in the 1990’s although the area is a
traditional grazing area for Maasai herds. Data from this study were collected in 2017 as part of
a cross-cultural study of social networks and wealth. Subsistence patterns within the community
remain centered around maintaining a pastoralist livelihood although the community has expanded
reliance on crops, particularly maize and beans. A small number of men also participate in the
Tanzanite trade and non-local wage labor, mostly as security guards for banks and safari companies.
The division of labor is pronounced with men tending livestock and participating in business affairs
while women perform most domestic tasks although women are increasingly working in crop fields.
Descent is traced patrilineally with traditional kinship terms generally similar to the Omaha system.
Polygyny is still commonly practiced with marriages structured by patrilocal residence and clan
exogamy. Once married, young couples usually reside in bomas with brothers of the husband.
Young divorced women usually return to the boma of their father and older divorced women go to
their brother’s boma. Widowed women often stay at the boma although remarriage is uncommon
in older women. Alloparental investment is common in childcare and cooperative labor, largely
provided by co-wives and wives of husband’s brothers in the boma. At time of collection, fertility
rates among Maasai women remained high with total fertility rates around 6 per woman. There is
some evidence of sex-biased investment in offspring with males completing primary and secondary
schooling at a considerably higher rate although sex ratios favor females.
Broadly speaking, Maasai pastoralist communities are more recently established compared to
neighboring farming populations given their history of transhumance. Consequently, it is common
for male heads of Maasai bomas to be born outside of the community where they currently reside.
Decisions to settle on a particular community depended upon several factors, including availability
of forage and water, family ties, and more recently, access to villages. In addition, many Maasai
communities were established relatively more recently due to pressures from Tanzanian government policies that forbid inhabitation/use of national parks (e.g., Serengeti National Park), which
resulted in the relocation of Maasai across vast regions of northern Tanzania. Several families in
the current community were those pressured to relocate, either directly or indirectly from population pressure in other regions. Furthermore, the area does not contain large amounts of foraging
areas for livestock so the area has attracted households willing to invest more in agriculture. The
decision for a household to focus on agriculture meant that some bomas became separated with
other boma members and related bomas moving/staying in areas with better forage and water.

15) The Gambia, 1
The data from this rural community in Gambia come from a longitudinal dataset collected by
the UK Medical Research Council, initiated by the late Sir Ian McGregor in 1949. He studied

or unrelated families may reside in the same compound. The society is polygynous and co-wives
usually inhabit the same compound. Divorce and remarriage do occur, in which case women move
compounds (but often leave weaned children in their natal compound with their patrilineal kin).
However compound residents can include more distantly related or unrelated families. Because

these compounds are matters of historical record, we do not know exactly how individuals shared
work on fields or how they shared food within these compounds or who owned what land. Women
often remained in their husbands’ households for life, but occasionally started to reproduce with
another man in another compound even if their first husband was alive, at which point we assumed

the communities studied by McGregor, and the same description is used for both.

16) Patrilineal Mosuo
Approximately 4,000 Mosuo live in the area surrounding Labai Township, a mountainous region at
slightly lower elevation, but with far steeper terrain, to the west of the Yongning basin. The Labai
Mosuo are said to have migrated from Yongning in search for gold by the Jinsha River. Unlike
their Yongning counterparts, they practice patrilineal descent, patrilocal post-marital residence,
and ultimogeniture. Institutional marriage is the norm and cross-cousin marriage is not infrequent.
Some Mosuo reason that the rugged mountainous landscape and distance between villages have
prevented frequent spousal visitations and hence deterred natalocal residential arrangements that
correspond to walking marriage.
Population and farmland in Labai (amounting to less than 5000 acres in total) are sparsely
distributed along the steep mountainous terrain. The Labai Mosuo keep pigs and farm cash crops
such as walnuts, peppercorns, and tobacco. Nevertheless, due to the limited size of their farms,
many import rice and animal fodder from Yongning. Labai was accessible only on horseback
before a road was built in 2011 and its infrastructure (including availability of private toilets and
electricity) has only developed significantly in the last several years. The Mosuo population in
Labai declined from 4,319 in 2006 to 4,199 in 2015 (official statistics), due in part to out-migration
in search for economic opportunities. Data for this study were collected primarily in 2018, with
supplementary information drawn from a demographic survey conducted in 2017.

17) Alakāpuram
¯

The village of Alakāpuram (a pseudonym) is located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, near
the Vaigai River.¯ The village is many generations old, well beyond the memory of residents, and
occupied continuously. Data for this study were primarily collected as part of a demographic
household census between 2011 and 2013, and further updated in 2017. Inclusion in the dataset
used here reflects residence in 2017. Residents include a mix of different religious (Hindu, Catholic,
and Protestant) and caste groups (primarily Scheduled Castes (esp. Pal.l.ar and Paraiyar) and some
Backward Castes (esp. Yātavar and Tēvar)). Two hamlets are at slight remove¯ from the main
village, with one occupied exclusively by Hindu Yātavars, and the other primarily by Protestant
(Church of South India) Paraiyars.
Most residents engage in¯ a combination of agriculture and wage labor. Most people grow rice
paddy, and so are reliant on irrigation waters being released upstream (which does not materialize
in some years). A few wealthier families have bore wells and grow other crops such as sugar cane,
bananas, cotton, and vegetables. Wage labor work includes construction, wood collection (for coal
factories), and participation in a government program that guarantees 100 days of work to each
household. In most households, all adults work. Wages for women (even when doing comparable
work) are often slightly lower than what men earn. Government programs provide many basic
necessities and services (basic foodstuffs, medical care, free lunches for students, etc.).
Inheritance of most property and land is patrilineal, though daughters receive substantial transfers from their parents at marriage. Marriages are almost always arranged by parents and are
within the same caste group. Close kin marriages (especially to cross cousins (mother’s brother’s
children or father’s sister’s children) or maternal uncles) are traditionally preferred. Increasingly,
however, “stranger” marriages (still arranged, with connections typically made through kin and
close acquaintances) are becoming common. Residence is generally patrilocal, with new married
couples now typically establishing a new household near the husband’s parents (co-residence does
sometimes occur, though resources are not typically pooled). A significant number of married
women end up residing in their natal village, however; this is usually because they have married
locally, or because of employment (either the wife is living in her natal village while her husband
works elsewhere (often abroad), or both are residing there because of better proximity to work
Page 8

opportunities). Divorce does occur, and though remarriage is seen as being unlikely, it does happen. The village has undergone the demographic transition, with women now typically having two
children (assisted by active government family planning policies).

The village of “Tenpat.t.i” (a pseudonym) neighbors “Alakāpuram” in the Indian state of Tamil
¯
¯
Nadu, near the Vaigai
River. The village is many generations
old, well beyond the memory of
residents, and occupied continuously. Data for this study were primarily collected as part of a
demographic household census between 2011 and 2013, and further updated in 2017. Inclusion
in the dataset used here reflects residence in 2017. Residents include a mix of different religious
(Hindu and Catholic) and caste groups (primarily Backward Castes (esp. Yātavar, Tēvar, and
Ācāri) and some Scheduled Castes (esp. Pal.l.ar and Aruntatiyar)).
As in “Alakāpura,” most residents engage in a combination of agriculture and wage labor. Most
people grow¯ rice paddy, and so are reliant on irrigation waters being released upstream (which
does not materialize in some years). A few wealthier families have bore wells and grow other
crops such as sugar cane, bananas, cotton, and vegetables. Wage labor work includes construction,
wood collection (for coal factories), and participation in a government program that guarantees
100 days of work to each household. In most households, all adults work. Wages for women
(even when doing comparable work) are often slightly lower than what men earn. Government
programs provide many basic necessities and services (basic foodstuffs, medical care, free lunches
for students, etc.).
Inheritance of most property and land is patrilineal, though daughters receive substantial transfers from their parents at marriage. Marriages are almost always arranged by parents and are
within the same caste group. Close kin marriages (especially to cross cousins (mother’s brother’s
children or father’s sister’s children) or maternal uncles) are traditionally preferred. Increasingly,
however, “stranger” marriages (still arranged, with connections typically made through kin and
close acquaintances) are becoming common. Residence is generally patrilocal, with new married
couples now typically establishing a new household near the husband’s parents (co-residence does
sometimes occur, though resources are not typically pooled). A significant number of married
women end up residing in their natal village, however; this is usually because they have married
locally, or because of employment (either the wife is living in her natal village while her husband
works elsewhere (often abroad), or both are residing there because of better proximity to work opportunities). Divorce does occur, and though remarriage is seen as being unlikely, it does happen.
These villages have undergone the demographic transition, with women now typically having two
children (assisted by active government family planning policies).

19) Tanna
Tanna is an island in the Melanesian nation of Vanuatu. Tannese data were collected from Ikakahak,
the largest village in the Green Point region, located in the southwest of the island, during June
and July of 2018. Green Point was settled prior to historical records, but pieces of oral histories
discussed during data collection indicate that it was settled some time in the 1700s-1800s by
migrants from further north. Tanna itself was first settled circa 420 B.C.E. Green Point has played
an important role in Tannese history, because it was there that John Frum appeared and started
his traditionalist movement; local elders say that the region was named “Green Point” by John
Frum himself.
Subsistence is based primarily on horticulture in nearby gardens, supplemented by occasional
meat from domesticates and foraged meat from wild birds and shellfish. The primary subsistence
crops are manioc, yam, and taro root, with manioc predominating because it can be grown yearround. Since the introduction of imported goods, rice has also become a staple of the local diet.
Male heads of house are typically responsible for tending gardens, often in cooperation with their
patrilineal male relatives. It is common for women to assist their husbands in agricultural labor,
and women with dead or absent husbands maintain their own gardens.
Residence is virilocal and descent and inheritance are patrilineal, though there is significant
flexibility in kinship, including via adopting children of patrikin. It is nonetheless common for
women to maintain cooperative relationships with their natal kin. A historical preference for crosscousin marriage has recently been replaced by love marriage. Polygyny is allowed, but the vast
majority of marriages of marriages are monogamous, and all marriages in the sampled community
Page 9

Kinship Ties Across The Lifespan

Koster et al. (Supplemental)

are monogamous. Affairs and divorce are common, and when a relationship dissolves the children
usually go with the mother, who returns to live with her parents or brothers.

Aggregated Analysis
In our main analysis, we separately modeled the data from each study community. The rationale for this modeling approach is that our cross-cultural sample is relatively small (n = 19) and
not necessarily representative of ethnographically documented societies. Therefore, attempts to
generalize from the sample to an "average" human society are potentially misleading. Having
emphasized those important caveats, we consider additional statistical models in which data from
all communities are combined for an aggregated analysis. This analysis considers the extent to
which matrilocal and patrilocal tendencies within communities affect the age-related variation in
relatedness among individuals. For a practical example, this implies that immigrant females in
matrilocal societies may exhibit different changes in relatedness with age when compared to immigrant females in patrilocal societies. We examine these questions by including site-level averages
as "contextual effects." For each study site, we therefore calculate the percentage of adults of each
sex who reside in their natal community (these same quantities appear in Table 1 in the main
manuscript). We then consider multilevel beta regression models in which these contextual effects
are included as predictors of adults’ relatedness to other adults in their respective communities.
Hereafter these variables are described as percent born female and percent born male. They are
included in statistical models both as main effects and as moderators in interaction terms that also
include the three primary individual-level variables, age, sex, and natality.

where the outcome variable is the average relatedness of adult individual i to other adults in
community k. The model includes four effects that vary by study site, including a varying intercept
(vk ) and varying slopes for age (fik ), sex (gik ), and natality (hik ). In addition to the main effects,
there are two separate four-way interaction terms between percent born female and percent born
male and the individual-level main effects for age, sex, and natality status. Finally, a variable for
the number of adults in the community is included given the expectation that larger communities
exhibit lower average relatedness.
In addition to the above model, we also specified three additional beta regression models of the
aggregated dataset: (1) a base model that excludes the contextual effects altogether, (2) a model
that includes the contextual effects as "main effects" but not in interaction terms, (3) a highly
parameterized model that includes the five-way interaction of the three individual-level variables
and the two sex-specific contextual effects. The random effects structure remains constant across
all of these models.

Table S3: WAIC comparisons of four statistical models of the aggregated cross-cultural dataset.
Lower WAIC values indicate models with greater generalizability. Within the comparison set, a
model’s weight is an estimated probability that will generate the best predictions on new datasets.
Four models are included in the comparison set with varying use of the contextual effects, percent
born female and percent born male (referenced in the table as "effects," though note that the
individual-level predictors and their interactions are included in all models). The code and data
to reproduce these models are included as supplemental files.

We use WAIC comparisons to evaluate the fit of these models (Table S1). These comparisons
suggest that the most basic model, which lacks the contextual effects of percent born female and
percent born male, receives the strongest support. The only other model that receives any WAIC
weight is the model that includes the contextual effects only as main effects, not in interaction
terms. Overall, this evidence suggests that age-related variation in relatedness among individuals
is evidently not moderated by the proportion of males and females who are natal residents of the
communities.
Although the model receives minimal statistical support, we plot the predictions of the model
notated above in order to visually assess the evident lack of moderating effects (Fig S2). We
organize our plots to align with the quantitative model of Johnstone and Cant (2010), depicting
predictions at high and low combinations of male and female dispersal, respectively. Within any
particular combination, these plotted predictions generally show few differences in the age-related
variation of immigrants.1 We hesitate to draw further inferences from these predictions in part
because of the small sample size of communities. For instance, the predictions for the "High
Female, Low Male" combination largely recapitulate the patterns in the Miskito and Mayangna
communities. In the main text, we noted that the age-related increases for both immigrants and
natals in those communities seemingly stem from high population growth rates that our statistical
models do not address. Future analyses of age-related variation in kinship ties would benefit from
the inclusion of predictor variables that account for demographic heterogeneity across sites. It is
less clear how statistical models might account for communities that are characterized by unstable
settlement histories, such as the Maasai and coastal Colombian sites in the present sample.
1 Note

that the model with the five-way interaction terms generated qualitatively similar predictions.

Figure S2: Model predictions from an analysis of the aggregated dataset. The four panels depict
varying combinations of high and low percent born female and percent born male, which moderate
the individual-level predictors. For high levels of these variables, predictions are based on a value
of 0.75. For low levels, predictions are based on a value of 0.25. The predictions further assume a
population size of 100 adults, and predictions are based only on the fixed effects. In other words,
these predictions assume a society with values of 0 for all of the random effects. Shaded intervals
depict 89% confidence intervals around model predictions.

Simplifying Models and Sex as a Predictor
In our main models, we had included sex (coded as 1 for males) as a main effect and as a moderator
of the other individual-level covariates, It is evident from the posterior predictions plots in Figure
2, however, that the predictions of males and females overlap considerably. Within many study
sites, that is, male and female immigrants exhibit similar age-related variation, as do male and
female natal residents. This led us to consider additional statistical models for each site. Compared
to the models that are depicted in Figure 2 and reported in Table S1, we specified models that
(1) excluded sex altogether as a predictor, and (2) included sex as a main effect, but not as a
moderator of the other terms in the model (it was included only as a main effect, in other words).
We then compared these models using WAIC (Table S4).
These models show that sex often explains little of the variation in average relatedness to other
adults in the community. For 12 of the 19 study sites, the models with the greatest WAIC weight
are those in which sex is omitted altogether as a predictor. And across all site, the inclusion of
sex either as a main effect or a moderator rarely has a substantial impact on model fit. That is,
even for sites like the Mayangna (site 3), although the greatest weight is evident for the full model
presented in the main text, this model is largely indistinguishable from the other models presented
here. (These comparisons rely on the heuristic that superior models are distinguished by a WAIC
score that differs from scores of other models by 2 or more.) In summary, in models that include
age, natality status, and the interaction of those effects, then the inclusion of sex as a predictor
seemingly explains little variation in average relatedness. Note that we did not consider models
that omit other predictors and/or their interactions, though it is possible that other statistical
models would compare favorably to those we have presented.
Table S4: WAIC comparisons of three candidate models for each study site. Like the models
presented in Figure 2, there is a separate set of models for each study site. In the "Sex Absent"
models, sex is omitted altogether as a predictor, leaving only parameters for age, natality status,
and their interaction. In the "Sex Main" models, sex is added only as a main effect (these models
differ from the "Sex Absent" models only by a single parameter). Bold values signify the model
that receives the strongest support at each site, though we note again that differences between
most models are modest.
