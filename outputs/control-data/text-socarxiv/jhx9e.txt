Abstract
Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are behaviourally defined syndromes where
the etiology and pathophysiology are not very well understood. If the child has been diagnosed
with autism, parents already face special behavioural challenges. What makes ASD even more
difficult, are the many other medical health issues that often arise in this population.
The purpose of this article is to summarise the latest understanding of autism’s commonly
associated physical and mental health conditions.
Methods: An analysis of relevant literature, sources from the internet and published literature,
personal experience and observations of the author.
Recent findings: Autism is a disorder of the whole body. It is often in co-morbidity with:
epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, neuro-inflammation and immunological disorders, asthma,
eczema, sleep disturbances, eating and feeding disorders, food allergies, attention deficit and
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), headaches, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression,
schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability,
nonverbal learning disorder, motor clumsiness, Tourette syndrome, sensory problems, tuberous
sclerosis, oxidative stress, acquired mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities.
Many of the issues outlined here can overlap each other.
Conclusions: Improved understanding of the underlying pathology of ASD and associated
conditions, and the development of a common purpose across multiple treating sites, can
improve the consistent and coordinated healthcare of children with autism. There is need for
the development of improved strategies for delivering effective health education and healthcare
to this large population. Improving the ability of these persons to lead relatively independent
lives has a great economic impact.

Trajkovski V. Health condition in persons with autism spectrum disorders

Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a
heterogeneous
group
of
complex
neurodevelopmental conditions apparent in early
childhood, characterised by persistent deficits in
social communication and social interaction and
restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour,
interests or activities (APA, 2013). Autism is not
a disease, but it is a disorder which affects the
immature, developing brain. It is obvious, that
for many people, autism is a whole-body
disorder. Its frequent co-morbidities include
seizures, gastrointestinal disorders, sleep
disturbances, eating and feeding challenges,
attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), anxiety, depression, schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder (Croen, 2015). Various
markers of abnormal brain development (e.g.
minor and major congenital anomalies) and risk
factors for brain damage (e.g. pregnancy and
birth complications) were also described in the
literature. Parallel developments in medical
diagnostics have also lead to improvements in
the detection and diagnosis of medical
conditions, so the prevalence of these conditions
in individuals with ASD has also increased
(Bolton, 2009). Genetic research is delving into
the biological causes of autism-associated health
conditions. This is part of a new avenue of autism
research aimed at identifying the many
biological subtypes of autism and developing
personalised treatments and supports (Autism
Speaks, 2017).
The prevalence of ASD has been rising as the
definition has evolved and awareness has
increased. The most recent estimate suggests
that 1 in 68 children in the United States are
on the autism spectrum and that number
increases in boys to 1 in 42 (CDC, 2016). To
date, however, very little is known about
ASD in adults, including their health status
and healthcare needs (Mandell, 2013).
Autism is relatively difficult to diagnose
especially in developing countries. In the
Republic of Macedonia, no services exist for
adults with ASD. Based on the incidence of
autism, there is an increased likelihood that
healthcare providers will have children with
autism in their practice. Current research
estimates that a full-time pediatrician will

have at least 20 to 25 patients on the autism
spectrum (Carbone, 2013).
Comorbid conditions may be markers for
underlying pathophysiology and request a more
varied treatment approach. Developmental,
psychiatric, and neurologic disorders frequently
co-occur in children with autism spectrum
disorders and may have a significant impact on
the identification, treatment needs, functional
status, and progress of children with ASD
(Gillberg & Billstedt, 2000).
In one study which examines the prevalence of
co-occurring conditions across multiple organ
systems among a large sample of adults with
ASD, Kohane et al. reported a higher prevalence
of epilepsy, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel
disease, central nervous system (CNS)/cranial
anomalies, diabetes mellitus type I, muscular
dystrophy, and sleep disorders among autism
cases compared to controls. This study
population was restricted to young adults <35
years of age. They found: 19.44% of ASD
patients had epilepsy as compared to 2.19% in
the overall hospital population, 2.43% of ASD
with schizophrenia vs. 0.24% in the hospital
population, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
0.83% vs. 0.54%, bowel disorders (without IBD)
11.74% vs. 4.5%, CNS/cranial anomalies
12.45% vs. 1.19%, diabetes mellitus type I
(DM1) 0.79% vs. 0.34%, muscular dystrophy
0.47% vs 0.05%, sleep disorders 1.12% vs.
0.14% (Kohane et al., 2012).
The functional status of adults with ASD also
remains poorly understood. In general, adaptive
functioning in adults with neurodevelopmental
disorders declines with advancing age in
different ways from the general population, but
this has not been examined in adults with ASD
(Sullivan et al., 2011). Many adults with ASD
develop new skills with age that allow them to
thrive independently throughout life. Others
require more supportive environments.
Examining functional status is critical towards
improving adaptive functioning and supporting
independence for different cohorts of adults with
ASD. Kogan et al. found that children with ASD
had more difficulties accessing necessary care
and had more unmet needs than other children
with special healthcare needs. They also noted
greater problems related to employment and

family financial concerns. The documented
increase in healthcare expenses, gaps in
treatment, and effects on family well-being call
for more attention to the major medical concerns
of children with ASD (Kogan et al., 2008).
The purpose of this article is to summarise the
latest understanding of autism’s commonly
associated physical and mental health conditions.

Methods
A search of the two electronic data bases
PubMed and Google Scholar was performed in
order to identify published papers from the field
of health condition and autism from September
10th until October 12th 2018. The following
keyword descriptors were used in combination:
“health condition” and “autism”, or “medical
condition” and “autism”, or “co-morbid
disorders” and “autism”. The search was
systematically conducted on journal articles in
academic peer-reviewed journals and was not
limited by year. A total number of 94 articles
were selected for analysis from which 33 were in
the Google Scholar database and 61 were in the
PubMed database. From this 47 articles (50%)
have been cited as relevant literature in this paper.
The majority of the articles focus on medical
conditions which are associated with ASD.

Recent findings
Improved awareness of concurrent medical
conditions associated with autism can increase
the medical professional’s index of suspicion
when evaluating a child with autism (Celia,
Freysteinson, & Frye, 2016).
Medical conditions in autism can be divided into
two categories such as: general and specific. The
category general consists of disorders that do not
have specific cause (intellectual disability and
epilepsy). The category specific consists of
distinct conditions such as: Fragile X syndrome,
tuberous sclerosis, Down syndrome, etc.
(Ghaziuddin, 2018). In the following text are
descriptions of several examples of comorbid
medical conditions that can be easily
misdiagnosed in people with autism.

1. Somatic comorbidities
1.1. Autism and Epilepsy

Epilepsy is one of the most common medical
conditions associated with ASD. Epilepsy can
begin at any point in the lifetime of someone
with ASD but typically signs will show up by
adolescence.
Epilepsy affects a 5% to 46% of people who
have autism, compared to an estimated 1 to 2%
of the general population (Spence and Schneider,
2009). In one of our previous studies, we found
that convulsions as a symptom presented in 14%
of 102 subjects with ASD (Trajkovski, 2014).
The autism-epilepsy overlap appears to be most
common among people who also have
intellectual disability (Autism Speaks, 2017).
Intellectual disability with challenges in
everyday function affects an estimated 32% of
those who have autism (Christensen, et al., 2016).
While there are still not enough studies to
conclusively determine why seizures are so
common, scientists have found some evidence to
support various scenarios. The risk for epilepsy
appears to be higher in those children who
experienced a regression of language skills
before the age of three. The largest group at risk
for seizure disorders appears to be those
individuals diagnosed with intellectual disability
in addition to ASD. Seizures appear to be more
common in children who have used
antipsychotic medications as part of their ASD
treatment (Besag, 2018).
Seizures can begin at any age, though research
has identified two peaks in onset among children
with autism in the preschool years and again in
adolescence. Characteristic symptoms include:
unexplained staring spells, stiffening of muscles,
and involuntary jerking of limbs. Other lessspecific symptoms can include: sleepiness or
sleep disturbances, marked and unexplained
irritability or aggressiveness, and regression in
normal development.
Epilepsy in autism is treated by combinations of
medications and educational and social
interventions. Treatment with medications, such
as anti-epileptic drugs, has often been associated
with improvement in behaviour and language in
this population (Frye et al., 2010). Referral to a
child neurologist who has experience with
children with autism would be appropriate.
Though diet has not been shown as a factor
causing seizures, some doctors have used a

115

Trajkovski V. Health condition in persons with autism spectrum disorders

ketogenic diet to significantly reduce and even
eliminate seizures. This diet consists of
increasing fat intake to four times the intake of
carbs and proteins. Doctors still aren’t sure why
this works but according to the Epilepsy
Foundation, up to 2/3 of patients have found
some success with the diet (Autism Speaks,
2017).
1.2. Sleep disorders
Children with ASD have a significantly high rate
of sleep disorders. It has been reported that up to
80% have some issue with sleep. The two most
common problems are difficulty falling asleep
and waking up repeatedly. Some children with
ASD seem programmed to wake up early
regardless of what time they go to sleep
(Krakowiak et al., 2008). Sleep disorders are a
common occurrence in the child with autism,
compared to the non-autistic population.
Individuals with autism may wake up during the
night several times a week and stay awake for
extensive periods of time (Bauman, 2010).
Many things can impact a child’s ability to sleep.
One common thread is that children with ASD
often have greater anxiety and/or depression than
other children. These feelings can cause a child
to lay awake worrying, making it difficult for
them to turn off their brain and fall asleep. If the
child has a gastrointestinal disorder in addition to
ASD, this can also be a factor to their ability to
stay asleep throughout the night. Some sleeping
problems can be attributed to behavioural
problems in which the child hasn’t adjusted to
limits being set. Any medications that a child
may be taking can affect how they sleep.
Regardless of the reason or theory for sleep
disorders, it is critical that children on the autism
spectrum get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can cause
difficulties with attention, training, behaviours, or
functioning during normal daytime hours, and can
interfere with learning (Malow et al., 2012).
Although there are many reported sleep problems,
difficulties
with
obtaining
proper
polysomnographic studies in this population have
resulted in fewer studies using objective measures
to define the sleep disorder. Studies using these
methods frequently find sleep abnormalities,
confirming what is commonly reported by parents
(Coury et al., 2009).

There are extremely limited data on circadian
dysregulation in toddlers and preschoolers with
ASD, derived from a small number of
participants. Existing findings suggest that very
young ASD children suffer from significant
disturbances in sleep circadian rhythmicity,
however these accounts are entirely based on
parental reports and have not yet been
corroborated by more objective measures of the
sleep-wake cycle. ASD preschoolers appear
vulnerable to circadian dysregulation at the level
of hormone secretion, however it seems that
circadian misalignment becomes more evident
in older children. ASD research is growingly
focusing on early pathophysiological and
behavioural markers of the disorder from fetal
life to toddlerhood. In this context, there is strong
evidence that melatonin abnormalities during
pregnancy and early regulatory problems during
infancy may lead to increased ASD risk,
suggesting that circadian abnormalities may be
causally associated with ASD-specific
disturbances in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis
(Karaivazoglou, & Assimakopoulos, 2018).
Sleep disorders can affect the entire family but
can be especially disruptive to the child, causing
additional behavioural issues. Parents can
establish routines to promote optimal sleeping
conditions. Some common practices include:
keeping the bedroom dark and cool, keeping the
waking and sleeping schedule consistent – even
on weekends, not allowing children to have
caffeine or coca cola, to establish a bedtime
routine and stick to it and to make sure children
get exercise each day.
Melatonin, a pineal gland secretion that responds
to darkness and promotes sleep in humans, is
viewed by many as a natural and well tolerated
treatment for sleep latency problems, where
delayed or reduced melatonin release may be
present. Several studies have reported on the use
of melatonin in treating insomnia in children
with
developmental
problems,
with
improvement in the majority of patients
(Andersen et al. 2008, Johnson and Mallow,
2008). It has also shown to be effective in adults
with autism and chronic sleep problems, most
frequently sleep latency concerns (GalliCarminati, Deriaz, and Bertschy, 2009).
Melatonin is possibly safe when taken by mouth

as a single dose. It is possibly unsafe when taken
by mouth or injected into the body in multiple
doses in the short-term. Because of its effects on
other hormones, melatonin might interfere with
development during adolescence. Melatonin
might make bleeding worse in people with
bleeding disorders and might make symptoms of
depression worse. It also might increase blood
sugar in people with diabetes. Melatonin can
raise blood pressure in people who are taking
certain medications to control blood pressure.
Using melatonin might increase the risk of
having a seizure.
1.3. Gastrointestinal disorders
The most common gastrointestinal disorders
which are connected with ASD are chronic
diarrhoea and constipation. Other GI issues
include frequent abdominal pain, gaseousness
and painful stooling. Chronic GI issues with
increased severity of autism’s behavioural
symptoms – including repetitive behaviours,
social withdrawal, hyperactivity and irritability.
The association between GI issues and these
autism symptoms may be particularly strong
among nonverbal persons who have difficulty
communicating pain and distress (Autism
Speaks, 2017). Researchers have still not been
able to clearly define why these children are
more susceptible to GI problems but some
studies suggest dietary allergies may play a role
in some cases. Some children have been found
to fare better when removing dairy and gluten
from their diets. Others do better when processed
foods with dyes are eliminated and others have
added probiotics to their diet to offset symptoms.
Some food elimination diets, such as glutenfree/casein-free, have gained popularity in the
autistic population and have also shown some
improvement with GI symptoms. Current
literature does not support this as a first-line
intervention (Cash, 2011) but suggests these
diets may be more effective on a case-by-case
basis. Food elimination diets may alleviate GI
symptoms by removing an unknown allergen or
item that is not well-tolerated. Theories suggest
ingesting irritant foods causes inflammation in
the gut lining that causes the membranes to leak,
releasing particles into the body outside the GI
tract (Malow et al., 2012).

Children suffering from GI problems may not
exhibit typical symptoms so in some cases
parents may not even know there is a problem.
Some behaviours that can indicate a problem
may include: coughing excessively, refusing to
swallow food or difficulty swallowing, hitting
self in jaw or fisting the jaw, chewing
excessively, chewing on clothes, chin tapping,
sleep problems, eating to relieve symptoms and
unexplained changes in behaviour.
Treatment depends on identification of the
underlying GI issue. Some treatments
considered may be food elimination trials, as
well as allergy testing, to look for possible food
sensitivities. Other treatments follow the
standard care for issues such as GERD,
constipation or diarrhoea (Buie et al., 2010). If a
GI issue is suspected and standard treatments
have not shown improvement, referral to a
gastroenterologist who has experience with
children with autism is recommended.
One research into potential genetic causes for
autism spectrum disorders has indicated a role
for the autism spectrum disorder MET promoter
variant rs1858830 in individuals with cooccurring ASD and gastrointestinal conditions,
suggesting that there are new opportunities for
research on this relationship (Campbell, 2009).
1.4. Feeding disorders
Children with sensory issues due to autism may
be at risk for feeding disorders including
difficulty eating or swallowing food based on the
smell, texture or colour. These children tend to
be picky eaters and may even throw tantrums
when asked to eat certain foods. The term
“feeding disorder” describes problems with
eating enough or the right type of food. Among
children with autism, this often involves eating
only a few types of foods, eating only certain
textures or colours of food, and/or disruptive
mealtime behaviour. These issues have many
causes, including sensory aversions, anxiety (e.g.
after an incidence of choking, gagging or
vomiting) and rigidity (aversion to change).
Many children with autism also have motor
issues that involve difficulty with chewing and
swallowing. Others have digestion problems
such as slow stomach emptying (Autism Speaks,
2017). One review of diagnostic records found

117

Trajkovski V. Health condition in persons with autism spectrum disorders

that an estimated 70 percent of children on the
autism spectrum have feeding and/or eating
problems and 36 percent of these had problems
classified as “severe” (Romero et al., 2016).
Chronic overeating is a common issue among
both children and adults on the autism spectrum.
Some people with autism have poor sensitivity
to internal cues such as feeling full. Autismrelated aversions to strong flavours, textures and
smells can lead to overconsumption of highcalorie, low-nutrient foods. In addition, increased
appetite is a common and serious side effect of
the only FDA-approved medicines for autismassociated challenging behaviour (agitation) –
risperidone and aripiprazole (Scahill, 2016). The
result is a high incidence of obesity – often
combined with nutritional deficiencies – in both
children and adults on the autism spectrum
(Croen et al., 2015).
Pica, the dangerous habit of eating nonfood
items, is another feeding disorder long associated
with autism. Anecdotally, pica appears to be
concentrated among those whose autism is
complicated by intellectual disability. It can
include swallowing sharp objects such as nails,
broken glass and pins, as well as poisonous
substances such as paint chips and swimming
pool chlorine tablets. Pica can place tremendous
stress on caregivers by demanding their constant
vigilance (Call et al., 2015). Parents dealing with
these picky eaters are encouraged to offer
choices while still having their child stick to the
rules. Children should know that they have to eat
one vegetable at dinner, but allow them to
choose which one. It is also important to ensure
that achild isn’t avoiding a food because of an
allergy.
Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder
(ARFID) is a new diagnosis in the DSM-5, and
was previously referred to as “Selective Eating
Disorder.” ARFID is similar to anorexia in that
both disorders involve limitations in the amount
and/or types of food consumed, but unlike
anorexia, ARFID does not involve any distress
about body shape or size, or fears of fatness.
Although many children go through phases of
picky or selective eating, a person with ARFID
does not consume enough calories to grow and
develop properly and, in adults, to maintain basic
body function. In children, this results in stalled

weight gain and vertical growth; in adults, it
results in weight loss. ARFID can also result in
problems at school or work, due to difficulties
eating with others and extended times needed to
eat. People with autism spectrum conditions are
much more likely to develop ARFID, as are
those with ADHD and intellectual disabilities
(APA, 2013).
1.5. Immune disorders
A link between immune dysfunction and autism
is further exemplified by a recent multi-genome
analysis study, which found links between genes
that predispose individuals to aberrant immune
response to infections and risk of developing
autism (Saxena et al., 2012), as well as two
separate findings from large European birth
cohorts, which both found perturbed immune
responses and pro-inflammatory biomarkers in
mothers and newborns who later develop autism
(Abdallah et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2013). In
autism, findings of chronic inflammation and
immune dysregulation throughout the central
nervous system are accompanied by serum
findings, all pointing to widespread
dysregulation of immune mechanisms.
Individuals with autism often display immune
abnormalities in the form of altered cytokine
profiles, autoantibodies, changes in immune cell
function and abnormal mast cell activation
(Ashwood et al., 2011).
Multiple allergies are common in children with
autism, which supports the theory of an
underlying immune system dysfunction in this
population. The combination of food and
environmental allergies often results in a domino
effect on other body systems, evidenced by an
inflammatory response with elevated serum
cytokine and immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels.
This is believed to affect the neurological system
in individuals with autism. Reactions to common
food or environmental allergies may vary from
local to systemic and manifest in some children
as behavioural or sleep issues (Autism
Treatment Trust, 2013). Food allergies, like
autism, have an underlying link to the immune
system, which is why it’s possible that they may
go hand in hand. In most cases the food allergies
are not life-threatening for children with ASD

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Medical Aspects of Disability

however certain foods may cause worsening of
autistic symptoms.
In the Macedonian study we examined specific
IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies to food antigens in
35 participants with an autism spectrum disorder
and 21 of their siblings. A statistically significant
higher plasma concentration of IgA antibodies
against alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin,
casein, and gliadin were found in the children
with a ASD. Plasma concentrations of IgG
antibodies against alpha-lactalbumin, betalactoglobulin, and casein in participants with
ASD were significantly higher. IgE-specific
antibodies
(alpha-lactalbumin,
betalactoglobulin, casein, and gluten), as well as
plasma concentration of total IgE, also were
statistically significantly higher in the
participants with ASD (Trajkovski et al., 2008).
Both IgE and non-IgE mediated allergic
reactions are increasingly recognised causative
factors of anxiety and mood disorders. As well,
these allergic reactions contribute to difficulty
focusing, irritability, tics, daytime fatigue and
sleep problems in both children and adults. In
this survey it was found that approximately 16%
of people with autism suffer from some kind of
allergy to food, inhalants, etc. These findings
indicate intestinal immunological disturbances
and the need for gluten-casein free diets in this
population (Trajkovski, 2013). Current
treatment recommendations for allergies include
avoiding the allergen (if known), testing for
allergens, and evaluation by an allergy specialist.
Antihistamines may be given to treat symptoms.
The connection between autism and
autoimmune disorders is gaining increasing
support with a number of studies demonstrating
a high incidence of autoimmune conditions in
autism and an association between serum levels
of various autoantibodies and severity of autistic
symptoms (Chen et al., 2013). Autoantibodies to
folate receptors for example are suspected to
play a pathological role in some forms of
idiopathic autism because of their negative
effects on cerebral folate metabolism and wellknown
involvement
in
other
neurodevelopmental syndromes (Ramaekers et
al., 2012). Family history of autoimmune
diseases is significantly higher in autistic
children than in the general population

(McDougle and Carlezon, 2013). The
combination of these findings has led many
researchers and clinicians to suggest that
autoimmune mechanisms could be a causative
or contributing factor in at least a subset of
individuals with autism.
1.6. Autism and infections
Vulnerability to infections is high in children and
pregnant women. If infection occurs during
pregnancy, the outcome depends on the immune
status of the mother, the type and strain of the
virus and the development stage of the fetus.
Other factors, such as generic predisposition to
autism may be important. Viral infections lead to
the production of cytokines which can destroy
neurons and damage fetal development.
Depending on the virus and the site where the
infection occurs, the cytokines could be
produced directly in the brain or gain access to it
through the blood-brain barrier. The most
described viruses associated with the etiology of
ASD are: herpes virus, cytomegalovirus,
measles virus and rubella virus (Ghaziuddin,
2018). In the Macedonian sample, the most
prevalent medical condition was the acute
infectious disease varicella in (34.5%) and
measles in (6.5%) of the people with autism
(Trajkovski, 2013).
1.7. Headaches
One of the less common ASD symptoms is
headaches. One reason may be because ASD
can be associated with pain insensitivity. This
means that the child may just not feel the pain of
a typical headache the same way a child without
ASD would. Research has however indicated a
link between migraines and ASD. One
study found that children with sensory
hyperactivity were more likely to experience
migraines. Additionally those children with
higher levels of anxiety are more likely to have
migraines or cluster headaches than others
(Sullivan et al., 2013).
Children with ASD may also suffer from
headaches if they are head bangers. Children
who bang their heads may be doing so in an
attempt to limit the pain signals that are being
delivered to their brains. Inflammation caused by
GI disorders can also cause headaches in a child.

Trajkovski V. Health condition in persons with autism spectrum disorders

Nutritional changes, behavioural therapies and
other treatments to reduce anxiety can play a
significant role in reducing these symptoms.
1.8. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial
dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities
There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial
dysfunction, perturbation in sulfur and amino
acid metabolism, and high levels of oxidative
stress are common in people affected by autism.
Elevations in metabolic markers of oxidative
stress as well as reduced levels of glutathione and
other cellular antioxidants have been found in
many areas of the body, including the brain and
primary immune cells (Rose et al., 2012).
Reactive oxygen species are destructive to cells
and organs and elevated oxidative stress has been
implicated in autoimmune, inflammatory,
cardiovascular and neurodegene-rative diseases
and cancer. A substantial percentage of autistic
patients display markers of abnormal
mitochondrial energy metabolism, such as
elevated lactate, pyruvate, and alanine in blood,
urine and/or cerebrospinal fluid, as well as serum
carnitine deficiency (Frye et al., 2013). In the
majority of cases this abnormal energy
metabolism cannot be linked to specific inborn
mitochondrial disease, or another primary inborn
error of metabolism. It has therefore been
suggested that in autism, abnormalities in
mitochondrial function could be a downstream
consequence of immune dysfunction (Rossignol
and Frye, 2011). Insufficient mitochondrial
energy production could both result from and
contribute to cellular oxidative stress and chronic
inflammation in autism. Raising antioxidant
levels and/or metabolic precursors and
supporting mitochondrial function have been
proposed as treatment avenues. Routine
metabolic screening and mitochondrial
functional studies required for the diagnosis of
mitochondrial disease are rarely performed for
patients with autism, and the hypothesis of an
etiological link between autism and
mitochondrial dysfunction has therefore not
been properly assessed. Mitochondrial
dysfunction contributes to a number of language
deficits, abnormal energy metabolism, chronic
gastrointestinal problems, abnormalities in fatty
acid oxidation, and increased oxidative stress.

Nutritional supplementation to decrease
oxidative stress along with factors to improve
reduced glutathione, as well as hyperbaric
oxygen therapy represent supported and
rationale approaches. There is a need for reliable
laboratory markers to detect abnormalities of
mitochondrial function, which will then facilitate
further clinical investigations in this subgroup of
children with autism.

2. Mental health comorbidities
Epidemiological studies suggest that between 54
and 70% of people with autism also have one or
more other mental health conditions (Romero,
2016). Like autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder are neurodevelopmental
conditions that appear to have roots in early brain
development. Among people with autism,
anxiety and depression may stem, at least in part,
from autism-related impairments that increase
daily stress and social isolation and decrease
overall quality of life (Vasa et al., 2016).
Untreated mental health conditions can
profoundly worsen autism’s behavioural
challenges. But because of overlapping
symptoms, they can be particularly difficult to
identify in someone who has autism (Sikora et al.,
2012). The social withdrawal associated with
depression or schizophrenia, for example, can be
difficult to distinguish from autism-related social
impairments. In addition, many people with
autism have difficulty identifying and expressing
emotions and other internal feelings. Autism
specialists have developed guidelines for
diagnosing and treating some of the most
common mental health conditions affecting
children, and adults who have autism.
2.1. Autism and ADHD
Over the last decade, studies have suggested that
between 30 and 61 percent of people with autism
also have symptoms of ADHD (Romero, 2016).
Symptoms of ADHD include a persistent pattern
of inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity
that interferes with daily life, social development
and learning. People with ADHD often fail to
pay close attention to details and make careless
mistakes at school or work. Often, they don’t
appear to listen when spoken to, have trouble
organizing tasks and fail to follow through on

instructions and assignments, especially those
that require sustained attention.
2.2. Autism and anxiety disorders
Studies suggest that between 11 and 42% of
people with autism struggle with one or more
anxiety disorder (Vasa et al., 2016). These
disorders include separation anxiety, panic
disorder and phobias (extreme fear of certain
noises, places). Most research on anxiety in
autism has focused on children and adults who
are verbal and have normal to high intelligence.
Experts agree on the need for more studies
involving the one-third of people with autism
who are nonverbal or minimally verbal and/or
have intellectual disability. Anxiety can trigger
strong internal sensations of tension that include
a racing heart, muscle tightness and stomach
ache. In someone with autism, these feelings can
prompt an increase in self-soothing, repetitive
behaviours (flapping, rocking, spinning, etc.)
and/or destructive or self-harming behaviours
(shredding, clothing, head banging, etc.).
Similarly, anxiety can be the underlying cause of
new resistance to what had been an enjoyed
activity (e.g. a trip to the beach, a birthday party,
school, etc.) (Autism Speaks, 2017).
2.3. Autism and depression
Depression affects an estimated 7% children and
26% of adults with autism (Croen, 2015). This
compares to 2% of children and close to 7
percent of adults in the general U.S. population.
A recent report in the journal Pediatrics found
that the rate of depression among children with
autism rose dramatically with age, from just
under 5 percent in grade-schoolers to just over
20% in teenagers. It likewise rose with
intellectual ability (IQ), as well as the presence of
one or more of the medical conditions that
commonly accompany autism – particularly
seizures and gastrointestinal issues. That
depression rates rise with age and intellectual
ability suggests a painful awareness of autism’s
social challenges and isolation, the researchers
propose. That the rates increase with associated
medical conditions may demonstrate their
profound effect on quality of life. The authors
called on healthcare professionals to consider
screening for depression as a routine part of care

for teens and adults who have autism –
particularly those with normal to high IQ and
those with additional medical issues. Signs and
symptoms of depression include chronic feelings
of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness,
emptiness and/or irritability. Also common:
social isolation, moving or talking slowly,
feeling restless, and having trouble sitting still or
concentrating. At its most serious, depression
can include frequent thoughts about death and/or
suicide (Autism Speaks, 2017).
2.4. Autism and schizophrenia
In terms of symptoms, autism and schizophrenia
both involve impairments in processing
language and understanding other people’s
thoughts and feelings. Clear differences include
schizophrenia’s hallmark psychosis, which often
involves hallucinations. In addition, autism’s
core symptoms typically emerge between ages 1
and 3 years; schizophrenia’s in early adulthood.
Many clinicians have reported identifying
autism at high rates in adults already diagnosed
with schizophrenia and vice versa. Investigations
looking at how commonly these two conditions
occur together vary widely in their findings.
Taken together, the studies found schizophrenia
in 4 to 35% of adults who have autism and found
autism in 4 to 60% of those who have
schizophrenia. Many of the same gene
changes known to increase risk of autism also
increase the risk of schizophrenia (Autism
Speaks, 2017).
2.5. Autism and bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder also known
as “manic depression”. People with bipolar
disorder tend to alternate between a frenzied state
known as mania and episodes of depression.
While some people experience only the manic
episodes, most alternate between these two states
and can show extreme irritability. Research
shows that children and adults with autism are at
increased risk for bipolar disorder. However,
studies vary widely in estimating the prevalence
of bipolar disorder among people with autism,
ranging from 6 to 27%. Bipolar disorder affects
around 4% of the general population. Some
leading experts propose that bipolar disorder
may be over-diagnosed in those who have

autism, due to overlapping symptoms such as
hyperactivity, irritability and disturbed sleep.
They caution mental health providers to tease
apart the symptoms of true bipolar disorder from
those of autism by looking at when the
symptoms appeared and how long they lasted.
The antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole
can treat irritability in children with autism,
though both tend to produce significant weight
gain and diabetes risk (Autism Speaks, 2017).

Conclusions
Autism can affect the whole body. An increasing
number of medical disorders are being identified
in individuals with ASD and studies are starting
to identify the conditions that probably play a
causal role in etio-pathogenesis. People
identified with autism spectrum disorders have
high frequencies of one or more co-occurring
non-ASD
developmental,
psychiatric,
neurologic, metabolic, immune, gastrointestinal
and possibly causative medical diagnoses.
Seizures, disturbed sleep and painful
gastrointestinal disorders are some of the health
conditions commonly associated with autism.
Autism is also frequently accompanied by
mental health conditions including anxiety,
depression, and ADHD. Medical conditions and
consecutive pathological processes can
negatively impact behaviour, socialisation,
communication, cognitive function and sensory
processing of individuals with autism. It is also
becoming increasingly clear that the medical
comorbidities that underlie autism are not
stagnant or transient, but tend to be chronic and
in many cases, if left unrecognised and untreated,
progressive. Accurate diagnosis and treatment
often results in improved level of functioning
and decreased severity of symptoms. Healthcare
providers should be aware of the medical
conditions that occur with ASD. Children with
autism do not have typical presentations for
medical illnesses and that’s why careful
assessment and attention should be paid to the
subtlest differences that occur.
Autism-associated health problems extend
across the life span – from young children to
senior citizens. A better understanding of the
possible mechanisms leading to poorer health
status will enable improved patient care and

ultimately enhance the quality of life for people
with autism spectrum disorders. Despite the
prevalence of these health conditions, more
systematic research is needed to understand their
manifestation in people with ASD and the best
practices for identifying and treating them.
Specialists at autism care centres are working
with patients and their families to improve the
health and quality of life of all those with ASD
by developing and disseminating evaluation and
treatment guidelines for healthcare providers.
Appropriate and individualised medical
assessments must be carried out in all cases,
including a documented clinical examination.
Autism spectrum disorder usually occurs with
medical or psychiatric health conditions.
Treatment should address not only the
symptoms of autism but also those of the
associated comorbidities.
