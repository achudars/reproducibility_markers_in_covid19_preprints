DEFINITION

10

Although there are several definitions for civil service models, one simple operational definition

11

describes them as systems of public employment management and human resources management

12

(Echeberría 2006). There are also more complex conceptualisations which define them as a set of

13

legal rules and instruments which enable the State to assure a staff of civil servants who are apt for

14

the efficient functioning of its distinct levels of administration (Oszlak 2001). The Ibero-American

15

Charter for the Public Service, signed by the Latin American governments in 2003, indicates that the

16

civil service models must aim towards a professional administration and merit-based recruitment

17

processes. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

18

highlights that the recruitment of civil servants must guarantee equal opportunities (OECD 2008).

19

Despite the wide use of this concept, its dissemination and acceptance have been lesser in Latin

20

America and it is frequently replaced by the public function concept.

INTRODUCTION

22

One of the main characteristics of Weber’s bureaucratic model was selection by neutral com-

23

petence, that is, the civil servants be selected according to norms of performance and merit, and
1

González-Bustamante (2018)

24

not for personal characteristics or beliefs (Peters 1995). The fundamental value in the search for

25

neutral competence was the capacity to professionalise government management and public admi-

26

nistration (Kaufman 1956). This professionalisation is relevant since it determines the capacity of

27

public organisms, which affects the processes of formulation and implementation of public policies

28

(Farazmand 1997).

29

Nevertheless, merit in the public sector is something complex to define, since personal charac-

30

teristics or beliefs can positively influence government efficiency (Peters 1995). In fact, political

31

appointees and spoil systems have advantages like the development of a committed bureaucracy.

32

The controversy between merit-based recruitment and the political appointee is associated with the

33

politics-administration dichotomy. This concept refers to the traditional idea that proposes sepa-

34

rating the political sphere from the administrative within government (Wilson 1887). According

35

to Peters (1995), this controversy is a question of degree, since all political systems make political

36

appointments at a certain level and additionally have posts which are filled in a routine manner

37

according to some type of merit system.

38

Even though currently, the politics-administration dichotomy tends to be considered a simplistic

39

vision of public administration and bureaucracy (Frederickson et al. 2012), the tension between

40

merit and partisanship in the appointment of civil servants remains as an academic debate and the

41

discussion continues in different spheres (Olavarría-Gambi and Dockendorff 2016). The defenders

42

of professionalisation conceive of the systems of selection and recruitment based on merit as a public

43

good which permits the prevention of the political use of the administration. On the other hand, the

44

counter-argument affirms that professionalisation can produce an autonomy that is damaging for

45

democratic representativeness (Farazmand 1989; 1997; Olavarría-Gambi and Dockendorff 2016;

46

Rockman 1996).

47

This chapter examines the concept of public service models with special emphasis on the Latin

48

American reality. The following section deals with the subject from an historical perspective, its

49

ties to the patronage systems, and the main milestones which have shaped the evolution of the civil

50

services. Subsequently, the next section deals with the chief characteristics and changes in the civil

2

González-Bustamante (2018)

51

services and presents an evaluation of the models in Latin America. Finally, the last section sets

52

out some brief conclusions and summarises the main ideas of this entry.

53

THE CIVIL SERVICE MODELS FROM AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

54

According to Raadschelders and Rutgers (1996), it is possible to identify different stages in the

55

historical development of the civil service models. First, during feudalism and the late Middle Ages,

56

it is possible to identify civil servants subordinate to a specific ruler. Later, during the seventeenth

57

and eighteenth centuries, civil servants are employed by the State, a situation which permitted the

58

differentiation of the public sphere from the private. After that, during the nineteenth century,

59

civil servants were considered as agents that were not only in the service of the State, but at this

60

point, the administration tended to be independent of political power and the politics-administration

61

dichotomy emerges. Lastly, in the twentieth century, professional civil service models consolidate

62

with the aim of providing adequate public goods and services.

63

From another perspective, following Grindle (2012), the emergence of the civil service models

64

can be associated with patronage systems and clientelism which date back to the eighteenth century.

65

These systems emerged from an institutional architecture where academic credentials were of great

66

relevance for obtaining positions of privilege in the State. This benefited the political and social

67

elites of the period. In Great Britain and France, for example, clientelism worked as a mechanism

68

to guarantee the access of the elite to public employment and to ensure their well-being. In Japan

69

and Prussia, on the other hand, clientelism and civil service models were an instrument for the

70

construction and consolidation of authoritarian States.

71

In Latin America, patronage systems and clientelism dating back to the nineteenth and twentieth

72

centuries are also to be found (Grindle 2012). During the nineteenth century, the independence

73

movements eradicated a sizeable part of the Spanish and Portuguese colonial heritage. However,

74

the patronage systems and clientelism remained intact as elements peculiar to Latin American

75

politics. Due to the aforementioned, public employment did not adjust to meritocratic logic; rather,

76

it was reserved for certain social groups and it was used as an element to negotiate political loyalties

77

(Grindle 2012; Nef 2003). The consolidation of the Latin American civil service models has
3

González-Bustamante (2018)

78

historically been tied to critical junctures, i.e. corruption scandals, political or economic crises,

79

among others. Notwithstanding this, the different reforms promoted have not managed to eliminate

80

the latent patronage systems and clientelism (Grindle 2012).

81

During the twentieth century, the civil service models gradually consolidated, especially in the

82

United States, Europe, and Japan. This involved putting to one side the spoil systems and patronage.

83

Also public services began to align their services with the user-satisfaction. This tendency became

84

consolidated with the emergence of New Public Management (Grindle 2012). This concept is

85

associated with a set of administrative doctrines and neo-managerial reforms which dominated the

86

agenda of several OECD countries from the late 1970s. The central premise to these doctrines can

87

be summed up as directing State organisations as if they were private enterprises and that public

88

directors must have high levels of discretion in order to make efficient use of available resources

89

(Christensen and Lægreid 2011; Hood 1991; Llano 2015).

90

This was complemented by the World Bank’s first-generation reforms, which promoted the

91

deregulation of markets, privatisation of public companies, outsourcing of services, reduction of

92

public spending, as well as an important reduction in the size of civil services (Oszlak 2001). These

93

neoconservative reforms are associated with the rise in neoliberal politics in Latin America from the

94

time of the Washington Consensus. The package of neoconservative and neomanagerial reforms

95

was considered a fundamental piece for the progress of democracies in development (Llano 2015;

96

Pollitt and Bouckaert 2002). This produced what Olsen (2006) called modernisation by imitation.

97

Subsequently, the second-generation reforms were implemented with the extended Washington

98

Consensus. These reforms were less neoconservative, e.g. prudent openness to capital, the fight

99

against corruption, focused poverty-reduction policies, and the creation of social security networks.

100

This boosted a revindication by the public sector through an institutional strengthening to generate

101

regulation capacities and the creation of anti-corruption organisms (Santiso 2001).

102

In this context, the need to reduce political appointments became relevant. Moreover, the

103

existence of a group of senior civil servants separated from the political sphere and from the classical

104

bureaucracy became a fundamental value for the reforms of the Latin American civil service models

4

González-Bustamante (2018)

105

(Ramos and Scrollini 2013). This, added to the growing need to rely on professional models of

106

public services, was reflected in the Santa Cruz Consensus of June 2003 within the framework

107

of the Fifth Ibero-American Conference of Ministers of Public Administration and State Reform.

108

In this instance, the Latin American governments signed the Ibero-American Charter for Public

109

Service, which defines the fundamentals for a professional public service and assigns orienting

110

principles for its creation.

111

CHARACTERISTICS AND CHANGES OF CIVIL SERVICE MODELS

112

The Ibero-American Charter for the Public Service indicates that there is a positive correlation

113

between the professionalisation of a civil service and the levels of confidence of citizens in the

114

public administration, government efficiency, levels of transparency, and the capacity to generate

115

economic growth. A professionalised civil service model has a positive impact on economic and

116

democratic development and on overcoming poverty (Evans and Rauch 1999; Henderson et al.

117

2007; Lafuente et al. 2013). The civil service is relevant for State capacity since it generates

118

incentives and restrictions for the action of public organisms in a transversal way (Barzelay 2001).

119

Moreover, it represents an important State investment, since on average salary costs in central

120

administration of the Latin American countries represents 5.6% of the GDP and 27% of total

121

public spending (Cortázar et al. 2014a).

122

A civil service model can be classified according to its degrees of openness and the tension

123

between its level of politicisation and professionalisation (Ballart and Ramió 2000; González-

124

Bustamante et al. 2016; Ramió and Salvador 2005). The degrees of openness determine whether

125

the model is open or closed. An open model is founded on the selection of civil servants based on

126

their technical specialisation. In contrast, a closed model favours life-long tenure, which implies

127

that civil servants must be versatile and adapt to the different needs of the organisation throughout

128

their career. It is possible to find mixed models which mix specialisation and versatility.

129

The relation between politicisation and professionalisation, on the other hand, takes account

130

of the tension between the prioritisation of professional merits and political confidence. All the

131

civil service models possess political appointees and career officials, appointed in a routine manner
5

González-Bustamante (2018)

132

according to some system of merit. What do vary are the limits; that is, until what hierarchical

133

level are appointments based on merit, and where do political appointments begin? (Peters 1995).

134

Usually, political appointees are designated for shorter periods than career officials (Lewis 2008;

135

Resh 2015). The traditional civil service models have a limited capacity to produce senior civil

136

servants, which is why professionalisation fostered a differentiation between the managerial function

137

and the ordinary civil service. This is how senior civil services emerged. In some countries, the

138

managerial function is differentiated, e.g. Belgium, Canada, Chile, the United States, Holland,

139

Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Sweden. In other cases, the civil servant career and the

140

managerial level are not separated, e.g. Germany, Austria, Colombia, Spain, France, Japan, Mexico

141

(Longo 2003; Martínez Puón 2012).

142

In the models with high levels of politicisation, there is a sensation of violation of the acceptable

143

limits of the balance between political nominations and merit-based appointments (Peters and

144

Pierre 2004). They can even become similar to the American spoil system of the nineteenth

145

century (Ramió and Salvador 2005). Nevertheless, although politicisation does have a generally

146

negative connotation, it also has potentially positive aspects since it can generate a more committed

147

bureaucracy which invigorates the public service, something which is not possible with a neutral

148

bureaucracy (Peters and Pierre 2004). The politicised models can be open-circuit or closed

149

(Quermonne 1995). The open-circuit model implies a selection of civil servants based on political

150

confidence subsidised by professional criteria. The closed-circuit, in contrast, implies direct

151

nominations that give preference to political confidence with the presence of some professional

152

merits.

153

The reforms of the Latin American civil service models have been conditioned by the process

154

of modernisation of public management and the fight against corruption (Barzelay 2003; Lafuente

155

et al. 2013). There are several cases in which there is no specific model, whereas in others there are

156

highly professionalised services, particularly in the diplomatic area (Ramió and Salvador 2005).

157

On the other hand, countries such as Bolivia and Mexico have tried to implement civil services in

158

some areas since the 1990s. There are also cases such as Chile, which historically had a model of

6

González-Bustamante (2018)

159

civil service which was dismantled by the military dictatorship and in the past decade has fostered

160

changes and revisions of its institutionalism (González-Bustamante et al. 2016).

161

Over the past decades, there has been a noticeable tension stemming from the institutional

162

strength or weakness of the different civil service models in Latin America. On the one hand, there

163

are countries whose institutional frameworks permit the prediction of a positive evolution of their

164

civil service models. However, other cases present problems with respect to the political capacity

165

to reach agreements and drive reforms (Echeberría 2006). In this context, diverse civil service

166

models have been created or have been completely reformed since 1990, e.g. Argentina, Bolivia,

167

Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and

168

Venezuela. Others have undergone significant reforms over the past decade, e.g. Brazil, Chile, and

169

Uruguay.

170

EVALUATION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE MODELS IN LATIN AMERICA

171

Although the degrees of openness and the tension between politicisation and professionalisation

172

are relevant, they are not the only elements for classifying a civil service model. According to

173

Longo (2001), it is possible to distinguish at least four key elements: (i) systems of access to

174

employment; (ii) organisation of the career; (iii) the recognition of rights of civil servants; and (iv)

175

administration of the system. For example, with respect to the systems of access particularly, at

176

least three classical models can be distinguished: (i) the French model, which emphasises tenders

177

and civil servant schools; (ii) the German model, focused on the process of extended learning in

178

different stages among which there is a preparatory stage and different exams which enable the

179

exercise of public functions; and (iii) the British model, with an emphasis on the professionalisation

180

and independence of the organisms in charge of the system.

181

An effective way of evaluating the changes in the Latin American civil service models is to use

182

the methodology of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is based on the Ibero-

183

American Charter for Public Service to measure critical points and evaluate civil services. The

184

baseline measure was carried out in 2004 and 93 critical points, associated with different indicators,

185

were identified. In 2010 critical points were reduced to 33 to ensure comparability and a second
7

González-Bustamante (2018)

186

measurement was taken between 2012 and 2015. The methodology evaluates the civil service

187

models in eight subsystems: (i) human resources planning; (ii) work organisation; (iii) employment

188

management; (iv) performance management; (v) compensation management; (vi) development

189

management; (vii) human and social relations management; and (viii) human resources function

190

organisation. This permits the calculation of five aggregate indexes: efficiency, merit, structural

191

consistency, functional capacity, and integrating capacity. The details of this methodology can be

192

reviewed in Longo and Iacoviello (2010), Iacoviello and Strazza (2014), and OECD (2016).

193

The merit index serves precisely to evaluate the degree of politicisation of the civil service

194

models, since their critical points are: (i) recruitment for the filling of posts open to all candidates

195

that fulfil the required criteria based on technical requirements; (ii) the existence of mechanism

196

and procedures to prevent arbitrariness in the selection; and (iii) dismissal of technical personal

197

not motivated by political changes. The regional average in 2004 was 33 points on a scale of

198

100, which rose to 45 in the 2012-2015 measurement. The countries with a weak merit-based

199

recruitment process are Bolivia, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama. The most dramatic fall in the

200

last decade was in Bolivia. In contrast, countries with a high index are Brazil, Uruguay, and Costa

201

Rica (Fig. 1).

202

The five indexes showed an increase from 2004. However, the most important advance is

203

reflected precisely in the merit index, followed by structural consistency (Longo and Echebarría

204

2014). Furthermore, with the evaluation of the civil service models of 16 Latin American countries

205

by IDB, it is also possible to calculate the Civil Service Development Index (CSDI) as an aggregate

206

index for most countries in the region. The regional average of CSDI for 2012-2015 reaches 40

207

points on a scale of 100, which implies a rise of 10 points in the past decade. Bolivia, Honduras,

208

and Guatemala are the countries with the lowest indexes. The deterioration of the Bolivian civil

209

service model is relevant and occurred specifically because, as from 2006, the government decided

210

to prioritise direct appointments without tenders in order to favour historically marginalised sectors

211

(Iacoviello and Strazza 2014). Nevertheless, there are cases that have improved substantially over the

212

last decade, with Peru, Ecuador, and El Salvador standing out here, registering an increase of more

8

González-Bustamante (2018)

213

than 20 points. El Salvador, for example, managed this important increase thanks to the creation

214

of a unit of coordination and gradual implementation of tenders, whereas in Ecuador the drive

215

was associated chiefly with the creation of the Public Service Vice-Ministry (Viceministerio del

216

Servicio Público) (Iacoviello and Strazza 2014). The countries with the highest indexes are Chile,

217

Brazil, and Costa Rica (Fig. 2). Brazil and Chile particularly are the most consolidated countries

218

in the region. Whereas Chile shows greater development due to expansion and consolidation of

219

its System of High-Level Public Management (Sistema de Alta Dirección Pública) (González-

220

Bustamante et al. 2016), Brazil displays less dynamism despite the fact that in the past decade it

221

consolidated a general performance evaluation system (Iacoviello and Strazza 2014).

222

In summary, the professionalisation of the Latin American civil service models presents range

223

of nuances. One important group of countries, as Iacoviello and Strazza (2014) point out, has

224

achieved several improvements after setting out from a low baseline in 2004. Another group

225

of countries, which set out from a medium to medium-high baseline, shows relative stagnation.

226

Finally, only Chile shows significant advances in different dimensions, having departed from a

227

high baseline. Furthermore, certain gaps can be perceived between merit and the CSDI. The most

228

relevant negative gap is presented by Bolivia, which has a very low level of merit in comparison

229

with the development of its civil service model, which suggests that there are other indexes that

230

elevate its development, e.g. efficiency, structural consistency, functional capacity, and integrating

231

capacity. Then there is the Brazilian case, which works in the opposite way. The merit in its model

232

is very elevated for its level of development, which is, at any rate, one of the most consolidated in

233

the region. There are cases where a balance is observed, such as Chile, Mexico, and El Salvador.

234

In general, the advances and setbacks in the development of the civil service models in Latin

235

America are tied to the dynamics in the processes of reform and the national agendas for mo-

236

dernisation. According to Cortázar et al. (2014b), in the last decade, it is possible to identify

237

three types of reforms associated with the civil service which have different kinds of results in the

238

region: (i) the professionalisation of management level, e.g. Chile, Peru, and Uruguay; (ii) the

239

development of guarantees against politicisation, e.g. Paraguay and the Dominican Republic; and

9

González-Bustamante (2018)

240

(iii) compensation management, e.g. Costa Rica, Honduras, and Paraguay.

241

CONCLUSION

242

The civil service models are systems of management of public employment and recruitment

243

of civil servants. In recruitment, there is a tension between merit and political confidence. The

244

opposition between merit-based recruitment and the political appointees is associated with the

245

classical politics-administration dichotomy. This concept implies separating the political and the

246

administrative spheres in government. Defenders of merit and professionalisation point out that

247

these prevent the political use of the public administration. However, extreme professionalisation

248

can generate a bureaucratic autonomy which puts democratic representativeness at risk. A civil

249

service model can be classified according to different elements, one of the most relevant of these

250

being its degrees of openness and tension between politicisation and professionalisation.

251

In Latin America, the patronage systems and clientelism of the nineteenth and twentieth cen-

252

turies limited the evolution of civil service models. Subsequently, in the second half of the twentieth

253

century, the New Public Management and the neoconservative reforms conditioned the moderni-

254

sation of the public sector and of the civil service models. At the end of the twentieth century, the

255

second-generation reforms of the World Bank boosted a reinvention of the public sector in order

256

to generate capacities for regulation and the fight against corruption. In this context, the idea of

257

having a body of senior civil servants separated from the political and bureaucratic spheres became

258

relevant. Also, the need to rely on professional civil services grew.

259

That growing need in Latin America was crystallised with the Ibero-American Charter for Public

260

Service in 2003. Following the fundamentals of this charter, the IDB designed a methodology

261

which allowed to evaluate the models via different subsystems and to obtain an aggregate index

262

of development with which changes over time can be analysed. Thanks to this, we can observe

263

that the professionalisation of the Latin American civil services has different nuances. There

264

is a first group of countries which in the past decade had civil service models with a low level

265

of development and achieved partial improvements. In this group, some isolated cases attained

266

significant improvements. Then, there is a second group of countries whose models had a medium10

González-Bustamante (2018)

267

high development and presented a relative stagnation in recent years. Finally, only Chile and Brazil

268

have a highly developed model, and in the past ten years only Chile has shown significant advances.
