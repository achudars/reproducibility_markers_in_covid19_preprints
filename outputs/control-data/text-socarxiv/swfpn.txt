Title: Using Risk Terrain Modeling to Predict Homeless Related Crime in Los Angeles,
California
Abstract: We apply Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) to identify the factors that predict homeless
related crime at micro grid cells in Los Angeles, CA. We find that place based factors predicting
whether homeless individuals are victimized or the offender being homeless are largely
consistent with one another. Out of 26 different crime attractors and generators, prior drug
arrests, homeless shelters, and bus stops are the three biggest factors in predicting homeless
related crime. We show how the RTM model can effectively forecast future homeless related
crimes as well. This suggests that targeted spatial strategies can reduce both homeless offending
and victimization risk. Given that the majority of homeless individuals are only intermittently
homeless, place based strategies may be a more an effective way to limit risk than strategies that
focus on individuals.

Introduction
This article presents an application of Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) (Caplan, Kennedy,
& Miller, 2011) applied to predicting spatial areas of high risk of homeless related crime in Los
Angeles, California. Homeless populations present significant challenges for law enforcement.
The total number of homeless individuals has been rising in the United States in recent years,
with an estimated total of over half a million homeless in the US in 2017 (US News, 2017).
Tackling problems related to homelessness is intrinsically related to policing (Bittner, 1967;
Huey, 2007; White, 2010). Homeless individuals are at higher risk of both being victimized by
crime (Diette & Ribar, 2018; Ellsworth, 2018) as well as at higher risk of committing crime

2
(Crawford, Whitbeck, & Hoyt, 2011; Listwan, Hartman, & LaCourse, 2018). Even absent
involvement in serious crimes, loitering and camping in public places are frequently a citable
offense (Berk & MacDonald, 2010; Robinson, 2017; Stuart, 2016), and as such police are often
tasked with dealing with homeless individuals and the subsequent disorder they are associated
with (Vitale, 2010).
Homelessness is intrinsically related to the built environment – different outdoor
structures provide temporary shelter for transient individuals (such as bridges), and these factors
are fixed in space. These aspects of the built environment place unique constraints on the routine
activities of homeless individuals, and as such they are particularly suited to predict the locations
of homeless related crime. Given those spatial factors apply equally to all homeless individuals,
we additionally predict those factors will work equally well to predict either homeless offending
or homeless victimization. As such, this work will add to the voluminous literature that has
identified various individual level risk factors for homeless individuals (Ellsworth, 2018), and
provide spatial risk factors that can predict homeless crime risk. This is an advancement over the
limited prior work on the spatial patterns of homeless related crime, as it has focused on general
crime increases around homeless shelters or other homeless encampments, and did not examine
offending or victimization specifically by homeless individuals (Berk & MacDonald, 2010;
Faraji, Ridgeway, & Wu, 2018).
We believe applying RTM to homeless related crime can also help inform future criminal
justice strategies in Los Angeles in several ways. One is that by identifying the potential spatial
factors that contribute to higher homeless crime risk, RTM can guide problem oriented policing
or crime prevention through environmental design strategies to mitigate that risk. This is opposed
to current order-maintenance approaches, such as the use of arrest and citations, that have

3
negative externalities on the homeless and can be costly (Stuart, 2016; Wilking et al., 2018).
Identifying types of places that are associated with high risk can identify potential solutions to
homeless crime problems that do not strictly rely on traditional arrest based strategies (Chamard,
2010; Eck, 2018).
Second, prior police crackdowns on homeless related disorder focusing on Skid Row in
Los Angeles only resulted in minor crime reductions, and likely caused subsequent displacement
of homeless individuals (Vitale, 2010). We will show that while homeless related crime is
concentrated in Los Angeles' Skid Row, it extends out in various places around Los Angeles.
RTM by design can identify areas where crime displacement is likely to occur, and thus suggest
proactive strategies to simultaneously address high risk places that goes beyond typical hots
spots policing strategies.
Literature Review
Homelessness and Crime
The majority of prior work examining homeless related crime has been focused at the
individual level, either through self-reported surveys or ethnographies; see Ellsworth (2018) for a
review. Previous literature has identified that homeless individuals are both at high risk of
victimization as well as offending. For example, Lee & Schreck (2005) find that different risky
lifestyle behaviors (such as sleeping outdoors or panhandling), increase ones risk of violent and
property victimization, along with other more distal and demographic factors in a cross-sectional
survey. Diette & Ribar (2018) examine victimization in a longitudinal panel design, and find that
housing insecurity increases future risk of violence, independent of prior risks of violence. The
findings appear similar for offending as well, with Crawford, Whitbeck, & Hoyt (2009) finding
that self-reported measures of violent offending among a sample of juveniles were more likely

4
among homeless youth that participated in selling drugs or were in a gang, as was a history of
caretaker abuse. While the majority of this work focuses on self-reported measures of offending
and victimization, the few studies that do examine official arrest measures also illustrate that
homeless have a high risk of offending (Jeanis, Fox, & Muniz, 2018; Listwan et al., 2018).
Two prior analyses have conducted spatial analysis related to homeless crime (Berk &
MacDonald, 2010; Faraji et al., 2018). Berk & MacDonald (2010) analyzed the effect of the Safe
Cities initiative by the Los Angeles Police Department, which was an order-maintenance
policing strategy targeted at crime and disorder associated with homeless encampments in Skid
Row. While they found some crime reductions, the program was criticized for its use of citations
and arrests (Vitale, 2010).
Faraji et al. (2018) examine the impact that openings of emergency homeless shelters
have on nearby crime counts. They find that when shelters are opened they increase the number
of crimes nearby, and that when they close crime subsequently decreases. Neither of these
articles specifically analyzed homeless related crime (in terms of being committed by or against
a homeless individual); in each they simply measured trends and changes in overall crime
counts. Thus in neither case can it be directly inferred the interventions specifically reduced
offending by the homeless or victimization of the homeless (although reductions in at least one
of those two categories is the most likely explanation of the results).
Despite the dearth of previous research, it may however, make sense to examine
homeless related crime from a spatial lens. Homelessness is not a monolithic category. Most
individuals are not chronically homeless, but experience more brief, intermediate spells (Diette
& Ribar, 2018). The needs of the intermittently homeless may be easier to address than the
chronic homeless (Listwan et al., 2018), but the ability of the state to intervene on their behalf is

5
much more limited. Being intermittently homeless by its nature makes it is much harder to
identify when those particular individuals are currently homeless and offer services to mitigate
any individual’s risk.
Such intermittently homeless individuals are still at high risk of being victimized. Lee &
Schreck (2005) find that individuals who are more consistently homeless actually have lower
victimization rates than those who are intermittently homeless, and attribute this to more
experienced homeless individuals taken more precautions to prevent victimization. Thus it may
be reasonable to take a proactive spatial approach in an attempt to reduce homeless crime risk, as
opposed to using reactive tactics to address the needs of homeless individuals after they have
been contacted by the police. Negative prior experiences with law enforcement tend to make
homeless individuals distrustful and intentionally avoid law enforcement (Stuart, 2016), and so it
may be necessary for police to proactively take steps to mitigate homeless victimization risk. As
such, RTM is an appropriate tool to identify both the spatial areas of high risk, as well as identify
environmental characteristics that increase risk of homeless related crimes.
RTM and Place Based Criminology
The theoretical motivation behind RTM is based on principles of environmental
criminology. At its core is an assumption that crime events occur when an offender and victim
meet in space, consistent with routine activities theory (Cohen & Felson, 1979). But, routine
activities theory fails to offer any explicit spatial predictions, as it was originally used to explain
macro level changes in victimization rates. Crime pattern theory provides more explicit spatial
predictions (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1993): while crimes are still determined where
victims and offenders meet in space, the chance of those meetings are more likely to occur in
specific spatial areas that are more frequently used by multiple individuals. Brantingham &

6
Brantingham (1993) expressed where those areas where multiple individuals are more likely to
meet via the environmental backcloth.
The environmental backcloth is made up of activity nodes in which individuals spend the
majority of their time; such as a place of residence and where they attend school or work. The
backcloth also includes paths between those nodes in which individuals travel. Those two areas
define an individual’s awareness space, which both predicts where offenders are likely to be
aware of particular targets, as well as be exposed to a higher probability of victimization.
There are two major conceptions as to how the environmental backcloth can influence the
spatial distribution of crime. The first is that the backcloth is highly predictive of where
individuals go during their routine activities. Thus, crime is more likely to occur at particular
places simply due to the convergence of more people in a smaller space. If one measures crime
as a rate, it may mean the rate is constant, but the overall number of crimes (the numerator)
varies over space because the denominator varies as well. Places with a larger number of
individuals (the denominator) are often referred to as crime generators (Brantingham &
Brantingham, 1995). While one can measure the denominator in various ways (Andresen, 2006;
Boggs, 1965; Gerell, 2018; Hipp, Tita, & Boggess, 2011; Malleson & Andresen, 2015), it is
generally difficult to defend any particular measure as correct. When considering people as the
unit at risk, they are highly dynamic within the day (Hipp, 2016; Hipp & Kim, 2019) and over
seasons (Linning, 2015). However, despite the potentially varying denominator over time, the
relative effect of such activity nodes on crime appears to be constant over the day or across
seasons (Haberman & Ratcliffe, 2015; Haberman, Sorg, & Ratcliffe, 2018).
It is also the case that not only do these crime generators influence crime at their exact
location, but also increase the frequency of crime in nearby places (Bowers, 2014). The

7
mechanism through which this diffusion takes place according to environmental criminology is
that for an individual to travel between activity nodes, they take regular paths. The paths of many
individuals may intersect, creating public areas with a high number of interactions, even if all
individuals are not travelling to the same destination. It is also the case that one’s risk of
victimization appears much higher when travelling (Lemieux & Felson, 2012). So for example,
ones risk of being robbed is likely higher walking from a bar to a parking lot, as opposed to when
they are inside the bar. Wheeler (2018b) showed that such spatial diffusion effects were often
larger than the local effects of bars, liquor stores, and convenience stores across many different
crime types. Given that homeless individuals are exposed in outdoor areas at a much higher rate
than non-homeless individuals, it seems reasonable to expect such diffusion to extend to
homeless related offending and victimization as well.
The second way that particular nodes may influence crime is that certain locations may
actually change behavior. Due to more vulnerable targets within a location, it may be that
motivated offenders are attracted to particular areas to commit a crime. For example, robbers
may be more likely to target individuals walking in open air drug markets, as they carry cash and
are not as likely to report the robbery to police (Bernasco & Block, 2010). These locations are
referred to as crime attractors (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1995). In practice it is often
difficult to tell the difference between a crime generator and a crime attractor, and places can
simultaneously be both.
Besides actually drawing a motivated offender into a particular space, it may also be the
case that a particular location may alter behavior in that space. What is considered reasonable
behavior in a crowded bar is not the same as in a children’s playground. Such an idea is
incorporated into several different crime theories. For example, within Newman’s (1973) theory

8
of defensible space, he provides different examples of how different types of shared corridors
can influence collective ownership of maintaining the area. In broken windows theory, the
physical appearance of a location can signal to individuals that no capable guardians are present,
and thus deviant behavior is more permissible (Wilson & Kelling, 1982). These are examples of
different behavior settings (Taylor, 2015). While it is difficult to explicitly define the borders of
behavior settings, they are likely influenced by being nearby different activity nodes (McCord et
al., 2007).
While the majority of the work in environmental criminology focuses on specific types of
crimes (Barnum et al., 2017; Connealy & Piza, 2019; Lersch, 2017), given that homeless are at
high risk of committing or being victimized across many different crime types, it is likely the
case that particular spatial risk factors are predictive across different crime types. Being
homeless results in much more exposure to potential victimization than those who have the
potential shelter of a home. The routine activities of the homeless are also heavily constrained by
the built environment. Such as panhandling being more likely to occur around businesses and
other places where people congregate (Scott, 2003). The built environment also constrains where
one can rest for long periods of time in semi-sheltered areas. Thus RTM is an appropriate tool to
identify those risk factors and generate a predictive model of future risk.
Finally, identifying spatial risk factors related to homeless crime offending or homeless
crime victimization can potentially change strategies intended to reduce risk related to homeless
populations. While RTM cannot explicitly dictate particular strategies, it is the first stage of
problem analysis (Piza, Kennedy, & Caplan, 2018). For example, if the locations of homeless
shelters are identified as both a location in which homeless victimization and homeless offending
is increased nearby, a police department may work directly with homeless shelters to identify

9
ways in which they can reduce risk (such as via crime prevention through environmental design).
This is opposed to arrest and citation based strategies, which may disperse the homeless to new
locations but are unlikely to solve any particular homeless crime problem long term (Vitale,
2010).
Data and Methods
Dependent Variable: Homeless Related Crimes
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has publicly available incident level crime
data geocoded to the address level (via the Los Angeles Open Data website,
https://data.lacity.org/). The LAPD crime data also provides information to determine whether
the incident was associated with a homeless offender, or whether the victim was homeless. The
incident data is recorded based on the victim and officers perception (Brantingham, 2016), so not
all homeless offenders were identified via arrest. The data for this study constructs the RTM
models based reported homeless crimes from 2013 through 2017, and uses 2018 data to test the
accuracy of the models.

We further disaggregate the risk models based on violent crime outcomes and property
crimes. Violent crimes include aggravated assault, forcible rape, murder, and robbery. Property
crime includes arson, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Table 1 displays the total

10
number of crimes by the two categories in the test sample (2013 through 2017), homeless
offending or victimization and violent or property crimes. While a crime incident may include
both a homeless offender or a homeless victim, the overlap of such events does not occur
frequently in this data. Fewer than 5% of the incidents analyzed in this sample involve both a
homeless victim and offender.
For the hold out 2018 sample there are a total of 6,307 homeless related crime incidents.
These are analyzed collectively, as the analysis will show that the identified risk factors tend to
be very similar across each of the four models.
Independent Variables: Crime Generators and Crime Attractors
Environmental characteristics that predict crime risk are broken down into either crime
generators or crime attractors. As discussed in the literature review, such labels are somewhat
arbitrary, but here are determined by whether all individuals likely access that service or area
(crime generator), or whether that service or area is more limited to those of lower socioeconomic status or specific to the homeless (crime attractor). Due to the divergence of
individuals using these facilities, we believe it is likely to influence the behavior settings of such
locations (Caplan et al., 2017), although we cannot rule out such places have higher risk simply
due to more homeless individuals interacting in a smaller space. While the labels are somewhat
arbitrary, they do not have an impact on the resulting RTM analysis. Whether an independent
factor is labelled as a crime generator or a crime attractor it undergoes the same variable
selection routine in the subsequent models.

11
Such variables were either collected from open data sources, or from Lexis Nexis
business listings. 1 All of these datasets were collected during the fall of 2018. While businesses
opening and closing creates potential error in these measures (a business opened in 2017 cannot
influence crime in 2016), we believe these errors are unlikely to greatly influence the results. The
places were businesses can locate are heavily influenced by restrictive zoning that was
established in LA long before the study period (Fishel, 2015). As such, even if one business
closes, it is likely replaced by a similar establishment. It is also the case that physical
infrastructure measures, such as sidewalks and bridges, also do not vary much over time. Table 2
lists the different independent variables used to predict homeless crime risk. There are a total of
20 different crime generator factors, and 6 different crime attractor factors.
Crime generators include areas that are potentially predictive of homeless encampments
or sleeping rough locations (alleys, bridges, sidewalks, parks, streets). They also include services
that homeless individuals frequently use, such as different public transit stations (bus stops,
DASH stops, Express stops, metro stations), and libraries. Such places have been shown in prior
work to correlate with crime (Groff & La Vigne, 2001; Wheeler, 2018b). Finally, crime
generators includes shopping places that homeless may either buy goods or potentially panhandle, such as convenience stores, drinking places, fast-food restaurants, gas stations, grocery
stores, liquor stores, tattoo parlors, and shopping centers. Such locations are generally predictive
of crime at micro places (Block & Block, 1995; Burgason et al., 2017; Haberman & Ratcliffe,
2015; Perenzin Askey et al., 2018; Wheeler, 2018b).

While we are unaware of any prior criminological study using Lexis Nexis business directory data specifically,
other crime and place based research has used commercial databases to obtain address level business listings
(Bernasco & Block, 2010).

Crime attractor locations include additional stores that homeless may utilize. Checkcashing stores, and laudromats are areas where risk of victimization may be increased due to
carrying cash (Kubrin & Hipp, 2016). The same applies to pawn shops, but also provides a
potential location to dispense of stolen goods. Homeless shelters likely increase the risk of crime
(Faraji et al., 2018) both to and from homeless individuals. Finally, past drug and past
prostitution arrests are typical indicators of crime attractors, as individuals who partake in such

13
illicit behavior tend to be more attractive targets, again due to carrying cash and being less likely
to report the victimization (Bernasco & Block, 2010). Homeless individuals are also more likely
to partake in such activities (Lee & Schreck, 2005).
Spatial Units of Analysis and RTM
RTM is a raster based approach to measure how different place based factors (the
previously discussed crime generators and crime attractors) are related to crime. As such, the
spatial unit of analysis are micro place grid cells over the study area. To determine the resolution
of the grid cells, we measured the mean length of a block in Los Angeles. This is approximately
480 feet, and so we constructed the grid cells to be half this size, 240 by 240 feet, which results
in a total of 235,351 spatial units of analysis over the area of Los Angeles.
RTM is a technique that predicts counts of crime aggregated to those grid cells using
count based regression models. Its main innovation is in two areas: first, it creates a consistent
way to operationalize the effect of different risk factors on crime (Caplan et al., 2011). It reduces
the effects of different crime generators to either proximity effects (i.e. a particular risk factor is
within 1,000 feet), or density effects (i.e. whether there is a large number of that type of risk
factor nearby). Table 2 displays whether the crime generator or attractor was operationalized as
proximity effects, density effects, or both. Risks factors that are not points are operationalized as
proximity. All other point patterns are operationalized as both proximity and density, with the
exception of past drug and prostitution arrests. These events are so numerous and spread over
Los Angeles that only measures of density would be reasonably predictive of future crime risk.
Given that one does not know generally a priori how far away a particular risk factor
effects crime, the independent variables are calculated at several different distance bandwidths.
Here we test six bandwidth distances of 240, 480, 720, 960, 1200, and 1440 feet.

14
Both proximity and density measures are converted to 0/1 indicators. Proximity effects
are calculated as 1 if the crime generator or attractor is within that particular distance bandwidth.
The density 0/1 variable is created by calculating a kernel density estimate of the risk factor over
the grid cells, using the distance bandwidth for the kernel estimator, z-scoring the density
surface, and then scoring a grid cell as a 1 if its z-score is two or more. Because of the consistent
operationalization of the spatial variables, effects can be easily interpreted in terms of the
increase in relative risks of predicted crime when that independent variable is present.
If one estimates a regression model including all of these factors it would result in a
regression analysis of 282 variables. 2 The second innovation in RTM is to use a novel variable
selection technique to result in a more interpretable risk assessment model (Kennedy, Caplan, &
Piza, 2010; Kennedy et al., 2016). First, a constrained regression approach is used to select
variables that have a positive coefficient on the crime outcome, using regularization to account
for the fact that many of the independent variables are correlated. Second, using a stepwise
procedure only one variable among the set of risk factors is chosen that minimizes the BIC
criteria. For example, there are twelve different variables that measure either the distance or
density of check cashing stores at the six different distance bandwidths. The stepwise procedure
only selects at maximum one of those twelve check-cashing variables that produces the best BIC
score. Finally, it chooses either a Poisson or negative binomial regression as the best fitting
model (again by the BIC metric). We use the RTMDx software provided by the original creators
of risk terrain modeling to conduct the regression analysis.

This includes 47 spatial risk factors (calculated by five risk factors measured as either proximity or density, and 21
risk factors measured as both proximity and density). Since each measure was calculated at six different distance
bins, this results is 47*6=282 variables.

15
Subsequently RTM produces an estimated risk map, but is an improvement over typical
hot spot maps in that it not only predicts areas of future high risk (Drawve, 2016), but also
identifies potential causal factors that contribute to crime risk. It also potentially identifies areas
that even if they are not currently hot spots of crime, are potential areas of crime displacement
due to similar criminogenic environmental characteristics.
Results
Figure 1 displays a kernel density map of all homeless related crime in Los Angeles. The
Skid Row neighborhood is highlighted in red on the map, and this establishes that while Skid
Row has the highest overall risk based on past crime incidents, a significant amount of homeless
crime risk extends beyond its borders. It is also the case that there are several different homeless
related crime hot spot areas around LA. While such a simple mapping technique can identify the
hot spots or specific areas to concentrate attention on, the following RTM analysis will identify
potential causal factors that can additionally aid in a problem oriented policing approach (Caplan
& Kennedy, 2016).

as being homeless. Included for reference are the location of City Council Districts, as well as
the outline of the Skid Row neighborhood (in red). KDE is calculated using a 3,000 foot
bandwidth.

17

Table 3 lists the model selection results of the RTM analysis applied to the four different
outcomes: violence against homeless, violence committed by the homeless, property crime
against homeless, and property crime committed by the homeless. Each risk type lists the
selected operationalization, either as a density (D) or proximity (P), along with the distance
threshold that resulted in the best fitting model. The table also includes the relative risk value
(RRV), comparing the added risk when that particular risk factor is present.
While several of the variables are not associated with any risk across all four models
(alleys, sidewalks, streets, and tattoo parlors), the rest of the crime generator or crime attractor
factors are significant contributors to homeless crime risk in at least one of the models. While
alleys, sidewalks, and streets are locations where it is expected homeless are more likely to
gather, they also are prevalent across most of the city, providing very little discrimination in
predictions between high and low homeless crime areas. While the majority of relative risk
factors are around the 1 to 2 range, several factors contribute to much higher estimated risk:
homeless shelters and areas of the highest density of past drug arrests. These largest factors are
consistent across each model, suggesting that these crime attractors contribute both to motivated
offenders as well as suitable targets.
The distance of these largest risk factors are spatially limited: past drug arrests are either
within 480 or 240 feet across each of the models. The effect of homeless shelters are selected at
the 480 and 720 foot bandwidths. The spatial operationalization changes though for homeless
shelters depending on the model, with crimes against homeless operationalized as proximity, but
offenses committed by homeless operationalized as density. This suggests that placing multiple

18
homeless shelters nearby one another increases homeless offending, but isolated homeless
shelters may still have high homeless victimization risk.

To simplify the results, we have placed the factors that had the highest risk associated
with each of the models (according to the relative risk values) in Table 4. Besides the already

19
mentioned past drug arrests and homeless shelters, Downtown DASH stops are within the top
five relative risk factors across each crime type. Such a risk factor may not indicate increased
risk when using a measure of the population using such services though (Gerrell, 2018).
Referring back to Table 3, the distance of the downtown DASH stops extends for a much larger
area though – the model selected when they were within 1,440 feet as the best fitting results for
each of the four models. Past prostitution arrests are within the top five risk factors for each
model, with the exception of property crime by the homeless, although it is a much smaller risk
factor than previous drug arrests.

Figure 2 displays the RTM predicted risk map, combining all four models. Upon visual
inspection of each individual risk map, they showed a large amount of spatial overlap, as would
be expected based on the consistency of the different risk factors. 3 The models were combined
by taking the logs of the predicted relative risk, z-scoring that logged value, adding the four z-

Another way to describe this overlap is to create binary high risk areas for each independent model (based on the
typically used threshold in RTM analysis of a z-score of over two in the predicted area). Doing this exercise for each
model, nearly 50% of the identified high risk areas were common to all four models.

scores together, and then dividing by four. Compared to the original kernel density map, this
provides a more detailed risk prediction surface based on the input crime generators. Although it
still identifies the area of highest risk in and around Skid Row, it illustrates how there is risk of
homeless related crime in multiple places around the city. While the overview map illustrates
how risk often concentrates around different street corridors, if one zooms into more specific
locations one can identify much higher risk scores around particular crime generators or
attractors, which help to further filter risk locations to prioritize different interventions.

23
Places can be identified as high risk based on the confluence of multiple factors in nearby
proximity, so cannot simply be attributed to one single factor. Figure 3 displays a zoomed in map
on the high risk area on Hollywood Blvd. (that is not within skid-row). The background light
purple areas display grid cells with a combined RTM risk score of over 2. This particular area
illustrates the high risk associated with multiple homeless shelters and other risk places in close
proximity. While bus stops are quite regular throughout the environment, several high risk areas
have liquor stores and shelters in close proximity. This zoomed in map does not display all of the
different factors that contribute to the elevated risk at the flagged areas, but shows how different
high risk areas can be characterized by different overlapping risky places (Connealy & Piza,
2019; Kennedy et al., 2016; Valasik et al., 2018).
The last analysis we conduct is to determine whether the RTM risk predictions can
effectively predict future crime. To do this we use the predictions generated by RTM based on
the 2013 through 2017 data, and then evaluate them against homeless related crimes (restricted
to the same property and violent crime categories) in 2018. Figure 4 displays the proportion of
area under the study on the X axis, and the Y axis displays the proportion of 2018 homeless
crimes captured based on the combined RTM risk score (Ohyama & Amemiya, 2018). So the
graph can be read as the top 5% of the RTM risk scores captures approximately 70% of the
homeless related crime in LA.
This graph can be viewed similarly weighted to receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
curves, where the weight is the number of crimes, and areas with zero crimes have a weight of
one (Mohler & Porter, 2018). Here the area-under-the-curve statistic is 0.925, with a 95%
confidence interval of 0.922 to 0.929. Setting the threshold to identifying high risk areas as
above 2 in the combined RTM risk score results in identifying 4% of the area in LA, and

24
captures 68% of homeless related crimes in 2018 (4,288 out of 6,307) for a predictive accuracy
index of over 17. This is excellent evidence that the predictions generated by RTM are effective
at forecasting future homeless related crime events.

based on 2013 to 2017 data) to capture a percent of homeless related crime in 2018. Area-underthe-curve statistic of 0.925.

Discussion
Using RTM we identified several different risk factors that were associated with
homeless related crime. The strongest risk factors to predict crime, prior drug arrests and
proximity to homeless shelters, are consistent across both property and violent crime types, as
well as homeless offending or victimization. Maps of homeless crime risk also illustrated that
while homeless related crime is concentrated in the Skid Row neighborhood, there are multiple
areas around Los Angeles that both a have a large number of homeless crime incidents, and were
predicted to have high homeless crime risk according to the RTM models. We discuss the
importance of these findings in terms of advancing the theory of crime at micro places, as well as
potential applications of the findings.
Of relevance to theoretical debates in environmental criminology, there is mixed
evidence whether one should consider spatial crime patterns as divergent among different types
of crime (Andresen & Linning, 2012; Haberman, 2017), or whether hot spots of crime tend be
diverse and overlap in space (Brantingham, 2016). We highlight here another potential way to
understand crime problems that do not focus on specific crime types, but that focus on a specific
group of individuals. The idea that it may be more appropriate to analyze crimes associated with
cognizable groups, as opposed to focusing on specific crime outcomes, is not new. Prior
examples are place based analysis of gang violence (Valasik, 2018) or juvenile offending
patterns (Bichler, Christie-Merrall, & Sechrest, 2011; Weisburd, Morris, & Groff, 2009). Given
the findings here that different place based characteristics have very similar effects on homeless
related crime, both across property/violent crimes and victim/offender categories, places
associated with homeless crime risk may be driving diversity of crime in particular hot spots, at
least in Los Angeles. The convergence of individuals who are both potentially motivated

26
offenders and suitable targets in a small area can contribute to excess risk among the homeless
population, making them a particularly vulnerable group.
This theoretical insight has implications for different strategies intended to mitigate
future crime risk committed by or against the homeless. One of the important findings of this
work is that risky homeless crime places are both a function of the homeless as offenders as well
as homeless victims. While arrest or citation based strategies may potentially deter homeless
offenders (Berk & MacDonald, 2010), they are unlikely to reduce the risk of homeless
victimization. At the incident level homeless offending and victimization rarely overlap
(homeless offenders victimizing other homeless), and so addressing homeless offenders will not
intrinsically reduce homeless victimization risk.
Another prominent risk factor related to homeless crime was that of homeless shelters.
While this is not surprising given past work (Faraji et al., 2018), we establish that this risk is due
to both more homeless being victimized, as well as more homeless offenders. We also establish
that the area of risk is limited to very nearby the homeless shelter, at either a selected distance of
480 or 720 feet for each model. Given that the smallest distance bandwidth of 240 feet was not
selected, this suggests that the homeless crime risk is not only limited to within the shelter itself,
but has a diffusion effect to the nearby environment. Thus while homeless shelters can likely
take particular steps to reduce homeless victimization within their shelter, there may be steps
shelters can take to reduce risk outside of the shelter as well. Additionally, we find that the
proximity was the selected operationalization for homeless victimization, whereas density was
the selected factor for homeless offending. This suggests that to reduce homeless offending one
strategy might be to avoid placing homeless shelters nearby to each other, but to spatially diffuse
them into larger areas.

27
The final consistent risk factor across the different models, Downtown DASH bus stops,
had a longer range in which they impacted crime, 1,440 feet. Thus any CPTED intervention that
targets risk around bus stops should not be limited to solely the bus stop, but should extend into
the environment nearby. This may also provide another opportunity to proactively identify
individuals, either as potential offenders or victims. It may also suggest different design based
strategies that can reduce the risk of victimization around the bus stops, such as street lighting
(Farrington & Welsh, 2002). It is the case though that such identified risk factors can be due to
differing populations using such services (Gerrell, 2018).
When interpreting the results one needs to keep in mind the limitations of the study. The
largest is that the analysis is cross-sectional, and subsequently the inferences that these place
based factors cause homeless related crime is weak. While it is the case that quasi-experimental
designs may provide stronger inferences on particular causal factors (Berk & MacDonald, 2010;
Faraji et al., 2018), these do not necessarily help in identifying more general causal crime factors
that contribute to homeless crime risk across all of Los Angeles. The risk factors identified by
this RTM analysis can be the first step in the problem identification stage for problem oriented
policing approaches to reduce future homeless crime risk (Piza et al., 2018). It is the case that
even if certain environmental variables are not the root cause of homeless crime problems, they
can still suggest potential intervention strategies.
One way in which such a simplistic cross-sectional analysis may lead one astray is that
the stated risk factors may not be entirely exogenous, and themselves may be caused by
homeless related crime or have some other spurious association. In particular, this is a strong
threat when using prior policing factors, such as drug and prostitution arrests. While these are
commonly used as crime attractor measures in previous crime and place research (Bernasco &

28
Block, 2010; Caplan, 2013), it may be the case that police have targeted homeless populations
for such offenses, and that explains the association. So increased drug use and prostitution is not
a cause of homeless related crime, but a consequence of policing the homeless (Vitale, 2010).
This threat is less likely the case though for more fixed aspects of the built environment and
commercial establishments, as they tend to be much more temporally stable over time.
A related limitation is that ultimately there could be additional risk factors we have not
included in this particular analysis. These omitted variables could potentially be confounds for
the place based risk factors that we did identify. For example, vacant homes may be places in
which homeless congregate and have increased risk (Spelman, 1993). We were unable to obtain
point level estimates of vacant homes in Los Angeles to incorporate into the analysis. Another is
the use of 311 calls as a measure of disorder (Caplan et al., 2015; O’Brien & Winship, 2017;
Wheeler, 2018a). This is particularly pertinent, as homeless encampments are often seen as
sources of physical disorder (Berk & MacDonald, 2010). Future work may attempt to identify
the overlap of such measures of physical disorder and crime, in an attempt to further identify
particular problem solving approaches to homeless related crime.
The last potential confound we have not incorporated in the analysis is demographic
factors in predicting homeless related crime risk. It is likely the case that particular demographic
factors are not only directly related to homeless crime risk (Dugato, Favarin, & Bosisio, 2018;
Giménez-Santana, Caplan, & Drawve, 2018; Kim, 2018), but may interact with the place based
characteristics that influence crime (Kennedy & Dugato, 2018; Smith, Frazee, & Davison, 2000;
Thomas & Drawve, 2018). An obviously meaningful demographic indicator we have not
incorporated in the analysis is an actual measure of the local homeless population. Currently
counts of homeless populations in LA are generated on a yearly basis and disseminated at the

29
larger levels of aggregation, such as census tracts and council areas (see
https://www.lahsa.org/homeless-count/). But these do not aid in providing micro area
predictions. Given the difficulties of accurately measuring the homeless population in small
areas we did not incorporate homeless estimates into the prediction (Kriegler & Berk, 2010), but
there clearly would be utility to doing so in future work.
These additional factors may both improve inferences as to what aspects of the built
environment increase homeless related crime risk, as well as potentially improve forecasts of
future areas of risk. Here we combine the four different models into one risk surface, and
illustrated that it was quite effective and predicting future homeless related crimes. We suspect
that incorporating all of the models increased predictive accuracy, as prior work has ensembled
different predictions with RTM and illustrated increases in predictive accuracy (Caplan et al.,
2019; Drawve et al., 2019). Although future work may further examine whether specific
offending or victimization is better predicted in isolation, or whether other models will provide
more accurate predictions in space and time.
Conclusion
Homeless individuals are uniquely exposed to a variety of different risks due to their
particular lifestyle. This is both in terms of property crime victimization or violent victimization.
In place of traditional policing, it may be interventions designed to reduce homeless
victimization risk, as opposed to preventing homeless crime offending, will be more fruitful.
Given the history of order maintenance policing strategies in LA, it is likely that using only
official reported crimes undercounts the actual prevalence of homeless victimization, as the
homeless often intentionally avoid police contact (Stuart, 2016). Even given this limitation

30
though it makes the most sense to target those identified spatial areas by RTM for interventions
intended to reduce homeless crime risk.
Homeless individuals being victimized provides a potential point where the criminal
justice system may intervene with homeless individuals. While informally officers have often
served this social work type role, especially when dealing with individuals on Skid Row (Bittner,
1967; Huey, 2007; White, 2010), given that areas of high drug and prostitution arrests are
predictive of homeless crime risk, it may be other social service agencies that can aid with
homeless related problems should be readily available to officers in those high risk areas.
This strategy relies on reactive policing tactics though; waiting for someone to be
victimized and then offering services. Given that proactive hot spot policing strategies tend to be
more successful in reducing crime (Braga, Papachristos, & Hureau, 2012; Braga, Welsh, &
Schnell, 2015), that same idea can likely be extended to tackling homeless crime risk. Instead of
focusing on citation based strategies to clear out homeless encampments (Chamard, 2010; Vitale,
2010; Stuart, 2016; Wilking et al., 2018), officers may attempt to reduce victimization risk in
these areas. Something as simple as providing the homeless with better services to store
valuables is likely a way to reduce property crime risk. Officers may proactively seek out
individuals who are at higher risk due to their particular belongings and then suggest such
services.
Additionally, the results of RTM can also be used by other non-police agencies to
identify priority targeted areas. The findings should be of interest to homeless shelters
themselves, as they will likely want to take steps to not only mitigate risk inside of the shelter,
but to nearby areas as well. Identified areas of high victimization risk are also areas that should
be prioritized to attempt to either provide services to shelter current individuals, or at least

31
provide other means through which the risk of this vulnerable population is mitigated to
whatever extent possible.
The current work can only be considered the start of identifying potential risk factors for
homeless crime risk, not the end. While such analysis can be helpful in identifying strategies,
ultimately those strategies need to be evaluated for their efficacy. We suspect going forward that
spatial policing strategies intended to address homeless related crime will need to go beyond
order maintenance based strategies given the limited utility of those prior strategies (Berk &
MacDonald, 2010; Braga et al., 2015). Given that homeless related crime involves both risk to
homeless individuals, as well as risk of homeless individuals committing crime, effective crime
reduction strategies likely need to consider both of these elements to effectively reduce homeless
related crime. While RTM often explicitly discusses focusing on places instead of people, it is
likely the case that to truly understand homeless related crime and its antecedents one needs to
understand both.
