In recent years, nontraditional workforce training programs have proliferated
inside and outside of traditional postsecondary institutions. A subset of these
programs, bootcamps, advertise high job placement rates and have been hailed
by policymakers as key to training skilled workers. However, few formal data exist
on the number, types, prices, location, or other descriptive details of program
offerings. We fill this void by studying the universe of bootcamp programs offered
as of June 30, 2017. In this report, we discuss the attributes of the 1,010 technologyrelated programs offered in the United States, Canada, and online. We find more
diversity among bootcamp providers and programs than would be expected
from public discourse. This primarily relates to the mode of delivery (online vs. in
person), intensity (part time/full time), cost, and program types. Based on the data
we collected, we present a classification structure for bootcamps focused on five
distinct program types.

RTI Press: Research Report

Introduction
Policymakers, business leaders, the public, and the
US government often echo the following refrain: the
American workforce lacks workers with technical
skills to fill the needs of employers as the country’s
jobs become less physically and more technologically
demanding. Preparing a 21st-century workforce
is a significant agenda item for policymakers and
educators—one that has received considerable
attention.1 However, traditional postsecondary
institutions are not well-equipped to fill these
vocational needs; they are typically unable to rapidly
respond to employers’ quickly changing skill and
credential requirements, and their programs are
cost- and/or time-prohibitive for many students.
This tension has fueled the emergence of “disruptive”
nontraditional education models such as massive
open online courses (MOOCs) and bootcamps/
coding academies.
Bootcamps have differentiated themselves through
short, intensive, in-person programs boasting both
high placement rates and high beginning salaries
(Lohr, 2015). According to popular media and
industry players, the bootcamp industry has grown
rapidly in the number and types of programs offered
since it started in 2012 (Eggleston, 2017). However,
despite the impact this emerging industry has made
on higher education over the past 6 years, the size
and scope of the sector and its impact remain unclear.
Until now, the only data on these programs and
outcomes of attendees have come from industryaffiliated groups.
Further limiting efforts to track their growth and
effectiveness, bootcamps are unaccredited and
therefore are not subject to the same governmental
regulations or oversight as other postsecondary
institutions—nor are they eligible for monetary
support. Yet, uncharacteristically, two recent federal
initiatives have paved the way for federal aid to
support students enrolled in bootcamp programs
(McKenzie, 2017; US Department of Education,
1

See, for example, statements from the current and previous presidential
administrations for context of the push for improved early career job
skills and training: (White House, 2016; Executive Order No. 13801 of
Jun 15, 2017).

2016). These funding mechanisms are being explored
despite a dearth of objective data on the programs
and only speculative debate on their efficacy
(McBride, 2016; Watters, 2012a).
In this report, we focus on technology-related
bootcamp programs. Our data collection and analyses
serve as the first comprehensive look at this new
educational sector. We assess the media/popular
perception of bootcamps and whether this depiction
matches the reality of what is happening in this sector.
Our data collection examined the following aspects
of bootcamps: number, types, and subject areas
of bootcamps; who provides bootcamp programs;
type of instructional delivery (in-person/online)
and intensity; cost of programs and availability of
financial aid; admissions processes; formal networks
of bootcamp providers; and location of programs.
The simplicity of our questions speaks to the almost
complete lack of data and research on bootcamp
programs. By establishing a descriptive baseline of
the landscape of bootcamp programs, this report
lays the foundation for further rigorous independent
research to accurately represent the entire sector.
With the size and scope of the universe having been
established, future research can delve into additional
characteristics and outcomes, both at the institution
or program level as well as at the student level. This
further research, which would build on the frame we
have established, could help policymakers, students,
and educational providers assess program efficacy,
affordability, and impact on evolving labor markets.

Background and Literature Review
We anchor our study within a larger, though relatively
scant, body of academic work on nontraditional
higher education offerings by discussing prior
research on related topics to learn about motivations
and challenges facing bootcamps and assess previous
efforts to collect data on bootcamps. First, we
summarize the history of bootcamps, based primarily
on media reports. Next, we examine research
on accreditation to consider the implications of
bootcamps’ nonaccredited status. Finally, we discuss
other types of alternative credential programs to
which bootcamps may be similar.

History and Evolution of Bootcamps
As noted previously, bootcamps have not been
rigorously studied. Thus, we rely on media
coverage to establish the history and evolution of
this educational model. Most reports reflect some
combination of popular perception and data from
industry organizations focused on recruiting new
students. As such, we recognize the limitations
inherent in relying on the media to establish this
history; the media’s portrayal does not always reflect
reality. In fact, that very concern motivated this work
and was borne out in our results. Hence, we present
this history with a cautionary note—there is likely
more to the evolution of bootcamps than we present
here.
In the late 2000s, providers of free, open-access
courses designed to help eager students learn to
code exploded onto the educational scene. By 2012,
a plethora of these courses (of varying quality)
were available to the public. But as Watters (2012a)
noted, one start-up, among many offering these free
resources, changed course in a surprising way in
2012. Turning away from the free, online content they
had been producing, Bloc began offering an 8-week
online developer “bootcamp” that cost $3,000, with
the rationale that by charging money, the program
could personalize learning. This pivot, from a free
resource to an intensive, costly learning program,
marked a shift in the industry, as other organizations
made similar changes. Since then, the bootcamp
model has proliferated as an educational option
(Watters, 2012b).
Initial media coverage conveyed a sense of awe at
this “disruptive” innovation and its potential to shake
up traditional higher education and the workforce
(Andrews, 2013; Oliver, 2012; Watters, 2012a) and fill
a sizeable skills gap (Rothwell, 2012; Watters, 2012b).
As employers and policymakers encouraged students
to enter technology fields, bootcamps became an
attractive option. This new model purported to
prepare new labor market entrants quickly and
effectively to fill well-paying jobs in fields with
tremendous demand. In 2015, the White House
estimated that there were 5 million unfilled jobs in
the United States, with 500,000 of those in “high-

technology areas like software development, network
administration and computer security” (Baker, 2015).
Employers’ needs for these skills is likely to intensify;
the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 13.1 percent
increase in jobs in “Computer and Mathematical”
occupations between 2014 and 2024 (compared with
a 6.5 percent increase in all jobs) (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2017). Nearly half (42 percent) of employers
had little confidence in traditional colleges and
universities to train students with the skills needed
for jobs in their industry (Hart Research Associates,
2015). Bootcamps, perhaps, could fill these needs.
Media coverage on bootcamps has been
particularly focused on their potential to change
the demographics of the tech industry’s talent pool.
The tech industry has well-documented gender and
racial imbalances, and bootcamps could diversify
educational pathways into the sector: approximately
18 percent of technology jobs and traditional
computer science bachelor’s degrees are held by
women, whereas 35 percent of students at bootcamps
are women (Lohr, 2015). Racial disparities persist,
however: just 1 percent of graduates from coding
bootcamps are black, reflecting a similar proportion
of black employees at major tech companies
like Facebook and Google (Kessler, 2015). Some
bootcamps, such as Telegraph Academy (of which
85 percent of students are underrepresented people of
color) and Black Girls Code, actively recruit and train
students of color to try to change the supply-side
demographics.
Bootcamps could also play a role in increasing access
to technology jobs. Although the media noted the
high cost of bootcamp programs, the prices were
typically mentioned as part of a theoretical costbenefit analysis (Korn & Weber, 2014; Truong, 2013;
Watters, 2012a). Were students getting a bargain by
substituting bootcamp programs for costly 4-year
computer science degrees that may not have led
to well-paying jobs in technology fields? Or were
bootcamps taking advantage of students looking for a
faster way to get a good job?
Since early media enthusiasm has mellowed, coverage
has included more skepticism about bootcamps’
educational models and unaccredited status.

RTI Press: Research Report

Articles have questioned their job placement rates,
efficacy, quality, and ability to self-regulate (Craig,
2014; Truong, 2013). The Wall Street Journal (Korn
& Weber, 2014) reported a bootcamp backlash:
employers who had hired some bootcamp graduates
described their skills as inadequate. From these
employers’ view, high-intensity, short-duration
courses were not sufficient for students to learn the
fundamentals and specifics of programming from
scratch.
Over time, the media presented a more nuanced
view of traditional computer science bachelor’s
degree programs and bootcamp programs.
Whereas bootcamps generally focused on practical
skills, bachelor’s degree programs offered a more
comprehensive education that included computer
science theory. Students coming out of traditional
programs often required some “hand-holding” to get
up to speed (Lewin, 2014; Lohr, 2015). Graduates of
bootcamps had practical skills but little grounding
in computer science fundamentals, limiting their
value as employees (McBride, 2016; Nichols, 2015).
Regardless, high-quality bootcamps were filling a
need that traditional education had not (Lewin,
2014).
Recognizing the ways in which bootcamps were
potentially filling skills gaps and the growing
influence of this alternative educational approach,
the federal government introduced new policies
related to the bootcamp industry in 2015. First,
the White House launched TechHire, an initiative
focused on regions with more than 120,000 open
technology jobs, to match students in those areas with
training programs to fill job openings; a handful of
coding bootcamps were identified as partners in this
effort (The White House, 2015). Both the Post-9/11
and “Forever” G.I. Bills allow veterans to use their
educational benefits at certain alternative education
providers, including bootcamps (McKenzie, 2017).
Also in 2015, the US Department of Education
began the Educational Quality through Innovation
Partnerships initiative, an experiment that offers
federal funding to students enrolled in programs
offered by nontraditional education providers—
four of which were bootcamps—that partnered

with traditional (Title-IV eligible) postsecondary
institutions (US Department of Education, 2015,
2016). The initiative included a partnership between
The Flatiron School and State University of New
York (SUNY) Empire State College to offer a web
development certificate program, with coursework
provided by SUNY Empire State College and The
Flatiron School (US Department of Education, 2016).
The partnership allows The Flatiron School access to
Empire State College’s accreditation and bootcamp
students access to federal financial aid, and provides
Empire State College students access to a bootcamp
as either a certificate or as part of their associate’s or
bachelor’s degree coursework (SUNY Empire State
College, 2016).
These initiatives were met with resistance from those
concerned about introducing federal funding into an
unregulated market, pointing to for-profit colleges
that had left students in debt and poorly prepared for
quality jobs (Schmidt, 2015; Shireman, 2015). Critics
argued that without accountability and oversight or
transparent and reliable data on student outcomes,
monitoring quality would be difficult, creating
opportunities for scandal (Kirkham, 2015; Smith,
2015).
In the past few years, as bootcamps have worked
to establish their legitimacy and effectiveness to
appeal to traditional postsecondary institutions and
policymakers, the industry continues to experience
rapid changes. Several well-known bootcamps closed
abruptly in the summer of 2017, leaving experts to
ponder the industry’s future.2 Traditional universities
are beginning to compete directly with bootcamps;
some have launched bootcamp programs of their
own, whereas others have changed their 4-year
computer science degree curriculum to more directly
address the skills gaps bootcamps seek to fill. While
overall growth in the bootcamp sector continues
(Eggleston, 2017), future growth and potential public
policy changes in this sector are unclear.
2

Notably, two of the more recognizable bootcamps, Dev Bootcamp
and IronYard, announced their closures 2 weeks after the end of
data collection. Since then, focus in the popular media has turned to
predicting whether these closures are an anomaly or signal a significant
shift (most likely, consolidation) in the market (Young, 2017).

RTI Press: Research Report

Arbeit et al., 2019

Accreditation
The accreditation of postsecondary institutions is
designed to ensure that students receive a highquality education, based on a rigorous set of
standards. In addition, accreditation serves as a
mechanism for institutions to gain access to federal
funding. One of the hallmarks of bootcamps is
that they, unlike nearly all other higher education
institutions, eschew accreditation. In a review of the
accreditation process in postsecondary education,
Alstete (2004) wrote that “accreditation is required for
recognition by governmental agencies, demanded by
students, parents, and the community, and changing
and evolving into an increasingly comprehensive
system of self-renewal for institutions.” However,
although accreditation is often considered to
be synonymous with quality assurance, there is
some debate over its effectiveness. The American
Council of Trustees and Alumni (2007) asserts that
“accreditation does nothing to ensure educational
quality” (p. 5), noting growing concerns about college
quality and graduates’ lack of employer-desired skills.
Accreditation is a voluntary process but opting out
carries significant consequences for both institutions
and students. Most notably, nonaccredited
institutions have traditionally been ineligible for
federal funding, including federal institutional grants
and student federal financial aid (Alstete, 2004).
By opting not to pursue accreditation, however,
bootcamps free up resources (both in terms of money
and labor hours) and maintain control over many
aspects of the educational model, from data collection
and reporting to program length requirements,
which allows them more flexibility to meet current
workforce and student learning needs. Recent
federal initiatives loosening regulations that prohibit
financial aid for students of nonaccredited institutions
may make accreditation obsolete for alternative
providers, and may foretell a significant shift in higher
education’s funding structure as these nontraditional
providers continue to gain traction.
As bootcamps take seriously the need to publish
externally audited outcomes data and address
concerns about quality and transparency, new
initiatives seeking to standardize outcomes reporting

RTI Press Publication No. RR-0033-1902. Research Triangle Park, NC: RTI Press.

have emerged from within the bootcamp industry.
The Council on Integrity in Results Reporting
(CIRR), a nonprofit organization representing a
coalition of bootcamps that have committed to a clear,
standardized approach to collecting and reporting
student academic and employment outcome data for
their students, formed in 2017 (Fain, 2015a; CIRR,
2017).3 Separately, a 25-member task force has
drafted its own set of quality assurance standards and
completed a public comment phase (Wan, 2017).
Bootcamps are also following regulatory processes in
states that require them, including California where
the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary
Education approves providers based on “integrity,
financial stability, and educational quality,
including…appropriate assessment of students’
achievement prior to, during, and at the end of
[programs]” (Bureau for Private Postsecondary
Education, n.d.). General Assembly, the largest
bootcamp, went through the state regulatory process
in eight states, reportedly finding the process to
be beneficial in standardizing and improving their
operations (Fain, 2015b).
Alternative Credential Programs
Bootcamps are not the first alternatives to traditional
postsecondary degrees, as both the diversity of
offerings and the number of students pursuing
alternative options have grown over the past decade
(Brown & Kurzweil, 2017). However, research in
this area is rare and generally limited to credentials
awarded upon completion of a credential program
(certificates) at accredited postsecondary institutions
or a successful demonstration of skills through
professional organizations (licenses and certifications)
(Bielick et al., 2013; Ewert & Kominski, 2014).
Despite a significant federal effort through the
Interagency Working Group on Expanded Measures
of Enrollment and Attainment (or GEMEnA) to
collect better data on alternative credentials, the
definition of alternative credentials used in federal
3

These statistics include a description of graduation requirements,
graduation rates, the percentage of graduates employed by whether
their job is in their field of study and work intensity, graduate job title
and salary, and the percentage of incoming students who hold a prior
computer science degree.

RTI Press: Research Report

surveys specifically excludes bootcamps by focusing
on certificates, and certifications and licenses and
thus on community colleges, other universities or
colleges, trade schools or professional organizations
(Bielick et al., 2013).4
Recently, several efforts have included additional
forms of alternative credentials. Brown and Kurzweil
(2017) and Credential Engine (2018) acknowledged
other types of alternative credentials and educational
pathways, including microdegrees, digital badges,
nanodegrees,5 MOOCs, and bootcamps—regardless
of where they are offered. However, while both the
authors provide some context for the universe of
alternative credentials, they do not collect or report
new data on bootcamps (Brown & Kurzweil, 2017;
Credential Engine, 2018). Powers (2017) estimates
that over 46 million people have earned an “Open
Source Micro Diploma,” while Thayer and Ko
(2017) qualitatively analyze the challenges faced
by students enrolled in coding bootcamps, Fain
(2018) describes why alternative credentials in
general are important in the current labor market,
and Radford et al. (2014) assess employer receptivity
to MOOCs when making hiring decisions.
Overall, we find the existing academic research on
alternative credentials and pathways to be sorely
lacking. Although the accreditation literature
provides regulatory context, the existing research
has not sufficiently addressed newer alternative
credentials, particularly those outside of accredited
institutions. Without independent, methodologically
sound research driving the conversation surrounding
bootcamps and other alternative credential programs,
the limited sources of information on these types
of programs are amplified in the media hype—and
gloom—that surrounds them.

4

The GEMEnA efforts to quantify alternative credentials started in 2009,
led to a pilot survey in 2010, and resulted in a report issued in 2013. In
the more than 8 years since the pilot survey and 5 years since the report
was issued, alternative credentials have changed rapidly; the definitions
GEMEnA created do not encompass bootcamps and other newer
credentials.
5 Microdegrees, digital badges, and nanodegrees are all examples of
alternative certificates presented upon completion of short courses
completed online that can be shared on social media or with
employers.

Technology-Related “Bootcamps”

Existing Data
One reason for the dearth of academic research on
bootcamps is the lack of available data; the data that
do exist are produced by the industry for marketing
purposes, not independent research. As of this
writing, three organizations have collected and
published basic statistics on the bootcamp industry:
Course Report, Switchup, and CIRR.
Course Report and Switchup are industry
organizations operating directories for prospective
bootcamp participants. Course Report published
a Market Sizing Report in both 2016 and 2017 to
quantify the growth of coding and data science
bootcamps in the US and Canada (Eggleston,
2016a, 2017). In addition, Course Report publishes
an annual report on outcomes and demographics
of coding bootcamp alumni (Eggleston, 2016b).
These statistics are cited in virtually every current
publication on the topic (Pender, 2017; Brown &
Kurzweil, 2017; Credential Engine, 2018; Thayer
& Ko, 2017; Watters, 2017). Course Report’s data
are based on 95 coding bootcamps that reported
graduating an estimated 22,900 students in 2017
(Eggleston, 2017). Switchup conducted voluntary
surveys of about 826 bootcamp graduates from
76 full-time, in-person, programming or software
engineering bootcamps between 2014 and 2016
(Switchup, 2016).
Both Course Report and Switchup use a narrow
definition, focusing on full-time coding bootcamps
(Eggleston, 2017; Switchup, 2016). These programs
most closely align with media coverage; however,
there is no evidence that these programs represent
the industry in terms of enrollment. Because our goal
is to understand and describe the entire bootcamp
industry as opposed to one specific type of program,
we use a broader definition that includes part-time,
online, and international programs. Many of the
providers in our database offer multiple types of
programs; thus, adopting the narrower definition
used by Course Report and Switchup would ignore a
significant segment of the industry.
By all appearances, Course Report’s and Switchup’s
primary focus is recruiting potential bootcamp

6

participants. Their websites include searchable
bootcamp directories, reviews from graduates, and
top 10 lists. The Course Report (2018) website is
designed to help prospective students “find the best
bootcamp for [them].”6
As noted previously, CIRR represents a coalition
of bootcamps that have committed to a set of data
quality standards. CIRR’s first outcomes report was
drawn from data provided by 13 reporting member
bootcamps on their graduates in 2016. According to
CIRR’s report, 80 percent of graduates were placed in
an in-field job within 180 days of graduation with an
average starting salary of $70,412 (CIRR, 2017).
Whether the outcomes reported by these
organizations are representative of the industry
is unclear, but all three data sources likely suffer
from selection bias. Established or higher quality
bootcamps may be more likely to collect and report
accurate data than newer or less effective bootcamps.
The quality of the data collected and the extent to
which the data accurately represent all bootcamp
participants is unknown. Further, data collected for
market research purposes may not be suitable for
analysis due to a variety of potential methodological
biases.
The collection of comprehensive data by an
objective, third-party source is well past due to
establish the landscape of this burgeoning field.
Brown and Kurzweil (2017) and Credential Engine
(2018) illustrate this need; these reviews of alternative
postsecondary programs cited only Course Report’s
data on bootcamps, based on Course Report’s narrow
definition, despite the authors’ otherwise broader
focus. Whether these data are robust and reliable
is impossible to evaluate without other sources of
information by which to compare.
Independent Data Collection
Our research contributes an impartial scholarly
perspective in pursuit of a fresh, critical view of
bootcamp programs. In doing so, we challenge
popular and industry assumptions and commonly

held beliefs about this rapidly changing field.
This work advances our understanding and
encourages more transparency from an opaque
and heterogeneous mix of bootcamp providers and
programs. Our work has one primary purpose:
to objectively describe the universe of bootcamp
providers and programs worldwide. Without a
comprehensive understanding of these providers and
the programs they offer, the dialog will continue to
be driven by media coverage, popular perception,
and the subgroup of providers on which data are
currently collected by industry groups. In this report,
we describe:
1. the size of the bootcamp provider universe;
2. the type and number of programs and subjects
offered;
3. the characteristics of these programs, including
intensity, length, location, program area, price,
financial aid offerings, and industry affiliations.

Data and Methods

2017 Bootcamp Universe Study: Data
Collection
We started the data collection for the “2017
Bootcamp Universe Study,” by generating a list of
the information we aimed to collect about each
bootcamp program. The dataset we created included
columns for each data element (e.g., program length,
price, and location), and rows for each program. We
gathered the data on programs by visiting the website
for each bootcamp institution (or provider) and each
program offering. By the end of data collection, we
had amassed data on approximately 1,400 programs
offered by roughly 270 bootcamps worldwide.
Our dataset represents the universe of technologyrelated programs as of June 30, 2017. Data collection
began in November 2016. Starting in March 2017, we
revisited the websites for each bootcamp on which
we had already collected data, updating or filling
in missing data as needed. To ensure that the data

and Switchup directories and performed additional

RTI Press: Research Report

internet searches to check for new bootcamps or
those we had previously missed.
We started with bootcamps listed in the Course
Report and Switchup directories. Next, we turned to
the directories provided by Skills Fund and Climb
Credit, two private lenders focused on loans for
bootcamp students. Finally, we used Internet searches
and a snowball technique to identify additional
bootcamps not listed in any of these directories.
In this data collection, we used bootcamp websites
to identify the courses offered at each bootcamp;
each unique course offering (based on curriculum,
intensity, length, and location) was considered a
program.
Out-of-Scope Programs
Given the relative lack of definition around bootcamp
programs, we set specific parameters to define
whether a program was out of scope for the study.
To be included, all programs had to be unaccredited,
cohort based, and directed at adult learners; last
a minimum of 1 week; and contain direct and
substantial interaction with instructors or mentors.
Programs also had to be technology-specific, such
as coding or data science bootcamps. Thus, the
following characteristics led to a program being
labeled as out of scope and not included in further
data collection or analysis:
1. Programs that were no longer offered and
bootcamps that had closed before June 30, 2017.
2. Content was not related to science, engineering,
math, or technology.
3. Programs were too short (less than one week).
4. Programs or bootcamps did not target adult
learners.
5. Courses were eligible for university credit (unless
a bootcamp developed the content and partnered
with traditional institutions to provide it).
6. Programs or bootcamps provided insufficient
information on our key data elements.
Table A.1 (in the Appendix) provides reasons why
programs were determined to be out of scope
(although, due to inherent limitations, this is not a
representative sample of all out-of-scope programs).

Technology-Related “Bootcamps”

Due to incomplete information on one or more of
these key characteristics, we excluded 54 (of 1,441)
programs otherwise determined to be in scope: of
these, 20 were missing intensity, 45 were missing
length, and 10 were missing location. Overall, we
collected data on more than 2,000 programs at
more than 500 bootcamps, including 900 that were
ultimately excluded; 368 of these were no longer
offered, and the remaining 532 were deemed out of
scope for some other reason.
Data Elements
For every in-scope program, we collected four key
characteristics: intensity (full-time or part-time),
length, location, and program area. Program area
includes three broad categories: software engineering,
data science or engineering, and information
technology/security. Software engineering was
further broken down into web development,
software/web design, mobile app development,
software development/engineering, and other. For
programs in the United States, Canada, or online, we
also collected information on price (if denominated
in US or Canadian dollars), admissions process
(whether programs were competitive, had minimal
requirements, or had no requirements), populations
targeted in marketing materials or scholarships, CIRR
affiliation, and type of financial aid offered (if any).
Using these data, we developed a classification
schema with five distinct categories that encompass
each in-scope bootcamp program. These categories
are based on a thorough review of the data we had
collected on data on program length, intensity,
goals, and institutional affiliation. The categories and
definitions are as follows:
1. Comprehensive Career Preparation Program: a
program that advertises an intensive curriculum
in which students graduate ready to be employed
in the industry. Comprehensive career preparation
programs are full- or part-time vocational
programs offering comprehensive workforce
skills with no official credential-based admissions
requirements.
2. Course: a standalone course for specific, limited
skills; not intended for students looking for a
career change. While these programs are offered

https://doi.org/10.3768/rtipress.2018.rr.0033.1902

8

RTI Press: Research Report

Arbeit et al., 2019

at independent bootcamps, they resemble a single
traditional college course in curricular scope.
3. University-Affiliated Program: an unaccredited
program (not eligible for university credit)
affiliated with a traditional university.
4. Fellowship Program: often tuition free, a program
that focuses on improving existing expertise,
collaborating with other experts, and solving realworld problems. These often have credential-based
admissions requirements.
5. Postsecondary Education Replacement Program:
a full-time program lasting at least 1 year with an
involved admissions process. These are similar in
time investment to a traditional postsecondary
degree and self-identify as an alternative to a
traditional degree program.

Data Strengths and Weaknesses
Our data collection is the first comprehensive data
collection focused on bootcamps conducted by an
independent organization. Bootcamps cannot opt
in or out and do not need to subscribe or consent
for inclusion. The data collection is based entirely
on information provided in marketing materials on
program websites and, as such, treats each program
equally. Thus, these data can be used to validate and
update previous claims about the size of the industry
and the types, characteristics, and prices of programs
offered and provide additional detail on the options
that potential students have. Our study thus fills an
important void in a body of research that to date has
been dominated by industry groups.
Our data include the universe of bootcamp programs
on June 30, 2017, to provide stakeholders with crucial
information about these providers and programs.
To build our dataset, we gathered information
from more than 500 websites, written in multiple
languages, beginning by working from four existing
online directories and augmenting those lists with our
own web searches. As in any extensive baseline data
collection, we may have missed some of the smaller
providers, particularly small providers outside of
North America. In addition, although we used the
translate feature in our search engines, we may also
have missed some providers and/or been unable

RTI Press Publication No. RR-0033-1902. Research Triangle Park, NC: RTI Press.

to collect some data elements for providers with
websites primarily in a language other than English.
The data we collected were constrained by public
availability. Some data were missing or lacked
important details. For example, price was missing
for 10 percent of programs, and other basic program
characteristics were missing for some programs
as detailed above. While we gathered financial aid
information for all programs, on most websites,
the information on financial aid was limited to
whether scholarships are offered. Thus, the available
information on aid yielded little data on how many
students receive aid or in what amounts. In addition,
we abandoned data collection on other variables
deserving study after encountering inconsistent
availability; these include tax status (nonprofit/
for-profit), year founded, venture capital/corporate
funding, job placement statistics, and internship
opportunities.

Methods
We examine bootcamps at both the bootcamp
(provider) and program levels. Provider-level analyses
allow us to look at the breadth of offerings at both
the typical bootcamp and larger bootcamps. In
addition, these analyses allow us to consider whether
the industry is driven by a small number of large
bootcamps or by many small bootcamps. Programlevel analyses allow us to quantify the overall number
of program offerings and identify patterns for
programs with certain characteristics.
A program is a unique course of study within a
bootcamp provider, based on curriculum, intensity,
length, and location. Thus, a Web Development
Immersive program offered by Tech Talent South
in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, both full and
part time, and in Wilmington, Delaware, only full
time, is considered three programs. This reflects the
options that potential students face when looking at
programs. It also poses a limitation to our approach
since we describe programs without the context of
program size. Because bootcamps rarely publish
how many students enroll in each program or how
often programs are offered, we may be counting
equally programs that are offered once per year for 10

https://doi.org/10.3768/rtipress.2018.rr.0033.1902

RTI Press: Research Report

Technology-Related “Bootcamps”

students and programs that are offered 10 times per
year for 20 students at a time. However, delineating
the universe of programs is necessary before
collecting student-level data.
Additionally, we examine the distribution of
bootcamp programs across regional labor markets,
defined by core-based statistical area (CBSA)
(equivalent to a metropolitan area). These analyses
show whether the industry is concentrated within
certain labor markets and make comparisons to
where tech industry jobs are located. Aggregations
to CBSA are made using a crosswalk from the US
Census Bureau (2015).
The statistics produced for this report are descriptive.
Because they are based on a universe rather than a
sample, statistical tests were not appropriate.

Analyses and Findings

Results
We identified 1,387 unique programs offered in
48 countries, 44 US states, and online. From this list,
we classified the programs into five types (described
previously): comprehensive career preparation
programs (774 worldwide, 56 percent of programs);
courses (485, 35 percent); university-affiliated
programs (71, 5 percent); fellowship programs (52,
4 percent); and postsecondary education replacement
programs (5, 0.4 percent) (Figure 1). Then, we
identified the subject area taught: worldwide,
81 percent of programs taught computer science and
a majority (59 percent) of all programs taught web
development (Figure 1). We found fewer programs
teaching data science/engineering (17 percent) or
information technology/security (2 percent).

The distribution of the programs in the United States, Canada, and
online is similar to the worldwide distribution. We focus on US,
Canadian, and online programs due to concerns about coverage,
particularly for smaller bootcamps or those that advertise in a
language other than English. See the section on Data Strengths and
Weaknesses for a discussion of these issues. For more statistics on
the program types and subject areas offered in different regions, see

Bootcamp Courses
In addition to comprehensive
career preparation programs,
388 courses were offered at
70 different bootcamps in
the United States, Canada, or
online (Table 1). These shorter
programs aimed to teach a
specific skill or programming
language (for beginning or
advanced students) instead
of leading to a specific job or
career. Alternatively, bootcamps
offered courses as introductions
for students to try before
committing to a comprehensive
career preparation program,
to give comprehensive career
preparation program graduates
a chance to learn a new skill,
or as standalone courses. As
mentioned previously, we
found that most bootcamps
offering courses also offered
a comprehensive career
preparation program.

The courses bootcamps offered
contained similar content to
that of comprehensive career preparation programs:
78 percent were in computer science, with most
in web development. However, more than one in
five courses were in data science/engineering in
contrast to only 10 percent of comprehensive career
preparation programs. Most courses were part time
(93 percent), were delivered in person (81 percent),
and lasted an average of 8 weeks.

Price/Financial Aid
Courses cost less than comprehensive career
preparatory programs, reflecting the more focused
curriculum. The median price of a course was $2,567
and the interquartile range was $1,250 to $3,950;
longer programs typically had higher prices.
Financial aid was somewhat less common for courses
though most (77 percent) offered aid of some kind.

courses, and Climb Credit was offered for 36 percent
of courses. Scholarships were offered for 22 percent of
courses.
Admissions Criteria
Courses were more accessible than comprehensive
career preparation programs. Thirty-nine percent
of courses had no requirements for admission,
while an additional 45 percent had only minimal
requirements. Only the remaining 15 percent had
competitive admission requirements.

Other Bootcamp Programs
This section focuses on two other types of bootcamp
programs: university-affiliated programs and
fellowship programs. Postsecondary education
replacement programs were included in our study
and definition but omitted here as there were very few
(four) of such programs.

RTI Press: Research Report

University-Affiliated Programs
University-affiliated programs are unaccredited
programs offered by an accredited university
(usually with a well-known name). These are often
offered through a continuing education or extension
school. We identified 71 of these programs; of these,
48, or 68 percent, were operated by Trilogy Education
Services (TES). TES programs were branded in
alignment with each university (e.g., UT Austin
Boot Camp) but shared common formats (length,
areas, intensity) and marketing materials, including
websites, changed only to match the name and
colors of the host institutions. They also appear to be
similarly priced, although most did not provide price
data on their website or marketing materials.
Students at university-affiliated programs may believe
the programs they are attending are credentials
offered by the affiliated university. Research on
for-profit colleges has found that students largely
fail to distinguish between for-profit and nonprofit
institutions (Hagelskamp, Schleifer, & DiStasi, 2014);
this could also be happening with university-affiliated
bootcamps.
Unlike comprehensive career preparation programs,
most university-affiliated programs were part time
(68 percent) (Table 1). University-affiliated programs’
fields of study were similar to those of comprehensive
career preparation programs and bootcamp courses:
82 percent were in computer science, with 70 percent
in web development and 15 percent in data science/
engineering. Part-time programs lasted an average of
21 weeks, while full-time programs lasted an average
of 12 weeks. TES-affiliated institutions all offered a
part-time program, and some offered a similar fulltime program. All university-affiliated programs we
identified were delivered in person.
Fellowship Programs
Fellowship programs are generally tuition free and
are aimed at degree-seeking students/graduates or
professionals with prior experience in a field. They
focus on broadening students’ existing skillsets and
solving real-world problems to prepare individuals for
careers. We identified 40 fellowship programs. Unlike
the other program types, 58 percent of fellowship
programs were in data science/engineering (Table 1).
RTI Press Publication No. RR-0033-1902. Research Triangle Park, NC: RTI Press.

Technology-Related “Bootcamps”

17

Many of these focused on turning bachelor’s or higher
degree holders with high-level quantitative skills into
industry-ready data scientists. Forty-three percent
of fellowship programs were in software engineering
and 20 percent of programs were in mobile app
development, the highest proportion of any program
type. Nearly all (95 percent) fellowship programs
were full time, and the average full-time program
lasted 10 weeks. Most fellowship programs were free
(the median price was $0), and the average price
was $2,973. Nearly all (93 percent) of programs were
delivered in person.

Bootcamp Geography
Bootcamp programs have the potential to provide
job training in economically depressed areas, but
only if they are accessible to students in those areas.
Given how many bootcamp programs are offered in
person, location is a critical component of access.
Our geographic analyses identified 798 US-based
programs offered in 68 different CBSAs across 44
states. The 405 comprehensive career preparation
programs in the United States were similarly
distributed across 64 CBSAs. Figure 11 and Table A.6
show the distribution of comprehensive career
preparation programs, by CBSA.
Although programs were offered in nearly every
state, programs were concentrated in only a few
CBSAs. The top 10 CSBSAs accounted for more
than half (54 percent) of all bootcamp programs
and comprehensive career preparation programs
(50 percent). The New York–Newark–Jersey City,
NY-NJ-PA CBSA, which accounts for slightly more
than 4 percent of the US population, was home to
13 percent of programs offered and 12 percent of
comprehensive career preparation programs.
Some stakeholders have hypothesized that bootcamps
are responding to labor markets where demand for
technology jobs is not being met. Figure 12 compares
the distribution of comprehensive career preparation
programs and jobs in computer and mathematical
occupations, by US CBSA. Figures 11 and 12 show
that there is a correlation between the number of
bootcamps in a metropolitan region and the number
of jobs in computer and mathematical occupations:
more populous regions have more of both. However,

some regions are relatively underserved (those above
the trendline in Figure 12) by bootcamps—relative
to the number of jobs in computer and mathematical
occupations—and others are overserved (those below
the trendline in Figure 12). The Dallas/Fort Worth
area, for example, has seven comprehensive career
preparation programs and 140,000 computer or
mathematical jobs, whereas the Denver area has 16
programs and 67,000 jobs. In short, concentration
of comprehensive career preparation programs does
not align as well with the labor market demand as
would be expected based on media coverage. Further
research should analyze whether bootcamps are
responding to local labor needs.

Comparison to Existing Data (Course Report)
We report results from the first independent data
collection to quantify the scale and characteristics
of bootcamp programs. Since 2014, Course Report,
an industry-affiliated organization, has published

19

reports on the industry. In this section, we align our
data with the definitions used in Course Report’s
latest Market Sizing Report to compare our results to
theirs (Eggleston, 2017). We find that aligning our
data to theirs yields comparable statistics but excludes
sizeable parts of the industry. The Course Report
definition includes only 24 percent of the 1,010
programs in our data.
Course Report’s definition includes programs that are
unaccredited, based in the US or Canada, full time, in
person, and focused on full-stack web development,
mobile development, or front-end web development.
This excludes the 56 percent of programs that were
part time, 15 percent that were online, and 43 percent
that focused on different subjects. Using the
restricted definition, we find results nearly identical
to Course Report’s. We find 240 programs offered
at 98 bootcamps; Course Report reports identified
95 bootcamps (Table A.7). The average price of a
program in the subset aligned with Course Report

Discussion and Conclusion
Bootcamps have been portrayed at their best as
an innovative new educational model that may be
poised to disrupt the education industry. They are
characterized at their worst as fly-by-night for-profits
with all the transparency, effectiveness, and staying
power of technology start-ups during the dot com
boom. Our work sought to bring these institutions
into focus by providing clear, factual information
about their structure, program offerings, and other
institutional characteristics. Because of this research,
we no longer need to rely on industry groups or the
media to provide this basic information and can
thus dispel some of the myths surrounding these
educational providers.
For example, bootcamps are typically depicted
as short, intense, vocational coding and webdevelopment programs designed for students who are
looking to move into high-skill technology careers
through a single comprehensive program. In fact, the
program type that most closely resembles the media’s
portrayal of a typical bootcamp—comprehensive
career preparation programs—comprises only
50 percent of all programs offered by bootcamps
in the US, Canada, or online. The other half of
bootcamp program offerings, however, defy this
depiction. About 38 percent of programs are courses,
which are not intended for career changers and
resemble single college courses in the amount of
material presented. Seven percent of programs are
offered by traditional accredited institutions but are
ineligible for university credit; and about 4 percent of
programs are fellowship programs or postsecondary
education replacement programs, which both have
intense admissions processes and are designed for

RTI Press: Research Report

individuals with specific skills. The subject areas these
institutions teach extend beyond web development,
also encompassing data science and information
technology/security.
Our data also reveal the extent to which General
Assembly dominates the bootcamp market; an
important consideration as the federal government
experiments with expanding access to financial aid
or providing other pathways to federal aid for these
for-profit entities. Similarly, as recently closings of
high-profile bootcamps make clear, this is a rapidly
changing market with many mostly small providers,
a handful of medium-size providers, and one large,
dominant provider. This dynamic is important to
consider as these institutions continue to compete for
market share.
Although this research establishes definitive answers
to some of the most basic questions regarding
bootcamps, research in this area is only just
beginning. This foundational work has raised many
more questions than it has answered; in today’s
climate, perhaps the most pressing question centers
around access. Our data raise questions regarding
whether the programs designed for individuals
looking to receive the necessary training to enter
a lucrative, high-demand career field by way of a
comprehensive career preparation program are truly
open to all.
Unlike traditionally open-access MOOCs and
microcredentials, 59 percent of comprehensive
career preparation programs have competitive
admissions requirements that include logic or
coding tests, interviews, and/or assessments of “fit”;
requirements more stringent and less transparent
than many colleges and universities. Meanwhile,
very little information is available on admission
rates. The extent to which bootcamp programs are
facilitating the entrance of individuals reflecting new
segments of the demographic spectrum into the tech
labor force, in accordance with popular perception,
deserves additional attention; with entrance
requirements that rival or surpass traditional higher
education’s, bootcamps’ impact on the supply side and
implications for reducing gender, racial, and wealth
gaps is unclear but worthy of future study.

https://doi.org/10.3768/rtipress.2018.rr.0033.1902

RTI Press: Research Report

However, admissions are only one barrier to
entry. Most (85 percent) of comprehensive career
replacement programs are offered in person only.
While in-person programs may be a key pedagogical
characteristic of comprehensive career preparation
programs, they limit access for many students who
cannot move for their education. We found that
50 percent of US comprehensive career preparation
programs are located in just 10 CBSAs. These same
CBSAs account for just 29 percent of computer
and mathematical jobs in the United States,
suggesting that many students who could benefit
from technology-related workforce training do not
have access to a comprehensive career preparation
program. A study of Georgia Tech’s online computer
science master’s program suggested that program
location could be a significant barrier; Goodman,
Melkers, and Pallais (2017) found that the increased
flexibility of an online program for mid-career
students was key to their enrollment in any additional
education.
Lastly, prices for comprehensive career preparation
programs are significant. Median tuition for a fulltime comprehensive career preparation program is
$13,500; roughly equivalent to three semesters of
undergraduate study or one year (two semesters) of
graduate study at a public, in-state university at which
students are eligible for federal, state, and institutional
loan and grant aid. Although financial aid from
colleges or bootcamps may make covering these costs
feasible for students, the extent to which financial
aid is available for bootcamp students is unclear and,
because the lenders in this market are private entities,
so are the terms and availability of the educational
loans for this sector.

Technology-Related “Bootcamps”

21

The stringent admissions requirements at many
comprehensive career preparation programs, the
in-person pedagogical model, the geographic
concentrations of these programs, and the cost—
which, on average, exceeds the cost of one year
of graduate school at a public institution—may
deter many potential students with fewer financial
resources. This evidence, combined with Eggleston’s
(2016b) finding that 76 percent of bootcamp
graduates have at least a bachelor’s degree, may
indicate that rather than providing a shortcut to a
high-paying career for students who cannot afford
the time or cost of a traditional 4-year institution,
comprehensive career preparation programs are
simply providing vocational training to wellresourced students who have already demonstrated
their academic proficiency by earning a bachelor’s
degree.
In sum, bootcamps and the programs they offer vary
widely in format and content but may serve a much
narrower group of students than public discourse
would indicate. Our research lays the groundwork
for better understanding the industry and should
serve as a springboard for further study tackling
questions regarding the industry and its students.
Future research should seek to learn more about cost
and financial aid, program offerings, and student
outcomes from a representative set of institutions.
To better understand this rapidly-changing and
alternative educational option, future research
should learn from bootcamp students about access
by demographic characteristics, completion rates,
and post-completion outcomes including debt and
employment.
