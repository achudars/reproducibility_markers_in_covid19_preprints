Abstract. (1) What are the conditions under which post-conflict elections take place and (2) why
do only few post-conflict elections result in democratic post-conflict orders? This is the main puzzle
raised in this paper. The argument is that the decision to stage elections and democratize is highly
strategic and depends on the ethnic size of the post-conflict government leader. Especially postconflict leaders with large ethnic support are able to utilize quick post-conflict elections to stabilize
and legitimize their political position. However, in the long run the government leaders prefer
institutions that maximize their time in office and therefore will hinder full scale democratization.
The empirical analysis demonstrates that the timing of elections and democratization depend on
the ethnic support of the new government and the civil war outcome.

1. Introduction
What are the conditions under which post-conflict elections and democratization take place?
The notion that democratization can occur after armed conflicts seems paradoxical (Wantchekon,
2004). As Wantchekon (2004) highlights many political theorists not only predict but also recommend autocratic institutions after civil wars. Having experienced the English civil wars, Hobbes
(1991) advocates a strong Leviathan to restore a peaceful order. Schumpeter (1976) suggests that
his minimalist conception of democracy would only emerge in the existence of political tolerance
and a strong state and Huntington (1968) even argues that any form of liberal democracy is simply
unattainable in the absence of political order. This theoretical conception might also be the reason
why only recently studies have empirically examined the conditions under which post-conflict democratization takes place in more detail (Gurses and David, 2008; Joshi, 2010; Fortna and Huang,
2012; Joshi, 2013; Colaresi, 2014; Durant and Weintraub, 2014; Hartzell and Hoddie, 2015; Armey
and McNab, 2015; Huang, 2016; Dresden, 2017).
While much research is dedicated to the investigation of democratic transitions from autocratic
order (Lipset, 1959; O’Donnell and Schmitter, 1986; Olson, 1993; Przeworski et al., 2000), fewer

authors focus on post-conflict democratization. This lack of research is surprising as more recent
democratic transition theories consider the non-elites’ threat of rebellion as a necessary condition for
democratization. For example, in the frameworks of Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) or Boix (2003)
rebellion is the consequence of the government’s failure to react appropriately to the demands of
the non-elites. From this perspective, armed conflict is inherently linked to the democratization
struggle of the non-elites and post-conflict democratization should be the natural outcome of nonelite threats.
However, when looking at the empirical data new puzzles arise. The first puzzle is that while
Gurses and David (2008) demonstrate that the level of democracy1 increases after armed conflicts,
this rarely leads to fully democratic institutions (Polity score ≥ 6). Most post-conflict countries
become and stay “anocracies”, that is countries with a Polity score between -5 and +5.2 This
means we observe many competitive autocracies (Levitsky and Way, 2010) which allow for some
political competition but fail to implement full democratic institutional reforms. Figure 1 illustrates
this finding. The upper panel in Figure 1 shows the percentage of countries holding post-conflict
elections. Three years after the armed conflict about 40 percent of the countries held elections and
after five years about 50 percent. After six years about 60 percent of the post-conflict countries cast
their ballot in national elections after which the rate of further post-conflict elections decreases. This
suggests a fairly positive picture of post-conflict democratization as 2/3 of post-conflict countries
actually implement elections.
But when looking at the time between the first post-conflict election and the time these countries
turn democratic (Polity score ≥ 6), the initial positive impression becomes overshadowed. The
lower panel in Figure 1 shows the time between the first post-conflict elections and when a country
turns democratic. At the beginning there is a sharp drop representing democratic countries that
experienced an armed conflict and stayed democratic afterwards (e.g. United Kingdom, India, or
Indonesia). Besides these already pre-conflict democracies not many other countries actually turn
democratic after an armed conflict. Figure 1 demonstrates that only 50 percent of the countries that
hold post-conflict elections eventually turn democratic in the observed time period (1965-2005).
This empirical puzzle motivates two interrelated research questions. (1) What are the conditions
under which post-conflict elections take place and (2) why do only few post-conflict elections result

in democratic post-conflict orders? This paper argues that this pattern results from the postconflict government leader’s preferences over post-conflict institutions. Especially, post-conflict
government leaders with large ethnic support are able to utilize quick post-conflict elections to
stabilize and legitimize their political position. However, in the long run the post-conflict leaders
prefer institutions that maximize their time in office (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003) and therefore
will hinder full scale democratization. Therefore, post-conflict government leaders with large ethnic
support can leverage their popular backing to secure their short-term political survival but hesitate
to implement institutions that endanger their long-term survival in office. Hence, the paper claims
that the discrepancy between election timing and democratization stems from the fact that new
government leaders with large ethnic support can use elections to legitimize and consolidate their
power (Horowitz, 1993). They will favor quick elections to gain domestic and international reputation and support. However, in the longrun they wish to avoid democratization as this yields a
higher risk of leadership turnover (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). New leaders with little ethnic
support would altogether like to avoid elections and longrun democratization. Even though large
scale fraud might gain them the necessary majority, this would not be a credible outcome, thus
failing to enhance their legitimacy in office.
The reason to call for quick post-conflict elections can be seen as a response to the to highly
unstable post-conflict environment. The warring parties have not fully demobilized and splinter
3

groups are likely to challenge the new government. Under these circumstances it is crucial to secure
the short-run political survival but also build the foundation for a long tenure. Hence, I argue that
the end of a civil war is a great opportunity for post-conflict government leaders to engage in what
Riker (1986) called ”heresthetic” behavior. More precisely, in line with Riker’s ideas, post-conflict
leaders will seek to influence the set of relevant agents in a political system, invent new actions,
alter actor preferences, and invent political processes.
In this paper, I extend work that has begun to explore the relationship between civil war outcome
and post-conflict democratization (Gurses and David, 2008; Joshi, 2010; Fortna and Huang, 2012;
Joshi, 2013; Colaresi, 2014; Durant and Weintraub, 2014; Hartzell and Hoddie, 2015; Armey and
McNab, 2015; Huang, 2016; Dresden, 2017). The empirical analysis demonstrates that the timing
of elections depends on the ethnic support of the new government, whereas full democratic reforms
not only depend on the ethnic support of the new leader but also on the outcome of the civil
war. Rebel leaders with large ethnic support are not only more likely to stage elections but also to
implement democratic institutions.
This paper is organized as follows. I shortly review the democratization literature and highlight
the link between post-war democratization and armed conflict. In the theoretical section I present
an argument that explains the strategic choice of post-war institutions as a result of the interaction
between the new government leader and his/her supporters. The presentation of the empirical
results are followed by a concluding section discussing insights and limitations of this study as well
as possible extensions.
2. Literature review
2.1. Democratization. This paper draws from two important political science literatures: the
democratic transition and the civil war research. The democratization literature entails two broad
approaches. One line of research investigates the impact of “good institutions” on economic development and how institutional constraints impact on investment decisions (e.g., Knack and Keefer
(1995); Besley (1995); Barro (1997)). This line of research treats existing institutions as fixed and
investigates equilibria behavior within them.
In contrast, the other research approach tries to endogenize institutions and understands them
as equilibrium outcomes of economic development and inequality (Lipset, 1959; Przeworski, 1991;
Greif and Laitin, 2004; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). This literature argues that democratization
is an equilibrium outcome of the strategic interaction between rich rulers and poor ruled (Geddes,
4

2007). In this context, Boix (2003) develops a theoretical argument that income equality and
capital mobility reduce elite fears of democracy because it decreases their expected costs of political
transition. Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) model democratization as an opportunity for the rich
political elite to mitigate commitment problems in times of weakness. However, one limitation of
these approaches stressing the elite-poor interaction is that democratization is a strictly bottomup process (Houle, 2009). An alternative perspective analyzes democratization as an equilbrium
outcome of political competition and includes a horizontal dimension (Przeworski, 1991, 2005).
Przeworski (1991) argues that democratic systems can only be sustained if the value of electoral
competition is greater than the expected value of a dictatorship. This implies that democracy can
only prosper if electoral defeated actors have reasonable prospects to regain power in the future. In
a slight revision of this argument, Przeworski (2005) suggests that in poor countries such prospects
are neither sufficient nor necessary conditions for democracy, since even groups that have a good
chance of winning in a democracy may want to monopolize power. Moreover, Bueno de Mesquita
et al. (2003) suggest that the political leadership should never have an interest in democratization
because it decreases their prospects of staying in office. Increasing the size of the selectorate and
decreasing the winning coalition at the same time is generally seen as a way to prolong political
survival. Therefore, only constraints by supporters or political competition from challengers might
pressure the leadership into democratic institutions. Hence, democratic institutions cannot solely
be explained by the preferences of the political leadership but by analyzing the interaction between
the elites, non-elites (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006), and possible challengers (Przeworski, 2005).

2.2. Civil War and Democratization. The relationship between civil war and democratization
has mainly been investigated by conceptualizing democratization as an explanatory variable and
analyzing its effect on civil war. This research has generated important insights about the relationship of democratization and civil war onset (Hegre et al., 2001; Reynal-Querol, 2005; Gleditsch,
2007). But far less research has treated civil war as an explanatory variable and looked at its
effect on democratization or post-war institutions (Wantchekon, 2004; Gurses and David, 2008).
Nonetheless, what has been intensely investigated are civil war characteristics that explain postconflict peace duration (Walter, 2004; Fortna, 2004; Doyle and Sambanis, 2000). For example,
Doyle and Sambanis (2000) suggest that peace-keeping operations during war help to sustain peace
and foster democracy. In addition, Hartzell and Hoddie (2003) condition peace duration on the
outcome of civil wars arguing that the more extensive power-sharing agreements are incorporated
5

into settlement agreements, the more likely peace endures. Finally, Mukherjee (2006) claims that
power-sharing agreements are more stable after victories of the government.
In regard to post-war democratization, Wantchekon and Nickerson (1999) show how interventions
can lead to higher levels of post-conflict democracy compared to pre-conflict levels. Wantchekon
(2004) theoretically approaches the puzzle why democratic regimes can arise after civil war and
argues that citizens can have an arbitration role at the end of a conflict, which can help elites to
settle for a democratic post-war order. A study that is closely related to this paper is by Gurses
and David (2008) who explain post-war democratization by the outcome of war. They argue that
elites chose democratic institutions as part of peace settlements, because democracy might be a
way to restore order while constraining the ability of the opponent to revert to political violence.
In the following, I argue that while the civil war literature has strongly focused on the interaction
between the leaders of the warring parties, it underestimates the role of the leaders’ supporters.
The insight of the democratic transition literature that political leaders choose institutions based
on the characteristics and preferences of their supporters has not fully been incorporated in existing
civil war theories. Therefore, this paper stresses the importance of supporter characteristics and
the interaction between the political leadership, their followers, and possible challengers.

2.3. Ethnicity, Elections, and Democratization. The theoretical section of this paper will argue that ethnicity is an important characteristic of government and rebel supporters that conditions
their leaderships’ institutional choice. The relationship between ethnicity and democracy is often
viewed as conflictual. For example, Horowitz (1993) argues that ethnic conflict is a major reason
why democratization failed in many African, Asian, East European, and former Soviet Union countries. Furthermore, he argues that even if a coalition of ethnic groups toppled the old authoritarian
regime, the new leader often peals away from the multi-ethnic party that supported him/her as
soon as s/he was in office. The new post-conflict leader frequently tries to establish a new group
of supporters of his/her own ethnic group and excludes members of other ethnic groups. What is
important about this observation is that even though ethnic lines are indeed transcendable, they
nonetheless provide politically significant cleavages in first (Bratton and van de Walle, 1997) and
post-conflict elections (Collier, 2009). Horowitz (1993) also highlights that free and fair elections
can be utilized by large ethnic groups to permanently exclude smaller groups from political power.
This point is also stressed by Sisk (1996:31) who suggests that:
6

...in many divided societies, electoral competition is a contest for ownership of the
state. Minorities, particularly, equate democracy not with freedom or participation
but with the structural dominance of adversarial majority groups. Permanent minorities... have feared the consequences of electoral competitions, especially when
the expected consequence of majority victory is discrimination against them. For
minority groups, losing an election is a matter not simply of losing office but of
losing the means for protecting the survival of the group.

And also Linz and Stepan (1996:29) argue that multinational, multilingual, and multicultural states
have more complex politics and it will eventually be more difficult to agree on the fundamentals
of democracy. Especialy, if multiple ethnicities are salient and conflicts are polarized along ethnic
lines democratization is believed to be difficult if not impossible. This contrast to a certain extent
with findings of Ordeshook and Shvetsova (1994) which demonstrate that proportionality systems
fail to produce multiple parties in ethnically homogenous and not heterogenous societies. Even
though the arguments and findings slightly vary, there is a broad support for the notion that ethnic
cleavages impact on a country’s political institutions (Mozaffar, Scarritt and Galaich, 2003). While
the following argument does not suggest that ethnicity is a stumbling block for democratization
per-se, it outlines more precise conditions under which ethnic support increases or decreases the
probability of post-conflict elections and democratization.
This paper argues that ethnicity is an important factor to explain the institutional choices
post-conflict leaders make. It thereby follows Riker’s notion that politicians want to manipulate
institutions in their favor by influencing the set of actors, inventing actions, altering incentives,
and creating political processes. This incorporates the idea that institutional change results from
deliberate political strategies to transform structural parameters in order to win long-term political
advantage (Thelen and Steinmo, 1992). That politicians seek to change institutions in their favor
is no surprise as we have empirical evidence that electoral systems have a huge impact on who can
enter, win, and lose political contests (Cox, 1997). The strategic role of electoral institutions is well
established in the literature (Taagepera and Shugart, 1989; Lijphart, 1994; Sartori, 1994) and the
work of Cox (1997) clarifies the central logic that: (a) candidates wish to get elected and voters
want to benefit from their vote choice, and (b) the candidates’ and voters’ expectation of winning
or losing are mutually reinforcing.

3. Theory
3.1. Intuition. Post-conflict environments are extremely unstable and post-conflict government
leaders are confronted with the challenge to consolidate their power. The theoretical section of this
paper argues that post-conflict government leaders can utilize elections and democratization to gain
domestic and international legitimacy and thereby strengthen their political position. Winning
post-war elections signals to potential challengers that the new government has popular support.
This increases the expected costs of toppling the new leader because recruitment costs increase
and potential challengers are more likely to be detected. In addition, post-conflict elections send a
signal to the international community that the new government is on the road to democratization,
which attracts international recognition. This again increases the costs of rebellion for potential
challengers because the new government is likely to attain international support in an armed conflict. However, staging elections quickly after the war entails the risk of losing power and clearly
rigged elections may cause domestic unrest and international contempt. For example, Afghanistan’s
president Karsai faced great international pressure after results of the 2010 election were apparently
rigged. This implies that post-conflict elections are only a feasible strategy for government leaders
who enjoy sufficient popular support to win free and fair elections or and for those that only need
to engage in minor manipulations to decide the electoral contest.
While the theoretical section highlights that post-war elections are beneficial to new government
leaders with large ethnic support, it casts doubts to whether this also holds for democratization.
For example, Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) suggest that government leaders should have an
interest in institutions with large selectorates and small winning coalitions to guarantee their long
term political survival. This implies that new leaders should oppose democratic institutions if
possible. Similarly, Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) argue that the political elite will only implement
democratic institutions in times of weakness to avoid a challenge by the poor. They provide evidence
that democratic institutions can serve as a credible commitment device for the political elite. Boix
(2003) also claims that the political elite will only democratize if certain economic conditions are
met (relative equality and capital mobility). I argue that the decision of post-war government
leaders to democratize is a function of their ethnic support and whether they were pre-conflict
incumbents or rebel leaders. Incumbents that are able to defend their office successfully have little
incentives to democratize, as they survived with the support of their existing winning coalition.
However, rebel leaders that successfully gained office have not yet established a winning coalition

8

that will enable them to rule the state. Additionally, their supporters fought against the elite to
change the political system in their favor, which frequently entails the demand for credible economic
redistribution (Boix, 2003) and access to political power (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006).
3.2. Assumptions.
3.2.1. Actors and Preferences. The theoretical section introduces four actors. An incumbent leader
holding office and a challenger to the government. In addition, each political leader has a group of
supporters that supply the necessary forces to compete in an armed conflict. On the incumbent side
the group that organizes the support for the government are the members of the pre-conflict winning
coalition. In a military dictatorship the winning coalition would entail the top-ranking generals,
while in a one-party system it would be comprised of the top party officials. On the challenger
side the supporters are the politically excluded non-elites that seek political representation and
economic redistribution.
In line with the theoretical approach by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), I assume that both the
incumbent and the challenger are most interested in their political survival. This implies that any
post-conflict leader will try to implement institutions that increase their probability of remaining
in office. However, what distinguishes the challenger and the incumbent are the constraints set by
their supporters. Remember that the incumbent’s supporters are part of the political elite, while
the challenger’s supporters are representing the politically and economically excluded non-elites of
a country. Because the incumbent’s supporters are already part of the existing winning coalition,
they prefer the status quo over any political change that could diminish their political power and
the private goods they are receiving from the government. The challenger’s supporters, on the
other hand, strive for credible political representation and a greater redistribution of wealth and
therefore prefer democratic post-war institutions.
3.2.2. Actions and Payoffs. Having defined the actors and their preferences, I now define the actors’
actions within the theoretical framework. I assume that any new government leader, successful
challenger or incumbent, has five choices.
Leaders’ possible actions:
(a) Stage manipulated elections but do not democratize
(b) Stage manipulated elections and push for democratization
(c) Stage free and fair elections but do not democratize
(d) Stage free and fair elections and push for democratization
(e) Neither organize elections nor democratize the country
9

I assume that the payoffs to each of the outcomes depends on the ethnic support of the new
government leader independent of whether it is the incumbent or a successful challenger. Recall that
winning post-war elections signals to potential challengers that the new government has significant
popular support. This increases the expected costs of toppling the new leader because recruitment
costs increase and potential challengers are more likely to be detected. Recruitment costs increase
because the pool of potential recruits becomes smaller as the number of government supporters
increases. In addition, post-war elections send a signal to the international community that the
new government is on the road to democratization, which attracts international recognition. This
again increases the costs of rebellion for potential challengers because the new government is likely
to attain international support in an armed conflict. Therefore, the expected utility of free and fair
elections increases, the more ethnic support the new government leader has.
Because successful elections are a formidable signal to domestic and international audiences, we
would suspect that there are incentives to manipulate this signal by committing election fraud if the
ethnic support is not sufficient to win in free and fair elections. However, there are certain costs to
the detection of election fraud and the risk of detection increases with the scale of the manipulation.
Election fraud can severely damage the international reputation of the new government leader,
which diminishes his/her international backing and makes him/her more vulnerable to domestic
challengers. For example, Afghanistan’s president Karsai is accused of large scale election fraud
that left him in an extremely weak position. If we assume that the risk of detection increases with
the scale of manipulation, we can conclude that new leaders with small ethnic support will refrain
from election fraud and therefore any form of election.
I now turn to the action set of the supporters. The supporters of the new government leader can
strategically react to their leaders’ actions by either sustaining or withdrawing their support.
Supporters’ possible actions:
(a) Supporting their leader’s action
(b) Withdrawing their support and implement their preferred institutions
If the supporters withdraw their support they can implement their preferred institutions, which
comes at the cost of destabilizing their leadership. Because supporters of large ethnic groups
can be relatively certain to win elections anyways, they are less dependent on their leadership to
be successful at the ballot box. But especially small and medium sized ethnic groups are more
dependent on their leadership and might lose essential votes without a clear leadership that can
solve collection action problems among group members. These groups face a tradeoff between
10

removing their leader and risking political defeat or keeping a leader which might not implement
the preferred institutions but who at least provides private goods to the group.
3.3. Strategic outcomes. I now establish the conditions under which new government leaders
choose to stage elections and democratize. The first proposition is that new government leaders
with low ethnic support are highly unlikely to stage elections. I rest this proposition on two
arguments. The first argument is that because government leaders are interested in their political
survival, they are very unlikely to call for free and fair elections when they are likely to lose them.
In cases where the new leader has low ethnic support this is exactly the case. Even though postconflict elections are not always determined by ethnic configuration, there is empirical evidence
that ethnicity is a major component of success in first elections (Bratton and van de Walle, 1997;
Horowitz, 1993). Therefore, new government leaders with low ethnic support should never support
elections. Nonetheless, as outlined above, there are benefits to successful elections because they
increase the expected costs of challenging the new government. So there might be incentives for
the new government to manipulate elections and commit fraud. However, there are also costs
associated the election fraud. If the manipulation is detected, the result is not a very convincing
domestic signal for support and it might even lead to an international delegitimization. Especially,
leaders with low ethnic support have to engage in large scale and hence easier detectable election
fraud. Therefore, with decreasing ethnic support, there are diminishing returns to election fraud.
This means that even if leaders have the option to manipulate post-conflict elections, they will not
do so if their support is very limited. This leads to the proposition that new government leaders
with low ethnic support will always avoid post-war elections.
Proposition 1: Post-conflict leaders with low ethnic support do not stage postconflict elections.
However, in this setup elections can result from two different processes. Either elections are
solely a strategic decision to consolidate power or they are additionally carried out to achieve
democratization in the long run. Propositions 2 and 3 state that because challengers and incumbents
face different constraints from their support base, the strategic outcome over democratization differs
for these types of leaders. The propositions rest on the assumption that government leaders would
generally like to avoid democratic systems as they increase the probability of leadership turnover and
thus diminish the chances of political survival (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). This implies that
independent of whether the new government leader preferred initial post-conflict election or not,
11

s/he will always prefer non-democratic institutions that guarantee longer term periods. Indeed, in
the case the incumbent stays in power s/he will always achieve this goal because his/her supporters
are members of the pre-conflict winning coalition that would like to keep their revenue of private
goods. Therefore, there are no conflicting interests between the incumbent and his supporters in
regard to preferences over post-conflict institutions.
Proposition 2: Successful incumbents avoid democratic post-conflict institutions
independent of their ethnic support.
The supporters of the challenger on the other hand prefer democratic institutions. They have
been excluded from political power and economic redistribution and seek institutions that will
improve their status. If the challenger enters the government, she would like to opt for nondemocratic institutions to secure her political survival. However, in the challenger’s case the new
leader faces supporters that threaten to withdraw their support if democratization does not take
place. The question is whether the supporter’s threat to turn away from their leader is credible.
Let us for a moment assume that the supporters come from the same ethnic groups as the rebel
leader. If the challenger and her supporters come from a large group and the leader decides not to
democratize the threat of withdrawal is credible. The supporters can withdraw their support and
install a new leader that is more likely to push for democratic institutions. But what happens if
the challenger and her supporters come from a small ethnic group? In this case the threat of of
the supporters is not very credible. If the supporters destabilize their leadership and additionally
have low ethnic support, this could help the ousted incumbent to regain power. This would imply
that a non-democratic order becomes very likely and they would again be excluded from economic
and political power. In case they keep their original leader, they would at least gain some benefits
from private goods and avoid outright discrimination. The mechanism is similar to the argument
in Padró i Miquel (2007), who argues that supporters prefer a predatory leader of their own ethnic
group over a leader from another group because they can at least extract some of the private goods.
Thus, supporters of the challenger will only demand election if they are members of a large ethnic
group.
Proposition 3: Successful challengers avoid democratic post-conflict institutions
if their ethnic support is low but choose to democratize if their support is large.
3.4. Hypotheses. The main insight of the theoretical analysis is that the decision to call for
elections and/or democratize depends on the new government leader’s ethnic group size and whether
12

s/he was the incumbent or the challenger during the armed conflict. Post-conflict leaders with low
ethnic support are unlikely to stage any form of elections but as their ethnic support increases
leaders are more likely to call for elections. They can utilize election to quickly consolidate their
power and increase the expected costs of ousting them from office.
Hypothesis 1: The time between the end of a conflict and post-conflict elections
decreases as the ethnic support of the new government leaders increases.
But how does the decision to stage elections translate into the decision to democratize a country?
At this point the theoretical argument suggests to distinguish between challengers and incumbents.
Even though any new government leader prefers non-democratic post-conflict institutions, they
face different constraints by their supporters. The supporters of the incumbents are members of
the pre-conflict winning coalition who are interested in keeping their share of private goods and
therefore would like to avoid democratization. Hence, there are no conflicting preferences in regard
to the post-conflict institutions and the successful incumbent leader is free to choose non-democratic
institutions.
Hypothesis 2: The time between the end of a conflict and post-conflict democratic
increases if the incumbent successfully defends his government position.
In contrast, supporters of the challenger have joined the rebellion to increase their political and
economic access and only democratic institutions will credibly improve the position of the non-elites
(Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). In case the successful challenger
has sufficient ethnic support she accommodates the demands of her supporters and avoids being
toppled from her followers. But if the challenger and her supporters have only limited ethnic support
the supporters’ threat of withdrawing their support is not credible. Implementing democratic
institutions after having removed their leader decreases their chances of winning elections and
increases the return of the former incumbent. While a non-democratic government led by the
challenger at least increases their share of private goods, a return of the old government would
leave them with the pre-conflict status quo.
Hypothesis 3: The time between the end of a conflict and post-conflict democracy
decreases as the ethnic support of the successful challenger increases.

4. Empirical Model
To test the main hypotheses, I estimate a series of Cox semi-parametric proportional hazards
models as the theoretical model does not imply a particular functional form of the underlying
baseline hazard. This leaves the duration dependency unspecified and focuses the empirical analysis
on how the covariates shift the baseline hazard. In addition, I estimate a recursive multiple equation
probit model with an endogenous dummy regressor (bivariate probit) to assess the endogeneity of
the decision to stage election and the decision to implement democratic post-conflict institutions.

4.1. Dependent variables. The empirical section introduces two dependent variables. The first
dependent variable measures the time between the end of a civil conflict and the first post-conflict
election, while the second dependent variable measures the time between the first post-conflict
election and until a country reaches a Polity score ≥6.3The data is based on the UCDP conflict
termination dataset by Kreutz (2010), the election dataset by Regan, Frank and Clark (2009)4, and
the Polity IV data. The sample used in this paper contains 140 conflicts in 77 countries in the period
from 1975-2005. There are no overlapping conflicts in the dataset. If overlapping conflicts exist, I
use the latest end date to measure the time until an election or a Polity Score ≥6 is reached. If a
conflict reoccurs in a country before elections or democratization takes place, the cases are coded
as right-censored. Comparing this approach to other ways of handling the data results in the most
conservative estimates. Hence, the unit of analysis is a country-conflict-day. There are 124185 days
in the analysis. Out of the 140 cases 96 (69%) experience post-war elections but only 49 (35%)
reach a Polity score ≥6. The average time between the end of a conflict and post-conflict elections
is 1029 days (median= 687 days), while the average time between the first post-conflict election
and until a country reaches a Polity score ≥6 is 2007 days (median=965 days).
In the bivariate probit models the outcome variables are simply collapsed to whether postelections (DV 1) take place and/or a country reaches a Polity score ≥6 after the conflict (DV 2).
In all models clustered standard errors account for possible interdependence across the 77 conflict
units.
3Recent studies operationalize democratization as the change in pre- and post-civil war Polity scores (Wantchekon and

Neeman, 2002; Gurses and David, 2008). The approach in this paper differs as I am interested in the implementation
of fully democratic institutions while controlling for the pre-conflict institutions. Additionally, I prefer to analyze
post-conflict elections and democratization in a duration framework as it provides a more flexible approach than
measuring the Polity score after a fixed time period.

Post−Conflict Government Leaders’ Ethnic Group Size

4.2. Explantory variables. The theoretical section pointed to the importance of the post-conflict
government leader’s ethnic support. In this paper I proxy the ethnic support of the government
leader by the size of his/her ethnic group. Data on the post-conflict government leader is taken
from the Archigos (version 2.9) data set, which lists all government leaders since 1875 (Goemans,
Gleditsch and Chiozza, 2009). To proxy the ethnic support of the post-conflict leader, I use information on the leader’s ethnic group provided by Fearon, Kasara and Laitin (2007). Data on the
size of the respective ethnic groups is taken from Fearon 2003. Using the size of the leader’s ethnic
group to proxy his or her ethnic support comes with potential validity problems because we cannot
be certain whether the ethnic group is politically relevant (Posner, 2004; Cederman and Girardin,
2007). However, the measure itself is highly reliable in the sense that the measurement criteria
are fairly objective. Figure 2 plots the distribution of the post-conflict government leaders’ ethnic
group size.
The paper’s argument highlights that the choice of post-war institutions should not only depend
on the new government leader’s ethnic group size but also whether s/he is the former incumbent
or challenger. I therefore differentiate between government and rebel victories to evaluate whether
the incumbent or the challenger gets into office. In addition, I explicitly model the effect of peace
agreements, leaving cease fires and low intensity outcomes as residual outcome in the estimated
15

models. Information on the outcome of civil conflict is taken from Kreutz (2010). Out of the
140 conflict in the sample 32 end in government victories, 13 in rebel victories and 20 in peace
agreements. I leave ceasefires and low-intensity outcomes as the residual category of the analysis.
In order to control for the effects external actors have on election timing and democratization, I
include dummy variables for military interventions by democracies, autocracies, and international
organizations (IOs). Especially IOs mission mandates frequently state the goal of implementing
elections and democratic institutions. Data on international military interventions is taken from
Kisangani and Pickering (2007) and Pearson and Baumann (1992)5. This intervention data has
the advantage of providing start and end dates, as well as differentiating between interventions of
states and organizations. I generate three dummy variables from this data. The dummy variable
IO intervention takes the value 1 if an IO militarily intervenes in a country. Similarly, a dummy
variable democratic intervention is coded as 1 if a democratic state intervenes militarily. A country
is coded as democratic if its Polity Score is ≥7 at the time of the intervention. Finally, the dummy
autocratic intervention takes the value of 1 if a state with a Polity Score <7 intervenes militarily
in a country.
The literature on democratization and economic development alludes to a very strong relationship
between GDP per capita and democratic institutions (e.g., Barro (1997)). Hence, I control for GDP
per capita and population (Gleditsch, 2002) in the empirical model. Additionally, I control for the
number of conflict parties that were active during a conflict. Finally, I control for the pre-conflict
Polity score which should have a positive effect on both election timing and democratization.
5. Results
The first set of results relies on Cox proportional hazard models. The estimation results for
post-conflict election timing can be found in Table 1. Results for the second set of models estimating the time until a country reaches a Polity score ≥6 are presented in Table 3. Model related
summary statistics are provided at the bottom of each table. The coefficients show the impact of
the explanatory variables on the hazard of an event taking place. Thus, positive coefficients imply
that an independent variable increases the risk of election or democratization. The significance of
each estimate is measured by two-tailed tests.
5The operational definition used by Kisangani and Pickering (2007) and Pearson and Baumann (1992) states that:

“Military interventions are defined operationally in this collection as the movement of regular troops of forces (airborne, seaborne, shelling, etc) of one country inside another, in the context of some political issue or dispute”(Pearson
and Baumann, 1992:1).

16

5.1. Cox models: Hazard of post-conflict elections. In Model 1 (Table 1), I estimate a baseline model that excludes any of the theoretically implied interaction effects. Neither the government
leader’s ethnic group size nor any of the civil war outcome variables have a statistically significant
effect on shifting the baseline hazard. However, IO interventions have a strong and positive effect
on the underlying baseline hazard of post-war elections. This finding is very robust and significant
across all models in Table 1. In fact, out of the 14 conflicts with an IO intervention 11 eventually have post-war elections. Another relatively robust and expected finding is that countries
with a high pre-conflict Polity score have earlier post-conflict elections than countries with a low
pre-conflict Polity level.
An important assumption in the Cox model is that the explanatory variables shift the underlying
baseline hazard proportional and that this proportionality is maintained over time. This implies
that the relative hazard for any two combinations of Xβ must be conform with the following
proportional relationship in every time period t (Keele, 2010):
(1)

h0 (t)eXi β eXi β
=
h0 (t)eXj β eXj β

The standard diagnostic to tests for nonproportional hazards analyze the Schoenfeld residuals. The
most common diagnostic was developed by Grambsch and Therneau (1994) and utilizes the scaled
Schoenfeld residuals to establish a global and a covariate specific test diagnostic. I follow Keele
(2010) in the description of the covariate specific test statistic. First, let s∗k be the scaled Schoenfeld
residuals for covariate k. Furthermore, define gk as k’s time scale and ḡ as the average time scale.
The Grambsch and Therneau (1994) test statistic for detecting nonproportionality can then be
written as:
(2)

P
( (gk − ḡ)s∗k )2
P
Tk =
dIk (gk − ḡ)2

where Ik is the information matrix elements for covariate k, and d represents the event times. An
intuitive interpretation of the test is that it measures the correlation between covariate specific
residuals s∗k and event time d. One “problem” of this test statistic is that it not only detects
nonproportionality but also more general issues of model misspecification (Keele, 2010). However,
I will take advantage of this “weakness” of the Grambsch and Therneau (1994) test to conclude
whether a model that includes the hypothesized interaction effects should be preferred over a model
that excludes them. If the non-proportionality test gives us a positive result when the interaction

effects are excluded but a negative result if they are included, we can conclude that the model
without the interaction effect was misspecified. This would give us considerable more certainty
that the interaction model is the preferred one.
The first two columns in Table 2 display the Grambsch and Therneau (1994) nonproportionality
test results for Model 1. Tk refers to the “correlation” between the residuals and event times,
while the p-value pertains to a χ2 test with 1 degree of freedom to whether Tk is significantly
different from 0. Three variables have p-values <.05 indicating a violation of the proportionality
18

assumption6: Rebel victory, peace agreement, and IO intervention. The standard approach would
be to interact these variables with the log of time and include them into the estimated model
(Box-Steffensmeier and Zorn, 2001). However, before using the standard approach, I first enter
the hypothesized interaction effects and test whether Model 2 fairs better in the Grambsch and
Therneau (1994) test.
Model 2 includes the theoretically implied interaction terms. In line with Hypothesis 1 the
interaction effect of the rebel leaders’ ethnic group size and rebel victory is positive and significant.
This implies that victorious rebel leaders with large ethnic support are very likely to call for quick
elections after the a conflict. However, this effect is not significant for successful incumbents and
close to zero after peace agreements. But to see whether the inclusion of the interaction terms
solves some of the problems of meeting the proportionality assumption in Model 1, we turn back to
Table 2. Looking at the p-values for rebel victory and peace agreement, we can see that they now
surpass the suggested critical value of 0.05 (Keele, 2010; Box-Steffensmeier and Zorn, 2001). In
addition, the interaction terms pass this criterion as well. Furthermore, the test results for Model 2
suggest that rebel victory benefits the most from the inclusion of the interaction terms and that the
global test statistic is substantively improved. Therefore, Model 2 provides substantial evidence
that victorious rebel leaders with large ethnic support are more likely to initiate quick elections
by: (1) revealing a positive and significant interaction between the post-war governments’ ethnic
group size and rebel victory and (2) improving the variable specific and global test statistic for
nonproportionality, which suggests that Model 2 is the preferred specification over Model 1 that
excluded the interaction terms.
The only variable that still reveals problems of nonproportionality in Model 2 is IO Intervention.
Having explored the interaction terms between IO interventions and other variables in the model
without improving the results of the Grambsch and Therneau (1994) test, I retreat to the standard
approach of dealing with non-proportionality by including an interacted term with the log of time.
Indeed, Model 3 suggests that in the case of IO interventions “actual” non-proportionality is the
reason for misspecification in Model 1 and 2. First, the interacted term with ln(Time) is significant,
second the variable-specific test statistic greatly improves, and finally the global test for Model 3
also fairs better than for Models 1 and 2. The estimated effects for all other variables in Model 3
are only marginally different from Model 2.
6As with other test statistic the threshold of 0.05 is relatively arbitrary. However, Box-Steffensmeier and Zorn (2001)

and Keele (2010) argue this to be a reasonable cutoff point.

Figure 3 plots the impact of the different conflict outcomes against the government leaders’ ethnic
group size to illustrate the interaction effects in Model 3. The plots reemphasize the described
findings but additionally highlight that victorious rebel leaders are only significantly quicker to
stage elections if their ethnic group consists of more than 50 percent of a country’s population.
This threshold fits very well with the theoretical argument as a majority of 50 percent is very likely
to carry the challenger into office. While the interaction effect for government victories is also
positive it is not significant at any value of the ethnic group size. This last finding is not in line
with the theoretical implications and I return to this point when discussing the bivariate probit
models.

second set of results focuses on the conditions under which post-conflict elections are succeeded by
a democratic transition. As outlined above, I will define a country as democratic if its Polity score

is ≥67. Table 3 presents the Cox regression estimates with the dependent variable measuring the
time between post-conflict elections and democratization. Before turning to the estimates, I want
to reiterate that only in 49 out of 96 cases post-conflict elections lead up to democratization. This
is an astonishing low number and highlights that post-war elections and post-war democratization
are to some extent distinct processes. While post-conflict elections are a necessary condition for
democratization, they are certainly not a sufficient one. In the following, I do not provide the
previous extensive discussion of the proportionality diagnostics but the pattern is similar to the

problem disappears once the interaction term is included. In contrast to Model 1-3, IO interventions
meet the proportionality assumption but non-democratic interventions do not. Therefore, I include
an interaction term of non-democratic interventions and ln(Time) in Models 5 and 6.

Turning to the control variables in Model 5 and 6 reveals that IO interventions are not only a
good predictor for post-conflict elections but also for post-conflict democratization. Similarly and
not surprisingly is the pre-conflict Polity score positively and significantly related to a quick postwar democratization. Different to the previous models, democratic interventions now significantly
increase the “risk” of democratization. In addition, non-democratic interventions also seem to

decrease the time until first post-conflict elections but this effect is offset by the negative effect
they have if conflicts last longer.
When introducing the interaction terms in Model 6, we arrive at similar results as in Models
2-4. Incumbent and rebel victories are associated with post-war democratization if the post-war
government leader comes from large ethnic groups. While this effect is significant for rebel victories,
this is not the case when incumbents successfully defend their office. Figure 4 provides a graphical
interpretation of the interaction effect for rebel victories. Similar to the post-conflict election results,
the effect of the post-war governments’ ethnic group size becomes significant if the ethnic represents
more than 50 percent of the population. This finding is in line with Hypothesis 3 that successful
challengers with large ethnic support are not only likely to call for quick election but also push
for democratization measures. The negative but non-significant interaction between government
victories and the post-war government leaders’ ethnic group size provides support for Hypothesis
2 that successful incumbents are unlikely to implement democratic institutions.
Summarizing the results, I find strong support for the hypotheses that successful rebel leaders
from large ethnic groups use elections and democratization to consolidate their power (Hypothesis 1
and 3). Based on the Cox results, successful incumbents seem not to utilize elections to consolidate
their power but in line with Hypothesis 2 avoid democratization.
23

5.3. Bivariate Probit results. While the results from the Cox models provide important findings that support the main hypotheses of this paper, they do not capture the interdependency
between the decision to stage elections and/or democratize. However, it is theoretically sensitive
to assume that the decision to call for elections will depend on the intention to democratize. But
similarly, the decision to stage elections can also increase the demand for democratization even if
elections were originally suppose to simply consolidate and legitimate one’s power. This implies
that the post-conflict government’s decision to stage elections and/or democratize should explicitly
be modeled as two distinct but dependent processes. However, implementing such an approach in
a duration framework is problematic since interdependent duration models are rare in political science (Hays and Kachi, 2009; Hays, 2009). For example, Quiroz Flores (2008) estimates the tenure
of chief executive officers and the median duration of their ministers as interdependent durations
using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) approach. Darmofal (2009) uses a spatial-error approach to estimate issue position taking on NAFTA in the U.S. Congress. However, a problem
of adapting these estimation approaches it that the mentioned estimators do not allow for rightcensored observations. This would be unproblematic if only a few observation were affected which
could be dropped in the analysis. Yet, especially in the case of post-conflict democratization 2/3
of the cases never experience the event. Therefore, I implement a simpler estimation approach to
address the possible endogeneity between post-conflict elections and democratization. I do so by
estimating a series of seemingly unrelated bivariate probit models which allow for two processes
with dichotomous dependent variables where the error terms are correlated. One way of addressing
the endogeneity of these processes is to include the outcome variable of the second equation on the
right hand side of the first one. More formally this recursive multiple equation biprobit model with
endogenous dummy regressors (EDR) can be expressed as (Maddala, 1983):
(3)

∗
y1i

Therefore, I create two outcome variables which correspond to the failure indicators of the first
two models. Thus, the first dependent variable indicates whether post-conflict elections took place

24

and the second dependent variable measures whether post-conflict democratization was achieved.
Models 7 and 8 provide the results for two separate probit models to establish a baseline against
the bivariate probit models. Overall, the results are in line with the Cox regression results. In
regard to the main explanatory variables the interaction effect of rebel victory and the post-conflict
government leader’s ethnic group size is positive and significant in both models. Similar to the Cox
results, the interaction effect for government victories is positive but not significant. IO intervention
predicts too many post-conflict elections perfectly and is therefore dropped from Model 7, but it
is positively and significantly related to post-war democratization in Model 8. A higher GDP
per capita now increases the probability of post-conflict elections significantly, while democratic
and non-democratic interventions have opposite effects on post-war democratization. As in the
previous models pre-conflict Polity scores are a good predictor for both post-conflict elections and
democratization. While these results are only an intermediate step, they additionally provide
evidence that the findings of the Cox models are robust to alternative estimation strategies.
Turning to the bivariate probit estimates in Table 4, Model 9 provides a SUR estimation but
without modeling the endogeneity between post-conflict elections and democratization. The results
are extremely consistent with the two probit models but the significant ρ parameter indicates that
the error terms of the two equations are highly correlated. Model 10 accounts for the endogeneity
of these processes by including the post-conflict democratization dummy into the post-conflict
election equation. One should note that in contrast to linear simultaneous equations with only
continuous endogenous variables, the recursive multiple equation probit model with endogenous
dummy regressors does not need an exclusion restriction for the exogenous variables (Wilde, 2000).
Reason for concern however is that the ρ parameter in Model 10 approximates -1, which could
imply problems of convergence and hence biased estimates. Therefore, I restricted the model at
ρ=-0.25;-0.5;-0.75 to see whether the estimated results greatly differ. However, Model 10 with ρ=0.99 results in comparatively conservative estimates and I present those results. When assessing the
goodness of fit we can see that the EDR model is much better at correctly predicting post-conflict
elections. Figure 5 compares how well Models 7, 9, and 10 can distinguish between cases that do
and do not hold post-conflict elections. While the SUR (Model 9) does slightly better than the
standard probit model (Model 7), the EDR (Model 10) is not unexpectedly the best fitting model.
In regard to the prediction of democratic post-conflict orders all models (Model 8-10) perform very

well. Figure 6 demonstrates that the EDR model does slightly better than the other two models,
but the difference is not substantial.
The results of the Cox models suggested that the model fit improved when including the interaction effects. The same pattern arises when looking at the bottom of Figures 5 and 6. The bottom
panels show the predicted probabilities for all models excluding the interaction terms8. Comparing
the top and bottom plots, it becomes obvious that the inclusion of interaction terms improves
the model-fit especially for the prediction of post-conflict democratization (Figure 6). However, it
also shows that for post-conflict elections the EDR model vastly improves in model it when the
interaction terms are included (Figure 5).

Turning to the estimates of the control variables in the EDR model (Model 10), slight changes
to the SUR model (Model 9) can be observed. While GDP per capita, population size, democratic
interventions, and IO intervention provide similar results, I shortly highlight some changes in the
other control variables. The positive effect of non-democratic interventions on the probability of
post-conflict elections is now significant and the pre-conflict Polity score estimate is now slightly
negative and significant. The negative impact of the pre-conflict Polity score results from the fact
that the second equation already accounts for the strong positive effect of the pre-conflict score. The
remaining negative covariation results from pre-conflict democracies that do not stay democratic
after the conflict and do not have any post-conflict elections.
In line with the theoretical considerations, Model 10 confirms that the decision to democratize
highly impacts on the decision to stage elections. In contrast to the previous models, the government
victory interaction term slightly increases and becomes significant in the post-election equation. To
see why the interaction term becomes significant consider Figure 7. The panels in Figure 7 display
the predicted probabilities for post-conflict elections plotted against the post-conflict government
leader’s ethnic group size if the incumbent government stays in power. The connected red crosses
are the actual post-conflict elections while the connected blue circles are the observation that do
not experience any post-conflict elections. In the optimal case all red crosses would be at the top
of the plot and blue circles would be at the bottom. This would imply that the model performs
very good at differentiating post-conflict elections from cases without elections across all values
of the government leader’s ethnic group size. The left panel shows the predicted probabilities for
Model 7. The simple probit model does a very good job at predicting post-conflict elections if the
post-conflict government leader comes from a large ethnic group and the incumbent stays in power.
However at lower levels of the government leaders ethnic group size Model 7 is not very good at
differentiating between positive and negative cases. Cases without post-conflict elections have a
quite high predicted probability and overlap with positive cases. This leads to a very high falsepositive rate in Model 7 if the incumbent succeeds. When considering the “standard” cutoff point
of 0.5, the false-positive rate is 100 percent (6 of 6). Using a more appropriate model related cutoff
point by using the mean predicted probability, the false-positive rate is still at 50 percent. The
same pattern arises when looking at the SUR (Model 9) plot in the middle of Figure 7. However,
when looking at the very left EDR panel (Model 10) a different picture emerges. This model is
much better at differentiating positive (red) from negative (blue) cases. First using the “standard”

29

threshold of .5, the false-positive rate drops from 100 to 50 percent (3 of 6). Using the model’s mean
predicted probability as a cutoff point, leaves the false-positive at 33 percent (2 of 6). It is true
that this improvement in the false-positive rate comes at the cost of a slightly worse false-negative
rate. With the “standard” threshold the false-negative rate increases to 11.5 percent (Probit: 3.8%;
SUR: 3.8%). Using the model related threshold, the false-negative rate increases to 30.8 percent
(Probit: 15.4%; SUR: 19.2%). This implies that the significant interaction effect is attributable to
the EDR model’s improvement in the false-positive rate even though this comes at the cost of a
fairly worse false-negative rate.
The general findings of the EDR model are in line with Hypothesis 1 which suggested that both
successful incumbents and challengers from large ethnic groups have incentives to stage post-conflict
elections and thereby consolidate their power. This implies that once we account for the endogeneity
of post-conflict elections and democratization, we find support for for Hypothesis 1. Another
important finding is that the interaction effects of rebel victories and the post-conflict leader’s
ethnic group size is slightly smaller in Model 10. This suggests that we slightly overestimated this
effect in the previous models. The results in the democratization equation are consistent with the
previous models even though the rebel victory interaction effect is also slightly smaller.
6. Conclusion
This paper is motivated by the fact that many countries experience elections after an armed
conflict even though this is rarely succeeded by the implementation of fully democratic institutions.
The paper provided theoretical arguments and statistical evidence that the post-conflict government
leader’s ethnic group size is an important factor in explaining election timing and democratization
after an armed conflict. Victorious challengers and incumbents that belong to large ethnic groups
are more likely to stage quick elections after an armed conflict. These post-conflict leaders can
utilize elections to gain domestic reputation and international support which stabilizes their political
position. The Cox model estimates showed that this finding primarily pertains to victorious rebel
leaders. However, once I modeled the endogeneity of the decision to call for elections and the
decision to implement democratic institutions, also victorious incumbents from large ethnic groups
are more likely to utilize elections.
The paper also pointed out that only half of the post-conflict elections are actually succeeded
by democratization. The theoretical section highlighted that post-conflict leaders should generally
hinder democratization because democratic institutions increase the risk of government turnover.

However, I argued that successful incumbents and challengers face different constraints by their
supporters when deciding over post-conflict institutions. The supporters of the former rebel leader
are more likely to belong the the politically and economically excluded non-elites. The non-elites
prefer democratic institutions because they guarantee more restributional government policies. If
the challenger’s supporters additionally belong to a large ethnic group they will pressure their
leader to install democratic institutions. Indeed, I can show across all model that post-conflict
democratization becomes more likely if the the rebels win and the new leader belongs to a large
ethnic group.
31

Overall, the empirical results support the implications of the theoretical model. Nonetheless there
are important limitations of this study. Most importantly, it would be preferable to estimate the
endogeneity of election timing and democratization in a duration-duration framework. In this study,
I retreated to a recursive multiple equation probit model with endogenous dummy regressors (EDR)
because the data includes a large number of right-censored observations. Further research would
be necessary to implement a duration-duration model that allows for right-censoring. Another
limitation of this study is that it very much focuses on rebel or government victories. Further
research could explore the institutional setup after peace agreements by identifying the ethnic
group size of all political leaders at the bargaining table. For example, one could then analyze
whether post-conflict institutions depends on the political leader with the smallest ethnic groups
size who may veto any democratization efforts.
In sum, this paper demonstrates that post-conflict government leaders condition their postconflict institutional choices on the size of their ethnic group. This finding is especially pronounced
fore victorious rebel leaders that take over government office. The finding support the idea that
political leaders from large ethnic groups can utilize their support to marginalize political opponents. The paper also highlights that it is important to open up the black box of political leaders’
characteristics to explain post-conflict dynamics. Therefore, this paper contributes to the growing
literature that stresses that organizational (Humphreys and Weinstein, 2006), power-related (Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009), and geographic attributes (Cederman, Buhaug and Rød,
2009; Weidmann, 2009) of political organizations matter when explaining conflict dynamics.
