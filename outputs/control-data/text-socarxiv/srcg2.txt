Electoral Systems, Competition, and Incentives
for Corruption∗
Umberto G. Mignozzetti†

Abstract
What is the effect of electoral rules on political corruption? While the influence of
electoral systems on accountability and representation has been widely studied, the link
between electoral systems and corruption remains sparse. This paper develops a model
for the interplay between corruption and electoral rules, considering the incentives for
challengers to expose the corruption undertaken by the incumbents. I identify two major
components: first, rules that increase competition create incentives for freeriding, as
challengers would prefer that other challengers pay the cost of exposure. Second, larger
district sizes create coordination problems, as the same incumbent may be overexposed,
while others were not exposed at all. These characteristics make a mix of high competitiveness and PR the worst system regarding incentives for corruption. I show that these
predictions hold empirically using quasi-experimental data from Brazilian municipalities.
This study has implications for the design of electoral institutions.

Introduction

The design of electoral institutions is key for political accountability and representation (Cox 1997; Manin et al. 1999; Carey and Hix 2011; Shugart and Taagepera 2017;
Taylor et al. 2017). Electoral rules influence incentives that politicians face when
they are in office, public service provision, reelection and survival in office, campaign
strategies, and incumbency advantages, among other characteristics. One particular

consequence of electoral rules is their effect on corruption (Persson et al. 2003; Kunicova and Rose-Ackerman 2005; Chang and Golden 2007; Charron 2011; Alfano et al.
2014; Schleiter and Voznaya 2014; Xezonakis et al. 2015; Schwindt-Bayer and Tavits
2016).
Despite the large body of literature on incentives that electoral systems create for
corruption, two problems persist. On the one hand, the roles of challengers in coping
or boosting corruption remain unclear. Challengers are not the politicians that embezzle money, but their campaign strategies are essential, not only communicate with
voters about her platform but also to hold the incumbent’s accountable, by exposing
their malfeasances once in office.1
On the other hand, despite the richness of the empirical literature on electoral systems and corruption, it frequently finds mixed results regarding the impact of district
size, the pool of competitors, parties, and other electoral characteristics on corruption.
For instance, Persson et al. (2003) show that closed-list Proportional Representation
(PR) increases corruption by making voters less capable of punishing politicians, and
single-member districts (SMD) may not be best for corruption as it poses significant
entry barriers to honest politicians. However, Chang and Golden (2007) demonstrate
that, when controlling for the district magnitude, open-list PR performs worse in largemagnitude districts compared with closed-list PR (and vice-versa for small magnitude
districts), showing that the results are highly non-monotone. Also, while Charron
(2011) shows that more competition increases corruption, specially in single-member
district countries, Schleiter and Voznaya (2014) and Schleiter and Voznaya (2016) argue
that party competition and party institutionalization increase the availability of credible alternatives against corrupt politicians, decreasing corruption. Moreover, Tavits
(2007); Potter and Tavits (2011) and Schwindt-Bayer and Tavits (2016) show that clarity
of responsibility is essential for corruption outcomes, as it limits the capacity for politicians to hide behind the political system, making them more accountable for bad out1

According to Polborn and David (2006), negative campaign is useful as it reveals information about
candidates that they would now be willing to reveal by themselves. This paper rationalizes the idea
that negative campaign, such as exposing a corrupt past, maybe even desirable from the perspective of
voter’s welfare.

comes.2 Therefore, findings on the corruption-electoral systems literature are mostly
contradictory, and this claims for a stronger theoretical foundation that conciliates differences in empirical models and their institutional and behavioral incentives.
This paper provides a rigorous micro-foundation for one facet of the corruptionelectoral system nexus. I build a model on corruption incentives considering the two
main set of players in this strategic interaction: incumbents and challengers. Incumbents choose policy investments, with the possibility to add kickbacks to the optimal
required values. Challengers observe the total investment and choose a proportion of
their campaign to devote for exposing the incumbents’ corruption. Solving the model
presents the determinants for the corruption levels: the free-riding incentives caused
by the number of competitors, and the coordination failures caused by the number of
incumbents.3
Polities with an open entry may attract many challengers, and even though challengers benefit from the use of negative campaign, they prefer to let the other challengers expose the corrupt politician: free-riders avoid the costs of exposing the corrupt politicians while benefiting from the increased winning chances. Additionally,
polities with many incumbents, such as proportional representation systems, add coordination failures to the top of the free-riding incentives: when there are many challengers and incumbents, challengers may happen to expose the same politician, leaving other incumbents without proper denouncing.4 This possibility makes incumbents
more prone to pocket even more money than when there is only free-riding caused by
a large pool of challengers. In sum, these collective action problems determine the
incentives that challengers have to expose incumbents, therefore impacting the incentives for corruption.
2

For a summary of the clarity of responsibility and elections see Silva and Whitten (2017).
Free-riding here means that politicians benefit from letting others pay the price of exposing a corrupt politician, and coordination problems refer to the fact that, for example with two incumbents,
challengers may concentrate their efforts on one politician, leaving the other unexposed.
4
Although a system that has many incumbents is not a perfect representation of PR systems, a perfect
PR representation would make the model considerably harder to understand, without changing the
qualitative characteristic of its results. Moreover, our approach is similar to Myerson (1993), with the
key difference that we do not assume the existence of a behaviorally non-corrupt politician. In this
sense, this is a moral hazard model, while Myerson’s is an adverse selection model.

The results here suggest that the least corrupt system is the single-member district
with restrictions for contest office and the most corrupt system is proportional representation with weak parties and personalistic voting (open-lists). However, as changes
in electoral systems reflect more profound trade-offs, sometimes polities may decide
that multi-member districts trumps single-member districts, as their primary objective
is to accommodate social cleavages or improve the representation of minorities.5 The
historical development of each polity determines these trade-offs and the relative importance of representation, accountability, corruption, and other related components.
My argument in this paper is that if corruption is a problem that the polity wants to
fight, and if politicians want to limit corruption by reforming the electoral system, then
they should raise entry barriers and decrease district size. Additionally, I discuss many
extensions that shed light on the micro-level electoral institutions affecting the collective action problems. Rules such as run-offs, proportional representation thresholds,
or even laws that bar convicted politicians to contest offices are sometimes proposed as
a method to lower corruption. Again, institutions that lower competition and district
size increase incentives for challengers to expose corrupt politicians, lowering political
corruption.
The last session of the paper shows that our claims hold empirically, by exploiting two quasi-experimental shocks in district size and competition in Brazil. First, I
show that run-off and candidacy impact on corruption. Second, I show that exogenous thresholds for legislature size influences candidacy and district size, impact on
corruption. This paper builds upon Ferraz and Finan (2011), Avis et al. (2016), and
Britto and Fiorin (2016) findings, providing a theoretical explanation for their results.
These results provide a solid empirical test for my model, showing that the electoral
rules and competitiveness consistently affect corruption levels, in one of the most corrupt democracies in the world.
I organize the paper as follows. Section 2 discusses the foundations for the inter5

representation and accountability, where PR in small districts seem to be the best for maximizing representation without lowering accountability considerably.

it for a variety of challenger pools and district sizes, and discusses extensions to the
primary model, exploring the variations found in the empirical literature. Section 4
empirically test our predictions using the Brazilian municipal audit data. Section 5
concludes the paper, presenting a few policy implications and trade-offs derived from
the results advanced here.6

Corruption, politics, and institutions

In modern societies, elections select representatives, that carry out the interests of voters (Pitkin 1967; Manin 1997). Representation creates a principal-agent problem as
the elected have the latitude to implement or not the voters’ preferences (Manin et al.
1999). As there exist many methods and rules to elect politicians, these rules affect
the extent through which politicians perceive themselves as accountable to voters in
several forms (Lizzeri and Persico 2001; Grofman 2016).
For instance, consider the differences in representation generated by multi-member
and single-member districts. In single-member districts, only one representative gets
elected, and she represents the district majority. In homogeneous districts, singlemember districts with majoritarian rule capture the social and racial composition precisely. However, when there is considerable heterogeneity, such as social, racial, or
religious cleavages, single-member districts may under-represent those cleavages. In
these cases, multi-member districts are preferable concerning representation, as they
tend to reflect the actual proportions of these cleavages more closely.
However, electoral institutions embed more profound trade-offs in every dimension they affect (Grofman and Lijphart 1986; Carey and Hix 2011; Grofman 2016).
Multi-member districts favor representation but also translate into a more significant
number of parties, increasing the governing costs (Duverger 1959; Fujiwara et al. 2011).
Single-member districts, on the other hand, tend to produce fewer represented parties,

The paper also has an online companion that solves more thoroughly the theoretical models, and
access the robustness of the empirical models, studying a variety of alternative specifications.

lowering the governing costs.
One dimension affected by the electoral rules is the electoral campaigns. Every
politician divides their campaign roughly in two basic strategies: positive campaign,
where they present their political platform for voters; and negative campaign, where
they campaign against their opponents, aiming to affect the voter’s perceptions regarding other candidates (Harrington Jr and Hess 1996; Polborn and David 2006; Walter et al. 2014). Although voters and politicians may perceive positive campaign as
less controversial, negative campaigns are also essential, primarily when they aim to
expose a corrupt politician (Polborn and David 2006; Ferraz and Finan 2008; Avis et al.
2016). In this sense, to understand how electoral systems affect corruption, we need
to explore the effects of electoral rules on incentives for challengers to expose corrupt
incumbents.
Exposing corrupt politicians consumes campaign resources, and the aim is to
change the voters’ perspectives about another politician. However, the electoral rules
affect the number of politicians, either incumbent or challengers, running in the election. In this sense, like any other situation where there are many politicians, collective
action problems affect the willingness to campaign against a corrupt incumbent (Olson 2009; Ostrom 2015). These collective action problems will determine the incentives
that challengers face when they are willing to expose corrupt incumbent(s).
For this paper, two types of collective action problems matter when studying electoral rules: free-riding and coordination failures. First, electoral rules influence the
incentives that candidates have to free ride on others candidates’ negative campaigns.
The free-riding here entails a situation where a candidate does not pay the costs of
negative campaigning but benefit from the negative campaigning undertaken by the
other candidates.
Second, electoral institutions may cause coordination failures, as candidates would
be better-off exposing only one incumbent at a time, but as they cannot perfectly coordinate, they end up targeting the same incumbent more than one time. If we consider
that the likelihood of exposure has decreasing returns, meaning that the more negative

6

campaigning politicians make, the lower the effects of additional negative campaigning, inefficient targeting lowers the effectiveness of corruption exposures. A summary
of these two effects on different electoral rules follows in Table 1.

Regarding corruption incentives, single-member districts with one challenger running are the least corrupt systems. The reason here is that any negative campaign
that harms the incumbent also increases the challenger’s electoral perspective. In this
sense, no free-riding or coordination failures happen, and the incentives to expose
corrupt politicians are at the maximum. This explains why majoritarian systems with
run-off are effective in lowering corruption: the run-off makes the election to polarize,
eliminating the free-riding and coordination failures (Ferraz and Finan 2011).
Adding more challengers create a free-riding problem, as challengers may benefit
when other fellow challengers investigate the incumbent. This result points to the
direction that more competition increases corruption, agreeing with the majority of
the empirical findings (Charron 2011).7
Adding more seats and more challengers further reduce the incentives to expose
corrupt politicians, and the reason is twofold. First, adding more seats create freeriding incentives, as it increases the absolute number of competitors, even when the
ratio of competitors-per-seat is kept constant. Second, adding more seats increase the
7

A few papers, such as Persson et al. (2003), argue that competition is positive, as it presents lower
entry barriers, and therefore, credible alternatives against corrupt politicians. Despite their findings,
most of the literature shows a negative influence of competition. However, at the party level, competition seems to provide positive results (Schleiter and Voznaya 2014).

likelihood of coordination failure, as the same incumbent may be exposed more than
once while others may be not exposed at all. These two effects lower the incentives for
exposing corrupt politicians, and they reasonably explain why countries with openlist proportional representation systems are endemic corrupt (Myerson 1993; Ames
1995; Mello and Spektor 2018).
However, the cases reported above may be considered pure forms, that vary with
the particular characteristics of each system. Consider, for instance, three variants of
these simple electoral rules. First, consider that party lists may be open or closed, and
this affects the strength of a party. Closed lists empower party leaders, and may have
a positive effect on coordination, lowering corruption. Chang and Golden (2007) find
that there exists a threshold where closed-list proportional representation systems become less corrupt than open-list proportional representation systems. Schleiter and
Voznaya (2016), along with similar lines, argue that stronger parties are better to decrease political corruption.
This list can be extended, as there are many types of political rules. Ultimately,
they will be closer to one of the forms in Table 1. The main conclusion is that larger
the number of incumbents or number of challengers, the more the collective action
problem in the exposure of corrupt politicians.8

A model on how incentives and institutions affect political corruption?

Let a strategic interaction between three players: an incumbent politician (I), a challenger politician (C), and a representative voter (V ).
The incumbent I has a fixed budget of A units, to invest in service provision. The
level of expenditure required to provide the public goods is a random variable η ∈
8

Moreover, the mechanism in play may not be the same as the exposed here, and the diminished
incidence of corruption could be caused not because challengers investigate more, but because of some
other feature. Here in this paper, I abstract from these other possibilities in order to explore the role of
challengers in the diverse electoral systems.

8

[0, A], where f (η) an increasing probability density function. The randomness reflects
the idea that changes in real-world conditions influence the amount needed for service
provision. The incumbent knows the optimal investment level, making it her private
information. If incumbents were honest, they would invest the needed amount to
provide the services (η), but in this model, the incumbent invests the optimal amount
plus some value, that she intends to pocket. The utility from pocketing money is
described by u(ei − η), which u is a strictly concave utility function, and ei represents
the service expenditure by an incumbent i.9
After the service provision period, the electoral stage starts with the incumbent and
the challenger campaigning. The challenger and the voters do not observe the optimal
service investment level, but the challenger observes the amount of money invested by
the incumbent politician (ei , for all i). The challenger faces no entry costs and has the
opportunity to use the negative campaign to convince the voters that the incumbent
has embezzled public funds.10 If she decides to use all of her campaign resources to
expose the corrupt politician, she pays a cost c > 0. Her chances of success depend on
the strength of the corruption evidence, plus other environmental facts, such as how
much control over information incumbents have Ferraz and Finan (2011); Boas and
Hidalgo (2011), credibility perceived by the voter (Polborn and David 2006; Ashworth
and Shotts 2011), access to privileged information, and the challengers’ competence
to spread the information among voters. I assume that these factors are captured by
a corruption detection technology, a function λ(.) that is increasing on the amount
9

This assumption matches a frequent empirical regularity in the political environment, especially in
new democracies: corruption tend to be over-investments, meaning that politicians add kickbacks and
gifts to procurement contracts, receiving benefits them. Usually, what happens is not that voters fail
to receive the services, it is that those services cost much more than their market value. For instance,
Bandiera et al. (2009) estimated that the waste in procurement account for around 2% of the Italian GDP.
10
This assumption is strong, as many papers demonstrated the effect of quality and service provision
on the decision to challenge an incumbent (Gordon et al. 2007; Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita 2008;
Gordon et al. 2009; Hall and Snyder 2015). In this paper, I endogenously fix the number of incumbents
and challengers, as the critical point here is to study how the number of politicians influences incentives.
In the Appendix, I extend the model to have a pool of possible challengers that have their entry costs a
random variable. In the extension, the total pool of likely entrants becomes the critical variable, holding
all qualitative findings here unchanged. Therefore, to fix the number of entrants is easier to understand,
and represents a class of models that preserve the characteristics of our results, than we adopt this
approach in the main text. Also, for the entry decision in economics, see Milgrom and Roberts (1982);
Nti (1989).

embezzled by the incumbents. It increases with the amount embezzled, as the more
money the incumbent pockets, the easier to convince voters that there is hard evidence
of malfeasance undertaken by the incumbents.11
Finally, as the voters’ decisions are sequentially rational, upon observing hard corruption evidence, they punish the incumbent electing the challenger. Otherwise, the
claim that the incumbent is corrupt is interpreted as a cheap talk by the voters.12 Thus,
the voter only punishes the incumbent when the challenger presents and convinces the
voters that there is hard evidence of malfeasance. The game then ends, and payoffs
are realized. The timeline for this model is as follows:
1. Nature draws the optimal investment level to provide the public services.
2. The incumbent observes the optimal investment level and choose the expenditure.
3. The election starts with the challenger choosing her campaign strategy.
4. Voters observe the campaign and choose whether to retain or dismiss the incumbent.
The strategic decisions in this game are the expenditure level chosen by the incumbent (ε), the fraction of time that the challenger invests in exposing the corrupt
incumbent (ϕ), and the voter’s decision to retain or dismiss the incumbent. Condensing the discussion above, we have the following expected utility functions. For the
incumbents:

Ui (εi ; η, ϕ∗ , υ ∗ , ε∗−i ) = u(εi − η) + B P(υi = 1 | ψ, d)
11

There are two ways to interpret the hard evidence detection technology. First, it can be exposure of
hard corruption evidence that was brought by a law enforcement agency, such as the FBI in the US or the
General Comptroller Agency in Brazil. Second, it can be information uncovered during the campaign
process by candidates or former allies that turned to the opposition. Either way, we consider that the
process is noisy, but more substantial sums of money embezzled makes its detection easier.
12
Note that it is not ex-ante rational to always dismiss (never dismiss) the politicians, even when
the voters know that politicians are corrupt. This because always dismissing (never dismissing) would
generate equilibrium where politicians always spend the total amount of resources, regardless of how
much is needed to provide the services.

Where B is the reward for staying in office (assumed the same for every player)
and P(υi = 1 | ψ, d) is the probability of being retained, given ψ and the exposure

With c > 0 being the cost of performing one full corruption exposure. Notice that
the total amount spent on exposing corrupt politicians will be the sum of the amounts
spent on each exposure. The representative voter’s expected utility is equal to:

UV (ψ, d, υ) = 1{ψ = G}rG
Where 1 is the indicator function for ψ = G and rG the value of the public good
for the voter. Notice that no ψ = B is observed on the equilibrium path, as underspending is a dominated strategy.
Any retention rule selected for the voters is sequentially rational because there is
no uncertainty about the results when they cast their votes. I impose the retention rule
for the voter to be to dismiss all incumbents when ψ = B or replace incumbents that
were successfully exposed by challengers when ψ = G. This rule is ex-post efficient as
over-dismissal would make incumbents pocket all the money regardless of η.
I solve this game for a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (Fudenberg and Tirole 1991a,b),
and as this is a signaling game, I also use universal divinity as the equilibrium selection
criteria (Banks and Sobel 1987).13
Definition 1. A Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium for the game described, with |I| = K and
|C| = L, K and L in N, type space T = [0, A], consists in optimal strategies ε∗ , ϕ∗ , υ ∗ and
beliefs µ∗ , that satisfy
13

The restriction imposed by the universal divinity requires that the challengers, facing a deviation
from the equilibrium path, put probability one on the type that is more likely to deviate. Moreover,
as we have a continuum of types, we use the approach by Malaith (1987), which consists in finding
the monotonicity in the payoffs and single crossing conditions, characterizing the behavior of the types
inside the intervals of the type space, analyzing the incentives to pool or separate among the types.

1. ∀ti ∈ T , ε∗i (ti ) maximizes Ui (εi ; ti , ϕ∗ , υ ∗ , ε∗−i ) ∀i ∈ {1, · · · , K}.
2. ∀ε ∈ [0, A]K and ψ ∈ {B, G}, ϕ∗j (ε, ψ) maximizes Uj (ϕj ; ϕ∗−j , υ ∗ , ε∗ , µ∗ ), ∀j ∈
{1, · · · , L}
3. ∀ψ ∈ {B, G} and d ∈ {0, 1}L , υ ∗ (ψ, d) maximizes UV (ψ, d, υ ∗ ).
4. The beliefs are derived using Bayes rule whenever possible, and for all εi that are off-theequilibrium path, µ∗ (ti |εi ) > 0 (in fact, 1) only if εbi ∈ arg minti p(ti , εbi ), where p(ti , εbi )
is the profit from deviating from εi to ε̃i for a type ti .
Note four characteristics of the model proposed. First, the incumbent politicians
always embezzle some amount in equilibrium. Second, conditional on the benefits
from holding office, to spend less than the optimal investment is harmful to the incumbent. In concrete terms, this means that politicians’ first aim is to be elected. If the
voter always dismisses the politician, then the politician will always say that the good
costs A. Third, the voters always receive the public goods, regardless of the amount
of money embezzled. The voter decides to punish the corrupt incumbent to discipline
the incumbent’s behavior, minimizing the rents extracted. Finally, this model has no
ideological proximity, or affinity between the voter and any of the politicians: the paper aims to explore the incentives for corruption, not the trade-offs between ideology
and corruption. Ideology is vital to understand why voters may not want to punish a
corrupt politician, but this is not the main point of this paper, and adding this to the
paper only blurs the logic of the argument. I now solve the model for the scenarios
relevant to this paper.

3.1

One incumbent and one challenger

Applying backward induction, the voters retain the incumbent if the policy result was
good and no corruption was exposed. From the challenger’s perspective, as there is no
cost of entry, she decides whether to invest or not her campaign resources in exposing
the incumbent. She does so when the expected utility of exposing is higher than or

12

equal the expected utility of not exposing, given her beliefs about the real value of η.
Thus:

incumbent is:

Therefore, the optimal strategy for the incumbent politician is to add a kickback κ
to the cost for providing the public good. The incumbent devises the optimal kickback
to make the challenger indifferent between expose or not the corrupt incumbent. The
optimal kickback is increasing in the cost of the negative campaign and decreasing in
the benefit of holding office.
The incumbent, on the other hand, only plays this strategy when it is incentive
compatible for her. To be an optimal response, it should be a arg max for UI . Taking
the derivative of UI , and setting it to zero gives us the following differential equation

The remainder of the proof and the demonstration that this strategy is indeed an
equilibrium is in the Appendix. Note three critical features on this equilibrium. First,
an increase in the value of office (B) decreases the kickbacks extracted and the amount
of negative campaign. Decreases kickbacks because it becomes more profitable to be
reelected vis-a-vis extract rents, and lowers the amount of negative campaign because
there are fewer opportunities to detect corrupt behavior. Second, increasing the costs
of exposing corruption (c) increases the kickbacks and decreases the amount of exposure in equilibrium. Finally, increasing the gains from extracting rents (increasing u0 )
does not change the amount of extraction, but increases the amount of negative campaign, as a form to cope with the possibility of deviating from the equilibrium. These
results are intuitive but demonstrate that the model follows a reasonable logic.15
15

Moreover, many electoral models display non-monotonicities, such as U or inverted U-shaped relations. Note this model is monotonic because we are not considering the trivial case when L = 0. When
the election is uncontested, politicians always embezzle A, and voters have no alternative option.

3.2

One incumbent and many challengers

Let |I| = 1 and |C| = L. Starting with the voters, their optimal strategy is to retain
the incumbent if the incumbent provides the public good and no corruption has been
uncovered. If the voters dismiss the incumbent, they randomly select a challenger
with equal probability.16
Challengers observe ψ and ε and have to simultaneously compute the time to invest in negative campaign ϕi . As challengers have the same utility function, we solve
for a symmetric equilibrium. Let λ(ε − η) = λε . If we have k players investing in a negative campaign against the incumbent politician, the probability that the incumbent
gets successfully exposed and lose the election is:
L−1  
X
L k
f (ϕ, x) =
ϕ (1 − ϕ)L−1−k · (1 − (1 − λε )k+x )
k
k=0

So when i decides to commit all her resources in a negative campaign, we let x = 1
in f . This strategy allows us to compute the expected utility for the challenger i as:
B
L

f (ϕ, 0)µ(η|ε)dµ + ϕi

0

B
L

Z

A


(f (ϕ, 1) − f (ϕ, 0)) µ(η|ε)dµ − c

0

Sequential rationality requires that ϕi > 0 when this quantity is greater than zero,
and zero otherwise. After some algebra, we can rewrite the critical term in the decision
process as an equation G:

G(λ, ϕ; L) = (1 − ϕλε )L−1 λε − Q(B, c)L
c
. This equation yields
B
to the optimal ε. The problem is that we will have, for each value of ε, a corresponding

optimal value of ϕ, and vice-versa. As the incumbent plays first, she can choose the

One might think that an optimal scheme would be to reward the challengers that uncovered the
corruption scandal. The problem with this consideration is twofold: first, once the corruption has been
detected, all challengers could use these facts in their campaigns, making the corruption exposure a
“non-excludable good.” Second, even if we consider that challengers inherit the votes from the exposed incumbent, the collective action remains, as every challenger will have incentives for negative
campaign, but if all do, the voter will keep choosing by chance. The equilibrium changes slightly but
qualitatively, it is still worse than just one challenger.

possible. For a numerical example, if we assume Q = 0.15 and L ranging from 1 to 5,
we can have a contour for the possible values for λ in Figure 1.

Making G = 0 yields to the following optimal incumbent expenditure strategy:

ε∗ (η) = η + λ−1 (Q(B, c) · L) = η + κ(L)
Again, the actual value required to provide the service plus a kickback comprises
the incumbent strategy. The kickback has the same characteristics expressed in the case
with one challenger, except now it is augmented linearly by the number of challengers
contesting the seat. In order to this expenditure profile be incentive compatible it has
to satisfy the following differential equation in δ(ε):

And the δ(.) defined as in the Appendix.
The proof with the step-by-step derivations is in the Appendix. Note here that all
the comparative statics with relation to the benefit from holding office, the costs of exposing corrupt politicians, and the utility of rent extractions remain unchanged. The
fundamental differences here are the effect of the number of challengers: it increases
the kickbacks while decreasing the incentives for investigating the corrupt incumbent.
18

The reason is intuitive: the more challenger added, the more the collective action problem faced by the challengers. For every individual challenger, it is better to let someone
else pay the cost of a negative campaign but if all challengers reason similarly no exposures are performed in equilibrium. Thus, adding challengers increase the incentives
for corruption.

3.3

Many incumbents and challengers

In multi-member districts there are more than one incumbent. All proportional representation countries use some variety of multi-member districts to elect representatives
to their parliaments.17 The following Lemma summarizes the case when there are
many incumbents and many challengers.
Lemma 3. A Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium for the game when there are K incumbents and L
challengers is a pair of strategies and beliefs such that

Proportional representation systems elect many representatives within a district, but also use apportionment rules to ensure proportional distribution of votes to parties. With the only difference that
the apportionment rules may generate a few differences in the translation between votes and seats, in
general, our representation encompasses the main features in a PR systems.

And the δ(.) defined as in the Appendix.
The full derivation resembles the case with many challengers, and we leave for
the Appendix. Qualitatively, the addition of more incumbents aggravate the collective
action problems in two aspects. First, we have the free-riding problem, as politicians
prefer to leave others to pay the exposing costs. Second, the absence of coordination
among rival politicians increases the chances that challengers target some incumbents
more than others.

3.4

Summarizing the effects of the number of incumbents and challengers

The following corollary summarizes the effects found above:
Corollary 1. Let the strategic interaction as summarized in the previous Lemmas. Then,
increasing the number of challengers increases the incentives for corruption, as it promotes
free-riding in the corruption exposures by challengers. Increasing the number of incumbents
increases even further the incentives for corruption by promoting free-riding and coordination
failures in the corruption exposures.
In equilibrium, the maximum incentive to embezzle happens when we add challengers and incumbents simultaneously. Lowering the amount of either one of them
decrease the incentives for corruption, as denouncing the wrongdoing by incumbents
become more profitable for challengers. We thus have the following testable hypotheses:
H. 1 Increasing the number of seats, keeping all other characteristics constant, increase corruption.

20

H. 2 Increasing the number of competitors, keeping all other characteristics constant,
increase corruption.
These hypotheses can be rephrased concerning the incentives they produce for
challengers to use corruption information against incumbents. However, phrasing
about corruption incentives has the advantage to lead to testable implications.

Corruption, incentives, and institutions:

evidence

from Brazililian municipalities
Empirical evidence shows that electoral rules affect corruption. However, papers
present often-contradictory evidence, due to the difficulty of isolating the causes of
corruption using observational data. To remedy this gap, I study two quasi-natural
experiments in the Brazilian context: the exogenous population thresholds for the legislature size and competition (Cepaluni and Mignozzetti 2015; Britto and Fiorin 2016)
and population threshold for run-off (Ferraz and Finan 2011; Fujiwara et al. 2011).18
The results confirm that competitiveness and district sizes are key for corruption.

4.1

Data, Sources of Variation, and Identification Strategy

To construct the dependent variable, I use two different codings for the Brazilian Municipal Audit program. This program was launched in 2003 by the Brazilian Federal
government, and since 2004 it consists of a federal audit of a random lottery of 60
municipalities. Federal auditors go to each selected town collecting evidence of inefficiencies and corruption with the use of federal transfers. Brollo et al. (2013) and
Avelino et al. (2016) coded these lotteries, each with a different focus. Brollo et al.
(2013) coded the lotteries 2 to 29, looking for broad irregularities (incompetence) and
narrow irregularities (corruption). Avelino et al. (2016) coded the lotteries 8 to 33, with
18

Some of these results were found originally by Ferraz and Finan (2011) for runoff, and by Britto and
Fiorin (2016) for legislature size. I replicate their findings, mainly confirming their original assessment,
and providing microfoundations for their results.

21

the focus on health care transfers, coding the frequency of detected malfeasance events,
and the amount involved.
I use two population thresholds as an exogenous variation for competition, legislature size (city council district size), and competition in single-member district elections (mayoral elections). First, in 2004, the Brazilian Electoral Court ruled that the
29th Federal Constitution article that assumes a range from 9 to 21 city councilors
for municipalities with less than a million inhabitants be miss-interpreted by towns.
The court suggested that each municipal council should start with nine councilors,
adding one councilor for every 47,619 inhabitants, which is the ratio of a million divided by 21 councilors. The electoral justice enforced the population thresholds for
the council during two terms: 2004 and 2008. In 2009, the Congress amended the constitution, changing the council sizes and other council characteristics (Cepaluni and
Mignozzetti 2015; Britto and Fiorin 2016). We use these thresholds as a shock on district size, and also on the competition. This because district size varies sharply with
legislature size, pushing competition to also increase with these threshold variations.
Second, the Brazilian electoral law mandates that municipalities with more than 200
thousand inhabitants should have a run-off for their mayoral elections (Fujiwara et al.
2011). This emulates a single-member district with one competitor dispute (run-off),
versus a single-member district with more than one competitor (no run-off). Figure 2
illustrates the empirical strategy.
The model starts with the institution design to measure the corruption impacts, but
the empirical strategy abstracts away from the precise formulation in order to estimate
the model. There are two key changed features. First, it assumes that competition relates to district size. Second, it abstracts the role of challengers, assuming that it is
working on the background as postulated by the formal model. For the first caveat, I
also run robustness checks, splitting the sample into above and below the median competition per seat, and the results remain as postulated (above the median the coefficient
is more significant). For the second point, I show in the appendix qualitative evidence
that negative campaign and corruption claims, especially aimed against mayors, are

Results

On the top of Figure 3 I apply the empirical strategy for Brollo et al. (2013) broad and
narrow irregularities detection, and below I estimate the same models for Avelino et al.
(2016) data on incidence and amount of discovered malfeasance on health care transfers. To keep our approach consistent, I limit the data to the 2005-2008 mayoral term.
The results follow below.
I divide the results into four quadrants, plotting the coefficients for each model I
run, based on the strategy presented in Figure 2.19 In the top-left, the broad corrup19

I run an instrumental variable regression using the legislator threshold cutoffs as an exogenous
shock for candidacy, regression discontinuity design for city council size, and t-test, selecting the municipalities close to the run-off cutoff, for a run-off. The reason for not running an RDD for the run-off is
the fact that there were too few cases in the right-hand size (municipalities with more than 200 thousand
voters). To emulate an RDD result I restrict the sample to the municipalities with 50 thousand voters
around the 200 thousand run-off threshold.

tion findings represent inefficiency detection. As the model has no prior hypothesis
on inefficiency, I keep it here as a placebo check, in order to study a possible oversensitivity of the empirical model. As the Figure shows, no coefficient is significant for
inefficiency detection.
In the top-right I present the results for Brollo et al. (2013) narrow corruption
charges. These estimates work as expected: more competition and larger district sizes
increase the chance of detect corruption 24% and 56%, respectively. Run-off decreases
the amount of corruption 67%.

24

In the bottom-left we examine the Avelino et al. (2016) frequency of detected corruption in health care.20 As we can see, one standard deviation increase in candidates
running for mayor and council increase in 20% and 12% the frequency of detected
malfeasance, respectively.21 The other coefficients are in the predicted direction, but
not significant at 10 or 5% levels.
Finally, in the bottom right we have the fraction of healthcare investments where
the auditors detected incidences of corruption. Consistent with the model predictions,
adding one standard deviation of mayoral and city council competitors increase the
investments with corruption irregularities by 15% and 9%, respectively. Having runoff decreases the investments with corruption by 47%. The city council size coefficient
is in the predicted direction, but not significant at the conventional levels.
In sum, the empirical results largely confirm the hypotheses H1 and H2 derived
from the formal model. In the appendix we run a few robustness and placebo checks,
to test whether the findings here are resistant to small specification changes. All results
remain consistent and significant in the majority of the different specifications.

Conclusion

This paper lays out the micro-foundations for the relation between corruption and
electoral rules. It shows that challengers and incumbents have different incentives
to investigate or engage in corruption activity in equilibrium. It also tests the theory using quasi-experimental variation, showing that the incentives generated by the
institutions key for political corruption.
Electoral systems are embedded into an array of trade-offs, and also generate many
other political and representational effects within the society. Majoritarian systems are
great for accountability, as they foster clarity of responsibility (Tavits 2007; Xezonakis
20

Health care is a good outcome of studying corruption incidence because it consumes a considerable
portion of the municipal budget (around 25%), and most voters in Brazil reward handsomely a good
public healthcare administration (Fujiwara 2015).

One standard deviation for the competition variables is 1.04 and 4.6 competitors for mayor and
city council, respectively. See the Appendix for the full list of descriptive statistics.

et al. 2015), and as this paper shows, they also promote lower levels of corruption.
However, they also tend to be highly polarizing and have a considerable amount of
wasted votes, which grow steadily with the number of candidates credibly competing
for the seat. On the other extreme, proportional representation systems ensure less
wasted votes, but parties proliferate on it. It quickly becomes ungovernable without
broad coalitions and inter-party agreements, which are usually rigged by corruption
in developing economies (Mello and Spektor 2018).
To some extent, this paper delivers a very synthetic result: the incentives for engagement and for exposing corrupt behavior are dependent on the collective action
problems generated within the political system. The results favor single-member districts with just one competitor when it comes to corruption. However, in between
the extremes of single-member districts and full open-list proportional representation,
some institutions work positively in fighting corruption.
First, the existence of run-offs, such as in the French parliament, improves corruption outcomes without artificially limit the number of competitors. The run-off compensates the predatory competition that happens in the first round, and politicians
may work to expose corruption by incumbents, lowering the incentives to corrupt behavior.
Second, threshold laws, which are harmful to the inclusion of different cleavages,
may help to avoid predatory competition, decreasing corruption. Third, the results
here tend to favor findings such as Schleiter and Voznaya (2014) and Schleiter and
Voznaya (2016), which claim that strengthening parties in proportional representation systems decrease political corruption, suggesting that closed lists may be better
for lowering corruption. As my model shows, the rationale is because strong parties
may efficiently coordinate the corruption exposures, aiming at taking down not only a
single politician but also an entire corrupt rival party. Stronger parties improve coordination and lower free-riding, especially when there are a limited number of parties.
Finally, small district sizes in proportional representation, such as in the Chilean
electoral system, maybe not only positive for the interplay between representation and

26

accountability (Carey and Hix 2011), but also in lowering corruption, when compared
with large district proportional representation. The Brazilian system, with weak parties, open-list proportional representation, and large district sizes (varying between 8
and 70 legislators) proves that corruption can easily become endemic, with considerable negative impact on the quality of democracy and accountability (Avis et al. 2016;
Mello and Spektor 2018).
