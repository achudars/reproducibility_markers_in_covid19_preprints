This paper examines the national and international growth of prehistoric archaeology in Italy from 1875 to 2000.
A bibliometric approach is proposed for a case study of a scientific discipline, language and period that are poorly represented in current bibliographic databases. These constraints led to the generation of a data set with articles from 5 journals
(2842 articles and 1221 unique authors). Publication language and author nationalities were manually included in the data
set. Journal internationality measures and co-authorship network analyses showed: 1) that internationalisation was not
the most striking change over the study period: it was one of a number of features that journal editors addressed in their
own way; 2) results confirm a change in the social organisation of scientific production in archaeology, with the emergence
of co-authorship and reflect the differentiation of local research trends. This is discussed with reference to previous work
on the history of prehistoric archaeology.

nationalité des auteurs ont été pris en compte. Mesurer l’internationalité des revues et analyser le réseau de co-auteurs
montre : 1) que l’internationalisation ne fut pas le fait le plus marquant de cette période, constituant une ressource – parmi
d’autres – diversement employée par les éditeurs ; 2) une transformation dans l’organisation sociale de la production
(co-autorat) et la différenciation d’orientations locales de recherche, confortant ainsi des études antérieures sur l’histoire
de l’archéologie préhistorique.

LIMITATIONS OF BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES
OF THE (DE)NATIONALIZATION OF SCIENCES

As in others scientific disciplines aiming to
produce a universal knowledge, prehistoric archae-

ology includes an international aim. There are,
however, three specific points which make it of
particular interest when studying internationalisation in science. First, in general, archaeological practises are closely related to international issues, being

a practise made by a cosmopolitan elite or being an
aspect of the cultural diplomacy between states.1
Second, considering the methodological aspects of
historical investigation, archaeology –and specifically archaeology written in a non-English language–
is a scientific discipline that is rarely included in the
main bibliographic databases (e.g. Scopus, Web of
Science). This raises concerning issues when using
such data as historical material. Finally, concerning
the Italian case, the examination of prehistoric
archaeology uncovers recent processes of disciplinarisation and professionalisation2 (compared to
other disciplines, such as biology). Furthermore,
these processes occurred during the fascist period
(1922–1943), marked by particular changes in
Italian international relations and scientific policies. Numerous historical studies have addressed
the growth of prehistoric archaeology in Italy from
its beginnings in the eighteenth century, and its
intellectual characteristics, such as the importance
of the “palethnology” idea. In addition, they have
addressed the creation of organisations dedicated to
the practise of prehistoric archaeology, emphasising
their role in the development framework of the
Italian state and in the fascist regime.3
Scientific internationalism has been an important issue since the nineteenth century, and was
redefined after both World Wars in the twentieth century.4 In general, relations between
national identities and institutions, and scientific
practises have been studied continuously by historians and sociologists of science.5 During the last
decades of the twentieth century, concepts such
as “transnational” science or “glocalization” were
proposed by authors in social studies of science.
Subsequently, they were enthusiastically adopted
by historians of archaeology.6 National frameworks
for the history of science have been criticised,
arguing that this approach lacks the intrinsic international features of science and deserves a narrative of national legitimization. As Crawford et al.

emphasised, “denationalisation” was the main
trend during the 1980s and early 1990s. These
authors also argued, however, that analysing the
relationships between national frameworks and
scientific activities on a broader time-scale shows
that: 1) trends of (de)nationalisation occurred periodically throughout the history of science; 2) that
these processes were achieved by various methods
including the emergence of spontaneous associations, state bureaucracy policies, the migration of
scientists, and the creation of “locally-grounded
transnational research sites”.7
Such insights suggest that the main problem
is not the investigation of contrasting national and
international scientific practises, but the empirical examination of the various forms of (inter)
nationalisation. Concerning the latter, for decades,
sociologists and historians of science have used a
wide range of specific data set to examine scientific activities, including: scientific production
(actors’ involvement in fieldwork, publication
languages, patents and publications), socialisation (affiliation to institutions, participation in
conferences), reception or visibility (citations).
These data are used to address “internationality”
in different ways, including cognitive perspectives
(e.g. relationships between documents), spatial
perspectives (analysing their global or national
distribution), and social perspectives (e.g. co-authorship or co-presence of actors at conferences).
However, as noted by Buela et al. on scientometric
approaches, accounts of internationality often
lack a precise definition of this concept and of the
methods used for its empirical study.8 In addition,
actors’ understanding of internationality in science
can change over time.9 Similar criticism on qualitative approaches has also been made by Heilbron
about comparative studies of national traditions in
science.10 On one hand, promoters of qualitative
approaches are often reluctant, also for political
reasons, to consider bibliometric and scientometric

approaches. On the other hand, even if bibliometric data have been used for decades as sources
for the history of science,11 these studies often lack
a precise historical or sociological contextualisation
of the bibliographic data under study.
To address this limitation, this paper focuses on
a case (i.e. a scientific field, language, and period)
that is poorly represented in the main bibliometric
databases of today: namely, prehistoric archaeology
in Italy from 1875 to 2000. In this framework, the
relationship between bibliographic data and its
socio-historical contexts can be explored. I propose
an approach combining general information from
bibliographic statistics and fine-grained information
from qualitative data. After presenting the materials, I discuss the results starting with an examination of the growth of actors and publications
related to prehistoric archaeology in Italy. Journal
internationality measures are then presented and,
finally, I analyse the co-authorship network of
involved archaeologists from 1875 to 2000.

AN ENRICHED BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA SET

The data set12 includes all the articles published
in 5 journals between 1875 and 2000 (tab. 1).
These journals were selected as they cover the
broadest range of prehistoric archaeology studies
in Italy. Some were included for specific reasons:
the Bullettino di paletnologia italiana (BPI) has the

widest chronological range, allowing for longterm observations; the Rivista di scienze preistoriche
(RSP), Origini. Preistoria e protostoria delle civiltà
antiche and Quaternaria. Storia naturale e culturale
del Quaternario are amongst the most important
prehistoric archaeology journals in Italy; and
Archivio di tipologia analitica (ATA) has interesting
characteristics regarding the internationalisation
of science, that I detail below. The journal data
set is chronologically limited to 2000 for consistency with the publication period of the ATA which
ended in 1998.
As the main bibliographic databases poorly
represented scientific articles in archaeology and
languages other than English,13 I constructed the
data set by combining information extracted from
the following sources: direct examination of the
journals, the PreBiblio,14 Dialnet,15 and Google Scholar
databases. This information was organised into
3 tables: articles (n=2842), authors (n=1221), and
relations between articles and authors (n=3366).
The languages of the articles were described
manually as well as the nationality of the authors
(this biographical feature has been used instead of
authors’ institutional affiliations which are generally used in bibliometric studies as it is easier to
retrieve from databases). Nationality was known
from my previous research for about half of the
authors, and for the other half, it was determined
through searching archaeological publications or
on the internet.

GROWTH IN ITALIAN PREHISTORIC
ARCHAEOLOGY ACTIVITIES

Numerical results
The analysis of publications and of (new)
authors growth rates identified two phases during
the 1875–2000 period (fig. 1): a first phase from
1875 to 1946 (only documented by the BPI),
and a second phase from 1950 to 2000. During
both phases and for both series, growth rates are
constant but they are higher during the second
period.16 This reflects an increase in the number
of actors (single authors) and publications during
this phase. Furthermore, during the first phase, the
growth rate of publications is slightly higher than
the growth rate of actors but this reverses during
the second phase. The number of authors by paper
–namely the practise of co-authorship– increased
in the second half of the twentieth century (see
fig. 1, with greyscale indicating the annual proportions of the number of authors by publication).
However, single authorship remained the major
trend in this period (about 50% of the publications).

Periodisation
Tarantini proposed three phases in the development of prehistoric archaeology in Italy from
1925 to 1962, distinguished by the years 1935 and
1946.17 This model can be compared to the phases
observed above.
Luigi Pigorini (1842–1925) was a prominent
figure in Italian prehistoric research. In 1875
he created the BPI (with Gaetano Chierici and
Pellegrino Strobel) and, one year later, he founded
the Museo Preistorico Etnografico di Roma. His
death occurred at the beginning of the fascist
regime, a period in which his scientific and organisational legacy had to be transferred to other people.
As a consequence, fascist-minded actors held some
of the highest positions in the Museum and in the
BPI. Tarantini selected 1935 as the beginning of the
subsequent phase, corresponding to a change in

the fascist policy towards a systematic occupation
of the cultural spaces and the promotion of racism.
Also in this year, Paolo Orsi, the director of the BPI,
died. The journal’s board was redefined, and board
members were only classic archaeologists in favour
of the racist orientations.18 These ideological and
personal changes had no effect on the quantitative
growth of actors in prehistoric archaeology or on
the growth of the BPI.
In 1946, following the end of World War II
and the fascist regime, a new phase in archaeology began, characterised by the creation of
numerous organisations devoted to prehistoric
archaeology and by the recovery of international

relations. In addition to the journals presented
in tab. 1, it is important to mention the creation
of the Centro Emiliano di Studi Preistorici in 1948,
and its journal entitled Emilia Preromana, and of
the Centro di Studi Preistorici e Archeologici di Varese
in 1953 with its journal Sibrium. In 1950, the first
Congresso Internazionale di Preistoria e Protostoria
Mediterranea was held in Florence, Rome, and
Naples. The observed stable growth rates reflect
Tarantini’s statement on the increase of activity
in prehistoric archaeology during the 1946–1962
phase. The generation of researchers in the early
1960s –university-trained contrary to their predecessors–19 had an important role in the creation of
journals.

(INTER)NATIONALITY AND AIMS OF JOURNALS

Results
Internationality of the journals was determined by analysing the nationalities of the authors
and the languages of their articles. A total of
42 different nationalities (tab. 2) and 6 different
languages (tab. 3) was observed in the full data set.
Graphic representations of the proportion of the
main represented nationalities (fig. 2) and languages
(fig. 3) over time are given. Although the BPI had few
articles in non-Italian languages before 1950, we see
that linguistic and national diversification occurred
during the second half of the twentieth century, after

Quaternaria, whose rate of non-Italian authors
increased significantly from the mid-1960s.
For a quantitative and comparative account
of these evolutions the study period was divided

into 7 periods delimited by the years the journals
started and ended; journals’ linguistic and national
diversities for each period were assessed using a
measure called Rarefaction20 (fig. 4). This measure,
as well as Shannon-Weaver diversity index,21 was
also computed by journal without consideration
for the time (tab. 4).

authors than expected. Origini and the RSP had a
balanced distribution of authors, but the RSP had
more Spanish authors than expected.
2) For languages, similar trends were found.
The majority of BPI articles were Italian, whereas
Quaternaria had a significantly lower frequency of
Italian articles, and higher frequency of English
and of French articles than expected, compared
to the other journals. In the RSP, the frequency
of English articles was significantly below the
expected value, whereas Origini had a balanced
frequency distribution of languages.
These results clearly show that the journals
have different profiles regarding their (inter)
national definitions, which result from contrasting
editorial policies which may themselves have
changed over time.

Results showed that, even if some variations
are observed at the journal scale, journal rankings
were stable for both variable and measure. BPI
had the lowest linguistic and national diversities
values, and Quaternaria had the highest; RSP had
lower and decreasing values during the period
when Quaternaria was in publication. ATA had the
highest linguistic diversity associated with a rather
low national diversity.
In order to detail the journals’ characteristics
χ2 tests were performed on relevant subsets of
tables 2 and 3. For both variables, nationalities and
languages, tests led to reject the null hypothesis
of independence, and determined significant relationships between the variables (nationality and
language) and journals:
1) For nationalities, articles in the BPI had
significantly more Italian authors, and fewer
French, American and Spanish authors than
expected.22 Quaternaria had fewer Italian authors,
but more French, American, German and British

22. See supplementary materials for details and examination
of the residuals.

In a study of the notion of “national traditions”
in the social sciences, Heilbron emphasised that –
despite normative claims about the universality
of science– the scientific international space is
historically constructed from national structures.23
Scientific journals are important methods used
in the process of disciplinarisation and can have
different aims. I distinguished three journal functions based on the previous results and consistent
observations made of former studies on the growth
of prehistoric archaeology in Italy: 1) creating and
gathering national publications; 2) supporting a
specific research orientation; 3) promoting a local
international hub.
The BPI typically fulfilled the first aim and
historically has been the only Italian journal devoted
to prehistoric archaeology.24 After Quaternaria
ceased publication, my results have shown that
the Italian language and actors dominated in the
four other journals. This is consistent with results
of other bibliometric studies on archaeology.
Kristiansen published a synthesis paper analysing
the languages of articles cited in some of the main
European prehistoric archaeology journals and
in general books published in the last decades
of twentieth century (1980–2000). It showed a
“European trend towards single language research

environments” in several countries: e.g. German
tends to dominate in German journals, English in
British journals.25

Supporting a specific orientation
The growth of prehistoric archaeology in
Italy included a double process of intellectual and
spatial distinctions; specific approaches to prehistoric archaeology were promoted by different
and newly created organisations located in the
main cities. Journals were a method to mark and
to develop these distinctions. In 1954 a significant conflict arose when the Roman “schools”
was opposed by Florence actors who created the
Istituto Italiano di Preistoria e Protostoria and a
new journal, the RSP, aimed to support new ways
to associate historical and natural approaches in
prehistoric archaeology.26 A decade later, when
Salvatore M. Puglisi (1912–1985) created the
Origini journal at the University of Rome, he also
took part in the debate on the general approach
in prehistoric archaeology by favouring a historical and anthropological approach. The medium
internationalisation scores of Origini (see results)
may be related to this focus on the internal Italian
debate, although Origini was not closed to foreign
influences, as illustrated by the promotion of
English approaches by Puglisi.27 In contrast, the
founder of the RSP, Paolo Graziosi (1906–1988),
intended this journal to gather Italian publications
in prehistoric archaeology and to strengthen international relations.28 However, the RSP, similar to
Origini, showed relatively low internationalisation scores. These two journals contrast with the
Quaternaria, whose aim was defined as being a
“means of international connexion” by A.C. Blanc
in the introduction of the first issue.

A local means of internationalisation
Quaternaria was founded in 1954 by Alberto
Carlo Blanc (1906–1960). Son of Gian Alberto
Blanc (1879–1966, an internationally renowned
geochemist and archaeologist), A.C. Blanc was

an important figure in the 1950s. He made strong
international commitments,29 but became progressively more isolated in the Italian environment.30
In 1953, he organised the 4th Congress of the
International Union for Quaternary Research
(INQUA) in Pisa and Rome. Indeed, Quaternaria
was created as an INQUA journal, though edited
in Rome and was included in the activities of the
Istituto italiano di paleontologia umana. So, likewise
Crawford’s et al. “locally-grounded transnational
research sites”, it has been a resource to promote
the local (national) growth of prehistoric archaeology in Italy –a country then rather marginal in
this field– through a specific commitment to internationalisation.
Similarly, previous bibliometric studies on
archaeology emphasised the higher internationality of “small” scientific countries (based on
local reception rather than local production, by
analysing the cited publications languages). In a
case study of the Baltic countries, Lang analysed a
set of Estonian, Finnish and Swedish publications
(a definition of the data set is not provided, each
set is said to be about 4000 items) and showed the
high linguistic diversity of their cited works.31 In
another study, Kristiansen showed that, contrary
to Germany or the United Kingdom, smaller
countries as Sweden and Hungary had a higher
linguistic diversity in their citations in the 1980–
2000 period.32

Limitations of the typology: localising
the universal
My results have suggested that journal editors
can assign and combine aims at different scales
(local, national, international) for their journal. A
striking example is illustrated by the ATA.
This very specific publication is closely related
to the typologie analytique method, developed from
the mid-1950s by French archaeologist Georges
Laplace (1918–2004), who conducted a significant part of his first investigations in Italy.33 This
method integrated a taxonomy, a set of metric
coefficients and their relative graphic representa-

tions, an articulated set of statistical procedures
and a coded notation for the description of prehistoric stone tools.34 This method aimed to surpass
the numerous locally-defined lithic typologies in
various natural languages. However, due to the
difficulties encountered by the promoters of this
method, work using the typologie analytique were
published in non-French conventional journals
(especially Italian)35 and in the journal of Laplace’s
research group,36 Dialektikê, published by the participants of an annual seminar (1969–1987). Members
of the young Italian generation of archaeologists
also participated, including Paolo Gambassini. He
contributed to diffusing this method, from his position at the University of Siena, by creating the ATA
journal in 1973. This journal aimed to publish lists
of coded descriptions of lithic objects according to
the typologie analytique format. These lists, introduced by a short note written in a natural language,
complemented a previous publication in a conventional journal. By their research and teaching,
the members of this young generation made the
typologie analytique the specific approach of their
respective prehistoric archaeology departments,
namely in Siena (e.g. P. Gambassini, Annamaria
Ronchitelli), Florence (e.g. Fabio Martini, Lucia
Sarti) and Ferrara (Alberto Broglio). This distanced
themselves from Laplace’s research group and

the method, so promoting a stabilised definition
for their group. In some ways, the universal aim of
the typologie analytique was turned into a resource
that supported local developments. Collaborations
between these authors contributed to the differentiation of research trends in Italy, which I will now
address by a co-authorship network analysis.
THE GROWTH OF CO-AUTHORSHIP FROM THE
1950S

Co-authorship relations can be mathematically represented with graphs (“networks”):
two authors are tied if they authored a publication together. Aggregated co-author relations
form groups of indirectly grouped authors called

34. See Laplace-Jauretche 1957 and, for an extended presentation, Laplace 1974.

“connected components”: for instance, author A
never wrote a publication with author C, but both
of them are indirectly tied through their relation
to author B with whom they have both written
a publication (fig. 5). Depending on the empirical
situation, the resulting graph is not necessarily a
connected graph (a graph in which there is a path
between every pair of vertices): it can be composed
of several independent “connected components”,
which are interpreted as groups of collaborating
authors.

Co-authorship relationships among 6 authors (white dots) who cosigned 3 publications (A, B, C). This graph has only two connected
components.
S. Plutniak.

The following results have been obtained from
analysing a series of cumulative annual co-authorship graphs: for each year a graph was computed
by summing the relations created in the given year
and those of previous years. This mode of construction is justified by the idea that, from an actor’s
viewpoint, a co-authorship relation can have an
influence on his subsequent actions; furthermore,
from a bibliographical viewpoint, a co-authorship
relation remains indefinitely in the scientific literature (unless the publication is never referenced).

The co-authorship network in
the second half of twentieth century
The co-authorship graph is composed of
numerous connected components, due to the high
number of articles with a single authorship (in
2000, the graph has 668 connected components).
Analysing the proportional size of the largest three
connected components shows that groups of collab-

orating authors only began to emerge in the early
1960s (fig. 6). Note that because these graphs are
cumulative, a component can only get new relations or stay unchanged between two consecutive
years. Contrary to the first component, the second
and third components show phases of increase and
decrease, always representing less than 5% of the
size of the annual graph for a given year. Increases
reflect growth in the groups of connected authors,
while decreases are due to their integration in a
larger component.
This scenario of the formation of the Italian
prehistoric archaeology field, characterised by
a progressive increase of collaborations, was
confirmed by analysing the transitivity of these
relations. Transitivity is a measure of the extent
to which authors tend to co-author with the
co-authors of their co-authors, so forming triangles.37 Resulting values range between 0 (absence
of triangles) and 1 (all nodes are part of triangles). Transitivity was computed for each year for

the complete graph and for its largest connected
component (not the second, third and other
components as their nodes change over time).
The interpretation of the evolution of transitivity must acknowledge that these co-authorship
graphs are cumulative: an increase in transitivity
reflects a new relation between authors who previously haven’t worked together. A decrease reflects
the arrival of new authors who have not co-authored with the already collaborating authors, or
who have collaborated with some of them but not
with their previous co-authors.
In the complete graph, the transitivity score
shows significant variation until the 1970s when it
reaches its highest value of 0.72: after this period
the score slowly and steadily decreases (fig. 7).
This reflects a slight degree of collaboration with
the newcomers in the field, even if –as already
stated– their numbers still increase during the
period (see fig. 1).

components in the co-authorship graph.

37. Most of the definitions of the transitivity rely on the
distinction between triplet (set of three connected nodes)
and triangle (set of three nodes all connected to each other).
Here, transitivity is the number of triangles over the total
number of triplets in the graph.

427
Fluctuations of transitivity in the largest
component are less significant and globally
increase over the period, reaching its highest value
of 0.53 in the final year (2000). This confirms the
previous observation: the collaboration network
has a centre-periphery structure.
Statistical evaluations of the observed transitivity values computed for the year 2000 show that
the observed values are significantly higher than
expected (for the annual graph and for its largest
connected component).38 This supports the idea that
the structural property of the co-authorship network
is related to some particularities of the authorship
practises in the field of prehistoric archaeology.

Emergence of leading actors
For a detailed analysis of the structure of
the network, centrality measurements were also
computed at the scale of the author. The betweenness centrality value of each actor and the betweenness centralization value for each annual graph were
computed (see definitions in fig. 8).
The increase in global betweenness centralization from the mid-1950s suggests a distinction
process in the co-authorship network (fig. 9). The
network tends to be composed of an increasing
number of dense sub-networks: different phyla
(“traditions”) of collaborators are progressively being formed. At the scale of the actors,
two groups appear: Italian actors, characterised by
an increasing betweenness centrality during the
period; and non-Italian actors, with decreasing
values. This reflects the ongoing structuration of
prehistoric archaeology in Italy from 1950 to 2000:
prominent figures emerged who led their own
research groups (or “traditions”) and occupied
relevant intermediate positions (e.g. A.C. Blanc,
F. Martini, and A. Broglio). The decrease in
betweenness centrality of foreign authors is interpreted as reflecting their specific attachment to
some of these groups. Laplace is the only exception as he kept an important intermediate position,
despite not being Italian.

38. Cug test procedures (Univariate Conditional Uniform
Graph) have been used, which compare the observed
value with those computed on similar randomly generated
graphs. See supplementary materials.

Fig. 8 – Definition of betweenness centrality and betweenness
centralization.
With Node betweenness centrality the shortest paths a node is
part of, which connect other nodes in the graph, the more it is
considered as central in the graph (higher betweenness centrality).
In (a) all the nodes are found at an equal distance from each other,
so their betweenness centrality scores (in grey) are null. In (b)
node C is part of two shortest paths (from A to D and from B to D),
so C has a non-null betweenness centrality score. Betweenness
centralization is a graph-level measure summarising the centrality
scores of the nodes and reflecting the extent in which a graph is
structured around some specific central nodes (Freeman 1979).

National differentiation
in the co-authorship network
In total, there are 42 authors nationalities
in the data set. Their distributions in the first
three components of the co-authorship series
are discussed. Even if the relations are cumulated over time in the co-authorship graph, the
sets of actors related to the first, the second, the
third and the following component size ranks can
change. Changes in the proportional size (in terms
of relation counts) show when this happened; for
instance, in the early 1950s, the second component, which was composed of German, Dutch and
Italian authors, was replaced by a group of Italian
authors (fig. 10).
The main observation is that the structure of
the main part of the co-authorship network was
highly variable until the early 1970s. Afterwards,

the co-authorship graph.

component in the full co-authorship graph.

it stabilised with an Italian-dominated giant first
component and a smaller second component
dominated by French-British actors. The third
component continued to change over the 1970–
2000 period. Note the decreasing importance of
German actors over the complete period, passing
from the first to the second and, in the mid-1950s,
to the third component.
The general relations pattern between authors
of different nationalities were studied by the assortative mixing of the network, which is defined as the
“tendency for vertices in networks to be connected
to other vertices that are like (or unlike) them in
some way”.39 In this co-authorship network, it
evaluates the extent to which actors sharing the
same nationality tend to have more relationships.
A negative value means that authors of the same
nationality tend not to collaborate and a positive
value means, to the contrary, that they significantly
tend to co-author articles together. Results suggest
a decrease in the preferential relations between
actors of the same nationality, from the mid-1950s
to 1980 (fig. 11). This corresponds to the period
when Quaternaria was published. An increase in
national preference is then observed, followed by a
decrease in preference from the late 1980s to 2000.

CONCLUSION: THE HISTORICAL VALUE
OF BIBLIOMETRIC APPROACHES

This case study aimed to address some classic
concepts of bibliometric analyses –such as the transition from national to transnational science– by examining a scientific discipline, language and time
period poorly represented in bibliographic databases used in bibliometric studies. Zitt et al. characterised this transition by the appearance of three
features in scientific productions: indexed journals
(in main bibliographic databases), prominence of
the English language, and concentration in high
impact journals.40 Although my data cannot test
these three aspects, results suggest that a transition
to a transnational model of science did not occur
during the study period.
However, results reflect the structuration and
aggregation of a cognitive and social network at
the national scale, different editorial strategies and
the growth of research trends. A key-finding is that
the most important change did not concern internationalisation, but a change in the social organisation of prehistoric archaeology production, namely
the emergence of co-authorship from the 1950s.
Collaboration is a necessary, but a non-sufficient
condition, for international publications, and internationality is merely one of a number of resources.
To summarise, three phases were distinguished: a
slight international opening; a moderate increase
in internationalisation (either by importing foreign
work or by setting up local international hubs);
and an increase in internationalisation by the
exportation of local resources (assumed but not
observed with these data), according to the shift to
Zitt’s et al. definition of transnational science.
Scientific internationalism is a historic issue
in scientific practise, but it is even more important
today for two main reasons. First, it is an important characteristic of the scientific ethical dimension of science. Joseph Schumpeter’s 1931 norma-

40. Zitt – Perrot – Barré 1998, p. 30.

tive claim that “Science is of no country and does
not bear any homogeneous national traits”41 illustrated this, as well as its embedding in the norm
of universalism by Robert Merton in his classical
definition of the scientific ethos. Second, in recent
years, internationality has become one of the main
parameters for the evaluation and policy setting of
scientific activities. As a consequence, its economic
and political dimensions have become more important, so complementing its ethical aspect. Ethical
and political aspects of internationality have reciprocal effects, challenging analysts of scientific internationality with two types of risk. An epistemological risk: the importance of internationality as an
aspect of the scientific ethos can lead to ideologically
(over-)emphasise the international features of the
scientific practises studied. A methodological and
political risk: being an important parameter for
science policies, the needs of a management-oriented perspective on internationality can lead to
inflating a (quantified) and restrictive definition of
the concept, with feedback effects on the scientific
ethos.
However, none of these risks justify abandoning the study of internationality in science or
the quantified attempts to perform such studies.
Intermediate approaches and methodology,
combining bibliometric and qualitative data have
been recently advocated,42 and this case study
of Italian prehistoric archaeology is intended to
contribute to such an approach. As demonstrated
by the identification of Laplace’s particular position
in the co-authorship network, the use of a large
data set and quantified procedures can capture
fine-grained biographical facts. Future analysis
of this data set will use measurement methods of
internationality at the article-scale, not the journal
scale. This analysis of local production could be
complemented by analysing Italian publications
in non-Italian journals, and the internationality of
the reception of prehistoric archaeology in Italy.
