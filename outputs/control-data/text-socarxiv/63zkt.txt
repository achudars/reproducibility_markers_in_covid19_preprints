Abstract
Through the enhanced connectivity of physical devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) brings improved
efficiency to the lives of consumers when on-the-go and in the home. However, it also introduces new
potential security threats and risks. These include threats that range from the direct hacking of devices
that could undermine the security, privacy and safety of its users, to the enslaving of IoT devices to
commit cybercrime at scale, such as Denial of Service attacks. The IoT is recognised as being widely
insecure, in large part, due to the lack of security features built into devices. Additionally, consumers
do not always actively use security features when available. More disconcerting is that we lack market
surveillance on whether manufacturers ship products with good security features or how the importance
of user-controlled security features is explained to IoT users. Our study seeks to address this gap. To
do this, we compiled a database of 270 consumer IoT devices produced by 220 different manufacturers
on sale at the time of the study. The user manuals and associated support pages for these devices were
then analysed to provide a “consumer eye” view of the security features they provide and the cyber
hygiene advice that is communicated to users. The security features identified were then mapped to the
UK Government's Secure by Design Code of Practice for IoT devices to examine the extent to which
devices currently on the market appear to conform to it. Our findings suggest that manufacturers provide
too little publicly-available information about the security features of their devices which makes market
surveillance challenging and provides consumers with little information about the security of devices
prior to their purchase. On average, there was discussion of around four security features, with account
management and software updates being the most frequently mentioned. Advice to consumers on cyber
hygiene was also rarely provided. Finally, we found a lack of standardisation in the communication of
security-related information for IoT devices among our sample. We argue for government intervention
in this space to provide assurances around device security, whether this provided in a centralised or
decentralised manner.

1. Introduction
The next wave of technological revolution is hyped to be the Internet of Things (IoT). These “things”
are internet connected devices that collect and share data over the Internet. This increased connectivity
can help to improve their functionality and efficiency but in doing so also generates new potential
threats and risks. Some of these devices represent new products (e.g. personal assistants) but many were
once everyday household items such as light bulbs, thermostats and door locks. To provide an example
of the risks these devices bring, consider that traditionally, protecting one’s home generally only
required adequate physical security measures. However, with the internet connectedness that the IoT
affords, protecting one’s home now involves a cyber element with risks that no longer rely on
geographical location. Amongst other things, threats to this cyber element can allow offenders to
circumvent the very conventional physical security measures that protect our homes – door locks,
windows and so on. IoT products can also interact with the home environment in new and innovative
ways, and actuators within the products can directly impact on critical services within the home, such
as heating systems. The disruption to such services can thus impact on human life and wellbeing [1]
and as such, the security of the IoT is paramount to protect consumer’s privacy, security and now
physical safety [2].
However, most consumer IoT devices that are sold on the market are not secure by design [3].
Manufacturers lack the capacity to support modern security controls and updates [4] and are not
sufficiently focused on security and privacy as a design priority [5]. In reality, security is left to the end
stages of product design and in some cases, left until the product is on the market [6]. This is an
unintended consequence of the “lean” and agile product development lifecycle that businesses choose
to adopt. This is perhaps not surprising as there is currently little (if any) economic incentive for
2

manufacturers to address security and there exists no regulation [2]. Consequently, as security is not
prioritised, we continue to see examples of how insecure IoT devices are. For example, a 2014 study
by HP found that 7 of the 10 most popular devices contained vulnerabilities associated with encryption
and password security [7]. An investigation by Which? found that 8 out of 15 tested devices, which
included Wi-Fi routers, children’s toys and CCTV cameras, had security vulnerabilities [8]. Through
vulnerability testing, academic research has also demonstrated that a number of security issues are
consistently found ([9], [10], [11], [12], [13]). This is the case even for large manufacturers who have
the competency and resources to design secure products [9]. Discerning the security of an IoT product
and communicating it in an accessible way is thus key to ensuring that consumers can make informed
decisions about the IoT products they buy.
Discerning the security of Information Communication Technology (ICT) products is difficult.
Discerning the security of IoT products is even more difficult, as doing so involves an assessment of
the security of the IoT device, its cloud services, its API and mobile applications [14]. IoT devices also
have differing capabilities [15], with some devices lacking memory and physical capacity for security.
Consequently, the IoT is seen as widely insecure [2] and this is in a large part due to the lack of security
features built into products [3]. Due to such vulnerabilities, we have already seen a number of cyberattacks that have successfully exploited consumer IoT devices. Default login credentials and a lack of
security updates are just some of the poor features that have been exploited at scale [16]. In response to
the growing threats, governments and industry security champions have started to try and push
manufacturers and the market toward better security.
In March 2018, the UK government outlined what they consider good security for consumer IoT
products [17]. Their secure by design Code of Practice (CoP) outlines 13 principles that manufacturers
should follow. They have also mapped the CoP onto existing standards and IoT security
recommendations [18] demonstrating that the CoP is a useful overarching framework for IoT security.
The CoP outlines the following security features that should be provided:

Alongside the DCMS CoP, there exist numerous IoT security best practice guides for manufacturers to
follow [19]. However, what is not currently understood is what proportion of IoT devices on the market
disclose the security features they offer to consumers. At present, only the findings of tests by security
researchers (e.g. [3]), consumer groups (e.g. [21]) and academic researchers (e.g. [12]) provide an
indication of the security posture of IoT devices and market engagement with security. While important,
such information provides only a partial picture. In this study, our primary aim was to identify what
security features are currently communicated about IoT devices and how they map onto the DCMS
Code of Practice. To do this, we focused on the information communicated by manufacturers in device
manuals and associated web pages (e.g. support pages, user forums). We chose to focus on these
communication mechanisms as i) it allowed us to scrutinise publicly available information about IoT
3

devices, ii) it allowed us to understand the challenges consumers face when buying IoT devices – since
security information is communicated to them through manuals and support pages1, iii) it provides a
cost-effective method to identify security features compared to testing IoT products in the lab, and iv)
it allowed us to sample a broader range of products than has been considered in previous research, by
examining the products sold by UK retailers and those listed on IoT online databases (e.g. iotlist.co).
Considering previous work that has examined the security of devices, the approach taken largely
focuses on assessing security for key areas such as the confidentiality of data, the integrity and
authentication of the IoT’s connection, access control and the availability of the device to connection
requests and, finally, the capability of the device to participate in reflective DDoS attacks [9]. Other
approaches focus on the presence of security features and the “vulnerability surface” of a device i.e.
features such as its interfaces, processing attack surface and systematic architecture that objectively
make the device less secure [22]. Adopting a similar approach to Jamieson [22], we focus on the
presence or absence of security features as a way to derive the security posture of a device as
communicated in manuals and support pages. This allowed us to examine the security of a device at a
lower cost than vulnerability testing individual IoT devices that other approaches require. A caveat, of
course, is that the absence of a discussion of particular security features in device publications does not
mean that those features are not present, just that they are not discussed in the materials that accompany
a device. In terms of objectively assessing the security of a device offers this is an important
methodological point. However, from the perspective of the consumer who wants to select a secure
device prior to purchase, or who wants to be reassured about the security a purchased device provides,
these are just semantics, since most consumers will not be able to conduct the highly technical
penetration tests required to assess the limits of a device’s security. Thus, the approach we take here
provides a “consumer eye” view of the security currently offered by devices.
A further challenge associated with consumer IoT is scalability, which makes market surveillance
difficult [23]. Consumer IoT is already ubiquitous, but if the hype of the IoT matches reality, the
majority of consumer goods will be internet connected in the future (up from 6.4 billion connected
“things” to 20.8 billion by 2020, [24]). In this context, it will not be feasible to require manufacturers
to go through independent penetration testing by third parties to obtain certification for all aspects of
security. Thus, while the monitoring of compliance is clearly needed – to ensure that consumers are
protected – the mechanism for doing this remains unclear. One suggestion is for the creation of a
centralized database that details the security features of devices and provides an ongoing assessment of
their security posture [23]. Presently, no such database exists and it is likely to be many years before
such a resource is available. The assessment of device manuals and support pages thus allowed us to
assess the current state of play concerning the disclosure of security features. As well as providing a
snapshot of how things are now, the exercise is intended to inform future market surveillance efforts.
The second aim of our study was to examine the provision of cyber hygiene advice from manufacturers.
That is, what information is provided by manufacturers to encourage consumers to protect their devices
and reduce their risk of cybercrime. Statistics consistently show that consumers do not always engage
in actions to protect themselves from cybersecurity threats. For example, only 52% regularly download
the latest software updates and only 32% follow the latest government password advice [25]. Moreover,
it is well known that the majority of cybersecurity breaches involve a human element [26] and so
encouraging cyber hygiene is key to helping protect consumers and their devices. In the case of the IoT,
this is even more challenging than it is for other ICT, as a number of the behaviours expected of
consumers are the result of poor design (such as hard-coded default passwords) [17] rather than the
result of consumer non-compliance. Research [27] has also shown that there are up to 43 security
1

Information may also be communicated through apps and other means during the setup phase of a device, but
consumers will not usually be able to access this information prior to purchasing a device. Moreover, the manuals
and associated materials will represent an important source of information for many consumers.
4

behaviours that consumers may have to engage in to protect their IoT devices from purchase (e.g.
researching a device’s security before purchasing), set-up (e.g. changing security and privacy settings)
and maintenance (e.g. updating devices) to ultimate disposal (e.g. securely wiping devices before
disposal). The burden for protecting devices is thus currently on consumers and manufacturers need to
reduce this through greater security by design. However, it is important to understand how well the
features are described to consumers in user documentation and what (if any) crime prevention
messaging is used to persuade consumers to follow them.
To summarise, in this study we coded a sample of consumer IoT devices manuals and product support
pages to provide a picture of the security features and cyber hygiene advice provided for different
internet connected devices. We seek to address the following three research questions:
RQ1: What security features are communicated in consumer IoT device manuals and support pages?
RQ2: How well do the identified security features map onto the DCMS Secure by Design Code of
Practice?
RQ3: What cyber hygiene advice is communicated to consumers?

2. Methodology
We compiled a database of consumer IoT devices from the website iotlist.co, and by extracting the
names of devices listed under the categories “smart home” or “Internet of Things” from the website of
a major UK retailer (PC World). We removed duplicate records and similar devices from the same
manufacturers (e.g. different versions of the same device), which resulted in a database of 423
individual devices. Of these, 153 were no longer sold or in development. The final database consisted
of 270 devices produced by 220 different manufacturers. While not important to the current work, this
attrition is worth noting as it provides a crude illustration of the fact that IoT products may disappear
from the market relatively quickly, which may create problems in the future if legacy devices and
systems are not updated to keep them secure.

Search strategy for manuals and associated support pages
To identify device security features, the first step was to identify if the device came with a user manual.
To locate the device manuals, we used Google’s search engine and the following terms:
“Device name” AND “manual” or “guide” or “quick start”
In addition to searching for the device manuals, we searched for associated online material published
by the manufacturer that might communicate details about the security of devices to consumers. Such
materials included support pages, user forums or frequently asked questions pages. We developed our
search strategy using terms found in the DCMS Code of Practice, as follows:
“Device name” AND “security” or “encryption” or “password” or “updates” or
“vulnerability disclosure”

Coding strategy
Two researchers independently read all of the materials identified and coded them using a “bottom-up”
approach. That is, they did not restrict the security features coded to those outlined in the DCMS code
of practice but rather coded any mention of device security features (as the DCMS code of practice may
not account for all security features). From these initial codes, a final coding scheme was derived –
based on recurring codes from the initial data set – using the principles of content analysis [28].
Together, the two researchers re-coded the security features to the final coding scheme and mapped this

5

to the DCMS code of practice. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and refinement of
the coding scheme.

3. Results
Types of products
Table 1 shows the types of products identified from the iotlist.co and UK retailer’s website, and the
number of manuals or associated materials identified for each. In total, details were available in
manuals and online pages for 42 devices, on online web pages only for 62 devices and in manuals alone
for 66 devices. In terms of the types of IoT devices covered, wearables were the most common (n=46),
followed by home security (n=35) and assistants (n=22). Below, we first discuss our findings in the
aggregate (i.e. for all devices) and then provide detail for specific types of devices.

Frequency of security features
The mean number of security features discussed2 in the materials analysed was 4.11 (SD=1.86, min=1,
max=9, n=170). Of the nine devices for which the most security features were discussed (at least 8
features), seven were produced by large manufacturers3, suggesting that larger manufacturers may
provide greater disclosure of the security features their devices ship with. These larger manufacturers
produced only 24% of the devices sampled and so this finding cannot simply be explained by their
domination of the devices coded (i.e. they did not produce 7/9 of devices examined). Considering the
security features discussed, user accounts were the most common (76.5%), followed by
software/firmware updates (62.4%) and factory resets (48.2%) (Table 2). However, updates and factory
resets were rarely actually framed around the discussion of security and in the majority of cases, were
instead discussed in relation to performance improvement.

DCMS Secure by Design Code of Practice (CoP)
Considering the DCMS CoP, we were able to derive information from manuals and related support
pages for 5 of the 13 principles. They are discussed here in order of prevalence.
CoP 3 “Keep software updated”
Updates were one of the most commonly referenced features (62.4%). However, in the majority of cases
(90%), the information provided did not explicitly mention security. Instead, updates were usually
discussed in the context of product functionality, with quotes such as those below being typical:
“Free feature enhancements and product improvements are occasionally made available
through firmware updates. We recommend keeping your <product name> up to date”
“Your <product name> device receives software updates automatically over an active Internet
connection. These updates usually improve performance and add new features.”
For only 10% of the devices examined was security explicitly mentioned as being a feature of the
updates provided. Where it was, example quotes from manuals/support pages include the following:
“Keep your beacons updated to enjoy all the new features which we add on a regular basis.
Each update also brings performance improvements and security tweaks so you'll always want
to have the latest firmware installed for the best experience.”

2

There were a possible total of 15 attributes – the need to change default passwords was excluded from this list because
advice to change them indicates that a device was shipped with a default password (which is an insecure practice).
3
These were Apple, Fitbit, NEST (2), Panasonic, Phillips, and Samsung.
6

“Keeping your watch up to date enhances its performance, improves apps' features, and adds
more security protection. If an update is available, you will be receive a system notification on
your watch. However, you can manually check for software updates.”
CoP 11“Make it easy for consumers to delete personal data”
48.2% of products described some form of factory reset that could be used to clear the data stored on
the device. However, for only 2.4% of devices was specific advice given to consumers on how to give
away or sell their product and the procedures they should undertake for wiping their personal
information. For the majority of devices, the discussion about factory resets was in relation to improving
the performance of the device, for example:
“In case something goes terribly wrong with your <product name>, you have the option to
perform a factory reset. Note that, when you do this, all your data and settings will be
wiped from your <product name>”
CoP 2 “Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy”
The materials provided for 32.4% of products detailed a vulnerability disclosure policy. This
information was normally published on the manufacturers’ website.
CoP 5 “Communicate securely”
Discussions about the security of data and its communication was discussed with reference to the
following: Wi-Fi encryption (20.0%), the encryption of data transmitted over the internet or other
channels (16.5%), encryption at rest but not on the device (15.3%), the security of cloud services (5.3%),
local communication encryption such as Bluetooth and Z-wave (4.7%) and local data storage on the
device (2.9%).
With respect to the specific types of Wi-Fi encryption used, this varied across the 34 products for which
it was discussed, but most devices were compatible with more than one standard and most used the
more secure WPA or WPA2 standards (Table 3). Details of other encryption standards used for IoT
devices included in this review are in Appendix A.
CoP 12 “Make installation and maintenance of devices easy”
This CoP makes reference to the need to provide “guidance on how to securely set up their device”. We
found that for 10.0% of the devices, consumers were provided with advice about how to secure their
IoT products.
CoP 1 “No default passwords”
According to the user manuals and associated materials, only 4.7% of the products sampled were
shipped with a default password. Of the remainder, 77.6% required the user to create login credentials
or a pin set up instead of using default passwords. This suggests that this insecure practice of having
default passwords may currently be in the minority.
Remaining CoP principles
From the information communicated to consumers, it was not possible to discern the extent to which
the following CoP principles were addressed: CoP 4 “Securely store credentials and security-sensitive
data”, CoP 6 “Minimise exposed attack surfaces”, CoP 7 “Ensure software integrity”, CoP 8 “Ensure
that personal data is protected”, CoP 9 “Make systems resilient to outages”, CoP 10 “Make systems
resilient to outages” and CoP 13 “Validate input data”.

Cyber hygiene and crime prevention advice
As discussed, our third overarching question concerned what advice is given to consumers about cyber
security. We found that for 10.0% of products, some kind of advice was provided. The majority of the
advice provided concerned password hygiene and how to create a “strong password” (3.5%), although
none of the advice was in line with the National Cyber Security Centre guidance on password creation.
Instead, consumers were encouraged to create short and complex passwords (random letters, numbers
and symbols). For example:
“… account password is secure enough to restrict access to your account. It should be at least
eight-character long, have mixed case, and use a combination of alphanumeric and special
characters”
The written materials provided for two products encouraged consumers to write their password down
in the manual. For our sample, the material associated with only 34 devices (or 20% of the 170 devices)
provided consumers with information about Wi-Fi security. Of these, the majority did not provide
specific recommendations about the encryption standard consumers should use. Table 4 shows the
number of devices for which Wi-Fi encryption was discussed, and where more than one standard was
provided, which was the preferred option.
For less than one per cent (1.2%) of products, there was a discussion of the need for consumers to install
updates for security reasons, despite software updates being discussed as a feature for 62.4% of
products. The materials reviewed for two products provided general guidance on how consumers could
protect themselves and their home in reference to cybercrime. For example:
“Q: How can I prevent a cybercriminal from making unauthorized changes to my
thermostat?
A: If a cybercriminal gains access to your Wi-Fi router, they can tamper with a wide range of
online activities, including the settings on your connected devices. Make sure you change the
default password on your Wi-Fi router, and when you select a new password, make sure it uses
multiple upper- and lower-case letters and special characters.”
Finally, 2.4% provided guidance on how to give away or sell a product whilst keeping data safe. For
example:
“For security purposes, if you give away or recycle your <product name>, make sure you first
remove any personal data. To erase your……”
None of the communications around cyber hygiene advice communicated the risks of non-compliance
to the consumer.

Type of product
Table 5 provides a breakdown of the security features discussed in user manuals and associated
materials by type of product. In looking at this, it is important to note that the sample size differs by
product. And, while we sampled devices listed on a major retailer’s website and Iotlist.co, our list of
devices is not exhaustive and it is possible that our sample is not representative of the population of
devices in use today. As such, we suggest that the data are interpreted cautiously. However, there are
a number of trends worth noting. First, for our sample, home entry and smart health devices appeared
to provide more cyber hygiene advice in their manuals than was the case for other products. Second,
and somewhat expected, devices with a direct interface on the product provided a product lock function
(e.g. smart TVs). Third, smart entry products had the highest frequency of permission settings. Finally,
the bad practice of shipping with default passwords or PINs was highest for Smart TVs.

4. Discussion
The current study aimed to (i) identify what security features are communicated to consumers in device
manuals and support pages, (ii) to explore the extent to which these features can be mapped onto the
DCMS Secure by Design CoP, and (iii) to identify what cyber hygiene advice is communicated to
consumers. Our review suggests that manufacturers are not providing enough information to consumers
about the security features of their devices. On average, there was discussion of around four security
features, with account management and software updates being the most frequently mentioned. Despite
these features being important for security, they were rarely spoken about in relation to security.
Instead, they were largely discussed in terms of product use and maintenance, or product functionality.
The DCMS Secure by Design CoP outlines what “good” security of a consumer IoT product looks like.
We found that we were able to discern information for only 5 of the 13 principles. DCMS prioritise the
top three principles (CoP 1 “No default passwords”, CoP 2 “Implement a vulnerability disclosure
policy”, and CoP 3 “Keep software updated”) as they represent the key issues that the market needs to
address immediately. We were able to derive information for all three of these key principles. For the
use of default passwords, we found that – according to the material reviewed – around 4.7% of devices
followed this poor practice suggesting that its prevalence in the market is not that widespread, although
it is a major contributing factor in IoT botnets [29]. For vulnerability disclosure policies, only 32.4% of
the sampled products had one in place. These policies are important for the security community as it
allows responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities to manufacturers. In their absence, it can mean
that (discovered) vulnerabilities of IoT devices do not get fixed. Finally, for software updates, we found
that for 62.4% of products, updates were discussed. However, security was discussed in only 10% of
cases. Moreover, across all of the products sampled, there was no indication of how long security
updates would be provided. Since this can vary across products, and is critical to their ongoing security,
it is important that this information is communicated to consumers at (or prior to) the point of purchase.
At present, it would appear that it is not. In short, for the devices sampled, DCMS CoP 3 was rarely
addressed.
The remaining principles from the CoP were more difficult to discern as they related to storage of
credentials (CoP 4), attack surfaces (CoP 6), software integrity (CoP 7), system resilience (CoP 9), the
monitoring of system telemetry data (CoP 10) and the validation of data input (CoP 13). It would be
unlikely for a manufacturer to disclose this information to consumers as it is not related to the
maintenance of products, and so would not be obvious information to disclose in device manuals at
present. Furthermore, some of this information is highly technical and so would be understood by a
minority of consumers.
Perhaps most concerning is the fact that cyberhygiene advice was rarely provided to consumers, with
guidance being provided for only 10% of products for which manuals or associated materials were
available. In line with this, existing research has shown that the general public mainly learn about
security via device prompts when they are forced to take action by a device, or through advice from
family/friends [30]. In a further study, Redmiles et al. [31] assessed the readability of security advice
provided in 1,878 documents concerning online behaviour drawn from sources including help pages,
polices and the media. They found that in only 25 cases was the advice provided written to an
adequately comprehensible standard. It is worth noting that they did not assess the extent to which the
information followed the latest government guidance and hence their findings may have been
optimistic. Here, we focussed on manuals as a source of advice and found that it was rarely given and
where it was, it was not typically in line with the kind of people-centric advice provided by the National
Cyber Security Centre [32]. Furthermore, the kinds of behaviour change techniques that are necessary
to encourage cyberhygiene – such as providing information about consequences [33] – were not
employed in any of the manuals. It is well known that certain techniques (such as communications
versus training) are associated with greater effectiveness and for the specific psychological constructs
9

they seek to target (e.g. risk reception) ([34], [35]). However, in the context of the IoT, further work is
needed to identify the optimal behaviour change techniques for manual/support pages communications
to encourage cyberhygiene behaviour, and there is a need to use a systematic approach to behaviour
change intervention design [36].
At present, a consumer cannot discern the security of one device over another, which is particularly
problematic during purchasing. In the absence of regulation or a labelling scheme on products,
consumers have to research a product before purchasing [36]. We have shown in this study that even
if a consumer wanted to do such research (and if they have the technical capability to undertake it), the
information is not provided to them by manufacturers. Instead, there is an information asymmetry.
Consumers are therefore at a disadvantage when protecting themselves in the context of the IoT. A
labelling scheme is one mechanism that could be used to communicate a device’s security posture to
consumers, and other work conducted as part of the PETRAS Consumer Security Index project (see
[37]) is exploring this. Another potential mechanism is for the information to be disclosed in a
centralised database that has both consumer and government facing parts [23]. With respect to the
information asymmetry, DCMS have recently stated that they cannot give advice to consumers about
purchasing IoT devices as little information is provided about the security features of devices, whether
updates are provided, and if the product warranty includes the update period [38]. Our findings support
DCMS’s concern and support the need for a labelling scheme to reduce this information asymmetry in
security that prevents consumers from buying secure products [37].
Overall, we found that there is a lack of standardisation in the communication of security-related
information for IoT devices. There are no industry standards for manufacturers and the information that
is currently presented in manuals and other materials depends on the manufacturer’s due diligence rather
than a common standard. Compare this to energy efficiency, for which manufacturers must specify an
energy efficiency performance table in brochures and associated documents, and make the technical
documentation available to the UK Office for Product Safety and Standards, if requested [39]. Similar
standardization for the communication of IoT device security is needed to help consumers and market
surveillance authorities discern the security of devices – whether this is to be disclosed in manuals, in a
centralised database, or in some other way. If standardised information were disclosed in device
manuals, this could be made machine readable so that information could be collated by third parties and
simplified in a way that is accessible to consumers. However, this would need to be reported in a
relatively standardised way to facilitate its reliable extraction.

5. Limitations
There are a number of limitations with the current study. Firstly, we derived our sample from a database
of IoT products and from a major UK retailer. As such, the sample largely represents products from
well-known manufacturers and may not be representative of the market of consumer IoT devices,
particularly those cheaper devices sold on sites such as eBay, for example.
Secondly, due to budget constraints, we could not analyse the software applications (“apps”) for each
of the devices. Information about security features may be communicated within the app of the device
but it was not possible to test this. However, the benefit of the current study is that it assesses publicly
available information which is representative of what is accessible to consumers prior to purchase –
what we described above as the “consumer eye view”.
Thirdly, assessing the implementation of security features through vulnerability testing was beyond the
scope of this report but is an integral aspect of IoT security that we do not wish to underrepresent. This
study demonstrates what information can be derived from device user manuals and support pages to
give an indication of a device’s security posture, but it is not the last word.

10

6. Conclusion
The manuals and support pages of consumer IoT devices do not provide adequate information about
device security features. Of those that disclosed features, we were able to derive information on the top
three principles from the DCMS code of practice. Cyberhygiene advice is rarely provided in manuals,
despite the importance it can play in preventing cybercrime. We suggest that what is communicated in
manuals should be standardised and that, as suggested by Kleinhans [23], security information should
be stored in a centralised repository. Doing so would aid market surveillance and perhaps more
importantly, allow device security to be summarised in a more accessible format for consumers (e.g.
through a labelling scheme) to aid their purchasing choices.

Appendix A1: Glossary of terms
Abbreviation

Term

Definition

2FA

Two factor
authentication

A method for authenticating a users' identity using two different
factors. These can include something they know (e.g. a password), a
physical possession (e.g. a USB key or bank card), or factors
associated with the user (e.g. biometrics). App generated codes are
another example.

AES

Advanced
Encryption Standard

Is a cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt or secure data. It uses a
symmetric-key block cipher algorithm (which can be used encrypt
and decrypt data) and has cryptographic key sizes of 128, 192 and
256 bits. The larger the bit size, the more secure the data.

API

Application
Programming
Interface

A set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools
for building software applications (including websites) that interact
with one another.

DDoS

Distributed Denial
of Service

A method of cyber-attack for which the perpetrator seeks to make a
targeted machine or network resource unavailable by flooding (or
overwhelming) it with traffic from many different sources.

Digital
Certificate

FHSS

An electronic document, signed by a certificate authority, which
verifies the identity of an individual, an entity, or a company owning
the website/app on the Internet.
Frequency-hopping
Spread Spectrum

Hard-coded
password

A method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching a carrier
among many frequency channels, using a pseudorandom sequence
known to both the transmitter and receiver. The aim is to make the
signal resistant to interception.
A practice of embedding a password directly into the source code of
a program or other executable object, making it permanent.

HMAC

Bash-based
Message
Authentication Code

A method used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and
the authentication of a message sent between two systems.

HTTP

Hyper Text Transfer
Protocol

Hypertext Transfer Protocol for communication over a
communication network without encryption.

HTTPS

PKI

Hyper Text Transfer
Protocol Secure
Public Key
Infrastructure

An extension of HTTP for secure communication over a computer
network. HTTPS uses SSL or TLS to encrypt the data.
With PKI, a public key is used to encrypt data and a private key is
used to decrypt it.

SSL

Secured Sockets
Layer

A standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link
between two systems (typically a server and a client).

TLS

Transport Layer
Security

An updated and more secure version of SSL.

WAC

Wireless Accessory
Configuration

Apple's licensed technology designed for accessories that connect to
iPod, iPhone and iPad without requiring the user to type in the
network name and password.

WEP

Wired Equivalent
Privacy

An early generation of security protocols for protecting wireless
communication.

17

Abbreviation

Term

Definition

WPA

Wi-Fi Protected
Access

A security protocol for protecting secure wireless communication.
WPA was introduced after WEP and is more secure.

WPA2

Wi-Fi Protected
Access II

A security protocol for protecting secure wireless communication.
WPA2 was introduced after WPA and is more secure as it uses more
advanced encryption.

WPS

Wi-Fi Protected
Setup

A network security standard to create a secure wireless home
network. It is considered less secure than newer standards such as
WPA and WPA2.

Z-Wave

A wireless communication protocol, using low-energy radio waves
for home automation. It allows home appliances such as IoT devices
to communicate with each other.
