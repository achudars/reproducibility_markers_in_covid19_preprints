Market Orientation for Better Accountability of Government-Linked
Companies
Abstract
This study assesses the status of the current level of market orientation among the
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. This study collected primary data based
on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia.
The data were collected based on opinions of the ten factors of market orientation practices
by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. On an
average, 86.6% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of market
orientation. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on market orientation than the
state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of market orientation of
GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on providing close attention to after-sales service,
responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions, regularly discussing the competitors’
strengths and strategies by top management, and freely communicating successful and
unsuccessful customer experiences across all business functions. It is suggested that
Malaysian GLCs should serious invest in market orientation to deliver higher accountability
outcomes.
Key Words: market orientation, accountability, government-linked companies, sustainable

1. Introduction
In Malaysia the government owns at least twenty percent of paid up capital in the
Government Linked Companies (GLCs). Therefore it is expected that GLCs are actively
involved in market orientation to ensure better accountability. Market orientation can bring
many advantages, as it is a powerful source for the organization to achieve superior
performance and create value for the organization (Gupta & Benson, 2011). According to
Barney (1991), organizations could create competitive advantages by obtaining valuable,
rare, inimitable resources, and capabilities. Obtaining such resources will lead to value
creation and sustainability in the organization. Kraaijenbrink & Spender (2011) also state that
without value creation, the organization would have no added value and thus, there would be
no reason for the organization to exist in the market. Value creation can improve the
performance of the organization by maximizing earnings per share, ensure high levels of
operational effectiveness, and remain competitive (Gholami, 2011). This will indirectly help
the organization to implement strategies to improve their efficiency and competitiveness
(Porter, 1997). However, there is no guarantee that all of the resources will lead to
competitive advantage or value creation. This is because, according to Kraaijenbrink and
Spender (2011), people may perceive values differently.
In order to ensure the sustainability of some government agencies, the government of
Malaysia decided to privatize the companies, which led to the formation of the GovernmentLinked Companies (GLCs). GLCs are defined as companies that achieve the primary
commercial objective of the Malaysian government (Khazanah, 2014) and the Malaysian
government has a direct controlling stake in these companies (OECD, 2013). The controlling
stake refers not only to the percentage of their ownership, but also their direct or indirect
influence in the appointment of directors and senior management officers. They also make

major decisions such as contracting awards, strategizing, restructuring, financing, and
acquisition and divestments through Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs).
However, past studies still show that GLCs lack value creation compared to non-GLCs
(Entebang, 2010; Razak et al., 2011). Muslim, Hafiz, and Fekri Ali (2012) state that GLCs
have suffered from recurring poor firm performances due to the lack of value creation in their
organization, which has made them come under the government’s scrutiny. Razak et al.
(2011) find that non-GLCs’ performances are better than GLCs in terms of their corporate
governance and other forms of specific characteristics, which makes them create more value
than GLCs. This is because GLCs do not focus too much on maximizing profits, as they are
also concerned about contributing towards nation building (Lau & Tong, 2008).
Several GLCs are unable to create value and thus suffer from poor performances such
as the Malaysian Airline System (MAS) and Proton Holding Berhad. Hence, GLCs need to
put in extra initiatives to create value so that they will be able to meet the requirements and
expectations of the government and at the same time, be able to increase and add value to
their products, services, and business performance (Lawler & Mohrman, 2013). Khazanah
(2014) states that GLCs are expected to improve and enhance their value creation by focusing
on sustainable practices and execution from 2015 onwards. Currently, GLCs, especially the
G201 companies, have started to focus on sustainable practices to achieve long-term value
creation. However, some GLCs tend to undermine the importance of sustainable practices as
they have several goals to accomplish. Moreover, there are currently limited researches done
on value creation in Malaysian GLCs (Lau & Tong, 2008). Under this circumstance, this
study investigates the practices of sustainable competitive advantage strategies among
different categories of Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. Market
orientation is one of the ways for organizations to enhance their value creation and obtain
competitive advantage (Arumugam, Guptan, & Sganmugam, 2011).
Companies, especially GLCs, can also be sustained by understanding their market and
environment (Fang et al., 2014). Market orientation is important to GLCs, as it will reflect the
companies’ actions towards the satisfaction of customers, competitors, and others (Boso,
Story, & Cadogan, 2013). This will enable the organization to attract and retain new and
existing customers. Fang et al. (2014) propose that organizations need to have sufficient
resources and market knowledge in order to sustain in the market. Thus, by gaining sufficient
knowledge of the market, GLCs will be able to create value, as they will be able to act
rationally towards any changes in the market. Therefore, this study investigates the practices
of market orientation as a strategy of sustainable competitive advantage among different
categories of Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia.
2. Methodology
2.1 Sampling and Data Collection
The data for this study are collected based on a questionnaire survey among 134 executives
and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The survey was conducted between February and April
of 2015.
2.2 Measurements of Variables
1

G20 is the selection of large GLCs, which are controlled by GLICs under the GLCT Programme and is used as
a proxy for performance of the GLCs. However, the G20 currently consists of only 17GLCs due to mergers,
demergers, divestments, and other corporate exercises over the years.

This study uses ten parameters to measure the practices of market orientation adopted from
McLaughlin (2002). Market orientation is measured based on its behavioral components,
which include customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-functional coordination.
The respondents are asked to compare all the practices of innovation in their organization
against their competitors in the same industry for at least three years. The questionnaire uses
a five-point Likert rating scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
3. Analysis and Finding
The study measures the practices of market orientation in GLCs using ten variables. Among
the respondents, on an average, 86.6% agree that they exercise these factors of market
orientation and 1.5% mention that they do not practise them (Table 2).

Among all the factors of market orientation, the highest mean score is 4.2 for the
factor of business driven beliefs on how to create greater value for customers (O3), and the
lowest mean score is 3.88 for the factor of free communication about successful and
unsuccessful customer experiences across all business functions (O9) (Table 2). The average
mean value is 4.1. There is scope to improve the overall market orientation by emphasizing
the factors that are far below the average score such as providing close attention to after-sales
service (O4), responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions (O5), regularly
discussing competitors’ strengths and strategies by top management (O6), and free
communication about successful and unsuccessful customer experiences across all business
functions (O9).

Overall, the federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on the factors of market
orientation than the state owned GLCs (Table 3). Among the factors of market orientation,
the state owned GLCs emphasize the most on the strategy for competitive advantage based on
understanding customer needs (O2) and emphasize the least on free communication about
successful and unsuccessful customer experiences across all business functions (O9). On the
other hand, the federal owned GLCs place the most emphasis on the factor of business driven
beliefs on how to create greater value for customers (O3) and the least emphasis on the factor
of responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions (O5).
The GLCs engaged in the service sector are more focused on organizational learning than
other sectors (Table 3). These service sector GLCs emphasize the most on monitoring the
level of commitment and orientation in serving the customers’ needs (O1) and emphasize the
least on the factor of responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions (O5), and free
communication about successful and unsuccessful customer experiences across all business
functions (O9). The GLCs engaged in the manufacturing sector place the most emphasis on
the factor of business driven beliefs on how to create greater value for customers (O3) and the
least emphasis on the factor of responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions (O5)
and on integrating all business functions in serving the needs of target markets (O7).
4. Conclusion and Recommendation
This study measured the status of the current practices of market orientation among different
categories of GLCs in Malaysia by assessing ten related factors. The factor analysis provided
the consistency of these ten variables for market orientation measurement. 86.6% of the
respondents admitted to exercising these ten factors of market orientation, and their average
score was 4.1 out of a 5 scale. Therefore, there is scope for improving the practices of market
orientation by the GLCs. Hence, the GLCs need to put in extra initiatives to create value so
that they will be able to meet the requirements and expectations of the government and at the
same time, be able to increase and add value to their products, services and business
performance (Lawler and Mohrman, 2013). Overall, GLCs should emphasize on paying close
attention to after-sales service, responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions,
regularly discuss the competitors’ strengths and strategies by the top management, and freely
communicate the successful and unsuccessful customer experiences across all business
functions. However, the state owned or federal owned GLCs and GLCs engaged in the
manufacturing or service sector should emphasize more on market orientation to exhibit
higher level accountability.
