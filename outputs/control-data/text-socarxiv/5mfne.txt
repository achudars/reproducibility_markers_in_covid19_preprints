"5" "ABSTRACT"
"6" "Analyses of the recent surge in racial wealth inequality have tended to focus on changes in asset holdings. Debt patterns, by contrast, have remained relatively unexplored. Using 2001-2013 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), we show that after peaking in 2007, debt levels for most debt types had returned to pre-financial crisis levels for blacks and whites by 2013. The primary exception to this is education debt, on which this paper focuses. We show that educational debt has increased substantially for blacks relative to whites in the past decade. We also show that this increase in debt is not attributable to differences in educational attainment across racial groups. These trends, we argue, reflect a process of  predatory inclusion , where lenders and financial actors offer needed services to black households, but on exploitative terms that limit or eliminate their long-term benefits.  Predatory inclusion, we propose, is one of the mechanisms behind the persistence of racial inequality in contemporary markets."
"7" "R acial  disparities in  wealth  have  increased sharply since the start of the  Great Recession  (Pfeffer, Danziger, and Schoeni 2013) .  E xplan ations for  this increase  have focused primarily  on  blacks’ disproportionate  housing asset   loss es. W ealth  levels   are a function of both household assets  and  household debt .  Racial disparities in debt burdens , however,  have received relatively little attention in  the sociological literature . In this  article , we contribute to the study of racial economic inequality by examining trends in household debt accumulation since 2000. We focus specifically on the recent emergence of a dramatic racial disparity in one specific type of debt: education debt. Educational debt accumulation, we argue, is a racialized process. Historical and  contemporary  patterns of racial inequality in the United States lead black households to accumulate larger amounts of student debt relative to white households , with little gains  in  terms of  educational attainment for blacks. We propose the concept of  predatory inclusion   as a framework for understanding this disparity."
"8" "Predatory Inclusion: Race and Debt in the United States"
"9" "Predatory inclusion  refers to a process whereby members of a marginalized group are provided with access to a good, service, or opportunity from which they have  historically been excluded  but under conditions that jeopardize the benefits of this access.  Indeed, p rocesses of predatory inclusion are often presented as providing marginalized individuals with opportunities for social and economic progress. In the long term, however, predatory inclusion reproduces marg inalization for these groups while allowing  already-dominant social actors to derive significant profits."
"10" "Recent developments in the mortgage lending industry provide a clear example of predatory inclusion  (Squires and Hyra 2010;  Williams, Nesiba and McConnell 2005;  Wyly et al. 2009) .  Until the 1950s, blacks were essentially excluded from mortgage lending  (Cohen 2003; Freund 2007)  and have since continued to experience barriers to access  (Bradford 1979; Wyly and Holloway 1999) . In the 1990s, an emerging subprime lending sector started providing underserved black and Latino households with new opportunities for financing homeownership. Subprime mortgages, however, entailed much worse lending conditions than those prevailing in the traditional sector  (Faber 2013; Rugh, Albright, and Massey 2015) . These conditions contributed to waves of home foreclosures and ultimately jeopardized homeownership’s value as a means of wealth accumulation for black and Latino borrowers  (Rugh and Massey 2010; Squires and Hyra 2010) ."
"11" "Predatory inclusion is, in our view, hardly unique to housing markets. S imilar dynamics have emerged  within the context of  higher education in the form of large and rac ially  patterned increases in student borrowing. College education—like homeownership—is an important tool of economic mobility in the United States  (Hout 2012; Torche 2011) , especially in the context of credential inflation  (Collins 1979; Cottom 2017) . Yet, much like homeownership, obtaining a college education can be prohibitively expensive for individuals  for those with   limited  economic resources  to begin with . This has been especially true in recent years given the  nearly 40 percent  increase in tuition costs since 1990  (Kena et al. 2015) . These growing costs have encouraged many students to rely on debt as a means of financing their education. Whether student debt is a productive investment, however, remains heavily debated."
"12" "To understand the  potential consequences of taking on student debt, it is essential in our view to consider its racial implications. As systematic and institutionalized racial inequalities tracerse nearly all social domains (Bonilla-Silva 1997; Reskin 2012), it should perhaps come as no surprise that student debt and the terms of that debt likely entail greater financial obstacles and hardships for black than for white borrowers. Because of lower  average  income and wealth  levels, black borrowers likely have to take on greater absolute and relative debt levels than their white counterparts  ( Hamilton et al 2015 ;  Oliver and Shapiro 2006). Risk-based pricing by  private lenders also means that blacks are likely offered poorer loan terms than whites on average  (Fourcade and Heal y 2013; Loonin and Cohen 2008 ) ."
"13" "Returns to college education are also lower for blacks. Compared with whites, black  college  students have a lower completion rate  (Huelsman 2015) ,  and ,  even a mong  college graduates, have lower earnings  (Zhang 2008)  and a higher unemployment rate  (Jones and Schmitt 2014) . Because of these disparities, similar amounts of student debt likely represent a greater financial risk and yield lower lifetime benefits for blacks. Student loans, in other words, may allow an increasing number of black students to pursue a college education,  but available evidence suggests that this occurs in a context where differential returns yield much lower returns than those experienced by whites."
"14" "We tackle these issues below by estimating overall debt and education debt holding for black and white households while also briefly considering whether increased educational attainment for black households accounts for the disproportionate increase in black student debt. We then propose potential alternative explanations for these patterns—explanations that we hope will offer important guideposts for future scholarship on this important and contemporary issue ."
"15" "Debt Trends for Black and White Households, 2001-2013"
"16" "Data and Methods"
"17" "Our estimates of household debt are calculated using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), arguably the most complete survey of household finances in the United States. SCF data are collected at the household level. This provides a significant advantage for studying student debt holding in the overall population because it  capture s  older debt holders    (approximately one third of student debt hol ders are at least 40 years old;  Brown et al. 2012)  and  debt taken on by students’ kin  (approx imately 17 percent  of parents ta ke out loans for their children;  Austin 2013) . All household debt measures are taken from the SCF Summary Extract Public Data and include all outstanding loans as well as all loans under deferment. All dollar amounts are reported in constant 2013 dollars."
"18" "SCF data are  collected through a dual-sample de sign combining a standard multi stage area-probability design and an oversample of households expected to have higher than average wealth. To insure national representativeness, all descriptive statistics are adjusted using SCF-provided sampling weights. Missing data are imputed prior to public release. We therefore report linearized standard errors that adjust for multiple imputations. All estimates were obtained using multiple imputation and survey data estimation commands in Stata 14  (StataCorp 2015) .  Race in our analyses refers to the self-reported race of the head of household, defined in the SCF as the male partner in mixed-sex couples or the older partner in same-sex couples."
"19" "Debt Patterns"
"20" "Figure 1 shows  household debt trends between 2001 and 2013. Using 2001 as a reference point , one sees  that household debt increased steadily prior to the financial crisis for most major debt types. This increase likely reflects greater credit availability and was accompanied by a similar increase in average household assets. After 2007, however, debt holdings shrank for most debt types and ,  in some cases—credit card and vehicle debt—returned to 2001 levels. Fluctuation in access to debt was especially notable for black households. F or  example ,  average  mortgage debt  for black households  was almost 200 percent  higher in 2007 relative to 2001 (from about $29,000 to   about $57,000). By 2013, however, black households’ average mortgage debt had fallen back to about $34,000— a 40 percent  drop from the 2007 peak.  By contrast, average mortgage debt for white households only increased by 40  percent  between 2001 and 2007 (from about $60,000 to about $84,000) and has fallen by only  about 10 percent  since (reaching approximately $75,000 in 2013)."
"21" "The major exception  to the  overall pattern  just discussed  is student debt.  In contrast to generally falling debt levels after 2007, average household education debt continued to expand after the financial crisis, reaching more than 2.5 times its 2001 level by 2013. Like mortgage debt, patterns of educational debt vary considerably by race. As Figure 2 shows, educational debt was similar across racial groups until 2007 but has intensified more rapidly for black compared with white  households .  Black educational debt roughly tripled between 2001 and 2013, growing from $2,422 to $7,531 on average. As a result, black households had significantly higher student debt levels than white households in 2010 (about $2,000 more,  p   < 0.05) and 2013 (about $1,800,  p   < 0.05). This disparity is especially striking given that blacks have lower debt levels than whites for all other debt types  (see Chiteji 2007 for similar findings in a younger sample) ."
"22" "This overall increase in average black educational debt over the period reflects an increase in the number of black debt holders. As Figure 3 shows, the proportion of black households taking on educational debt more than doubled between 2001 and 2013. Almost one in three  black households (32 percent ) held education debt in 2013, compared to less than one in fi ve (18 percent ) white households. Average education debt for black households reporting  non zero student debt ($15,000 in 2001, $23,000 in 2013) remains lower than average debt for white households  with non zero student debt ($18,500 in 2001, $31,000 in 2013).   Yet student debt represents a greater share of black households’ debt burden compared with white households. As Figure 4 shows, educational debt now represents appro ximately 20 percent  of black households’ total debt, compared to only  6 percent  in 2001 . By contrast, whites’ education debt only  increased from 4  to  8 percent  of their total debt burden."
"23" "Changes in Educational Attainment as a Potential Explanation"
"24" "The most obvious explanation for an increase in student debt for blacks would be a proportional increase in the number of black students pursuing postsecondary degrees. Enrollment at two- and four-year institutions increased at a faster rate for blacks than for whites between 2000 and 2014 (Snyder, de Brey, and Dillow 2016). Increases in enrollment have been particularly large for older black students, with those above 35 years of age now twice as likely as whites of the same age to be enrolled (Kena et al. 2015). College enrollment is not measured in the SCF, but we can offer a preliminary test by examining the impact of changes in educational attainment for black and white households since 2000 on expected racial disparities in student debt."
"25" "We do this by estimating  a  generalized  linear model  (GLM)  of the following form:"
"26" "where  Education  is a categorical variable measuring educational attainment of the head of household (less than high school, high school, some college, college degree),  Year  is a categorical variable indicating SCF survey year ,     is a vector of control variables,  and   is a normally distributed random error.  We obtain unique yearly estimates of the racial gaps in student debt by interacting the  Black  and the  Year  variables. The model controls for household  Income ,  Assets  (financial and non-financial),  Size  ( the number of people in the household ), and  Composition  (single with children, single without children and head of household under 55, single without children and head of household over 55, married or partnered with children, married or partnered without children) ."
"27" "Models are estimated using an iterated reweighted least-squares (IRLS) method. Standard errors are adjusted to  account  for  the SCF’ s multiple imputation procedure .  Note that because our model controls for assets, we do not adjust regression estimates using sampling weights. Using survey weights in this context could lead to biased coefficient estimates and inefficient standard errors  (Winship and Radbill 1994) ."
"28" "Figure 5 shows predicted racial gaps in student debt from our GLM model. Gaps are computed by holding all control variables constant at their mean. A positive number indicates that blacks had greater student debt than whites for that year. We present results from two model specifications. The first model (“baseline”) provides estimates from a model that includes all control variables, but excludes the  Education  variable. The second model (“full”) adds the  Education  variable. In effect, the full model provides estimates of racial gaps in student debt had educational attainment for blacks and whites been the same and constant across the whole period. Shaded areas show confidence intervals, with the darker ribbon indicating overlap."
"29" "Our findings  suggest that educational attainment and household socioeconomic characteristics do not account for racial gaps in student debts in any of the years considered. For all years, estimated racial gaps from the full model are not significantly different (at the 0.05 level) from the estimated racial gaps from the baseline model. Logistic regression models predicting whether households have any student debt and generalized linear models predicting student debt as a proportion of total debt (not shown) yield substantively similar results. Overall, these models suggest two conclusions. First, racial differences in income, assets, and family structure do not explain blacks’ greater reliance on student loans. Second, changes in educational attainment for black and white households between 2000 and 2013 do not explain racial gaps in student debt or their increase over time.  Although hardly a definitive evaluation of the role of student enrollment, the patterns reported do offer evidence that increases in debt are likely not attributable to increased educational credentials for black households."
"30" "Other Potential Explanations"
"31" "Our estimates reported thus far indicate that black households are now carrying more student debt and that obvious individual-level explanations—that is, racial disparities in socioeconomic status or educational attainment—fail to fully explain this trend. We propose instead that growing racial inequalities in student debt are perhaps better understood as a consequence of changing opportunities and constraints in lending  particular ly  warrant much more   attention in our view: the growth of the for-profit sector in postsecondary education and the increased role of private lenders  in the educational loan market."
"32" "The for-profit sector in higher education is one potential cause of black households’ growing student debt levels. Attendance at for-profit degree-granting institutions increased almost tenfold between 1995 and 2010, from 240,000 to 2,018,000 enrolled students  (Gallup 2015) ,  while enrollment in nonprofit higher education insti tutions remained largely stable . For-profit colleges and universities impose higher costs on students than similar public institutions  (Snyder, de Brey, and Dillow 2016) , and i mportantly, enrollment at for-profit institutions is racially patterned. In 2012, for-profits captured 11 percent of white undergraduate students, compared with 21 percent of black undergraduates  (estimates obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics’ [NCES] online data retrieval tool, Datalab).  Older undergraduate students (24 and older)—who are disproportionately non-white—are also overrepresented in for-profit schools (NCES Datalab). These institutions also tend to disproportionately enroll groups with dedicated federal education benefits. In 2009-2010, for example, for-profit institutions took in approximately a fifth of all Pell Grants for low-income students  (Goldrick-Rab 2016) , which were used by about 60  percent  of black students in 2011  (Ifill and Hufford 2015) . For-profits also captured $1.7 billion in GI benefits in 2012-13 alone (Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee 2012)."
"33" "Attendance at a for-profit institution is associated with a greater likelihood of taking on student debt. In 2012, almost 90% of students at for-profit private colleges carried debt, compared to around 65% at other four-year schools  (U.S. Department of Education) .   A 2012 government report found that graduates of for-profits finished with median debt of $32,700 ,  compared to $24,600 for private non-profits  (Avery and Turner 2012) . Almost 40 percent  of students at for-profit institutions in 1995 had defaulted on schoo l loans by 2010, compared to 20 percent  of non-profit attendees  (Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee 2012) ."
"34" "Growth in private student lending  over this period may also have played a role in greater black indebtedness.   Private loans tend to be more costly and to offer few of the protections associated with federal student loans  (TICAS 2016) . Private borrowing nearly tripled between 2003 and 2007 (CFPB 2012). Private borrowing had receded significantly  by 2012 (down to 6  percent  of all undergraduates), but  remained at levels higher than before the financial crisis  (Looney and Yannelis 2015; TICAS 2016) ."
"35" "Important relative to the points above is the fact that  b lack students disproportionately attend educational institutions that provide insufficient information on federal loan   eligibility, leaving them more vulnerable to private lenders  (TICAS 2016) .  The private sector in educational lending may in fact be developing aggressive and risky lending tactics similar to those seen in mortgage lending at the height of the subprime bubble. Indeed, this is where we suspect a significant part of the inequality-generating action is. For this reason, we hope that future work will carefully assess the role of for-profit institutions and private loans as core drivers of the growing racial inequalities and the intensifying indebtedness that black students and their families face."
"36" "DISCUSSION"
"37" "Debt can have a positive impact on households’ long-term financial wellbeing   and is often understood as a sign of market incorporation and access to financial tools  (Killewald 2013) . The long term benefits of debt and credit, however, are likely not equal across groups. Like other scholars who identify exploitative “fringe” practices in mainstream financial institutions  (Faber 2013)  and argue that market incorporation can actually exacerbate group-based economic disparities  (Negro, Visentin, and Swaminathan 2014) , we  suggest that predatory inclusion remains an important cause of contemporary racial inequality.  Growing racial disparities in wealth and economic standing, we believe, are not exclusively an effect of past inequality reproduced through intergenerational  transfers . They reflect contemporary institutional practices—like predatory inclusion—that need to be carefully studied."
"38" "We  proposed  at the outset  that growing racial disparities in student debt reflect a new and still-ongoing example of predatory inclusion. Student borrowing allows otherwise-excluded households to finance a college education. Large amounts of student debt, however, impose  significant  financial risks on these households.  This is especially true for blacks, who have more precarious economic positions overall, lower average returns to college enrollment, greater enrollment at for-profit educational institutions, and rely more on private student loans. These factors mean that for black households, growing student debt burdens could likely reduce or even eliminate the hoped-for financial stability a college degree is traditionally seen as providing."
"39" "The consequences of growing disparities in student debt for racial inequality are not yet clear but may be profound. Unlike homeowners, students cannot foreclose on their degrees and have their debt liabilities wiped clean. Moreover, and unlike the most recent predatory inclusion episode—spawned by the development of subprime mortgage lending—student debt levels are unlikely to recede significantly. 3  Student debt is legally very difficult to discharge, even when declaring bankruptcy ( Austin 2013 ;  Pottow 2006 ). Defaulting on student loans also does not prevent the government from garnishing borrowers’ wages, taxes, and other benefits ( TICAS 2016 ). Although families carrying student debt may be less likely to lose their lifetime savings overnight—as happened in the foreclosure crisis—households will potentially be permanently saddled with debt repayment obligations that divert income from other uses and make it hard to obtain loans for other productive investments. The financial trends we describe and the predatory dynamics undergirding them demand greater research attention. If nothing else, they suggest that in an unequal society wi th racially marginalized groups , the pursuit of opportunity itself can lead to harmful unanticipated outcomes."
