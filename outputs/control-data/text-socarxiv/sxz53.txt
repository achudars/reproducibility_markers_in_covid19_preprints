Abstract
Malnutrition is an important issue in developing countries like India. India’s focus on malnutrition has been since its first five-year plan but the challenge still persists. Several studies have identified causes behind the malnutrition but efforts are made to address those causes but results are inadequate. This review focuses on understanding the malnutrition from the systems perspective. The paper critically examines the literature to identify the various stakeholders that influence the malnutrition scenario of an area. The main focus is on understanding the relevance of having systems thinking approach in dealing with the malnutrition issue. The paper concludes that significant understanding has been built around individual causes and stakeholders’ role in malnutrition. However, the need exists to translate this understanding into strategies that are relevant for the implementers on ground who have to address the malnutrition issue in context-specific multi-stakeholder interests and demands.

Introduction
Health of the individuals is of prime importance for any nation as healthy population is needed for national development and sustenance. Nutrition is one of the key factors that plays an important role in governing the health of an individual. Accordingly, Sustainable Development Goals have focused on both health and nutrition for its vision “to improve life, in a sustainable way, for future generations” (UNDP, 2016). Despite attention to nutrition over the decades, the world has not been able to completely deal with the malnutrition issue. Globally, undernutrition is a major concern with high prevalence of stunting (22.7%) and wasting (7.7%) among children of less than 5 years age . The issue of overweight is emerging with increase in its prevalence in children below five years of age from 4.9% in 1990 to 6% in 2016 (UNICEF, 2018). However, the methodology adopted to calculate the nutrition status is questioned (Panagariya, 2012).
In context of developing countries like India, the malnutrition in the form of undernutrition is the main concern with more than 35% children below five years of age are underweight compared to global average of 14% (UNICEF, 2018; World Bank, 2018). While, percentage of overweight children in India are one third of global average, the percentage of stunted children are two third more than the global average. The condition is more severe in case of wasting, percentage of children with wasting in India is almost three times the global average (UNICEF, 2018). 
It is interesting to note that malnutrition remains as a major concern for India, despite nutrition being identified as an issue since its first five-year plan in 1951 (Planning Commission, 1951). Initially, the issue was more closely associated with lack of adequate amount of quality food. Further, the need for proper systems including directed research to address the nutrition issue is also recognized (Planning Commission, 1951) (Figure 1). Over the years of experience and planning, larger number of themes were associated with the nutrition issue in India including vulnerable groups, socio-economic determinants, education, implementation and access (Planning Commission, 1956, 1961, 1969, 1974, 1980, 1985, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2008). 

Figure 1: Mapping the first-time focus given to a theme relevant for nutrition in a five-year plan in India.
The common approach to implement or address various of nutrition needs is through programme mode. The nutrition-oriented programmes started from 1962 onwards under different ministries and department which included Mid-day Meal Programme, National Goitre Control Programme, Community Development Programme (Kapil, Chaturvedi, & Nayar, 1992; Pandav, Kochupillai, Karmarkar, & Nath, 1986; Planning Commission, 1961). Over the years, different programmes have been converged, modified and consolidated (Kapil et al., 1992; Sreedevi, 2015; University of Delhi, 2018). Some of the current main programmes related to nutrition are National Health Mission by (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2018), Integrated Child Development Services Scheme by (Ministry of Women and Child Development, 2009), Mid-day meal scheme by (Ministry of Human Resource Department, 2016) and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme by (Ministry of Rural Development, 2017). However, the various initiatives adopted have been marred with various issues of governance including planning, coordination, social justice, transparency and monitoring (Kapil et al., 1992; Pandav et al., 1986; Planning Commission, 1985, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2008; Reddy, Shekar, Rao, & Gillespie, 1993; Sreedevi, 2015). 
It has been observed that problems in health system are commonly studied in isolation (Trbovich, 2014), this approach prevents in capturing the complex, dynamic and interactive system prevalent in health sector (Atun, 2012) and research in nutrition is no exception. This results in proposing solutions that are not adequately effective as estimated. The recent global literature has recommended the need to incorporate system thinking in improving and dealing with health systems (Atun, 2012; Peters, 2014; Trbovich, 2014; Wang, Li, & Jones, 2014; WHO, 2009). System thinking focuses on the holistic approach towards understanding the problem and evaluating the potential solution impacts (WHO, 2009). It tries to overcome the limitations of isolated thinking approach by identifying all the possible elements that play a role in the system, followed with understanding the interactions and dependencies between those elements in system (Trbovich, 2014). 
The elements associated with malnutrition is known globally, but understanding of these elements role as part of system has been less straightforward. Accordingly, this paper reviews and summarizes the various elements involved in malnutrition to support first step of system thinking and to help in addressing the nutrition issue. Using the intensive literature review, the study presents the potential ways these elements can get engaged with each other. The main elements considered for this study are external agency and socio-economic environment owing to their relevance in any national policy design and implementation.
Elements behind Malnutrition Prevalence
Nutrition is considered a “process of obtaining, utilizing and absorbing nutrients in relation to what is required for growth, health and social wellbeing” (Fanzo, 2014). The disturbance to this process causes the imbalance in the nutrient levels inside the body leading to the onset of malnourished condition in an individual. The malnourishment affects the physiological functioning of the body which makes the body more susceptible to diseases which lead to morbidity followed by high risk of mortality (Figure 2). A global review on tuberculosis showed that malnutrition by compromising the host defence mechanism against tuberculosis in body increases the susceptibility towards infection (Lönnroth, Jaramillo, Williams, Dye, & Raviglione, 2009). Various other studies have established the effect of malnutrition in causing frailty in both normal people (Boulos, Salameh, & Barberger-Gateau, 2016)  and people suffering from diseases like cancer (Kovarik, Hronek, & Zadak, 2014; Norman et al., 2010), pulmonary diseases (Ingadottir et al., 2017). Malnutrition could also increase the risk of mortality for patients suffering from diseases including renal disorders (Prasad & Sinha, 2012) (Bilgic et al., 2007) and cardiovascular diseases (Iwakami et al., 2017; Maruyama, Nakagawa, Koyama, Maruyama, & Hasebe, 2018)
In case of elderly studies, it was observed that malnutrition is strongly correlated with level of dependence in care (Cereda et al., 2016) and mortality odds for nursing home-acquired pneumonia patients (Falcone et al., 2018). In case of inner ear development during foetal stage, the deficiency of vitamin A could cause sensorineural hearing loss (Emmett & West, 2014). Malnutrition during the foetal age is also considered to affect mental health (Räikkönen, Pesonen, Roseboom, & Eriksson, 2012). Malnutrition at foetal age could cause mental issues like cognitive impairment, dementia, Alzheimer’s (Del Parigi, Panza, Capurso, & Solfrizzi, 2006) and schizophrenia (Brown, 2011) at older age.

Figure 2: Causation behind the malnutrition issue
The element of morbidity is not just the effect of malnutrition, it could also cause the malnutrition by affecting the physiological functioning of the body. Morbidity could cause reduced intake of nutrients, prevent the absorption of nutrients, enhance the rate of consumption of nutrients or alter the use of nutrients which causes malnutrition (Koo et al., 2003; Schaible & Kaufmann, 2007; Van Cutsem & Arends, 2005; Varan, Tokel, & Yilmaz, 1999).
The disruption in the process of getting nourished could be caused by both the inherent characteristics and surrounding characteristics of the individual. The inherent characteristics are attributed to the individual’s genetic makeup and expressions which affect the physiological functioning of body (Kaput et al., 2014). Glucose-Galactose malabsorption is one such condition in which body is unable to absorb glucose and galactose leading to weight loss and other diseases (National Research Council, 1989). It is also suggested that microbial composition in the gut could also influence the nutrient absorption capability (Ahmed, Haque, Ahmed, Petri, & Cravioto, 2009). 
The surrounding in which individual lives could affect the process by hindering the process to either get nutrients for the body or utilize the obtained nutrients for the body (Fanzo, 2014). In literature, the surrounding for an individual is studied in two ways in the literature. In set of literature, the studies focused on the various parameters in the surrounding that could affect the nourishment of an individual like literacy rate, economic status, gender, age (Alderman, Hoogeveen, & Rossi, 2006), birth order (Chalasani, 2012), dietary habits (Abdulai & Aubert, 2004), government policies and process (Alderman, Hoogeveen, & Rossi, 2006). The another set of literature has tried to understand the malnourishment from the perspective of understanding the stakeholders present around an individual (Pelletier et al., 2012). The main consensus that could be observed between these two sets of literature is that various surrounding parameters and stakeholders are related. It could be understood that the various stakeholders in one’s surrounding are the key elements which influence the various surrounding parameters values that affects the individual’s nourishment.
The stakeholders comprise of the various socio-economic elements prevalent around and for the individual as well as the various external agencies that are prevalent around the individual (Figure 3). The role and relevance of these surroundings elements is discussed in subsections below. The more commonly studied socio-economic factors like gender, mother’s education and social practices are associated with these surrounding elements. 

Figure 3: Different elements involved in determining the nutrition status of an individual especially child
Socio-Economic Elements
The malnutrition prevalence in the context of development is associated with the children of age below five years. The nutrition responsibility of these children lies solely on the various actors present in the society. These actors could be classified into three categories namely community, family and maternal. 
Community
A community consists of all the individuals living in a region sharing common environment. The actions of these individuals are not always completely independent of each other. Many activities and actions are based on collective decisions like access towards common resources including water and forest as they may provide better benefit to all. These collective decisions could have a significant role in the life of an individuals if the agreed activities are critical for survival. The community can choose certain decisions over others based on prevalent power structure, group aspirations, social capital and historical context. However, these factors are interdependent on each other. Power structure can enable people higher in the hierarchy to marginalize the people lower in hierarchy from various community benefits (Syamsuddin, Neldysavrino, Komarudin, & Siagian, 2007). This could hamper the access of resources needed to maintain the nutrition level of child.
Community aspirations in another factor that could play an important role in deciding various collective actions and support for government programmes. The aspirations would be based on the community past experiences, values and belief systems. In an Hongkong study on urban renewal, the elder people are more in favour of redevelopment rather than rehabilitation activities (Ho, Yau, Law, & Chui, 2011). Another case study in Madagascar on coastal fisheries management, it was suggested that the fishing community may be more receptive towards policies of economic development rather than conservation (Rakotoson & Tanner, 2006). In another study in UK, it was found the community aspirations can influence the educational aspirations of the youth (S. Sinclair, J.H. McKendrick, 2010). Further, in resource-poor settings, communities may prefer activities that serve immediate and concrete needs like roads, schools rather than long-term and abstract needs like malnutrition (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). 
The social capital focuses on the trust and solidarity prevalent among the individuals. It relies on the individual ability to help others in the times of need and in absence of any protocol (Hoffmann & Muttarak, 2017). For example, a family could get help from other individuals in the community to extinguish their burning house due to the presence of social capital. Historical context is an important factor in determining the community’s approach towards addressing the issue (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). The history helps in understanding the various experiences, value and belief systems prevalent in the community. For example, community may be more reluctant in taking outside help if in the past it suffered at the hands of outsiders. During community engagement, accounting for community values, beliefs and aspirations while ensuring reduced impact on elite, could help in better outcomes of development initiatives (Moore, McDonald, McHugh-Dillon, & West, 2016). 
Family
A family is smaller than the community and comprises of the closely related individuals. They have the responsibility in ensuring the child do not suffer from malnutrition. The ability of the family to fulfil this responsibility depends on its stability (Fincham & Thomas, 1984) which is based on family bonding, family aspirations, standard of living and parenting skills. However, these factors are also interdependent on each other.
Family bonding is the connection shared among the individuals in the family. This play an important role in creating the social capital within the family and also enable division of responsibility. However, it may get disrupted due to various controllable and uncontrollable factors. An African study found that the family bonding could get affected if the breadwinner has to migrate from home which affected the nutrition status affecting the children (Fincham & Thomas, 1984). 
Standard of living focuses on the various goods needed in the family for its living. In a Colombian study, it was suggested that the family with sufficient amount of resources could be better prepared allocating greater portion of resources to child development in ensuring nutrition to child (Heller & Drake, 1979). In a study in Bangladesh, it was found that improved parenting skills (as nutrition education) and more food resources (as supplementary food) to mother in economically weaker sections increased the nutrition outcomes of child as compared to cases where mothers are given only nutrition education. However, the significance of difference in improvement in child nutrition level was lost after three months of intervention (Fauveau et al., 1992).
Family aspirations is the important aspect of the family as it could determine the allocation of resources to various family needs and necessities. A UK study showed that parents with lower aspirations also had children with lower aspiration level (S. Sinclair, J.H. McKendrick, 2010). Parenting skills are important as they determine the ability, knowledge and skills of the parents and/or guardian in taking care of the young child (Heller & Drake, 1979). 
Maternal
Mother in the family is the key member responsible for the child development. It is important that her aspirations and parenting skills are aligned to the child development else child could suffer from malnutrition. It is suggested that more education or income may alter the aspirations and priorities of women. In Colombian study, it was observed that increased education of women resulted in lower duration of nursing period by mothers (Heller & Drake, 1979). Parenting skills is another important component of mother as it was suggested that older women had better child rearing experience leading to better child growth (Heller & Drake, 1979).
External Agencies
The child growing in unfavourable socio-economic environment is at risk of becoming malnourished. Parents could be considered as the critical stakeholders, supplier and enabler of child rearing services to the children. However, it is not always possible for children to get appropriate services from parents due to issues with the parents socio-economic as well as physio-mental capability. Accordingly, an external agent is required and accepted to ensure that child do not suffers due to their parents’ inability to provide adequate services. 
The state is an accepted external agent (Daly, 2005; Dingwall, Eekelaar, & Murray, 2014; Goldson & Jamieson, 2002) and non-state actors could also play the role (Chowdhury et al., 2013). Accordingly, these agents could influence the behaviour and functioning of the community and overall socio-economic environment and protect child from malnourishment. These state and non-state actors could be categorized into the political and/or elite decision-making group, the government machinery and non-government groups.
Political and Elite Decision-making Group
Political and/or elite decision-making group (PEG) are the key actors that decide the direction of development in an area. PEG  could influence the socio-economic environment of child based on their interdependent factors namely interest, motivation, policies and resources. (Giugliani et al., 2014) study in Angola found that political support is critical for expansion and nationwide implementation of the Community Health Workers (CHWs) programme.	
PEG interest in the issue is an important precursor for them to support the solution strategies. In case of Bolivia, political unrest in 2008 lead to loss of interest in malnutrition commitment. However, any PEG is exposed to multiple issues that needs attention, so most pressing issues of interest are given priority (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011).  The interest in issue is an important precursor to get support as found in case of Bolivia, Peru and Guatemala, but the PEG motivation is needed to provide and sustain tangible support to the issue (Pelletier et al., 2012). In case of Bolivia, stunting as an issue was invisible to policy makers which prevented motivation development. Further, the interest and motivation are significantly driven by the influence of different agencies present in the PEG (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). In the context of malnutrition, which encompass multisectoral support, it is important to have all the sectors to prioritize malnutrition else it may prevent in maintaining the desired motivation level for the programme. An outcome of poor motivation and support can be operational coma and empty promises (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011; Pelletier et al., 2012).
PEG commonly influence any scenario by creating policies. The decision-makers have to choose between two kinds of approach namely radical approach like land reforms and “patching up the system” approach like mid-day meals in schools. Radical policies may take time to provide benefit to the target stakeholders as compared to non-radical policies (Fincham & Thomas, 1984). The policy is a very critical document as many issues emerge out of the poor policy-making. Bolivian policy to address malnutrition was found to be distant from local context (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). Further, in Latin countries during 2000s, the common policy challenge existed in defining the scope of intervention (Pelletier et al., 2012). Hence, the type of policy created could determine the success or failure in achieving the objectives.
Finally, PEG provides the resources needed to run any nationwide programme. These resources are allocated to different policies. In case of Angola, PEG is seen as critical to provide the financial support for nationwide CHW programme (Giugliani et al., 2014). Resources is seen as one of the common limitations in achieving the various objectives. Further, it could be used as powerful tool to promote or jeopardize any initiative (Fincham & Thomas, 1984; Hoey & Pelletier, 2011; Pelletier et al., 2012).
Government Machinery
Government machinery is the important component of the government system which is responsible for implementing the various government decisions. They are the primary vehicle for any policy implementation. It is important to maintain good relation with community and better understanding of their context for addressing malnutrition issues (Fincham & Thomas, 1984; Giugliani et al., 2014). The machinery capability to implement any government decision is dependent upon the motivation, staff skills, services and processes. The machinery needs to be motivated to ensure that the various policies and allocated resources could be implemented for addressing the needs. There are many factors including professional conflict, workload, poor economic support and lack of clear objectives that could affect motivation (Ashtekar, 2008; Giugliani et al., 2014; Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). Further, a systematic review across low and middle income countries showed that better staff motivation enables improved nutrition outcomes (Lenters, Wazny, Webb, Ahmed, & Bhutta, 2013).
The staff involved in the functioning of the machinery cannot be ignored. It is important that the staff is adequately skilled so that they can execute the various policies provided by the PEG (Lenters et al., 2013). One of the issues of mainstreaming the nutrition initiative in developing countries has been the lack of ability of staff to implement and design interventions (Pelletier et al., 2012). In Bolivia, one of the factors affecting its nutrition initiative is the poor fundraising skills of municipality (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). In case of Africa, it is identified that nurses need training in clinical skills to better detect the malnutrition in early stages among children (Fincham & Thomas, 1984).
Processes focuses on the various systems and procedures including regulation, functioning, coordination, distribution, access, transparency and service delivery that are established to enable the bureaucracy to deliver the services. It is important for the machinery to have proper processes in place to deal various issues that could be encountered. In Tanzania, the inability of machinery to react quickly to the issue of famine and malnutrition in 1969 was the major obstacle to solve crisis (Stren, 1982). The processes are critical for multi-sectoral issues like malnutrition that require coordination from multiple agencies and departments. It is important to avoid (or, at least deflect) the risk of conflict. Further, timing of implementation of the policy is important as too much delay could lead to infiltration of competing interests that could affect policy objectives/vision (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). 
The services are the important component as it is the interface at the which society interacts with the government (Musgrove et al., 2000). In case of addressing the African malnutrition issue, it is recommended to have better services like creating network of clinics providing preventive and curative services and child minding services (Fincham & Thomas, 1984). In case of Angola, CHWs struggled to provide quality services because another department was not providing hygiene services in the area (Giugliani et al., 2014). In case of Colombia, it was suggested that health services need to be carefully planned as they may not always have beneficial effects (Heller & Drake, 1979).  (Lenters et al., 2013) found through its review of literature that mortality in low and middle-income countries is not affected by home based or inpatient care for malnutrition.
Non-government Group
Non-government group comprise of any agency not part of the government including non-government organizations and civil societies. They are important actors in ensuring that malnutrition remains a national agenda. One of the reasons for Bolivia’s inability to maintain the momentum for nutrition initiative was the lack of any strong non-government group (Hoey & Pelletier, 2011). Further, it is shown that in cases when PEG is not interested in nutrition initiative, the non-PEG actors could create interest in PEG by performing strong evidence-based advocacy (Pelletier et al., 2012). 
Non-government group ability to address an issue is dependent on their interest, motivation and resources. In case of Bangladesh, the health systems benefitted from the strong non-government group which strongly advocated various development needs like poverty alleviation and improved health status. Their motivation attracted donors that generated significant resources to enable the group to achieve various objectives (Chowdhury et al., 2013; Nisbett, Davis, Yosef, & Akhtar, 2017).
Way forward
The nutrition status of the child is dependent on the six actors mentioned in section “Elements behind Malnutrition Prevalence”. The understanding of the role of the six actors have different importance at the advocacy and policy making level as well as at the policy implementation level. At the advocacy and policy making level, the understanding of socio-economic environment actors helps in determining the problems affecting the nutrition. While, the understanding of the stance of the various external agents could help in determining the various internal challenges that need to be evaluated and addressed while advocating the issues and solutions as well as formulating a policy to address the child nutrition status (Pelletier et al., 2012). 
Any implementation agency primary approach towards changing the nutrition status of a region is by facilitating the change in behaviour, beliefs, perceptions and activities of the different stakeholders. Such changes in stakeholder is obtained with or without coercive policies. A country like India adopts a mix of policies like criminalizing the child marriage as well as facilitating and incentivising pregnant women for safe motherhood practices. At policy implementation level, the understanding of socio-economic environment actors helps in customized targeting of the various solutions and interventions provided in the policy. Such targeted approach towards different socio-economic elements enable better policy implementation and nutrition status. The understanding of various external agents helps in building the strategy to channelize the potential of these different agents in implementing the policy. 
Developing nation like India is implementing diverse set of policies and programmes to tackle malnutrition for nearly seven decades as well as significant research has been done on malnutrition, but the country still faces implementation issues (Planning Commission, 2002; Rahmat, 2015; Saxena & Srivastava, 2009) and struggling to address malnutrition. This creates a need to revisualize the research designs and perspectives adopted in the field of health and nutrition. (Rahman & K.Smith, 2000) has argued that there is a strong mismatch between academics and implementation agencies. This is preventing dissemination of academic research to the ground. The major cause for such a mismatch could be attributed to inadequate understanding of implementer’s need. The nuanced understanding of the implementation challenges is found missing in the academic system.
The future research should address the implementation void of academic knowledge by focussing on providing outputs not merely as parameters, but the actual functional solutions and strategies that could be adopted by the implementation agencies. However, in order to achieve such an objective, it is important for the future of research to adopt a system thinking perspective of visualizing the problem of malnutrition. It is important that future studies should not only focus on the parameters or individual stakeholders, rather the studies should also focus on providing strategies of improving the different parameters by addressing the implementation challenges faced by the implementers. For example, justifying the importance of mother’s education in child nutrition is not sufficient. It is also important to propose solutions for improving the education level of mothers that an implementation agency could implement within its scenario comprising of multi-stakeholder interests and demands.
Conclusions
The detailed literature review performed in this paper shows that malnutrition is an important issue for the individual’s health especially children. However, several causes of malnutrition ranging from socio-economic to political and bureaucratic to biological factors have been focused in literature. These different causes behind malnutrition prevalence in an area indicates a need to approach the issue from system’s perspective.
Nevertheless, the malnutrition is still strongly prevalent both globally and in India. Despite dedicated and continuous efforts from governments, the malnutrition is still a challenge to reckon with. This is caused by dysfunctionality of any or multiple stakeholders namely mother, family, community, elite decision-making group, government machinery and non-government agencies. These stakeholders represent the key elements of the system which influence the various factors causing malnutrition. The successful addressal of malnutrition in an area will depend on solution’s ability to incorporate the challenges and roles of each stakeholder in dealing with the issue. Thus, it is important for the solution to incorporate a system thinking approach.
In context of developing and geo-socially diverse countries like India, the standardized solutions have provided mixed bag of results. It is important to understand that the various factors and stakeholders influence is context dependent. This necessitates any implementer to have area customized solutions and strategies. However, the mismatch between academics output and implementers’ need creates add up to the challenge. Thus, it is necessary that such lacunae are addressed in the future research.
In summary, malnutrition is an important issue especially for developing countries. While, the past research provides significant knowledge base to tackle malnutrition, many countries are unable to completely tackle the malnutrition issue. The reason is that system thinking approach needs to be incorporated in designing strategies to address the malnutrition issue.
