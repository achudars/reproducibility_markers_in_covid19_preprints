CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY OF THE MALAYSIAN EAST COAST
POOR: A PATH MODELING APPROACH
Abstract
This research aims at examining the direct and indirect impacts of climatic changes as well as
the effects of non-climatic factors on household food security in Malaysia. The study is based
on primary data collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey
on 460 low income households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) of the country.
The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random
sampling technique. The statistical estimation was done through two-stage formative path
measurement model by using nonparametric bootstrap procedure under Smart PLS. This
study finds that household food insecurity ECER – Malaysia is not only related to social and
economic factors, but also statistically significantly linked to the direct and indirect impacts
of climatic factors. The policy implications of the study suggest that design of food security
programs must be integrated with climatic change adaptation programs. The government and
other relevant agencies should jointly develop appropriate policies for poverty alleviation,
household level food security, and adaptation with climatic changes in Malaysia.

Introduction
Food security is a burning issue and of great concern for many nations on the face of the
earth. At national level, the adequacy of domestic food production or capability to mobilize
food on time from international market may be sufficient. However, it does not automatically
guarantee sustained food security at household level. The factors determining food security at
household level are more crucial than those at national level.
There are several factors that are attributable to household food insecurity in
Malaysia. They include political, economic, environmental, social, infrastructural, health
related issues, (Lovendal and Knowles 2006). Some put emphasis on income distribution and
income inequality in communities (Frankenberger 1992). Others believe that it depends on
physical, natural, human resources, and availability of technology in the area (Nyariki and
Wiggins 1997). Yet another group thinks that it is household’s demography and education
that are important. (Iram and Butt 2004). ECA study (2004) suggests that land, land tenure
system, and farmers’ productively are important (Cristofar and Basiotis: 1992). Olson et al.
(1997); and Rose et al. (1995) find that women’s education and their income-earning
capability are important for household level food insecurity in question.
Changes in the climatic factors and their outcomes, such as natural calamities may
also worsen household food insecurity. In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC 2007), the Fourth Assessment Report recorded that food security and malnutrition may
be severely affected by climate change and its variability. There are four dimensions of food
security such as availability of food, stability of its supply, accessibility to food, and
utilization of food. All of them may be affected by climate change (FAO 2008). The effects
of climate change mainly have negative impacts on nutrition and food security (FAO 2007).
Water scarcity and droughts reduce the nutritional diversity and decrease the general food
consumption which would cause malnutrition such as micronutrient deficiencies, proteinenergy malnutrition, and under nutrition (IPCC 2007). The increase in rainfall, temperature,
2

sea levels, salinity, etc. also give rise to human settlement areas being flooded (Cruz et al.
2007; Mimura et al. 2007), scarcity of freshwater (Kundzewicz et al. 2007), increase diarrhea
and other contagious diseases (Checkley et al. 2000; Kovats et al. 2004; Zimmerman et al.
2007). Climatic changes also have impacts on food distribution, influencing people’s access
to markets to sell or purchase food (Abdulai and CroleRees 2001), increase food prices (Cline
2007; von Braun 2007), and reduce real income (Thomsen and Metz 1998).
Malaysia is a very fast growing developing country, but it never reached selfsufficiency in food. Moreover, the climatic factors are changing very rapidly in Malaysia and
have been having adverse impacts on food production. In the case of Malaysia, carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased by 221% during the period of 1990 - 2004 (EIA
2005) and is included in the list of 30 biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Curb Global Warming
(2007) notes that in spite of the rapid growth in emissions, Malaysia has ratified the Kyoto
Protocol and has taken several initiatives to use renewable energy as well as ways to cut
emissions. Malaysia is the 26th largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Due to high
greenhouse gas emissions, the temperature is projected to rise by 0.3-4.5°C in near future.
Warmer temperature is likely to cause the sea level to rise by about 95cm over a
hundred-year period. The changes in rainfall may fluctuate from -30% to +30%. It may
reduce crop yield and cause drought in many areas so that cultivation of some crops may not
be possible (MOSTE 2001). Moreover, the recent projection shows maximum monthly
precipitation, which may increase up to 51% over Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu, while
minimum precipitation is likely to decrease between 32% and 61% for the whole of
Peninsular Malaysia. Consequently, annual rainfall may increase up to 10% in Kelantan,
Terengganu, Pahang, and North West Coast, and decrease up to 5% in Selangor and Johor
(NAHRIM 2006). Tisdell (1996) finds that rainfall variability increases the level of
environmental stress that affects the capability of the system to maintain productivity.
Under the current climate change scenario, temperatures above 25oC may decline
grain mass at 4.4% per 1oC rise (Tashiro and Wardlaw 1989), and grain yield may decline as
much as 9.6% to 10.0% per 1oC rise (Baker and Allen 1993), whereas the average
temperature in rice growing areas in Malaysia is about 26oC. Singh et al. (1996) reveal that
the actual farm yield of rice in Malaysia vary from 3 to 5 tons per hectare, where potential
yield is 7.2 tons per hectare. The study also reveals that there is a decline in rice yield
between 4.6% and 6.1% per 1oC temperature increase and that doubling of CO2 concentration
(from present level of 340ppm to 680ppm) may offset the detrimental effects of 4oC
temperature increase on rice production in Malaysia. Overall, based on the analysis of
minimum and maximum yield of the last 28 years, the macro cases of the national data from
1980 to 2008 of Malaysia show that the yield of paddy would decrease between 43% and
61% if there is a 1oC temperature and 1 millimeter (mm) rainfall increase (Ali and Ali 2009).
In a recent study, based on the micro data on paddy field of Integrated Agricultural
Development Area (IADA), North-West Selangor, it was found that a 1% increase in
temperature might lead to 3.44% decrease in current paddy yield and 0.03% decrease in
paddy yield in the next season. In addition, a 1% increase in rainfall might lead to 0.12%
decrease in current paddy yield and 0.21% decrease of paddy yield in the next season (Alam
et al. 2014). Projection reveals that any changes, both positive and negative, by more than
only 0.4% may cause the yield of paddy production in Malaysia to fall (MOSTE 2001).
It is widely held that climate change is one of the major potential threats to national
food security in Malaysia. Thus, to adopt proper policy options and achieve food security in
Malaysia, it is very important to study the current situation of household food security and its
possible linkage with the changes in climatic factors. Hardly any work has been done on the
impacts of climate change at the household level food security in Malaysia. Therefore, we
make this attempt to study and analyze the problem in an in-depth manner. The findings of
3

the study are expected to give inputs to the Malaysian planners in formulating appropriate
policies achieving Vision 2020. This vision includes the targets of food security,
socioeconomic betterment, and poverty alleviation at the grass-root level. Moreover, this
study may help policy people to develop comprehensive strategy to reduce the vulnerability
of sustainable livelihood in both urban and rural Malaysia.
Data, Model, and Methodology
Data Collection
Data for this study were collected through an extensive questionnaire survey at household
level in East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. ECER is more than half of the
Peninsular Malaysia with the area of about 66,000sq km that covers the states Kelantan,
Terengganu, Pahang, and Mersing in Johor. ECER is very crucial for two major reasons; (a)
ECER is the most vulnerable area in Malaysia due to climatic changes and (b) the income
level of this region is low and poverty rate is high that is an obstacle to achieve Vision 2020.
This study is based on primary data collected from 460 households in the urban and
rural areas of ECER. The urban area of Kuantan and rural area of Pekan were selected from
Pahang state. The urban area of Kota Bharu and rural area of Tumpat were chosen from
Kelantan state. The urban area of Kuala Terengganu and rural area of Maring were taken
from Terengganu state. A questionnaire guide technique was used to collect data. The survey
was conducted by the regular enumerators of the Implementation Coordination Unit (ICU)
from Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states in the months of July – October, 2012. The
survey followed the cluster random sampling technique. Initially the samples were clustered
by location and then by poverty category. Finally, from each category, samples were picked
up randomly from the E-Kasih database. E-Kasih system has been an integrated database
system that has enlisted poor households at the national level to plan, implement, and monitor
poverty programs in Malaysia.
Estimation of the Household Food Security: A Path Modeling Approach
To estimate the influence of climatic, non-climatic, and demographic factors on the level of
household food security of the study area, path measurement modeling has been used. In the
estimation of path modeling, individual dimensions of food security are not observable per
se, and are considered as a latent variable depending on the terms on several climatic,
demographic, and non-climatic general factors observed variables. In the causal models
literature (Spirtes et al. 2000), circles represent latent variables and boxes represent observed
variables. Most of the hierarchical or multi-level models studied in the literature deal with
measured variables, thus, the regression properties are extended. One of the innovative
contributions of this research is the estimation of latent variable models in complex survey
data.
Structural equation models (SEMs) are the most appropriate tools for dealing with this
kind of model. This study uses Smart PLS that relies on a nonparametric bootstrap procedure
to test coefficients for their significance. The PLS path modeling method clearly has some
advantages over other common modeling conditions that present challenges with covariancebased methods. The advantages include non-normal data, smaller sample sizes, formative
indicators, etc. It is called the variance based structural equation modeling that can be
regarded as a multivariate extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The
iterative algorithm conducted in PLS consists generally of a series of OLS analyses (Chin
1998).
4

PLS path modeling methodology allows reflective and formative computations with
respect to the measurement of latent variables. Formative measurement models come into use
when an explanatory combination of indicator variables underlies the latent construct which
can best be used when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa
(Diamantopoulos 2006; Petter et al. 2007). In a formative measurement model, indicators
represent the latent construct’s (potentially) independent causes and thus do not necessarily
have high correlation. Furthermore, formative indicators are assumed to be error free
(Edwards and Bagozzi 2000). While developing the path modeling, this study followed the
formative measurement model. This estimation used a two-stage formative measurement
model (Figure 1). Similar type of measurement model was also used by Alinovi et al. (2009,
2010).

Estimation of the Household Food Security: A Path Modeling Approach
To determine the influence of climatic and non-climatic general factors on the level of
household food security in Malaysia, the study conducted bootstrap procedures for 2nd stage
formative measurements path modeling. In the initial model, only six variables have been
found insignificant, whereas, both the weight and loading of these indicators are smaller than
the critical t-values (1.65) for a two-tailed test, even at 10% significance level. These
insignificant indicators are locality (X7), spouse doing job (X4), head of household having
supplementary job (X5), earning ratio (X6), and household poverty/economic status (X3)
under the resilience factors (P1) that have linkage with all four dimensions of household food
security. Another indicator is current prices of general food items (X17) under the nonclimatic general factors (O2) of food accessibility dimension.
For the validity of the model, it is assumed that when the loading and weight are nonsignificant, no empirical support to retain the indicator in the model is available (Cenfetelli
and Bassellier 2009). However, it is also empirically suggested not to remove the indicators
from the model while carrying out the model for formative measurement The reason is that
removing the items would indicate missing an essential portion of the nomological domain of
the constructs and disrupting the content validity (Bollen and Lennox 1991). Excluding these
variables, normally has nearly no effect on the parameter projections when re-estimating the
model. Removing formative indicators may cause consequences that are adverse for the
measure’s content validity (Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2006). Therefore, this study further
tests the model by omitting these variables to decide whether to retain or delete these nonsignificant indicators.
The revised model shows that due to omitting these important variables, the overall
resilience construct (P1) is insignificant to all of the four dimensions of household food
security (Table 2; Figure 3). Thus, these indicators are theoretically very important to
determine the level of household food security. In this model, only six factors are
insignificant out of a total of 91 factors. Previous studies also noticed that the more indicators
were used to calculate a formative latent construct, the higher the tendency that one or more
of the indicators would reveal low or non-significant weightage. In that case, researchers
suggested placing the indicators into groups of two or more unique constructs, if there was
theoretical support for this procedure (Cenfetelli and Bassellier 2009). Since this research is
based on the second stage, it has grouped the entire resilience factors into a single construct.
Thus, this study considers that the initial model is better than the revised model, and,
therefore, here the initial model is considered to draw the inferences.

Another issue of testing validity is to examine the degree of multicollinearity in the
formative indicators. Previous studies recommended eliminating an indicator to relax
multicollinearity problems if this indicator’s outer weight was not significant and the
remaining indicators could sufficiently capture the domain of the construct under
consideration. Further, it was also suggested to group the indicators into two or more distinct
constructs to avoid the problem. This initial path model already grouped the indicators into
several construct while running the 2nd stage formative model. It was also found that the
remaining indicators were not enough to capture the domain of the relevant construct. Thus,
overall resilience construct (P1) became insignificant in the revised model. Therefore, this
study could assume there was no multicollinearity problem in the initial model.
In the initial path model, all of the constructs have been found significant to determine
food insecurity (Table 1; Figure 2). Thus, direct and indirect factors of climate change and
other non-climatic general factors have significant positive impacts on all the four dimensions
of household food security. Among the four dimensions of household food security, the
impact of food accessibility (D2) is the highest to determine household food security (Z1).
The data indicate that a 100 points change in food accessibility will bring 38.91 points change
in the household food security (Table 1; Figure 2). Similarly, a 100 points change in food
availability (D1), food utilization/consumption (D3), and food system stability (D4) will
bring 18.83, 2.15 and 32 points change in the household food security, respectively.

In the case of the individual dimensions of household food security, while measuring
the dimension of food availability (D1), the coefficient of indirect impacts of climatic change
(I1) is higher than the direct impact of climatic change (C1), resilience impacts (P1) and nonclimatic general factors impacts (O1) (Table 1; Figure 2). A 100 points change in the indirect
impacts of climate change (I1), direct impacts of climatic change (C1), resilience impacts
(P1) and non-climatic general factors impacts (O1) will bring 68.4, 35.9, 9.1, and 34.7 points,
change in the dimension of household food availability (D1) respectively.
In the case of measuring the dimension of food accessibility (D2), the coefficient of
indirect impacts of climatic change (I2) is higher than the direct impact of climatic change
(C2), resilience impacts (P2) and non-climatic general factors impacts (O2) (Table 1; Figure
2). A 100 points change in the indirect impacts of climate change (I2), direct impacts of
climatic change (C2), resilience impacts (P2) and non-climatic/general factors impacts (O2)
will bring 83.1, 9.4, 5.2, and 21.8 points, change in the dimension of household food
accessibility (D2) respectively.
In the case of measuring the dimension of food utilization/consumption (D3), the
coefficient of direct impact of climatic change (C3) is higher than the indirect impacts of
climatic change (I3), resilience impacts (P3) and non-climatic/general factors impacts (O3)
(Table 1; Figure 2). A 100 points change in the direct impacts of climatic change (C3),
indirect impacts of climate change (I3), resilience impacts (P3) and non-climatic general
factors impacts (O3) will bring 70.7, 38.5, 4.4, and 14.7 points change in the dimension of
household food utilization/consumption (D3) respectively.
In the case of measuring the dimension of food system stability (D4), the coefficient
of indirect impacts of climatic change (I4) is higher than the direct impact of climatic change
(C4), resilience impacts (P4) and non-climatic/general factors impacts (O4) (Table 1; Figure
2). A 100 points change in the indirect impacts of climate change (I4), direct impacts of
climatic change (C4), resilience impacts (P4) and non-climatic general factors impacts (O4)
will bring 80.9, 17.2, 6.3, and 17.9 points, change in the dimension of household food system
stability (D4) respectively. Overall, the direct or indirect impacts of climatic factors
contribute more than the resilience or other non-climatic general factors for determining
household food security.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The study finds that the constructs of direct and indirect impacts of climate change, resilience
factors, and other non-climatic general factors have statistically significant positive impacts
on all the four dimensions of household food security. Among the four dimensions of
household food security, it is found that the impact of food accessibility (D2) is the highest to
determine the household food security (Z1).
Climate change is one of the major potential threats for household food security in
Malaysia. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, design of
food security programs must integrate climatic change into the picture, and food security
approaches must recognize climate change as an important driver. This integration also
increases household capacity to adapt to climatic change. At the same time, climate change
adaptation approaches and strategies to reduce vulnerability to climate change also increases
household food security.
Prioritization of needs for investment targeted at increasing food security adaptation
to climate change is important for Malaysia. Climate change adaptations are concentrated on
improving the potential of people, especially the most vulnerable groups, toward adapting to
climate changes. This involves support for livelihoods that are climate-resilient, reduction of
disaster risk, advocacy, empowerment, and social mobilization to curb the underlying causes
10

of vulnerability. To adequately deal with the effects of climate change on food security, plans
have to begin with a good analysis of the groups that are already particularly marginal at
present. They are the most affected by climate change often, and they have very limited
capacities for coping.
Therefore, climate change affects groups that have always been at risk with food
insecurity, and it also affects new groups who become vulnerable to regional weather
changing conditions. Most vulnerable groups already practice some form of risk
management, but their capability to adapt to changes in the climate is often limited due to
their extremely restricted coping potential. Therefore, the climate change adaptation
techniques and food security should empower the groups that socially exclude to lower their
vulnerability and improve their resilience. Adaptation programs must address food security as
a main challenge faced by the populations that are vulnerable to the climate, while food
security plans in most cases offer people’s capability to adapt to changes in climate,
specifically when climate change is taken explicitly into consideration in the programs
design. They are approaches that are mutually supportive. In vulnerable places where people
are affected by both food insecurity and climate change effects, increasingly adopting an
integrated method is the best. This integration should take place around account risk
reduction, the resilient livelihoods, and the underlying causes of food insecurity.
The mitigation options are important when planning for long term programs. In the
long run, the people who are vulnerable should be empowered and encouraged to adapt to
climate change by developing resilience via investments in health, social protection,
education, and such other methods. Monitoring weather extremes and design strategies for
disaster preparation are also very important. Given these effects and the resources needed to
adapt them, resources that realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) might be
integrated as well. Further, the private sector should advocate mitigation methods like energy
efficiency, renewable energy, developments of infrastructure which include dams, floodresistant storage facilities, cyclone shelters, and techniques for lowering water loss in
distribution systems, etc.
Finally, local, national, and regional governments and their resources need to be
mobilized systematically and cohesively to enhance capacity building in communities that are
particularly at high risk with regard to climatic changes and food insecurity.
