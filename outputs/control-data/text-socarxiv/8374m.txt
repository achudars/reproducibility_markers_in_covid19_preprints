Abstract
Although the decline in marriage has been cited as a possible contributor to the “despair” afflicting
marginalized White communities, these studies have not directly considered mortality by marital status.
This paper uses complete death certificate data from the Mortality Multiple Cause Files with American
Community Survey data to examine age-specific mortality rates for married and non-married people from
2007 to 2017. The overall rise in White mortality is limited almost exclusively to those who are not
married, for men and women. By comparison, mortality for Blacks and Hispanics has fallen or remained
flat regardless of marital status (except for young, single Hispanic men). Analysis by education level
shows death rates have risen most for Whites with the lowest education, but have also increased for those
with high school or some college. Because mortality has risen faster for unmarried Whites at all but the
lowest education levels, there has been an increase in the marriage mortality ratio. Mortality differentials
are an increasingly important component of the social hierarchy associated with marital status.

Introduction
Premature adult mortality has increased among Whites in the United States (Shiels et al. 2017),
and at low levels of education in particular (Bosworth 2018; Case & Deaton 2017). This paper shows that
the recent White mortality increase is disproportionately experienced by those who are not married as
well as those who have less than a BA degree. I do not address the question of whether changes in family
structure are contributing causally to the observed patterns of mortality; the question is important
regardless of the causal relationship. Marriage is increasingly a feature of privileged life in the United
States, and mortality is an important component of that pattern.
The married mortality advantage is long standing (Rendall et al. 2011). However, it appears to be
growing in the U.S. Curtin and Tejada-Vera (2019) report that, over the period 2010-2017, age-adjusted
death rates fell more married than for never-married people (7 percent versus 2 percent), while for
widowed people mortality increased 6 percent and the divorced saw no change. This report expands on
that analysis in several ways. First, I differentiate mortality rates by race/ethnicity and education, to
address the rise in mortality for Whites with low levels of education (Case and Deaton 2017; Geronimus
et al. 2019). Given widening education disparities in marital status (Cohen 2019; Lundberg et al. 2016),
rising mortality may be concentrated among non-married people by virtue of group composition. Second,
I examine age-specific mortality rather than age-adjusted trends. The recent trend of increased mortality is
most concentrated at younger adult ages, which contributes to a wider social class gap in years of life lost
to preventable causes (Bosworth 2018). Third, I use 2007 rather than 2010 as a starting point. That places
the comparison before the late-2000s economic crisis, as well as before the spikes in heroin (2010) and
synthetic opioid (2013) overdose deaths (Scholl et al. 2019). In addition, 2007 may be more similar to
2017 for the timing of the business cycle.
Context
Because they are concentrated among lower educated Whites, opioid overdoses account for a
growing share of the mortality education gradient (Ho 2017), especially in distressed areas (Monnat
2018). Geronimus et al. (2019) argue that the “deaths of despair” narrative offered by Case and Deaton
(2017) is not empirically grounded, and that the rise in opioid overdoses may not reflect cultural or social
psychological crisis as much as pharmaceutical marketing and prescribing practices, the rise of dangerous
new drug products, and a lack of adequate medical care. The mortality spike, in their view, may result
from “high-effort coping with adversity” in response to economic uncertainty, rather than despair
(Geronimus et al. 2019:224). Regardless of the interpretation, however, a wide body of research
documents a steepening socioeconomic gradient in mortality, as identified by the relationship with

income, wealth, education, occupations, or local indicators of economic dislocation (Bosworth 2018). But
the role of family structure change in the trend remains uncertain. Case and Deaton (2017) discuss the
decline in marriage as a likely cause of despair among Whites in downwardly mobile social or economic
locations but they do not analyze mortality by marital status. The same is true of Monnat’s (2018)
analysis, although her spatial models predicting opioid mortality include indicators of “family distress”
(the local prevalence of separated and divorced people, and single-parent families).
As the rate of college completion has increased in the last decade (U.S. Census Bureau 2019),
marriage prevalence has declined. This results both from delayed entry into marriage and from nonmarriage, especially for those with lower levels of education; this is apparent in the White, non-Hispanic
population (see Figure 1 below). (At the same time, divorce has decreased, but that change is
concentrated among those with higher levels of education [Cohen 2019]). The decline in marriage may be
an indicator of wider changes in social norms, growing uncertainty, and even despair, among Whites
(Cherlin 2018; Goldman et al. 2018). However, marriage rates remain higher (and mortality lower)
among Whites than among Blacks (Cohen and Pepin 2018), which suggests that the salient experience
may be the rapid nature of the decline and its concentration among socially and economically marginal
Whites. In any event, as we will see, the growing mortality gap between married and single Whites is a
social fact. If single people are increasingly more likely to die than married people, that implies a growing
marital status social hierarchy, which is important in its own right (Cohen 2018).
Data and methods
For deaths, I use complete death certificate data from the Mortality Multiple Cause Files
(MMCF), produced by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), for the years 2007 and 2017.
For population denominators, I use the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) public
use data files, as prepared by IPUMS (Ruggles et al. 2019). This is the method used in the NCHS by
Curtin and Tejada-Vera (2019). With population weights, the ACS data allows estimation of population
sizes by age, sex, marital status, and education level, which is necessary for this analysis.
The MMCF files yields 2,119,349 death records for White, Black, or Hispanic people ages 25-74
in 2007 and 2017, the subjects of this analysis. Marital status is available for 99.1 percent, and
educational attainment is available for 96.1 percent of these death records. I code marital status as married
versus not married, for calculation of a marriage mortality gap: the ratio of non-married to married agespecific mortality rates. In 2007, some states (comprising 48 percent of 2007 cases) still used an older
education coding, specifying years of education instead of type of schooling and degrees completed. I

coded these “less than high school” for 0-11 years, “high school” for 12 years, “some college” for 13-15
years, and “BA or higher” for 16 or more.
The analysis focuses on non-Hispanic Whites, for whom an increase in early adult mortality has
been documented; Black and Hispanic mortality rates by age, sex, and marital status are presented for
comparison. The ACS data has multiple-race coding but the death data do not. Thus, I coded Hispanics
regardless of race, coded the remaining Blacks regardless of other races, and finally coded the remainder
of Whites regardless of their other races. Thus, the Black sample will include those who are Black in
combination with White or other races, and the White sample will include those who are White in
combination other non-Black races; these are very small proportions of the Black and White samples.
Results
Figure 1 shows the change in marriage prevalence among non-Hispanic Whites by education, sex,
and year, for 2007 and 2017. Marriage became less prevalent for Whites of all ages below age 70 for
those with a high school degree or less, with the biggest declines apparent below age 30 and, for men,
over age 60. Among those with college degrees, declines were also concentrated below age 30, and there
were only very small declines or, in the case of women, increases above age 40. Thus marriage became
more concentrated among those with more education. (See also Appendix Table 1.)

Figure 1. Proportion married among non-Hispanic Whites, by education, sex, and year

Figure 2 presents age-specific mortality rates by race/ethnicity for men (panel A) and women
(panel B) for the two comparison years, 2007 and 2017. Panel C, derived from the panels above, displays
the marriage mortality ratio – the ratio of single to married age-specific mortality rates – for each group
and year. Rates are displayed as deaths per 10,000 population, shown on a log scale (a tabular version is
in the Appendix Table 2). As the figure shows, mortality rates increased markedly for Whites, almost
exclusively among those who are single. Above age 65 death rates for Whites decreased. For Hispanics
and Blacks, most groups showed declining death rates or no marked change, with the exception of single
Hispanic men under age 40. The ratio of single to married death rates increased for Whites of all ages
over the decade, with dramatic increases under age 40. At the most extreme, for the age range 30-34, the
ratio increased from 3.0 to 3.9 for White men, and from 2.5 to 3.5 for White women. The other notable
increases occurred for young Hispanic men.

There are several other noteworthy aspects of Figure 2. First, the marriage mortality gap is higher
for men than for women in all groups. This implies that either the protective effects of marriage, or the
selection pressures into marriage, are stronger for men than for women. Second, the Hispanic and Black
marriage mortality ratios are lower than they are for Whites. Finally, it should be emphasized that, despite
marriage gaps, in all groups shown Hispanic mortality is lower than White mortality; and Black mortality
in almost every case is higher than White mortality (the exceptions are small Black advantages among
early adult singles).

marriage mortality ratios.

Finally, I present mortality rates for Whites only by education, sex, and marital status. If White
mortality increases are concentrated among people with low levels of education, for whom marriage has
become rarer, it’s possible the increased White mortality among single people could reflect the greater
share of that group with low education. However, Figure 3 suggests this is not the whole story (see
Appendix Table 3). The first column of Figure 3, for less than high school diploma, shows that mortality
has increased for both married and single Whites, such that the marriage mortality ratios are little
changed. This fits an explanation in which mortality increases at the low end of education are driving the
increase in the overall marriage mortality ratio. A strong mortality education gradient is clearly evident,
which, all else equal, would increase the marriage mortality ratio. However, Figure 3 shows that mortality
for single Whites has increased at all education levels under age 50. For single Whites with some college,
deaths per 10,000 increased between 20 percent and 60 percent under age 40, or about 4 to 9 deaths per
10,000. For college graduates the increases are on the order of 1 to 4 deaths per 10,000 population. On the
other hand, married mortality rates rose very little or fell at the high school level or higher (note the log
scale on the figure). Thus, the marriage mortality ratios have increased in these groups. So it appears the
overall White marriage mortality ratio is driven both by increasing death rates for everyone at the lowest
levels of education, and by increasing marriage disparities at higher levels of education.

Summary
As marriage has become less prevalent in the U.S., especially among those with lower levels of
education, premature mortality rates have increased for Whites. This analysis examined the extent to
which the increase in mortality for Whites is concentrated among those who are not married, using NCHS
national death certificate information and the ACS for population denominators, for the years 2007 and
2017.
During the period when premature White mortality jumped upward, which has been associated
with the opioid epidemic, as well as alcohol-related deaths and suicide, the increases were markedly
greater for those who were single, especially for those under age 40. Among 30-34 year olds, single
White men are now 3.9-times more likely to die than those who are married, and the ratio is 3.5-to-1 for
Women. Some of this increase may be because single people are increasingly concentrated at lower levels
of education, where mortality rates are much higher. But even among those with more than a high school
education, single White mortality rates rose, and the ratio of single to married mortality rates increased.
The fact that married people face lower mortality risks than those who are single is a persistent
component of the status hierarchy in U.S. families, apparently representing some combination of both
positive health selection into marriage and a protective effect of marriage, and this difference has long
been greater for men than for women (Rendall et al. 2011). However, the recent rise in the marriage
mortality ratio in the U.S. is apparent only among Whites (and to a lesser extent among young Hispanic
men). And the marriage mortality ratio is considerably higher for Whites than it is for Hispanics and
Blacks.
