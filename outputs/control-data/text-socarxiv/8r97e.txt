Legislature Size and Welfare:

Abstract
What is the effect of legislature size on public service provision? While the
literature relates legislature size to representation and government expenditure,
its implications for welfare remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate the
effects of legislature size on welfare, exploiting exogenous changes in city-council
size in Brazil between 2005 and 2008. We show that adding a legislator improves
education and health care. However, the results prove true for the services that
are believed to be highly salient to voters and are easiest to claim credit for.
In this sense, education quality and preventive health care remain unaffected
while primary school enrollment and infant mortality significantly improve. To
investigate the mechanism, we surveyed former councilors and analyzed 346,553
bills proposed by municipalities in the period. This analysis largely corroborates
our findings, showing that politicians prefer to provide private and local public
goods. This paper has implications for the design of legislative institutions.

Introduction
Legislative institutions are crucial for welfare and service provision in democratic
countries. Historically, the division of power and the birth of a representative government placed the legislatures at the center of popular consent (North and Weingast
1989). In modern democracies, most countries have legislatures at all levels of government, and these institutions determine the quality of policymaking (Weingast and
Marshall 1988; North and Weingast 1989; Auriol and Gary-Bobo 2012), taxation, and
government expenditure (Weingast et al. 1981; Primo and Snyder Jr. 2008; Stasavage
2011), improve the information and quality of legislation (Krehbiel 2010), check and
veto the other political powers (Tsebelis et al. 2002), and oversee service provision
(McCubbins and Schwartz 1984; Poulsen and Varjao 2018).
Legislatures vary in many aspects, but they all have one feature in common: more
than one legislator composes them. This fact makes the understanding of the effects of
legislature size essential for studying the consequences of legislature on welfare. Legislature size relates to collective action problems (Crain 1979; Rogers 2002), government spending (Weingast et al. 1981; Primo and Snyder Jr. 2008), and representation
(Allen and Stoll 2014), but how these features affect welfare remain understudied. On
the one hand, government spending and lawmaking can improve some services, especially those that have been under provided. On the other hand, adding a legislator
can increase the number of veto players and broaden the collective action problems,
paralyzing the government, and hindering service provision. Therefore, it is unclear
what we should expect in terms of welfare from larger legislatures.
This paper fills this gap by studying the effects of legislature size on service provision. Assuming that politicians want to further their careers, we argue that two variables determine service provision: the perceived importance of the service by voters
and the capacity to claim credit for its provision. Politicians perform a simple costbenefit analysis: if providing a service results in a high electoral yield and it is easy
to claim credit for, politicians will provide this service abundantly. When a service
is hard to credit claim for, the service should be highly preferred by voters. Finally,
2

when services are both hard to claim credit for and of low importance to voters, they
are placed at the bottom of the politicians’ priorities.
To test this theory, we exploit an exogenous variation in Brazilian city council sizes.
In 2004, the judiciary reinterpreted the constitution, unexpectedly changing the number of city councilors in Brazilian municipalities. Before the decision, municipalities
could freely choose their council size, but in March 2004, the Superior Electoral Court
created population thresholds for council size, adding one councilor for each sets
of 47,671 inhabitants. Around the thresholds, this decision represents an exogenous
change in city council size, allowing us to investigate the welfare effects of increasing
the legislatures in Brazil.
Studying the 2005 to 2008 Brazilian mayoral term, when the ruling was in effect,
we find improvements in health care and education. Increasing the council size by one
legislator lowers infant mortality by 1.99 per one thousand infants born and increases
elementary school enrollment by 2.58 children in kindergarten classrooms. However,
we find no influence of city council size on the number of families enrolled in the Family Health Program, the major preventive health care program in Brazil; the proportion
of infants born to mothers who accessed more than six prenatal care consultations; and
primary and middle school education quality indicators. As predicted by our theoretical argument, as voters place a high electoral premium on health care and as mediating
school enrollment is relatively easy to claim credit for, they improve with legislature
size. On the other hand, preventive health care is harder to claim credit for and school
quality improvements are expensive and payoff only in the long-run. Thus, these services remain unchanged even with larger legislatures.
Finally, as our findings are aggregated at the municipal level, we need to demonstrate that they are consistent with the micro-level representation practices of city
councilors. We present three sets of evidence in this direction. First, we show that
the new councilor has access to governmental resources and uses public office appointments to mediate service provision. They have a 91% chance of belonging to
the mayoral coalition, and they appoint an average of 105 extra bureaucrats for many

3

positions at the mayor’s office.1 Second, we analyzed 346,553 bills approved by city
councilors in municipalities regarding council size thresholds. In line with our theory, we find that councilors prefer to provide local public goods (72.9% of all bills),
as they satisfy the populations’ needs and are easier to credit claim. Finally, we ran
an online survey among the councilors during the period, showing that most councilors believe that voters prefer local public goods (68.8%) to municipal-level public
goods and lawmaking (24.6%) and oversight (30%).2 We also refute four alternative
explanations: increased representation of women and non-white legislators; change in
electoral competitiveness; and larger average of approved legislation by each individual councilor.
We structure the paper as follows. Section 1 discusses the current theories on legislature size and proposes a framework to understand how larger legislatures affect welfare. Then, we provide background on the Brazilian context, present the data sources,
and the identification strategy used in this paper. Section 5 present the empirical findings, discussing how the political incentives skew the provision of services and section
6 investigates the mechanics behind the results. The paper concludes with a discussion of how our results contribute to the scholarship and with consideration of the
implications of our findings for welfare and legislative design.

A Theory on Legislature Size and Service Provision

What is the effect of larger legislatures on public service provision? The most striking
feature of a legislature is the fact that decisions are undertaken collectively. Legislators have to propose changes in the status-quo, agree upon what they want to decide,
appreciate proposals put forward by mayors, discuss and improve the proposals, and
decide which changes they will carry on.
1

These results are crucial, as mayors have extensive control over service allocation in Brazilian municipalities: having a loyal official inside the bureaucracy can help with access to resources. In the
Online Supplemental Materials, we show that mayoral characteristics remain unchanged around the
thresholds, ensuring that the results do not come from the mayors.
2
As a bill can belong in multiple categories, the sum is over 100%.

4

In this sense, legislature size is critical in determining the efficiency of the decisionmaking process. Upon adding a new city councilor, the most elementary change is the
increased production capability. Legislative production, analogous to what happens
in firms, may increase when adding an extra legislator (Crain 1979; Crain and Tollison 1982; Rogers 2002). For instance, suppose that working full time, politicians can
approve five bills a month. Ten politicians can together approve 50 bills while 11 can
approve 55. This increases the number of bills approved, and if bills enact services to
constituencies, then we shall witness an increase in service provision.3
However, increasing the size of legislatures also carries considerable costs. Larger
legislatures can raise the transaction costs (Weingast and Marshall 1988), increase collective action problems (Crain 1979), and make forming majorities more costly (Crain
and Tollison 1982). These negative features, together with the fact that legislators
may free-ride on each others’ proposals, may decrease legislative productivity. For
instance, if decisions need a majority or qualified majority to be approved, more legislators create a perverse incentive, increasing the difficulty of approval. Moreover,
legislators are pressured to provide targeted services for their constituencies at the
expense of the entire polity (Weingast et al. 1981; Primo and Snyder Jr. 2008), and this
can raise inefficiencies in expenditure allocation. Additionally, transaction costs within
legislatures may increase the difficulty of passing bills (Weingast and Marshall 1988;
Baron and Ferejohn 1989). Therefore, it is unclear whether and how larger legislatures
impact lawmaking and service provision.
In our view, to understand the effects of larger legislatures, we need to consider
the political motivations behind the legislator’s work. While an extra politician may
increase the productivity frontier of a legislature, the types of services that will be
favored remain unclear. To understand the political motivations, we need a theory
3

An alternative explanation relates to the Condorcet Jury Theorem. In these models, there is a binary
choice with one of them being ex-ante the best. If legislators access the best choice with a probability
higher than 0.5, more legislators will increase the change of selecting the best choice (Myerson 1998).
However, this logic assumes that politicians choose among exogenously provided proposals, which
makes sense in the case of a jury, but is somewhat uncommon for legislatures. Auriol and Gary-Bobo
(2012) compute the optimal size of legislatures considering that this is the solution to the interplay
between specialization costs and citizens’ preferences.

5

that accounts for the cost-benefit calculations performed by politicians.
When deciding which service to prioritize, politicians look into two dimensions
of the service provision. First, the competition with other legislators motivates politicians to provide services that they believe voters want, regardless of whether these
policies improve long-term welfare. For instance, suppose that there are three services, organized hypothetically based on beliefs about which of these three voters are
more likely to reward:4 improving a local health clinic (most preferred), building a
playground (second most preferred), or increasing the quality of education (least preferred). Politicians seeking recognition will mostly want to improve the health care
system, which they believe will most benefit their electoral yields. After getting this
done, they will shift efforts toward the playground construction and finally to education quality. Therefore, increasing legislature size will disproportionately increase the
provision of services that the politicians believe voters prefer and will reward the most
in the polls.
Second, to get reelected, besides providing the services that voters prefer, politicians have to take credit for facilitating provision (Weaver 1986; Fiorina et al. 1987;
Gulzar and Pasquale 2017; Nielsen and Moynihan 2017; Silva and Whitten 2017). Typically, the services that are easiest in terms of credit claiming are either providing local
public goods, such as improving a neighborhood health clinic, or purely clientelistic
and personalistic services (Weingast et al. 1981; Kuschnir 2000; Stokes 2005; Nichter
2011; Stokes et al. 2013; Luna 2014; Vieira 2015; Bertholini et al. 2018). This explains
why clientelism and pork-barrel are persistent in democratic polities. Table 1 summarizes the incentives.
These two dimensions provide a simple, yet powerful, guide of the politicians’
incentives. When voter places a high premium on the provision of a given service and
it is easy to claim credit for the provision, politicians will concentrate their efforts in
4

Note that there is a difference between what voters actually want and what politicians believe voters want.
Although politicians and brokers mostly access voters beliefs accurately (Finan and Schechter 2012;
Stokes et al. 2013), the crucial signal that a politician gets is vote shares, which are aggregated, and it
is hard to disentangle which service generated the greatest electoral yield for the politician. Therefore,
the politician’s beliefs play an important role on the services that they prioritize.

providing it. The more politicians, the higher the provision of the service. Consider,
for instance, constituency service, such as getting a child enrolled at a public school.
Service such as this are highly ranked by the voters, and the politicians can broke the
school access directly, getting all the credit for the provision. Therefore, these services
tend to increase, up to the point of being over provided.
When a service is hard to credit claim, in order to be provided it has to be highly
ranked by the voters. Consider services that decrease infant mortality. Although policies in this direction might be harder to be directly associated with one given politician, every politician wants to be know as the ones that diminished infant mortality.
The death of a child has devastating effects over a polity, and no politician wants to
be associated with it. On the other hand, every parent would be extremely thankful
for the politicians that improved health care and saved their child. Moreover, politicians might facilitate access to medication and hospitals, that in turn is easier for credit
claiming. Therefore, this services will have anywhere from modest to substantial improvements.
Suppose now that a service is easy to credit claim for, but gives low electoral yield.
In this case, although the provision can be unquestionably traced back to the legislator,
voters care little about the provision. For instance, honors and appraisal legislation are
very common in Brazilian municipalities. However, they are perceived by politicians
as low electoral yield, but the legislator that proposed the homage usually gets associated with it. These types of legislation increase with legislature size, but their effect

7

on welfare is negligible.
Finally, services that are difficult to credit-claim, or that politicians believe that voters care very little about, are expected to receive little invested effort from politicians.
For instance, consider preventive health care. Preventive care refers to health measures, such as pre-natal care or vaccination, undertaken to lower the chances or the
severity of a disease(s) in the future. However, it is a compounded chance: the voter
has to consume the service, but its effectiveness depends on voters getting sick. Nowadays we are witnessing how hard it is to vaccinate children, despite all the scientific
evidence demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, rational voters may fail to punish
politicians for low investments in preventive public policies, such as natural disasters
or climate change mitigation (Gailmard and Patty 2019). Hence, voters might also not
punish politicians for low investments in preventive health care because they might
only observe whether a politician properly invested in preventive public policies in
cases of emergency. Therefore, we shall expect little to no improvement in these types
of services with larger legislatures.
In sum, these considerations suggest that instead of looking for overall positive or
negative effects, the effects of legislature size should manifest diversely, conditional
on the type of service studied. The most significant changes should be expected in
services that voters want and that are easier to claim credit for. Services with only
one of these characteristics will be intermediate in terms of their priority and efforts
exerted by politicians in their provision and will improve with less intensity. Services
hard to credit claim and low ranked by voters will tend to be unaffected or underprovided by lawmakers.

The Brazilian Case: Background

In 2004, Brazil was comprised of 5,560 municipalities. According to the Brazilian Constitution, each municipality has to provide its citizens: health care, primary education,
transportation, and necessary infrastructure. Municipalities can have local laws and

8

collect taxes on housing and services. Even though the tax collection is around 5% of
the total revenue, municipalities receive a considerable sum of resources from the state
and the central governments.
A mayor and a city council ranging from 9 to 55 councilors govern a municipality.
Mayors and councilors are elected by direct vote in the same election. The mayor, who
has a more prominent role, may propose laws, tax changes, and organize the provision
of goods and services, as well as the bureaucratic organization. The mayor presents
these policies as proposals to the city council, which can accept or reject them.
For the city council, the constitution states that councilors have two primary duties.
First, they should propose, discuss, and vote on legislation put forward by themselves
or by the mayors. Second, they oversee public accounts, the bureaucracy, and the provision of public services. Councilors can also propose laws and requirements, aiming
to provide public goods and services to their constituencies.
Councilors also provide an array of public and personal services for their constituents. They help voters access public hospitals, transport patients to hospitals, secure prescription medication, facilitate school enrollment or public employment, and
even pay utility bills, or buy food (Nichter 2011). Lopez and Almeida (2017b) conducted interviews in twelve municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais and found that
councilors spend their time responding to a vast array of voters’ needs. One councilor
stated, in one of the interviews, that she receives “... all kinds of requests. Covering
everything from LPG gas cylinders to airfare, and everything in between: living staples, medication, utility bills, rent, airfare, fares for ground transportation, aid, fifty
reais in spending money, grocery bills... (Councilor M. M.) (Lopez and Almeida 2017b).
Regarding organization of city councils, the most critical component is size. From
1988 to 2004, the constitution loosely set rules regarding the number of seats, and
some places ended up with either a very large or a minimal number of councilors.
As an illustration, Nova Russas in Ceará used to have 21 city councilors with only 30
thousand inhabitants (around one legislator per 1,429 citizens). On the other extreme,
Sorocaba in São Paulo had only 15 councilors with more than 500 thousand inhabitants

9

(one legislator per 35,249 citizens). In 2003, the council-size problem gained visibility
as Mira Estrela, a small municipality in the state of São Paulo with only 2,651 residents,
reduced their city council from 11 to 9 seats. The change motivated a legal dispute that
reached the Supreme Court. The Court favored the municipality’s decision and ruled
that the size of any city council should correspond with precise population thresholds.
In March 2004, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) issued resolution 21,702/2004,
establishing a series of population thresholds for all municipal legislatures.5 The
change regulated the city council’s size for the 2004 election and used the 2003 population projections by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The
resolution presented the following reasoning. First, municipalities must have at least
nine councilors. For populations falling in the range of zero to a million inhabitants,
the maximum is 21 councilors. Therefore, the Electoral Court Judges divided a million
by 21, getting a threshold of 47,619 inhabitants. They started with nine legislators,
increasing one by one until they reached 21. Then the council size remained constant
from 571,428 (12 × 47,619) to one million inhabitants. After that, the cutoff jumps to
33 and increases one by one up to the maximum number of legislators allowed (55).
We are not using cutoffs above one million inhabitants because there are only a few
municipalities with such large populations.
This decision makes Brazil the ideal testing ground for our theory. Although an
endogenous choice motivated the change that municipalities made, the rule was utterly unpredictable. As a consequence, around the thresholds, the cities that lied in the
right-hand side are comparable to the cities that lied in the left-hand side of the discontinuity, with the exception that on the right they gained a new councilor. This change
in council size happened seven months before the election, making it impossible for
candidates to change their service provision strategies for the 2004 election. Therefore,
during the 2005 to 2008 term, the changes in council size allow us to study the increase
in the legislature size, holding other characteristics constant. Around each threshold,
5

In Brazil, there is a distinction between the Superior Electoral Court and the Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court rules on constitutional cases while the Superior Electoral Court implements electoral
rules.

10

we have an exogenous shock on the council size that allows us to quasi-experimentally
estimate the causal effect of legislature size on service provision and welfare.

3

Variables and Data Sources

In this paper, we use three groups of variables. First, we study variables on municipalities’ characteristics that should remain constant around the thresholds (pre-treatment
variables). Second, we use indicators of education and health care in Brazilian cities.
Third, we employ variables to uncover the mechanism driving the results. We also
included data from an online survey conducted to explore the mechanism and collected data on bills approved by city councils in municipalities around the population
thresholds. The summary statistics follow in the online supplemental materials.
As pre-treatment variables, we collected the number of city council seats in the 2000
election, the population in 2000, the municipal GDP in 2000, and the proportion of
low-income families in 2000. These variables come from the Superior Electoral Court
(Tribunal Superior Eleitoral–TSE) and 2000 Brazilian Census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística–IBGE).
As these variables refer to a period before the council size resolution, the thresholds
should have a null effect on them. Moreover, the main treatment variable, the TSE
2004 city council sizes, varies sharply with the thresholds decided by law.
To measure welfare, we collect variables on education and health care provision.
For education, we included the average enrollment in primary (K–4) and secondary
(5–8) school. To measure quality of education, we used the Education Development
Index (Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica–IDEB). The Ministry of Education issues this indicator every other year since 2005. The Education Development
Index is a weighted mean of Portuguese, Math, and age-grade compatibility.
To measure general health care, we collect data on infant mortality and postnatal
infant mortality. To measure preventive health care, we collected the coverage of the
Family Health Program6 and the proportion of pregnant women that attended at least
6

The Family Health Program focuses on primary care of families, providing an array of non-hospital

11

seven prenatal care consultations. All variables are from the Brazilian Ministry of
Health data center (DataSUS).
To investigate the micro-level mechanisms, we look into municipal-level data, city
councilors’ characteristics, approved legislation data, and former legislator survey
data. The municipal-level data is comprised of: the number of councilors belonging to
the mayoral pre-electoral coalition; the councilor’s gender and race; the number of politically appointed employees at the mayor’s office; the number of career employees;
and finally, the number of appointed employees in the councilors’ cabinets—all variables come from the Superior Electoral Court and the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics.
We also collected 346,553 bills for the municipalities within 10 thousand inhabitants
of the legislature size thresholds. We collected the information regarding the types of
proposals, discriminating between local public goods, municipal-level public goods,
oversight, and other types of legislation (mostly honors). This information allowed us
to investigate what types of services legislators attempt to provide via city council.
Lastly, we ran an online survey with 174 former city councilors, asking them what
types of policies were more electorally attractive from the voters’ perspectives. Together, all this evidence provides a clear picture of the pattern of representation in
Brazil, from macro-level municipal welfare consequences to their micro-level mechanisms.

4

Empirical Strategy

Here, we use a regression discontinuity design (RDD), exploiting the population
thresholds established by the Superior Electoral Court resolution. These thresholds
represent a source of exogenous variation in the municipalities’ city-council size. As
these cutoffs were implemented in the 2004 elections, politicians could not foresee the
care to low-income families. The program is funded by the Federal Government, but the implementation is local. Copque and Trad (2005), analyzing the municipalities in the state of Bahia, show that the
implementation varies considerably from one municipality to another.

12

changes and optimally adapt to them. Consequently, around each cutoff, the municipalities are arbitrarily similar, with the only difference being their city-council sizes.
Figure 1 displays the distribution of municipalities within each city-council size
bin. These population thresholds remained in effect till 2009, when the Congress
amended the Brazilian Constitution.7 The period of this study is between 2005 and
2008, which comprises a full mayoral and city-council term in the Brazilian municipalities following the 2004 elections.

Figure 1: Distribution of Municipalities by Population and City-Council Size

The credibility of the causal claim relies on three main assumptions. First, we need
to show that no municipality could select on which side of the discontinuity it would
lie. Second, as this is a sharp regression discontinuity, the council size should increase
precisely as the law mandates. Finally, pre-treatment variables, collected before the
2003 Supreme Court decision, should not be affected by the 2004 ruling on council
7

In 2009, the Brazilian Congress amended the constitution changing the number of legislators and their
salary caps, making it impossible to study only the effects of legislature size after 2008. We provide
more details on these changes in the Online Supplemental Materials.

size.
For the first assumption, McCrary (2008) proposes a measure of the distributional
imbalance around the discontinuity, testing whether cases are more abundant in the
left or the right of the cutoff. For our research, the McCrary statistic is 0.391 (SE =
0.299), showing no evidence of manipulation. In the Online Supplemental Materials,
we run the Cattaneo et al. (2019) test of distribution imbalance, that also confirm the
non-sorting hypothesis.
For the second assumption, we know that running RDD in multiple thresholds
may lead to inconsistent estimates when there is an imbalance in the running variable’s distribution around the cutoffs (Bertanha 2017; Cattaneo et al. 2016; Eggers et al.
2018). For example, in our dataset, we have twelve discontinuities, and at each threshold we have a sharp increase of one councilor, from 9 to 21. When running an RDD
on these discontinuities, a consistent estimator should fit an exact change of one councilor. However, if we pool all the discontinuities together with no correction, we find
an increase in council size of 1.63 councilors. This is because when we pool together
all the discontinuities, we are implying that changes in municipalities right below the
47,619 cutoffs (9 to 10 councilors) are comparable to changes in municipalities right
above the 571,428 cutoffs (20 to 21 council members). That is incorrect, not only because we could be comparing a municipality with nine councilors with one with 21
councilors, but also because these municipalities diverge in many other aspects, such
as population to GDP per capita.
To avoid this problem, we show by simulation that adding controls, especially the
variables responsible for the multiple threshold assignments (in our case, the population in 2003), improves the consistency and efficiency of the estimates. Relying on this
fact, we add five controls to our estimates: population in 2003; GDP per capita; number of seats in 2000; year; and a dummy for the northeast municipalities. The reason
for the first variable is the multiple threshold assignments. We add GDP per capita because richer municipalities tend to be more productive and have better public services.
The number of seats in 2000 intends to control for the fact that some municipalities

14

could experience a change provoked by the previous council size, confounding our
estimates. The year and the northeast dummies serve to improve efficiency. Adding
controls improves efficiency in RDD (Calonico et al. 2019) and also improves the consistency in the multiple thresholds RDD. See the Online Supplemental Materials for
further tests and simulations.
For the last assumption, we should have no changes in pre-treatment covariates.
These pre-treatment covariates are variables measured before the primary outcomes.
As the threshold rule selected by the Brazilian Electoral Court was unpredictable, it
should not detect any variation before the thresholds were in place.
Additionally, we propose a placebo test consisting of running the same models but
with “fake cutoffs.” We build these placebo cutoffs by creating a new cutoff between
each pair of real cutoffs. For example, as the first real cutoff is in 47,619 inhabitants,
then the first “fake cutoff” is at 47,619/2 = 23,809.5, and so on until the last cut added
in the main model. We run placebo tests for all the municipal-level variables studied
in this paper.
Table 2 displays the results of the validity checks. At the top of the table, we run
the first-stage regressions, both using and not using the controlling covariates strategy
proposed, for both real and the placebo cutoffs. At the bottom, we estimate the pretreatment covariate balance.
Notice that without controls, the first stage overestimates the change in the primary
treatment and underestimates the change in the placebo regressions. After adding
covariates, the results improve, and the point estimates are now one for the primary
model and zero for the placebo regressions, which are the correct values. Moreover,
Panel B of Table 2 show that the pre-treatment covariates remain unchanged around
the thresholds. These tests reinforce the validity of our research designs.

Legislature Size and Welfare: Empirical Analysis

We study the impact of legislatures on two essential groups of services for welfare:
education and health care. We collect eight indicators of welfare in these services, four
in education, and four in health care. Each of the outcomes is further divided into two
groups.
16

In the first group, we include services that are easier to provide, attractive to credit
claiming, or both. These types of services increase the electoral profile of councilors,
as they are considered as preferred by the electorate and have an intensive advertising
effect. In this category, we have school enrollment and infant mortality.
In the second group, we place services that are either considered less critical by
voters or that are harder to credit claim. These services do not translate into votes
easily or are harder to target and advertise. In our models, we use preventive health
care and quality of education as examples of such services.
According to our theory, we should expect that increasing legislature size will have
a positive effect on services that voters want and that they can easily target. Whereas, if
our theory is incorrect, services that are both hard to credit claim and hard to provide,
and considered as unimportant by voters should also improve. Table 3 presents the
results for education and health care outcomes.
The results for education largely corroborate our expectations. Table 3 shows that
enrollment in elementary schools increased by 2.58 children on average per school
with the addition of an extra city councilor. This result represents a change of around
0.20 standard deviations. For grades 5 to 8, council size has no influence. At this point,
the dropout rates makes spots on grades 5 to 8 to be oversupplied, meaning that we
have more spots than students. For the quality indicators, the results are insignificant,
showing no changes in school quality with larger city councils.8 As expected, the
placebo regressions are also insignificant.
Enrolling a child in a public school in Brazil is particularly difficult in the early
years. Although Brazil achieved universal elementary school enrollment, there are still
very few spots for schooling until the first grade. Finding public pre-kindergartens
and nursery schools is hard, and enrolling is even more difficult, but taking care of
a small child puts a considerable burden on parents in poor households. This is a
strategic time to contact a councilor, who can facilitate, in this case, enrollment. From
8

As education quality takes longer to improve, we look into the 2015 education quality index in the
Online Supplemental Materials. There are null effects, showing that no long-term investments were
taken by councilors.

Education Outcomes

Table 3: Public Service Outcomes

the councilor’s perspective, the classroom is there and the politician only needs to
pressure the school’s bureaucracy to accommodate an extra child. Such an effort comes
at virtually no cost to the politicians, who benefit handsomely from this proposal, as
the credit claiming is unquestionable.
The effects on infant mortality rates are also substantial. First, an extra legislator
lowers the infant mortality by 1.99 deaths per 1,000 children born. This impact is
significant in absolute terms, but in standard deviations, this represents an effect of
0.14, which is reasonable. Second, it decreases post-natal mortality by 0.90 casualties
per 1,000 children born. This result also represents a standard deviation of 0.14 in
terms of improving these health care outcomes. However, neither the coverage by the
Brazilian Family Health Program nor the proportion of newborns that had more than
six prenatal consultations change significantly, and even the coefficient signs would
be inconsistent with welfare improvements. As expected, the same changes in the
placebo regressions were statistically insignificant.
Infant mortality is hard to improve, but it is great for credit claiming and it is highly
electorally sensitive, as it can provide substantial rewards for the councilor.9 Decreasing infant mortality—by improving services, monitoring the health care bureaucracy,
mediating hospitalization, or even by pushing the creation of a health clinic in an
under-served neighborhood—is considerably easier for councilors to mediate. Improving health care is good for campaigning and also has an intense emotional impact
on voters, triggering a strong reciprocity behavior in voters who in turn support the
politician (Finan and Schechter 2012).
Conversely, the Family Health Program and improved prenatal care are great services to prevent future diseases; however, they are either harder to claim credit for or
expensive to provide. Preventive health care focuses on lowering the future incidences
of becoming ill. If voters do not perceive these chances as real possibilities, they are
unlikely to reward politicians who focus on providing those services. Moreover, even
9

Survey findings provide further evidence for the fact that Brazilians rank health care higher than every other public service. Moisés and Meneguello (2006) run a survey in 2006 asking which are the
essential services for citizenship. Brazilian citizens mentioned health care 23.8% of the time; fulltime
employment had 16.6% mentions and education 12.0% mentions.

19

if the voter were fully rational, there are instances when the provision of the service
might be outside her control (Gailmard and Patty 2019). In the case of the Family
Health Program, the municipality has leeway, but the funding is federal, and the central government mandates the requirements and standards of most of the procedures.
From the council-member perspective, these services fall short in their cost-benefit calculations, and therefore, politicians will place low priority on and dedicate little effort
to improving them.
Hence, there are considerable welfare improvements resulting from a larger city
council. Along with other services, most scholars agree that improvements in infant
mortality and school enrollment are extraordinary welfare achievements. However,
the improvements are skewed toward services that agree with the councilor’s interests. When councilors believe that they can use the services instrumentally to get
more votes, they improve. Otherwise, the service receives little to no attention by the
councilor.
In any case, our results on health care and education by themselves are insufficient
to understand what drives changes in welfare. First, it is unrealistic to think that all
politicians have free rein over services and can target and change these services at will.
Mayors and bureaucrats mediate most of the access to these services, and they may
filter the councilor’s demands in ways that could hinder their credit-claiming capability. Second, councilors may not perceive the provision of such services as electorally
attractive, or the improvements in these services may be caused by policy and legislation, instead of councilors direct efforts. Therefore, the micro-level mechanics of the
results remain unclear: we need to show that politicians have access to resources and
that they perceive the services they are providing as generating high electoral yields.
The next section discusses the mechanism, investigating how council size leads to improvements in certain services.

20

From Council Size to Welfare: Mechanism

City council size causes an improvement in specific welfare indicators, but how? City
councilors in Brazil are the lowest-level representatives and are the closest politicians
to the population. However, the literature presents them as very inefficient and clientelistic (Castro et al. 2009; Lopez and Almeida 2017b; Leal 2012). Thus, the mechanism
that takes us from council size to welfare requires further clarification.
In this section, we discuss the possible channels for the council size and welfare
nexus: changes in the representation of women and racial minorities; improved lawmaking capabilities; increased electoral competition; and greater provision of private
and local public goods.
We study three evidential sources: municipal level outcomes on representation and
access to municipal services; the content of bills voted by a city council; and an online
survey of former city councilors during 2005–2008.10

Municipal-level aggregated outcomes
Table 4 presents the results for the municipal-level outcome data. We divide the results
into two panels: in Panel A, we present the alternative explanations for our claimed
mechanism. In Panel B, we present evidence that corroborates our arguments.
First, improvements in representation could cause changes in health care and education (Pande 2003; Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004; Chin and Prakash 2011; Duflo
2012). More councilors from specific groups could shift public-service provisions toward these groups. In columns (1) and (2), we show that neither gender nor representation of non-white legislators significantly improves. These estimates illustrate that
our results are not driven by improved representation. We also tested whether competition (3) or the approval of legislation by the mayor (4) increased with council size.
10

We also had access to 108 structured interviews conducted by Almeida and Felix at the Brazilian
Economics Planning Institute (IPEA) in 2009. These interviews asked councilors about their daily
jobs and their representation practices. The interviews reinforced that councilors see private and
local public goods as electorally profitable and better in terms of electoral yields than legislating or
overseeing executive policies (Lopez and Almeida 2017a).

Both variables were statistically insignificant.
Panel B in Table 4 shows the results for our claimed mechanism. First, councilors
need access to resources in order to want to provide them: a councilor can only provide
services the provision of which they can control or influence. In a Brazilian municipality, mayors have direct control of health care and education provision, by funding
and staffing hospitals and schools. Consequently, councilors need ties with the mayor
to access these services. In Brazil, these ties start around a year before the election, in
the pre-electoral coalition period. Belonging to the mayoral pre-electoral coalition is
an excellent indicator of ties to the mayor and provides access to resources after the
election. Column (5) in Panel B shows that the extra legislator has a 91% chance of belonging to the mayoral coalition.11 As the extra legislator is a mayor’s ally, she tends
to have more access to public resources.12
Second, city councilors need to staff the municipal bureaucracy in order to influence service provision. Patronage, defined as the appointment of selected bureaucrats
to public service jobs, is a powerful way to solve the commitment problems between
politicians and bureaucrats: to keep their jobs, politically appointed employees have
to help the appointing councilor get reelected (Robinson and Verdier 2013). Column
(6) of Panel B shows that adding one councilor increases the number of appointed employees in the municipality by 105. This represents a standard deviation of over 0.30,
showing that councilors have strong ties with the administration. This facilitates the
councilors’ mediation of service provision.
Additionally, the councilors could be affecting the overall administration, which
may, in turn, improve state capacity and welfare. In order to rule out this possibil11

The Electoral Justice allocates seats for parties and coalitions according to their vote shares using the
D’Hondt method. Pre-electoral coalitions have advantages, as they pool all parties votes together.
These laws make pre-electoral coalitions crucial for the mayor’s strategy to govern after the election.
12
It could also be that the new coalition councilor has facilitated the lawmaking process by the mayors. Indeed, mayors are the most important politicians in the municipality, and it could be that we
are actually estimating the effects of mayors on policymaking. Moreover, Bueno (2018) shows that
mayors and their ties to the central government are crucial for municipal service provision. In the Online Supplemental Materials, we investigate whether municipalities vary according to their mayoral
party composition and municipal city council party composition. We show that the composition of
municipal political parties remains unchanged around the thresholds.

23

ity, we consider the number of career bureaucrats in the municipality.13 The result in
Column (7) Panel B rules out this possibility. Finally, city councilors could be hiring
employees to work on their staff, which would increase the number of appointed officials without a connection to the municipal service-provision machinery. However, we
find a null effect of council size on an average number of council cabinet employees.

Disaggregated data: approved legislation and city councilor’s survey
We need fine-grained evidence that our mechanism operates among the city councilors
in their representation practices. To demonstrate the micro-level mechanism at work,
we analyzed two datasets. First, we collected and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed
in 64 of the 202 municipalities that are within 10 thousand voters from the population thresholds. We selected these 64 municipalities, which keep their voting records
available online.
We separate the legislation presented into four categories: local public goods,
municipal-level public goods, oversight, and other types of legislation. Local public
goods consist of services that are targeted at the personal, group, or neighborhood levels.14 Examples are fixing potholes, improving a given health clinic, requesting school
bureaucracy to accommodate an extra child, or proposing sewage improvements on
a given street. Municipal-level public goods comprise proposals of laws and policies
that cover the entire municipality. For instance, a proposal to improve the standards
of health care across the entire municipality or to provide training for all the school
teachers to meet the requirements for a municipal-level public good. Oversight bills
13

Career bureaucrats have to undergo rigorous public selection that afterward prevents them from being
fired for political reasons. These jobs have higher pay and better pension schemes than comparable
jobs in the private sector.
14
Note that our theory does not differentiate between pure clientelism and local public goods, as it is
hard to disentangle these intentions from a legislator’s service provision. On the one hand, fixing a
pothole may be motivated by a request from one particular vote, but it is still a local public good,
with non-excludable benefits in the areas in which the construction is performed. On the other hand,
a politician could adopt the strategy of helping any person be admitted to a hospital regardless of
their previous electoral commitment. This breaks with the clientelistic logic, but it is still considered
private service provision. This strategy seems odd, but as Kuschnir (2000) shows in her qualitative
work, the Silveira Family in Rio de Janeiro did exactly that: they helped anyone that asked for help in
the community they represented. As a result, one of the family members was elected with the highest
vote share seen in the Rio de Janeiro elections in 2000.

24

are requests for explanations about public services undertaken by the bureaucracy.
Other legislation comprises bills that do not fit in the previous categories. Examples
are changing street names, motions to honor citizens or groups, and legislative and
internal city council procedures. To classify the legislation, we use a supporting vector machines classifier on the legislation’ descriptions. We trained a classifier on 3,466
manually-coded laws (1% of the bills), achieving an out-of-sample prediction of 94.5%,
on average. Then we classify the remaining 99% of laws. The words associated with
each category are in line with our expectations. Figure 2 displays the frequencies of
proposals in absolute and relative terms, and the averages with error bars discriminating by municipalities below and above the threshold.
The first panel of Figure 2 presents the frequency of legislation approved by type.
The overwhelming majority of proposals refers to local public goods (72.9%), followed
by other types (17.4%), oversight (3.5%), and municipal-level public goods (3.4%).15
Education and health care bills comprised 11.1% of the total approved bills. The proportions agree with our model, as the local public goods solve voters’ immediate problem(s) and are easier for credit claiming. The second panel of Figure 2 presents the
average number of bills per legislator. Bills related to the provision of local public
goods reach, again, the highest amount at 290.7 (s.e. 56.95), followed by other legislation at 77.6 (s.e. 15.50), then bills related to oversight at 15.5 (s.e. 15.51), and lastly
bills related to municipal-level public goods at 15.5 (s.e. 2.10). Education and health
care represented 44.3 bills (s.e. 8.99). Additionally, when we consider only the legislation related to health care and education, local public goods represent 80.6% of the
proposed legislation, followed by public goods and lawmaking with 7.8%, oversight
with 5.2%, and other types of legislation representing 4.0% of the approved laws. In
terms of productivity, the pattern is similar to the education and health care proposal
proportions, with most of the legislation being related to local public goods (36.4 per
legislator), followed by public goods (4.2), oversight (2.8), and others (2.1). Therefore,
15

Note that the sum is below 100%. This is because the supporting vector machine algorithm classifies
around 3.5% of laws as belonging to none of the categories above. For more information see Collingwood et al. (2013).

Legislation Approved 64 Municipalities around the Thresholds

increasing the city council size has a considerable effect on the production of local
public goods, even when considering only education and health care bills.
We also conducted an online survey with 174 former city councilors who served between 2005 and 2008, asking questions about the common jobs they perform as coun26

cilors, how many votes these jobs yielded, and the mayoral strategies in negotiating
with the city council. While most results are in the Online Supplemental Materials,
Figure 3 displays the services that councilors believe generate the highest electoral
yield.16

Does the service gives many/some votes? (versus few/none)

Figure 3 shows that 84.3% indicated getting a voter a hospital bed; 56.0% indicated
school admission; and 71.0% reported helping acquire medication as the services that
best secure votes. When asked specifically about local public goods, 50.2% indicated
that fixing potholes on public roads results in many, or at least some, votes while 82.6%
answered that local public goods give high electoral yields. As for the electoral attractiveness of lawmaking and oversight services, 24.6% of voters answered discussing
and implementing legislation; 17.5% mentioned that legislation related to recognition
and honors legislation generates votes; lastly, 25.3% reported overseeing a public construction project and 34.7% overseeing the quality of teaching at a public school, as
16

In the online appendix, we put two additional questions on the councilors’ practice. First, information
on which types of services councilors refer to as prevalent in their representational practice. Second,
information on the types of services the provision of which mayors facilitate for councilors, in an effort
to build a governing coalition.

securing some or more votes.
In summary, local public goods that are believed to satisfy an immediate voter’s
need and that councilors can claim credit for the provision are also the ones preferred
by politicians in their representation practices. In the previous section, we showed
that school enrollment, infant mortality, and post-neonatal mortality improve. School
enrollment matches our logic perfectly: voters want their children to go to school
and politicians can target the placement. In the legislation analyzed, many councilors
proposed bills that asked specific municipalities to give specific children spots at the
school. Some bills even had the children’s full names in the descriptions. Infant mortality, on the other hand, is hard to improve. However, if the electorate places a high
value on it, politicians will find ways to improve it, usually concentrating on methods that take little effort and for which they can claim credit. Preventive care, such as
neonatal consultations and the Family Health Program, remain insignificant.

Conclusion
In this paper, we argue that changes in city council size should improve services that
politicians are interested in providing: services that councilors believe voters want and
the provision of which they can claim credit for. Empirically, increases in city-council
size decrease infant mortality and increase educational enrollment. However, these
changes are not accompanied by improvements in education quality and preventive
health care. In exploring the mechanism, we find that councilors have access to services via their attachment to mayors, and they also tend to prefer improvements in
local public goods.
We witness improvements in welfare, but the political logic behind service provision skews these effects. This has a stimulating effect on Brazilian democracy. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, during the 1980s the level of
enrollment in primary school was 81% for students aged between seven and fourteen
years, and infant mortality was nearly 64 children for every thousand born. By 2010,

28

school enrollment was closer to 99%, and infant mortality dropped to 23.74 casualties
per 1,000 infants born.
However, in the same period, policies that were outside this politically rewarding scheme witnessed only modest improvements. For instance, Brazil scored consistently in the bottom decile in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Between 2006 and 2015, there were no improvements in reading and
science scores and only a mild improvement in math. In 2000, among the 32 countries that participated in the PISA test, Brazil ranked last. In 2015, Brazil ranked 63rd
among the 70 participant countries. Therefore, the achievements in infant mortality
and education enrollment become less impressive when we consider that preventive
care could safely avoid most of the hospital care or that poor Brazilians are enrolling
their children in substandard schools.
Perhaps the solution for these problems is to improve the quality of Brazilian legislators (Ferraz and Finan 2011). Reelection incentives will still drive politicians, but
motivated politicians can focus on services that generate long-term welfare, such as
education quality and preventive health care. A more capable politician can devise a
strategy to make these services rewarding, branding themselves outside the logic of
exchanging small goods for votes, and still be viable electorally (Weitz-Shapiro 2012;
Driscoll et al. 2018).
This paper contributes to two strands of the literature on legislature size and its
welfare effects. First, it draws heavily from Weingast et al. (1981), who explain that
reelection seeking legislators have incentives to over-provide local public goods for
their constituencies at the expense of the entire country. This dynamic generates a
free-riding incentive that results in an overall pressure for increased taxation and in
inefficient service provision. This result is known as the law of 1/n.17 Our theory relates
17

Most of the papers testing this theory find mixed results. Bradbury and Crain (2001), Gilligan and
Matsusaka (2001), Chen and Malhotra (2007) and Aidt and Shvets (2012) show a positive impact of
legislature size on expenditure in US states. Chen and Malhotra (2007) find that bicameralism helps
to balance the effect of legislature size (law of k/n). Egger and Koethenbuerger (2010) and PetterssonLidbom (2012) find a negative effect in the cases of Germany, Sweeden, and Finland. Fiorino and Ricciuti (2007) show a positive effect in the Italian case. Although the results seem sparse, most European
countries are PR or Mixed electoral systems. When Weingast et al. (1981) designed the theory, the objective was to describe the incentives in majoritarian elections. Primo and Snyder Jr. (2008) show that

29

to the law of 1/n as we posit that politicians tend to prefer local public goods. However,
the reason is different from free-riding on the tax pool: private and local public goods
are preferred because they are easier in terms of targeting and credit claiming.
We draw from the legislative organization and literature on the representation of
interest groups. This literature argues that more legislators have an ambiguous effect.
On the one hand, it may increase the quantity of lawmaking, as more legislators drive
down the costs of lobbying (Stigler 1976; Crain and Tollison 1977; Crain 1979; Rogers
2002; McCormick and Tollison 2012). On the other hand, it may increase ‘bottom neck’
pressure (Cox 2006), the transaction costs among legislators (Weingast and Marshall
1988), and the informational effect of larger decision bodies (Wit 1998). In our paper,
we use the principle of team productivity (Alchian and Demsetz 1972), but the reason
for service provision goes beyond fulfilling the demands of the lobbying industry:
legislators want to provide services in the hopes of getting reelected. Politicians may
favor lobbyists only when the benefits in terms of campaign resources outweigh the
costs of diverting resources away from voters (Grossman and Helpman 1996).

the law of 1/n only works under some restrictive assumptions and could fail to hold when there are
costs to raising revenues or shared costs with the central government. In a recent test, De Benedetto
(2018) shows that increasing legislature size may also increase the efficiency of the public sector in
Italian municipalities.

A Model of Legislature Size and Service Provision

Consider a set of n politicians and a representative voter. The politicians have two choice
variables: the amount of effort they will invest in providing services that give high electoral
yield and are easier for claim credit (eL ∈ R+ ), and the amount of effort they will invest
in providing low electorally-rewarding services (eG ∈ R+ ).1 The voters decide whether to
retain or dismiss the legislature. If the legislators are reelected, they get B in office perks,
the game ends, and the payoffs are realized. The game has the following timeline:
1. Politicians choose the effort to provide services (eL ) and (eG ).
2. The voter decides whether to retain (R) or dismiss D the current legislature.
3. Payoffs are realized.
1

Services vary in two dimensions, so technically we should provide examples for four types of goods.
However, there are services amenable for credit claiming but low in terms of electoral reward are intermediate
goods, and we could illustrate their behavior as linear combinations of the extremes.

3

In terms of welfare, the voter has the following utility function:

UV (eL , eG )

=

ln(

n
X
j=1

n
X
eLj ) + δ ln(
eGj )
j=1

δ ∈ [0, 1] is the salience of the less preferred service. We use the log function to capture the
decreasing marginal gains from these services. Moreover, from a social welfare standpoint,
δ should be equal to 1, as both services are equally important for welfare. Variations in δ
represent salience variation. The payoff for politicians is the following:

UP i

=

B1(Reselection) − c(eLi + eGi )

For simplicity, we assume that all politicians derive the same benefit B from remaining in
office. Also, notice that the linear cost for providing public services is c > 0, but any convex
function would work.
The politician’s incentive compatibility constraint requires that:

B1(Reselection) − c(eLi + eGi ) ≥ 0
The politicians are indifferent between getting or not getting the benefit from the office if
the cost of providing the service is equal to the benefit garnered from the office. Solving for
equality, concerning eGi , we have:

eGi

=

B1(Reselection)
− eCi
c

As the politician’s payoff functions are the same, we solve for the symmetric Nash equilibrium, which allows us to drop the i index from our calculations. Notice that the politicians
are indifferent as regards providing or not providing the services. We are assuming that they
do provide them, and the voters reelect them, conditional on the successful provision of said
services (1(Reselection) = 1). Thus, the problem from the perspective of voters is determining the required amount of service provision from the politicians:

4

max{ln(n) [ln(eL ) + δ ln(eG )]}
And applying the value for eG into this equation, we have a single variable optimization
problem:




max ln(n) ln(eL ) + δ ln

The first order condition for this problem is:

B

c

Solving for eL , we have:

e∗L =

B
c(1 + δ)

Notice that the optimal amount of service L increases with the benefit from office (B)
and decreases with both the cost of service provision (c) and the salience of the less salient
service (δ). The optimal amount of service G is:

Proposition 1. Let B > 2c. When the salience of service G increases, the following statements are

And after the computations, we have:

Also, we present results solving for a given inequality. For the last result, it suffices to
take the derivative w.r.t. n. This result is straightforward and therefore not derived here.

In summary, the results w.r.t. δ are non-linear, but the amount of services increase with
the number of politicians. In an environment plagued by low salience of the G service (low
δ), increasing the number of politicians disproportionately increases the provision of L service. Note also that when δ = 1, the provision of both services is the same, and the welfare
achieves its maximum.

Legislation Dataset:
We coded the legislation approved by the councilors in 64 municipalities that are 10
thousand inhabitants away from the council size thresholds. We classified the legislation in
five categories:
• Local Public Goods: Legislation that provides a service targeted at the individual,
group, or geographical level.
• Public Goods or General Legislation: Legislation that provides a service for the entire
municipality, or approves a law that does not discriminate among citizens.
• Oversight: Legislation that requests information to the mayor’s office or the bureaucracy about the provision of services.
• Others: Legislation that is not classified as Local Public Goods, Public Goods, or Oversight. Usually honors or procedures.
• Education and Health Care: Legislation about Education or Health Care provision.
Online 2016 Former City Councilors Survey:
We run an online survey asking 174 councilors whether helping with [...service...] gives
[none, few, some, or many] votes. The services were:
• Help Hospital Admission: We asked former councilors whether helping with hospital
admission gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
10

• Help School Admission: We asked former councilors whether helping with school
admission gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Help Getting Medication: We asked former councilors whether helping voters get
medication gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Fix Street Potholes: We asked former councilors whether pressing the bureaucracy to
fix street potholes gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Other Local Public Goods: We asked former councilors whether helping voters with
local public goods and services such as traffic rules, sewage constructions, potable
water, and others, gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Legislative Duties: We asked former councilors whether the act to discuss, propose,
and vote on legislation gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Honors Legislation: We asked former councilors whether proposing bills to praise
local celebrities gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Oversee School Quality: We asked former councilors whether overseeing school quality gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey).
• Oversee Construction: We asked former councilors whether overseeing public construction gives [none, few, some, many] votes (source: survey)
In this Appendix, we present other questions we asked in the survey. They are meant to
improve the knowledge we have about the city councilors perceptions about their representation. We have not added these to the main paper because they were more complimentary
and not of general interest. The descriptive statistics of the variables used in the main paper
follow in Table 2.

vary due to missingness.

B.4

Threshold Manipulation and Sorting Tests

The validity of our causal claim relies on the impossibility of municipalities to manipulate
the placement at the left or right-hand side of the thresholds. We ran two tests to check
whether we satisfy this assumption.
We run the Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2019) manipulation test, which is based on the
12

density of the local polynomial estimator. We use local polynomial orders from one to four.
As the null hypothesis is no manipulation, the p-values for each polynomial order are: local
linear (p-value = 0.442); quadratic (p-value = 0.740); cubic (p-value = 0.998); and quartic
(p-value = 0.620). Therefore, there is no manipulation according to Calonico et al. (2019).
We also graph the McCrary (2008) test, pooling all the discontinuities. The results follow

Population Thresholds in Brazil Before and After the 2003 Supreme
Court Decision

The identification strategy requires exogenous changes in the city council size thresholds.
Previous to the changes we exploit here, the 1988 Brazilian Constitution states the following
distribution of seats per population size, presented in Table 3.

These cutoffs were in place until 2003, when the municipality of Mira Estrela decided to
decrease the council size from eleven to nine councilors. The two losing councilors started
a judicial contestation that made it to the Supreme Court. The court ruled that the Constitution meant that council size should vary proportionally with population, starting with
nine legislators, until the maximum number of councilors, 55. Following this decision, the
Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE) decided the thresholds that should be followed in the 2004
election (Resolution 21,702/2004). According to their decision, the legislature should increase as displayed in Table 4.
As there are few municipalities above one million inhabitants, we decided to restrict our
attention to municipalities with less than 571, 429 + 47, 619 = 619, 048 inhabitants. Table 5
displays the frequency of municipality by thresholds used in our paper.
The Supreme Court ruled that the electoral courts should use the 2003 population projection to assign municipalities to cutoffs. In Brazil, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE) propose the official population projections. Sorting is not an issue for our
identification strategy, as IBGE is an insulated bureaucracy, insulated from local influences
(see also the McCrary test above).
To provide an overview of the data dispersion, Figure 2 plots the municipalities by their
proximity from the cutoffs. In the map we provide the contour of every Brazilian municipality, coloring it by the proximity to the council size thresholds. The darker the color, the closer

to the population thresholds. In regression discontinuity, the closer a municipality is to the
cutoff, the more influential it is in the estimation. Figure 2 also shows that our municipalities
are reasonably distributed around the whole country.

Moreover, we could question whether the discontinuities studied here are sharp or fuzzy.
In order to be fuzzy, the laws passed by the Supreme Court had to be contested or not be
perfectly enforced. For instance, Cavalcanti (2017) shows in his second chapter that there
has been a misuse of these discontinuities. However, this problem was absent in our RDD,
as the problem identified by Cavalvanti was based on the use of thresholds approved in
2009. In our case, we use the thresholds approved in 2003, and until a period before 2009 (in
our case, 2008).

17

B.6

Identification Strategy in Multiple Thresholds Regression Discontinuity Design

Usually when carrying out regression discontinuity with multiple cutoffs, authors pool all
the discontinuities together and estimate the effect of council size on outcomes. Let C =
{c0 , c1 , · · · , cn , cn+1 } be the set of cutoffs thresholds associated with the running variable X.
The outcome variable is assumed to be Y . In the pooled model, the Local Average Treatment
Effect is:

LAT Enocontrols

=



E lim E[Yi |Xi ] − lim E[Yi |Xi ]|∀ci ∈ C
x↓ci

x↑ci

Nevertheless, this may be problematic as the municipal characteristics in each cutoff may
vary from cutoff to cutoff. The population imbalance certainly carries out heterogeneity, in
the way shown by Cattaneo et al. (2016). To ensure we have comparability, and that we
estimate the average LATE for all cutoffs, avoiding most of the heterogeneity, we propose to
add a set of controls denoted by Zi that vary between cutoffs. For instance, the population
that determines the change from one threshold to another also determines all the cutoffs. As
the population varies smoothly around each cutoff, it makes it a perfect control to add. The
new estimator is:

LAT Econtrols

=



E lim E[Yi |Xi ] − lim E[Yi |Xi ]|∀ci ∈ C, Zi
x↓ci

x↑ci

We control for Population, GDP, a dummy for the Northeast States, seats before the 2003
decision, and year. All these control variables are smooth in each cutoff, but are significantly different from cutoff to cutoff, making them adequate control variables for our case
(Calonico et al., 2019). To perform the estimations, we use a triangular kernel, which places
more weight on the municipalities that are closer to each cutoff. To compute the optimal
bandwidth, we use the Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) method. To study the sensitivity to the bandwidth choice, we vary the bandwidth from 50% to 200% of the optimal
bandwidth size. We also use cluster-robust standard errors at the municipal level.
However, as it is uncommon for a regression discontinuity to use control variables, some
18

readers may ask why in this case is it advisable? To answer this question, we run a series
of simulations to show that controlling for the variable that determines the assignment not
only helps improve the consistency of our estimates but also improves their efficiency.
Consider the data distributed in one of the four forms depicted by Figure 3. We add nine
thresholds, at 0.1, 0.2, and so on until 0.9, and we create six types of outcomes. The first
three outcomes are sharp changes. In the first, we add variation from one to 10, with one
step for each change. In the second, we add 1 in the first cut, zero in the second cut, and
-1 in the third cut, repeating this pattern for the remaining cutoffs. The estimated change
should be equal to zero. In the third model, we add one in the first cut, 1 + 0.9 in the second
cut, 1 + 0.9 + 0.8 in the third cut, and so on until the last cutoff. This is intended to simulate
a diminishing effect from one cutoff to the other. The last three outcomes are the same as
depicted here, added by a Normal random disturbance, mean zero, and variance 0.01. We
then run a thousand Monte Carlo simulation for each combination, 4 × 6 × 2 = 48 in total,
fitting a regression with and without the running variable as a control.

Figure 3: Simulation RD with Multiple Thresholds – Data Distribution

A consistent estimator should fit one in the first and fourth data distribution.

In

the second and fifth, the change should be of (1, 0, −1, 1, 0, −1, 1, 0, −1), and the average
change here is equal to zero. In the third and sixth models the change should be equal to
(0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1), and the average change should be equal to 0.5. The first
three models should present a more efficient estimation than the last three models. We display the results in Figure 4, showing that the controlled models are more consistent and
efficient.

Placebo Regressions for the Aggregated Mechanism Outcomes

Here we present the placebo regressions for the mechanism-aggregated outcomes. In Panel
A of the main paper, we run the regression on alternative explanations. As we can see, the
only female changed significantly, but the change is statistically expected in at least 10% of
cases. For non-white, we have not collected data on non-white legislators in the placebo
cutoffs; therefore, we leave it blank. In Panel B, we have the placebo regressions for the
primary mechanism: resource access and patronage. As expected, the placebo regressions
were not statistically significant.

Sensitivity Analysis for Bandwidth Selection

We present here the sensitivity to the bandwidth selection. Following the suggestions of
Bueno and Tuñón (2015), we vary the bandwidth from 50% to 200% of the Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) estimate.

Sensitivity to Different States in the Analysis

The literature considers that some states are more prone to inefficiencies than the rest of
the country. Moreover, some states had such poor Health Care and Education systems that
they could be driving the results by themselves. As a consequence, our results could be
a byproduct of structural changes in crucial states, instead of in council size. We run the
analysis dropping one state at a time, to investigate this statewide heterogeneity. The results
are in Figures 7,8, 9, and 10.
To interpret the results, first, note that most coefficients remain around the same value as
before the robustness checks. The exceptions are with the Family Health Program, which improves without Paraíba but decreases significantly without Bahia, both northeastern states.
In the placebo, the FHP coverage increases when we remove Bahia and decrease when we
add São Paulo. Otherwise, note that all the other variables remain unchanged, except for
gender. Gender changes because there were laws during this period mandating a minimum
amount of female candidates. It is expected that one variable changes as a response to randomness.

Sensitivity to the Functional Form Analysis

In the paper, we run all the regressions using local linear polynomials. Gelman and Imbens
(2014) show that local linear and quadratic polynomials are better in terms of consistency
than cubic and quartic.
However, we run here all the models using polynomials from local linear to a quartic,
showing that our results are robust to different regression functional forms. With two exceptions, the results are mostly consistent. First, quadratic and cubic polynomials make the
significance go away in some models. Second, quartic polynomials seem to make the Family Health Program (FHP) significant and negative, which goes in line with our theoretical
predictions. Figures 11 and 12 present the results for the real and the placebo cutoffs.

Sensitivity to Covariates

The control variables play an essential role in our model. As we argued before, without
controls, the first stage is inconsistent, and we may be capturing differences between cutoffs,
instead of within cutoffs.
However, if the selection of controls makes the models overestimate quantities in the
directions our narrative emphasizes, this would pose a considerable credibility issue for our
analysis. To study the sensitivity to controls, we run the same regressions for all possible
control combinations. Figure 13 displays the results for this sensitivity test.2

2

In the Figure, NC stands for No Controls. The controls used are gdp, the municipal GDP in a given year;
nseats2000, the number of seats before the 2003 Supreme Court decision; northeast, a dummy variable for Northeast Brazil; pop2003_2, population in 2003 (underscore 2 means that is population by thousands); and year.

Infant Mortality

RD Outcomes

For instance, changes in controls have a substantial effect on the detected differences in
the Family Health Program coverage, as well as in Elementary Education Quality.
In our view, our choice was the most conservative, as the Full Model is significant
when most of the combinations also are significant. Otherwise, our model is not significant
when most combinations are also insignificant. Regarding the point estimates, our analysis
chooses the smaller coefficient sizes systematically for the significant variables.
We also plot sensitivity tests to covariates in the placebo regressions in Figures 14 and 15.
The theoretical expectations here are that most of these outcomes would fail, and the graphs
indeed confirm these expectations.

Sensitivity to Additional Cutoffs

To study the sensitivity to the number of cutoffs, as well as a possibility of diminishing
returns from the additional legislator, we run regressions limiting the population sizes to
half the cutoffs, from the second cutoff to the last. This strategy is similar to adding one
cutoff at a time. The results are stable and do not change our main conclusions. Moreover,
there is no increasing or decreasing pattern, which would indicate that differential returns
are occurring. Figures 16 and 17 display the results for the main cutoffs, while Figures 18
and 19 present the same results for the placebo cutoffs.

Further analysis on the role of mayors, mayoral parties, and parties
in the city council.

In this section, we analyze the role of political composition of city council and mayoral parties on outcomes. We also analyzed the revenues and transfers from the Federal government
to municipalities.

B.13.1

Mayoral parties

Mayors in Brazil have considerably more discretionary power to implement policies when
compared with city councilors. Therefore, our outcomes could be byproduct of the mayor
in power. To avoid this possibility, we run the regressions using the mayoral parties as an
outcome. The results below show no differences in likelihood of electing a mayor from PT,
PSDB, PMDB, and PFL when we add an extra councilor.

Transfers and revenue

To investigate whether transfers are driving our results, we run the regressions on federal
transfers and revenue raised within the municipalities. There is only a small effect on education transfer. The other indicators remain insignificant. Note that the placebo is significant,

Legislation Dataset

In the Fall of 2018, we collected the data on the legislation approved by the city council of
64 municipalities 10 thousand inhabitants away from the thresholds. There are 202 municipalities at a 10 thousand inhabitants distance from the cutoff, but only 64 had information
on the legislation for the period between 2005 to 2008.
To classify the legislation, we hand-coded 1% of the dataset (3,466 cases) and applied a
Supporting Vector Machines algorithm to the remaining 99% cases. First, we train and test
the accuracy of the SVM classifier on 80% of the dataset. Then, we ran the training on the
full hand-coded data and predicted the remaining.3
We hand-coded using five characteristics:
1. Local Public Goods: Whether the bills provided a local public good or service. Bills
here are, for example, proposals to fix street potholes, staff a given health clinic, purchase equipment to a given school. To lay on this category, the service should have
been targeted for a fraction of the population.
2. Public Goods and Legislation: Whether a bill is about a municipal public good (e.g.,
improving education), or about legislation that does not discriminate against any citizen within the polity (general law).
3

We tested SVM, Naive-Bayes, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. We choose SVM as it gives the highest prediction rate. We are using a simple bag-of-words classifier, with the R package RTextTools (Collingwood
et al., 2013).

47

4. Others: Legislation that is not categorized as any of the previous three listed. Legislation here includes honors to notable citizens and procedure legislation, among others.
5. Health Care and Education: Bills on education and health care, broadly defined.
We run the SVM on the hand-coded data. Table 15 shows the classification accuracy
for each of the variables that we hand-coded. In all models, we set cost equals 10 to avoid
overfitting.
After we classify all the bills, the frequency in each category was added to the main paper.
We also add the productivity per legislator, consisting of a ratio of the legislation approved
in the municipality in the four-year term, divided by the council size. As expected, the
results changed little from when we considered the absolute values.

City Councilors Survey

From November 21st to December 1st, 2016, we surveyed former city councilors that served
in the 2005 to 2008 period. We asked them questions regarding how mayors secure electoral
support, which services are common in the city councilor’s practice, and which services give
the highest electoral yield.
We used 3,240 emails from politicians that ran in the 2016 election, filtering the politicians
that hold public office in 2005. In December 1st we closed the pool, having 174 responses.

To weight the survey, we use the Legislative Census, which was conducted ran in 2005 by
the Brazilian Senate company Interlegis to improve the quality of the legislative. We use the
categories of Brazilian region, legislature size (9 to 15 or more), gender, and age less than 39,
re-weighting the collected data to match the population proportions. We use the proportions
on each bin to weight the graphs and statistics generated after the raking process.4 Table 16
shows the sample, population, and weighted proportions.

Note that the algorithm performed well, with minimal differences occurring only after
the third decimal place.
The questions of interest for this research, asked in the survey were:
1. No Brasil é comum que o prefeito tenha de negociar para ter maioria na Câmara de
Vereadores. Com que frequência, o(a) Sr(a) acha que o prefeito usa os seguintes dispositivos para conseguir apoio?
2. Quais dessas atividades o(a) Sr(a) acredita serem mais comuns no trabalho da maioria
dos vereadores?
4

The R package survey describes in detail the raking process (Lumley et al., 2004). In summary, it iterates
the post-stratification procedure until the sample marginals match the population marginals for all variables.

50

3. Quais dessas atividades o(a) Sr(a) acredita que ajudam mais um vereador durante a
eleição?
A free translation to English would be:
1. In Brazil, it is common that mayors negotiate the majority within the city council. What
is the frequency that mayors use the following services in exchange for support?
2. Which of those activities do city councilors perform the most in their representation
practices?
3. Which of the following activities do you believe helps city councilors the most in elections?
The second question is essential, as it reports whether councilors do the activities that
give more electoral yield. Figure 21 shows the results for each of the activities we studied
the electoral yield.

How common in the councilor's practice are the following services?

Figure 21: City Councilor’s Common Activities

The last question measures the willingness of mayors to give services to city councilors.
This question is relevant, as mayors control most of the bureaucracy and the mediation
of services requires a good relationship with mayors. Figure 22 shows the results for the
mayoral activities.

How frequently do mayors use following instruments to amass councilor's support?

Figure 22: Mayor negotiated services in exchange of support

Therefore, both Figures show that councilors do perform the tasks that give the most
electoral yield. The exception is the category of honor legislation, which most legislators
seem to perform, even though they acknowledge that it provides little electoral returns.
Regarding the services that mayors use to negotiate with the coalition, note that jobs in
exchange of support are the highest ranked strategy by councilors. Our results capture that,
as an increase in city council size has a positive effect on the number of appointed employees
in the municipality.
