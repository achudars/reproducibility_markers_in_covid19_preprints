Abstract
Throughout the teaching/learning process of speaking, a teacher’s role is believed to hold great
importance. Teachers initiate learners to the whole learning process, and their feedback constitutes
the significant step forward that triggers learners towards enunciating a language. As an
illustration, Swain (1985, 2000) uses empirical evidence to show the importance of teacher’s
feedback during the production of speaking. Relatable to feedback during oral activity are issues
that highlight teachers’ pronunciation, fluency, body language, facial expressions, and error
correction during the production phase. To identify these areas, the current article used students’
questionnaires. The general aim is to gauge learners’ perceptions, practices and problems. Results
highlight the pivotal teachers’ role in the whole process. Therefore, the specific aim of this study
is to investigate the role of teachers’ feedback during speaking activities in Moroccan classes.
Results show that interaction enhancement and negotiation density do indeed establish the
interconnection between accuracy and fluency. Some speech strategists and specialists have
already demonstrated how instruction and the way teachers provide feedback do play a major role
in learners’ speaking skills including the need for a contrary evidence.
Key words: feedback, learners’ perceptions, Moroccan classes, speaking activity, teachers’ role

The Important Role of Teachers’ Feedback during Speaking Activities

1. Empirical studies on teachers’ feedback
It is with the introduction of Swain’s concept of ‘comprehensible output’ that the idea of ‘being
pushed up’ has paved the way for more research on the area of teacher-student feedback. Swain
(2008, pp. 471-484) reports Mackey’s (2002) experiment, which showed that students’ perception
of being pushed is highest when the feedback comes from the teacher. Reporting Mackey’s
findings in that area, Swain registers that the fact that learners received teachers’ feedback made
the students establish modifications to suit their interlocutors with varying degrees according to
the setting, type of interaction and whether they interact with native speakers or non- native
speakers.
Taking into account these findings, Swain, (2008) concludes that: “the students’ perception of
being ‘pushed’ is ‘highest’ when the feedback comes from the teacher and that it is ‘least’ when it
comes from a nonnative speaking peer”. (p. 473) These empirical findings show the importance of
teachers’ feedback in the classroom in pushing students to make more repair or modification in
their speaking which results in fluency and density of negotiation.
Joining this idea, Williams (2008, pp. 684-691) points out that the main virtue of negotiation is
focused on both form and meaning or the establishment of the form-meaning connection. She
refers to the distinction set by Lyster (1998) between the mediation of purpose and the negotiation
of form. The latter is usually initiated by the teacher and in this case message comprehensibility is
not the problem, instead it is the different forms of feedback on an error in message form. However,
this implies that the negotiation of style is a problematic process. Practically, teachers’ input on
message form is of utmost significance for students who need contrary evidence to correct their
errors in the form, which helps them establish the link with the meaning.
Correspondingly, an important issue concerning the validity of teachers’ rectifications of the
errors learners make is at hand. Williams argues that not all errors pointed out by teachers will be
rectified or at least recognized as such by learners. Lyster and Ranta (1997), as William reports,
distinguish among various types of feedback. On the other hand, Murano (2000), as Williams
explains, suggests a particular feedback technique to help increase accuracy. It is described as a
“pedagogical technique that interconnects input and output enhancement”, Williams, (2008)
explains this technique as follows:
…. in response to TL (teacher language) use, the teacher repeated learners’ output,
helping to confirm learners’ hypotheses. In response to non- target like output, the
teacher requested repetition, and if necessary, recast learner output. Muranoi found this
technique effective in increasing accuracy… (p. 685)
Like Swain, Williams also holds that “modifications of learner output toward the target
language by the intervention of an interlocutor/teacher” are effective as a method of providing
concentrated feedback on form. She calls them ‘recasts’ and qualifies them as ‘a subset of
feedback’ (p.685). According to Williams, this is true either in experimental studies (Braidi, 2002;
Mackey & Philip, 1998; Long, & Robinson, 1998; Ortega, 1999), or in classroom studies (Ayoun,
2001; Doughty & Varela, 1998).

These experimental studies, according to Williams, show the efficiency of recasts and
interaction enhancement used by teachers. The teachers did not just reformulate the utterance but
also used “emphatic and rising intonation in their repetition of the learner error” (p.685),
highlighting thus the learners’ error before providing the accurate forms, which made their
feedback less ambiguous.
In an attempt to establish a compromise or a link between form and meaning and basing her
argument on a FonF (Focus on Form) approach to language, Williams (2008, p. 686) adheres to
the belief that learners need to recognize the gap between their production and the teachers’
language. To do that, they have to notice the teachers’ response as being corrective increasing,
therefore, their need for a clearly signaled contrary evidence. Based on the above -mentioned
studies, this becomes absolutely crucial to speaking situations in second language (L2) classes.
2. Research Question
Basing on above- evoked studies, the current article investigates the important role of teachers’
feedback in an attempt to answer the following research question:
“What are students’ responses and perceptions about teachers’ role and feedback in Moroccan
secondary school classes?”
3. Methodology
In the human sciences, in addition to pure experimental research, many adaptations of
exploratory models, called quasi-experimental, non-experimental or diverse designs have been
developed. The nature of the present article required the adoption of a mixed design. Thus, two
hundred (200) students’ questionnaires have been issued. The students’ questionnaire was used to
attempt at gauging learners’ perceptions, practices and problems. This is done through multiple
assumptions that need to be tested using statistical analysis basing on SPSS (Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences).
For quantitative data analysis, since chi-square test is a statistical test commonly used to
compare observed data with expected data, it is used to test the Goodness-Of –Fit (Macfarland,
1998) for the multiple hypotheses. The Chi-Square tests do imply and are analyzed through:
➢ (a) Determining the chi-square value to see whether it is received by mere chance or
that other factors do interfere. The chi-square value represents the degree of interference,
so the higher the cost, the higher the degree of obstruction.
➢ (b) Determining the critical p value (the percent probability divided by 100) that a
specific chi-square value was obtained by chance alone. In studies similar to the present
one, the p- value means the probability that the observed results deviate from the
expected results due to random variation in the sampling process.
Concerning the significance level, the present study has set a .05 p level. Therefore, all levels
found less than this level < .05 are reported significant, and those beyond that level > .05 are
reported insignificant.

4. Students’ sample
The students chosen as a sample for this study come from different schools in the academy of
Rabat-Salè-Zemmour-Zaer area and belong to three different educational levels including
common core, first year and second -year baccalaureate. Taking into account the fact that the
new sub-categorization of programs includes fourteen branches, the sample has been selected
from the two broadest ones, namely literary and science without specific sub-categorization of
the two.
The sample included both male and female students covering age categories ranging from 15
to 21 years. The following table shows information related to the learners’ number, gender,
educational level and age range in more detail.

shows that a right proportion of learners’ age category is fixed at sixteen to seventeen years
(60.5%) totaling 33% aged 16 and 27.5% aged 17. A growing population (20.5%) of students aged
just 15 is recognized while the least age category proportion is aged 20 to 21 with a percentage
estimated at only (2.5%).
All three secondary educational levels have contributed to this research, as table
(1demonstrates. Since oral activity is a long process that needs to be improved through both
knowledge building and skill- building, samples from all three levels have been represented. This
was done to engage learners who have developed several observations throughout their learning
process including all levels. Finally, on the whole, both science and literary students have been
represented in this research with approximately equal student frequency proportions (science= 97;
literary= 103)

(respectively)

Students’ perceptions of teachers’ role and feedback reveal highly significant values related to
pronunciation. As items 2, 3, five show, estimations of students’ perceptions record that teachers
do pronounce English well and do initiate students to how words are marked with a p high value
(.000) obtained for all these items. On the other hand, the top p values obtained (p=.000) along
with their corresponding high q values emphasize the pivotal role teachers play during speaking
activities. This is particularly true concerning positive reinforcement (q=788), non- verbal
communication (q= 776) and prompting (q=788).
Very significant results also relate to teachers’ feedback on errors. Therefore, students believe
teachers do help them speak (q=780), use their names (q=788), do not interrupt them to correct
their mistakes (q= 780) and do encourage them to talk even when they commit mistakes (q=780).
6. Discussion and pedagogical implications
Both the quantitative and the qualitative findings pinpoint to teachers’ role as being highly
significant regardless of how long they have been teaching. In sum, for teaching experience
particularly, hypotheses related to waiting time instruction and thanking have registered slightly
higher deviations for the less than ten years of teaching experience. Given these results, further
investigation of this issue involving more extensive samples of teachers should be conducted in
the Moroccan English as a foreign language (EFL) classes.
It is essential, however, to mention that results linked to the initial RQ (research question) and
regardless of teaching experience have corroborated other findings showing the importance of the
teachers’ role given the high significance values obtained for both quantitative and qualitative
results. All items relating to the teacher’s role, particularly in the area of feedback have registered
high significance repeatedly. These results match with those of previous research on this issue.
Thus, Swain’s findings concerning French immersion learners, for instance, revealed the same
importance for teachers’ role. For Swain (1985, 2000, 2008), it is output that pushes learners to
process language more deeply. She uses the concept of ‘comprehensible output’, which implies
the underlying idea of ‘pushing up’ learners to produce more output through negotiation. A
question worth raising here is: “to what extent can the present study results corroborate Swain’s
notion of comprehensible output?” Answer to this question needs further research in the area of
teacher-student feedback or interaction in the Moroccan EFL context.
An attempt to reply to this question through the findings in the present study will necessitate
grounding argument on Swain’s investigation (2008:471-484) Swain reports Mackey’s (2002)
empirical findings which retained that students’ perception of being pushed is highest when the
feedback comes from the teacher. Swain, in this instance, advocates the necessity to push learners
to produce messages that are not only coherent and appropriate but also linguistically correct. The

relevance of these results to the present study refer to both appropriateness and accuracy. In the
same respect, the Moroccan learners included in the current research have identified formnegotiation as one of the factors impacting the speaking skill at the level of repair more
particularly.
Henceforth, the pertinence to Swain’s findings is undeniable especially as she registers that
learners receiving teachers’ feedback or what she identifies as being pushed up made the students
bring modifications to suit their interlocutors with varying degrees according to the setting, the
type of interaction and whether they interact with native or nonnative speakers. More clearly,
research on this area may refer to peer correction during repair more particularly. Swain retained
that “the students’ perception of being pushed is highest when the feedback comes from the teacher
her/himself and that it is least when it comes from a nonnative speaking peer.”
7. Conclusion
These empirical findings emphasize the importance of teachers’ feedback in the classroom in
pushing students to make more repair or modifications in their vocal performance, which results
in a density of negotiation.
In conclusion, current article shows the pertinence of teachers’ feedback in the classroom
particularly when pushing students to make modifications in their responses. This results in
improving performance and intensifying negotiation
