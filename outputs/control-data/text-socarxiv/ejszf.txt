Abstract
Background: Two developmental screening instruments for infants and young children, the Ages & Stages
Questionnaires-Third Edition (ASQ-3) and the Ages & Stages Questionnaires: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE), are
widely used in the US and internationally. Both tools are sometimes used concurrently but the relation between
children’s scores on the two tools is seldom investigated.
Methods: The Brazilian versions of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE, known as the ASQ-BR and ASQ:SE-BR, were used for
assessing 13,470 children ages one to four in public child daycare centres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Four groups were
defined according to children’s ages as one, two, three, and four year-olds. Correlation and multiple regression were
employed to explore the relation between children’s scores on the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR.
Results: Results indicated that the domain scores of ASQ-BR, including communication (r = -0.38 to -0.44), gross
motor (r = -0.19 to -0.32), fine motor (r = -0.33 to -0.45), problem solving (r = -0.36 to -0.42), and personal-social (r
= -0.38 to -0.51) were significantly correlated with ASQ:SE-BR scores. Regression analyses suggested that the
communication and personal-social domains were significant predictors of social-emotional scores in most of the age
groups.
Conclusion: General developmental assessment is suggested to be conducted with social-emotional screening. If the
workload is heavy for administers to use both screeners concurrently, social-emotional screening is recommended
for children who fail communication or personal-social domains on developmental screening tests.

children ages 1-4 years by analysing an existing
large-scale dataset collected on developmental
outcome data on the entire preschool children
population receiving in public child daycare
centres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Understanding
this relationship will inform the practice of early
identification by providing information about
when and whether the assessment of socialemotional competence should be conducted
together with general developmental assessment
for infants and young children. Research
questions included: (1) What are the correlations
between the domain scores of the ASQ-3 and the
scores of the ASQ:SE in young children ages 14?; (2) To what extent do the domain scores of
the ASQ-3 predict the ASQ:SE scores?

Method
Participants
Between 2010 and 2012, a child development
project called the Development of Indicators for
Monitoring Public Child Daycare Centers was
conducted in the City of Rio de Janeiro
(Filgueiras & Landeira-Fernandez, 2014). The
purpose of this project was to translate and adapt
selected assessments for use in Brazilian public
child daycare centres and to explore their
psychometric characteristics for future use.
Children attending Rio municipal public daycare
centres and preschools were included in this
project and were measured continuously from
2011 to 2012.
Beginning in 2011, the Office of the Education
Secretary of the City of Rio de Janeiro conducted
8-hour training sessions for the directors of the
city’s public daycare centres and preschools.
Approximately 30 directors participated in each
training session. Information about the ASQ-BR
and ASQ:SE-BR (i.e. The Brazilian version of
the ASQ:3 and ASQ-SE) was presented and
explained by professionals familiar with the
screening. Directors were responsible for taking
the ASQ-BR and ASQ:SE-BR protocols to their
daycare centres and training their teachers and
classroom assistants on their use.
Participating teachers completed the ASQ-BR
and ASQ:SE-BR on five or six children in their

classrooms based on their daily experiences and
observations of the children. Each child was
assessed by one specific teacher once only. If
there were items that the teacher was unable to
observe in the classroom, he or she attempted to
interview parents to answer the questions, in a
collaborative process as recommended by the
ASQ developers, to facilitate communication
between a parent and a teacher about a child’s
behaviour (Squires et al., 2002). The current data
from children (N = 13,470) from ages 1-4 on
both questionnaires were extracted from the
original dataset collected by the project.
Demographic information (e.g. family income,
ethnicity) was not collected as it was considered
a burden for preschool teachers to retrieve from
parents. However, due to the preference given
low income families by the State of Rio de
Janeiro Constitution (Constituição do Rio de
Janeiro, 1988), it is likely that participating
families mainly represented low-income
families in the City of Rio de Janeiro. The portion
of low income families in Rio de Janeiro is
23.3%, which is defined as earning less than one
half the minimum wage per month; R$622.00
was the minimum wage in 2012 in Brazil
(Indicadores de Dados Básicos, 2012).

Measures
ASQ:3. The ASQ:3 is a screening instrument for
assessing general development in young children
during the first 5 years of life, composed of a
series of 21 questionnaires at different age
intervals (Squires & Bricker, 2009). Each
interval has five domains: communication, gross
motor, fine motor, problem solving, and
personal-social skills. Each domain has six
items, and each item is scored as “Yes” (10
points), “Sometimes” (5 points), or “Not Yet” (0
points). The items are written at a fourth- to sixthgrade reading level so that most parents are able
to complete the questionnaires independently.
Cut-off scores derived from a normative sample
are used to determine whether a child’s
development appears to be typical (scores above
cut-off), whether there is a need for monitoring
(scores above but near the cut-off), or further

assessment is recommended (scores below cutoff).
ASQ:SE. The ASQ:SE is a screening
instrument for detecting social-emotional
problems during the first 6 years of life, and
includes a series of eight intervals, each targeting
a specific age range (i.e. 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48
and 60 months) with total scored items ranging
from 18 at 6 months to 32 items at 48 and 60
months (Squires et al., 2002). Items ask about a
child’s social-emotional performance such as,
“Can your child settle himself down after periods
of exciting activity?” Three response options are
included (“Often or Always,” “Sometimes,” or
“Rarely or Never”). Answers receive numeric
values reflecting competence (0 points) or
problem behaviours (5 or 10 points). Cut-off
scores derived from a normative sample are used
to determine whether a child’s development
appears to be typical (scores lower cut-off) or
further assessment is recommended (scores
above cut-off).
Brazilian adapted versions. The Brazilian
version of the ASQ:3 and ASQ-SE, called the
ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR, were study
outcome measures. A translation-backtranslation process (International Test
Commission, 2005) was adopted to translate the
ASQ-3 and the ASQ:SE from English to
Portuguese.
Psychometric information. The psychometric
study of Brazilian version of the ASQ:3 is
described in a separate publication (Filgueiras,
Pires, Maissonette & Landeira-Fernandez,

2013). The internal structure, reliability,
invariance across years, and item difficulty of the
Brazilian version of the ASQ:SE was examined
using Rasch Partial Credit Model (Chen et al.,
2017). Cut-off scores for the ASQ-BR and
ASQ:SE-BR have not been determined as yet
because evidence was limited regarding
concurrent validity.

Data Analysis
The present study focused on the relation
between children’s scores of social-emotional
competence and their scores on five domains of
general development for children 1-4 years.
Children were assessed by their preschool
teachers using the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SEBR, completing the age interval corresponding
to each child’s chronological age, as shown in
Table 1. For each age group, descriptive statistics
(e.g. M and SD) were calculated for each of the
five domains of the ASQ-BR, the total scores of
the ASQ:SE-BR, and the two behavioural areas
of the ASQ:SE-BR, Emotion and Sociality, as
suggested by a factorial analysis of the ASQ:SE
(Chen, Filgueiras, Squires & LandeiraFernandez, 2016). Bivariate correlations were
calculated to explore the relation between the
ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR using Pearson r.
Next, multiple regression analyses were
conducted to examine what extent that the five
domains of general development predicted
social-emotional competence. The analysis was
conducted using SPSS Version 18.

Correlation. The correlation between ASQ-BR
domains and ASQ:SE-BR areas and total scores
can be found in Table 3. Scores on all
dimensions of the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SEBR were significantly negatively correlated,
indicating that as children’s ASQ-BR scores

increased, their ASQ:SE-BR scores decreased.
In addition, the correlations between all domains
of the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR Sociality
factor were higher than the correlations between
the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR Emotion
factor across all ages.

developmental domain scores were significantly
stronger than the correlations between Emotion
factor scores and each developmental domain.
For example, there was a statistically significant
difference between gross motor and Emotion
correlations, (r = -0.11) and between gross motor
and Sociality (r = -0.21) on the 12-month group,
using the test suggested by Lee and Preacher
(Lee & Preacher, 2013). The results of the
multiple regression analyses also indicated that
the five domains of the ASQ-BR were more
highly correlated to social competence (27% 39%) than the emotional competence (3% 13%). These findings suggest that ASQ-BR
scores were more strongly associated with the
social dimension of the ASQ:SE-BR (e.g.
expressing intention, peer interaction, exploring
new environment) than with the emotional
dimension (e.g. self-regulation, impulsion, or
depression). Thus, if children receive low scores
(e.g. lower than cut-off or in monitor zone) on the
ASQ-3, their social development may also be at
risk and should be considered for further
evaluation.
When examining four different age groups, any
pattern of association was not identified. That is,
in the regression analyses, the r2 (i.e. the amount
that ASQ:SE-BR scores predicted ASQ-BR
domain scores) did not present a tendency to
increase or decrease with age. Additionally, the
amount that the personal-social domain (i.e. b
value) predicted ASQ:SE-BR scores at 36months (b = -1.06) was higher than at 24-months
(b = - 0.23) and 48-months (b = - 0.38). The
feasibility of explaining current results as part of
chronological processes should be reserved, as
the ASQ-BR and ASQ:SE-BR have unique
items across age intervals, resulting in an
inability to examine the effects of age.
Findings add to the existing literature in three
important ways. First, few programmes and
public policies have addressed issues regarding
development in young children in Brazil
(Filgueiras & Landeira-Fernandez, 2014), so that
studies on early childhood assessments via large
scale data sets are important for establishing a
foundation for provision of care and early
intervention. Second, the results provide solid
information on the relation between the two

translated screening instruments used in public
child daycare centres in Rio de Janeiro.
Meanwhile, the results are also able to inform the
studies about the original English version of the
ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE. Finally, the process of
adapting the Brazilian version of ASQ-3 and
ASQ:SE, which followed specific guidelines
proposed by the International Test Commission
(International Test Commission, 2005), illustrates procedures for future research on adaptation
of measurements for cultural/language groups.

Limitations
There are several limitations in the current study.
First, the lack of cut-off scores for the ASQ-BR
and ASQ:SE-BR limited us in drawing
conclusions from the data concerning children’s
overall developmental status (i.e. risk, developing typically). Second, the completion of the
two measures were based on adult reporting. The
subjectivity of teachers who administrated the
questionnaires cannot be excluded, so that there
is the possibility that teachers who rated children
as having developmental concerns may also
view them as having other behavioural problems.
This study explored the relation between the
ASQ-BR and ASQ:SE-BR and findings
indicated that children’s scores on
communication and personal-social domains are
correlated with social-emotional competence, as
was our hypothesis. Replicating the study with a
longitudinal design might allow for more
understanding of how ASQ-BR domains and
ASQ:SE-BR scores work together over time. A
random sampling with different cultural groups
is also recommended to increase generalizability
across populations, as this sample represented a
specific population in Brazil.

Conclusion
This study described the process of cultural
adaption and translation of the Brazilian versions
of the ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE. Findings from
analysing developmental data from a sample of
13,470 Brazilian preschool children in public

ASQ:SE-BR in children between one and four
years of age, suggesting that the general
developmental screening assessment of infant
and young children should be accompanied with
social-emotional/behavioural
competence,
especially for children at risk for delays due to
environmental factors such as poverty.
Furthermore, ASQ-BR communication and
personal-social domain scores were found to
significantly predict greater concerns for
children’s social-emotional competence as
measured by the ASQ:SE-BR scores. Thus, if
using both screeners at one time is burdensome,
completing the ASQ:SE-BR on children whose
scores fall below the cut-off scores in
communication or personal-social domains is
recommended.
Effective and accurate developmental screening
is critical for early identification of delays and
optimising children’s developmental outcomes.
Preschool teachers from public daycare centres
in Rio de Janeiro were able to complete
questionnaires on children in their care that
yielded important information related to social
emotional and developmental status. Further
research is needed to confirm these results with
diverse populations and to establish cut-off
scores that will assist in streamlining referral and
evaluation processes.
