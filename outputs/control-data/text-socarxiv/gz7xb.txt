STRATEGIC REBELS: A SPATIAL ECONOMETRIC APPROACH TO
REBEL FIGHTING DURATIONS IN CIVIL WARS
NILS W. METTERNICH AND JULIAN WUCHERPFENNIG

Abstract. Recent research on multi-actor civil wars highlights that rebel organizations
condition their conflict behavior on that of other rebel organizations, with competition
and free-riding constituting the core theoretical mechanisms. We provide a new actorcentric approach to explicitly model strategic interdependence in multi-actor civil wars.
We argue that rebel organizations have incentives to remain mobilized until the end of a
conflict to maintain their power to negotiate, power to spoil, power to enforce, and power
to protect. This induces strategic complements that dominate duration dynamics in multiactor conflicts. Based on a network game theoretic model, we derive a spatial econometric
framework that allows for a direct test of strategic interdependence. We find that the
estimated duration interdependence is positive, but partially offset in secessionist conflicts
where the public goods nature of the incompatibility also induces strategic substitution
effects.

Introduction
Historically about half of all civil conflicts involve multiple rebel organizations fighting the
government (Gleditsch et al., 2002; Walter, 2019). These multi-actor settings are consistently
linked to long durations (Cunningham, 2006; Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009),
as well as greater human suffering (Wood and Kathman, 2015), as exemplified by the ongoing
Syrian civil war (Gade, Hafez and Gabbay, 2019).
A key premise in theoretical approaches to such multi-actor conflicts is that the behavior
of rebel organizations is inherently strategic and interdependent (Cunningham, 2006, 2011;

Findley and Rudloff, 2012; Fjelde and Nilsson, 2012; Nygård and Weintraub, 2015; Wood
and Kathman, 2015; Fjelde and Nilsson, 2018; Quinn, Joshi and Melander, 2019). Rebel organizations condition their choice to fight, use one-sided violence, or sign peace-agreements
not only on government behavior, but also on the (expected) behavior of other rebel organizations. This interdependence between actors is not only prominent in the civil war
literature, but also extends to other forms of political violence, such as terrorism (Bloom,
2005; Phillips, 2014; Nemeth, 2014; Conrad and Greene, 2015).
Despite this growing literature on multi-actor conflicts, there is less consensus on how to
theoretically and empirically model strategic relations between multiple actors, and especially
how to draw empirical inferences in the context of interdependent actors. Recent network
approaches are most explicit and address interdependencies between armed actors head-on
(Metternich et al., 2013; König et al., 2017; Gade, Hafez and Gabbay, 2019). We seek to built
upon this work by providing a theoretical and empirical model of how multi-actor conflicts
induce strategic behavior, focusing on the fighting durations of armed actors.
By focusing on strategic interdependencies of fighting durations, we address an important
limitation in the study of civil wars. While the onset, escalation, and outcome of civil
wars have seen efforts to model the interdependency between rebel organizations explicitly,
scholarly contributions to study of fighting durations have tended to model interdependency
only implicitly. Explicit approaches attempt to model dependency of actors directly by
using network analytic or spatial statistical approaches to infer patterns of interdependency
by fully endogenizing interdependent outcomes, while implicit approaches focus on variables
that proxy the degree to which interdependency impacts on actors’ decisions. Indeed, most
scholars analyzing fighting durations in civil wars follow the implicit approach suggested by
the seminal work of Cunningham (2006), who includes the number of armed actors in a
conflict as a covariate intended to capture strategic dependence that arises from veto player
dynamics.

Our focus on fighting durations allows us to make two contributions. First, we present
a theoretical framework that highlights the incentives rebel organizations face to remain
mobilized until the end of a conflict. Second, we propose a spatial econometric estimation
framework that allows us to directly test the empirical implications of theories that assume
strategic interactions between rebel organizations.
Our theoretical framework highlights rebel organizations’ incentives to remain mobilized
until the end of the conflict. These incentives arise because mobilized rebel organizations
can maintain their ability to enter negotiations ((i) power to negotiate) or influence their
outcome from the outside ((ii) power to spoil). Even groups that are granted or offered
government concessions before the end of a conflict have incentives to remain mobilized to
circumvent commitment problems ((iii) power to enforce) and protect their supporters from
the government of other rebel organizations while the conflict is still ongoing ((iv) power
to protect). Together, this implies that fighting durations in multi-actor conflicts become
strategic complements. However, where conflict incompatibilities entail a strong public goods
aspect or conflict parties can enter binding agreements, strategic substitution effects between
rebel organizations can offset strategic complementarity. We argue that secessionist conflicts
are especially prone to observe strategic substitution effects, where all rebel organizations
can benefit from a potential new and independent state.
Our statistical approach accounts for endogenous rebel fighting durations due to simultaneity arising from interdependent decision-making. We develop a statistical model that not
only ‘controls’ for duration of other rebel organizations, but fully endogenizes rebel organizations’ fighting durations, even when these decisions are strategically interdependent across
actors. Our spatial econometric approach allows us examine the extent of strategic interaction between rebel organizations. We find evidence for the argument that rebel organizations
generally engage in competitive behavior, attempting to outperform one another by means
of longer fighting. In line with the literature, we refer to such positive interdependence as
strategic complementarity in outcomes (Franzese and Hays, 2008). However, in separatist
conflicts, where public goods considerations can be expected to be more pronounced, we find
3

that competition dynamics are partially offset by negative interdependence through incentives to free-ride (strategic substitution). Finally, we show that strategic interaction is not
merely a statistical nuisance and that taking full account of it improves our ability to explain
and predict rebel fighting durations.

Conflict Duration and Multiple Actors
A burgeoning literature has addressed the interdependency of armed actors in conflicts.
This scholarship on multiple actor conflicts generally falls into two strands: (1) studies
that see rebel fighting as strategic complements (rebel competition and fragmentation), and
(2) those that view it as strategic substitutes (rebel cooperation and alliances). While
Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan (2009, 572) already suggested that rebels at times fight
each other more often than the government, this idea is investigated in more detail by Fjelde
and Nilsson (2012) who argue that competition over material and political spoils triggers
inter-rebel violence. Similarly, focusing on fragmentation in self-determination disputes,
Cunningham, Bakke and Seymour (2012) highlight that faction leaders also seek control of
private and club goods, which drives competition.
However, as pointed out by these authors, fighting the government frequently entails not
only public good, but also private good aspects (Fjelde and Nilsson, 2012; Cunningham,
Bakke and Seymour, 2012). Bapat and Bond (2012) identify specific conditions under which
rebel organizations overcome commitment problems and form alliances. Similarly, Christia
(2012) analyses how power distributions within alliances lead to their fragmentation and
continued fighting when small power-shifts can induce changes in the order of power relationships. In a more optimistic take on alliances within movements, Bakke, Cunningham
and Seymour (2012) argue that increased institutionalization increases cohesion between
groups by providing non-violent mechanisms that mitigate conflict among groups. Similarly,
Akcinaroglu (2012) suggests that credible alliances with strong ties increase the chances of

theory and empirical model. Gray dots pertain to the government, black dots
to rebel organizations. Arrows describe assumed strategic interdependence
between actors. In a purely actor based approach, the utility of continuing
to fight is simply a function of actor specific characteristics (X). A dyadic
approach focuses on the interaction between the a rebel organization and a
government, where the decision of a rebel organization to fight depends on
dyadic features Z and actor characteristics X. In a constellation approach,
the rebel-government relationship is conditioned by constellation features K
(e.g. number of actors), but rebels do not strategically condition their behavior
on other rebel-government dyads. In a strategic approach, all rebels condition
their behavior Y on all other rebels’ observed and expected behavior Y they
are connected to through W .

rebel victories. Applying a computational perspective, Findley and Rudloff (2012) demonstrate that fragmentation of rebel organizations can actually decrease fighting durations,
thus contrasting to insights from Cunningham (2006).
It is apparent from this discussion that the theoretical literature readily acknowledges
the importance of strategic interaction between rebel organizations (cf. Cunningham, 2006;
Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009; Fjelde and Nilsson, 2012; Cunningham, Bakke
and Seymour, 2012; Cunningham, 2013). Most prominent theoretical arguments, e.g. the
veto player approach Cunningham (2006), are fundamentally strategic approaches in which
actors condition their behavior on the observed and expected behavior of all other actors. In
Table 1, strategic theories condition the choice of rebel organizations not only on actor and
5

dyad specific characteristics, but on the expected and observed behavior of all other dyads
in a conflict.
However, while the empirical study of civil war onset, escalation, and termination has
made great strides to address the strategic dependency explicitly,1 observational studies of
fighting durations tend to use implicit measures of dependency. This is because most studies focusing on fighting durations employ conventional statistical tools that assume rebel
organizations to be de facto independent. More precisely, conventional duration estimators
(e.g. parametric duration models) assume that the stochastic error terms are sampled conditionally independent (iid assumption). While almost all fighting duration studies attempt
account for strategic interdependence by including the number of rebel organizations involved
in a conflict (the constellation approach in Table 1), we argue that this does not capture
the theoretically implied data-generating process and might even lead to incorrect parameter estimates and inference.2 This problem arises because strategic interaction squarely
implies that actions (outcomes) by other actors (or expectations thereof) need to appear
as endogenous right-hand side variables (Franzese and Hays, 2008; Hays and Kachi, 2015;
Hays, 2009). By contrast, approaches that focus on exogenous structural constellations omit
these actions taken by other actors altogether. Based on these considerations, we aim to reframe the debate. Rather than examining the effects of particular constellations, we ask how
the decision of one rebel organization to endure fighting affects that of other organizations,
and—importantly—vice-versa.

The logic of enduring fighting: A theoretical Model of

awareness to these interdependencies have been addressed not only by network

approaches (e.g. Metternich et al., 2013; König et al., 2017; Gade, Hafez and Gabbay, 2019),
but also random effect models (see Cunningham and Sawyer, 2017)
2Note that because coefficients will be biased, clustering standard errors will not solve
this problem, i.e., incorrect inference will prevail. See also Poast (2010).

Fighting Durations
When should a rebel organizations lay down their weapons? This question is at the heart
of determining the fighting duration of rebel organizations. We argue that in multi-actor
conflicts there are clear incentives to match the fighting durations of other rebel organizations
and remain mobilized until the end of a conflict. We argue that these incentives make
multi-actor conflicts particularly long and add to the already established bargaining issues
(Cunningham, 2006; Gallop, 2017) in these types of conflicts. We argue that incentives to
match fighting durations can be attributed to four mechanisms, all of which maximize a
rebel organization’s ability to shape the post-conflict aftermath. These are the: (i) power to
negotiate, (ii) power to spoil, (iii) power to enforce, and (iv) power to protect.

Power to negotiate. The simplest path to shaping the institutions and divisions of spoils after
the conflict has ended is to sit at the bargaining table when peace negotiations take place. A
key to taking part in these negotiations is to be mobilized, exert violence, and constitute a
potent threat to the government (Clayton, 2013; Thomas, 2014). Alternatively, if the rebels
manage to defeat the government, similar negotiations typically take place among those
organizations that remained active until the end of the conflict, i.e. those that were able to
claim victory.

Power to spoil. However, in many conflicts, a subset of rebel organizations remains precluded
from peace negotiations due to perceived weakness or other ideological issues. For such
groups the incentives to stay mobilized as long as possible is to undermine negotiations from
the outside through their ability to spoil negotiations in the hope of sitting at the bargaining
table at a later time (Stedman, 1997; Findley and Young, 2015).

Power to enforce. Rebel organizations receive offers by the government or competing rebel
organizations to cease their activity. However, accepting such cooptation is risky. Indeed,
there are incentives for, e.g., the government to renege on offers during the conflict and
before these ‘contracts’ are enshrined in post-conflict institutions (Walter, 1999). Therefore
7

rebel organizations have incentives to remain mobilized at low levels of fighting to ensure
that they can enforce any pre-conflict termination agreement (Fearon, 2004).

Power to protect. Finally, as conflict generates grievances, including desire for revenge (Petersen, 2002), there are incentives for rebel organizations to remain mobilized in order to
protect their constituencies in times of armed conflict. Thus, even if a rebel organization
ceases their offensive activities, there are incentives to remain mobilized, at least until the
overall fighting has stopped, and protect their respective followers or constituencies from
potential reprisals by the government or rivaling rebel organizations (Wucherpfennig et al.,
2012).
These mechanism highlight that long durations not necessarily imply high intensity fighting.3 In fact, there might be environments that are more conducive to enable rebel organizations’ long survival times at low intensity levels (e.g. weak governments).

Fighting durations as strategic complements. We now turn to formalizing these conjectures. The incentives to stay mobilized until the end of conflict imply that rebel organizations will strategically condition their choice to lay down arms on the choices of all other
active rebel organizations. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that when rebel organizations
enter a conflict they already condition their expectation about the duration of fighting on
the fighting duration of all other actors and adapt their fighting strategies accordingly. This
dynamic of attempting stay mobilized as long as all other rebel organization leads to strategic
complements of fighting.
We draw on recent work analyzing the provision of local public goods (Bramoullé and
Kranton, 2007; Galeotti et al., 2010; Bramoullé, Kranton and D’Amours, 2014; Siegel,
2009; Metternich et al., 2013; Steinwand, 2011). Using the analytic framework provided
by Bramoullé, Kranton and D’Amours (2014), we formalize these considerations in a simple

model that assumes N rebel organizations in conflict with the government. Each organization i remains active for certain amount of time yi ≥ 0 to retain their (i) power to negotiate,
(ii) power to spoil, (iii) power to enforce, and (iv) power to protect.
In a multi-actor setting it is possible to take a network perspective to describe how rebel
organization i’s fighting duration impacts on other organizations j’s fighting duration and
therefore their (i) power to negotiate, (ii) power to spoil, (iii) power to enforce, and (iv)
power to protect. Whether i is impacted by j’s decision to continue fighting depends on
whether they are connected in an N × N matrix W, where wij is the element in the ith row
and jth column. Thus, if wij = 1, i’s (i) power to negotiate, (ii) power to spoil, (iii) power to
enforce, and (iv) power to protect are directly impacted by j’s fighting duration. Given that
fighting is costly, the extent to which i experiences negative externalities from j’s fighting
duration depends on a parameter γ ∈ [0, 1) which denotes the complementarity between i’s
fighting duration and other rebels in the conflict. The greater γ the less i benefits from j’s
fighting duration in regard to i’s a) power to negotiate, b) power to spoil, c) power to enforce,
and d) power to protect. The utility of an individual rebel organization can therefore be
written as:

!
(1)

Ui (yi , yj , γ, W) = bi

yi − γ

X

wij yj

− ci y i

j

Here, bi is a differentiable benefit function that is strictly increasing and concave in yi , i.e.,
b(0) = 0, b0 = 0 and b00 < 0. We also assume that each organization incurs some marginal
cost ci > 0 per unit of fighting duration, such that b0 (0) > ci > b0 (+∞).
Assuming that each rebel organization i has a fighting duration ȳi that it is willing to
sustain fighting the government alone (i.e. idiosyncratic fighting duration), the best response
of this model implies that yi∗ increases as the efforts of other rebel organizations increase.
This gives rise to competitive dynamics between rebel organizations.
(2)

yi∗ = ȳi + γ

From this best response, we can derive our main empirical expectation of positive interdependence. Thus, the longer rebel organization j fights the longer rebel organization i fights
to retain their (i) power to negotiate, (ii) power to spoil, (iii) power to enforce, and (iv)
power to protect.

Alternative Argument: Fighting durations as strategic substitutes. Our four mechanisms that drive strategic complementarity assume that rebel organizations are in an environment that impedes binding agreements and/or is characterized by low levels of trust.
Actors with different interest are therefore incentivized to stay mobilized until the end of
the conflict. However, this also implies that if actors have completely aligned preferences
about generating particular public goods after the fighting stops or have a higher capacity to enter binding agreements, strategic substitution effects should offset or counteract
complementarity dynamics.
Indeed, there are good arguments that particular conflicts, in which all actors share the
same interests and trust other rebel organization to implement their preferred post-conflict
institutions and division of spoils, can lead to actors deciding to lay down their arms before
the conflict has ended. For example, in secessionist conflicts, rebel organizations share the
objective of a newly independent state, which has strong characteristics of a public good.
In other words, some conflict incompatibilities, such as gaining independence, are to a large
extent non-excludable and non-rivalrous (cf. Olson, 1965; Cunningham, Bakke and Seymour,
2012; Metternich et al., 2013).
The non-excludability and non-rivalry of public goods give rise to free-riding and collective
action problems (Olson, 1965). Such problems are well identified in civil wars, including that
of individual-level rebel recruitment (Lichbach, 1995; Gates, 2002; Wood, 2003), but they
also exist between rebel organizations. For example, secessionist victories not only benefit
the main rebel organizations, but also all other anti-government organizations (cf. Schnytzer,
1994). As Collier (2000, 98) puts it: “Justice, revenge, and relief from grievance are “public
goods” and so are subject to free-riding.”
10

Again we can take a network perspective to formalize these dynamics. Substitution effects
arise because i enjoys positive externalities from j’s (i) power to negotiate, (ii) power to
spoil, (iii) power to enforce, or (iv) power to protect. For example, this is the case if j’s
power to negotiate will lead to an outcome that benefits i’. The degree to which i benefits
from j’s fighting duration depends on a parameter δ ∈ [0, 1) which denotes the extent of
substitutability between i’s fighting duration and those of her neighbors. The utility of an
individual rebel organization can therefore be written as:
!
Ui (yi , yj , δ, W) = bi

(3)

yi + δ

X

− ci y i

wij yj

j

Following Bramoullé, Kranton and D’Amours (2014), the best response function for every
rebel organization i in this game is:4

The best response given in Eq. 4 follows the simple intuition that rebel organization i will
endure fighting yi∗ that ensures that its willingness of sustained fighting ȳi is generated given
its neighbors’ fighting durations. If its neighbors underprovide, i makes up the difference, and
no contribution otherwise. Eq. 4 highlights that in the absence of strategic independence
(δ = 0 in Eq. 4), individual fighting durations are solely dependent on the characteristics
of a given rebel organization. However, if we allow rebel organizations to benefit from the
fighting durations of other organizations (implied by δ > 0 in Eq. 3), rebel organizations
can achieve their optimal fighting duration ȳi by free-riding on others’ fighting efforts.

Towards an Empirical Model of Strategic Duration Interdependence
In this section we combine the logics of strategic complementarity and strategic substitution so as to allow for an empirical model. As previously pointed out, Cunningham, Bakke
and Seymour (2012) argue that complementarity and substitution logics can operate at the
same time. Hence, we provide an extended model that can account for both fighting durations as substitutes and complements, which will allow us to derive an estimation approach
to assess whether strategic complements or substitutes are on average more dominant in
fighting duration dynamics. Accounting for both strategic complements or substitutes, we
can combine Equation 1 and 3:

!
(5)

Ui (yi , yj , δ, γ, W) = bi

yi + δ

X

wij yj − γ

j

X

wij yj

− ci y i

j

In line with Cunningham, Bakke and Seymour (2012), the full model highlights that
incentives for free-riding and competition can exist simultaneously, precisely because the
terms for δ and γ differ merely in sign, thus potentially offsetting each other. Hence, only
the net effect of the two can be observed, and given our framework we can observe whether
the free-riding or competition logic prevails. Thus, we simplify as follows:
!
X
(6)
Ui (yi , yj , ρ, W) = bi yi + ρ
wij yj − ci yi
j

where ρ = δ − γ. Note that ρ ∈ (−1, 1). Moreover, the best response function for every rebel
organization i is:5
yi∗ = ȳi + ρ

(7)

This best response implies that depending on the whether the public goods or the rivalry
mechanism prevails, rebel organizations will have incentives to decrease or increase their

individual contribution. Substantively, if ρ > 0 in Eq. 7, competitive dynamics dominate, if
ρ < 0 free-riding dominates. To illustrate and summarize the substantive interpretation, in
Figure 1 we visualize some comparative statics for different values of ρ.
We consider a scenario with four rebel organizations, i = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Optimal (idiosyncratic) fighting durations (that each rebel organization were to inflict upon the government
if it was alone in the conflict) are set to ȳi = {10, 20, 30} for i = {1, 2, 3}. The x-axis
represents organization 4’s idiosyncratic fighting durations, while the y-axis denotes the optimal (equilibrium) effect6 for each organization. The left panel shows a baseline scenario
and highlights that in the absence interdependence (ρ = 0), the equilibrium fighting durations of all players remains identical to their idiosyncratic fighting durations. The middle
panel considers the case of positive interdependence (ρ = .1), i.e. when fighting efforts are
strategic complements. As rebel organization 4’s ȳ4 increases from 10 to 30, the other organizations’ (optimal) fighting efforts increase as well. The right panel highlights the reverse
effect (ρ = −.1), and demonstrates decreasing incentives to contribute as ȳ4 increases (i.e.
free-riding).

Spatial Econometric Approach
In this section we draw on spatial econometrics and present an empirical strategy to estimate best responses as given in equation 7. Our theoretical considerations imply that
rebel actions are partly determined through mutual interdependence where each rebel organization considers the (expected) behavior of her neighbors, and vice versa. This implies
strategic interdependence and consequently, the outcome of interest—fighting durations—
simultaneously represents an explanatory factor. This induces a particular endogeneity problem (bias) which cannot be accommodated by standard estimation techniques, or by simply
introducing exogenous spatial lags as a conventional explanatory variable.
As highlighted above, y appears on both sides of the equation, which implies an endogeneity problem due to simultaneity. In the absence of an adequate estimator, this leads to a
violation of the statistical assumption of independent units and uncorrelated error terms. A
prominent solution to this problem is the estimation of spatial econometric models (Franzese
and Hays, 2008). This class of estimators is designed to account for, and estimate the degree of, interdependence between units, and has only recently reached the mainstream of
political science (Ward and Gleditsch, 2002; Cho, 2003; Simmons and Elkins, 2004; Beck,
Gleditsch and Beardsley, 2006; Gleditsch and Ward, 2006; Franzese and Hays, 2007). In the
context of civil war, spatial econometrics have been used to assess the economic effect of
civil wars on neighboring countries (Murdoch and Sandler, 2004), the effect refugees have on
civil war onset (Salehyan, 2007), clustering of civil wars (Buhaug and Gleditsch, 2008), and
transnational factors influencing civil war onset (Gleditsch, 2007). Spatial interdependence
is commonly equated with aspects of geography, such as proximity or contiguity. However, as Beck, Gleditsch and Beardsley (2006) and Franzese and Hays (2008) elaborate, in
principle there is no reason to restrict the operationalization of interdependence to physical
distance and we use spatial econometrics, spatial duration analysis in particular, to model
the strategic interdependence between rebel organizations within multi-actor conflicts.

14

Interdependent durations. We are interested in the fighting durations of rebel organizations and hence our estimation approach is based on event history models. Models of interdependent duration are rare in political science and in the context of armed conflict we are
only aware of one study focusing on duration dependence within WWI (Hays, Schilling and
Boehmke, 2015). Applications from other subfields include Quiroz Flores (2008) estimating
the tenure of chief executive officers and the median duration of their ministers as interdependent using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimator. Darmofal (2009) uses a
spatial-error approach to estimate issue position taking on NAFTA in the U.S. Congress.
Our approach builds on spatial duration estimators developed by Hays and Kachi (2015)
and Hays (2009). In our context, an additional challenge arises because fighting durations
of rebel organizations do not necessarily have the same start date. They are frequently nonaligned over the length of the conflict and as a consequence the set of strategically dependent
rebel organizations varies across time. Our estimation framework explicitly addresses these
dynamics.
Consider a standard parametric event history model, such as a Weibull or log-normal event
history model. This can be written in accelerated failure time (AFT) form as follows:
(8)

1
y = Xβ + u,
λ

where y is the logged time until failure (i.e. duration), X is a vector of covariates, and u is the
stochastic error, scaled by a shape parameter λ that denotes the shape of the baseline hazard.
Since u is assumed to be i.i.d., given some distribution, it follows that such a model will lead
to biased estimates when the observations are not sampled independently of one another.
This is in contrast to our theoretical model where the fighting duration of rebel organization
yi depends on the fighting durations of all other organizations yj6=i , and vice-versa.
As shown by Hays and Kachi (2015), if information about the interdependence structure
is available, it is possible to overcome the independence assumption for event history models

15

by introducing an endogenous spatial lag:
1
y = ρWy + Xβ + u,
λ

(9)

where W is an n × n connectivity matrix that specifies dependencies between pairs of rebel
organizations. Assuming that the interdependence follows a monotonic functional form, ρ
provides an estimate of the interdependence between rebel organizations. Due to its analogy
in the time-series analysis, this type of model is referred to as a spatial lag or spatially
autoregressive model (SAR). Appendix A derives the maximum likelihood estimator based
on the reduced form y = (I − ρW)−1 (Xβ + λ1 u). We emphasize that an endogenous spatial
lag accommodated by this estimator ‘solves’ for simultaneity in rebel behavior and their
ability to form expectations about future behavior. By contrast, if we simply introduced the
spatial lagged term as a right hand side variable in standard (non-spatial) estimator, this
would assume non-simultaneous behavior that is inconsistent with the notion of strategic
interdependence, and only conditions on past behavior. Put differently, if actors behave
strategically, the naı̈ve, non-simultaneous estimator will yield biased inferences.
Non-aligned interdependent durations. The introduced spatial duration model is perfectly suitable in instances where all rebel organizations enter their respective conflicts at
the same time, implying that all organizations were active from the beginning of the conflict.
However, empirically this is not the case and it is common that rebel organizations join the
fighting at later stages of a conflict and/or end their fighting efforts early. These dynamics make it necessary to adapt the above estimator (Hays and Kachi, 2015; Hays, 2009) to
accommodate non-aligned duration through a specific setup of the connectivity matrix W.7
In addressing non-aligned interdependent fighting durations, we first rank-order all rebel
organizations according to their date of entry. Therefore, i = {1, . . . , N } becomes a rank
indicator, such that i = 1 is the first mover, i = 2 is the second mover, until the nth mover.
7A

further obstacle originates from the fact that these models cannot easily deal with

censored observations. Our proposed solution avoids dealing with censoring (or TVCs for
that matter), and relies on non-censored observations only.

Again, let yi denote the fighting duration of rebel organizations, whereas zi indicates the conflict entry time, that is the time since the start of the conflict until rebel organization i enters.

Figure 2. Non-Aligned fighting durations in a hypothetical conflict with four
rebel organizations. The fighting durations of each individual rebel organization yi are represented as black bars, while the time until entering the conflict
zi is illustrated by grey bars. Rebel organizations are rank-ordered by their
date of entrance.
The main assumption in the theoretical model is that rebel organizations have expectations
about the behavior of other active organizations. This implies that the first mover has
expectations about the fighting durations of all subsequent rebel organizations entering the
conflict:
(10)

y1 ∝

j=2

The second-mover, however, conditions her fighting duration on (1) how much longer
she expects the first-mover organization to continue fighting, and (2) the expected fighting
durations of subsequent movers. In other words, she considers the full durations of rebel
organizations i = 3...N , but only the part of the fighting duration of the first-mover that
extends beyond her own entering time z2 . Formally this implies:

Having specified the connectedness of individual fighting durations, we can construct an
appropriate connectivity matrix W and derive our full model. Since our endogenous spatial
lag not just involves fighting times but also conflict entry times, we follow a setup that
resembles that of simultaneous equations. The resulting model can be thought of as a
hybrid between a standard spatial and a simultaneous equation model. Note, however, that
our estimator does not rely on instrumental variables, as we estimate only one equation.
Rather, we show that the interdependence as given in Equation 12 can be constructed in
matrix form through such a setup. The construction of the respective W matrix can be
found in the Appendix.

Data
Our empirical analysis is based on the Non-State Actors in Intra-State Conflicts Dataset
(NSA version 3.4) (Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009, 2013), which identifies rebel
organizations that have been involved in armed conflicts with at least 25 casualties in a
calender year. The NSA data set builds upon the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Data
(Gleditsch et al., 2002) and generates a population of 477 government-rebel dyads from 1946
through 2011. Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan (2009) focus on rebel organizations that
were clearly active in fighting and have a distinct leadership structure. Based on their dyad
indicators, we generate a start and end date for each conflict dyad. To accommodate our
statistical estimator we drop all right-censored cases, leaving us with 327 unique governmentrebel dyads, with some appearing multiple times during a conflict. This creates 379 unique
observations. The data set also provides conflict IDs, which we use to construct our connectivity matrix W, i.e. assuming that rebel organizations that are simultaneously active
in the same conflict potentially exhibit strategic interdependence. Our sample includes 153
18

distinct conflicts, 72 of which are comprised of more than one rebel organization during their
duration.
Outcome variable: Fighting time. In our empirical analysis we distinguish between the
fighting time and the conflict entry time of rebel organizations. The dependent variable
fighting time is the period in which a rebel organization actively takes part in the armed
conflict. Given our operationalization of interdependent outcomes (see Equation 12), conflict
entry time is also required and is defined as the time until a rebel organization joins the armed
conflict. Thus, through the spatial lag, conflict entry time is also an outcome variable, but
is treated as exogenous. This assumption allows us to enter waiting as an explanatory
variable to account for the timing of conflict entry.8 Fighting and conflict entry times of
rebel organizations are measured in calendar time, i.e. days. The conflict entry time for the
first rebel group is always zero.9
Control variables. While the time until entry is one measure to evaluate the effect first or
late movers have on fighting durations, we also control for the actual ordering of entry into
the conflict. Hence, we generate a variable that simply orders rebel organizations by their
respective entry time from one to the number of overall rebel organizations ever appearing
in a conflict.
In our model specification, we also include a number of variables that scholars associate
with the fighting durations of rebel organizations and that might be important confounders
or drivers of strategic interdependence. Most importantly, the veto player theory proposed
by Cunningham (2006) suggests that conflicts characterized by multiple actors tend to last
8Ideally

we would endogenize both waiting and fighting times through simultaneous equa-

tions (see Hays and Kachi (2015)). However, to do so we require suitable instruments for
identification, i.e. at least one variable that is associated with either outcome, but not the
other. Unfortunately, we are not able to plausibly identify such a variable. This implies that
our results, in this regard, are vulnerably to potential endogeneity concerns.
9To accommodate the log specification (which does not allow for values of zero) we added
one day to each conflict entry time. Choosing even smaller values did not alter the results.
19

longer. While we believe that measuring the number of actors in a conflict merely measures constellations rather than strategic interactions, we include the number of active rebel
organizations for each rebel organization at their respective time of entrance.
Following Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan (2009), we control for a number of rebel
strength measures. We include a dummy of whether the rebel organizations are able to
control territory, which is generally associated with shorter conflicts (Cunningham, Gleditsch
and Salehyan, 2009). Additionally, we indicate whether a rebel organization has a legal
political wing (Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009). We interpret a legal political
wing as a proxy for public support and political power of the rebel organization.
Fighting dynamics are likely to be dependent on state characteristics such as military
power, political institutions, and geographic characteristics. In order to address these relatively constant state characteristics we include country dummy variables in all our models.
This also has the advantage that we do not need to impute missing information on state
strength (e.g. GDP per capita) or military strength (e.g. troop numbers).
We also include indicators of whether rebel organizations are splinter groups or are part of
an over-arching alliance, accounting for particular dynamics that might be associated with
fragmentation and coalition behavior (Bakke, Cunningham and Seymour, 2012; Akcinaroglu,
2012; Christia, 2012). We code splinter and alliance characteristics based on the UCDP
actor data (Petterson and Themnér, 2012) coding and using UCDP dyadic data to link this
information (Harbom, Melander and Wallensteen, 2008). Finally, we account for the fact
that previous conflict outcomes are argued to impact on future conflict behavior (Walter,
2004; Chiba, Metternich and Ward, 2015) and that the incompatibility of conflict, especially
secessionist conflicts, affect conflict duration. Summary statistics for all variables can be
found in the Appendix, Table B2.

Results and Interpretation
In this section we report our empirical results. These generally support our theoretical
argument about positive interdependence (competition) among rebel organizations’ fighting
20

times. However, in secessionist conflicts, where the conflict incompatibility has public good
characteristics, such complementarities in rebel fighting durations are partially offset through
a substitution logic, i.e. free-riding.
We compare estimates and fit from a conventional (non-strategic) model to those of our
spatial (strategic) estimator. Based on AIC comparisons, we find that the Weibull distribution provides a best fit to the data (alternative distributional assumptions are presented
in the appendix; substantive results remain unchanged); hence we report results for Weibull
models. All models are estimated in the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) form. Thus, positive coefficients imply that higher values of an independent variable increase the fighting
duration of a rebel-government dyad, while negative estimates indicate that higher values
of a variable are related to shorter fighting durations. The significance of each estimate is
assessed by two-tailed tests.
Main results. We provide our main findings in Table 2. Our discussion focuses on the
findings regarding interdependence and strategic interaction between rebel organizations.
(We briefly comment on the results from the covariates below.)
We first estimate a (standard) non-strategic Weibull model which does not account for
the interdependence between the rebel organizations, but includes the commonly used ‘veto’
variable measuring the number of other rebel organizations active at the beginning of a
government-rebel episode. In line with previous findings (Cunningham, 2006), we find that
higher numbers of active rebel organizations increase the fighting duration of rebel organizations. We then estimate the same model with our spatial Weibull duration estimator and
initially exclude the ‘veto’ variable. This model explicitly addresses strategic (spatial) interdependence through the spatial parameter ρ – which is positive and fairly precise, indicating
a positive interdependence between rebel organizations’ fighting duration. This provides initial support for our theoretical argument that fighting durations are strategic complements.
In other words, increased fighting durations of one rebel organization leads to longer fighting
spells of others. Moreovoer, given an identical number of estimated parameters, the lower
AIC and BIC values in the spatial compared to the standard model suggest an improved fit.

The third model is again a spatial Weibull model, but also includes the ‘veto’ variable.
The estimates suggest that interdependency between rebel organizations is better captured
through the spatial framework, as compared to simply accounting for the constellation in the
conflict. In fact, controlling for the number of veto players in a spatial Weibull model leaves us
with almost the same estimate for ρ, but with a small but negative (and imprecise) estimate
for the number of active rebel organizations. Accounting for the strategic interdependence
even reverses the sign for the effect of the total number of rebel organizations (i.e. veto
players). However, this does not necessarily refute the theoretical foundation of the veto
player perspective (Cunningham, 2006). The veto player theory is inherently strategic and it
is therefore likely that our endogenous spatial lag (also) captures these effects. In addition,
any non-linearity in the effect of the number of veto players on conflict duration could
22

be partially captured by duration dependence between rebel organizations. Overall, the
results supports our argument that it is indeed strategic interaction between actors rather
than simply configurations that drive conflict duration in multi-actor civil wars. This result
should encourage future research on multi-party conflicts to account not only for the number
of actors but the endogenous nature of strategic interaction.
To further corroberate the strategic logic, we explicitly compare conflicts with incompatibilities that (also) incentivize substitution effects which we expect to (partially) offset
strategic competition. Thus, we estimate two additional models for which we split the sample
between separatist and non-separatist conflicts. We find that strategic interdependence (ρ)
remains positive and significant in non-secessionist conflicts, while the coefficient is nearly
zero in secessionist conflicts, suggesting that incentives to free-ride at least in part offset
incentives for competition.10
We also comment on the control variables. Rebel organizations with a political wing affiliated to them experience shorter dyad durations. Organizations within secessionist conflicts
tend to fight longer. While the actual timing of entry does not seem to impact fighting durations, we do find evidence that the ordering does matter. We find that early movers seem to
fight longer than late movers. Previous victories of a government increase fighting durations,
which might point to a particular type of rebel organization that fights previously successful
governments. Alliances also seem to fight shorter durations, which might be related to the
strength of alliances or simply the fact that they form later on in conflict. Splinter groups
do not exhibit such a clear empirical pattern, which could be contributed to the coding of
UCDP alliances and splintering, which requires a fairly formal statement of joining or separation. Hence, many dynamics that are implied in the existing literature on rebel alliances
and fragmentation (e.g., Bakke, Cunningham and Seymour, 2012) are probably not fully
captured by this measure.

10Testing

for the difference between coefficients according to Clogg, Petkova and Haritou

(1995), we also find no difference between the two estimated ρs
23

In sum, we find consistent support for our hypothesis of positive duration interdependence
between rebel organizations. This suggests that multi-actor constellations matter because of
strategic dynamics that arise between rebel organizations, not because such constellations are
more difficult to resolve per se. In other words, our results bolster the strategic perspective
through a more direct test of the full extent of strategic dynamics that is implied in, e.g.,
Cunningham (2006), Akcinaroglu (2012), or Cunningham (2013), but not adequately tested
through measures of mere constellations.

Model fit evaluation. We further investigate our findings by comparing the naı̈ve (nonstrategic) Weibull model (Model 1) with the spatial (strategic) Weibull model (Model 3)
in regard to their ability to predict fighting durations. At first glance the distributions of
predicted durations of the naı̈ve (orange) and spatial (purple) do not seem to differ much
(see Figure 3 panel (a)) and slightly over-predict observed durations (black line) on average.
However, looking at the relative advantage of the respective models in predicting durations
(see Figure 3 panel (b)), we can uncover an interesting pattern. The non-strategic Weibull
model (Model 1) outperforms the strategic Weibull model (Model 3) when predicting shorter
fighting durations, while the strategic Weibull model (Model 3) is closer to the observed
values when rebel organizations fight for a longer period of time.
On average, the strategic Weibull model (Model 3) outperforms the non-strategic Weibull
model (Model 3) when calculating the root mean squared error for the naı̈ve (RSME =
1796.92) and the spatial (RSME = 1714.01) model. In addition, when scoring which model
is closer to the observed duration (Figure 3c), the spatial model has a clear advantage
compared to the naı̈ve model. We also analyze the absolute difference of the observed and
estimated durations, which can be found in the Appendix. In conclusion, there seems to
be a pattern that the spatial model especially outperforms the naı̈ve model, when rebel
organizations fight for more than 10 years (about 10 percent or rebel organization spells)
(Figure 3b). This provides further evidence that the spatial model accounts for duration
dynamics that are not captured by the non-strategic estimation approach.

Secessionist vs. non-secessionist conflicts. To provide further support for the argument that the endogenous spatial effect ρ is evidence for fighting durations as strategic
complements, we analyze differences between secessionist and non-secessionist conflicts. We
argued in the theoretical section that conflicts with incompatibilities that feature more public
good characteristics (such as secessionist conflicts) should be increasingly driven by substitution effects. Using the secessionist conflict type coding from the Non-State Actor dataset
(Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009), we split the sample into rebel organizations
involved in secessionist and non-secessionist conflicts.
Comparing model fit of the secessionist and non-secessionist conflicts, despite a smaller
and less precise ρ in the secessionist model (Model 4 in Table 2) than in the non-secessionist
model (Model 5 in Table 2), model fit is better in the spatial strategic model compared to
the naı̈ve non-strategic model (estimates for the non-strategic versions of the secessionist
and non-secessionist model can be found in the Appendix Table B3). The RMSE improves
in both the secessionist and non-secessionist conflict sample when estimating the spatial
strategic model (see panels c and f in Figure 4). In the non-secessionist sample the spatial
model provides a prediction closer to the observed fighting duration in 142 out of 272 episodes
(0.52%) and in the secessionist sample outperforms the naı̈ve non-strategic model in 65
out of 107 episodes (0.61%). The model predictions differ in regard to the length of rebel

organization fighting spells. The non-secessionist models display similar properties as the
pooled model, in the sense that long durations are better predicted by the spatial strategic
model, while short rebel organization episodes are slightly better predicted by the naı̈ve nonstrategic model (see Figure 4b). This pattern cannot be observed in the secessionist sample
(see Figure 4e).

The long run effect of interdependence. To better assess the extent to which the interdependence between rebel organizations actually impacts on fighting durations, we simulate
26

the long run effects of the spatial dependence. Without these comparative statics it is difficult to gauge the extent to which the estimated ρ coefficient impacts the overall fighting
dynamics. To simulate long run effect of ρ we take the estimated coefficients from Model 3
(Table 2) and fix all explanatory variables at their median values. We then consider a hypothetical conflict with four strategic rebel organizations that start fighting in the same time
period. We implement the data generating process of the spatial Weibull (see Appendix)
and draw from this process 10, 000 times to assess differences in the median duration under
three scenarios (ρ = {−0.1, 0, 0.1}). The first scenario, ρ = −0.1, implies substitution
effects between the rebel organizations, while the complemetarity scenario, ρ = 0.1, pertains
to the largest coefficient that we have estimated in the presented models. The results are
displayed in Figure 5 clearly showing that an increase in ρ increases the median fighting time
of individual rebel organizations. In this simulation the median duration increases by about
1 year when comparing ρ = 0 to the empirically estimated ρ = 0.1. This highlights that
the magnitude of the effect of strategic interdependence is fairly substantial and provides
further evidence that studies interested in the behavior of rebel organizations need to take

Robustness. We employ two alternative parameterizations using the lognormal and loglogistic distribution to minimize the risk of any artifacts due to our parametric assumptions
(see Table B4). Since both distributions are two parameter distributions, we can compare
model fit directly by comparing log-likelihood values. In this comparison, the spatial Weibull
(Model 3 in Table 2) demonstrates the best fit to our data. Generally, we find that the
Weibull parameterization provides a much better goodness of fit to the data than the loglogistic and log-normal, which is suggested by the consistently lower log-likelihood values.
Thus, we tend to place higher confidence in the Weibull results. However, it can be noted
that our main result of a positive and precise ρ estimate applies across all models. The
independence effect seems to be slightly stronger in the lognormal model than in the loglogistic model.
Another concern might be that conflict outcomes might influence the fighting dynamics.
Since dyads within one conflict can have different outcomes, we are not able to analyze separate samples because we would lose the interdependency structure. However, we can include
outcomes as a control variable. While this is not ideal, we demonstrate that the complementarity dynamics are not affected by controlling for outcomes on the rebel organization level
(see Appendix Table B5).
We also provide initial insights into whether stronger or weaker rebels react more to the
spatial effects. In doing this we estimate two separate models (see Appendix Table B6). The
first model manipulates the W matrix such that only strong rebel organizations (coded as
similarly strong or stronger than the government by the NSA data) receive the externalities
from other rebels’ fighting durations. In the second model, we do the opposite, by only
allowing weaker rebel organizations (coded as weaker than the government by NSA) to
be affected by other rebel organizations’ fighting durations. We find that weaker rebel
organizations (328 out of 379) react more strongly to the fighting durations of other rebels
than stronger organizations (51 out of 379).
Finally, we also ensure that the endogenous spatial effect is not simply picking up on the
fact that some rebel organizations are within multi-party conflicts while others are not. We
28

therefore re-estimate Models 1-3 with a sample that only contains rebel organizations nested
in multi-party conflicts. The estimated ρ coefficients are almost identical and robust to the
exclusion of single rebel organizations fighting the government (see Appendix Table B7).11
Discussion and Conclusion
When should a rebel organizations lay down their weapons? We argue that rebel organizations have incentives to remain mobilized until the end of a conflict because it allows them
to shape the post-conflict aftermath by maintaining their (i) power to negotiate, (ii) power
to spoil, (iii) power to enforce, and (iv) power to protect. We argue that these incentives
lead to strategic complementarities that outweigh potential substitution effects.
Strategic interdependence between rebel organization is widely acknowledged in the theoretical literature (Cunningham, 2006; Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009; Fearon,
2004; Akcinaroglu, 2012; Fjelde and Nilsson, 2012; Cunningham, Bakke and Seymour, 2012;
Cunningham, 2013; Nygård and Weintraub, 2015; Wood and Kathman, 2015). We here
provide an empirical framework to test the implications of strategic theories in context of
fighting durations in multi-actor civil wars. Broadly speaking, we articulated a need to narrow the gap between theoretical accounts of rebel organizations’ behavior and its empirical
testing. The literature on civil war duration has made enormous progress in the past twenty
years. From country and conflict based studies, we gained insights on the role of government strength (Mason and Fett, 1996; Balch-Lindsay and Enterline, 2000; DeRouen Jr. and
Sobek, 2004), geographic factors (Buhaug, Gates and Lujala, 2009), and economic development (Collier, Hoeffler and Soderbom, 2004). Attempting to account for 2-actor theories
(e.g., Fearon, 2004) new data projects have collected dyadic data (Harbom, Melander and
Wallensteen, 2008; Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan, 2009) that provide the foundation
for novel insights into how rebel characteristics and their relationship to the government
impact on conflict duration. However, without accounting for the strategic interdependence

between rebel organizations and dyads in empirical applications, important dynamics that
are implied by multi-actor theories (Bakke, Cunningham and Seymour, 2012; Cunningham,
2011; Akcinaroglu, 2012; Christia, 2012; Findley and Rudloff, 2012; Fjelde and Nilsson, 2012;
Nygård and Weintraub, 2015; Wood and Kathman, 2015) cannot be adequately modeled
and tested. We especially highlighted that merely measuring conflict constellations (e.g. the
number of rebel organizations) does not capture the underlying data-generating mechanisms
that are assumed by strategic theories.
Our theoretical argument that strategic complementarities among rebel organizations impact on fighting duration finds strong support in our empirical study. Accounting for interdependencies by implementing a spatial-duration estimation approach allows us to uncover
these complementarities in fighting durations. From a theoretical perspective these findings
can be interpreted as support for the argument that in multi-party conflicts, rebel organizations not only compete with the government, but also with all other rebel organizations that
challenge the state to maintain their (i) power to negotiate, (ii) power to spoil, (iii) power
to enforce, and (iv) power to protect. Clearly, there are limitations in the extent to which
we can make claims of whether the proposed dynamics are the only logic driving fighting
duration. As Cunningham, Bakke and Seymour (2012) highlight, it is very likely that “dual
contests” are taking place simultaneously, which provide incentives for both cooperation and
competition among rebel organizations. However, in aggregate our empirical findings suggest that complementarities behavior outweighs substitution dynamics in the context of civil
conflicts.
We emphasize that our study is not able to uncover the full heterogeneity of complementarity and substitution effects within conflicts. Indeed, we have merely estimated average
effects across all dyads in our sample through the global parameter ρ (although we distinguish by conflict type). We recommend that future work addresses–theoretically and
empirically–variation that might exist between dyads. The trade-off between substitution
and complementary might differ systematically depending on specific rebel characteristics.
For example, we would expect that relatively weaker rebel organizations are generally more
30

affected by spatial stimuli. In addition, further differences may also exist between conflicts,
as our preliminary analysis of secessionist vs. non-secessionist conflicts demonstrates. Indeed, we would expect that more specific theory (under specific circumstances) would lead
to stronger estimates of interdependence, as compared to the ‘crude’ estimates presented in
this study.
Finally, our study demonstrates that rebel organization interdependence is not merely
nuisance, but plays an important role in explaining rebel organizations’ fighting durations.
We contribute to the literature by theoretically stressing the strategic interactions between
rebel organizations and proposing an empirical approach, which explicitly models the interdependence of fighting durations. More generally, this paper not only pertains to the study
of civil war, but can be applied in other political science contexts that entail interdependencies of non-aligned durations. These might include US primaries (Abramson et al., 1992)
where several candidates try to outlast each other, regional democratization (Svolik, 2008)
where democratic consolidation is dependent on regional consolidation, and of course behavior between alliance members (Morrow, 1991) in the context of international relations. Our
study enables future research that explores duration dependence in these common strategic
settings.

Appendix: Maximum Likelihood Estimation
We require to estimate the following model:
1
y = ρWy + Xβ + u
λ

(1)

where y is the log of duration y ∗ , i.e. y = ln y ∗ . As shown by Hays and Kachi (2015), in
order to derive the likelihood via change of variables, we solve for u:
(2)

g −1 (y) = u = λ(y − ρWy − Xβ)

(3)

u = yλ(I − ρW) − λXβ.

The likelihood is thus given by
L = |det(J)| ×

(4)

n
Y

f (ui )

i=1

where J is the Jacobian matrix of g −1 (y).
Different parameterizations are now possible, depending on the analyst’s choice for the
distribution for u. Because the log-normal is similar to the widely known SAR for normally
distributed errors for a logged dependent variable, we here focus on the Weibull parameterization. For a Weibull model, u is distributed type-I-extreme-value:
u

f (u) = eu e−e .

(5)
The likelihood function is then
(6)

u

L = | det(J)|eu e−e ,

i.e.,
(7)

L = |det(J)| × exp[λ(y − ρWy − Xβ)] × exp[− exp(λ(y − ρWy − Xβ)]

1

with the corresponding log-likelihood function
(8)

LL = ln |det(J)| + λ(y − ρWy − Xβ) − exp[λ(y − ρWy − Xβ)].

Using eq. 3 and insights from Ord (1975), the log-Jacobian term can calculated at the outset:

(9)

ln |det(J)| =

n
X

ln(1 − ρωj ) + ln λ,

i=1

where ωj , j = 1, ..., n are eigenvalues of W.

Appendix: Construction of W connectivity matrix
We begin by stacking the vector of rank-ordered entering durations W on top of the vector
of fighting durations y:

The upper left and upper right quadrant of the W matrix are filled with zeros. By matrix
algebra, the waiting durations therefore merely make their way into the model through
the endogenous spatial lag, such that the dependent variable on the left-hand side are solely
logged fighting durations. In W, the lower left and lower right quadrant are defined according
to our theoretical approach. Indeed, they transform Equation 12 into matrix form. In detail,
the lower left quadrant L captures the relationship between the fighting times and conflict
entry times of rebel organizations, while the lower right quadrant reflects the interdependence
between fighting times. Both L and R are block-diagonal by conflicts ψ ∈ {1, . . . , Ψ},
3

meaning that we have Lψ ∈ {1, . . . , Ψ} blocks within L that correspond to each individual
conflict in the data set.

Finally, the simultaneous equations setup to accommodate different entry timings requires
us to perform transformations (via the connectivity matrix), on the raw durations, but the
accelerated failure time form of the event history model is written in log time. Thus, we
create the final connectivity matrix W = MW∗ , where y ∗ are the raw (unlogged) durations
and W∗ denotes the “raw” connectivities based on the setup given above, such that
ln(W∗ y) = MW∗ ln(y ∗ ) = Wy

(8)

Thus, we solve for M, which is a diagonal matrix for which the elements on the diagonal
are given by
than

W∗ ln(y ∗ )

(element-wise division). Note that largest eigenvalue needs to be less

to be well defined, which is the case in our empirical applications. See page 920 and

especially footnote 40 in Bramoullé, Kranton and D’Amours (2014) that outlines conditions
for unique interior equilibria.
