Internet, Social Media and Conflict Studies
Can Greater Interdisciplinarity Solve the
Analytical Deadlocks in Cybersecurity Research?
H. Akın Ünver
Abstract: In recent years, computational research methods, digital trace data and online human
interactions have contributed to the emergence of new technology-oriented sub-fields within
International Relations (IR). Although the cybersecurity scholarship had an initial promise to be the
primus inter pares among these emerging fields, the main thrust of this new methodological
innovation came through the ‘digital conflict studies’ sub-field. By integrating Internet and social
media research tools and questions into its core topics of sub-national violence, terrorism and radical
mobilization, digital conflict studies has recently succeeded in addressing some of the data validity
and methodology problems faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. This article begins by briefly
reviewing some of the persistent data and method-oriented hurdles faced by the cybersecurity
scholarship. Then, it moves onto a more detailed account of how digital conflict studies have been
addressing some of these deadlocks by focusing individually on the literature on onset, mobilization,
targeting, intensity/duration and termination phases of conflicts. Ultimately, the article concludes
with the suggestion that the cybersecurity scholarship could move past its own deadlocks by building
more granular and dedicated research datasets and establishing mechanisms to share event data with
the scientific community.

INTRODUCTION
The long-touted theoretical slumber of International Relations (IR) as a discipline1 was
markedly disturbed by the advent of the cybersecurity scholarship. Described by many
scholars as the ‘real fourth domain’, even surpassing the importance of space,
digitization of human power relations and their competition across an entirely new
ground - cyber - opened up the way for the ‘revival’ of IR.2 The pre-cyber IR was

deadlocked for two main reasons: first, in the aftermath of the Cold War the field had
lost its connection to the very origins of its existence - likelihood of large-scale globalized
war. With no pressing global threat to study and theorize, the field was split across
deconstructivist and post-positivist sub-strands that ran into their own set of
limitations3. Second, the post-9/11 turn in IR had lowered the analytical lens of the
bulk of the discipline into terrorism and sub-national violence, making IR more of a
surrogate mother of a comparative civil war or rebel dynamics offspring. The conflict
studies field has exploded so much in the last decade that it has ended up almost
swallowing IR. Yet, it focused more on insurgency, micro-dynamics of violence with a
heavy focus on dyadic socio-political interactions between state and non-state actors,
none of which being the central thrust of the IR as a discipline.
Cybersecurity promised salvation to IR from being sucked up into the vortex of conflict
and terrorism research. It offered scholars a truly global network of state and non-state
(benign and malicious) interactions pool, made some of the more classical concepts of
the field (such as bandwagoning, hedging, deterrence, retaliation) relevant again and
offered a new research agenda that went beyond conflict and violence. Attribution
problems brought a new cyber-institutionalist tradition4. Attacker’s advantage in
cybersecurity re-introduced the question of alliances, balancing and confidence-building
measures5. The fluid and largely uncharted nature of cyberspace reminded scholars of
the importance of the anarchy and hegemony debate, as well as the centrality of the
rules and norms literature in IR. While cyber hasn’t yet influenced the field as much as
either conventional or nuclear weapons did back in the Cold War, it has undoubtedly
introduced a new wave of issue-broadening nudges, briefly widening the discipline’s
obsession with sub-national violence.

However, cyber-research also ended up in a cul-de-sac of sorts. Due to the sheer
magnitude of ‘events’ in cyber research, it brought a range of conceptual and
measurement problems. These problems have led to some unforthcoming answers to
essential questions about how to study the field: What constitutes a cyber ‘attack’6?
How do we disentangle offensive and defensive capabilities in cyber7? How do we acquire
and catalogue event data, given the sheer magnitude and near-impossibility of reliably
measuring cyber competition? How do we verify the accuracy of attribution? Given
attribution problems, how do we reliably establish norms and minimize commitment
problems in compliance? Who are we establishing norms for, or against? On the other
end of the debate is the ‘megafauna’ argument that criticized the field’s over-emphasis
on a small number on politically critical cyber events (usually with physical
implications), overlooking the importance of the large volume of ‘smaller events’ that
don’t have a measurable or visible impact on infrastructure or systems8. Both ends of
the debate give us a different hurdle facing cyber-research: do we have too much, or too
little measurable data to work with? All of these data availability and quality issues of
cyber haven’t prevented theorizing about it in IR but made empirical tests of those
claims highly difficult.
Ultimately, it ran into two difficulties: first, an inability to grow beyond the confines of
traditional IR and second, dangerously treading on the ‘purely theoretical’ territory.
Even when thinking solely in terms of the disruptive effects of cyber, the nuclear
analogy ran into a number of problems. After all, nuclear weapons had a binary nature
– they are either detonated or not detonated. Their deterrent nature came from the
possibility of detonation. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is anything but binary.
DDoS, MitM, spear phishing, SQL injection and XXS are different attack types that
serve a different purpose. Often, the target learns about the fact that it was attacked
weeks after the actual incident. More sophisticated forms of cyberattacks are also hard
to notice, measure, turn into event data and are even harder to attribute to an actor. Its
twists and turns, intensity and type all require a much more nuanced understanding of
the engineering aspects of the field compared to nuclear weapons. It also rendered a
truly multi-method approach, through combined forces of computer engineers, data
scientists and IR specialists necessary, but this kind of sustained interdisciplinarity is

still rare in the scholarship. Furthermore, persistent problems in generating a
statistically meaningful (let alone representative) dataset make cybersecurity theories
difficulty to test empirically.
As cybersecurity scholarship dealt with these structural problems, Internet and social
media studies began solving some of those persistent problems in harvesting trace data
to help build new theories on technology and IR. The power of social media, both as a
form of real-time communication and also a networking hub, has been demonstrated
most visibly, first during the Arab Spring demonstrations in the MENA region and then
in Occupy movements across Europe and North America9. Then with the onset and
intensification of the Syrian, Iraqi and Ukrainian civil wars, the power of digital
interconnectedness as an enabler of mobilization, resource generation, propaganda, and
issue framing has been further bolstered10. The highly interactive and public nature of
social media platforms not only increased the speed of communication between actors
but also rendered this communication visible to the broader social media community, all
around the world. Social media has become a new marketplace of ideas, equally disliked
and needed, by politicians, diplomats, international institutions, civil society groups,
and violent groups alike.
Compared to cybersecurity, where data is both uncontrollably large, elusive and fast,
Internet research has rendered the study of human interactions in digital space more
manageable. Although data size and speed can still be an issue, social media data is less
elusive compared to cybersecurity data and depending on the platform and topic,
scraping entire sets of public data can be far easier compared to cataloguing cyber event
data. Also, the secrecy and covertness of cybersecurity research can be a deterrent
factor for social scientists, which might explain why more of them are switching to the
open source nature of social media research. Furthermore, although cyber research is
significantly important for IR theory, it lies distant to the wider empirical debates on
sample size, representativeness, measurement, causal effects, and behavioural

variances11. Ultimately, cybersecurity research risks the danger of remaining an elitefocused, small-N field compared to the large-scale ‘social’ scope of social media research,
until cybersecurity researchers solve the riddle of data extraction, dataset sharing and
measurement. This has led to a rapidly developing field of computational social science:
the use of coding and programming tools to study social dynamics, behaviour, and
choice12. Despite enriching other sub-fields in IR, however, Internet and social media
studies have primarily benefited the conflict and political violence discipline. To that
end, when exploring how Internet Communication Tools (ICTs) affect IR, the bulk of
the scholarship again comes from the conflict studies camp.
The remainder of the paper will discuss how ‘digital conflict studies’ field has
incorporated the ‘technological turn’ in IR into its main theoretical thrust, by building
upon and expanding the framework used by Lars-Erik Cederman and Manuel Vogt13 on
the main phases of conflicts: onset/initiation, resource mobilization, target prioritization,
duration/intensity and conflict termination, peacebuilding, re-integration. Although a
similar phasing or periodization is hard to model exactly on the cybersecurity
scholarship, this review aims to provide a more structured framework for the empirical
study of cybersecurity. Furthermore, this periodization may help future cybersecurity
scholars to structure their data observation, extraction, and sharing mechanisms to test
existing IR-related cybersecurity theories and build new ones.

studies inspired by the Arab Spring and Occupy movements focused on the effect of
digital media on protests, focusing mainly on onset and state responses against digital
mobilization16. As protests evolved into deadlier conflicts, the field has also evolved into
explaining how ICTs affected violence in civil wars like in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine17.
Important studies, some of which will be explored in this paper, have primarily focused
on conflict initiation, recruitment, propaganda, terrorist attacks, narrative-building,
branding/marketing of armed groups and state responses.
However, there are several fundamental conflict dynamics that are still understudied,
such as conflict duration, bargaining/negotiation and conflict termination, group
disbanding and political transition of violent conflicts. Furthermore, although there are
ample studies on how social media radicalizes individuals18, there is an insufficient body
of empirical investigation on how digital interconnectedness de-radicalizes or moderates
users. This section is divided into five sub-sections that deal with some of the main
works in their respective sub-fields and the current analytical limitations of that subfield. These are namely: conflict onset, resource mobilization, target selection,
intensity/duration, and conflict termination, peacebuilding, reintegration.

Social media has expedited the dissemination of frames related to sustained political
grievances and opportunities19. Its scope and speed led to the emergence of nongeographical communities of grievance, all receiving information about repression,
disenfranchisement, and oppression from their areas of concern20. Similarly, and a
strategy best employed by ISIS, opportunity structures in conflict, such as wealth,
prestige and social acceptance are now transmitted across the world, leading to the
mobilization of an unprecedented level of diversity in its recruits21. Of course, social
media is not the only medium through which such frames have been disseminated in the
past. Newspapers, novels and motion picture have all helped communicate grievance
and greed narratives in the past. What makes social media novel, however, is its speed
and size. Compared to older forms of media (perhaps, with the slight exception of the
live broadcasting technologies), social media and the Internet offer real-time
dissemination of narratives to a far larger audience. Some of the time-lag and media
access (urban/rural, rich/poor) constraints that were the hallmarks of older examples of
grievance/greed narrative diffusion are less relevant in the case of social media. Owing
to the lowered barriers of entry, digital communication thus increases the speed and size
of both the responses to framing stimuli and also the materialization of counternarratives.
In addition to speed and scale, ICTs also offer a permanent, non-physical and
omniaccessible archival function for its users22. This is especially valid for grievance

diffusion23, which is a crucial driver of early mobilization. By both spreading and
permanently recording events and narratives in digital space, users bestow an archival
power to digital media. This, in turn, allows grievances to be communicated not just
quicker, but also consumed in a sustained and at-will manner. In addition to enabling
masses to mobilize quickly, this sustained grievance effect of ICTs also intensifies
existing social, ethnic and religious tensions, through daily access and consumption of
grievance-related content24. This does not only impact the likelihood and frequency of
conflicts but also determines the size and social support for these conflicts. In a way, the
real-time archival utility of social media both drives violence onset likelihood, as well as
how intense these acts of violence become. This is true both for the digital content
disseminated by a single source to multiple individual users (propaganda and
information cascades) and also content sought and acquired by the users themselves
(information-seeking).
ICTs and conflict onset are a relatively well-studied dyad. Currently, some of the
frontiers in this sub-field remain the use of fake news, trolls and bots - deliberate
information manipulators - and identify how they impact greed/grievance dynamic
differently than the flow of accurate information25. Does disinformation, for example,
enable the spread of emotional and mobilizing content better than deliberate and
accurate information?26 Do non-state actors use disinformation as part of their more
extensive strategic logic, or do they find disinformation as a potentially trust-mitigating
factor?
Much of these research questions were tested overwhelmingly on ISIS, rendering the
group as a litmus test of some of the most prominent political communication theories

in digital space27. Yet, the scholarship that lies at the intersection of political
communication and computer science fields do try to address a broader range of cases
beyond ISIS. Purohit (et al.)28 and Karuna (et al.)29 use text-mining tools to look at
how digital frames on gender-based violence are disseminated online, using a corpusbased latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA). Both studies find a greater collaboration between
grievance campaigns in geographically distant communities and discover a significant
degree of ‘digital cross-pollination’ between physically disconnected online campaigns.
De De Choudhury (et al.)30 on the other hand explore how images and videos on social
media contribute to the intensification or de-sensitization of emotions in Mexico, related
to cartel-based violence. They focus on sub-district level digital content across two years
and find that both the state and cartels strategically deploy images to deter, and assert
psychological dominance against each other as well as the local populace in a methodical
way. Similarly, Monroy-Hernandez (et al.)31 dissect to what extent ‘civic bloggers’
(locals who document cartel violence on weblogs and social media) have any effect on
conflict awareness and mobilization. They discover that districts that contain more
public media bloggers and thus, are exposed to greater volume and frequency of conflict
reporting have a greater tendency to be desensitized and less likely to participate in
violence.
Wang (et al.)32 on the other hand explore the digital impact of the Sandy Hook
shootings on users’ sentiments on gun control, discovering that anti-violence (pro-guncontrol) sentiments linger on much longer compared to anti-gun control content in the
aftermath of the shooting. They also demonstrate that these pro-gun-control sentiments
linger on longer in Connecticut (the incident state), compared to other states in the
United States, invalidating the main premise of the ‘terror management theory’. In the

same vein, Ayers (et al.)33 conduct large-scale scraping of websites, forums, social media
sites and online advertisements in the US, revealing that online awareness-building
campaigns and tailored ads on digital platforms could measurably mitigate gun-related
deaths. While most of the ‘images and frames’ literature rely on text-based methods,
Won (et al.)34 focused on images shared on social media websites to draw a causal link
between emotions that those images trigger and the actual intensity of the relevant
protest event. Drawing on more than 40,000 geotagged protest images, the researchers
find that greater protest duration and intensity are correlated with the emotional
triggering capacity of the images shared from the protest area. Finally, Muller and
Schwartz demonstrate a causal relationship between anti-refugee sentiment in Germanspeaking Facebook and physical anti-refugee violence in Germany at the municipality
level35, while Patton (et al.)36 draw direct links ‘Internet bragging’ and tendency to
exhibit gang violence-related behaviour. Building a predictive model, the authors
demonstrate a high level of reliability in enabling social workers recognize gang violencerelated themes and engage in better targeted preventive action.
These studies push the field strongly into the domain of automated-recognition and
prediction foci. Most of these studies are also heavily concentrated on the US or the UK,
requiring a significant broadening of the cases beyond the global north. Some of the
untapped research questions include how regional inequality, linguistic or ethnic
fractionalization, and regime type influence the ICT-onset literature.

b. Resource Mobilization
Not all successful cases of greed/grievance communication lead to violence. Without preexisting social forces and trust relations, purely digital networks have a low level of
success of mobilizing or remaining mobilized for an extended period37. One of the main

drivers of the staying power of movements is how well they mobilize resources38. This
mobilization is not just limited to manpower or financial resources but also includes
sustenance of frames, attention, alliances, commitment and organizational cohesion. To
that end, the advent of social media and the Internet are primarily thought as positive
drivers of resource mobilization. After all, this was one of the main reasons why the
early works on the Arab Spring and Occupy movements were quick to call them ‘social
media revolutions’39. When dissidents discovered their latent power through digital
interconnectivity, they were able to come together and challenge hegemony, or so the
logic went. However, later studies have proved that this was not always the case40.
Social media was a significant development but was also exaggerated in its effect on
social movements. ICTs did drive attention and awareness, but these two variables had
a mixed effect on actual mobilization, commitment or staying power. Rather, ICTs
effects relied on pre-existing traditional networks and trust relations; it is only when
these existing networks are in place that ICTs could play a major role.
This necessitates a greater empirical focus on the analytical sweet spot that delves into
how traditional social networks use and deploy ICTs to generate sustained resource.
Mostly, studies omit this context and try to draw a straightforward causal link between
how much movements use social media and how well they mobilize. Furthermore, past
the onset and mobilization mark, few studies explore how movements sustain both
ideological and material resources, especially when the rival actor is also a non-state
actor41. To that end, most scholarship focuses on how protestors, rioters, militias and
terrorist groups utilize ICTs against state actors, but not much on how this interaction
materializes between and within non-state actors themselves. Some of the most novel
ways of studying mobilization dynamics can be seen in Gahot (et al.)42 where the
authors use epidemiological modelling to see the diffusion and sustenance of the 2005

French riots. This is one of the better experiments in bringing greater interdisciplinarity
into social research, as the authors pay specific attention to social dynamics
(neighbourhood relations, district social networks, and protestor community proximity)
in their contagion model. In a similar vein, Davies (et al.)43 explore how 2011 London
riots have been mobilized against police crackdown, using digital communication tools
to build a contagion dataset of both onset and sustained resource-generation dynamics.
Ultimately, the authors discover that there is a Pareto-optimal level of police presence
per each riot district that deters rioter resource mobilization; any less or more police
deployment causes greater protest mobilization and resources deployed in the riot.
ICT-religion nexus is a potentially helpful disciplinary link to conflict studies, especially
in terms of exploring how loose belief networks retain membership, income and resourcegeneration practices in digital space. Heidi Campbell demonstrates how Christian
congregations that are geographically distant can retain ‘online congregations’ through
live-feed sermons and chat groups44. These online congregations not only build
awareness and disseminate frames, but also play a significant role in the material
domain, in terms of fundraising and mustering numbers for protests and social
responsibility projects45. In the same vein, Ellison and Boyd illustrate how this ‘online
congregation’ dynamic can be observed in Islam and Judaism as well, as individuals
discover and often times identify with their digital congregations more than their
physical ones46. Mellor and Rinnawi focus specifically on the Islamic use of ICTs and
exemplify how digital congregations are more important drivers of resource mobilization
in diaspora Islamic communities in Europe and the United States, whereas in
predominantly Muslim countries too, the effect of social media leads to the emergence of
diverging loyalties47. Such diverging loyalties create an ‘à la carte Islam’ where the pious
can choose from different sermons and fatwas issued by the online or offline imams,
demonstrating hybrid loyalties based on which congregation or imam supply the version
of theological interpretation they require. On Judaism, Nathan Abrams demonstrates

and mobilization dynamics display similar congregational hybridity that we see in
Islam48.

c. Target Prioritization
Once movements attain critical mass and are directed in unison towards a common goal,
the next step becomes target selection. In the case of non-violent movements, this target
becomes a key building, central square, or a historic site to occupy or do a sit-in,
whereas in violent movements these range from military installations/checkpoints,
critical infrastructure or (with terrorist groups) civilian areas. What is the role of social
media on how groups pick their targets and guide their followers to that target? Some of
the earlier works on this question had a slight reporting bias around areas of high
Internet connectivity49, although newer forms of scholarship have begun developing
unique ways to disentangle violence occurrence from violence reporting50. Some of the
most prominent studies on violence targeting emphasize four trends: strategic area/zone
focus, critical infrastructure focus, political focus and intimidation focus. There is
currently no major work on how ICTs affect any particular focus. Rather, most targetrelated studies explore how social media sustains and intensifies ongoing conflict
dynamics, evidenced best in Thomas Zeitzoff’s work on the 2012 Gaza Conflict51. Also,
Jibon Naher and Matiur Rahman Minar look at how social media posts drive chat
groups or page followers to particular types of violence, including the target(s) of such
acts in Bangladesh52. They demonstrate how ICTs not only impact the speed and size of
violent mobilization, but also drive users towards definitive ethnic or religious groups
and sites that are important for their adversaries.

Targeting presents a very specific causal problem in ICT-conflict nexus. The majority of
existing studies can explain how ICT use can guide mobilization, intensity, polarization
and radicalization, but there is not much on whether the popularity of particular target
types on ICTs really affect physical targeting behaviour on the ground. This is a
challenging puzzle to solve, because it is hard to disaggregate targeting choice as a result
of its social media popularity, or the order of a commanding superior53. Further
problems arise in determining whether ICTs influence commanders, or troops on the
ground in hand picking a particular set of targets. Especially with regard to communal
violence, the role of ICTs in instigating certain ethnic or religious groups using targeted
messaging and imagery is under-explored. Similar to military targeting, there is much to
be done on exploring whether the decision to attack a particular target or community
follows a strict hierarchy (i.e. communal elders or propagandists) or generate a mob
mentality (autonomous crowd behaviour). Some tangential journalism work on this is
done through WhatsApp-related gang violence; specifically, in India54. Some of the most
relevant findings on this line of inquiry are that digital targeting practices through text
or images contribute substantially to the unearthing of dormant social tensions, leading
to attacks on women specifically. This gender dimension in violent group targeting
prioritization is an important avenue for further research and connects somewhat to
another strand of literature on digital shaming and harassment55. Furthermore, due to
the real-time effects of ICTs, there is far less time gap between designating a target in
digital space and the actual mobilization of the masses around the designated target.
I have discovered this targeting effect of ICTs when exploring the mobilization dynamics
during the failed coup in Turkey in July 201656. Sharing videos, images, and text in

large numbers, anti-coup protestors were extremely quick in mobilizing and
overwhelming checkpoints, military installations and other hotspots of conflict. In most
cases, it is possible to draw direct linkages between the emergence of a particular
hotspot or target on social media and the massing of crowds around it within an hour or
less. We also, however, warn against the existing social network dimension of these
targeting preferences. It is not only ICTs that guided people to specific locations; it is
rather the dissemination of these targets through family, friend or religious congregation
channels (all trusted pre-existing networks) through ICTs that created the trust
network required to march towards designated spots. Future ICT-targeting studies have
to take this digital-physical interaction into account.

d. Intensity and Duration
Conflict intensity and duration have grown increasingly popular in the last decade,
owing to new datasets and measurement types allowing greater analytical focus. The
primary thrust of the conflict intensity/duration literature has been to inform policy on
the ways of shortening conflicts.57 By reducing conflict duration, the conflict literature
asserted, conflict intensity would also be reduced58. However, premature freezing of
conflicts due to external pressure also frequently lead to a re-escalation of those conflicts
once international attention wanes59. Therefore, the causal relationship between
duration and intensity is still being negotiated in the literature as this link works
differently in various political contexts. Although conflict intensity (measured as
casualties) and duration (measured as months) have been explained most popularly
through combatant motivation, financing, public commitment, capacity and external
support60, the role of ICTs has been a relatively nascent inquiry. The common consensus

in the conflict literature is that ICTs make conflicts more intense61. This finding is being
increasingly challenged by a new scholarship that focuses on the availability bias and
measurement level problems of these findings. Nils Weidmann, for example, asserts
convincingly that access to ICTs creates a reporting bias62. This reporting bias is both
related to the communication of violent cases that would remain uncommunicated
without ICTs and also that those with access to ICTs tend to over-share violent events
compared to non-violent events in a conflict zone. This brings the need for
interdisciplinarity to solve some of the availability bias and data-gathering problems
related to proximity to ICT infrastructure.
Guo (et al.)63 for example, demonstrate how betweenness centrality can offer a higher
explanatory power on why certain geographies become more conflict-prone than others.
They emphasize cities as hubs of communication and thus, bestow greater importance to
the cities for their narrative and frame-dissemination capacity that in turn influence
conflict intensity and duration patterns. In their view, conflict intensity and duration
are both proportional to their distance to major cities, and also the betweenness
centrality measures of major cities themselves. Walther (et al.)64 on the other hand
focus on the Sahel-Sahara to aggregate digital and pre-digital communication and
archival data to generate a militant attack database. Using this database, they are able
to infer which national communication and counter-insurgency policies worked better in
terms of mitigating the intensity and duration of the Al Qaeda in Mali (AQIM) violence
in the Sahel region. However, with the exception of these few examples, the ICTduration or intensity literature is still very young. A potential analytical field to
approach the intensity/duration problem would be to engage more with the digital
political communication literature.
Echo chambers and polarization are proper proxy measures to solve this deadlock.

accounts that are similar in political ideology, but that such similarity disappears in
non-political issues. This could be an inspirational point of departure for conflict studies
as the dissemination of conflict-related information along ideological or identity lines
would potentially have a significant influence on conflict intensity. Del Vicaro (et al.)66
on the other hand, demonstrate how disinformation is especially contingent upon
network ideology. Focusing on how conspiracy theories flow on Facebook, authors
demonstrate that polarization becomes more observable in the dissemination of false
narratives rather than accurate information. This is especially relevant for conflict
research, as emotion-eliciting information tends to be fake and it is mostly fake news
that provokes violent action among groups. Bastos (et al.)67 test the same hypothesis in
the Brexit campaign and discover that both accurate and inaccurate types of content
are shared across a more dense and central network in the Leave camp and follows a
looser and less dense network in the Stay camp. This finding is important as it hints at
the role of political ideology in the dissemination of accurate and false-type conflictrelated content. In a more recent study, Cota (et al.)68 look at a large dataset of Twitter
messages from Brazil, related to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and
discover that more extreme content got disseminated across a broader audience,
compared to less extreme and more moderate content that had a low level of spread.
This study sheds some light on potential conflict communications literature on the
degree to which extreme versus moderate content becomes popular during emergencies,
escalations and critical political moments.
e. Termination, Peacebuilding, Re-integration
How do ICTs impact the decision to end a conflict? The literature is skewed so much on
the initiative and sustaining dynamics of ICTs on conflict, that the analytical ‘wave’
hasn’t yet reached the final stages of the violence cycle. This owes partly to the fact
that recent years have witnessed much more conflict initiation and escalation compared
to conflict termination69. Most conflict termination scholarship focuses on tangible
factors, such as the decline of manpower, funds or other resources to explain de66

escalation and termination dynamics70. Other studies explain how external
interventions, infighting, leadership change and social shifts might lead to similar
outcomes71. However, there have been no empirical studies yet on how ICTs impact the
de-escalation and termination aspects of conflicts.
Earlier hypotheses on how ICTs might influence conflict offered promising notes. Most
of them thought of greater interconnectedness and at-will information availability to
have a normalizing effect on violent interactions. Importing from more traditional
theories on media and conflict, the early ICT literature suggested that warring factions
or mobilized masses could be ‘convinced’ to stand down, and attain greater mutual
understanding with the rival groups (or governments), resulting in conflict
termination72. Most of the 1990s’ peacebuilding initiatives thus emphasized ‘greater
communication’ and frequent socialization between the sides and by 2000s, most such
initiatives welcomed the idea of digital communication as a peace enabler73. The
evidence yielded a more complex and nuanced picture, however. One main misjudgment
about ICT-peace link was the fact that ICTs grew into multi-directional media systems,
as opposed to the uni-directional nature of TV, motion picture, or radio. This meant
that ‘feeding content’ to warring factions, in the same manner propaganda worked in
the past, was impossible74. Content consumers are now also content producers and
curators, causing far too many narratives to spread online for any single actor to

dominate the mainstream agenda at-will75. The prevalence of multiple and competing
narratives, along with the ever-present shadow of disinformation also have a chance of
intensifying existing divisions, rather than healing them76. To counter these effects,
along with attempts to skew these discussions by combing out ‘unwanted content’,
governments have also begun increasingly reliant on censorship, net restrictions, as well
as the strategic deployment of bots and trolls to further contaminate the information
ecosystem77. However, these tools are still not dominantly in use in most conflict-prone
countries as instability prevents the establishment of functioning Internet infrastructure.
This severs the link between ICTs and affected communities in rural areas or poor
urban districts, and renders any uni-directional move towards mediation inefficient.
From existing empirical evidence, it is hard to hypothesize that ICTs will have any
standalone effect on conflict termination and peacebuilding, without interacting with
material factors on the ground. Some of these material factors are already well-covered
by the non-ICT conflict termination literature: external intervention, combatant resolve,
leadership change, resource depletion, social change and so on. In an interaction with
any of these factors, ICTs may bolster peacekeeping efforts, provided that the material
factors are realistically in place and in a visible, sustained manner.
The final link in the conflict chain is attaining sustained non-violence and communitybuilding in the affected territories. Currently, there are no significant works in the field
of how ICTs impact peacekeeping and community-building, leaving a sizeable analytical
gap in the literature. This originates from the overwhelming focus on the earlier
onset/mobilization aspects of violence, leaving a plethora of untapped topics on the later
phases of violence. Yet, the literature will inevitably gravitate towards the more positive
and constructive aspects of ICTs on conflict. Community-building and re-integration
phase of the conflict cycle have a higher likelihood of being impacted by purely ICT-led

efforts. When willingness to fight is diminished and the societal-political consensus is in
place, then ICT tools can work through a multitude of ways to help bolster the peace
agreement and its enforcement. Most direct and visible use of ICTs in this phase is to
monitor a ceasefire and other commitment violations, enabling all parties to keep an eye
on the other in a more direct way78. When the speed and scale advantages of ICTs are
deployed after peace is attained, then these assets can significantly bolster confidencebuilding measures and render community-building and re-integration efforts more
robust. In other words, ICTs will work, when there are ‘physical’ attempts towards
reconciliation, and will remain ineffective without any social consensus or driver towards
mediation.
CONCLUSION
This article has aimed to trace some of the current analytical fronts of digital conflict
studies to offer a framework for IR’s cybersecurity scholarship on how it could escape
some of the short-term methodological and conceptual deadlocks. Most directly, the
cybersecurity field suffers from an absence of granular and representative (or even
indicative) data generation and sharing mechanism for the purposes of the scholarly
community. This prevents an empirical testing of the majority of the claims made in
cybersecurity theory, as well as impair how much we can import from the oft-mentioned
‘nuclear analogy’ in IR for the purposes of the cybersecurity scholarship. One of the
main reasons why digital conflict studies discipline could surmount most of the hurdles
posed by the emerging technologies is that the field has been building granular and
representative event datasets since the 1960s. From the founding blocks of the
Correlates of War Project in the 1960s, UCDP/PRIO and START-UMD datasets
emerged, leading up the way for the emergence of many other dataset projects including
ICEWS, ACLED, ViEWS and GDELT projects. Multiple long-term, open source
scientific research datasets have rendered the conflict literature more advantageous in
adapting to the requirements of the technological turn in IR. Absent of a long-term,
scientific event dataset, cybersecurity researchers of IR have to work with an ambiguous
sample of cybersecurity events that will structurally remain insufficient for robust
theory-building and theory testing.

A second major difference is that the digital conflict studies has grown far more
interdisciplinary and collaborative than the cybersecurity scholarship. By focusing on
human trace data to infer human conflict dynamics, the digital conflict literature has
largely retained the social and human prerogatives of the field. In contrast,
cybersecurity scholarship is still very much distant to the core questions of political and
social fundamentals of digitalized human interactions, so far refraining from directly
dealing with the role of psychology, sociology and ethnographic aspects of cybersecurity.
One recent exception is Nadiya Kostyuk and Yuri Zhukov’s exploration of how cyberattacks influence conflict dynamics on the front lines in Ukraine.79 This article provides
one of many potential trajectories for the cybersecurity scholarship in addressing the
data availability and validity issues.
ICTs bring a set of welcome challenges and opportunities for conflict research. However,
the most immediate task for the IR discipline in general is to escape yet another conflict
studies entrapment when successfully adapting to the question of how emerging
technologies impact world events. ICTs bring a wide array of analytical opportunities to
test IR’s existing mainstream theories, as well as develop new ones as digital
communication enables the harvesting of both more abundant and more granular data
types. These data types will not only improve our understanding of how states interact
with their societies and other states in the digital domain, but will also lead the way to
the formulation of more advanced types of international institutions and cooperation
architectures. Regardless, conflict studies will likely continue to spearhead the IR’s
broader disciplinary focus on the ICTs.
While there is quite an abundance of attention on the earlier phases of social movements
and violent events, there is currently a gap in the more advanced phases of such
phenomena. The field is still very much nascent in explaining how ICT use affects target
selection, intensity/duration, and peacebuilding efforts, but have a relatively more
robust set of findings on the onset and mobilization phases. To remedy this gap, digital
political communication literature seems to be the most apparent linkage for the conflict
studies community. Some of the most prominent works in PolCom already have
theoretical answers to how violence affects attention, emotion and mediation in critical
political events and debates.
Yet, the bulk of that literature focuses on American or European contexts, where both
Internet penetration and social media use are significant enough to yield robust

results80. The challenge of the conflict studies literature is double-pronged: first, tackle
data availability and parity issues in comparative works on countries with uneven access
to ICTs, and second, disentangle conflict reporting frequency from conflict occurrence
frequency. Both problems may eventually solve themselves as global interconnectivity
widens and ICT data becomes more representative and comparable. However, studies
can still benefit significantly from exploring how yearly, generational or geographical
changes in ICT use impact all five phases of conflicts discussed above. Rather than
waiting for ICT data to become eventually representative, scholars may find a plethora
of topics to dig into across cases in areas with different levels of digital access. Greater
interdisciplinarity with the field of computer science, physics, biology and complexity
fields will enable conflict researchers to generate more sophisticated models and more
robust findings on this emerging frontier.
Another largely untapped topic is the role of technology companies in
driving/mitigating conflict. Platform architecture, as well as increased relevance of big
tech companies during crises and emergencies, render them de facto actors in all
conflicts81. Direct effects of platform influence on conflicts, such as the decision to censor
and emphasize certain types of content, or decision to partner with the governments or
certain civil society actors will have an increasing influence on all phases of conflicts.
However, indirect effects, such as algorithmic bias82, attention economy83 and rentgeneration structures of social networks84 will also impact conflicts and conflict actors
significantly. Given the fact that platforms run on advertisement revenue and those
advertisements target engagement metrics, it will be inevitable for platforms to push
80

A further line of inquiry would be whether heavy scholarly and policy attention on disinformation in Western
liberal democracies render disinformation and organized distraction easier and more likely in countries outside NATO
and/or are not liberal democracies. For a range of time-frequency analyses on countries beyond mainstream scholarly

more extreme content that elicits an emotional response and thus, generate more
revenue.
The success of the emerging ‘digital conflict studies’ can offer three main lessons for the
burgeoning cybersecurity and international relations field. First, ‘cyberIR’ has to
prioritize building event datasets that strike a balance between data size and quality.
Given the fact that conflict studies has several important datasets and data processing
projects unique to the field (UCDP/PRIO85, ICEWS86, ACLED87, UMD-START88, or
ViEWS89), the field is better-suited to incorporate digital media and communicationrelated data types. Although Center for Strategic and International Studies90 and
Council on Foreign Relations91 have their IR-specific ‘major events’ data, the cases are a
very unhelpfully small fraction of cybersecurity events that happen on a daily basis.
Furthermore, both datasets bring in the question of ‘major event according to whom?’
given the heavy bias in favour of attacks against American infrastructure. Even data
from Norse Corporation, FireEye, Kaspersky, Fortinet or similar cybersecurity
companies are by no means representative, or transparent in terms of the methodology
behind data generation. Furthermore, their full data aren’t available for public use,
which brings its own set of replication problems. Second, Cyber-IR scholarship has to
reach beyond the confines of traditional IR theories and begin engaging more with the
techno-sociology and techno-politics literature. How do states and societies perceive and
prioritize the dangers of threats originating from the cybersecurity/defense domain?
What is the impact of organizational, political and social differences between and within
countries in politicizing and securitizing cyber threats? How do we incorporate
disinformation, information overload and digital distraction into the IR’s threat
spectrum? How does the ‘modes of production’ of digital hardware, software and data
impact balance of power between countries and alter state-society relations in a global
scale? Should the field deal primarily with the threats faced by states (infrastructure
damage, national secrecy and confidential data hacking) or the society (surveillance,
data capitalism, private data protection)? Finally, the cybersecurity scholarship will
have to broaden its focus of interest beyond what the major powers are doing and study
the impact of major power rivalry on the rest of the world, with specific emphasis on

inter-state and sub-state inequalities. Given the fact that access to advanced
cybersecurity technology is a distinct privilege of only the wealthiest of nations, it is
expected to create another form of hegemonic balancing and counter-balancing
behaviour. How do we study regional and systemic inequalities in access to
cybersecurity hardware and software infrastructure and how do these inequalities shape
state behaviour and state-society relationship across different regimes and security
cultures?
Ultimately, ICTs will occupy a more important place in the media-conflict nexus
compared to the historical effects of the telegram, radio, TV or motion picture. This is
because access to ICTs is more intimate (i.e. through smartphones that are always
nearby), real-time, multi-directional and at-will compared to all previous forms of mass
communication. This will also render ICT a key analytical topic in all aspects of human
relations, including conflict. More focus on the communicative aspects of mobilization,
movements and violence will ultimately unlock new ideas and theories of human
behavior. To do this, however, this article argued in favor of the analytical value of
greater interdisciplinary and more risk-taking across fields.
