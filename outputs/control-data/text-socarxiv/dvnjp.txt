Foreword
In 2015 the New Zealand government passed the Harmful Digital Communications Act 1 to
deter, prevent and mitigate harm caused by digital communications and to provide victims of
harmful digital communications with a quick and efficient means of redress. At the heart of the
Act are ten communications principles that together describe a broad range of challenging
online communications that people can send and receive. We have drawn on principle 10 as
the focus for this study. It says that a digital communication should not:-

denigrate a person’s colour, race, ethnic or national origins, religion,
gender, sexual orientation or disability
This principle extends to a limited set of communications which could be considered hateful
in nature. We wanted to better understand the experiences of New Zealanders receiving, or
being exposed to, these kinds of communications. This is important for us - in our Approved
Agency role under the Act – so we can continue to provide the right kind of advice and
support for those that need it. We are also motivated by the idea that harmful digital
communications are a shared problem, requiring a shared solution involving government,
industry, academia, community groups, schools, families and whānau. Simply, at Netsafe we
believe that reliable evidence based on New Zealanders’ experience is vital if our individual
or collective efforts are to be effective.
Online hate speech is not a new topic. So, it was a surprise to find that, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to look at the topic of online hate speech in New Zealand. It
is also timely, as the topic of online hate seems to have emerged into in our collective
consciousness over the last couple of years, delivered by a series of international and New
Zealand media stories. This study reaches beyond the headlines to ask New Zealanders’
about their experiences of online hate speech, including why they think they received it, and
its impact on them.
What we have found raises important questions about online hate speech in New Zealand.
The findings in this report reveal how some groups of New Zealander’s are more likely to be
targeted by online hate speech than others, depending on factors such as ethnicity, religion,
disabilities, sexuality and gender. Worryingly, there are similarities with findings from other
studies we have carried out into harmful digital communications in NZ.
We also asked participants in the study to tell us in their own words about the impact that
receiving such digital communications had on them. Many people shared online experiences
they found difficult at the time and that had a lasting impact on them. Their comments provide
a brief insight into the myriad of personal stories that sit underneath the statistics. They also
highlight the many challenges that remain in tackling issues such as online hate.
We believe that the insights in this report should represent an important step forward in our
understanding of the issues surrounding this topic.

Executive Summary
The purpose of this report is to present findings from an exploratory study regarding adult
New Zealanders’ personal experiences of and exposure to online hate speech. The study,
which is part of a larger project regarding online risks and harm, is the first of its kind in the
country. Netsafe, the Approved Agency under the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015,
carried out this study to contribute research evidence and insights to the understanding of
the extent and impact of online hate speech in New Zealand.
Online hate speech2 has been a topic of public concern and research interest for some time.
Initially the focus of this centred on the proliferation of online groups and websites promoting
and distributing discriminatory content. Since the introduction of more interactive tools and
platforms in the mid-2000s that enabled new and faster ways of disseminating content in a
relatively anonymous fashion, concerns about online hate speech becoming a pervasive
behaviour have increased.
Current research and analysis acknowledge the complex nature of online hate, the mediating
role of technology and the influence of other contextual factors (e.g. social or political events).
However, despite the growing attention on the topic, New Zealand-based research looking at
personal experiences and/or exposure to online hate is surprisingly absent. This study seeks
to address this gap. It builds on existing international research on young people’s
experiences to explore those of the adult New Zealand population based on a nationally
representative sample.
The research instrument used for this study was an online survey. The survey was
administered by Colmar Brunton in June 2018. The maximum margin of error for the whole
population is ±3.1% at the 95% confidence level. The sample is representative of the wider
population on key demographics: age, gender, ethnicity, and location.
In looking at the extent and frequency of personal experiences, this study found that online
hate speech is more prevalent among minority groups. It was equally interesting to find that
male and younger adults were more commonly targeted than females and older adults. The
report also provides insights into the most common reasons participants perceived for being
targeted with hateful content online. Furthermore, it reports the negative impact that online
hate had on people who personally experienced being targeted by this content. The insights
about exposure to online hate reflect results from similar international research.
This report provides the starting point to better understand the extent and impact of online
hate speech in New Zealand. We believe this study is also a useful source that adds to the
growing international body of research on this topic. Finally, the delivery of this report reflects
Netsafe’s commitment to providing the online safety community with research-based insights
about online behaviours and the impact of digital communications in New Zealand.

Key findings
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF ONLINE HATE SPEECH
•

Overall, 11% of New Zealand adults reported to have been personally targeted with
online hate speech in the prior year.

•

Online hate3 was more prevalent among:
o Minority ethnic groups, particularly Asians, followed by those who identified
themselves within the ‘other’ ethnicity category, then Māori, and Pacific
participants.
o Males (13%) compared to females (8%).
o Younger adults, especially those between 18 and 39 years old.
o People with disabilities (15%) compared to those without impairments (10%).
o Non-heterosexual respondents (e.g. gay, lesbian).

•

Of those targeted, about 6 in 10 reported a negative impact from the experience. Most
reported being affected emotionally but also exhibiting changes in their behaviour. A
third indicated not being affected.

•

‘Religion’ was the most frequent perceived reason for being personally targeted with
online hate speech. This was followed by political views, appearance, race, and
ethnicity.

•

In relation to gender:
o Males believed they were targeted mainly because of their religion, race, political
views, and ethnicity.
o Females, meanwhile, concurred on religion but rated gender and age significantly
higher than males.

EXPOSURE TO ONLINE HATE SPEECH

3

•

In the prior year, about 3 in 10 of all participants had seen or encountered online hate
speech that targeted someone else.

•

Exposure to online hate was more common among participants within ‘other’ ethnic
groups.

•

Those who were exposed to online hate believed that people were more commonly
targeted because of their religion, race and/or ethnicity.

•

In the prior year, 1 in 20 had intentionally visited a website, online forum and/or social
media site that promotes online hate speech.

•

Intentional engagement with these online sites was more common among males,
young people under 30 years old, Asians, and those who identified themselves as
non-heterosexual.

Note we use the terms ‘online hate speech’ and ‘online hate’ interchangeably.

Introduction
Last year Netsafe conducted the first Annual Population Survey in the context of the Harmful
Digital Communications Act 2015. The purpose was to gauge adult New Zealanders’
experiences with unwanted digital communications4, and to develop a better understanding
of digital risks and their potential harm. At that time, around a third of participants reported
having experienced one or more than one type of unwanted content online in the prior year.
Interestingly, one of the most common experiences among participants (9%) was to receive a
digital communication(s) that said offensive things about their lifestyle or their religious or
political beliefs. The report for that study was published early this year (see Netsafe, 2018a).
With this valuable but limited insight, Netsafe decided to explore in more detail the extent and
impact of online hate speech. Our interest was also triggered by the lack of evidence on the
topic as agencies in New Zealand are not required to systematically collect data on hate
speech (Spoonley, 2018).
This section of the report presents a summary of relevant literature focusing on available
statistical research on personal experiences and exposure to online hate speech. The
purpose is to provide a context for the study and support interpretation and comparison of
our results whenever possible.

Background
Online hate speech is a complex phenomenon
In addition to the multiple opportunities afforded by digital technologies they also provide a
means for spreading hateful content. Accounts of online hate activities date from the mid1980s when a Commodore 64 desktop computer with a telephone modem connection was
used to allow skinheads, Klansmen, and Neo-Nazis to communicate and download electronic
bulletin boards (Duffy, 2003). Since then, initial research interest on online hate centred on
the growth of hateful websites and the characteristics and dynamics of online hate groups,
from white supremacists to terrorist groups, but also on the type and the persuasiveness of
the messages disseminated (see Burris, Smith, & Strahm, 2000; Duffy, 2003; Gerstenfeld,
Grant, & Chiang, 2003; Lee & Leets, 2002).
The inception of more innovative tools, such as social media platforms, has given rise to new
challenges and concerns in regard to online hate (Gagliardone, Gal, Alves, & Martinez, 2015;
Keipi, Näsi, Oksanen, & Räsänen, 2016; Silva, Mondal, Correa, Benevenuto, & Weber, 2016). In
this context, as commentators highlight (see Brown, 2017; Gagliardone et al., 2015), online
hate speech is low cost, can be facilitated anonymously and pseudonymously, is easy to
access, is instantaneous, can reach a larger audience, and can be spread via different formats
across multiple platforms. It also raises cross-jurisdictional issues in regard to legal
mechanisms for combatting it.
However, one of the long-term challenges has been the lack of an agreed understanding and
definition of online hate speech (Alba, 2017; Spoonley, 2018). This has methodological
implications for researchers, affecting the way data are collected, interpreted, and reported.

For a definition of unwanted digital communications see the Glossary section in this report.

Similarly, as Alba (2017) describes, it creates practical difficulties in terms of preventing or
removing hateful content online.
Equally important are the evolving perceptions of what constitutes online hate speech. For
example, legal perspectives initially focused on expressions of racism and xenophobia online
but research has also moved towards instances of online hate in relation to gender, disability,
and sexual orientation (Gagliardone et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2016). In regard to the latter point,
HateBase, a crowdsourced database that relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to track hate
speech in social media, has created a list of the most frequent types of hate speech based on
the collection of the range and number of words used in abusive content (HateBase, 2018).
According to this list, at the time of writing, online hate speech mainly targets ethnicity, then
nationality, and class. These are followed by religion, sexual orientation as well as gender and
disability. These different forms of online hate are also reflected in the policies and
community standards of major online platforms such as YouTube and Facebook (see
Facebook, n.d.; YouTube, n.d.). For this study, we provide a working definition of online hate
speech which is included in the Methodology section of the report.
Evidence shows that more instances of online hate speech occur on social media (Hawdon,
Oksanen, & Räsänen, 2014; Keipi et al., 2016; Mondal, Silva, & Benevenuto, 2017). This has
attracted attention in exploring online hate on specific social media platforms (see Miškolci,
Kováčová, & Rigová, 2018; Williams & Burnap, 2016) and/or using computational
methodologies to detect, remove, and understand the dynamics of hateful content distributed
through these tools (Mondal et al., 2017).
Major social media platforms are also using AI and computational methods to detect and
remove online hate speech from their services. However, there are concerns about the bias
of computer-based assessments of what online content is acceptable (Alba, 2017) or how the
learning of an AI system can be used in unintended and unanticipated ways (Buranyi, 2017).
Another response to mitigating online hate is the introduction of regulatory frameworks, such
as Germany’s recent law that demands social media platforms remove hateful content from
their services within 24 hours (Martin & Rolph, 2016). In addition to computational and legal
responses, online hate is argued to be effectively addressed through education that helps
people to be ethically-reflective users, develop their digital literacy skills (Gagliardone et al.,
2015) and their ability to respond through counter-speech (Martin & Rolph, 2016). However,
despite the good intentions, rigorous assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of
these different approaches to prevent and mitigate the impact of online hate is still lacking
(Blaya, 2018).

What the evidence on personal experiences and exposure tells us
Available international research on personal experiences of and exposure to online hate
speech has primarily looked at children and young people as well as the content,
dissemination and legal consequences of hateful material (Oksanen, Hawdon, Holkeri, Näsi, &
Räsänen, 2014). Additionally, in most cases, measures vary not only across countries but also
within a single country due to research design and other factors.
In the context of children’s experiences, a representative study in the United States (Ybarra,
Mitchell, & Korchmaros, 2011) among participants aged 10-15 years old found that only a small
percentage of children visited hate sites in 2006 (2.6%), 2007 (2.3%), and 2008 (3.5%). These
findings contrast with longitudinal research that suggests other forms of online risks and

9 | Online hate speech in NZ

challenges such as online harassment have steadily increased in the United States (see
Jones, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2013). In Europe, another study in 25 countries (Livingstone,
Haddon, Görzig, & Ólafsson, 2011) revealed that 12% of European children (11-16 years old)
encountered hate messages online in the prior year, adding that exposure to this sort of
material increases with the age of the child. In Australia, a recent study commissioned by the
eSafety Commissioner (2017) found that 56% of children and teens aged 12-17 years old have
seen racist comments online and that 53% have seen or heard hateful comments about
cultural or religious groups. In New Zealand evidence about the prevalence of experiences
and exposure to online hate speech among children is yet to be gathered.
Some attention has also been paid to youths and young adults’ personal experiences of and
exposure to online hate speech. Among the few available studies, Hawdon, Oksanen and
Räsänen’s (2014) online survey with young Americans aged 15 to 30 years old found that
some 53.4% of respondents had been exposed to online hate in the prior three months. In
addition, 15.8% said they had been personally targeted. The study also found that young
people reported that the hateful content they were exposed to was most commonly focused
on people’s sexual orientation and ethnicity/nationality followed by their political views,
religious convictions, gender and physical appearance. Similarly, Costello, Hawdon, Ratliff and
Grantham (2016; 2017) looked at young Americans but broadened the age group (15 to 36
year olds). In one of the studies, when asked whether they have been personally targeted
with online hate at any time of their life, 23% of respondents said “yes”. These participants
also indicated that the most common reason for receiving this sort of content was ethnicity or
race and then appearance, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, political views, nationality, and
sex/gender (Costello et al., 2017). Costello and his colleagues also asked young Americans
about online hate exposure. In this respect, a significant 65.4% indicated having come across
hateful content during the three months prior to completing the survey (Costello et al., 2016).
There have also been other attempts to measure exposure to online hate across countries. A
study on young people found that exposure was a common experience but varied between
the countries surveyed: Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States
(Hawdon, Oksanen, & Räsänen, 2017). Conducted between 2013 and 2014, the study asked
young participants whether they have seen hateful content online in the last three months.
The findings revealed that exposure was higher among American respondents (53%) followed
by Finns (48%), Britons (39%) and Germans (31%). Regarding the estimated likelihood of being
exposed, there were some differences by country with Americans and Finns having a higher
chance of being exposed to online hate. The study also found that in the United States and
the United Kingdom online hate exposure increased with young people’s age. Similarly, while
there were significant differences across countries, young male Americans were more likely
to be exposed to online hate compared to female Americans.
On the other hand, evidence also suggests that the increase in exposure to online hate
speech can be associated with the nature and impact of certain social events and conditions.
For instance, Williams and Burnap’s (2016) study explored the impact that a 2013 terrorist
attack perpetrated by Islamist extremists in London had among social media users in the
United Kingdom. The authors collected data from Twitter for a two-week period after the
attack. They found that the attack triggered the production and propagation of online hate on
Twitter targeting religion and race. Recently, Kaakinen, Oksanen and Räsänen (2018) looked
at the impact of terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015. For this study they compared two
datasets from Finnish young people aged 15 to 30: one collected in 2013 and the other in
2015, one month after the attacks. The findings supported their hypothesis that online hate
10 | Online hate speech in NZ

exposure increases in a “social climate of fear, uncertainty, and polarization” (p. 90) as around
47% of respondents had encountered online hate during 2013, while 74% did so in 2015.
As described above, over the years research interest in online hate speech has moved from
the proliferation of hateful websites and online groups to the prevalence of exposure,
particularly among children and young adults, and the implementation of approaches to
mitigate online hate. However, in reviewing the literature, we have also found that New
Zealand lacks statistical insights about this issue. This study tries to address the knowledge
gap by looking at one specific aspect: the self-reported experiences of online hate among
adult New Zealanders in general. The next section of this report describes the
methodological approach that guided this study.

11 | Online hate speech in NZ

Methodology
Currently, there is a lack of statistical insights about online hate speech in New Zealand. For
this reason, we adopted an approach that mainly relied on numerical data. Our approach was
pertinent and timely to support current national discussion on the topic. The objectives of the
study were to explore the self-reported experiences of New Zealand adults regarding online
hate speech and their exposure to this type of content. To the best of our knowledge, this
study is the first of its kind in the country.
The research questions that guided the study were:
•

What are the personal experiences of adult New Zealanders regarding online hate
speech in the prior year?

•

What is the extent of exposure to online hate speech among adult New Zealanders?

As described in the Background section, there is no consensus on the definition of online
hate speech. However, in order to answer the research questions, we used a working
definition based on previous social and behavioural research on the topic, which has also
applied quantitative methodology, particularly surveys, as the technique for data collection. In
doing so, we sought to obtain results that, to some extent, can be compared with those
informing our study. In this sense, we define online hate speech as:

any technology-mediated speech or digital communication that
offends, discriminates, denigrates, abuses and/or disparages a
person(s) on the basis of a group-defining characteristic such as race,
ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability,
and others (Kaakinen et al., 2018; Schmidt & Wiegand, 2017).
In the following sub-sections, we describe the data collection technique used for the study,
the characteristics of the research sample, aspects related to research ethics, and the
limitations of the study.

Survey tool
The instrument for data collection was an online survey. The use of online surveys for
government, academic, and commercial research is widespread. The advantage of using this
type of research instrument, compared to traditional paper-based surveys, is that it allows
access to a larger sample, incurs lower administrative costs, and provides higher flexibility as
well as greater efficiency (Evans & Mathur, 2005). Despite these benefits, a downside is that it
is restricted to the online population (Bryman, 2008). However, this last point was not an issue
for this study as we were interested in gathering data from adults that typically navigate
online. Furthermore, recent research on online hate speech has successfully used online
surveys as the means for data collection (see Costello et al., 2016, 2017, Hawdon et al., 2014,
2017).

12 | Online hate speech in NZ

The development of the research instrument for this study was informed by available
international research on the topic (Costello et al., 2016; Hawdon et al., 2017; Kaakinen et al.,
2018; Keipi et al., 2016). While most of these studies looked at online hate exposure, our
survey also explored personal experiences of online hate speech. We also relied on Netsafe’s
operational experience with reported cases of online hate to refine survey questions and/or
scaling responses. Similarly, we received feedback from experts on the field and key
stakeholders regarding our research design. Data collection was administered by Colmar
Brunton and took place during June 2018. The online survey was piloted before going live.
The survey questionnaire included six questions5. The first question measured participants’
personal experiences of online hate speech in the last 12 months. We focused on the
prevalence and frequency of these experiences. The scale of responses included: never,
once, a few times (2-4), many times (5 or more), and I don’t know. Then, those participants
who said they had experienced online hate were asked a follow-up question regarding
perceived reasons for being the target of hateful content. For this question the list of options
included race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation among others.
While we primarily sought to gather quantitative data, our online survey included an openended question that provided us with some qualitative data about the impact of online hate
from the perspective of those who were targeted with it. We collected useful insights based
on participants’ own words and views, but, as we only included one open-ended question, the
value of and need for further qualitative evidence in future research became apparent to us.
Subsequent survey questions measured exposure to online hate. Note that by exposure we
meant seeing or encountering hateful content targeting someone else. In this respect, we
asked all participants whether they have been exposed to hateful content in the last 12
months. We consistently applied the scale used to measure personal experiences, which, as
previously described, included the following options: never, once, a few times (2-4), many
times (5 or more), and I don’t know. Then, participants who were exposed to online hate
answered a question about the reasons they believed others were targeted with hateful
content.
The last survey question sought to measure participants’ engagement with online sites that
promote or distribute hateful content. Specifically, we asked them to indicate whether they
have intentionally visited such a website, online forum and/or social media group.

Sample
The study collected data from New Zealanders aged 18+. A total of 1,001 participants
completed the online survey. Colmar Brunton sampled participants from its online research
panel, offering them incentives for participation. The use of survey panels is argued to
increase the validity of responses as participants recruited from these panels tend to be more
serious about answering survey questions (Wansink, 2001). The demographic details
provided by the participants included information such as age, gender, ethnicity, and location.
Regarding gender, females represented 52% of the total sample while males made up the
remaining 47.7%. Only 0.03% of participants identified as gender diverse. In terms of ethnicity
our sample was distributed as follows: NZ European/Pākehā (71%), Māori (11%), Pacific (5%),
Asian (11%), and other ethnicity (9%). Māori and Pacific sub-populations were deliberately
‘boosted’ beyond what would be achieved in a random sample to ensure representation.
Data about sexual orientation6 was also collected. As there were relatively few respondents
who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or other, these respondents were grouped as nonheterosexual (n=62) to make statistically robust comparisons with heterosexual respondents.
This approach is common in survey-based research.
Data collected from this representative sample allowed the analysis of sub-groups. The
margin of error was +/- 3.1% at 95% confidence on total results.

Research ethics
As previously indicated, this research is part of a larger project that looks at New Zealanders’
experiences of digital risks and harm. Because of the sensitive nature of the topics involved,
we provided participants with pertinent information about the purposes of the study, asked
them for their consent to participate, and guaranteed that their responses were confidential
and that their data will be kept protected. Colmar Brunton, in coordination with Netsafe, also
followed industry standards included in the Research Association’s Code of Practice. The
research instrument was piloted to identify whether there was any risk of causing distress to
the respondents. On-screen links to relevant services, including Netsafe’s help service, were
also provided to participants when they were responding to the survey. We also included an
email address so those participants who required further information about the project were
able to reach us.

Limitations
While we have tried to follow the tenets that underpin rigour in social science research to
explore the nature and impact of online hate speech in New Zealand, we are also aware of
the limitations of our approach.
First, while our findings rely on representative data, our questionnaire was short, comprising
only six questions due to practical issues. Therefore, the findings provide a broad picture of
online hate speech in New Zealand. We have tried to manage this challenge by including an
open-ended question, so participants could freely share their own views and expand further
on the topic.
Second, we acknowledge that self-reported data are subject to respondents’ personal
perspectives, and that they might have different definitions of hate speech. Another limitation
is that the study collected data from a specific point of time. As previously described,
evidence suggests that the dissemination and, thus, exposure to hateful content online might
be influenced by context (e.g. a terrorist attack, intense media coverage on a sensitive topic, a
policy decision etc.). At the time of data collection, there were no specific controversial
political or social events that generated public attention in New Zealand. This point needs to
be considered in the interpretation and comparison of results.

15 | Online hate speech in NZ

Findings
This section presents findings about adult New Zealanders’ personal experiences of and
exposure to online hate speech in the last 12 months. It also reports on perceived reasons for
receiving hateful content, the impact of online hate, and participants’ intentions to visit online
environments (e.g. websites, online forums, social media) that target people because of their
personal identity and/or beliefs. Differences in terms of key demographics such as age,
gender, and ethnicity, are also described in this section.

Personal experiences and frequency of online hate speech
Highlights
• 1 in 10 adults reported to have personally experienced online hate speech in the
prior year.
• Online hate mainly targets male, minority ethnic as well as younger age groups.
•

There is indication of a higher rate among those identified as non-heterosexual.

Survey participants were asked whether they have personally received a digital
communication that offended, discriminated against, denigrated, abused and/or disparaged
them because of their race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, age,
disability, and/or other characteristics. While a large majority (83%) answered negatively, 11%
said they have experienced online hate speech in person one or more times in the last 12
months (Figure 1). Of those participants who answered positively, half experienced online hate
speech 2-4 times.

The data also shows that personal experiences of online hate speech were more common
among minority ethnic groups. Aggregated data shows that 16% of Asian participants
experienced online hate speech one or more times in the prior year. They were followed by
those who identified themselves as an ‘other’ ethnicity (14%) and then Māori and Pacific

Interestingly, as also evident in Table 1, the percentage of those who experienced online hate
speech a few times was higher among participants with ‘other’ ethnic backgrounds (10%).
Also, compared to other ethnic groups, for Asian and Pacific respondents it was more
common to be the target of online hate only once: 8% and 7%, respectively.
In regard to age, experiences of online hate speech varied with participants in the younger
age groups more commonly receiving this type of content (see Table 2). This was the case for
those aged 18-29 and 30-39 years old: 16% and 18%, respectively.

Respondents with a disability who answered the online survey also indicated that they
experienced online hate at a higher rate compared to non-disabled participants. As Figure 4

participants without impairments.

The online survey also gathered data about online hate in the context of participants’ sexual
orientation (see Table 3). About 9% of those who identified themselves as heterosexual
indicated to have received hateful digital communications one or more times in the prior year.
However, for non-heterosexual participants (e.g. gay, lesbian) the rate was higher, with 26% of
them receiving such communications.

Perceived reasons for receiving online hate speech
Highlights
• Religion followed by political views, appearance, race, and ethnicity were the most
frequent reasons behind online hate speech.
• Males believed they were targeted mainly because of their religion, race, political
views, and ethnicity.
• Females, meanwhile, concurred on religion but considered gender and age
significantly higher than males.

Survey participants who reported receiving online hate in the prior year (n=112) were asked to
indicate the reasons for being targeted by this kind of digital communication. Overall, religion
was mentioned as the most frequent reason followed by appearance, political views and race.
Ethnicity and nationality were also mentioned. For details see Figure 5.

In terms of gender, male and female participants considered ‘religion’ to be the most frequent
reason for receiving online hate speech. However, these two groups weighted other motives
differently. As Figure 6 describes, for male participants ethnicity, political views and race
were, for example, some of the most frequent reasons behind their personal experiences of
online hate speech. On the other hand, responses regarding gender and age as motivations
for receiving hateful digital communications were rated significantly higher by females
compared to males.

In terms of ethnicity, most participants from minority ethnic groups concurred that their
ethnicity was the reason for being targeted with hateful content online. Participants of Asian
backgrounds mentioned that their ethnicity (42%) and religion (28%) were the most frequent
reasons for receiving online hate. Meanwhile, those who identified themselves as part of
‘other’ ethnic groups said that motivations based on their race (44%) and ethnicity (42%) were
used to target them. For their part, Māori also highlighted ethnicity (36%) and race (33%) as
motivations. In contrast, Pacific respondents pointed out race (31%) and religion (26%), while

Reasons for being the target of online hate also differed according to age. In this respect, for
young participants, those aged 18-29 years, sexual orientation was the most common reason
followed by appearance and political views. In contrast, an older age group (30-39 years old)
rated political views, religion and appearance as frequent reasons, whilst 40-to-49-year old
respondents indicated that their ethnicity was the most common cause of being targeted with
hateful digital communications followed by their religion and appearance.
On the other hand, participants who identified themselves as non-heterosexual indicated that
their sexual orientation was the most common reason for receiving online hate speech.
Meanwhile, for heterosexual respondents the main perceived reason for being targeted by
hate speech was for religious reasons.

Self-reported impact of online hate speech
Highlights
• More than half reported that online hate speech had a negative impact, mainly
emotionally but also on their behaviour and daily activities.
• Descriptions of emotional impact included anger, sadness, fear, and frustration
among others; however for some online hate also affected their social interactions,
sleep and/or work.
•

Despite being targeted, a third indicated not being personally affected by online
hate.

The online survey also gathered qualitative data through an open-ended question. We asked
those participants who said they were personally targeted with online hate (n=112) to describe
the impact that this experience had on them. The purpose of the question was to collect data
based on participants’ own words and explore in more detail their experiences of online hate
in relation to potential harm and distress.
Participants’ comments were coded and then grouped into main categories and themes. Our
analysis was reflective and iterative. We categorised participants’ responses in terms of
affective/emotional and behavioural impact. The following sub-sections describe these two
aspects in more detail.
Of the 112 participants who responded to the question, 6 in 10 commented that online hate
speech had either an affective and/or behavioural impact on them. A third of respondents, in
contrast, mentioned that although they were targeted, they were not affected by the hateful
digital communication – see Figure 7.

Affective impact. Of those who said they were negatively affected by online hate speech,
most reported a range of emotional reactions. Those in this category described, for instance,
having been “angry”, “gutted”, “upset”, “stressed” or “anxious”. A young Māori female
respondent, who identified herself as lesbian, remarked, for example, that it was hurtful “that
other people felt negative towards something I couldn't change about myself” and that it was
worse when “such attitude was communicated online”. Some participants who had moved to
New Zealand also described the emotional impact caused by online hate. A young male (1829 years old) from India, for example, commented that after being targeted with hateful
content because of his nationality he felt “not welcome”, and thus “not included as part of the
wider community” despite “working hard” for it. For his part, another respondent, also from
India, said he was “ashamed of being in New Zealand”. A related experience was described
by a New Zealand born female participant whose Cook Island Māori background, she said,
was the reason for receiving online hate:

When I first received these texts I was a bit confused…As a 59 year old
in all my life I had never been told I was a fat ugly black coconut bitch
that should go back where I came from. Hence the confusion.
Everyone who knows me knows I am NZ born. By the 3rd text I had
been called every bad name under the sun…when you are telling
someone you are wrong several times you get really frustrated.
There were other participants who used terms such as “sad”, “low”, “down”, “scared” or
“humiliated” to describe the emotional impact of online hate speech. Among them, a young
female participant indicated that she also felt “guilty”, while another in the same age range
(18-29 years old) was “very insecure”. Both respondents commented they were targeted
because of their appearance. Another participant reflected on how distressing online hate
can be.

24 | Online hate speech in NZ

This middle-aged woman who identified herself as NZ European/Pākehā pointed out the
following:

Sad, because you know these are people’s true thoughts and opinions.
People are faceless when they make comments on the internet, some
shoot straight from the mouth, unaware of their broad (and silent)
audience, others do it because they ‘know’ the audience is broad and
that they are likely to attract attention.
One aspect that surfaced from the data was not only the descriptions of emotional impact but
also, in a few cases, participants’ signs of resilience to deal with online hate. In this respect,
one respondent said that he “was hurt inside” but then he “brushed it off”. Another
commented that although online hate “pissed me off”, he “refused to dwell on it”. A young
female participant whose religion was the cause of receiving hateful content also said, “it
made me feel a little sick and attacked” but soon she stopped paying attention to the
situation.
Behavioural impact. For some participants the impact of online hate also extended to their
everyday lives, in other words their behaviour and the activities they normally do. This was
the case for a few participants who indicated avoiding “leaving the house sometimes” or
being “scared to come out in public”. A young female respondent said that she was “pushed
away from family” while another commented that her sleep was not only affected, but also
she started overeating to compensate for the distress. For some participants online hate
speech affected work. Among them, a male (30-39 years old) who received hateful content
targeting his nationality, commented that the experience “made me incredibly uncomfortable
at work”. For another, a middle-aged male respondent (40-49 years old), the impact was more
severe as he stopped working after being targeted because of his disability.
For some there was a sense that online hate speech affected the way they interact with
others and participate online. For example, a mature female participant (40-49 years old) said
that “for a few months” she did not “talk to many people as I couldn't tell my side of things”.
Another female commented that online hate targeting her gender and age made her
withdraw from the online group she used to participate in, and since then, she has “never
returned, even though all the other people in that group were my friends”. A third participant
indicated she became “wary of what I share on social media”.
Similarly, in response to receiving online hate others changed their daily use of digital
technologies. This was the case for one respondent, a middle-aged Samoan participant, who
said he now spends less time online and on the phone. Another participant commented that
he was “angry” with online hate that targeted his political views and as a result he had “to
stop using the website or app”. Despite reporting “very little” emotional impact, one
participant, on the other hand, indicated that he decided to unfriend from social media the
person who sent him content targeting his political views and religion. Others preferred to
block the sender. In another case, the positive role of online peer support was also
highlighted over blocking or unfriending.

25 | Online hate speech in NZ

This was the case for a middle-aged female respondent who was sent online hate because of
her religion:

I was somewhat distressed, but pleased to note that I did not have to
reply, as others already intervened on my behalf.
On the other hand, another interesting aspect that emerged from peoples’ comments was
that, for some, online hate speech is part of the risks of interacting in the digital environment.
One participant indicated that online hate is frustrating, but he had to accept it “as the norm
for online interaction”. Another participant complemented this point by saying that “it’s the
way life is now”. A third respondent commented:

I don't let it affect me – there is lots of opinions, rights and wrongs and
a whole lot of people that enjoy others’ misfortunes. I remind myself of
that and continue to scroll.

Exposure to online hate speech
Highlights
•
•

About 3 in 10 have seen or been exposed to online hate speech targeting
someone else
Exposure to online hate was more common among participants within ‘other’
ethnic groups

In addition to measuring personal experiences, the survey included a question intended to
gauge exposure to online hate speech. More precisely, we asked participants to indicate
whether they have seen or been exposed to a hateful digital communication that targeted
someone or a group because of their race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual orientation,
religion, age, disability, and/or other attribute. All participants answered the question. While
over a half of respondents (62%) indicated not having encountered this sort of online content
in the last 12 months, 28% of them responded affirmatively. The remaining 10% of participants
indicated they did not know whether they have been exposed to online hate – see Figure 8.

Exposure to online hate speech was also more common among younger age groups. As
Table 5 shows, those aged 18 to 29 (40%) and 30 to 39 years old (39%) reported the highest
percentage of online hate exposure targeting others. These age groups were followed by
those aged 40-49 years with 29% – see Table 5.

In terms of ethnicity, for participants who chose the category ‘other’ to describe their ethnicity,
exposure to online hate speech was significantly higher compared to other ethnic groups
(see Table 6). Some 41% of respondents in this group indicated having encountered or seen
online hate one or more times in the past year. In comparison, percentages were lower but
still significant among Māori (30%) and Asian (29%) followed by NZ European/Pākehā (27%)
and Pacific (25%) participants.

On the other hand, the difference in online hate exposure in the context of gender was not
statistically significant. In this respect, 29% of female participants and 27% of males indicated
having encountered hateful content online in the past year. Regarding sexual orientation,
over a half of non-heterosexual participants (55%) indicated having seen or encountered
hateful content while 30% said they were not exposed to it and 15% indicated they did not
know whether they have seen any. In the case of heterosexual respondents, exposure to
online hate was less common (26%), with most participants in this group (65%) answering they
have not seen it in the prior year.

Perceived reasons for online hate speech against others
Highlights
• Participants who were exposed to online hate believed that others were more
commonly targeted because of their religion, race and/or ethnicity.
• For both NZ European/Pākehā and those who identified within the ‘other’ ethnic
category the main reason was religion. Māori and Pacific respondents pointed out
race whilst Asians highlighted ethnicity.

Survey participants who reported to have been exposed to online hate in the prior year
(n=285) were asked to indicate the reasons they think others were targeted. Figure 9
describes that for these participants religion, race, and ethnicity were the most common
motives behind the hateful content they were exposed to.
On the other hand, while different age groups mostly highlighted the same reasons behind
online hate, the importance of these reasons was, in some cases, rated differently. For
example, participants aged 18-29 years old indicated that the online hate they were exposed
to targeted others because of their race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Meanwhile, those
aged 30-39 and 40-49 years old considered that religion, race, and ethnicity were the main
motives. For older participants (50-59 and 60-69) hateful content online was mainly motivated

political views, and race.

In terms of gender, our findings indicate that, in general, male and female participants
concurred on the reasons why others were the target of online hate speech (e.g. religion,
race). However, interestingly, females’ responses in relation to physical appearance were
largely higher compared to males’ answers. On the other hand, males’ views about sexual
orientation and gender as motivations for hateful online content against others were
significantly higher compared to those from females. Further details are shown in Figure 10.

In terms of ethnicity, NZ European/Pākehā considered that the motivations behind the online
hate they were exposed to followed this order: religion, race and political views. Māori, on the
other hand, indicated that it was mainly race but also ethnicity and political views. Pacific
respondents, meanwhile, pointed out race and then ethnicity along with sexual orientation
and religion. For Asian participants who encountered online hate the reasons were ethnicity,
race and religion. Finally, those who identified themselves as in an ‘other’ ethnic group
highlighted the most common reasons for online hate in the following order: religion, race,
and ethnicity. Details are given in Table 7.

Engagement with online sites promoting/distributing online
hate speech
Highlights
•

In the prior year, 1 in 20 have intentionally visited a website, online forum
and/or social media site that promotes or distributes online hate speech

•

Among those who did so, the behaviour was more common among males,
young people under 30 years old, and those who identified themselves as
non-heterosexual

The last survey question asked participants whether in the prior year they have intentionally
visited a website, online forum and/or social media group that targets people because of their
race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, and/or other
characteristic. Overall, intentional engagement with this type of online environment was
uncommon among survey participants.

Discussion and Conclusion
This report has presented findings from an exploratory study about online hate speech in
New Zealand. It has found that 1 in 10 adult New Zealanders report being personally targeted
by online hate speech, and that 3 in 10 have seen or encountered hateful content online one
or more times in the prior year. In addition to measuring prevalence and frequency, the
results include insights about people’s perceived reasons for being targeted, the impact of
online hate as well as the intentionality of people’s engagement with online spaces (e.g.
forums, websites, social media) promoting hateful digital communications. Findings presented
in this report are based on nationally representative data focusing on key demographics such
as age, gender, and ethnicity.
A significant finding is that online hate speech in New Zealand is more likely to target
minorities. Our research has uncovered that members of minority ethnic groups, particularly
Asians, non-heterosexual people (e.g. gay, lesbian, bisexual), and people with disabilities
were more commonly targeted with hateful content online. These findings relate to
international research and debate about the prevalence of online hate against vulnerable
groups (see Foxman & Wolf, 2013; Waldron, 2012). Equally important are the results that
depict the negative impact of online hate. In most cases and to different degrees, adult New
Zealanders described the emotional impact they have experienced as a result of online hate
directed to them. Furthermore, as our qualitative data show, some have been more affected,
resulting in their inability to socially interact or carry on with their everyday lives. These
findings are an invitation for further reflection about online hate speech. While discussion in
New Zealand has mainly looked at the legal and ethical challenges surrounding online hate,
the social aspect that involves understanding the experiences, needs and views of specific
groups, communities, and people as individuals also must be considered.
Similarly, the study has found that online hate varies with age. As the finding shows, personal
experiences of and exposure to hateful content online are more common among youth and
younger adults. This is consistent with international research (Costello et al., 2016; Hawdon et
al., 2014; Kaakinen et al., 2018) and supports the idea that studying online hate in the context
of young people is particularly relevant. An explanation for this finding might be that online
hate groups actively seek to recruit or influence people from younger age groups, as some
commentators suggest (see Blaya, 2018; Lee & Leets, 2002) and/or that youths tend to be
actively engaged with digital tools, especially social media, compared with older age groups
(Hawdon et al., 2014). This age difference regarding online hate also has implications for
practice. Not only does online hate target – or is more often encountered by – young people
but it is more likely to affect them negatively. A recent Netsafe study suggests, for instance,
that young people in New Zealand are more vulnerable to the impact of unwanted digital
communications (see Netsafe, 2018b).
Interestingly, a surprising finding relates to personal experiences of online hate and gender.
Available research has shown that females are more likely to be on the receiving end of
online harassment and other forms of risky and abusive online behaviours (Duggan, 2017;
Henry & Powell, 2018; Ministry for Women, 2017; Netsafe, 2018b; Staude-Müller, Hansen, &
Voss, 2012). We were expecting a similar pattern. However, our data show that, in the context
of online hate speech, males were more commonly targeted than females. Although the
gender difference in our study is relatively modest, this finding might be explained by the
higher rate of males’ responses about ethnicity, race and political views, which along with
34 | Online hate speech in NZ

religion are top reasons for being targeted with online hate speech. However, on the other
hand, it also must be noted that gender and age-related online hate were significantly more
common among females.
Our study also offers interesting insights about who in New Zealand has intentionally visited
an online site(s) that promotes or distributes hateful content. We know now that, in the last 12
months, about 5% of adults visited a website, online forum and/or social media site that
promoted hateful content, and that this behaviour was more common among males, youths
and young adults under 30 years old, Asians, and those who identified themselves as nonheterosexual. However, while these demographic characteristics are relevant, we are unable
to make further interpretations and conclusions based on our data. We recommend
interpreting the meaning of these figures cautiously. For example, intentionally visiting an
online hate forum does not explain motivations for visiting a forum, level of engagement with
its content and interaction with its members, nor alignment with the ideology promoted. The
use of other dependent variables such as types of online engagement and political views will
be required in further research to understand this matter in more depth.
Finally, as online hate speech is a highly complex topic, we acknowledge that our study only
offers a general look at it and has some challenges and limitations, explained in the
Methodology section of this report. We think the understanding of online hate demands the
use of other types of methodologies and research techniques as well as rigorous exploration
of other aspects of this phenomenon. For this reason, we suggest avenues for future research
such as studying in more detail those groups more commonly targeted, the motivations to
engage with this online behaviour as well as the effectiveness of approaches (computational,
legal, educational) to prevent or mitigate online hate. Longitudinal research or research
conducted during a specific timeframe (e.g. general elections) will also help to further
understand the nature and impact of online hate speech in New Zealand.

Glossary
Digital communication: A digital communication refers to any form of electronic
communication as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015. This includes any
text message, writing, picture, recording, or other matter that is communicated electronically.
Digital harm and distress: To describe experiences of digital harm and/or distress we
consider two elements: affective and behavioural. Affective is how a person describes feeling
about a situation of unwanted digital communication (e.g. annoyed, anxious, unsafe). It is the
internal experience of emotional reaction to it. Behavioural refers to the impact of an
unwanted digital communication(s) on the person’s daily activities (e.g. unable to leave the
house as a result of being anxious or feeling unsafe).
Unwanted digital communications: Unwanted digital communications include a range of
online experience(s) mediated/facilitated by unsolicited electronic communication(s) that
might or might not cause distress and/or harm to the person who deals with it (e.g. receiving
spam, accidentally seeing inappropriate content, having rumours spread about oneself, being
threatened online).
Gender: The social and cultural construction based on the expectation of what it means to be
a man and/or a woman, including roles, expectations, and behaviour. The concept of gender
diversity acknowledges this full range of genders. Societies, and cultures within societies,
have different constructs and expectations of gender and this can vary over time (Statistics
NZ, n.d.).
Sexual orientation: A person’s sexual orientation can be derived from their sexual attraction,
sexual behaviour, and/or sexual identity. It includes, for example, lesbian, gay, bisexual,
queer, heterosexual, and asexual (Statistics NZ, n.d.).
