Abstract
News media have transformed over the last decades, with rising online news suppliers and an
increase in online news consumption. We examine how reporting on immigration differs
between popular German online and print media over three crucial years of the so-called
immigration crisis, from 2015 to 2017. This study extends knowledge on framing of the crisis
by examining a period covering start, peak, and the time after the intake of refugees. Moreover,
we establish whether online and print reporting differs in terms of both frame occurrence and
variability. The period of the crisis provided an ideal test to see whether the focus of media
reporting differed between online and print sources. Employing a most similar cases design
based on (autonomous) online and print versions of three major German news outlets, we
extract the dominant frames in almost 18,500 articles using algorithm-based topic modelling.
While results indicate that many frames are more visible in either online or print media, these
differences often do not follow theoretical expectations. Furthermore, online media are
dominated more by particular frames and, hence, show less diversity than print media.
However, important key events happening during our period of investigation do not affect
overall diversity of frames.

1 Introduction
In the last two decades, news media have transformed, giving rise to online news content
provided by online-only sources as well as online versions of print outlets. News content
nowadays comes from a much wider range of sources through news aggregators and via social
media compared to times of dominant print and television news (Lee and Chyi, 2015). Yet, has
news content also become more diverse in an age of increased availability via online news or
not?
News consumption on online devices has increased and changed the behavior especially
for younger consumers (Bakker, 2013; Boumans, Trilling, Vliegenthart, and Boomgaarden,
2018). Due to online availability of a large variety of news, many people now “snack” and

“graze” (Molyneux, 2018) from several news sources. The myth that people who read their
news online are only exposed to like-minded topics and viewpoint through filter bubbles has
been debunked (Zuiderveen Borgesius et al., 2016). Allegedly, however, online news
consumption can still create a new type of ‘bubble’ due to a more limited range of exposure in
terms of frame variety, as the content of online news outlets relies more heavily on the same
news agencies (Boumans et al., 2018). The comparison of the content of online versus print
news has received little scholarly attention (Dimitrova and Strömback, 2009; Reich, 2016),
which is particularly true regarding the comparison of differences in the usage of frames. We
aim to fill this lacuna by examining which frames appeared during the German immigration
crisis and did they appear similarly in online and print news?
Online news media have the potential to differ from their print counterparts in terms of
length, sheer number of articles (Jacobi, Kleinen-von Königslöw, and Ruigrok, 2016), and
content. The overarching concepts of convergence, immediacy, and interactivity (Karlsson and
Strömbäck, 2010) cause online media to be more flexible but leave journalists with less time
for fact-checking and reflection. Consequently, online journalism becomes more reliant on
news agencies (Boumans et al., 2018) and imitation (Buhl, Günther, and Quandt, 2016). Does
this reduce the variety in content and applied frames?
Despite these differences, academics interested in longitudinal news media (effects)
have mainly turned to print sources, which then function as a proxy of news media content as
a whole (see e.g., Boomgaarden and Vliegenthart, 2007; Czymara and Dochow, 2018; van
Klingeren, Boomgaarden, Vliegenthart, and De Vreese, 2015). Whether this assumption is
unproblematic remains so far unanswered. Furthermore, since mostly younger people use
online sources for their news consumption (Mitchelstein and Boczkowski, 2010; Trilling and
Schoenbach, 2015), any differences between online and print media potentially lead to a
generation gap in perceptions based on news media content. It is therefore important to know
more about the content of these news media.
To study news framing in online and print media, we rely on articles published in
Germany during the European immigration crisis from January 2015 to December 2017. It is
especially during crises that news media play a vital role in getting information across. Their
coverage provides a signaling function of key events (Czymara and Schmidt-Catran, 2017);
their patterns in terms of frames, topics, and connotations can affect public discourse and
attitudes towards the issue (Boomgaarden and Vliegenthart, 2007; Czymara and Dochow, 2018;
Trilling, van Klingeren, and Tsfati, 2016; van Klingeren et al., 2015; van Klingeren,
Boomgaarden and de Vreese, 2017). We selected this particular period because media tend to
reinvent themselves during crises. The unexpected nature of crises disrupts normal newsmaking routines and creates an opening for the creation and formation of new perspectives and
frames (Schultz, Kleinnijenhuis, Oegema, Utz, and Van Atteveldt, 2012; Snow, Vliegenthart,
and Corrigall-Brown, 2007). The question is, however, whether this happens similarly in online
and in print media.
Greussing and Boomgaarden (2017) studied the developments of frames in Austrian
media during the first year of the crisis (i.e., 2015), while Heidenreich, Lind, Eberl, and
Boomgaarden (2019) investigated framing of the crisis across five countries over the first two
years. We contribute to this literature by investigating framing in Germany, one of the main
political players of the European immigration crisis (Czymara, 2020; Heizmann and Ziller,
2020), over the complete three-year time span, also covering the time after the initial peak of
refugee inflow. Furthermore, we exceed existing knowledge by moving beyond sole descriptive
analyses, as we theorize and apply the trilogy of online media characteristics’ immediacy,
interactivity, and convergence (Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010) to derive expectations.
We compare the content of articles on the immigration crisis of the online and print
versions of three major German newspapers and news magazines, namely, Die Zeit, Der

Spiegel, and Die Welt. All three outlets have autonomous online output, making them an ideal
most similar cases design. The selection of different publishing formats of the same news
outlets yields a systematic but also conservative comparison. After discussing theoretical
expectations and introducing the German case and our six outlets, we identify the frames that
were present during the period of investigation. We use topic modeling, an inductive machinelearning approach, for our content analysis. Subsequently, we examine whether there are
structural differences in the presence and variety of the frames between online and print media.
This relates to differences in the frames’ overall salience but also to differences in their
development over time as well as the diversity of frame usage.
Immigration discourses in mass media
Framing literature provides many definitions of the concept. With the application of automated
content analysis, discussion arises on whether frames can be measured automatically (see, e.g.,
Van der Meer, Verhoeven, Beentjes, and Vliegenthart, 2016). Automated content analyses
usually do not capture aspect like nuances, irony, pictures, or references. However, one can
establish the ‘sauce’ that is poured onto an issue. The definition applied in this study therefore
interprets frames as a certain angle, formed by means of selection and choice of words, or by
zooming in on a specific part of an issue (Tewksbury and Scheufele, 2007).
Prior research suggests that frame usage in immigration news is highly dependent on
immigrant group, news outlet, and context (see, e.g., Heidenreich et al., 2019; Jacobs, Meeusen,
and D’Haenens, 2018; Kroon, Trilling, Van Selm, and Vliegenthart, 2019; Lind and Meltzer,
2020; Wallace, 2018). Yet, several overarching frame-clusters reoccur. These are victimization
frames (Van Gorp, 2005), which focus on refugees as being victims of circumstances and their
need for help. Second, problematizing frames (Bennett, Ter Wal, Lipinski, Fabiszak, and
Krzyzanowski, 2013; Goodman and Speer, 2007; Horsti, 2007) cover aspects like crime,
terrorism, or illegality. Third, there are the economic consequences of a migration frame (Madra
and Adaman, 2014; Quinsaat, 2013). This can include consequences for local economies or the
welfare state. Dehumanization frames (Esser and Matthes, 2013) describe the magnitude of the
arriving group and the powerlessness related to their arrival; they also relate to a we/them
perspective and thus often have a polarizing nature.
Crises are interesting times regarding frame formation, as they mostly happen
unexpectedly and disrupt normal routines in the creation of news, fade norms, and affect policy
formation. They create an opening for new interpretations to take shape. In news media, this
often results in a wide range of old and new frames at the very beginning of a crisis, which
crystalizes as time passes (Schultz et al., 2012; Snow et al., 2007). Since the refugee crisis is an
uncommon event, prior studies examining media reporting on refugees in other European
countries also found frames which are more specifically coined to the political-historical
context, such as settlement, border situation, refugee accommodation, refugee movement, and
unaccompanied children (Greussing and Boomgaarden, 2017; Heidenreich et al., 2019).
Following the lead of these previous scholars, we use an exploratory method to establish frames
in our analyses. Our first research question is:
RQ1: Which frames appeared during the German immigration crisis, and how did they
develop?
Different frame occurrence in print and online news media
One might assume that the general content of print news and their online counterparts are highly
similar, as they influence one another (Welbers, Van Atteveldt, Kleinnijenhuis, Ruigrok, and

Schaper, 2016). However, their content may also differ because of the differences in
functionalities and possibilities. The news market has become increasingly competitive through
the widespread availability of news. This triggered a move from craft norms towards a serving
of the marketplace (McManus, 1995). Online media make it particularly easy to observe
audience behavior. In craving people’s attention, analytics of clicks and views play a central
role in daily journalism (Welbers et al., 2016), affecting editorial decisions with regard to
newsworthiness and article position (Lee, Lewis, and Powers, 2014). Consequently, online
news is often seen as more flexible and responsive than traditional news.
Karlsson and Strömbäck (2010) provide one of the most comprehensive definition of
online news. They describe it as 1) interactive, which may affect text and content as well as
user-behavior (e.g., Cover, 2006; Ksiazek, Peer, and Lessard, 2016). Steuer (1992) described
interactivity as “the extent to which users can participate in modifying the form and content of
a mediated environment in real time” (p. 84). This includes ‘read more’ buttons, response boxes
and other ways to co-create news messages but also adjusting the headlines to attracting
attention most and adjusting content to viewer behavior; 2) convergent, given that news
websites can merge several elements of traditional media together (see Marshall and Burnett,
2003), transforming it into a multi-media platform; and 3) immediate, as information is posted
promptly online. The question is, however, how these characteristics of online news affect its
content, or more specifically:
RQ2: How do aspects of interactivity, convergence, and immediacy affect frame usage,
and (how) does online news differ from print news on the immigration crisis?
Because news is increasingly tailored to what sells, we argue – given the opportunities to attract
new audiences and bring information when it is still ‘fresh’ – that this competition is even
fiercer online. The fact that news media are more interactive and rely for their audience on
‘clickbait’ captions and ‘need-to-know’ information, selecting the right terms (or frames) is
essential in order to wheel them in. Online news can be made attractive in terms of excitement,
by adding sensational elements to a story or headline (i.e., clickbait). While this can also be the
case for print media, there is less direct competition and therefore less of a necessity.
Sensationalism is often defined as the capability to increase attention or provoke arousing
responses (see Grabe, Zhou, and Barnett, 2001) and has been related to feelings of sensation
that occur in situations that are deemed dangerous for human survival or reproduction (Davis
and McLeod, 2003; Shoemaker, 1996). Given our argument that online news is more sensitive
to competition, we hypothesize that:
H1a) Online news applies sensationalist frames more often than the print counterparts,
H1b) whereas we expect no differences regarding other kinds of frames.
Diversity of frame-usage
Convergence means that journalists are not confined to words and pictures printed on paper
since they can connect a story to videos, audio, and livestreams (Greer and Mensing, 2006).
Moreover, online audiences tend to want their information fast and are easily distracted by other
news or online activities (Neuberger, Nuernbergk, and Rischke, 2007). This means that stories
might be shorter, and the message needs to be clear and concise. Consequentially, there should
be less space for elaborate framing in online news articles.
The fact that online news is more immediate is bound to affect the diversity of its
content. Journalists may rely more heavily on known structures and information because there
is less time to investigate alternative perspectives. Immediacy can also cause online journalism

to rely more heavily on unaltered texts provided by news agencies (Boumans et al., 2018).
Overall, diversity in perspectives is pressured under time constraints, and journalists might rely
more on the interactive component of the medium, such as comments and user, to add nuance
to a story. We hypothesize that:
H2: Online news provides a less diverse selection of frames than print news does.
Research on framing during crises has shown a broadening of perspectives around the ‘climax’
of a crisis, followed by a period of ‘frame crystallization’ during which few frames dominate
(Schultz et al., 2012; Snow et al., 2007). We argue that the immigration crisis consisted of
several important events, or climaxes, that may have triggered a similar response. As these
events affect both online and print newsrooms, they have the potential to cause a high level of
diversity in both types of news sources, thereby making online and print news outlets more
alike in this respect.
However, given that online news attains higher levels of immediacy, another option is
that online news is less flexible. Time-constrains play an even bigger role around key events,
where every source wants to be the first with the latest scoop. This could lead to diversity being
a time-consuming luxury that only print news can afford (Reich, 2016). Diversity in content
and framing may hence diminish in online news during key events (Buhl, Günther, and Quandt,
2016). These opposing perspectives lead to the following two hypotheses:
H3a: Key-events generally spark greater diversity in frame usage, and this is similarly
true for both online and print media.
H3b: Key-events spark greater diversity in frame usage in print news compared to
online news articles, thereby increasing differences between both.
2 Data and methodology
The case
Germany fulfilled a leading role within Europe during the crisis but held a somewhat ambiguous
position towards the admittance of refugees as the crisis developed (Holmes and Castañeda,
2016). During the refugee peak in 2015, Germany received more refugees than any other
country in Europe (Czymara, 2020; Heizmann and Ziller, 2020). The increase in asylum rates
was also accompanied by a sharp increase in anti-immigrant violence (Jäckle and König, 2017),
which led to political discussions over what to do with the growing number of refugees entering
Germany. This clash of the country’s moral heritage combined with modern-day antiimmigrant sentiment is reflected in its everyday discourse and contemporary policies, making
it ever more relevant to see how media deal with this issue.
Design
We employ a most similar cases design, comparing online and print versions of the same outlets
(but with independent editorials, see below). Since this design allows us to hold other outletspecific characteristics such as ideologies or political leanings constant, differences we find are
more likely caused by the online/print characteristic. However, one should keep in mind that
this leads to a conservative estimate of potential online/print differences.

We draw upon articles of the largest weekly news magazine in Germany, Der Spiegel,1
and the largest weekly newspaper, Die Zeit, as well as of Germany’s fourth largest daily
newspaper, Die Welt.2 While Die Welt is often considered more conservative, Die Zeit and Der
Spiegel are typically regarded center-liberal. In combination, they represent a relatively wide
spectrum of German quality news. Crucial for our study is that all three outlets maintain
websites with autonomous online editorial boards (Zeit Online and Spiegel Online) or an
autonomous online editorial board editor-in-chief (Welt Online).3 We, thus, assume that
workflows and practices are (sufficiently) autonomous from their print editorial, rendering
comparisons meaningful. Furthermore, all websites have many million visitors per month.4 Yet,
the outlets’ websites also publish selected articles from the respective print version, which we
address below. For a more specific description of the data, see Table A1 in Appendix A.
Data collection, preparation, and analysis5
We collected articles published between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017 from
LexisNexis, which included either terms related to refugees or asylum at least twice.6 This
results in an initial dataset of 32,597 articles. To remove articles that were published both online
and in print, we identified duplicates that were highly similar (at least 95% overlap), published
in the same year.7 To remove articles only loosely related to the migrant crisis or not all at, we
dropped those from sections that were evidently irrelevant, such as sports, cinema, or the US
election. Moreover, we calculated the ratio of the number of search term occurrences to article
length for each article and deleted those articles in the lowest ten percent of this score. We
reduced dimensionality by deleting stop words, terms occurring in more than a fifth or less than
0.1% of all articles8, and non-letter characters and stemmed terms, using Benoit et al. (2018).
This leaves us with a final dataset of 18,441 unique articles and 15,957 terms.9
We use the Structural Topic Modelling (STM) approach of R’s stm-package by Roberts
et al. (2014) to identify frames in our text data. STM is an unsupervised machine-learning
method that identifies dominant word clusters (our frames) in the data without a-priori
restrictions, relying on the bag-of-words assumption that each term in a text contributes to its
meaning independent of its position (Boumans and Trilling, 2016). Thus, we define a frame as
a cluster of words that represents a latent theme. STM determines how one set of frames is
distributed across the articles. Articles in our data most likely consist of various frames, some

Using unique articles makes the comparison cleaner but could also lead to a distortion of the results. We used
Gruber (2019) for the data import and for detecting duplicates. We always deleted the second occurrence of
articles. The 2,440 duplicates are significantly more common online (19% of online articles) than print (0.5% of
print articles). To ensure that selective deleting does not have an impact on our results, we re-estimated our models
without deleting any duplicates. Not only were we able to identify the same frames (see Table B5 in appendix B)
but also were the overall patterns in differences between print and online across frames largely the same (see
Figure B3 in appendix B).
8
Often or rarely used terms do not differentiate well between the different frames. Removing these terms enables
better identification of meaningful structures or frames in the text.
9
For each outlet, we calculated the share of relevant articles (precision score) based on a 3% random sample. We
defined articles as relevant if they relate to the immigration crisis, its causes, or consequences. These scores are
reasonably high, although not perfect for all cases, ranging from 0.76 to 0.91 (see Table 1). We have no reason to
assume that the noise in our data is systematic. Hence, it should have little influence on our results.

of them directly related to migration and refugees (for example, on asylum numbers) and others
not (for example, national elections). Topic modelling is especially suited for the analysis of
newspaper articles, where texts typically include several frames (Grimmer and Stewart, 2013,
p. 272). In an iterative process, STM yields a posterior probability distribution of the salience
(i.e., proportion or presence) of each frame per article, which is our main interest. The
probabilities of all frames to belong to an article sum up to one, meaning that frames are
interdependent. A crucial benefit of the STM package for our purpose is the possibility to
include covariates on the document level into the analysis (Roberts et al., 2014). We model
frame salience as a function of an online vs. print-dummy, the date of publication (as a nonlinear spline) as well as the interaction of both. Hence, we allow frame salience to generally
vary between online and print media, and also to follow different trends in online and print
media over time.
We opted for a model with 20 frames because we are interested in differences in broader
themes. From these 20 frames, we focus on 14 selected frames, as upon closer examination,
some of the found frames were applied to other issues discussed in the articles (the full set of
frames is shown in Table B2 in Appendix B).
Key events
Key events relate to important situations in Germany and abroad that are linked to refugees (see
Appendix A for the complete list). We use a dichotomous variable to distinguish the period up
to a week after a key event from other periods.
3 Results
Descriptive results
Figure 1 displays the total number of articles for all outlets. Reporting on the issue sharply
increased in fall 2015, which was when the number of arriving refugees increased and when
the issue became salient (see Czymara and Dochow, 2018). The number of monthly articles
increased by four from July to September 2015 (print: from about 100 to about 400; online:
from 200 to over 800). Another peak in January 2016 relates to the sexual assaults in Cologne
on New Year’s Eve, which many connected directly to the inflows of refugees (Frey 2020;
Czymara and Schmidt-Catran, 2017). By spring 2016, media attention on the issue declined
again, which suggests a normalization of the issue.
[FIGURE 1]
Although the issue was politicized, there were no major events that sparked an increase in media
attention until December 2016, right after the Islamist terror attack in Germany with the highest
number of casualties up to date (Fischer-Preßler, Schwemmer, and Fischbach, 2019; SchmidtCatran and Czymara, 2020). A final peak in September 2017 relates to the German
parliamentary elections, in which immigration and border policies were among the most
dominant topics. Although the article numbers were always higher for online news due to
structural reasons (two of three print outlets are released weekly), similar trends show in online
and print media.
Refugee and migration frames in German media

The relevant frames are presented in Table 1, which shows the terms with the highest
probability to be in each frame in descending order. Various frames relate to problems
associated with the intake of refugees: crime, terrorism, religious conflict, and fear.10 While
crime or security frames are usually identified in prior content analysis of media articles about
immigration (e. g., Greussing and Boomgaarden, 2017; Kluknavská, Bernhard, and
Boomgaarden, 2019; Kovář, 2019), we distinguish a terrorism frame from a frame more broadly
connected to crime. The terrorism frame primarily deals with particular attacks, most
prominently the assaults on New Year’s Eve 2015/16 in Cologne and the attack on a Christmas
market in Berlin in 2016. In contrast, the crime frame includes more general crime-related
issues such as injury, arson, or murder. The fear and the religious conflict frames capture
consequences and possible problems related to the refugee inflow on a more abstract level. Fear
captures emotional and negative terms such as problem, crisis, and danger, related mostly to
large social and political concepts such as society, democracy, or freedom. Among the articles
with the highest probability to belong to the fear frame are articles dealing with discomfort with
globalization and immigration, fatalism, or moral issues. Thus, fear can be regarded a
problematizing frame although it connects less to particular crimes or violence (Bennett et al.,
2013; Goodman and Speer, 2007; Horsti, 2007). Moreover, fear is the most dominant of our
main frames, being the primary frame of about eight percent of articles. This points to the
general uncertainty and “crisis character” in our analyzed media. The religious conflict frame
deals with ethnic and religious conflicts and resulting refugee flows from a more global
perspective, often with a particular emphasis on Muslims (see Czymara, 2019). Articles here
deal with situations in, for example, Jordan, Turkey, Pakistan, or Myanmar (e. g., “Poorer
countries take in most refugees”).
There is also a frame that deals with violence among the host society: the right-wing
extremism frame. This frame focuses on expressions of anti-immigrant protests and violence
and the far right. It relates most to the PEGIDA protests, which peaked at the beginning of 2015,
and attacks on refugee shelters in Saxony and other parts of Germany (Jäckle and König, 2017;
Frey 2020). This is distinct from the right-wing populism frame, which relates to party politics
and contains issues relating to Germany’s newly emerged right-wing populist party, the
Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
Other frames cover different stages of the flight process. The Middle East war frame
discusses some of the main causes of refugee flows: the war in Syria and the Islamic State (IS).
Route, refugee crossing, and border relate to flight and the entering of Europe. While route
deals with intra-EU issues such as the allocation of refugees among its member states, border
includes issues related to the outside border of Europe. The more specific Turkey frame relates
to the deal the European Union made with Turkey in order to lower the number of refugees that
flee over land through Turkey (BBC, 2016). Refugee crossing primarily deals with migrants
trying to enter Europe, for example, crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Many of the top articles
of this frame deal with the death of those migrants or their rescue. The accommodation frame
addresses one of the most urgent issues host societies must tackle after refugees have arrived:
the provision of accommodation. Similarly, the asylum frame deals with practical and
bureaucratic aspects which host societies face, including asylum procedures or deportation.
These frames are similar to the settlement and reception/distribution frames identified by
Greussing and Boomgaarden (2017) and the accommodation, refugee camps, border, or refugee
policies frames by Heidenreich et al. (2019).
In line with previous research, we also find an economy frame that addresses issues like
the integration of arriving refugees into the labor market (see Madra and Adaman, 2014;
Quinsaat, 2013).
10

Correlations between frames are shown in Table B1 in Appendix B.

[TABLE 1]
Frame occurrence in online and print media
We have argued that sensationalistic frames should be more visible online than in print (H1a).
Literature states that some frames have an inherent valence and, often implicitly, carry negative
aspects (De Vreese and Boomgaarden, 2003). The same holds for sensational elements, which
tend to converge with negative aspects within a single frame. Based on their content and top
terms, we distinguish fear, right-wing extremism, crime, terrorism, and Middle East war as
sensational. These are the frames most strongly connected to violence, safety, or threats to the
social status quo.
Figure 2 displays the differences in frame salience between online and print media.11 In
line with our theoretical expectations, right-wing extremism and crime frames are indeed
significantly more present online. However, there are, on average, no statistically significant
differences in occurrence of the terrorism and Middle East war frame. Contrary to our
theoretical reasoning, the fear frame even occurs significantly more in print. Taken together,
we find no systematic evidence in favor of Hypothesis 1a. Moreover, there are several
differences we would not expect. For example, economy is clearly more visible in print media
while route is more prominent online. These differences do not seem to follow a systematic
theoretical pattern and can hardly be explained ad hoc. Interestingly, differences between online
and print are more pronounced than differences across the three different outlets, as Figure B2
in Appendix B shows (see also Table B3). While this means that the differences between online
and print media seem to capture more important patterns compared to differences between the
three main outlets, these patterns are not in line with Hypothesis 1b.
[FIGURE 2]
Figure 3 shows time trends by plotting each frame’s salience as a smooth function of time,
distinguishing between online (black) and print (red) outlets. The different panels indicate how
salient each frame was at a specific point in time for both kinds of outlet, with the y-axes
showing the predicted probability for each frame to occur at a specific date. By and large, online
and print show similar temporal patterns of reporting. Yet, there are some notable new insights.
At the very beginning of the investigated period, which is before the major refugee intake but
during the then popular anti-immigration PEGIDA protests, we see a dominance of the rightwing extremism frame. With a predicted probability over 25% in early 2015, this dominance is
much stronger for online media than print, where this probability is below 15% (see fifth panel
of Figure 3). During the inflow in summer 2015, there were dozens of attacks on refugees and
asylum shelters, which are also captured by the right-wing extremism frame. These
developments were, again, considerably more present in online media, as the peak of the black
line in mid-2015 shows. From 2016 onwards, the salience of this frame converged for online
and print, and thereafter remained at a lower level for both.
As the number of those trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea began to rise in the
summer of 2015 (Eurostat, 2016), the focus of media reporting quickly shifted from the
extreme-right frame to the refugee crossing, and to the route frame somewhat later. Regarding
refugee crossing, online news peaks much stronger in the early summer of 2015. Yet as the
issue ‘normalizes’, the reporting on this frame converges and both outlets follow largely similar
trends after fall 2015. The route frame is more visible in online news, but only in the summer

As a robustness check, we also ran separate models that compare online and print within each outlet. The
conclusions are largely similar, which can be seen in Figure B1 in Appendix B.

of 2015 and spring 2016 (panel 3). The asylum frame gets considerable attention in 2017, which
holds true for online and print. Similar to the findings of Greussing and Boomgaarden (2017),
there is a rise in the crime frame, but this is again more the case for online media than for print.
In contrast, the terrorism frame rises mostly during the sexual assaults of New Year’s Eve
2015/16, and during the Berlin Christmas attack 2016. The peaks of terrorism occur similarly
in online and print media.
[FIGURE 3]
Although these time trends do not follow our expected pattern, there are distinct differences
between outlet types, and these differences sometimes change across time. This indicates that
eventual frame exposure of outlet-divided audiences can differ substantially, making some
aspects seem disproportionally more salient than others.
To see whether online and print frame usage follows the logic of key events, we ran a
set of regressions, modeling salience of each frame as a function of the online/print-dummy,
the event dummy, and an interaction of both (full results in Table B4 in Appendix B). Figure 4
shows differences between online and print media in times of key events (event dummy held at
1, based on the interaction column in Table B4). Results suggest that online and print media do
not differ more during key events (with the exception of the route frame).
[FIGURE 4]
Variability in media reporting in online and print
In order to test Hypotheses 2 and 3a/b, we generated a measure for the variety of frame usage
in online and print media. To this end, we first calculated the distance of a frame’s probability
from the overall probability for all frames in each article. Subsequently, we generated the
standard deviations of these distances for each frame. Finally, we compared the standard
deviations of online with print news averaged per week. We subtracted these scores from 1 so
that this measure captures whether the overall spread of frames in a week is more (values closer
to 0) or less (values closer to 1) equal. A higher score therefore indicates a more diverse range
of frames used within articles during a week.
Figure 5 shows that, while frame variability fluctuates over time, it is almost always
larger in print than in online media. This means print media exhibit a more diverse pattern,
whereas online media are slightly but consistently more dominated by particular frames.
Averaged over all weeks, this difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001), which is in line
with our second hypothesis, stating that print news shows more frame diversity.12
[FIGURE 5]
To test the impact of key events on the differences in the diversity of frame usage (H3a/b), we
first compare media coverage during key events (up to one week after) to periods outside of
key events. Reporting after important events does not significantly differ from other times in
terms of frame usage (p = 0.28), refuting H3a. In a final step, we tested whether the difference
in frame variability between online and print media is more pronounced during key events.
Similar to the results discussed above, frame usage is significantly larger for print than for
online news at times outside of key events (p < 0.001). However, this difference is not
significantly stronger during key events (p = 0.776). In sum, this indicates that key events
12

This difference remains statistically significant even when duplicates are not removed from the data (p < 0.001).

neither affect frame diversity in general, nor do such events trigger greater diversity in print (or
online) media, as hypothesized in H3b.
4 Conclusion
News media play a key role in providing and interpreting the information related to phenomena
that go beyond direct experiences, such as immigration. The impact of mass media on individual
ethnic prejudice has been discussed for decades (see, e. g., Allport, 1979, pp. 200 ff.) and has
more recently become a main subject in empirical-quantitative studies (Boomgaarden and
Vliegenthart, 2007; Czymara and Dochow, 2018; Van Klingeren et al., 2015). Since more
people have started to read online media on a daily basis, examining differences between
classical print versus online media is an important task to see what information people are
actually exposed to. We addressed this question based on one of the most prominent topics of
this decade: the so-called immigration crisis.
Returning to our first research question, which covered the appearance and
developments of the frames used during the crisis, we have shown that 14 of the 20 frames
underlying our model directly relate to the topic under consideration. These 14 partially
overlapped with frames found in previous studies on the recent refugee situation in Europe,
including the economy, crime, or terrorism frames (Greussing and Boomgaarden, 2017;
Heidenreich et al., 2019). More generally, these frames relate to the more classic victimization
and problematization frames (Bennet et al., 2013; Goodman and Speer, 2007; Horsti, 2007;
Van Gorp, 2005). In addition to what previous research had found, we distinguished the frames
right-wing extremism, right-wing populism, Middle East war, and accommodation, which were
less visible in earlier studies.
Comparing print and online media pointed to some differences, with fear, economy, and
accommodation being more visible in print, while route, turkey, and right-wing
extremism/populism were more visible in online news media. Our over time exploratory
analysis showed that these differences were not necessarily present at all time but often related
only to certain periods or, in some cases, developed at seemingly random times. This is an
important finding, given the fact that this is often neglected in studies that apply print newspaper
data as a proxy of news environments in general (Boomgarden and Vliegenthart, 2007;
Czymara and Dochow, 2018; van Klingeren et al., 2015). Furthermore, the perspectives of the
growing number of people solely consuming news online might diverge from those primarily
drawing upon print media. This indicates that people may not be stuck in filter bubbles in the
traditional sense but that frame bubbles may well exist depending on the type of outlet people
use.
Perspectives may also narrow, as we found a steady difference in the diversity of frame
usage between both types of outlets, with online media emphasizing particular frames more
than their print versions. Despite some of these systematic differences in frame visibility and
variability, we should note that both types of news outlets followed the same general trends in
frame usage across time. In other words, relative issue or frame saliences are likely to be rather
similar. Relating these findings to the terminology used by Karlsson and Strömbäck (2010)
(convergence, immediacy, and interactivity), we found that, despite online news being more
interactive and relying more on ‘click-bait’ captions and writing more in terms of ‘what sells’,
this did not mean that they applied more sensationalistic frames than print media.
5 Discussion
We investigated the reporting about immigration and refugees in German quality media during
the times of the so-called immigration crisis. Comparing the online and print versions of three

major outlets with distinct online output, we found several frames that were constantly
prominent and others that peaked at specific points in time. Differences between print outlets
and their online equivalents give us knowledge on whether inferring from one to the other is
eligible or not. However, since the analyzed period is in many respects outstanding, scholars
may examine whether our findings hold for other issues, more niche outlets, other countries, or
less turbulent times. Although there is no reason to assume that our findings are unique to the
immigration issue, only future research will be able to tell whether this is indeed the case.
While we can offer new and important insights for both communication and social
sciences, there are also limitations to our study. The first relates to the selection of what is
usually considered quality media. The online outlets we observe reach many million visitors
per month.13 However, this does not necessarily represent the news spectrum at large.
Moreover, our most similar cases design leads to differences that should be seen as the lower
boundaries of potential differences between online and print news. Examining more niche news
websites or blogs, which can still have considerable reach, is likely to yield larger differences.
In contrast to our design, however, such a comparison of ‘print apples and online oranges’
would make it harder to attribute potential differences merely on the characteristic ‘online’ or
‘print’.
Furthermore, we do not directly quantify the tone related to the different frames. Some
frames are arguably inherently more positive and empathetic, while others deal with undeniably
negative issues, such as inter-ethnic conflict or terrorism. However, it is by no means certain
that such frames are applied primarily positively or negatively. In fact, quality media are often
difficult to classify in this respect (Lawlor, 2015). Developing more sophisticated sentiment
analysis on these frames could be a promising endeavor for future research.
Despite our expectation, we did not observe that online articles were systematically
shorter due to convergence. Yet, our analysis indicates that online coverage is more focused in
terms of frame usage. Future research may further investigate the specific characteristics of
online news content and especially the way it is received by its audience.

Precision score
Note: Precision scores based on manual coding of a three percent random samples for each
outlet
Table A1 shows a clear imbalance between the outlets regarding the total number of published
articles as well as their article length. Articles in print media are, on average, significantly
longer compared to those released only online (average number of characters in print: 4366.21
vs. online: 3674.69). To be expected, the weekly print outlets (Der Spiegel and Die Zeit)
published the fewest number of articles throughout the period of investigation, ranging from
below 600 to above 700 articles in total (see Table 1). Moreover, the print version of Der Spiegel
has significantly shorter articles than the other two print outlets. Zeit Online released less than
half of Spiegel Online or Welt Online, but exhibits significantly longer articles than the other
two, being more comparable with its print version. Welt Online published most on the topic
with almost 5,500 articles.
