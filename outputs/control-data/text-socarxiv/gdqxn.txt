Christian Nationalism and White Racial Boundaries:
Examining Whites’ Opposition to Interracial Marriage

Abstract
How does the convergence of national and religious identities potentially fortify white racial
boundaries in the United States? Focusing on openness to racial exogamy as an indicator of
racial boundaries, we examine the link between Christian nationalism and white Americans’
views toward their hypothetical daughter marrying an African American, Latino, or Asian.
Drawing on theoretical insights from social identity complexity theory, we argue that the
convergence of religious and national identities serves to reinforce in-group boundaries, thereby
fortifying notions of white purity, and consequently, strengthening whites’ discomfort with
potential race-mixing in marriage. Multivariate analyses of national survey data demonstrate that
Christian nationalism is strongly associated with an increase in white Americans’ discomfort
with their daughter marrying any racial minority, and particularly African Americans. We
demonstrate how the convergence of religious and national identities in Christian nationalism
influences whites’ regulating of racial boundaries (evidenced in intermarriage attitudes) above
and beyond the independent effects of political conservatism or religious exclusivism.

Key words: Christian nationalism, interracial marriage, religion, racial boundaries, social

Introduction
Within the United States, the boundaries of whiteness have traditionally included a variety of
symbolic and behavioral dimensions that represent criteria for inclusion, both in the more
proximate (family, friends, neighbors) and distal (institutions, citizenship) sense. Beyond
perceived phenotypical differences, these symbolic criteria have included language, class,
gender, economic ideology, sexual orientation, and perhaps most prominently, national origins
and religion (Edgell and Tranby 2010; Gordon 1964; Lamont and Molnar 2000; Omi and Winant
1994). Historically, white Americans have been reluctant to relax the boundaries of whiteness
and extend in-group privileges to persons outside of the white-majority national (AngloEuropean) or religious (Protestant) heritage (Allport 1954; Bonilla-Silva 1999 Edgell et al. 2006;
Gordon 1964; Lee and Bean 2010). Although research has shown that white Americans who
identify as more politically-traditionalist are relatively more likely to maintain rigid racial
boundaries, as are whites who identify with more-exclusivist, sectarian religious groups (Edgell
and Tranby 2010; Emerson and Smith 2000; Lamont and Molnar 2000), little empirical work as
focused on the ways in which social identities that blur the lines between national and religious
group membership may also fortify white racial boundaries in the U.S. in ways that are above
and beyond the independent influences of political conservatism or religious exclusivism.
Following the election of George W. Bush in 2000 and culminating in the Tea Party
movement since 2009, scholars have called attention to what they consider to be a resurgence of
a conservative strain of national-religious identity or ‘Christian nationalism’ (Aho 2013;
Goldberg 2006; Gorski 2009, 2010; McDaniel et al. 2011), defined as a ‘blending of Christian
and patriotic narratives and iconography that blurs or erases the line between religious and
political community and identity’ (Gorski 2009, 91). Simply put, Christian nationalists envision

1

‘the boundaries of the religious and political communities to be as coterminous as possible’
(Gorski 2010, 7). Scholars point out that Christian nationalist ideology has historically had
highly racialized and imperialist underpinnings; and some theorize that a resurgence of Christian
nationalism in the public sphere will likely serve to buttress notions of white purity and systemic
non-white exclusion in American social life (Aho 2013; Barkun 1994; Goldberg 2006). Despite
its plausibility, little empirical research exists to substantiate this theory or to flesh out the
potential mechanisms at work in this relationship.
Focusing on white Americans’ openness to interracial marriage as a particularly salient
indicator of racial boundaries (Allport 1954; Childs 2005; Gordon 1964; Lee and Bean 2010;
Pascoe 2009; Qian and Lichter 2007) and drawing on theoretical insights from social identity
complexity theory (Roccas and Brewer 2002; Schmid et al. 2009), in this article, we analyze
national-level survey data to examine the extent to which Christian nationalism—representing a
convergence of national and religious identities—potentially fortifies whites’ unwillingness to
relax the boundaries of whiteness, as evidenced by their reported discomfort with a hypothetical
daughter marrying an African American, Asian, or Latino. The results from this research extend
our understanding of the intersections of social identities, persistent racial exclusion, and
contemporary national politics by highlighting a potential mechanism linking revitalized efforts
to ‘preserve’ or ‘recover’ America’s ‘Christian heritage’ on the Religious Right with covertlyracist intent, and ultimately contributing to the fortification of racial boundaries.
Background and Framework
National Religious Identity and White Supremacy in the United States
Gorski (2009, 2010) traces the development and ideological content of Christian
nationalism in the United States to two principal sources: ethno-nationalism and the Hebrew

2

Bible. Christian nationalists read Old Testament passages about the chosen-ness of the Israelites
and God’s demand for their blood-purity through sacrifice and through marital-endogamy not as
a metaphor of covenant, but more literally as requiring ethnic separation and the racial purity of
the chosen people. Despite the historically ethnicized content of Christian nationalism, Gorski
(2010) theorizes that, following the Holocaust and the Civil Rights movement, the explicitly
racialist versions of Christian nationalism were undermined and weakened.
Other writers, however, maintain that Christian nationalism, applied to contemporary
white America, implies the same desire for white racial purity and exclusivity though in a more
covert form. Aho (2013) and Goldberg (2006), for example, argue that Christian nationalist
ideals—e.g., support for policies expanding religion’s role in government, discouraging debt, and
enforcing biblical morality and work ethic—help constitute the belief structure undergirding
contemporary neoliberal ideology which staunchly opposes both welfare aid to poor minority
families and race-based affirmative action policies in education and employment. Aho (2013)
also demonstrates how contemporary Christian nationalists engage in a revisionist history of
race-relations in America’s past, expressing ambivalence about the slavery of African
Americans, and even emphasizing the ‘benefits’ that accrued to blacks because of their
enslavement (for example, see Barton 2011).
Scholars also draw a connection between contemporary Christian nationalism and
xenophobic and racist opposition to immigration. At the ideological level, because Christian
nationalists believe America’s ‘Christian heritage’ should be defended, they tend to oppose the
immigration of non-Christians (e.g., Muslims), who also tend to be non-white (Aho 2013).
Directly testing for a link between Christian nationalism and anti-immigration sentiment,
McDaniel et al. (2011) demonstrate that Christian nationalist ideology is a strong predictor of

3

antagonism toward immigrants, and that evangelical Protestantism only predicts anti-immigrant
views when Christian nationalism is not considered. The authors, however, do not specify how
the effect of Christian nationalism on public opinion toward immigrants was potentially
moderated by the ethnicity of the immigrant in question (e.g., Asian, Latino, African, etc.).
Moreover, because many non-white ethnic immigrants are non-Christian as well, it is difficult to
discern the extent to which this observed link between Christian nationalism and anti-immigrant
sentiments is due to ethnic prejudice or religious prejudice primarily. The current study resolves
these issues by focusing on whites’ openness toward intermarriage with African Americans,
Latinos, and Asians, as well as controlling for religious exclusivism in multivariate models.
White Opposition to Racial Endogamy as an Indicator of Racial Boundaries
Despite the prevalence of white/non-white sexuality in American history, notions of
white biological and cultural supremacy historically inclined whites to oppose race-mixing as a
threat to white racial purity and, ultimately, white dominance (Pascoe 2009). This fear of racemixing provoked whites to establish and enforce racial segregation in residence, work,
education, social and religious life, and most importantly in marriage relationships (Childs 2005;
Pascoe 2009; Root 2001; Rosenfeld 2007; Spickard 1989). In her landmark historical study of
anti-miscegenation law, Pascoe (2009, 6) argues, ‘Miscegenation law…was not just one of the
various forms of segregation practiced between 1880 and 1930 but the foundation for the larger
racial projects of white supremacy and white purity.’ Thus, race scholars have long argued that
greater approval of racial exogamy among whites ‘would symbolize the abolition of prejudice’
(Allport 1954, 377), serving as a leading indicator that racial boundaries were abating and whites
were granting full acceptance to minorities (Allport 1954; Gordon 1964; Lee and Bean 2010).
Additionally, whites’ openness to intermarriage with particular minority groups has also served

4

as an indicator of racial hierarchy between groups, with whites historically being more averse to
intermarriage with blacks, compared to Asians or Latinos (Author 2013a, 2013b; Herman and
Campbell 2012; Rosenfeld 2007; Spickard 1989). Building on this research, understanding what
social and ideological factors shape whites’ views toward interracial marriage with blacks,
Latinos, and Asians provides insight into what factors may contribute to the weakening, or,
conversely, the fortification of white racial boundaries, and whether these boundaries are closed
to certain groups more than others.
Previous research examining what factors tend to predict opposition toward racial
exogamy finds that whites who disapprove of interracial marriage tend to be older, male,
politically conservative, live in the American South, have racially homogenous backgrounds
(neighborhoods, workplaces, schools, congregations), racially intolerant families, lower incomes,
tend to be less educated, come from less educated families, are generally more religious (mostly
in terms of church attendance) and more theologically conservative (Author 2013a, 2013b, 2014;
Golebiowska 2007; Herman and Campbell 2012; Johnson and Jacobson 2005; Rosenfeld 2007;
Wilson and Jacobson 1995; Yancey 1999, 2001). In general, this research suggests that
interracial marriage tends to be opposed by whites who are more traditionalist in other areas.
This leads us to consider the role of religion—often an indicator of not only more traditionalist
identities and beliefs but also robust in-group cultural boundaries that may be extended and
projected onto national boundaries—on whites’ support for interracial marriage.
Christian Nationalism, Racial Boundaries, and Whites’ Views toward Racial Exogamy
Most studies that test religion’s influence on intermarriage attitudes find that whites who
are more religiously devout in terms of church attendance (Golebiowska 2007; Herman and
Campbell 2012; Johnson and Jacobson 2005; Yancey 1999, 2001), religious practice in general

5

(Herman and Campbell 2012; but see Author 2013a, 2014), or in depth of religious commitment
(Wilson and Jacobson 1995) tend to be less open to racial exogamy. Scholars have also reported
that white conservative Protestants or evangelicals are more likely to express disapproval of
(often black-white) interracial marriage, relative to Mainline Protestants, Catholics, or the
religiously unaffiliated (Putnam and Campbell 2010; Spickard 1989; Wilson and Jacobson
1995). More recently, the author (2014) reported that whites who express a greater desire to pass
on religious heritage are less likely to support the idea of their daughters marrying interracially
with any minority groups. This finding suggests that, for white Americans, religious identity has
an ethnic component in that whites who desire their descendants to carry their religious heritage
implicitly expect that those descendants will be white. This finding also suggests that other
aspects of religious identity may influence whites’ support of racial exogamy.
While no studies have explicitly sought to link Christian nationalism with white
opposition to racial exogamy, several authors theorize that such a connection likely exists. In her
study of Christian nationalism, Goldberg (2006) cites research indicating that almost fifty
percent of white conservative Christians would disapprove of their child marrying a black
person, compared to about 22 percent of white Americans in general. Yancey (2007) found that
white American online daters who were both frequent churchgoers and politically conservative
(which he suggests may be a proxy for the Religious Right) were less willing to date non-whites.
Yancey theorizes that the particular conservative religious ideology of the Religious Right may
support notions of racial purity in romantic and family relationships. Lastly, examining the
criteria for cultural membership among Americans, Edgell and Tranby (2011) found that
‘cultural preservationists,’ those who seek to defend America’s unified, white Christian culture,
are more likely than either ‘optimistic pluralists’ or ‘critics of multiculturalism’ to disapprove if

6

their child wanted to marry ‘someone different from him/herself’ (measured on a scale across
eight different categories).
Based on these findings and contemporary theories linking Christian nationalism with the
fortification of white racial boundaries, we predict that as support for Christian nationalism
increases, white Americans will be less comfortable with the idea of their children marrying
interracially. The theoretical concept of social identity complexity allows us to further highlight
the mechanisms at work in the relationship between Christian nationalism and racial boundaries.
Christian Nationalism and Social Identity Complexity Theory
Social identity complexity (SIC) refers to individuals’ subjective representation of the
interrelationships among their multiple group identities (Roccas and Brewer 2002). Individuals
with high SIC see their in-groups as mostly distinct with cross-cutting memberships. Those with
low SIC perceive their in-groups as mostly overlapping and convergent (Brewer and Pierce
2005). As Roccas and Brewer (2002, 95) point out, even if an individual objectively knows that
their in-groups do not share a high overlapping membership (not all Americans are Christians),
she can ‘still subjectively represent her identities as highly overlapping’ (my type of Americans
are Christians). In instances of high perceived overlap in group memberships the different ingroups actually come to be conceived of as a single convergent social identity (Brewer,
Gonsalkorale, and van Dommelen 2013; Brewer and Pierce 2005). Christian nationalists are one
example of a single convergent social identity arising out of the perception of a high degree of
overlap between three identities, in this case, Christian, American, and (for most Christian
nationalists) white.
When individuals perceive a large degree of overlap between their group memberships,
they are more likely to exaggerate the homogeneity of the group and to erect strict group

7

boundaries delineating between those in the group from those outside (Roccas and Brewer 2002).
Furthermore, low SIC individuals are more likely to perceive threats to their in-group and their
single convergent social identity because it is in many cases their most important social identity
(McDaniel et al. 2011; Roccas and Brewer 2002; Schmid et al. 2009). A number of studies
demonstrate that variation in SIC is associated with attitudes toward out-groups (Brewer and
Pierce 2005; Roccas and Brewer 2002; Schmid et al. 2009). Regarding attitudes toward different
racial/ethnic categories, individuals with low SIC tend to be more intolerant of racial/ethnic outgroups while individuals with higher SIC tend to be more accepting (Brewer et al. 2013; Brewer
and Pierce 2005; Miller, Brewer, and Arbuckle 2009).
Because Christian nationalists maintain a single convergent social identity marked by low
SIC which is accompanied by a perception that an out-group member on one dimension (e.g.,
racial identity) is an out-group member on all other dimensions (e.g., religious and national
identity), they will be much more likely to maintain strict boundaries between their in-group
(Christian, American, predominantly-white) and racial out-groups (McDaniel et al. 2011). In
other words, the low SIC of white Christian nationalists would incline them to strongly favor, not
only government policies and practices that reinforce their shared religio-national identity of
‘Christian-Americans,’ but also salient racial boundaries in social relationships that buttress
notions of white racial purity.
Based on these insights from empirical work on Christian nationalism, whites’ views
toward interracial marriage, and SIC theory, we expect that, net of other effects, white
Americans who more strongly adhere to Christian nationalism will be less comfortable with their
children marrying an African American, Latino, or Asian. Additionally, building on previous
research finding that white Americans tend to be more opposed to interracial marriage with

8

African Americans compared to Latinos or Asians, we expect that: Christian nationalism’s
influence on the strengthening of white racial boundaries will be more pronounced regarding
African Americans, being perceived as a more distinct and stigmatized out-group for white
Americans, relative to Latinos and Asians.
Data and Method
We test the above hypothesis using data from wave 2 of the Baylor Religion Survey
(BRS), which was fielded in 2007. The BRS was designed with a goal to comprehensively assess
the religious attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of American adults. Although the majority of BRS
measures inquire about respondents’ religious lives, the 2007 BRS also included a module
containing dozens of questions inquiring about the racial composition of respondents’
workplaces, neighborhoods, friendship networks, and congregations; their attitudes toward
interracial marital relationships; and whether they personally had ever engaged in interracial
dating or romance. This combination of question tapping respondents’ religio-political views and
views toward racial issues is unavailable in any other survey.
Survey data were collected by the Gallup Organization, with a final N of 1,648 cases. The
BRS was drawn from a national random sample of U.S. adults with telephones obtained through
random digit dialing. In total, 3,500 potential respondents were contacted and asked if they
would be willing to complete a mailed questionnaire. One thousand of these 3,500 were also
given a brief phone interview to check for systematic bias in the types of people who refused to
participate. A total of 2,460 questionnaires were mailed out to those who agreed to participate,
with 1,648 questionnaires returned for a response rate of 47.1 percent (1,648/3,500).
Demographic results from wave 2 of the BRS compare favorably to demographic results from
other national surveys like the General Social Survey. To correct for missing data, we utilized a

9

multiple imputation (MI) procedure (Rubin 1996). All results use the MI dataset. For a detailed
description of data collection and sampling procedures, see Bader, Mencken, and Froese (2007).
Opposition to Interracial Marriage
The dependent variable for this study is whites’ reported level of discomfort with a
hypothetical daughter marrying someone from a specific minority group. The BRS asked
respondents, ‘How comfortable would you be if a daughter of yours married someone who is
[black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian]?’ The framing of this question is an
improvement over survey questions that ask white respondents about whether they personally
would consider marrying someone of another race, since some respondents might explain that
they simply are not attracted to blacks, Latinos, or Asians, and thus, their unwillingness to outmarry may not be due to overt racial prejudice. Asking respondents how they would feel about
their daughter out-marrying is a better way to gauge whether they would disapprove of the union
due to prejudicial attitudes about other racial groups. Possible responses to this question include:
(1) ‘not at all comfortable,’ (2) ‘somewhat comfortable,’ and (3) ‘very comfortable.’ For our
analyses, we dichotomized this measure into 1 = ‘not at all comfortable’ and 0 = ‘somewhat/very
comfortable.’1 Respondents with a 1 for this measure are therefore understood to unequivocally
disapprove of interracial marriage to a member of the specified minority group.2
Christian Nationalism Measures
Our focal independent variable is white respondents’ adherence to Christian nationalism.
To measure this concept, we construct an index utilizing six level-of-agreement statements,
which were as follows. (Christian Nation) ‘The federal government should declare the United
1

Initial analyses indicated that the three-value coding of the dependent variable violated the proportional odds
assumption and thus we were unable to use ordinal regression.

Regression analyses were also run with 1 = ‘very comfortable’ and 0 = ‘somewhat/not at all comfortable,’ and
results were substantively the same (available upon request).

10

States a Christian Nation.’ (Christian Values) ‘The federal government should advocate
Christian values.’ (Religious Symbols) ‘The federal government should allow the display of
religious symbols in public spaces.’ (School Prayer) ‘The federal government should allow
prayer in public schools.’ (God’s Plan) ‘The success of the United States is part of God’s plan.’
And (Church/State) ‘The federal government should enforce a strict separation of church and
state’ (reverse-coded). Responses ranged from (1) Strongly Disagree to (5) Strongly Agree. The
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for these measures was .89 indicating high reliability.
Prior research utilizing social identity complexity operationalized the concept by asking
respondents to identify various groups of which they consider themselves a part (Brewer et al.
2009; Brewer and Pierce 2005; Miller et al. 2009; Roccas and Brewer 2002; Schmid et al. 2009).
McDaniel and colleagues (2011) extended this work to measure Christian nationalism as a social
identity by constructing an index using responses from six statements similar to those found in
the 2007 BRS. We construct this measure of Christian nationalism and social identity complexity
by following McDaniel et al.’s (2011) work in this analysis. We also understand that this
measure does not assess the totality of someone’s social identity and that is not our goal. Rather,
we aim to discover if one aspect of their identity, be it more or less complex, can influence their
views on an important social issue like race.
Controls
Multivariate analyses include a host of socio-demographic controls. Age is measured in
years from 18 to 96. We include dummy variables for gender (female = 1), marital status
(married = 1), children (any children = 1), and region (South = 0, East = 1, West = 1, Midwest =
1). Education is measured in attainment categories from (1) 8th grade or less to (7) postgraduate
work/degree. Political ideology is measured from (1) extremely liberal to (7) extremely

11

conservative. To control for religious factors, the analyses include measures for religious
tradition, beliefs about the Bible, religious practice, and the respondents’ desire for their child to
marry within their religion. Religious tradition is measured with seven broad categories
following Steensland et al. (2000): evangelical, mainline Protestant, Catholic, Black Protestant,
Jewish, Other, and Unaffiliated. Evangelicals serve as the reference category. We also control for
whether respondents are biblical literalists (biblical literalism = 1, all other views of the Bible =
0). In order to gauge various dimensions of religious behavior, we constructed a religious
practice scale using three BRS questions concerning respondents’ frequency of religious service
attendance, sacred text reading, and prayer. For frequency of religious service attendance and
sacred text reading, respondents could indicate (1) never to (9) several times a week. For prayer
frequency, respondents chose options from (1) never to (6) several times a day. These measures
were standardized into Z scores and summed in order to create the religious practice scale (α =
.83). Lastly, the BRS asks respondents how important it is to them that their hypothetical child
marries someone who shares the parent’s religion. We include this measure to control for
respondents’ desire for religious endogamy (unimportant = 1, important = 0). Lastly, multivariate
analyses controlled for whether respondents had close friends who were [black, Latino, or
Asian]. Respondents who did not have any [black, Latino, or Asian] friends are coded 1.
[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
Findings
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables in multivariate models. Consistent
with previous research, for white Americans, the prospect of intermarriage with African
Americans seems to be somewhat more discomfiting than marriage to Latinos or Asians. While
only 20 percent of whites are ‘not at all comfortable’ with their hypothetical daughters marrying

12

a Latino or Asian person, almost 30 percent of whites are ‘not at all comfortable’ regarding
marriage to an African American.
Table 2 presents odds ratios from binary logistic regression models predicting whites’
disapproval of their hypothetical daughter marrying an African American. Model 1 includes only
the Christian nationalism measure without controls. The effect is statistically significant and the
odds ratio (OR = 1.09; p < .001) indicates that for every unit increase in the Christian
nationalism scale (24 units), the likelihood that a white adult feels ‘not at all comfortable’ with
her/his daughter marrying an African American increases by 9 percent. Model 2 includes the
controls for religious tradition, biblical literalism, religious practice, and the respondent’s desire
for religious endogamy. The effect of Christian nationalism remains unchanged by the inclusion
of the religion controls. For religious tradition, only those in “other” traditions differ
significantly from evangelicals in their comfort with interracial marriage to blacks, but this effect
washes out in other models. Biblical literalism is nonsignificant in its effect. Interestingly,
religious practice is significantly and negatively associated with opposition to interracial
marriage. Whites who more frequently attend worship service, pray, and read their sacred texts
are actually less likely to express discomfort with interracial marriage. But paradoxically, whites
who do not consider it important for their children to marry within their religion are also less
likely to disapprove of interracial marriage. The robust nature of Christian nationalism’s effect
on whites’ views toward interracial marriage in the face of these religious controls suggests that
the observed effect of Christian nationalism is likely not due to theological conservatism,
traditionalist affiliations, high religiosity, or whites’ desire for religious endogamy.
Model 3 includes standard socio-demographic controls. Age and political conservatism
are positively related to whites’ discomfort with interracial marriage to African Americans, while

13

being from the Eastern, Midwest, or Western United States (vs. being in the South) are
negatively related to whites’ disapproval of interracial marriage. With the inclusion of the sociodemographic controls, Christian nationalism, along with the other religion measures, has
changed in relative size of its effect. Whereas Christian nationalism was the strongest effect in
Model 2, the inclusion of the socio-demographic controls has dropped the substantive effect of
Christian nationalism (β = .21) to third, behind age (β = .22) and political conservatism (β = .26).
Model 4 represents the full model and includes the measure for whether the respondent did not
have any close black friends, which is also a strong predictor of whites’ discomfort with
interracial marriage. In the full model, the effect Christian nationalism on whites’ intermarriage
views is still significant beyond the .001 level and remains the third strongest predictor behind
only age and political conservatism.
Tables 3 and 4 present the odds ratios from logistic regression models predicting whites’
discomfort with their hypothetical daughter marrying a Latino or an Asian, respectively. The
results from these analyses are largely the same as those in Table 2, but the effect of Christian
nationalism is slightly weaker in both statistical and substantive significance. In the full models,
Christian nationalism remains a significant predictor of whites’ discomfort with intermarriage to
Latinos or Asians, but now at the .05 level. And Christian nationalism is the fifth strongest
predictor of whites’ disapproval of interracial marriage to Latinos or Asians behind friendship
with Latinos or Asians, political ideology, and living in the Midwest or West (versus the South).
In sum, these analyses demonstrate that white Americans who more strongly adhere to
Christian nationalism tend to express greater discomfort with the idea of their daughter marrying
anyone who is non-white, and especially African Americans. Thus, as social identity complexity

14

decreases, the tendency toward intolerance of perceived out-groups increases. These findings
strongly support our expectation.
[TABLES 2 THROUGH 4 ABOUT HERE]
Figure 1 presents predicted probabilities in order to illustrate the relationship between
whites’ discomfort with intermarriage to African Americans, Asians, and Latinos, across levels
of support for Christian nationalism. As support for Christian nationalism increases, there is a
steady increase in whites’ discomfort with interracial marriage to all minority groups considered,
and this increase is particularly sharp regarding African Americans. At the lowest levels of
Christian nationalism, only about 10 percent of whites are ‘not at all comfortable’ with
intermarriage to Asians or Latinos, and this rises to 25 percent of whites at the highest levels of
Christian nationalism. By contrast, about 18 percent of whites are ‘not at all comfortable with
their daughters marrying an African American at the lowest levels of Christian nationalism, and
this percentage vaults to almost 50 percent at the highest levels of Christian nationalism. The
pattern observed in Figure 1 illustrates the general point that as social identity complexity
decreases, in-groups bias is fortified and intolerance of out-groups increases. However, it is also
clear that levels of intolerance directed toward out-groups varies by how the in-group perceives
particular out-groups relative to others. This helps explain why Christian nationalism is both
linked with opposition to marrying non-whites in general (because it fortifies notions of white
purity and exclusivity), while being more strongly associated with opposition to marrying
African Americans (who are seen as a more extreme and stigmatized out-group than Asians or
Latinos).
[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
Discussion and Conclusions

15

What relevance does the convergence of national and religious identities have for the
fortification of white racial boundaries in the United States? Guided by insights from social
identity complexity theory, we argue that because of the complex and interconnected nature of
social identities, the salience of certain identities (e.g., religion, national identity) may potentially
diminish the willingness of group members to expand or relax in-group boundaries and for group
members to consider racial out-groups as potential intimates, romantic partners, or family
members. Using whites’ views toward racial exogamy as an indicator of white racial boundaries,
we anticipated that greater adherence to Christian nationalism would be associated with greater
disapproval toward interracial marriage. Consistent with our expectations, our analyses affirm
that greater adherence to Christian nationalism, signifying lower levels of social identity
complexity, is strongly associated with whites’ discomfort at the thought of their daughter
marrying non-whites, and especially African Americans. This relationship exists even in the face
of a variety of relevant religious, ideological and socio-demographic controls. Thus, our findings
suggest that, for many white Americans, the idealized image of a Christian nation implies a
nation where racial boundaries are fortified and white racial heritage is protected.
Before we further discuss the implications of this study, several limitations should be
acknowledged. First, although white Americans’ views toward interracial marriage represent a
highly salient indicator of diminished social distance and whites’ willingness to relax racial
boundaries, it is admittedly only one indicator. Future research on this topic could employ other
measures of white racial boundary-keeping (e.g., McDaniel et al. 2011), such as whites’ views
toward and participation in racially-diverse volunteer organizations, including places of worship,
political action groups, and community-service associations, in which whites share ideological
views and time with non-whites, developing solidarity and potentially transcending racial

16

boundaries (see Marti, 2009). Second, although a number of recent studies have employed
quantitative data to understand the delineation and defense of white racial boundaries (e.g.,
Edgell et al. 2006; Edgell and Tranby 2010; Hartmann et al. 2011), boundary-work is often
profitably studied with qualitative data, such as in-depth interviews or ethnography (e.g.,
Emerson and Smith 2000; Lamont and Molnar 2000). More comprehensive assessments of the
role of convergent social identities, and particularly white Christian nationalism, and their
relationship with ethno-racial boundaries would ideally incorporate qualitative interviews to
flesh out the mechanisms at play.
These limitations notwithstanding, our study extends the literature on religious
nationalism in the United States, interracial romantic and family relationships, and social identity
complexity theory. Fundamentally, our findings demonstrate a clear and near-linear association
between adherence to Christian nationalism and whites’ disapproval of white/non-white racial
exogamy, even after controlling for political ideology, whites’ desire for religious heritage, their
friendships with non-white racial groups, and other socio-demographic factors. This central
finding strongly suggests that movements on the Religious Right to protect or restore America’s
so-called Christian heritage are likely not devoid of racial content. The vast majority of Christian
nationalists are white, and likely envision America’s religious heritage through an AngloEuropean, Protestant lens (Edgell and Tranby 2010). Consequently, taken together with
McDaniel et al. (2011) who found a strong link between Christian nationalism and whites’ antiimmigrant sentiment, our study demonstrates that Christian nationalism contains a distinct ethnoracial component and suggest that white Christian nationalists’ reported desire to either ‘protect’
or ‘restore’ America’s ‘Christian heritage’ is laced with an implicit desire to maintain white
supremacy and white racial purity (Aho 2013; Edgell and Tranby 2010; Goldberg 2006).

17

Importantly, our results clarify that Christian nationalists are not merely politically
conservative or desirous of religious exclusivity. If they were, controls for conservative political
ideology and desire for religious endogamy in the multivariate models would render the
Christian nationalism measure non-significant. Rather, Christian nationalism influences white
Americans’ defense of racial boundaries, and in this case their discomfort with interracial
marriage, above and beyond the effects of political conservatism and religious exclusivity
separately. Figure 2 illustrates this relationship. Figure 2A displays the effects of Christian
nationalism on the predicted probabilities of discomfort with one’s daughter marrying an African
American across different political ideologies. Regardless of political ideology, Christian
nationalists are more likely to express disapproval toward interracial marriage. So too, Figure 2B
shows the relationship between Christian nationalism and the predicted probabilities of
discomfort with marrying an African American by whether the respondent considers it important
for their children to marry within their faith or not. Here again Christian nationalists are more
likely to oppose racial endogamy regardless of their desire for religious endogamy.
[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Our analyses also provide further support for the utility of the theoretical construct of
social identity complexity. Extending prior research on SIC and attitudes toward immigrant outgroups, our findings show that varying levels of SIC dramatically influence views of more
intimate relationships like interracial marriage (see Figures 1 and 2). This study also highlights
the methodological flexibility of social identity complexity. The majority of prior SIC research
relied on convenience samples of college students or respondents living near the researchers. The
current analysis demonstrates that measures of SIC can be created using national, random data
and usefully applied in the analysis of broad attitudes (see McDaniel et al. 2011). As SIC

18

predicts, individuals who tend towards a single convergent social identity like Christian
nationalism are much more likely to erect strict boundaries between in-groups and out-groups.
The interconnectedness of racial, national, and religious identities for many white Americans
serves to fortify in-group boundaries and ultimately limit their openness to intimate cross-race
relations like interracial marriage. Future research, particularly quantitative studies using large,
national datasets, should continue to utilize social identity complexity to examine how individual
perceptions of collective identities shape racial attitudes.
In conclusion, some researchers question a link between intolerance and beliefs about the
‘Christian’ heritage of the United States. In Christian America? (2000), Smith points out that
while many evangelicals maintain beliefs about a Christian America, very few actually oppose
pluralism. He posits that adherence to a belief that the U.S. is a Christian nation is, basically, an
effort to maintain a collective identity. Therefore, it has little to do with intolerance or rejecting
pluralism in its various forms (Merino 2010). Our findings contradict this interpretation,
however. For white Americans, Christian nationalism is strongly associated with racial
intolerance. While Christian nationalist beliefs may provide a collective identity, social identity
complexity theory highlights how it is through such single, convergent, collective identities that
intolerance is propagated. It is important for future research to continue to examine Christian
nationalism and document when and how it is associated with various other forms of intolerance.
