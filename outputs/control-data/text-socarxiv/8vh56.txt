"10" "Abstract"
"11" "Introduction :  The teaching of bioethical stances  are often taught  amorphously despite there being a fair level of consensus within social groups.   METHOD:  A grid comparing  bioethic  stances for the major world religions  was created  ( https://goo.gl/ZpwJL7 ).  The consensus, or lack thereof, within each religious group is displayed in the grid as a  color coded  heatmap.  An online quiz ( http://bit.ly/2017ethics1 ) was also created  and tested as an educational resource by administered the quiz twice to four years of medical students at Marian University.  The open access online quiz  resource emails users personalized results comparing their last score to their prior attempts, against other quiz takers at their institution, and against an average of all quiz takers across institutions.   RESULTS:  User demographics  were analyzed  and their knowledge of religions bioethical stances was determined to not be affected by age or sex, but was found to improve as they progressed through medical school.  There was greater variance between ethical questions than there was between quiz takers for each ethical issue, highlighting specific biomedical ethical issues that may benefit from increased educational time in curricula.  There also appeared to be differences based on the quiz takers religious background but the sample size for most backgrounds was too small to extrapolate the results to a wider population.   DISCUSSION :  This bioethics quiz provides a resource to help educate those in the medical community, and will continue to generate data as it  is used  moving forward elucidating which populations should be targeted for increased educational intervention."
"12" "Introduction"
"13" "Physicians  are trained  to convey risks and options to their patients while always obtaining informed consent from the patient.  When patients are incapacitated (e.g. comma, mentally  handicapped) doctors can act on the “doctrine of necessity” providing care that is in the best interest of the patient (Kitzinger & Kitzinger 2015) .  Doctors have been shown to overestimate their ability to communicate risk vs benefit with patients (Ha &  Longnecker  2010) , and barriers to communication have been investigated (e.g. sedation, comprehension, relationship to patient, time constraints) ( Hyams  et al. 2018) .  An interest in training programs and creating standards of care have existed for over 40 years ( Waitzkin  1984) , however the implementation of such standards have been neither ubiquitous nor consistent.  In some settings over half of managed problems are handled prior to pharmaceutical or surgical intervention, most frequently in consultations as advice and counselling ( Warnecke  2014) .  More accurate estimates of patient understanding can be obtained when more time is devoted to gathering multiple versions of their thought process, such as through a  Rasch  model (Burro et al. 2018) , but time-constraints often make this unrealistic.  Social differences have been highlighted as one reason for the large gap in understanding between physician and patient ( Verlinde  et al. 2012) ."
"14" "As social inequalities widen and people become more immersed in a local and digital bubble it becomes increasingly important to educate physicians about other worldviews.  Not only has bioethics typically had less time reserved for its teaching in medical school, but it has also lagged behind other fields of study in that it is often still taught from a classical ancient  greek  perspective rather than through the use of clinical vignettes.  Thus  a student's competency is often judged based on outdated theoretical ideas.  This project codified the view of common bioethical issues discretely (positive of negative) in a grid, with an online quiz, and the results analyzed."
"15" "Methods"
"16" "All content  was developed  online to allow for the interconnection of results and accessibility.  The two main components used for this project were a google sheet “bioethics grid” that was populated with the common beliefs for 9 biomedical related concepts/issues in 9 religions as well as the common western secular view (Table-1 and  https://goo.gl/ZpwJL7 ), and a google form “quiz” ( http://bit.ly/2017ethics1 ) allowing for testing of knowledge from the bioethics grid.  The biomedical issues investigated were if the major world religions believe in/support:"
"17" "The age of the universe being over 10 billion years old"
"18" "Evolution"
"19" "Blood transfusion"
"20" "Gene therapy for humans"
"21" "Vasectomies and tubal ligations"
"22" "Contraception"
"23" "Morning after pill"
"24" "Early term abortions"
"25" "Late term abortions"
"26" "Analysis of religious stances were searched to fill out the grid and  in all  cases  a hyperlink to the source is provided in the bioethics grid.  Upon completion of the bioethics grid, it  was sent  to religious scholars or leaders (e.g. imams, priests) which we asked to verify the data. The only point at which our data gathering disagreed with some religious figures was on the topic of sterilization such as vasectomies.  Religious figures differed in their view of how permanent the procedures are.  Sterilization and tubal ligation are technically not permanent  procedures,  one can usually have them reversed, provided they have the means to pay for such a procedure."
"27" "There is of course significant heterogeneity of beliefs within each religious group.  A rubric was therefore formed (Supplemental Table-2) which allowed scaling for how ubiquitous a stance each organized religion had for the various biomedical issues. If an organized religion seemed 100% in support of a bioethical question (row in our bioethics  grid)  it was assigned a value of 1.0, whereas a stance unanimously against the issue receive a -1.0.  The intermediate affirmations of the bioethical issue went from  1 , to 0.75, to 0.5, to 0.25 with the most important aspect being the religious organizations stance followed by if the bioethics issue was legally allowed or taught in school by the countries with the largest populations of that religion in the world (Supplemental Table-2).  A similar metric  was done  in the negative direction.  Zeros were assigned when there did not seem to be a clear preference in either direction concerning the bioethical issue for that religion.  These values were then converted to just a Y/N (yes or no) but  color coded  by value to create a heat map (deep green =1, deep red = -1).  This tabular heatmap view is available as a teaching  tool  at   https://goo.gl/ZpwJL7  ."
"28" "Google forms  were then created  which we used as an online quiz to test individual’s knowledge of different religions stance on the aforementioned ethical issues.  One form was just a quiz filling in the grid with “yes” or “no” for each box, without displaying the correct answers at the end.  The other google form quizzed people on a blank grid but then showed them the answers at the end.   In March 2018 s tudents from Marian University College of Osteopathic Medicine were offered the option of taking this online quiz and without their knowledge were randomly assigned (50/50) to either a control group that got the quiz without answers afterwards, or to the intervention group which took a bioethics grid quiz which showed them answers afterwards.   After one  month  both groups were then sent the quiz to take again, all of which saw the answers afterwards.  Submitted quiz answers with less than five bioethical - religion boxes selected were removed from analysis to weed out people that clicked through as quickly as they could to see the answer or their  peers  results.  This resulted in 44 quiz takers that saw the answers after the first attempt and 32 quiz takers in the control group that did not.  In the second  round  21 students chose to take the quiz again (12 and 9 students from the intervention and control group respectively)."
"29" "A script  was written  in the google sheet, so upon taking the google form quiz an email is  automatically  sent to the quiz taker with the following information:"
"30" "Percent correct on first attempt"
"31" "Percent correct on last attempt"
"32" "Number of times they have taken the quiz"
"33" "Average first and last score for all quiz takers at their institution/business (based on email domain)"
"34" "Average first and last score for all quiz takers"
"35" "The percent correct on the first try was investigated  by religion born into, current religion,  year  in medical school, gender, and age using ANOVA.  The utility of seeing the answer grid  was also investigated  between the two groups using ANOVA.  The percent correct between different bioethical questions  was investigated  using t-tests.  All calculations were done assuming equal variance, with α=0.05, using the Julia programming language with the  ANOVA.jl  v0.1.0 plugin (downloadable from  github  at https://github.com/marcpabst/ANOVA.jl)."
"36" "Results"
"37" "Initially an attempt was made to fill in the grid using just the authoritative texts for the world religions (e.g. old testament, new testament,  koran ) to make the conclusions less  debateable .   However  it was quickly apparent that the religious texts were interpreted too widely for a discrete answer to be  undebately  referenced from them.   For example, the question regarding the age of the universe (relevant due to beliefs in the speed of evolution, antibacterial resistance, etc.) is explicitly stated as thousands of years in the bible, but most religious experts we consulted interpreted the biblical year as a different time unit than a calendar year, allowing for the belief in the universe being billions of calendar years old.   In such  cases  we turned to academic or authoritative analysis of these texts.  A reference column containing the secular view (scientific community norms)  was codified  as positive/believing in all of the bioethical issues.  Only two religions averaged below a zero (against or not believing in a majority of the biomedical issues): Christian (Catholic) at -0.14 and Jehovah's Witness at -0.03, although Muslim (Sikh) was almost zero at 0.03 (Table-1)."
"38" "Seven of the nine biomedical issues quizzed involve the implementation of discrete procedures, with the two questions about the age of the universe and belief in the evolutionary mechanism being somewhat different.  These later two were included because the ramifications of the duration life has been on earth and the speed with which it changes has many biomedical ramifications.  For example, certain antibiotics (e.g.  chloramphenicol)  effect humans more because they also inhibit human mitochondria, which were bacteria that  were engulfed  by eukaryotes over a billion years ago and are now hosted symbiotically.   Chloramphenicol is therefore not recommended after bone marrow transplants as it inhibits human protein  synthesis (McKee et al. 2006) .  Another example is the continued use of  antibiotics which  can drive antibiotic strains within one host’s (humans) lifetime.  Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients are instructed to maintain a  five foot  buffer from others with CF, since they are predisposed to harbor recurrent infections which can then  reinfect  each other."
"39" "Those that saw the quiz answers performed better on the second quiz than those that did not (65% vs 60%), however this sample size was small (n=21) and difference was not found to be statistically significant by ANOVA (p=0.097).  In addition, both the intervention answer seeing and control groups did better on the first quiz, 66% and 64% respectively.  These quizzes were optional and ungraded.  After all quizzes had been taken, unofficial discussion with some quiz takers revealed many students clicked through the second quiz very quickly to see the answers and how they performed compared to peers.  There was not a significant difference seen in result by age, though almost all the quiz takers were between 20 and 30 years of age.  Women performed better than  men  on their first attempt (67% vs 63% respectively), which approached significance (p = 0.065)."
"40" "ANOVA calculations showed the year in medical school to be statistically significant (p = 0.022),  while  religion  born into, current religion, gender, and age were not (p = 0.41, 0.30, 0.60, 0.12).  The percent correct by biomedical issue varied widely (~40% to 90% correct), with the difference in low and high performing ethical questions found to be significant (Supplemental Table- 4 , t-tests).   The bioethical issues people knew the most about were blood transfusions and later term abortions ( Figure-1 ).  This was not surprising given the greater agreement among religious backgrounds against late term abortions.  In addition, the objection that Jehovah’s  Witnesses have to blood transfusions is likely the most ubiquitously taught religious biomedical concern in medical school.  The bioethical  issues which had the largest percent correct variance  were the legitimacy of condom use and genetic engineering, while the least variance was seen regarding sterilization and  preimplantaion  abortions ( Figure-1 ).  Those with a Jewish background performed the worst on the  bioethics world religion quiz , while those from a Sunni Islamic background performed the best ( Figure-2 ).  It is worth noting there was less variance in the bioethics knowledge based on quiz takers religious background then the variance when looking at each biomedical issue (error bars in  Figure-1  vs  Figure-2 ).  Put another way, the overall bioethics knowledge within social groups (religious backgrounds) was more consistent than the knowledge of all people about independent bioethical issues.  As students progressed through medical school their knowledge of biomedical issues as they pertain to the world religions improved ( p = 0.022)  ( Figure-3 )."
"41" "Discussion"
"42" "The bioethical stances held by major world religions has been put into an online grid and quiz format with a social competitive reporting structure to help increase its use and educational value. There were few, and sometimes no, users from certain religious backgrounds that took the online quiz, so the analysis comparing those groups is very limited, but will grow as more people use this online tool.  While this study  was done  with medical students, the online quiz is set up to allow all healthcare personnel to take the quiz including physicians, nursing students, physical therapists, pharmacists, etc. As more users take the  quiz  comparisons can be made between different generations of physicians: from first year medical students, to residents, all the way to attending physicians. Additionally, the competitive grouping of scores by email domain should generate interesting data about hospitals/clinics and the medical, nursing, and pharmacy schools  that feed into them.  The bioethics chosen for the grid were issues the authors thought were prominent in medical and legislative discussions.  It should be noted the grid heavily tested beliefs surrounding conception with  5  of the 9 rows dealing directly with procreation.  Namely, sterilization, contraception, and three types of abortion rows based on stage of fetus (pre-implantation, pre-heartbeat, post-heartbeat).  Future work could include quizzes given as part of a course grade or repeated quiz taking by individuals  to more accurately track  the ability of this format to instill lasting knowledge."
