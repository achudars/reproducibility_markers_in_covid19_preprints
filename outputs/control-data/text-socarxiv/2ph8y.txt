Abstract. The intensification of food production plays a central role in the evolution of
complex human societies. However, it is unclear if the standard model of intensification is
theoretically or empirically justified. This leaves social scientists unable to make reasonable
inferences about the relationship between intensification and the evolution of social complexity in past societies. To remedy this problem, I derive a novel model of intensification from
human macroecology, settlement scaling theory, human behavioral ecology, cultural evolutionary theory, and niche construction theory. The standard and cultural niche construction
models are formalized and their predictions are tested using a comprehensive ethnographic
data set that describes food production in forty human societies ranging in complexity from
foraging bands to agricultural states. Analysis of the ethnographic record suggests we reject
the standard model and tentatively accept the cultural niche construction model. I attempt
to demonstrate the broader utility of the cultural niche construction model as a framework
that may help explain the transition from small-scale to large-scale complex societies.
Main. The intensification of food production has been modeled in two ways in social evolutionary theory. In classical theory, technological innovation reduces the labor required for
food production which, in turn, leads to the division of labor, population growth, and the
evolution of social complexity [1‚Äì6]. In the standard model of contemporary theory, intensification is argued to be an increasingly labor-intensive process necessitated by population
growth and political exploitation [7‚Äì20]. Ethnographic data has been used to challenge [21‚Äì
24] or support [25‚Äì33] the standard model but no comprehensive analysis the ethnographic
record has been undertaken. (A detailed intellectual history of the intensification literature
is provided in SI Text.) This lack of consensus is a grave problem for social scientists whose
inferences about the relationships between innovation, labor productivity, intensification,
and the evolution of social complexity in past societies are valid only to the extent to which
adequate ethnographic evidence exists.
This paper seeks to resolve this problem and advance our theoretical and empirical
knowledge of intensification. I derive a new model of intensification‚Äîthe cultural niche construction model‚Äîthat synthesizes theory and data from human macroecology, settlement
scaling theory, human behavioral ecology, cultural evolutionary theory, and niche construction theory. I then formalize and test the predictions of the standard and cultural niche
construction models using a comprehensive quantitative data set that describes food production in forty ethnographically-known societies ranging in complexity from foraging bands
to agricultural states (Table 1; Materials and Methods). The ethnographic record provides
no support for the standard model and suggests we tentatively accept the cultural niche
construction model. In the discussion section, I demonstrate the broader utility of the cultural niche construction model as a mechanism-based, mathematical framework that may
further our understanding of evolution of large-scale complex societies.
The standard model. The first assumption of the standard model is that more intensive
systems are less productive per unit of energy input, Ein . Let the labor productivity P of
1

a food production system at a given technological level  be defined as the mean ratio of
energy output, Eout , to Eh , the fraction of Ein derived solely from human labor:
P = h

Eout
i
Eh

(1)

The first prediction of the standard model can stated as the following inequality:
P > P+k

(2)

where k indexes progressively more intensive systems. The second assumption of the standard model is what is known in economics as the ‚Äúlaw of diminishing marginal returns‚Äù
to food producing labor. The law states that any single-input food production function is
characterized by decreasing then negative marginal returns [34‚Äì36]. We can formalize the
marginal returns to energy input as a linear relationship and the production function as its
integral, a second-order polynomial. The second prediction of the standard model can be
formally stated as
dEout
= b ‚àí 2aEin
dEin

(3)

2
Eout = bEin ‚àí aEin
+

(4)

where  is a constant that describes the technological and institutional context in which
food production takes place and a and b describe how Ein and Eout are marginally related.
The behavior that follows from this model is that rational food producers will increase input until the maximum output in a given context is achieved; once output begins to fall,
producers will invent or adopt technologies that allow for intensification while sacrificing
labor productivity (Figure 1).
The cultural niche construction model. Two hallmarks of social evolution are urbanization and the division of labor. As the populations of settlements and cities within
complex societies grow, they are divided into an increasingly large array of professional
and organizational roles, all of which must be fed by an increasingly small number of food
producers [37‚Äì41]. The rates of urbanization in the earliest states in Mesopotamia, Egypt,
the Indus Valley, China, Mesoamerica, and the Andes range from ‚àº30 to 95% [42] and
archaeological evidence suggests that a variety of intensive agricultural technologies were
used at this time [31, 43‚Äì47]. This suggests that cross-cultural agricultural labor productivity ‚àº5500‚Äì1500 years ago was already reaching relatively modern levels [48]. The first
prediction of the cultural niche construction model follows from the empirical observation
that labor productivity appears to increases as food production technologies and politically
organized cities develop:
P < P+k

(5)

The second prediction of the cultural niche construction model derives from the sublinear
scaling of area with population, such that A = aN Œ± where a is a normalization constant and
Œ± is a scaling exponent less than 1 that describes how area and population are marginally
related [49, 50]. Spatial equilibrium results from balancing the costs of moving people,
materials, and information over a given area with the benefits of social interaction and
exchange among individuals and with the environment [50‚Äì52]. The cost of movement
2

over a distance L can be expressed as cL where c is the energetic cost per unit length in
a given technological and institutional context. Any given area‚Äîwhether organized as a
hunter-gatherer territory, an agricultural state, or a modern city‚Äîis characterized by an
infrastructural network that facilitates interaction between all members of a population. If
we assume that the distribution of a population N over a given area A is density-dependent,
then, on average, every member of the population will occupy a unit of area (A/N ) and
require (A/N )1/2 units of infrastructure to insure connection with the rest of the population.
The total length of the network Ln = N (A/N )1/2 = aN Œ≤ , where A = aN Œ± and Œ≤ = (1+Œ±)/2
[50, 52, 53]. By multiplying the length of the infrastructural network Ln by the cost of
movement c we obtain the energetic cost of social life in a given area:
E = N Œ≤

(6)

where  describes the technological and institutional context that mediates between energetic
costs and benefits, E is total energy output, N is population size, and Œ≤ describes how
population and the infrastructural network are marginally related.
This simple model of population-level energy use allows for the derivation of an individuallevel (food) energy production function. We can think of the left hand side of Equation 6 as
the total energy output or consumed by a given population and the right hand side as representing the energy input required to generate this level of output. On the left hand side, E
can be rewritten as the size of the population multiplied by the average energy output per
out
)). On the right hand side, N can be rewritten as the size of the population
person (N ( EN
multiplied by the average energy input per person (N ( ENin )). These substitutions lead to
the following equation
Eout
Ein Œ≤
N(
) = (N (
))
(7)
N
N
which simplifies to the second prediction of the macroecological model:
Œ≤
Eout = Ein

(8)

where  is a constant that describes the technological and institutional context in which
food production occurs and Œ≤ describes how energy input and output are marginally related. The societies described in the Ethnographic Atlas are characterized by an Œ± value
of approximately 1/2 [49] so we predict a Œ≤ value for food production in the ethnographic
record close to 3/4. The behavior predicted by the cultural niche construction model derives from principles of cultural evolutionary theory, niche construction theory, and human
behavioral ecology acting in concert under the constraint of sublinear marginal returns imposed by Equation 8. Cultural niche construction theory predicts that energy output will
be maximized by human societies [54] while the principle of net energy maximization of
human behavioral ecology predicts that individuals will minimize the energy input required
to achieve a given level of output [55, 56]. The only means to achieve these goals simultaneously is a continual process of niche construction and technological innovation that increases
output and labor productivity (Figure 1).
Results. Foraging, extensive, intensive, and early industrial food production technologies
produce .01, 7, 14, and 15 gigajoules per hectare per year, on average. The labor productivity values associated with these technologies are 10, 30, 53, and 125 units of energy output
per unit of human energy input. Thus, labor productivity increases with intensification
(Figure 2). The standard model fails to predict the relationship between energy input and
3

output or the behavior of  as food production is intensified. The cultural niche construction model accurately predicts the marginal relationship between energy input and output,
the behavior of  as food production is intensified, and the value of Œ≤. A multiple linear
regression of the logarithm of energy output on the logarithm of energy input and food
production technology has a slope of Œ≤ = .76 and explains over 95% of variation in output
(Table 2). The intensification of food production in the ethnographic record is accurately
described by the cultural niche construction model. This analysis strongly suggests we reject
the standard model.
Discussion.
There are, broadly speaking, two traditions of social evolutionary theory
in which intensification plays a central role (see SI Text). The classical and contemporary
models of intensification are, however, flawed and it is unclear if inferences based on these
models about the relationships between innovation, intensification, population growth, and
social evolution in past societies are reasonably justified. In other words, there are large-scale
patterns in the ethnographic, archaeological, and historical records that are not adequately
explained by current theory. In enlightenment and liberal evolutionary theories, technological innovation allows for a reduction in the amount of labor required for food production
which, in turn, allows for intensification, population growth, and the development of social
complexity in a strictly linear process. The empirical claim of increasing labor productivity
is justified by the ethnographic record but the classical model lacks a mechanistic framework that explains how or why innovation should take place at all, much less how innovation
rates ought to vary as large-scale complex societies develop. Similar problems plague the
romantic, Marxist, and postmodern tradition in which it is incorrectly assumed that intensification is an increasingly labor-intensive process. More problematic is the standard model‚Äôs
causal framework in which population growth and social complexity exist prior to and cause
the development of more intensive food production. While it is reasonable to assume that
large-scale, densely-populated, complex societies will have advantages in creating new food
production technologies, it is unclear how or why social complexity can or ought to develop
under initial conditions of perpetual food scarcity and winner-take-all exploitation. Both
the classical and contemporary models make important contributions to our understanding
of intensification but need to be synthesized with the ethnographic data compiled here and
the social scientific principles that underpin the cultural niche construction model.
The theory and data presented here provide a mechanistic and mathematical framework
with which social scientists can make reasonable inferences about the dynamic cross-cultural
process which links innovation, intensification, population growth, and the evolution of largescale complex societies (Figure 3). The process outlined in Figure 3 gives causal primacy
to the processes of cultural evolution and niche construction, or what has been termed
‚Äúcultural niche construction‚Äù [54]. Cultural niche construction recognizes the primary role
played by the evolved capacity to acquire, comprehend, and transmit knowledge about what
Odling-Smee and colleagues [57] refer to as the ‚Äúcasual texture‚Äù of the biotic and abiotic
environment. The development of technologies, knowledge, and norms used to manage the
biotic and abiotic environment are found universally [24, 27, 33, 58, 59] and variation in
these cultural practices directly effect the productivity of labor and land. Innovations in food
production technology and norms that increase the intensity of food production and labor
productivity are selected for at two levels: (1) at the individual level, where the principle
of net energy maximization dictates that more productive technologies will be adopted;
and, (2) at the population level, where intergroup competition will, through a variety of
mechanisms, tend to select for cultural traits of larger populations[60, 61], as the systematic

4

and global spread of farming cultures since the Neolithic illustrates [62, 63].
Here I focus on one iteration of the process of intensification, the transition from foraging to traditional farming. There is no reason to assume that past changes in land use,
labor productivity, and population cannot be modeled using the ethnographic data reported
here and in the Ethnographic Atlas [64]. Although we must recognize that contemporary
foragers occupy more marginal lands than was the case thousands of years ago and that the
traditional farming of the ethnographic record is likely more productive than its ancestor
practices, correcting for these errors (work for future research) is very unlikely to alter the
basic patterns documented here. Using this data we can reasonably infer that the transition
from foraging to traditional farming led, on average, to a four-fold increase in labor productivity, a forty-fold increase in energy output, a thousand-fold increase in the intensity of food
production, and a four-fold increase in population. In the archaeological record, the high
rate of population growth that followed the transition from foraging to farming is known
as the neolithic demographic transition [65, 66]. The neolithic demographic transition is
hypothesized to have resulted from the increased fertility associated with the reduction in
labor required for food production and the decreased mortality associated with a growth in
the food supply (energy output). This mechanism can likely be generalized to any energy
transition in which carrying capacity grows more quickly than population [67, 68].
The results of this paper provide empirical data that supports the hypothetical mechanisms proposed by scholars studying the neolithic demographic transition (and subsequent
transitions). In addition to population growth, the the transition from foraging to farming
also allowed for (1) an increase in population density, sedentary settlement, and urbanization, as the land use required for food production decreased by orders of magnitude; and,
(2) the division of labor, as, on average, the work required for food production decreased
from over 4 hours per day per person (Table 3) to roughly 1 hour per day person. The
development of increasingly large, dense, and economically-specialized populations living in
urban settlements required the development of political organization to facilitate cooperation between large numbers of genetically and culturally unrelated individuals and groups
[42, 69].
So far, this model of social evolution has proceeded along the tracks of the enlightenment and liberal model to its end point. And here we must fuse the classical model of
intensification with the standard model‚Äôs insight that large, dense populations have advantages in creating new food production technologies which feedback into the basal process
of cultural niche construction. Politically-organized urban populations exhibit increasing
returns to scale in terms of rates of technological innovation [70, 71]. In other words, the
rate of technological innovation in politically-organized settlements and cities begins to grow
more quickly than population meaning that the division of labor and carrying capacity also
grow more quickly than population. This property of politically-organized settlements and
cities creates a virtuous circle of increasing innovation, intensification, population growth,
and economic and political complexity, and is likely only one instance of the exploitation of
positive feedback mechanisms which seem to be a general property of the process of cultural
niche construction [72‚Äì74].

Figure 1. The standard and macroecological models illustrated. In the standard model, food
producers increase energy input until the maximum output in a given technological and institutional
context is achieved; once output begins to fall producers will invent or adopt technologies that allow
for intensification while sacrificing labor productivity. In the macroecological model, food producers
continually engage in niche construction and technological innovation to maximize output and labor
productivity.

Figure 3 illustrates the mechanisms and mathematics of the dynamics of the cultural niche construction model. This illustration assumes that the basal process of cultural niche construction
and technological innovation only affects , although clearly technologies and norms also change
the values of a, Œ±, and Œ≤. As food producers acquire and transmit knowledge of their biotic and
abiotic environment, innovations in food production technologies and norms are introduced that
increase the values of  and E while decreasing the value of A. This intensification of food production increases labor productivity and the overall food supply in a given area, which increases
population by increasing fertility and decreasing mortality. As human populations become large,
dense, and sedentary, political institutions must develop in order to overcome the centrifugal forces
of scalar stress and facilitate cooperation among genetically and culturally unrelated groups. The
rates of technological innovation in populations of politically-organized settlements and cities grow
faster than the populations themselves, and this feeds back into the basal process of cultural niche
construction. The process, once the barriers to its first iteration are overcome, is autocatalytic.

Materials and methods. The data set analyzed in this paper describes food production
in forty human societies ranging in sociopolitical complexity from foraging groups to agricultural states. This data was collected from primary ethnographic sources in which food
production was studied over a given amount of time and area. The criteria for inclusion
in the data set were that the technology, intensity, energy input, energy output, and area
were recorded or calculable. More specifically, the criteria for inclusion in the data set were
that: (1) the food production technology (e.g., foraging, extensive, intensive, or early industrial) was clearly identified; (2) the amount of labor (human, animal, and/or machine) was
recorded in units of time or energy; (3) the food output was reported by volume, weight,

or caloric value; and (4) the area of land used for food production was recorded or, in the
case of foragers, was available from other sources. 520 food production case studies in 40
societies described in the ethnographic record met these criteria. While the data set is,
to my knowledge, exhaustive with respect to the criteria outlined above, there are many
dimensions of possible variation that the data sources do not record and are therefore not
accounted for by the analyses performed here. The inclusion of data that describe sedentary foragers in extremely productive environments, farmers from highly arid environments
with weak property rights, or low-level food producers who practice mixed foraging-farming
strategies would all, assumably, have appreciable effects on the analyses. The crops represented in farming data set are also largely limited to maize, rice, and wheat, though sweet
potatoes, taro, and sugar cane are also in the sample. The lack of data on non-grain staple
crops introduces another potential bias in the data.
Intensity was operationalized as energy output per unit area of land per unit time [110]
and reported in gigajoules per hectare per year in the body of the paper but reported in
MJ/ha/year in the SI data set. Because the vast majority of forager food production cases
were daily in temporal scope and undertaken by individuals, the following calculations were
made to make the data comparable to farmer data. Eout for a given day of foraging was
calculated by assuming an 4.3 hour day (see Table 2) and multiplied by 365. For example,
if a forager is recorded as producing 1 MJ/h, Eout = 1 MJ/hour/person x 4.3 hours/day
x 365 days/year = 1569.6 MJ/person/year. This figure was then divided by the area per
person in a given territory (the inverse of population density for a given ethnolinguistic
group) A/N , taken from Binford‚Äôs hunter-gatherer data set [111]. This resulted in a figure
with the dimensions of annual power density, MJ/ha/year.
The methods for calculating energy input and output for the case studies is detailed
below. The proxy used to measure energy input Ein is the amount of human, animal,
and/or machine labor expended to produce food. For farmers, this quantity is usually
reported in the ethnographic sources in ‚Äúman-days.‚Äù In order to make the foraging and
farming data comparable, I converted all ‚Äúman-days‚Äù to 6.5 ‚Äúman-hours‚Äù and all ‚Äúmanhours‚Äù to moderate person-hours of work (see Table 3; refs. [119, 120] also report a 6.5
hour day among modern Mexican and Central American laborers). Smil [ref. [33], p. 60]
estimates that an average person-hour of work is equivalent to 0.8 MJ. The energy energy
expended to produce food by h hours of human labor was calculated as:
Ein = h ¬∑ 0.8MJh‚àí1

This measure of energy input Ein is robust to variation among persons and between groups
and ought to have cross-cultural applicability.
Similar calculations were made to account for non-human energetic input. The use of
oxen, water buffalo, and horses in food production are reported in the ethnographic sources.
These animals expend, on average, 1.44 MJh‚àí1 , 1.44 MJh‚àí1 , and 2.34 MJh‚àí1 , respectively
[ref. [33], p. 67]. The number of these animals and the quantity of time or the exact
tasks they are used for are detailed in the sources. However, in one case [79] the time
over which the buffalo were used had to be estimated at 40% of the agricultural season
[ref. [33], p. 65]. In the case of early industrial wheat production in Kansas in the early
1920s [98], the tractor make and model had to be inferred from what was produced and
available to farmers in that region at the time and its power rating was taken from a study
conducted by the Department of Agriculture, University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln (available
at https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/tractormuseumlit/623/). Although animal and machine
input are non-human in origin, they are measured in the common currency of energy and‚Äî
from the food production system‚Äôs point of view‚Äîare indistinguishable from human input.
Measuring the energy output Eout of the food production system is generally more
straightforward. In the case of plant cultivation the energetic output was reported as the
volume, weight, or caloric value of a given weight of food. These measurements came in an
array of indigenous metrics all of which were converted to kilograms of food. This weight
was then multiplied by the foods‚Äôs gravimetric energy density. The same approach was used
in the case of hunting and foraging output. The energetic output of the food production
system was measured as
Eout,i = kg resourcei ¬∑ gravimetric energy density of resourcei (MJ/kg)

(10)

Below, I provide the reader with two examples of how the raw data was converted into
the energy input and energy output data recorded. Barker et al.[81] report intensive rice
farming data for several countries. The energy input is reported in man-days per hectare
and buffalo-days per hecare. Both of these figures were multiplied by 6.5 hours/day to
obtain man-hours/ha and buffalo-hours/ha. The man-hours were multiplied by .8 MJ/hour
and the buffalo-hours were multiplied by 1.33 MJ/hour; these figures were summed (MJ/ha)
and multiplied by the number of hectares to arrive at the energy input figure (MJ). The
energy output was reported as kilograms of rice per hectare. This figure (kg rice/ha) was
11

multiplied by 14.9 MJ/kg rice and the number of hectares over which it was grown to
arrive at an energy output figure in MJ. Cane [99] reports energy input and output data
for Gugadja foragers. The energy input was reported in man-minutes which was multipled
by 60 min/hour and .8 MJ/person-hour to arrive at a figure in MJ. The energy output was
reported in kilocalories which was multiplied by 0.004184 MJ/kcal to obtain energy output
in MJ.
The rates of urbanization in early states were calculated using the Supplementary Data
given by Sandeford [42]. These data measure either the population or the area of settlements
within a given polity and are sorted hierarchically into tiers based on the modal distribution
of settlement sizes. Urbanization was calculated as the percentage of the population living
in capital cities and regional centers (tiers 1 and 2 of the settlement distributions). As many
of these estimates are based solely on area, they tend to underestimate the population living
in larger settlements and the overall rates of urbanization [129].
The rate of population growth reported in the Discussion for the Ethnographic Atlas [64]
was calculated by regressing the average population value at a given level of intensity on the
index of intensity (variable 28) where this index is an ordinal scale ranging from 1 indicating
no agriculture to 7 indicating intensive irrigated agriculture. As intensity is intended to be
an ordinal scale I changed the value of horticulture from 4 to 2 but otherwise left the order
preserved.
All statistical analyses were done in R. The regressions performed to test the fit of the
standard model were ordinary least-squares linear models of Eout on Ein using the poly
function to transform Ein . The regressions performed to test to fit of the macroecological

Supplementary Information Text. Intellectual history of intensification in the
social science literature.
There are, broadly speaking, two traditions in social evolutionary theory. In the classical
tradition‚Äîderiving from enlightement and liberal thought‚Äîinfluential figures such as White
[4], Childe [5], and Adams [6] argued that intensification was associated with a significant
reduction in the labor required for food production which, in turn, led to the hallmarks of
complex societies such as an increasing division of labor, technological innovation, and population growth, all of which were interlinked in a process of continuous material progress.
This view was challenged in the mid-late twentieth century as political, demographic, and
ecological concerns profoundly changed social scientists‚Äô attitudes toward state-level social
organization, economic development, and modern technology [17, 130]. The social evolutionary theory formulated in this context [16‚Äì19] reflected these concerns and was heavily
influenced by German romanticism, Marxism, and postmodernism [131, 132]. As Bruce
Trigger (ref. [133], p. 411) writes, a new theoretical paradigm emerged in which intensification was viewed as having ‚Äúcompelled most people to work harder, suffer increasing
exploitation, and degrade their environments.‚Äù The contemporary theoretical consensus

12

that intensification is an increasingly labor-intensive process necessitated by population
pressure or political demands for surplus production was originally articulated by Wittfogel
[7]‚Äîwho was heavily influenced by Weber and Marx‚Äîand solidified over the course of the
1960s by a number of prominent social scientists [8, 10‚Äì13].
The work of Danish economist Ester Boserup [9, 70] became extremely influential in
this context. It articulated the mid-twentieth century theoretical consensus in the form of
a simple, parsimonious, evolutionary model of the relationship between agricultural intensity, population, and sociopolitical complexity. Boserup argued that growth in population
and sociopolitical complexity necessitated intensification which, in most cases, required the
invention or adoption of more labor-intensive technologies. Her work thus allowed social
scientists to create powerful mechanism-based, deductive, cross-cultural models of the evolution of human societies, often with very limited data (e.g., evidence of population growth
and the development of a settlement hierarchy). The appeal of such a model is difficult to
overstate.
The empirical validity of the standard model, however, remained contested. It has been
supported or challenged using a variety ethnographic data but no comprehensive analysis the
ethnographic record has been undertaken. Hawkes et al. [21] and Piperno and Pearsall [22]
find that labor productivity increases as the transition from foraging to farming is made
among the Machiguenga, YanomamoÃà, and AcheÃÅ of the Amazon. Bowles [25] uses crosscultural historical and ethnographic data to model the productivity of foraging and early
farming and argues early farming required more labor. Clark and Haswell [26], Netting [27],
Kirch [28], and Stone [29] find evidence for the standard model in African and Polynesian
case studies. Sanders [30, 31] uses ethnoarchaeological data to study the transition from
swidden to plow, irrigated, and raised-field agriculture in ancient Mesoamerica. Although
he was an exponent of the standard model, his data show that intensification is in every
case associated with increased labor productivity. Using cross-cultural historical and ethnographic data, Bronson [23] concludes that more intensive forms of farming are universally
associated with higher labor productivity. Hunt [24] uses ethnographic data to compare
the labor productivity of traditional swidden and irrigated rice farming in southeast Asia
and finds higher productivity among the more intensive systems. Smil‚Äôs [33] global account
of the emergence and intensification of agriculture relies on reconstructions of labor productivity based on historical and ethnographic sources and lends support to the standard
model.
