"2" "Egg Selection   in the United States"
"3" "In the science fiction film  Gattaca , a eugenic dystopia  is portrayed ,   in which parents select  and pay for  the  desirable traits  they wish to appear in  their  future offspring. While th e  scenario  of parents selecting height, mathematical ability, and athletic prowess for their children  has obviously not come to reality, the United States  fertility industry trades on the latent and explicit  desire s  of intended parents to  influence their children’s destinies .  This  chapter  examines how United States fertility industry providers rely upon the ideology of “selection” and racialized and eugenic ideas about the genetic capacity of gametes to market their services to a domestic and international clientele. This is exemplified in the practices by which industry employees recruit, screen, and select egg  “donors , ”  carefully managing  egg donor  pools as a marketing device to appeal to intended parents worldwide who desire children of a particular racial-ethnic background, physical appearance, or personality trait.  Because  the use of third-party eggs is a market transaction rather than a gift economy  in the United States context , I herein use the phrase egg transfer rather than egg donation, and egg provider or vendor rather than donor, except in the context of direct quotes  (see also Cooper & Waldby, 2014) ."
"4" "Scholars have made comparisons between contemporary practices involving genetics and assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs)  with  older eugenic practices from the early twentieth century  (Duster, 2003; Fujimura, Rajagopalan, & Duster, 2008; Roberts, 2011; Rothman, 2001) .  During the eugenics era , traits such as intelligence, promiscuity, poverty, and criminality were believed to be heritable qualities passed down through one’s genes; this belief was linked with  biological determinism and the idea that biology is destiny  (Kevles, 1995) .   In  contrast ,  assisted  reproductive technologies  were developed as  seemingly innocuous practices that help the infertile to have biological children, with no concrete relationship to last century’s state-sanctioned eugenics movement involving large populations.  Third-party egg transfer, for example, was initially developed as an  assistive  technology  to  enabl e   infertile  women to conceive using another woman’s eggs. Further more ,  unlike old-fashioned eugenics,  ARTs today involve market-oriented transactions mediated not by the state, but by private agencies and medical clinics, in order to facilitate the birth of individual children  rather than populations ."
"5" "Yet  ARTs   may become  selective reproductive technologies (SRT s) when  genetic determinist ideologies  and the desire  to manipulate the outcome of offspring  motivate   and contribute to  third-party  egg  transfer  and other technologies .  SRTs  are linked to the power to facilitate the birth of children to certain classes of women—and thus its arguable linkage with new forms of positive eugenics  (Davis, 1993) .  The decision to parent always involves risk, whether that  is  through “natural”  or assisted  conception , or  by  fostering/adoption.  S RTs such as  third-party  egg transfer, sperm sorting and PGD , however,  may be used to  mitigate  risks and  give  intended parents  some modic um of control over the “product ” by assessing, ranking, and selecting gametes and embryos. This screening and assessing is taking place on a global scale, enabled by reproductive tourism for selective purposes   (Martin, 2014) ."
"6" "United States fertility industry providers  may inadvertently reify eugenic ideas about genetic “fitness” through their processes of recruiting, screening, selecting, and marketing of gamete  providers .  The presentation of  a pre-screened and diverse  donor pool  becomes  a marketing device to appeal to intended parents worldwide who desire children of a particular racial-ethnic background, physical appearance, or personality trait.  G iven the size and pluralism of the United States , as well as the fact that commercial  third-party egg transfer  is legal, its  egg  market  is  larger and more diverse than other countries’ egg donor pools. By appealing to intended parents to come to the United States as a means to “select” traits in their future offspring by way of egg donation, American fertility industry practices may serve to undermine officially sanctioned norms and values  regarding eugenics and selective technologies  in those intended parents’ own countries."
"7" "METHOD AND BACKGROUND"
"8" "New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are three of the largest nodes of the fertility industry in the United States. This paper is based on a larger research project in which I conducted multi-sited fieldwork and in-depth interviews  in these three cities  with twenty people employed in the fertility industry as physicians, egg and surrogate brokers, and family law attorneys, among other occupations  (Martin, 2015) . In addition, I conducted  an  analysis of United States fertility clinic websites  and Craigslist postings  for their recruiting and marketing  content , and  examined public and professional policies regarding the uses and applications of reproductive technologies.  Pseudonyms are used for all providers. To further maintain confidentiality, websites and Craigslist postings by fertility clinics and agencies are a distinct sample from the agencies where I conducted interviews."
"9" "Fertility clinics and agencies in dozens of countries compete for clients on a global basis, offering such services as surrogacy, IVF, egg transfer, PGD, and sex selection  (Hudson et al., 2011; Inhorn & Gürtin, 2011; Spar, 2006) .  Countries such as India, Nepal,  Thailand, Spain, and the United States, among others, have emerged as destinations for individuals seeking assisted fertility services and SRTs  (Nygren, Adamson, Zegers-Hochschild, & de Mouzon, 2010) .  Although it does not provide bargain prices for expensive  fertility  services, the United States has  become an ideal marketplace for “reproductive tourists”   seeking out reproductive technologies that are illegal, inaccessible, and/or of limited quantity and quality in their own countries  (Twine, 2011) . Specifically, a more laissez-faire orientation regarding reproductive technologies makes the United State a favorable place for those intended parents, globally, who wish to use such selective  reproductive  technologies as commercial egg  transfer , pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and sex selection  (Martin, 2015) ."
"10" "Ideas about genetic heritability and consumer choice are embedded in the U.S. fertility industry , the attitudes of its workers, and regional norms and practices.  Fostering the illusion to intended parents that they  can  “select”  traits in  their  egg  provider  (and, it follows, in  their  future offspring) is an appealing  marketing  device, particularly to  foreign nationals  who are  unable to acquire  the same technologies in their own countries . Despite ot her nations’ laws and policies that may restrict eugenic or selective technologies, they become available to those willing to travel to the United States ."
"11" "Buying and selling eggs is  outlawed  in  many  countries,  including Australia, Belgium, Canada, and France,  and  noncommercial egg  transfer  is prohibited in Germany, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland  (Jones, Cooke, Kempers, Brinsden, & Saunders, 2010) .  Third-party egg transfer  in the United States , on the other hand,  is largely a commercial, rather than an altruistic, enterprise  (Almeling, 2011) .  In the U.S. egg market, young women may legally sell their ova for any agreed-upon price, with $8000 per cycle being a typical amount for compensation. Without any federal or state-level policies regulating the sale of eggs for reproductive purposes ( as opposed to for stem cell research ), the fertility industry attempts to self-regulate the market  through its own practice guidelines  (Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2007) ."
"12" "RECRUITING EGG VENDORS"
"13" "In the United States,  an industry of  brokers  and agencies work to locate egg vendors by advertising  on college campuses and  Craigslist,  recruiting via  their own web sites,  and by word of mouth . Brokers spoke to me about how they are constantly recruiting to find what they perce ive to be the “best”  egg providers .  This was ironically revealed to me during the course of my research, as I was on more than one occasion solicited for my eggs. The  president of a Los Angeles egg agency,  who  remarked that she is “always recruiting donors,”  attempted to recruit me at the end of our interview. When I informed her that I was “too old,” at least according to  her agency’s age limit , she suggested I  ask  my  younger  friends to consider selling their eggs. Another broker  I met at a fertility conference unsuccessfully  attempted to recruit me when she found out that I was, at the time, a PhD candidate."
"14" "Craigslist in New York City, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area offers a daily snapshot of the recruiting tactics of clinics and agencies.  A search for the term “egg donor” in the Jobs section on May 29, 2015, yield ed   171   recent posts in New York,  70   in Los Angeles, and  84  in the San Francisco Bay Area . Although   Craigslist  New York  ha d  the  highest  number of advertisements, these include d  multiple postings by the same  16 fertility clinics and agencies.  19 clinics, agencies, and individual recruiters   (including a couple conducting a search for themselves) account ed  for 70 postings in  Los Angeles , and in San Francisco, 13 clinics, agencies, and recruiters account ed  for 84 postings ."

"34" "35%  (n = 29)"
"35" "Given the size and pluralism of the United States, the egg market is potentially enormous and heterogeneous. However, all ova are not interchangeable or equally desired.  Craigslist advertisements  list preferred qualities  such as  race/ ethnicity,  SAT scores, hair color, and talents .   Almost three-quarters (73.7%) of the recruiting posts on New York’s Craigslist  specify  race or ethnicity. These include: African American, Armenian, Asian, Brazilian, Caribbean, Caucasian, Ethiopian, Greek, Indian, Italian, Jewish, Lebanese, Mediterranean, Puerto Rican, Scandinavian, and South American. Stating a desired race or ethnicity  in the subject heading  is  prevalent but  not as common in California: in Los Angeles, 37% of posts indicate race or ethnicity (Asian, Caucasian, East Indian , and Middle Eastern ), and in San Francisco, 35% of posts request specific races/ethnicities (Asian, Caucasian, Chinese, and Jewish).   At least two of the race/ethnicity-specific advertisements were posted by race/ethnicity-specific companies, Asian Egg Donor Agency and A Jewish Blessing.  In all three egg markets, the ova of  white  and Asian women are the most  requested , but many advertisements also overtly state that they welcome applications from women from all ethnicities ; non-white and non-Asian  women  may be included in a broker’s pool of potential egg  providers  even if they never get matched with intended parents ."
"36" "SCREENING CANDIDATES"
"37" "Agencies and clinics are selective about their egg providers, usually stating minimum criteria on their  websites and  advertisements. For example, an advertisement posted by the PAMF Fertility Physicians of Northern California states that women should apply if they are: “ between 21-28 years old, healthy and within a normal weight range, have a healthy family  history, non-smoker and drug-free, and able to reliably attend up to 10 appointments in San Jose, CA”  (PAMF Fertility Physicians of Northern California, 2015) .  Once they have applied, the women are further screened  via extensive and exhaustive applications. These may require applicants to supply detailed information about their physical appearance, occupation, and medical history, as well as that of their parents, grandparents, siblings, and children.  Some agencies and clinics require applicants to supply SAT scores and  grade point average s, rate their mechanical, mathematical, literary, scientific, athletic, musical, and artistic abilities, list their special talents,  include a  community service record, and describe their personality and goals in life.  They are asked to quantify their ancestors’ countries of origin, disclose information about their relationship status, and provide psychological, menstrual, sexual, and pregnancy histories   (See also Almeling, 2011) ."
"38" "Applicants are subject to medical and psychological screening by fertility clinics prior to selection.  According to Liz, program coordinator  at a New York clinic , “We do quite a lot of screening on the donors here. We go well over what is recommended and required by state and federal law.  So  if they have an abnormal pap smear, if they have HPV … that will delay our process, because we will … make sure that everything is fine, and we won’t cycle anyone unless they’re okay, or checked out. … And we do genetics, we do psych, we do th e physical exams, and the blood  work. That whole thing.”   They do  not accept as vendors women who “have alcoholism in the family, or if they were taking anxiety medications, for depression or something like that.”"
"39" "Some medical screenings and selection criteria are arguably used to reduce the risks of disease transmission  as regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,  or to gauge the viability of an individual woman’s ova   (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007) . But   women  are  also  recruited and selected on the basis of  socially determined  criteria , such as  height or education,  that have nothing to do with disease risk or  egg viability .  Women who wish to sell their eggs via the agency A Perfect Match must provide official transcripts and standardized test scores  (A Perfect Match, 2008b) . A  post  that  appears on all three  Craigslists   offers up to $50,000 for “an Attractive Caucasian Candidate who attends/has attended an Ivy League School … This specific couple is looking to find a candidate who looks similar to them, so a light eye color, 5’7 or over in height, and any particular hair color”  (“Caucasian, Educated Donor Needed! **$50,000 a Cycle**,” n.d.) ."
"40" "The holistic screening process results in the creation of  a biography that includes physical description, social history, medical history, family background, and, most importantly, race/ethnicity,  enabling clinics and agencies  to place  women  in their roster  as both an advertising tool  and to be  potentially  matched with specific sets of intended parents.  During the eugenics movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the “fitness” of individuals determined whether or not they were worthy of propagating their gene pool  (Kevles, 1995) . This belief about the fitness of individuals—and of entire populations—influenced by theories  of  heritability of traits,  resulted in both  positive and negative eugenic practices. Almost a century later, the screening of egg vendor applicants  implies similar   distinctions  between fit and unfit egg vendors—that is, by who is fit enough to sell genetic material—and  similar beliefs in the heritability of  traits such as  race , intelligence, and beauty.  By eliminating and including applicants based on their genetic, medical, familial, and social information, brokers “pre-select” the types of women judged to be fit to reproduce not on the physical quality of their eggs but on their biographical details."
"41" "Through  my  interviews with egg brokers, I came to the realization that the most important criterion for an egg vendor  to be added to an agency’s roster was her marketability, based on the brokers’ assessment of the likelihood of her being a good match with the intended  parents they sought as clients.  Megan,  marketing director  at a Los Angeles agency informed me ,  “A lot of the times they’ll [intended parents] want somebody who’s bright. And we work with a lot of models and actresses, and they get chosen all the time. So basically, we look for candidates that people would really choose.”  B eautiful women with high grade point averages and classical music training are assumed to be desirable candidates, whereas those who are overweight, have a history of mental illness, or lack a high school diploma, are disqualified.  Through recruiting and screening, egg brokers create and manage a pool of potential  egg providers  based on what the brokers themselves believe to be attractive and marketable qualities, reifying normative standards of beauty, intelligence, and markers of cultural capital  (Martin, 2014) ."
"42" "MARKETING EGGS"
"43" "Using marketability as the basis for  vendor  recruitment and selection is especially important in the global fertility marketplace. Egg brokers repeatedly remarked upon the “quality” of their  egg providers  as reasons for why their clients—especially those coming from abroad—choose to work with them, implying that they or their agencies are particularly adept at assessing and evaluating the genetic potential of young women.  Websites are one tool used by clinics and agencies to signal the quality of their egg vendors.  Megan tells me that as part of her responsibilities as marketing director, “I put all the donors up on our website, and make sure they look really appealing. Correct any spelling mistakes or anything like that.” Robin believes that it is the  advertised  quality of her donors that draws clients to want to work with her, but  acknowledges,   “the bar is not super high. ”"
"44" "Some agencies are even more transparent about egg transfer as an SRT.  The website of A Perfect Match Egg Donation and Gestational Surrogacy Agency,  based out of La Mesa, California, uses the language of heritability to market the superiority of their egg  providers . Their  Egg Donation  page  states that the agency “actively recruits intelligent women … who are also very accomplished in their personal lives in the areas of sports, arts, business, medicine, law and politics.” Further, without actually citing  any studies, the page continues:"
"45" "Many people do not understand or agree  that  personality or intelligence matters when it comes to choosing an egg donor yet there are many studies that show both personality and intelligence are very heritable traits. The majority of our intended parents select an egg donor based on a combination of factors which include the donor's accomplishments, personal appearance and her personality because they are truly trying to match them selves in as many ways possible.   (A Perfect Match, 2008a)"
"46" "Intended parents who use  clinics and agencies that allow  them  to select their own egg  providers  typically have access to  photographs and  other information from  their  applications that ha ve  been  catalogued and  made accessible over the Internet .   The agency  Egg Donation, Inc., provide s  photographs   and detailed information about their  egg providers  for anyone with an Internet connection to see. The ir  profile of Jodi (#57540), for example, includes her SAT score (960), history of pregnancies (2, no complications), ancestry (French, English, Welsh, Scottish), and favorite color (purple), among other intimate information  (Egg Donation Inc., 2015) . Other agencies are not so  transparent, and  require users to register before gaining access to their databases.  At West Coast Egg Donation, Inc., the  publically  available database  is searchable by blood type, race, ethnicity, eye color, hair color, and education level.   Users need to register in order to view the full profiles and photographs  (West Coast Egg Donation, 2015) ."
"47" "The attitudes of brokers indicates a contradictory stance, in which they market the qualities of their egg vendors at the same time they understand that  scientifically speaking, traits such as musical talent and SAT scores are not necessarily heritable qualities  (Martin, 2014) .  Yet claims by fertility industry professionals about the  high  qualities of  their  egg  vendor s  constructs  third-party egg transfer  as a selective technology . Not only does one have to assume that intelligence or behavioral traits are passed down from genetic parent to child, but that an egg  vendor ’s genetic  potential  can be revealed by looking at her test scores or where she attended college. While some intended parents may seek  vendor s  who resemble them in hopes of having children they can pass off as their own genetic progeny, others may use  this technology for expressly selective purposes ."
"48" "MATCHING EGGS  IN NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA"
"49" "In addition to the legal status of selling eggs as a marketable commodity, another distinguishing characteristic of the United States fertility industry is the process in which eggs are selected  by or  for intended parents.  Just as recruiting  and screening  egg providers  relies upon socially determined criteria, so does  this selection process .  Because so much value is placed in the qualities of egg  providers , and the implicit understanding that these qualities can be transmitted through their gametes, egg  providers  are individually matched with intended parents. In the cities studied for this field research, I have surmised two distinct patterns: whereas clinics and agencies in Los Angeles and San Francisco allow the intended parents to play a significant role in choosing their own egg  providers , sometimes even giving them the opportunity to meet  them  in person or over Skype, in New York City, the clinics tend to do the matching on behalf of the intended parents, keeping the identity (and even adult photographs) of the egg  providers  completely anonymous."
"50" "Anonymity does not eliminate the selective nature of third-party gamete transfer, but rather puts it in the hands of the professionals doing the selecting on behalf of the intended parents.  Dr. Bradley, in New York, lauded this practice of anonymous gamete donation, as long as the intended parents are able to have certain information about the donor. “Like if you want  sperm. You don’t know the person. But you know that he was, you know, six foot one with blond hair and green eyes, and he was of Scandinavian background, and he ’s an engineer, and his hobbies  are this, and he doesn’t have any diseases, and he has a picture  .. . I think that’s cool. And it should be exactly the same on the female side. That’s anonymous, in the sense they don’t know the person, but they had a say in choosing the gamete. I think that’s totally good and appropriate.”"
"51" "Liz , also in New York,  acknowledges that by selecting the egg vendors for their clients, intended parents  must  trust the clinic ’s matching skills . She describes a time when a Chinese patient doubted that the clinic employees would be abl e to find someone appropriate:"
"52" "Because we don’t show adult photos—we have an anonymous program…—the whole team matches the donors with the recipients, and so she said, ‘But you guys, you Caucasians, just think that we all look the same, so how can you match me with someone that looks like me?’ And I’m like, ‘Well, I see that you have, you know, a single eyelid,’ and this and this .. .  But,  I said ‘If there are certain traits or certain features that you absolutely do not want your donor to have, if you feel more comfortable doing so, send me photos of what you don’t want.’"
"53" "Again, the selection process at her clinic is quite robust, and geared towards choosing the “correct” gamete for the client."
"54" "Regional norms of selection and matching differ in California.  Although  brokers and professionals  in New York are satisfied with the regional norms of their field, some of their counterparts in California find their  own  methods more transparent and superior. Dr. Randolph, based in San Francisco,  describes the matching process in New York much the same way that Dr. Bradley and Liz did in the above passages. Yet Dr. Randolph  sounds disconcerted  that the fertility clinics  “make the choice themselves.  They look at the characteristics of the person, they  say, ‘This would be a good match for them, so we’ll pick this.’  So  you never know who it is, their background, or anything else.”"
"55" "Rebekah, co-owner of  a  surrogacy agency in Los Angeles,  describes clinics on the East Coast as having “in-house” egg programs where “there’s usually a long waiting list, and they don’t get as much information with an egg donor. They get maybe a baby picture, if that, and they’re usually matched by somebody else. There’s a limited number of choices. Here [in Los Angeles], there’s loads of agencies. Adult pictures. You can have potential contact, if that’s what you want.” Rather than recruit egg vendors herself, she and her business partner help their clients find suitable egg agencies to work with and help them prescreen and narrow down possible matches."
"56" "Megan described for me  the matching process that is typical of California agencies, in which the broker works with clients to select a specific egg provider seen as uniquely appropriate. She says of  her coworker  who  works with clients to select an egg vendor: “[ She ] has worked at a couple different  agencies, and  has been doing this a long while. She’s a donor herself. She actually works with the couples in matching them.  So  she sits with them, and says, ‘Oh, you know, she has your same bone structure.’ Or, ‘Oh, you might want to try this donor.’ ”   According to Megan, some clients will give her agencies photographs of family members and ask them to find vendors who look like them."
"57" "Despite these differences in East and West Coast selection processes, what United States clinics and agencies have in common is the selection itself. That is, no matter whether the clinic selects an anonymous  egg provider  for the client or if the client makes the selection herself, the very act of selection  involves  drawing from a   pool of  pre-screened  women  and then matching a specific  woman  to a specific intended parent , based on the collected biographical data I described in the above section .   The United States  brokers and professionals   I interviewed viewed  this  matching process—choosing a particular  egg  vendor  for a particular client— as  a uniquely American practice ,  superior to the matching process used by   clinics and agencies  in other countries ."
"58" "Fertility industry professionals’ views of their counterparts abroad are shaped by stories that their clients share with them.  For example,  Liz  described a clinic in Spain where she had heard they have an almost assembly-line process for egg donation, with  egg providers  constantly being stimulated.  “You know,” she says, “I was talking with one woman, and she said, basically, they constantly stimulate donors. They just don’t stop.  So  they, you know, and they have however many donors stimulating at the same time, and then the patients just kind of come in and, I don’t think there’s much matching that goes on.”  Notwithstanding this account heard by Liz, a ccording to Spanish law, egg  providers  are as sured  absolute anonymity and confidentiality ,  recipients may not personally select their own  providers ,  and  medical  professionals  are urged to “provide the most similar phenotypic and immunological match to the receptor w oman from all samples available ”   (European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, 2006) . .  Regardless of how egg  transfer  is actually practiced in Spain, the require ments of the law, at least, do  not sound all that different from how Liz’s own program selects  egg  vendor s on behalf of clients, in part by matching phenotype."
"59" "Similarly, Dr. Randolph dismisses  the  protocols that he had heard about in an Italian clinic before egg transfer had been outlawed. According to some of his patients, the clinics would call clients whenever some eggs had become available, regardless of any particular matching process.  This goes against  the culture of California fertility clinics, where the client plays a role in selecting their egg provider and may even meet them.  From his perspective, the  California  method is superior because  “They don’t just take a random  egg  or any egg is okay.”"
"60" "Although both Liz and Dr. Randolph relied upon rumors and hearsay about how Spanish and Italian clinics operated,  it is significant that  fertility industry employees  in the United States hold these perceptions of  Europe an practices  because it influences how they market their own services .  Within the cultural orientation of United States fertility clinics and agencies, where egg providers are recruited, screened, and marketed for their social  and  genetic qualities, it is only logical that brokers would want to ensure that their client are being matched with the “right” eggs, rather than “random” ones."
"61" "RACE AND  THE UNITED STATES GAMETE MARKET"
"62" "Researchers studying gamete  selling  in the United States have shown how particular traits, such as race, are used to  recruit and  select egg and sperm  providers   (Almeling, 2011; Moore, 2007; Roberts, 2011) . This kind  of selection  extends beyond American consumers, enabled by globalization and the ability of  U.S.  clinics and agencies to market the quality of their egg vendors to intended parents worldwide  (Martin, 2014) . The website of Donor Concierge, based in California, has a special page for “International Services,” advertising their ability to help “intended parents from around the world find an egg donor and/or surrogate in the United States to help create their family. … We have access to more U.S. egg donor and surrogate databases than anyone in the world. Donor Concierge is your best bet for finding the donor or surrogate who most closely fits your requirements”  (Donor Concierge, 2013) . The website of a fertility clinic in Florida (another destination for reproduction tourism), lists “Unique benefits for patients from other countries” including the “ability to provide an anonymous egg donor where the patients can view photos and extensive background profiles. Many countries limit the information available to patients. In addition, we have a large pool of egg donors because in  Florida donors can be compensated for their time and efforts”  (Fertility Center & Applied Genetics of Florida, 2013) ."
"63" "The  U.S.  gamete market offers intended parents around the globe access to a large, diverse, and highly curated pool of  eggs  to select from.  An administrator at a Los Angeles clinic informed me that they work with a lot of intended parents flying in from East  Asia, and  have thus established a special relationship with a local egg donor agency that specifically recruits Asian American egg vendors. Another egg broker described recruiting women of specific ethnicities in order to appeal to intended parents of that background. The “constant” recruiting by egg brokers described above enables brokers to offer an ethnically- and phenotypically-diverse pool of gametes."
"64" "The sheer diversity of the United States’ egg market  is  one of its biggest draws , and agencies  such as Donor Concierge  explicitly use this for both recruiting and marketing purposes .  As indicated by the number of Craigslist recruiting posts seeking young women of specific races and ethnicities, matching by race/ethnicity is  prominent  in the selection process, along with physical resemblance.  Liz sees the matching process as a way for the intended parent to “connect” with the  egg  vendor , since  they match not only according to race but also to “shape, size, color, body type, skin tone, and I mean there are just a million little factors, personality , mannerisms, similar interests .”  Megan tells me about different traits that international clients request that she sees as culturally and phenotypically specific: “But specific cultures seem to have different things that they look for that’s kind of the same in each  cultures . Usually when we get East Indian recipients, they’ll say, ‘We don’t want anybody with blue eyes in our family.’ It’s a dead give-away ( laughs ).”"
"65" "Matching by race/ethnicity and by phenotype may be used  as a cover for people wishing to hide their use of an egg  provider , or who want the offspring to more closely resemble the  rest  of the family. Robin  spoke of clients who wanted to pretend—to their child and to themselves—that they did not use another woman’s eggs to conceive.  In countries that  ban anonymous donation, require donor registries, and uphold the right of offspring to know about their genetic parentage , hiding the origin story of children would be much more difficult, if not impossible .  Hiding a child’s origins is not always the motivation for matching by p hysical appearance, obviously, but emphasizing how imperative it is  to match clients with familiar-looking egg providers hints at approximating phenotypical—if not genetic—continuity within a family."
"66" "Embedded in this racial/ethnic matching is the assumption that there is some genetic basis of race and ethnicity   (Roberts, 2011) , or  by a desire for  gametes  that   come from a gene pool similar to  the intended parents’ .  The drive for genetic continuity is not merely an individualized phenomenon, but is bound up with notions of nationhood, culture, race, ethnicity, and religion. In Benedict Anderson’s  (1991)  famous formulation, there is an “imagined” quality to people’s conceptions of themselves as members of nations and other communities, and part of the mythmaking involved in the creation of nationalist sentiments is about the relatedness of its people.  What is not clear is if this desire for race/ethnicity matching is driven by consumer demand or by the  brokers and professionals’  own beliefs. Megan described working at another egg agency where workers were dismayed that an African American woman might select a white egg  provider . “And I’m going, ‘If she wants to, why not? You know, who cares?’”  This type of matching by race or ethnicity may  be an  attempt to approximate finding egg vendors who physically match the intended  parents, yet  embedded in the request is the  very  assumption that a woman of similar race/ethnicity would be a phenotypical , if not genetic,  match."
"67" "American clinics and agencies use their unique practice of matching one egg vendor to one recipient as a competitive advantage in the global marketplace. In addition to their differences in matching vendors with clients, the United States is exceptional in its lack of  federal  regulation of  the buying and selling of gametes .  In  the United States, the only limits on compensation for eggs comes from unenforceable guidelines by the  American Society for Reproductive Medicine ,  whereas  the price of eggs in the United Kingdom are capped by regulatory authorities  (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, 2011a) . In addition, anonymous gamete donation is prohibited in the U.K., contributing to a gamete shortage  (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, 2011b) .  Eggs from  United States   vendor s cost about four to six times as much as eggs in the U.K.,  but  what the intended parents get for those additional dollars is access to a larger, more diverse, and pre-screened  assortment  of potential egg vendors. Because there are no requirements for  gamete  providers  to be tracked in a registry or  enforceable caps on   how much they may be compensated ,  there are many more  gametes available  in the United States for intended parents to choose from than in countries where  gamete  transfer  is highly regulated."
"68" "T he desire for a child (and, by proxy, an egg  vendor ), who resembles or exceeds the intended parents in appearance, educational background, personality, or hobbies, is not unique to Americans. Intended parents come to the United States to work with agencies and clinics that cater to these desires for a particular kind of child/ vendor —desires that many government and clinic policies regarding  third-party egg transfer  abroad make difficult to fulfill. Moreover, the United States’ heterogeneous population is advantageous for those seeking a specific race/ethnicity or physical appearance."
"69" "The generally laissez-faire attitude of the United States federal government towards reproductive technologies and the fertility industry  benefits  intended parents worldwide who seek selective technologies to increase their chances of having (or avoiding having) children with particular genetic qualities or traits   (Martin, 2015) . As described above, it is standard practice in the United States to use selective criteria to recruit, screen, and match egg  vendor s. Most  informants did not verbalize any major problem or concern with this practice, and in fact saw the American way of matching  egg  vendor s with clients as superior to how egg  transfer  functions elsewhere."
"70" "CONCLUSION:  SELLING   EGGS ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET"
"71" "Egg transfer in the United States functions not only as an assistive technology, but as a selective one.  Before  in vitro fertilization  was even invented, historian Mark Haller  (1963, p. 189)  wrote of the ways in which advances in the study of genetics was leading to a revived interest in eugenics: “[While]  eugenists  generally recognize that their movement currently has only minor influence and importance, they look forward to the day when man can, by bringing his genetic future under control, do much to make human life healthier and happier.” It is not quite accurate to state that eugenics as it was practiced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is being revived in the practice of egg transfer today. Unlike eugenics, egg transfer is not compulsory, nor is it being enforced by the state. As a quite expensive infertility treatment, egg transfer is available only to the few who can afford it, and thus its material consequences are not widespread."
"72" "Yet, as a selective technology, egg transfer  reinforces   genetic determinist ideas about  the  production of  children with desirable and superior qualities while screening out less than desirable traits . The recruiting, screening, marketing, and matching process used by brokers is based on their ideas about  what constitutes  fitness, desirability, and marketability. The  technology  becomes  both the instrument and justification for the practice.  By assessing the qualities of the prospective genetic parent (i.e. the egg  provider ), brokers translate this information into a biographical tool for intended parents  who want to determine, predict, or  influence  their future offspring’s race/ethnicity,  appearance, temperament, abilities, and behavior."
"73" "While the buying and selling of eggs, and the associated selective  practices  that attend these commercial transactions ,  is perfectly legal in the United States, other nations enforce much more regulation (if not outright prohibitions) on  commercial  egg transfer.   Intended parents whose desires align with U.S. fertility industry practices may travel to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or elsewhere  to find brokers and clinics that will meet their  reproductive  needs . As  long as the  policies in the United States  remain favorable towards technologies that other countries ban or highly regulate,  New York and California will continue to be  destination s  for intended parents wanting to wager on selecti ve technologies.  Designing one’s own children  is still merely science fiction, but t he way that  brokers and professionals  recruit, screen, and match egg vendors with intended parents supports, rather than quells, the idea that the superior qualities of their egg vendors are transmissible—and worth paying a hefty fee for."
