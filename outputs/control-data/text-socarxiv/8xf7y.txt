Traditionally the neglected ‘Cinderella’ service of the Indian armed forces, the Indian Navy is
in the midst of a modernization programme that has attracted international concern from
commentators who worry that this might pose a risk to stability in the Indian Ocean or
presage a naval arms race in Asia.1 This chapter attempts to understand what is driving this
uncharacteristic focus on the Navy, concentrating on developments in the 20-year period
since the end of the Cold War (1991–2011). The analysis proceeds in two parts. The first
section examines several different measures, including number of ships, aggregate tonnage,
number of missile cells and budgetary allocation to understand the trajectory of the Indian
Navy over the past 20 years. Section two examines three oft-cited justifications for naval
expansion – defence against hostile maritime powers, the cultivation of power projection
capability to further India’s political interests, and the protection of trade – in relation to the
fleet’s actual platform acquisitions to determine their relative importance in driving naval
development.
The available data suggests that the primary mission driving naval modernization is
sea-lane security, with the development of ‘softer’ aspects of power projection capability
receiving some support, while the need to deter hostile maritime powers does little to explain
India’s recent naval modernization. This focus on enhancing India’s ability to provide

regional ‘public goods,’ such as sea-lane security and humanitarian response, strongly
suggests that this growing naval strength can emerge as a net positive for the region. [19]

Is the Indian Navy Growing?
Despite the international attention given to the Indian Navy’s recent acquisitions, some
observers argue the fleet is actually withdrawing platforms faster than it is adding them.2 In an
effort to clarify this situation, three different measures are used to judge developments in the
fleet since 1991: number of ships, size of ships and the number of missile cells per ship. To
understand whether this observed naval modernization is evidence of a determined turn to the
sea on the part of the Indian armed forces, a fourth measure, relative budget share, is also
examined. Collectively, these measures suggest the Navy is acquiring significantly more
advanced platforms, while the overall number of ships is relatively static, but this does not
indicate a reprioritization of the Navy vis-à-vis the other armed forces.
The most obvious way to measure growth is to count the number of ships in the fleet.
In terms of major [20]platforms – submarines, principal surface combatants (aircraft carriers,
destroyers and frigates) and amphibious ships – the Indian Navy has slightly contracted over
the last 20 years. The fleet possessed 51 major vessels in 1991, but only 50 such ships today.3
During this period, the Navy lost submarines, frigates and aircraft carriers, while gaining
destroyers and amphibious warships. [21]

Since quality matters as well as quantity, the number of ships alone is not a sufficient measure
of the health of a fleet. In the absence of a detailed analysis of the weapons, radars and

propulsion systems of individual platforms, the full-load displacement of a ship can be used
as a crude proxy for its capability.4 The aggregate displacement of the fleet was nearly 30 per
cent greater in 2011 (217,426 tons) than 1991 (167,657 tons), despite the lack of growth in the
numbers of major platforms, a trend that was most pronounced with respect to frigates and
amphibious craft.5

A second measure of the quality of Indian naval vessels is their number of missile cells
carrying anti-ship cruise missiles, land-attack cruise missiles, anti-submarine rockets, or
surface-to-air-missiles with a range greater than 8.6 nautical miles.6 By this measure, the
quality of the fleet has increased significantly. In 1991, the Navy’s warships possessed a total
72 missile cells: in 2011, it carried 402 – an increase in striking power, air defence and antisubmarine capability of more than five-and-a-half times, in addition to the improvements in
range and accuracy of modern systems.
With the quality of the modern vessels improving moderately as measured by aggregate
tonnage and drastically with respect to number of missile cells, it appears that the Navy has
sought increasingly capable modern platforms, while being less concerned with the overall
size of its fleet. To put Indian developments into perspective, as Table 2.2 indicates, among
other major Asian navies, China and Australia are both expanding their fleets and adding
more capable platforms (as measured by aggregate tonnage), the South Koreans are
expanding their numbers significantly while holding their capability steady, and the Japanese
are adding more capable platforms while shrinking the overall size of their fleet.

Is this modernization of the Indian fleet evidence of a desire to emerge as a major maritime
power? In nominal terms, the Indian Navy’s budget has gone from Rs 2,090.78 crore ($468
million) in 1991 to Rs 21,467.51 crore ($4.8 billion) in 2011, a growth of more than 1,000 per

cent (Figure 2.2).7 Moreover, naval spending grew at a slightly faster average annual rate
(12.3 per cent) than the [22] overall defence budget (11.5 per cent). Despite this tenfold
increase in nominal naval spending, in comparison to the budgetary allocations of the Army
and the Air Force (Figure 2.3), the Navy clearly remains the third service. The Navy’s relative
share of the defence budget increased from a low of 11.5 per cent in 1992–93 [24] to a high of
18.9 per cent in 2006–2007 before regressing to 14.7 per cent by 2010–11 – a budget share it
previously held in 1999–2000. This is far short of the sustained 20 per cent share of defence
spending some overly optimistic observers believed that the Navy could achieve, let alone the
30 per cent share recommended by the Standing Committee on Defence in 1998.8 It has
traditionally been difficult for the Navy to justify allocating scarce defence resources to its
capital-intensive fleet given the country’s outstanding territorial disputes with both Pakistan
and China. As numerous land powers throughout history have found, the resources necessary
to become a major maritime power are unlikely to be available as long as India continues to
require a large army to protect its territorial integrity.9

Drivers of Indian Naval Development
What is driving the development of the Indian Navy described in the previous section? The
justifications for a robust fleet put forth by naval proponents have remained relatively static
despite changing geopolitical circumstances in the six decades since Independence.10 The
three principal arguments are the need to:
1. Prevent a hostile power from encroaching on the country’s expansive coastline
and maritime areas of interests.
2. Project power in a manner fitting the country’s desired regional or global role.
3. Safeguard the sea lanes which carry India’s trade and energy supplies.
To assess the factor most salient in driving naval modernization, each justification will first be
compared to the actual risks India faces. Second, the Navy’s acquisition patterns over the past
two decades will be examined to see if they demonstrate [25] preparation for that mission.
Though subject to time lags, platform acquisition can provide a more concrete indication of a
navy’s priorities since it is a costlier signal of future intentions than the statements of senior
policy-makers or proclamations made in service doctrinal publications.11 While there is a
degree of fungibility among naval platforms, certain vessel types are better suited for some
missions than others: a navy configured to deny access to a hostile power, for example, will

look different from one primarily designed to influence events on land from the sea.12 Thus,
by examining the specific mix of vessels in the fleet and the missions they are optimally
configured to carry out, it is possible to make a qualified judgement about the Indian Navy’s
priorities.
Assessment of both vulnerability and platform acquisition suggests concerns about
securing the country’s sea lanes is the primary factor driving India’s naval development.
Growth in amphibious lift provides some evidence that power projection is a factor of
interest; however, the lack of assets to facilitate operations in hostile littoral environments
indicates this capability is focused on ‘softer’ missions such as non-combatant evacuation and
humanitarian response. The least evidence exists to support the idea that concerns about
extra-regional powers is the driving factor, as evidenced by the sorry state of India’s
submarine fleet.

Denying Hostile Maritime Powers
The desire to defend the country’s sphere of influence from hostile powers is one factor
potentially driving Indian naval modernization.13 India possesses nearly 4,800 miles of
coastline and a massive 2.54 million square mile exclusive economic zone that constitutes
nearly 10 per cent of the Indian Ocean. American naval analysts have argued that the core of
India’s maritime strategy is to defend the entire Indian Ocean as the country’s ‘rightful and
exclusive sphere of interest’.14 Indeed, ‘the arc from [26] the Persian Gulf to the Straits of

Malacca’ is identified by the Indian Navy’s 2004 Maritime Doctrine defined as ‘a legitimate
area of interest …’.15
Concerns about extra-regional maritime actors in the Indian Ocean precede
Independence, with both Indian scholars and politicians linking the country’s naval weakness
in the sixteenth century to its subsequent conquest by colonial powers.16 More recently, the
Nixon Administration’s gunboat diplomacy during the 1971 Bangladesh War – dispatching
the USS Enterprise task force to the Bay of Bengal to signal tacit support for Pakistan – has,
according to one Indian scholar, ‘seeped into India’s cultural memory – even among those
who know nothing of the sea’.17 Concern that extra-regional powers would seek to establish a
lasting presence in the Indian Ocean would appear to be particularly acute today since the
Navy’s 2004 maritime doctrine predicts, all ‘major powers of this century will seek a toehold
in the [Indian Ocean Region]’.18 In particular, the Navy’s maritime strategy gives explicit
attention to the Chinese navy’s actions in the Indian Ocean.19 Beijing’s efforts to establish a
network of ports and partnerships with countries in the littoral region – including several
nations that have traditionally been hostile to India – have alarmed many in India’s strategic
community.20 As a result, some scholars have suggested that ‘it is India’s fears and

perceptions of the growing naval prowess of China in the Indian Ocean that is driving Indian
naval posture’.21 [27]
Do extra-regional maritime powers pose a sufficient threat to drive India’s naval
modernization programme? While India’s Independence may have historically been linked to
sea control, it hyperbole to advance that argument today. A hostile maritime power seeking to
invade India from the sea would have to withstand the power of the Indian Air Force in their
approach to the shore. Any forces surviving this initial bombardment would then find that
India’s coastline has few landing zones adjacent to strategic objectives that would make an
amphibious assault worthwhile.22 Although, as the 2008 attacks on Mumbai demonstrated, the
possibility of a terrorist group infiltrating India by sea is real, the appropriate responses to this
threat are inshore patrol craft and the creation of specialized coast guard units to protect
India’s ports and coastline, not blue-water warships. Although a cause for concern during the
Cold War, the burgeoning Indo-American strategic partnership means that the U.S. Navy is
now a welcome sight in the Indian Ocean. With respect to China, over the last 15 years,
senior Chinese military personnel have suggested that they don’t recognize the Indian Ocean
as India’s exclusive domain.23 However, with 75 per cent of its surface vessels considered
obsolete and only possessing a limited power projection capability, the Chinese navy is
configured to prevent US intervention in a crisis involving Taiwan, not projecting power

abroad.24 There would have to be a significantly favourable shift in the naval balance in East
Asia before Beijing could seriously entertain a sustained presence in the Indian Ocean.
Turning to the configuration of the Indian fleet, the development of a robust sea-denial
capability would provide evidence that concern about extra-regional actors was driving naval
modernization. Since the early 1900s, ‘the weapon of choice’ for sea-denial missions has been
the submarine.25 This is particularly true in the Indian Ocean where the peculiar underwater
topography, salinity and thermoclines all hinder the ability of sonar to detect submarines and
other underwater objects. Therefore, a significant modernization of India’s submarine fleet
would provide the most apparent evidence of a focus on sea-denial.
In 1991 the Indian Navy possessed seven obsolete Russian Foxtrot (INS: Vela/Kalvari)
class diesel-electric submarines, two German HDW 209s [28] (INS: Shishumar), and eight
modern Russian-built Kilo (INS: Sindhughosh) class boats, the last of which was one of the
quietest diesel submarines in the world. In the ensuing two decades, the submarine fleet has
undergone a steady decline. The fleet did add a pair each of HDW 209s and Kilos while seven
of the older Kilos were upgraded to the Type 636 standard which equipped them with modern
fire control systems, advanced torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles. Meanwhile, all but one
of the Foxtrots were removed from service and the majority of the remaining submarines
approached the end of their operational life. By October 2009, the Comptroller and Auditor
General estimated that the submarine fleet’s operational readiness rate had fallen below 50
per cent, a shortcoming exacerbated by the fact that the Navy only possessed ⅔ of the number
of submarines envisioned by planners in the 1980s.26

The lethargic pace with which the MoD has pursued new submarines demonstrates the
relative lack of interest in the submarine fleet. A contract for six French-designed Scorpene
subs was only signed in 2005, at a time when five of the seven Foxtrots had already been
withdrawn from service. The first of these Scorpenes was not even scheduled to be delivered
until 2012, which would be a dozen years since the most recent submarine entered the fleet.
With the inevitable delays in procurement programmes, however, by the time the first
Scorpene is actually inducted in the middle of the decade, it has been estimated that India will
only have between five and nine operational submarines left. Even with the most optimistic
assumptions, this will fall significantly short of the minimum of 18 conventional submarines
believed necessary to effectively deter hostile maritime powers.27
Despite the obvious fact that ‘India is in dire need of modern submarines’, there has
been no attempt to fill the gap through a short-term lease or other rapid acquisition
programme.28 Instead, a tender for six additional submarines was issued in 2010, which will
not even be signed before 2012–13.29 The priority given to developing the capacity of
government shipyards has meant that the Navy’s request to speed delivery of these six
additional submarines by building them in private shipyards—rather than the already
overburdened state-owned Mazagon Docks—was overruled.30
Nothing about the state of India’s submarine fleet suggests developing an anti-access
capability to deter extra-regional powers is a prime concern. Nor would [29] the submarine
capability that the Navy is projected to possess in the 2015–20 timeframe be sufficient to
prevent an extra-regional power from establishing a presence in the region. Thus we cannot
give significant weight to the idea that Indian naval modernization is chiefly driven by

perceived threats to the homeland posed by hostile maritime powers. Fortunately, India has
friendly relations with the most powerful extra-regional navy in the Indian Ocean, the United
States, while the potential naval challenge from China appears many years off.

Power Projection for Great Power Status
The desire to gain a maritime power projection capability as a marker of great power status is
a second factor that has been posited to drive Indian naval modernization. With the ability to
project military power abroad having been identified as a core characteristic of a great power,
a rising state such as India could have ample reason to want to enhance its military power
projection capabilities.31 In this vein, scholars such as Ashley Tellis believe that ‘India’s rise
to power will remain incomplete until it acquires, and develops, the capacity to effectively
utilize the full panoply of military power’.32

policy orientation all but precludes projection of military power beyond its territory, this ignores the fact that India
has not hesitated to ‘sort out’ its neighbours when New Delhi felt that its interests were threatened. Moreover, it
fails to appreciate that military power projection has both hard and soft power aspects. Thus, when called upon to
do so by national interest, the Indian military has undertaken armed intervention in the Maldives; compulsion
operations in Sri Lanka; and showed the flag in the South China Sea as well as non-combatant evacuation
operations in Lebanon and humanitarian relief missions in Southeast Asia. For an extended discussion, see Walter

Observing that, since 1500, the leading maritime powers have been the leading powers
in the world, George Modelski and William Thompson argue that maritime power – vice
land-power or airpower – is what determines great power [30] status.33 From an early age the
Indian Navy recognized the link between maritime power and international status: its initial
1947 expansion plan identified naval development as a means of achieving ‘a position of preeminence and leadership among the nations of South-East Asia’.34 In this vein, some
contemporary analysts believe ‘the general posture of the [Indian Navy] is power projection,
an aspiration pushed hard by the Navy itself, but endorsed in principal by governments of all
political persuasion, and enthusiastically supported by the population at large’.35 The Navy’s
2007 maritime strategy would appear to sanction this view as it repeatedly mentions the need
to ‘project power’ to support the country’s foreign policy objectives and achieve its national
aims.36
Since humans live on land, not on the sea, however, the projection of maritime power
must ultimately have an impact onshore. As a result, it has been suggested India’s naval
modernization is driven by a particular desire to boost its ability to decisively influence
military operations on land.37 Towards that end, in 2008, then-Chief of Naval Staff Admiral
Sureesh Mehta declared that his goal for 2020 was a navy that would be ‘capable of
influencing the outcome of land battles and performing a constabulary role in the Indian
Ocean region’.38

Control of the sea, which is the ability to operate ‘with a high degree of freedom in a
sea or ocean area … for a limited period of time’, is a fundamental prerequisite for both
power projection and the protection of sea lanes (the latter of which is discussed in the
subsequent section.)39 However, sea control alone is not sufficient for the more demanding
mission of maritime power projection onshore, which can take two general forms: amphibious
assault by ground troops and strikes by carrier aircraft and cruise missiles. Although the
precision and reach of naval aircraft and cruise missiles makes them potent tools, both
scholars of naval strategy such as Geoffrey Till and international relations theorists like John
Mearsheimer contend that amphibious operations remain ‘the main subset of maritime power
projection’.40 In contrast, bombardment with missions or carrier aircraft are derided as
‘pinprick [31] warfare’ that ‘has little effect on the target state’.41 Thus, a concrete indication
that power projection was driving India’s naval development would be a significant
expansion in amphibious capability, namely the acquisition of platforms that can transport a
significant number of troops overseas.42 A secondary indication would be the cultivation of
the ability to carry out air and missile strikes on shore.
Twenty years ago the Navy could transport 1,800 men and 55 tanks with a single
Magar class landing ship tank (LST) and eight Kumbhir class (Polish: Polnocy variant)
medium landing ships (LSM). In 2011, the Navy’s amphibious complement has the notional
ability to move a brigade-sized force of 4,300 men, 100 tanks and several dozen armoured
vehicles. In addition to the 19,000-ton landing platform dock INS Jalashwa (US: Austin
class), which is the second-largest ship in the fleet and can transport a thousand soldiers by
itself, the Navy possesses five Magar and Shardul class LSTs and five remaining Kumbhir
LSMs.

The Navy has employed this expanded capability in a number of high-profile
humanitarian response and non-combatant evacuation operations that have attracted
worldwide attention. Following the 2004 Asian tsunami, the Indian Navy mobilized 32 ships
and over 20,000 naval personnel to evacuate casualties, as well as provide emergency sources
of power and water to the peoples of Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Indonesia, Thailand and
Malaysia. Two years later, during Operation Sukoon, the Navy evacuated 2,280 Indian, Sri
Lankan and Nepalese civilians from Lebanon ahead of the 2006 Israeli-Hizbollah War. These
operations have burnished India’s credentials as a net provider of security and enhanced its
regional reputation in line with the predictions of the analysts cited above. Consequently, in
December 2010, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved the Navy’s plan to acquire four
additional LPDs of a similar size as the Jalashwa; however, given the chequered history of
Indian naval construction, it could be the mid 2020s before they actually come into service.43
Amphibious ships are sufficient for softer power projection missions such as
responding to humanitarian crises and evacuating non-combatants from conflict zones.44
However, to operate in hostile littoral waters, these platforms would need support from
vessels with robust anti-submarine and anti-air capabilities. There should be evidence of a
focused effort to acquire these facilitating capabilities if the projection of hard military power
were in fact a key goal of the Navy. Although the Navy possesses modern sonar of an
international standard, its principal anti-submarine warfare (ASW) surface vessels are far too
large to effectively hunt [32] submarines in littoral waters.45 Similarly, air defence is

43

Twenty years elapsed between the start of design for the Delhi-class destroyers and the commissioning of the

first platform. The interval was 13 years for the Shivalik-class frigate.

For a discussion of ideal platforms for littoral ASW, see Milan Vego, ‘Patrolling the Deep’, Armed Forces

Journal, September 2008. The Navy does have plans to acquire ASW corvettes of the Kamorta-class, which would
be appreciated for this mission; however the first of these will not be commissioned until mid 2012.

significantly more challenging close to shore than in the open ocean.46 Possessing a moderate
area air-defence capability, India’s surface fleet would have difficulty screening a task force
from hostile ground-based aircraft. Not only are ground-based aircraft able to marshal greater
numbers close to shore than they could at sea, the clutter of land creates backscatter which
affects radar returns, impeding detection rates of hostile aircraft by air-defence radars. One of
India’s aircraft carriers could theoretically take up this mission; however, only 11 of the
Navy’s 30 Mk. 51 Sea Harrier fighters remain in service. Moreover, as of April 2012, the
naval version of the domestically designed Tejas lightweight fighter, which is supposed to
replace the Harriers for air-defence missions, has only just made its initial test flight.
With respect to the second aspect of maritime power projection, the Navy has not
demonstrated a concerted effort to acquire a robust ability to undertake strikes against groundbased targets with either naval aircraft or cruise missiles. Given the common association of
aircraft carriers with power projection, the steady deterioration of India’s aircraft carrier
capability since 1991 is telling. Having possessed two light fleet carriers in 1991, the INS
Vikrant (UK: Majestic) was decommissioned in 1997, and the 58-year-old Viraat (UK:
Centaur), is on its last legs having already undergone four mid-service refits to extend its
lifespan. The Navy could find itself without a carrier for several years should induction of the
44,500-ton, Russian-built INS Vikramaditya (RU: Kiev) – which is expected to join the fleet
at the end of 2012 – or the domestically built 40,000-ton ‘new’ Vikrant (Project 71) –
currently under construction in Cochin – be delayed beyond the middle of the decade.
The pace and means of India’s aircraft carrier acquisition does not demonstrate a rush
to expand its carrier capability. Having possessed only a single operational carrier since 1997,
the deal to purchase the Vikramaditya was not signed until seven years after the
decommissioning of the original Vikrant. Moreover, the Vikramaditya was not even
scheduled to be delivered until 2008, the time that the Viraat itself was supposed to be
withdrawn from service. The decision to opt for indigenous construction of the both the new

Vikrant and a third carrier – when India’s domestic shipyards have never before built ships of
that size – suggests India places a higher priority on enhancing domestic shipbuilding
capacity than immediately acquiring naval airpower projection capability.
The limited strike capability of the actual aircraft complement of India’s forthcoming
carriers also suggests that hard power projection ashore is not a priority. Each new carrier will
carry only 12–16 fighters, meaning that even operating in tandem, two Indian carriers would
produce less striking power than the French carrier Charles de Gaulle and nowhere near that
of a single US super [33] carrier. American naval analysts have judged that, ‘even armed with
precision-guided munitions, a contingent of this size could sustain only a modest land
bombardment, and only for a modest time’.47 If naval strike operations were a serious focus
for the Navy, a robust airborne early warning (AEW) capability would be crucial for
protecting both the carrier and its aircraft when operating close to a hostile shore. However,
Indian naval officials have recently suggested that the acquisition of fixed-wing AEW assets
for the new carriers is not a priority.48
Strikes with cruise missiles face a similar range constraint as carrier aircraft. The 156
nmi range supersonic BrahMos cruise missile is the Indian Navy’s premier surface-strike
weapon. Although the BrahMos is three times faster than the US Tomahawk cruise missile,
with a top speed of Mach 2.5, it has only one-tenth the range. The same shortcoming also
affects the Russian-designed 3M-54 Klub cruise missile (148 nmi range) in service with the
Indian Navy. Even against a state with a modest anti-access capability, the relatively short
range of these missiles would render surface-launched cruise missile strikes a risky
proposition. A subsonic cruise missile with a range of 540 nmi, is currently being developed
by India’s Defence Research and Development Organization; however, test flights of the

17

missile have been repeatedly delayed and are not expected to occur until late 2012 at the
earliest.49
There is mixed evidence to support the idea that power projection is India’s primary
naval concern. Despite doubling its amphibious lift capability, the Navy has not acquired new
amphibious platforms at a particularly rapid pace. Between 2007 and 2009 the Jalashwa and
three Shardul class LSTs were acquired; however, prior to that, the only acquisition was a
single Magar LST in 1997. Consequently, a number of India’s amphibious ships – including
the second-hand Jalashwa which was originally launched in 1968 – are quite old. Moreover,
the land-attack capability India is acquiring is poorly suited to carry out strikes against states
with even a rudimentary anti-access capability. This suggests that rather than the projection of
hard maritime power abroad a focus on the ‘softer’ aspects of power projection, such as the
disaster relief and non-combatant evacuation missions that have won the Navy international
praise in the past, are a focus of naval development.

Securing Shipping
The imperatives of protecting India’s trade and energy lifelines is a third factor posited to
motivate naval development. As ships transit the open ocean, which Mahan described as ‘a
great highway … over which men may pass in all directions’, they follow ‘some well-worn
paths’ known as trade routes in a previous age and [34] sea lines of communication (SLOCs)
today.50 The sea remains the primary medium for transporting goods worldwide, which raises
concerns for trading nations that vital sea lanes could be disturbed by piracy, war or the
actions of a hostile power.
Indian naval enthusiasts have long argued that ‘the essential dependence of [India’s]
trade on maritime traffic …’ means ‘… the economic life of India will be completely at the

mercy of the power which controls the seas’.51 In this vein, the Navy’s early leaders believed
their primary purpose was ‘the protection of India’s shipping and lines of communication’.52
Today roughly 90 per cent of India’s trade by volume and 77 per cent by value is
seaborne, and of the country’s top 10 trading partners only one shares a border with India.53
Since the economic reforms initiated in 1991, the importance of international trade to the
Indian economy has increased appreciably. India’s import and export of merchandise, in
current dollars, was 14 times larger in 2010 than it was in 1991, while its trade-to-GDP ratio
has climbed from 17.1 per cent in 1991 to 43.6 per cent in 2009.54 Physically situated adjacent
to the primary maritime trade routes crossing the Indian Ocean, India’s Maritime Strategy
notes that ‘being the major maritime power in the [Indian Ocean region], a large part of the
responsibility for ensuring the safety of international shipping lanes devolves upon the Indian
Navy’.55
The significance of the goods trade for the Indian economy is trumped by the need to
guarantee adequate energy resources for sustained economic growth. India’s oil consumption
is expected to double present day consumption by 2025 and by some estimates India is
expected to become the world’s third largest energy consumer by 2030.56 As the Navy’s
Maritime Strategy recognizes, ‘India’s entire development process depends on the availability

of energy resources’.57 Imports [35] are expected to account for 80 per cent of the India’s
energy needs by the first quarter of the century.58 With Saudi Arabia (18 per cent), Iran (16
per cent), Kuwait (10 per cent) and Iraq (9 per cent) emerging as India’s principal sources of
foreign oil, nearly 65 per cent of its energy comes from the Persian Gulf.59 The Navy’s
Maritime Strategy explicitly notes that protecting the country’s oil and gas supply lines ‘will
remain a primary responsibility of the Indian Navy’.60
The ability to exert sea control along the entire distance of India’s primary sea lanes is
a prerequisite for securing the country’s trade and energy flows.61 This means not only in the
northern Indian Ocean, but as far as the Strait of Hormuz to the west and the Straits of
Malacca to the east. The capacity to exercise control over the surface, air and subsurface of a
given area is a prerequisite for protecting sea lanes in the open ocean against a hostile naval
power. A fleet optimized to guard SLOCs will have a robust anti-surface warfare capability
including advanced maritime surveillance and precision-strike capability; open ocean ASW
capability; and area air defence provided by modern destroyers or aircraft carriers.62
At the end of the Cold War, the Indian Navy possessed two light fleet carriers, five
Rajput class (RU: Kashin II variant) guided-missile destroyers and a dozen frigates of various
classes. The destroyers were equipped for anti-aircraft roles, with SA-N-1 surface-to-air

missiles providing local area air defence with a range of 19 nmi. The Navy’s destroyers and
frigates all possessed modest anti-submarine warfare capabilities in the form [36] of basic
hull-mounted sonar systems torpedo tubes, anti-submarine rocket launchers, and a total of 11
embarked ASW helicopters. The principal anti-surface weapon aboard these ships was the 37
nmi ranged Russian SS-N-2C ‘Styx’ missile.
Over the past two decades the quality of the surface fleet has improved in key areas.
The three Delhi class guided-missile destroyers, commissioned in the late 1990s, are the
largest indigenously designed and built vessels in the Indian Navy with a displacement 25 per
cent greater than the Rajput series. During the same period, the Navy has added three new
classes of frigate, the Brahmaputra, Talwar (RU: Krivak III) and Shivalik – the last of which
are nearly the size of the Delhi class destroyers. Anti-surface capability on these new
platforms come in the form of the 70 nmi SS-N-25 ‘Switchblade’ anti-ship missile – which is
equivalent to the US Navy’s Harpoon Block 1C – as well as the supersonic BrahMos. In the
ASW realm, the deployment of modern towed array sonar provides an ASW capability that is
significantly better than the old hull-mounted panoramic sonar. Moreover, the surface fleet’s
combined complement of embarked ASW helicopters has tripled over the past two decades as
virtually every destroyer and frigate now carries one or more Sea King, Druv or Helix ASW
helicopter. The picture is not quite as bright in the air-defence realm where the Delhi class’s
SA-N-7 Gadfly – one of the most effective intermediate-range ship-to-air missiles in use
today – provides local area air defence for the fleet to a range of 17 nmi. The Talwar frigates
are equipped with a slightly more modern surface-to-air missiles than the Delhi destroyers,
which with a range of 24 nmi provide a moderate level of fleet air-defence capability that is a
qualitative step up from the Navy’s capability in 1991. However, these systems contrast
unfavourably with the 80 nmi ranged SA-N-20 SAMs on the Chinese Luzhou class destroyer
or the 100 nmi extended-range standard missile employed by the United States Navy.
In light of the twin observations that carrier capabilities experience increasing marginal
returns with respect to size and that 50,000 tons is the cross-over point where carrier-based
aviation is cheaper than land-based counterparts, India’s decision to opt for medium-sized

21

(40,000 ton) carriers is suggestive.63 These ships’ expected complement of Mig-29K and the
HAL Tejas fighters can provide area air defence for a naval task force, but, as previously
noted, would not have significant strike capability against land-based targets. Progression
from light fleet carriers to medium-sized ones, rather than jumping directly to a 60,000+ ton
platform as the Chinese are attempting to do, is a linear step in line with India’s growing
domestic technology base; however, it is also suggestive of the Navy’s priorities that these
medium-sized carriers are more suited for sea-lane protection that power projection.
In contrast to the other two factors, there is the most evidence to support the idea that
sea-lane security is driving India’s maritime development. In comparison to the ‘threats’
posed by extra-regional navies or the need to project naval power to signal great power status,
the fact that the Navy’s surface fleet has received the bulk of the attention vis-à-vis the
submarine and amphibious fleets over the past two decades suggests that the vulnerability of
India’s overseas trade and energy supplies are the most salient needs for India’s politicalmilitary leadership to address. The fleet’s complement of destroyers and frigates has seen a
host of new designs, some of which exhibit significant upgrade in capability from their
predecessors. Anti-surface warfare capability demonstrates the most robust improvement;
however, [37] the advance in the fleet’s area air defence is also an important improvement,
albeit far from the best in the world.

Bureaucratic Politics?
Given this chapter’s focus on external factors driving naval procurement decisions, before
concluding it is reasonable to ask whether this behaviour is better explained by bureaucratic

63

For example, a 50,000-ton carrier can embark almost twice as many aircraft as a 40,000-ton carrier. ‘New

Carriers’, The Naval Review, L(4) (October 1962): 380; for the importance of the 50,000-ton threshold, see Ashley
Tellis, ‘Aircraft Carriers and the Indian Navy: Assessing the Present, Discerning the Future’, Journal of Strategic
Studies, 10(2) (1987): 143–4.

22

politics either within the Navy or the armed forces more broadly?64 A comprehensive answer
to this question is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is possible briefly to explore these
two issues. Since each of the services develops their procurement and acquisition plans in
isolation, the natural starting point would be the intra-service politics of the Indian Navy. It
has been suggested, for example, that in the US Navy dominant communities such as carrier
aviation and attack submarines garner a disproportionate share of appointments of officers at
the highest levels and resources for their own projects at the expense of lower prestige
communities.65 Thus, overall naval plans may be a reflection of the desires of these powerful
sub-components rather than the rational preferences of the organization as a whole. In the
Indian Navy, the dominant community is the executive branch. Unlike engineering and
electrical officers, only officers from the executive branch can exercise command of ships,
submarines and aircraft, and therefore have any chance of achieving the highest ranks in the
Navy. One result of this configuration is that the individual identities of officers as aviators or
submariners do not arouse the same parochial feelings about their platform community that
they might in other navies. Moreover, with the leadership of the Navy at the highest levels
chosen solely on the basis of seniority (age), it would be very difficult for a particular
community to ensure its prolonged dominance of the organization as a whole. Indeed, during
the 20-year period covered by this study, the Indian Navy has been variously led by aviators,
communications specialists, amphibious warfare officers and submariners, among others.
Thus, there is reason to believe that intra-service politics has less of an impact in shaping
service priorities than might be the case in other navies.

64

Kanter, Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 2007).

Disconﬁrming Findings from the Case of the U.S. Navy’, World Politics, 47(1) (1994): 1–41.

23

With respect to the impact of inter-service politics on acquisition plans, the situation is
somewhat similar.66 There is no doubt that inter-service politics exist [38] in the Indian
military, as in all militaries.67 However, it is not clear that it plays a major role in shaping
acquisition plans; indeed, a major critique of Indian defence acquisitions is that each of the
services develops its plans in isolation.68 Rather than pitting the three services against each
other, an environment of expanding defence budgets appears to have led the heads of the three
services to enter into a tacit agreement not to stand in the way of each other’s priorities when
formulating an integrated acquisition plan for the armed forces. According to a former
Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Arun Prakash, ‘commenting on the
acquisition plan of the other services was considered taboo and, as a result, the integrated plan
was a bundle of all of our plans’.69 As a result, it falls to the civil servants of the Ministry of
Defence to prioritize the services’ procurement plans and undertake major procurement
decisions.70 This system has not resulted in effective integration of service strategies;
however, it is not clear that it has resulted in inter-service competition to the point where it
plays a key role in driving naval acquisition decisions. Thus, while intra- and inter-service
politics undoubtedly affects the Navy’s acquisition decisions on some level, it is more fruitful
to explore the external pressures driving decision-making about the fleet than the internal
ones.

Conclusion
Modernizing, but not growing, is the best way to describe developments in the Indian Navy
since 1991. Although, the pace of this modernization does not suggest significant pressure to
quickly improve naval capabilities, the fleet of 2011 is significantly more capable it was in
1991. A review of both the risks faced by India and the acquisition patterns of the Navy
suggests modernization is being driven primarily by the desire to secure the country’s sea
lanes to protect the flow of trade goods and energy resources. Some evidence suggests that
the desire to enhance maritime power projection capability is also a motivating factor;
however, given the modest pace of amphibious platform acquisition and the lack of
supporting assets to facilitate operations in hostile littorals, the focus appears to be on the
softer aspects of power projection rather than on the meaningful projection of hard military
power ashore. Finally, there is very little support for the idea that concern about extraregional navies is driving Indian naval modernization as evidenced by the Navy’s relative
neglect of its submarine fleet.
Together, the ability to protect sea lanes and project soft maritime power across the
region suggests that India is primarily focused on providing public goods that [39] can benefit
all nations of the region in a manner befitting a regional hegemon.71 Like any pattern of
behaviour, the trends exhibited over the past 20 years are not immune to exogenous shocks.
For example, settlement of India’s border disputes with Pakistan and China could finally
allow the Navy the defence resources necessary to develop a true blue-water power projection
fleet. Conversely, if China were to unexpectedly consolidate its maritime position in East
Asia in a manner that allows it to redirect significant naval assets towards the Indian Ocean –
which requires resolving the Taiwan issue and establishing of a favourable naval balance visà-vis Japan and the US – the Indian Navy may be compelled to focus its energies on

developments, however, the Indian Navy’s medium-term priority will probably continue to be
the development of a SLOC-defence, sea-control capability. [40]
