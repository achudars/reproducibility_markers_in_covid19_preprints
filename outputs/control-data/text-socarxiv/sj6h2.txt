Abstract
This article is about the metamorphoses of aggregate Indian wealth over fifteen politically
transformative decades. Based on a comprehensive new database, I find that wealth-income
ratios have fluctuated by large margins in the twentieth century. In emerging India of the twenty
first century, wealth is steadily approaching the same disproportionate size (relative to national
income) that was seen during sharp economic downturns in interwar colonial India. The long
run 1939-2012 U shaped trajectories of wealth-income ratios are reasonably explained by a
mid century asset price slowdown and the return of high land shares in national wealth. These
results corroborate the secular increase of wealth-income ratios in most large economies since
the 1980s. The manifestation of this phenomena appears to be independent of the stage of
development.

Introduction

The motivation for this article is the following: as an economy progresses through stages of development, how does the size of aggregate wealth change relative to national income? In preindustrial societies it was possible to imagine vast hoards of wealth in the form of conquered land
and gold despite lack of economic dynamism. The promise of capitalist growth on the other hand
was ambiguous. While in theory one expected society to use its wealth efficiently to produce
more output, the early economic thinkers were skeptics. In the view of Ricardo and Marx, even
capitalism would be challenged1 by the inexorable tendency for wealth accumulation to outstrip
economic growth.

What we know now is that wealth-income ratios are limited by parameters such as growth (g)
and saving (s), but they do in fact have a tendency to be very large. Piketty and Zucman (2014)
used evidence from rich economies2 to show that the relationship between aggregate wealth and
national income agrees well with Solow’s one good model (Solow, 1956). In the long run (almost
three centuries), wealth-income ratios (β = W/Y) gravitated around the ratio s/g. Historically,
this meant β ≈500-600% based on s=10% and g=1.5-2%. The only exceptions were during the
period 1910-70 because of large shocks such as World Wars and unprecedented demographic
expansion. With growth slowdowns since 1980 in most mature economies, wealth-income ratios
seem to be returning to their historic values again.

This article systematically constructs original, new series to study wealth-income ratios in India;
an economy that was (and still is) markedly different in structure and stage of development. I
cover three defining periods of India’s history over the years 1860-2012. These include British
colonial rule (until 1947), the 1950-80 planning experiment right after independence and the post
1980 decades under pro-business and pro-market economic policies. Of special interest are the

Ricardo and Marx posited different mechanisms. The former argued that due to concentrated ownership of limited

assets (such as land), the expansion of production and population growth could create disproportionate wealth via
capitalized rents for landlords. According to Marx, while all wealth was ultimately created by labor, the competition for
higher rates of return would push capitalists to replace labor and accumulate very large capital ultimately leading to
the type of singularities he envisioned as turbulent revolutions

consequences of the land puzzle in India; despite shifts in the savings-growth profile, Indians
continue to retain strong preferences3 for land across the wealth distribution (Subramanian and
Jayaraj, 2006). The importance of land can recur at different stages of development and thus
potentially be a source of fluctuations in wealth-income ratios. For example, this holds for Spain
(Artola et al., 2017) on either end of the 20th century. In the very long run (1210-2013), Britain’s
wealth-income ratios were strongly determined by fluctuations in land values (Madsen, 2019).

The underlying series were developed using historical studies, official surveys and national
accounts consistent with methods and definitions outlined in the UN System of National Accounts
(SNA) as well as the World Inequality Database (WID). To the best of my knowledge this is the
first attempt that constructs and analyzes India’s aggregate wealth-income ratio over such an
extended period. These sparse data have obvious imperfections and serve purely as a lower
limit to what we know about Indian wealth. But they mobilize the best sources at hand and are
essential to answering key questions vis-a-vis wealth accumulation, inequality and growth over the
development process. 18% of Earth’s population lives in India, having democratized at a much
lower level of per-capita incomes than nearly any other large country. Its history is peppered with
structural shifts and a changing global importance that should shed more light on the evolution of
wealth. These include but are not limited to: colonial policies, a U shaped share of global output
in the 20th century, large scale nationalizations and the return of its industrialist class.

According to the findings of this research, in both the 21st century and interwar colonial period,
Indian wealth became as large as 600-700% of national income. Strikingly, these large wealthincome ratios have persisted despite radically different economic environments. The high ratio in
the interwar years was primarily due to an output collapse; the saving rate was only around 3-4%.
In the 21st century, high ratios emerged under very rapid economic growth with substantial capital
accumulation (s=20-24%). The role of relative asset prices is fundamental, explaining to a great
extent why the evolution of wealth relative to national income follows a U shape between 19392012. The intermediate period (1939-80) was characterized by rising consumer price inflation and
a directed industrialization which may have curtailed the relative appreciation of land prices.

The recent evolution of wealth in India has both similarities and differences with results from
other countries. What seems to appear certain is that wealth-income ratios can acquire high values independent of the stage of development (Figure 1). In rich countries this may be due to a
recovery of asset prices and demographic slowdown (higher s/g). Consequently with slow growth
in the West, the search for safe assets may be driving up non-reproducible asset prices in emerging markets (Caballero, 2006) such as China4 and India. This is most evident in cities such as New
Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore where real estate prices rival those of the world’s major metropolitan cities. Such developments may be salient for wealth inequality because India shares many
commonalities with the “cheap privatizations” of China and Russia (Chancel et al., 2018) since
the early 1990s. Wealth and income inequalities have risen in the latter two economies, concurrent with rising wealth-income ratios. While we know that the one-good Solow type process could
lead to equitable wealth distributions due to Stiglitz (1969), it is less likely5 in multi-good models.
The ascent of wealth due to capital gains would probabilistically benefit those who already own
such assets as opposed to new wealth accumulated from rising per-capita incomes as part of a
dual-sector growth process.

In fact the Solow growth model with land usually generates unstable asset bubbles (Nichols, 1970)

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: I discuss the core concepts and data used
to construct the main series in the next section. In section 3, I present key results, decompositions
and the changing structure of national wealth. The last section concludes. The research in this
article is supplemented with an online appendix and dataset (in spreadsheet format) which can
be accessed online at this embedded address.

1.1

Brief background

Indian economic history is steeped in controversial debates. Given that this article deals with (and
sweeps across) a large chunk of time, a brief history will help for context. While the main debates6
can be found elsewhere, there are sufficient stylized facts on which most agree. According to
Maddison (2001), India’s share of global GDP fell from 6% to around 3.8% between 1870 and
1952. By 2012, the IMF7 estimated this share to have returned to nearly 6%. The British Crown
inherited administrative control from the East India Company in 1858 and ruled for almost nine
decades (i.e till 1947). Over this period, real growth rates of national income8 averaged 1.5-1.8%
(1860-1947) which in the long run is not too far from Japanese or American rates of 1.5-3% in
the late nineteenth century. However, India remained predominantly agrarian throughout and percapita growth rates were in fact erratic due to demographic dynamics through the entire period.
While population growth averaged less than 0.5-1% between 1860-1914, there was a noticeable
mortality decline (Guha, 1991) which drove up population growth after 1921.

What these estimates then suggest is slightly increasing per-capita incomes until 1914 and a
stagnation for the remaining colonial period; roughly 0.1% per-capita income growth. This economic decline was at the center of the underdevelopment thesis of nationalist economic writers.
6

The bulk of the controversy relates to the causes (British or internal) behind underdevelopment at the end of

the colonial period. The origin of the debate can be traced to the nationalist writer Dadabhai Naoroji’s “drain” theory
(Naoroji, 1901) which claimed the British were expropriating Indian wealth through taxation. While scholarly attitudes
towards colonialism have tempered down, the core of the discourse continues to be actively debated. A recent
example is Mukherjee (2008) versus Roy (2016). For detailed studies in Indian economic history, the interested
reader may refer to the original Cambridge Economic History of India (Kumar and Desai, 1983), and recent volumes
such as Roy (2011) or Tomlinson (2013)

The crucial patterns under these aggregate statistics are the differential performance between
agriculture and private industry. The growth of agricultural GDP was only around 15% between
1900-46 (Roy, 2006) and its employment of 70% of the workforce implied low wages and poverty
for all associated labor. On the other hand, as Roy (2016) claims, non-agricultural output (real)
nearly doubled and industry cultivated foreign markets and imported skilled labor. Factory output
was growing at a gross rate of 4-5%. This secondary sector improvement stood in contrast to
the century long de-industrialization that India had experienced during Company rule until the mid
nineteenth century (Clingingsmith and Williamson, 2008).

Whatever the causal impact of British rule on under-development, at the time of independence
India was dependent on agriculture, had substantial social and economic inequalities and its early
political class cultivated a mistrust9 of private business. The first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, hired technocrats to plan economic development. Through 1950-75, successive
governments continued on a path of nationalizations of key sectors. These included air and rail
transport, banking, coal and public utilities. Redistributive policies were passed and the rich were
brought under the spheres of progressive estate, wealth and income taxations. Corporate taxes
were high and licensing was employed to ration the role of the private sector.

Despite these explicit measures to take control of the development process, the state was unable to deliver substantial rates of economic growth. Compared to other Asian economies, India’s
low growth between 1950-80 became known as the “Hindu rate of growth.” In understanding
the shift towards much better subsequent macroeconomic performance, Rodrik and Subramanian (2005) cited the change in political attitude towards private business as the most important
distinguishing factor. The electoral rhetoric shifted from distributive justice to economic growth
(Kohli, 2006). It is in this new environment of incorporating private capital, opening up markets
(after reforms in 1991-92) and reverse nationalizations that India began to show very high rates
of economic growth. Around 2012, GDP growth rates averaged almost 8%. Whether growth was
9

India’s leading industrialists gave an economic outline in the 1945 “Bombay Plan.” While Nehru (the first Indian

Prime Minister) had mixed feelings towards the importance of private industry, it is generally agreed that India’s first
two five year plans were de-facto adoptions of the Bombay Plan. Economic historians have identified this development
in two ways. (1) It was the best way for industrialists to protect themselves from global competition and (2) Building
domestic industrial strength was a reaction to the foreign laissez faire type operations which nationalists identified as
diffusing underdevelopment in British India. See Roy (2016)

by its very nature disequalizing, or due to diminished focus on redistribution, this phase is also
associated with increasing inequalities. Chancel et al. (2018) found a return of high top income
shares in 21st century India while wealth inequality also appears to be highest since 1991 (Anand
and Thampi, 2016).

The analysis of trends in aggregate wealth versus national income has the distinct advantage of
threading through the aforementioned types of structural changes. While modes and relations of
production change over time, the idea of wealth accumulation remains and determines to a great
extent how society organizes its production process. Crucially, and despite numerous changes,
India inherently remains a wealth based society where class determines social mobility and the
caste system reinforces hereditary professions. Extreme poverty and riches exist within the same
framework. The goal of this research is not simply to explain persistent factors10 but rather to
engage with, and analyze, these ever-presents (wealth, income, capital accumulation, economic
growth) through evolving modern Indian history.

Data and conceptual notes

2.1

Sources

I use standard concepts outlined in the UN SNA framework to compile a comprehensive digital
dataset of Indian wealth and national incomes in the long run. My construction framework closely
follows attempts to similarly aggregate long run national balance sheets on a cross country basis
by Goldsmith (1985) and Piketty and Zucman (2014). The main challenge is that no unifying
source exists to combine and estimate India’s national wealth. There is to date no official tradition
of compiling national balance sheets, outside of a few dispersed sectoral accounts of assets and
liabilities. This stands in contrast to attempts by Atkinson (1902) and Goldsmith (1983) who were
responding to important debates11 by developing highly detailed historical balance sheets. For
flows in the post 1950 period, I use official national accounts for all net-of-depreciation flows i.e
10

Authors have engaged on such persistencies in recent years. The best example connecting independent India’s

economic potential to colonial systems is perhaps Banerjee and Iyer (2005)

Atkinson was part of the national income debate in the late nineteenth-early twentieth century while Goldsmith

and Gerschenkron were deeply engaged in the financialization-development debates.

national income, capital formation, capital transfers, foreign investment at current prices. For
historical flows of output, income and saving I collected data from Sivasubramonian (2000) and
Maddison (1992). Nominal variables are adjusted when appropriate using the national income
deflator at 2012 prices.

For wealth estimates, I combine official capital stock figures from the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) and land values from nationally representative12 surveys. All available post 1950 estimates of land values exclude the government and corporate sector’s holdings. I adjust for these
by adding 2% to the value of land owned by households. This figure was taken as an assumption
based on estimates from 2012-14 asset disclosures of corporations and public entities. Needless
to say, at this point all land changes are determined effectively by household’s holdings. It is expected that in the future, these disclosures will allow the estimates of the full land component of
national wealth. For pre-1960 estimates of national wealth, I draw upon the homogenous balance
sheets attempted from multiple sources in Goldsmith (1983). Following SNA guidelines, consumer
durables are excluded from net-of-depreciation fixed assets. Foreign balances are taken from the
extended and updated dataset associated with Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007). Public sector balance sheets - i.e the net wealth of administrative government, full and partially controlled public
enterprises - are impossible to complete due to limited disclosures. However I provide elements of
the public balance sheet such as capital outlays (cash flow basis), capital stock at current prices
and public debt13 (internal and external). These information were collected from the government’s
disclosures to the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) as well as annual statements of
assets and liabilities which are part of union budgets of the Central Government of India.

Complete series (1950 onwards) of public sector savings are provided, computed using capital finance sections of the official national accounts. These sections allow a full breakdown of
the national saving rate into public and private saving; something which is otherwise impossible
using purely official tabulations of the national accounts. Demographic data are taken from the

Since government accounts are disclosed for audit purposes, they simply cumulate past flows rather than follow-

ing an accrual system. This works for financial loans but does not give a proper picture of capital assets. I use the
IMF’s accrual based estimate of public debt for core government (Abbas et al., 2011) as the benchmark debt series

B) of this article. The entire dataset can be reconstructed using raw sources digitized in the
supplementary database.

2.2

Main concepts

2.2.1

National wealth

According to the UN SNA “national wealth W is the sum, for the economy as a whole, of nonfinancial assets and net claims on the rest of the world.” It can be defined alternatively as the sum
of public (Wg ) and private wealth (Wp ) where each owns wealth equaling the sum of financial and
net-of-liabilities non financial wealth. Social accounting institutions can be further broken by claims
into households, non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH), corporations, government
and the rest of the world. At the aggregate level, financial wealth nets out to zero since the
liabilities of one sector equals the assets of another.

In simpler terms, national wealth is the aggregation of three kinds of assets. Non-produced
(eg land), produced non-financial assets (eg machinery, buildings, dwellings etc) and net foreign
assets. Economists have long used produced capital stock as the barometer of growth and development, typically being interested in capital-output ratios. Wealth however is a broader concept
bringing together the production side of the economy with real constraints such as limited land
or mineral reserves. Intangibles are also included in the UN SNA accounting framework. In conjunction with the net of liabilities foreign asset position (NFA), national wealth can be written as:
Produced assets

Wt = Vt +
|{z}

z}|{
Kt

+NFAt ≡ Wp + Wg

(1)

Land

All aggregates are measured in current prices. Other non-financial assets such as precious metals
(gold & silver) are also part of national wealth, but I exclude them from benchmark calculations
due to lack of consistent data. These assets play a much smaller role in the production side of the

10

economy but do impact aggregate demand depending on saving preferences14 of households.
Using assumptions on data from scattered sources, alternative wealth series have also been
computed; readers are referred to the supplementary database and online appendix for details.
Inclusion of gold and silver increases the size of aggregate national wealth but on the whole their
movements are not large enough to change any long run trends.

2.2.2

Market value vs book value national wealth

Although SNA definitions of national wealth correspond to perpetual inventory type methods
(PIM), recently many authors, following Piketty and Zucman (2014), have begun to rely on market
value national wealth where corporate net worth is measured using the equity holdings of households. Book value national wealth equals market value national wealth plus the residual net worth
of the corporate sector with both definitions converging when Tobin’s Q equals 1. In my assessment with corporate balance sheet constraints it is a rather huge challenge to compute market
value national wealth with precision. I only use book value national wealth in all my series. Over
the long run there is sufficient reason to assume that market and book values would be relatively
similar in trend if not size. Although in the appendix I discuss the pros and cons of applying either
method to India, I discuss the main elements briefly.

In the 1950s, according to industrial reports, Mukherjee and Sastry (1959) found market value
national wealth to be quite well approximated by book value measurement. It is likely that Tobin’s
Q was lower during the peak years of the Hindu rate of growth because of financial repression.
In more recent years, evidence from samples of corporations suggests Tobin’s Q is close to 1;
roughly 1.1-1.2 in the 1990s (Khanna and Palepu, 2005) and around 0.94 for large Indian corporations in the 2000s (Allen et al., 2006). Its important to note, following the latter reference, that
market capitalization and Tobin’s Q in India is a very imperfect source of information regarding
14

Indian households have historically had a tremendous affinity to holding gold and silver in their portfolio. This

preference has withstood the changing economic structures of over a century. Badarinza et al. (2016) estimate a
significant fraction of household wealth stored in gold around 2011-12. Imports of gold were strongly regulated in the
post independence era but for past political elites, especially royals, gold was the main store of value. Administrators
were acutely aware of this and foreign conquerors were seduced by the stock of gold stored in India. Atkinson (1902)
used production capacity and rough estimates of plunder and loot to estimates the stock of gold in the late nineteenth
century. Gold & silver were worth almost one year of national income in this period.

11

corporate net worth. Historically, the equities of a large fraction of Indian companies do not experience much (if any) trading. Inventories which appear on book value accounts on the other hand
move faster, giving a more updated sense of prices.

2.2.3

Income and savings

The definition of national income (Y) is standard, i.e net-of-depreciation domestic product plus
net factor income (NFIA) from abroad. The flow of savings (S) are defined as net-of-depreciation
capital formation plus net foreign investment and capital transfers from abroad. Coverage of saving flows, especially after 1950 is very complete and allows a full institutional decomposition of
savings. Each institution’s saving is the sum of capital expenditure and net lending. I use capital finance accounts to compute public sector (administrative government, public enterprises) savings.
Private savings are derived as the residual of national less public saving flows.

2.2.4

Series coverage

The integrated database, at the heart of this research, represents a unique and integrated set of
long run macroeconomic facts for India. These aggregated time series for the first time combine
national balance sheets, continuous long run national income, price indices for output and equities,
decompositions of wealth accumulation and the structure of saving and capital formation.

The coverage of all series constructed here is as follows: National wealth and its components
are available for the 1860-2012 period. Aggregate national wealth is annualized for the 1913-2012
period using multiplicative wealth equations i.e when price deflator, capital gains and savings information is available. Capital stock series (domestic produced assets) are annual starting 1981.
National income data is annual for 1900-2012 along with further estimates for 1860, 1875 and
1895 using Goldsmith’s adjustments for depreciation. The aggregate saving rate is available for
1900-2012 and its private and public decompositions start in 1951. Since pre-1900 national incomes and inflation estimates are too fragile and contentious, I do not use them in any decompositions. Selective government assets are given for select years in the post-independence era
1950-2012 but public debt estimates are annual for the same reference period.

12

2.3

Wealth-income ratios

The evolution of wealth itself is determined by accounting for new capital accumulation and revaluation of existing assets:
Wt+n = Wt + St + δt+n Wt

(2)

Basically, changes in the level of wealth over time are either volume (savings) driven or due to a
price effect (capital gains, δt+n Wt ). From a macro-history perspective, the key long term evolution is
βt = Wt /Yt ; the wealth-income ratio. β denotes the years of annual national incomes necessary to
reproduce the stock of wealth. Obviously capital, wealth and production change enormously over
time so that (more than constant price series) wealth-income ratio scales these metamorphoses
in a meaningful way.

If in the long run there are no relative price deviations (δ = 0) - for example if wealth is purely
reproducible capital - then the steady state is defined by convergence of wealth and income growth
rates βt → β = s/g. The slower the rate of economic growth, the longer it takes for national income
to reconstitute the stock of wealth. Fundamentally, this is the one good Harrod-Domar-Solow
steady state result but it applies to a more general class of models with balanced growth. Since
asset prices have in fact played an important role historically, one-good models are not always
justified. Sustained price deviations can result from to asymmetric economic shocks, real estate
pressures or structural capitalization of monopoly rents. It is better to empirically distinguish the
contribution of each to why and how wealth evolves historically.

2.4

Multiplicative versus additive wealth equations

Using the framework in Eqq 2 and macro-accounting, wealth accumulation can be decomposed
into its constituent driving forces - savings, asset prices and initial wealth. I capture the main
channels (accumulation versus prices) using decomposition equations. In multiplicative models,
where wealth evolves according to Wt+1 = (1 + q)(Wt + sYt ), components of wealth accumulation
can be split according to:
1+q =

(1 + gw )
(1 + gws )

(3)

Where 1 + q is the (real) capital gains factor, 1 + gw = (Wt+1 )(Wt ) is the wealth growth factor and
1 + gws is the volume driven wealth growth factor with gws = s/βt . With savings rate information,
the capital gains factor can be derived as a residual.
13

The additive equation can be derived directly by cumulating savings and dividing Eqq 2 by Yt+1
to get:
βt+n =

Wt
Yt+n
|{z}

Initial wealth

+

St,t+n
Yt+n
| {z
}

Cumulated savings

+

δt+n Wt
Yt+n
| {z
}

(4)

Cumulated capital gains

With either method, I use the capital gains portion (1 + q or

δt+n Wt
)
Yt +n

to capture all other determinants

barring saving rates or cumulated saving. They are the residual explanations when growth of
wealth cannot be explained purely by savings as per the data. Note that in the long run, savings
are much more essential to the multiplicative equation because asset prices need to be “multiplied”
with some non-zero element. Even with structural capital gains, as n → ∞, if saving rates are
rising over time then they will acquire much more importance as an explanation of 1 + gw . The
additive decomposition is better in the medium run, particularly because the initial wealth factor15
can be important over smaller time frames. I provide both decompositions since they convey
important information in different ways. For interpolations between benchmark years, I only use
the multiplicative model.

Results: Indian wealth in the long run

It is best to start with what is arguably the most simple and straightforward result. According to
Figure 2 India became wealthier in the early 21st century. By 2012, national wealth was worth
almost 550-600% (or six years) of national income as opposed to around 350-400% at the end of
the nineteenth century, i.e more than a century ago. The accumulation of produced assets in the
21st century seemed to be almost three years worth of national income, compared to two around
1895. Consider that in 1895, Indian national income was a fraction of the equivalent in Britain,
while in 2012 it ranked amongst the top ten economies and the size of wealth accumulation is
undoubtedly impressive. This is in fact what should be expected from increasing the production
frontier over the development process. Real national income multiplied nearly 1800% between
1900-01 and 2000-01 with the bulk of growth concentrated around the end of the 20th century.
Sustained per-capita income growth pushed living standards above subsistence, so that higher
savings and capital accumulation were made possible. Table 1 shows an almost quadrupling of
saving rates over 1950-80 and then doubling from 1980-2012. Higher wealth-income ratios on

any historical background of India’s colonial economy, would it be realistic to claim that India
was in fact “wealthiest” during the interwar period? The simple answer is obviously no, and the
temporary nature of these high values is immediately obvious considering the immediate decline
during World War II and Indian independence. Reinstating reality, India did not suffer the same
wartime capital destructions as Europe16 to experience such a decline. More likely, the interwar
surge was itself a temporary amplification due to prices and economic downturns. Remembering
the narrow range of assets and previous phase of capital accumulation (1860-1913) even a small
decline in nominal output could produce high wealth-income ratios.

3.1

Decompositions and the changing structure of wealth

Regardless, the gap between the growth rates of wealth and output was nearly 1.5% more in
colonial India’s last few decades, thereafter reducing to less than 1% in the subsequent years.
To assess the role of accumulated savings versus asset-output price deviations in the long run,
I estimated multiplicative wealth equations for India between 1913 and 2012. The results are
presented in Table 2. Relative asset prices dominated the colonial wealth-income ratio, i.e they

Table 2: Sources of wealth accumulation 1913-2012. Multiplicative decompositions using benchmark wealth series. Supplementary database (Table 6A)
explained almost 70% of the real growth of wealth. This effect corroborates the magnitude and
importance of price fluctuations estimated by Roy (1995) for the early-mid twentieth century. After
independence, the bulk explanation shifted toward savings driven wealth growth. Interestingly, in
the post 1980s period the contribution of savings was even larger than 1950-80. It is worth noting
that nationalizations and land reforms (between 1955-74) were hardly a recipe for better capital
gains. And in fact, as expected the real rate of capital gains was marginally higher in 1981-2012
than in 1950-80. At the estimated rates (1.72%), relative price appreciations would alone have
increased wealth to around 170% of its initial 1981 level. The underlying effect is in fact purely
a reflection of consistently higher saving rates17 for every subsequent period. These increases
were impressive enough so that s actually rose more than β to deliver higher gsw = s/β. Real
rates of capital gains in the 1.5% to 1.8% range would have mattered much more with a 10% rate
of saving, as opposed to 20-24% between 1981-2012.

3.1.1

Interwar India and the determinants of wealth growth

The interwar period is of particular interest because growth rates were low enough to amplify a
small capital gain into higher wealth-income ratios. For example, consider a 300% wealth-income
ratio and no further accumulation or economic growth. With a 1.8% real rate of capital gains, the
ratio rises to almost 430% in two decades. By it’s very nature, this size of wealth is a candidate
17

Note that saving rates are period wise averages

so that saving rates associated with higher levels of

national income carry more weight. Since produced assets are measured at book value, they will rise with higher
capital accumulation in high saving phases

17

to disappear just as quickly due to (say) 1-2% national income growth or even a collapse in the
market for a particular asset that undergoes appreciation. The question is which assets were
generating price appreciations during the interwar period. A second (related) question is whether
the magnitude was amplified perhaps by a denominator effect. The wealth-income ratio has an
asset price index in its numerator and an output price index in its denominator, which means a fall
in output prices can also generate real capital gains. Separate trajectories for national wealth and
income (nominal) in Figure 4 show that this denominator effect was indeed present. With foreign
demand collapsing after the Great Depression, nominal output trended strongly downwards. The
value of wealth stayed stable between 1920-39 leading to a divergences between asset and output
prices. A denominator driven rise in the wealth-income ratio is not unique to India. Evidence from
other countries suggests a similar trend during the Great Depression (Figure 5)

Figure 4: National wealth and income at scale.
In terms of actual price appreciations, produced assets such as the capital stock of corporations
are not ideal candidates for appreciating assets in the national portfolio. Since they are measured
at book value they correspond closely18 to output prices. In fact, as Figure 6 shows, the aggregate value of land was playing a salient role in the evolution of the 1920-39 wealth-income ratio.
18

Of course there are still remnant price effects due to the changing composition of reproducible assets, for example

using more new machinery with different lifespans.

Foreign assets (negative throughout) were much lower, measured in terms of national income.
An accumulation of produced assets did occur, especially between 1929-39. But its magnitude
appears to have been dwarfed by the prominence of land. What is most crucial is that after 1939
the ratio of land to national income rapidly declined. This occurred well before the loss of any
land area (and national income) to Pakistan after the partition of 1947. Since land cannot otherwise be destroyed, these overall dynamics had to be combinations of land prices and pre-1947
denominator effects.

The rising price of land in class based societies was a well known feature of Ricardian rent
theory. In an economy with ongoing capital accumulation, Ricardo hypothesized that once the best
land was exhausted, production would have to move to less fertile land requiring more investment
to sustain high yields. In a land market with binding supply constraints, land prices would have
to rise to stem the high demand from capital accumulation and population growth. The prediction
was an enrichment of the landowning gentry19 who had inherited rights to this non-reproducible
(or natural) asset. This theory was not far off the mark in interwar India. Economic historians of
all vintages collectivize around colonial India’s land dependence. Land literally became scarce in
19

To be sure, there need not be a realized land constraint. In a growth model with given wage rates, even the

anticipation of future rents (when the limit become effective), get capitalized into higher prices in the present. See the
land constrained model in Foley and Michl (1999).

rural India, where over 70% of the country’s population resided. Economic growth over 1870-1914
had mostly exploited low hanging fruit. Agricultural yields stayed static and expansion derived
entirely from increased acreage. The slowdown in acreage, starting in the second decade of the
twentieth century, was at the root of the economic crises that plagued the economy through the
entire interwar period (Roy, 2006). To be sure, the pressure from the demand side did not ease
in conjunction with the supply side limit. Land per person continued to fall secularly because
India underwent a huge demographic shift20 starting 1921. No further area was brought under
cultivation and the urban component was too small a fraction(Goldsmith, 1983) to matter. In an
already narrow asset range, the portfolio value of land ownership therefore went up.
Considering the flat nominal value21 of wealth between 1920-39 and the output descent, what
matters is land prices rose in some regions even if they fell in others during the depression years.
20

Due to the rise of commerce in the late nineteenth century, agricultural output became more heavily cash crop

oriented. The little productivity growth in yields was entirely in commercial crops. Food crops stayed stagnant in terms
of output per acre. The 1918-21 period was a demographic shift in 20th century India. Birth rates stayed stable but
death rates declined. From 0.5-0.6% in previous decades, India’s population grew consistently over 1.1% after 1921.
See Guha (1991)
21

In nominal terms, the value of land stayed almost the same for 1929 and 1939

20

Micro studies conducted by different authors identified significant price appreciations in land markets which speak to this claim. Hirashima (2008) analyzed land trading in integrated Punjab until
1940, i.e the territory which now falls in India and Pakistan. Note that between 1870-1939 Punjab
had received a third of irrigation investment and formed half the total irrigated area. It was one of
the more prioritized regions in the agrarian expansion program. Transactions data revealed that
while rents grew in spurts, land prices rose almost continuously. The creation of a land market
around 1890 itself drew different players into trading of this asset. Using investment and rental
data, Hirashima estimated speculative capital gains to be the main explanation for price appreciations. A separate study of land records in the same time and region by Mukerji (1969) put land
price appreciation at nearly 1000%.

Figure 7: Income inequality and property income shares in interwar India
In hindsight, social and class inequalities during the interwar period underline the environment
under high wealth-income ratios. Those who owned property or capital prospered while wage
dependent rural masses were hit by the economic slowdown. The Nizam (ruler) of Hyderabad
was ranked on top of the global wealth rankings by Time Magazine22 in 1937, whilst poverty was

peaking in India. The entire princely class (around 600 local rulers) found its net worth swelling
at a time where agriculture was unprofitable while domestic industry needed capital. Accordingly,
their wealth became more “in-demand” for industrial finance under the capital downturn in global
markets induced by the depression (Mukherjee, 2008). Top income shares surged and income
from property holdings peaked between 1920-39 (Figure 7). Alvaredo et al. (2017) estimate that
the rich were mostly Indians, rather than British officials based in India. These included professionals who worked outside agriculture but also the landowning classes and indigenous capitalists
(Maddison, 1971). In terms of retaining surpluses, the 1930s were beneficial both pre and post
taxes for the landed gentry. Their obligations to the state had been set in nominal terms around
the 1880s. By the 1930s they only paid a fraction of their surplus as land revenues, retaining most
of it.

3.2

Resurgent asset prices and international comparison

I refrain from calling the interwar period a “bubble” because the rise and fall of wealth-income
ratios lasted a full four decades (1920-60). And realistically, they were mostly a marriage including
economic growth, demographics and structural factors such as aggregate land shortages; as
opposed to pure speculative price appreciations. Just as India did not get wealthy during the Great
Depression, it did not become poor or capital-efficient with falling wealth-income ratios between
1939-60.

The aggregate value of wealth did however come down from 670% to almost 390% by 1960,
and it was once again mostly land driven. A central factor initiating this process was the return of
nominal output prices23 and real economic growth during the wartime buildup. Pressing demand
switched towards industrial capital and British borrowing was strong enough to temporarily reverse
the net-debtor position of India. Certainly events that directly impacted the volume of land were
important; such as the independence or partition of India and annexation of land from the two
main agrarian regions (Punjab, Bengal) into Pakistan. But the decline continued well into the
23

Consumer price inflation and declining wage ratios between agriculture and industrial labor have been cited as

the main explanation of rural distress in this period. The Bengal Famine of 1943, a combination of high rice prices,
labor destitution and forced saving is one such case study. See Sen (1981)

22

1950s24 i.e after the political turbulences of the 1939-47 period. The sole constant for the full two
decades up to 1960 was that nominal and real economic growth were higher than pre-1939 rates.
It implies a very simple mechanism. Just as wealth-income ratios rose because of low growth,
they declined because of higher growth.

Perhaps the main distinguishing feature of the post 1960s period is lower output fluctuations.
This explains a gradual, non-erratic trend in wealth-income ratios. Economic growth accelerated
after 1980 as India moved out of Hindu rates of growth (Rodrik and Subramanian, 2005). But
there were no decade long stagnations at any point between 1960-2012. Even the Hindu growth
period of 1950-80 had significant per-capita income growth rates (1.1%-1.5%). Capital accumulation however was changing with the rate of saving rising and the state directly embarking on a
capital-led industrialization strategy25 as early as the 1950s. It is tempting to attribute the rising
wealth-income ratio to a Solow-Marx type deterministic capital accumulation process. As further
decompositions based on additive wealth equations (Table 3) show, the underlying forces are
slightly more complex.
The key long run statistic here is that between 1913-2012, cumulated capital gains explain a
very large proportion of aggregate wealth. That is, starting with wealth in 1913 as a proportion
1913
of 2012 national income ( W
), half the subsequent additions were cumulated savings. The reY2012

maining changes, nearly half (45%) save for initial wealth, were accounted for by asset prices.
Looking into shorter sub-periods as series, it is clear that the nature of wealth accumulation transformed significantly. In the interwar period, initial wealth mattered a lot (because national income
was barely growing). Remembering that post 1960 trends in wealth-income ratios are gradual,
24

Again there were sufficient reasons to believe that land was less valuable in itself. In the 1950s, India initiated

land reforms to mitigate the socio-economic inequalities of rural society inherited from the British empire. This land
reform was redistributive rather than expansive. Large owners who enriched themselves during the depression stood
to lose sizable estates and would have found few buyers given that official ceilings restricted the accumulation of
sizable holdings.
25

The second five year plan (1956-61) - modeled along Soviet lines was developed by the statistician PC Maha-

lanobis. It was inspired by the Harrod-Feldman model of growth with explicit focus on developing the capital goods
sector. The model itself has a theoretical side, expressed in Mahalanobis (1953). It was soon sacrificed when inflation concerns arose but the state controlled model of accumulation was enmeshed in policy thinking well into the
1970s. Historians and political scientists often claim this to be a residual of mistrust in private capital, an idea probably
inherited from the laissez-faire thinking around capital in British India. See Kohli (2006)

Table 3: Sources of wealth accumulation 1913-2012. Additive decompositions using benchmark
wealth series. Supplementary database (Table 6A)
initial wealth remained important but its share was increasingly appropriated by savings. Perhaps most strikingly, this type of decomposition reveals the close determination of the shape of
wealth-income ratios due to asset price fluctuations alone.

In additive wealth equations, the presence of initial wealth distinguishes the magnitude of capital
gains. To understand the revival of asset prices, one has to contextualize the initial wealth on
which these price gains were being made. In recent periods, gains were large despite smaller
initial wealth. Take for example 1920-29 as a representative sub-period. As a proportion of 1929
national income, initial wealth was worth 380% and it produced a gain worth 100%. Now consider
2002-2012 in terms of 2012 national income. Initial wealth was only around 225% but it produced

24

a gain worth 154%. Clearly gains were larger in magnitude for the latter period. The fall and rise
of wealth between 1939-2012 is strongly reflected in the U shaped size of capital gains. There
were clear capital losses during price corrections in the 1939-46 period. But gradually, cumulated
capital gains returned to around 100-150% of national income (or 22-28% or the wealth-income
ratio) around 1981-2012.

So far any discussion of capital gains is essentially a discussion of land prices. Would the
wealth-income ratio (and its determinants) be any different if market-value national wealth was
deployed? By the latter measure, the book value of corporate assets would be replaced by market
value assets and asset price dynamics would include fluctuations in Tobin’s q. A limited (but
meaningful) understanding can be gleaned on the basis of equity price indices. Figure 8 tracks
the evolution of listed equity prices relative to consumer price inflation with the ratio set at 100% for
2012. These trends reveal most certainly that equities appreciated faster than consumer inflation.
Most economists and financial experts would agree to this fact. The interesting trend in this
series is a J shape between 1957-2012, i.e post independence inflation expropriated equity prices
through to the late 1980s. That these developments rand parallel to nationalizations and high
corporate taxes in the 1960s and 1970s is hardly surprising. On the whole however, these ratios
25

remain in agreement26 with benchmark wealth-income ratios for India over this period. If anything,
a market value measure would have magnified the contributions of asset prices slightly for 19812012.

As far as wealth holdings in recent decades are concerned, volume and prices of land are still
the most important determinants. In colonial India, land ownership and scarcity dominated. But
even in 2012, households continue to hold over 60% (90%) of their wealth as land (real estate)
according to NSSO surveys. Preferences for holding land were inelastic across generations and
the wealth distribution (Anand and Thampi, 2016). Note that financial deepening and access in
India are still fairly limited, meaning safety and low risk returns can be easily channeled into such
traditional forms of wealth ownership. Land acquisition remains the most contentious political issue and center of peasant conflict despite industrial growth or agricultural distress (Levien, 2012).
Even looking at the extreme upper tail of the wealth distribution, Gandhi and Walton (2012) found
capitalists in real estate and construction sectors to be the major movers on billionaire rankings
(and net worth) since the 1990s.

The corporate sector was less than 18% of produced domestic assets around 1980 and rose to around 29% by

2012. Thus its impact on aggregate wealth would have been significant mostly after 2000

26

Figure 9 shows cross country land per person for the largest economies in 2012. Clearly,
land in India is most scarce relative to population. A relative “land abundance effect” may also
explain the comparative importance of land in national wealth. For example, a labor surplus (or
abundance) is often used to explain lower wages in developing countries as opposed to (say)
Western Europe. Based on the same logic, Piketty and Zucman (2014) attributed high land prices
in nineteenth century Europe to lower land volume. In USA, around the same period, land was
relatively abundant and so worth less in comparative terms. Countries with lower land volume per
worker should have higher27 land values relative to national income. A similar mechanism could,
in principle, reinforce India’s persistently high land to national income ratios.

Comparative long run evolutions: India vs rich countries

I turn next towards the evolution of Indian wealth relative to rich countries. Starting in the 1960s,
wealth-income ratios in India, USA, UK and France became quite similar in size28 and trend. In
the late 20th century, these ratios were in the 400-500% range and closer to 500-600% in the
21st century. The underlying processes were however deeply different. Europe and USA had
sustained very large wealth-income ratios well before the beginning of the twentieth century. The
latter half of the twentieth century represented a recovery of capital and asset prices to their peaks.
The Indian peaks were a short lived divergence, also visible in rich countries. Effectively, India
was only building its wealth and capital after independence. In the second half of the nineteenth
century, disparities were much more apparent. Indian wealth was only worth around two to three
years of national income. British and French wealth stood at over seven years29 of their respective
national incomes.

Why were wealth-income ratios so low in India in the nineteenth century? One candidate explanation may be that the prevailing rentier type society30 had little incentive to improve the viability
27

Assuming the elasticity of substitution between land and labor is less than 1

28

Only the American ratio falls in 2012 due to very high public debt

29

The lower US wealth-income ratio is mostly due to faster growth relative to Europe and therefore a lower s/g

steady state
30

A good indication is that surpluses had been sunk into a huge stock of unproductive assets like gold and silver.

Their size was worth almost 100% of national income (Figure 6). Note that a rentier system was reinforced by the the
corporate nature of the East India Company, which had no overwhelming burden to radically modernize the existing

of agriculture (Maddison, 1971). For example, European land received past investment (irrigation,
drainage) which made it much more productive in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Indian
landlords were on the other hand content to retain their share of the surplus once land revenues
had been paid out. Relatedly, under the low growth and productivity economic environment, savings may have been too low in the first half of the nineteenth century to allow capital accumulation.

From the outset, it is important to state that data for this period are too fragile and information
on savings non-existent. But based on reliable and independent accounts31 the suggestion is
that economic dynamism only re-appeared once the British Crown came to power in 1858. Poor
economies with low saving had a tendency to settle into smaller wealth-income ratios than for
example in France or Britain. A classic example is the Swedish case in the mid-nineteenth century
(Waldenström, 2017). Wealth-income ratios in Sweden were similar to the US, with the former
saving low saving rates and the latter having higher growth rates but both being close on the
equilibrium s/g profile.
social structure. In fact, the Company was well aware of the the Ricardian theory of rent, which it used to identify
differential profitabilities of land in order to develop property systems. See McAlpin (1984)

3.2.3

Political economy of Indian public wealth

Finally, I turn to the changing ownership of national wealth. Was the evolution of Indian wealth the
same as the trajectories of private or public wealth? Unfortunately, there are no balance sheets
at either level to clearly establish a stylized fact. But the limited data on hand suggest that barring
a brief departure in the 1950-80 “planned” phase, the national wealth-national income ratio was
closely tracking the private wealth-national income ratio.

Under British rule, the government operated primarily as an administrator, rather than providing basic industrial capital through state enterprises. The British empire kept tax rates low, using
revenues to mostly maintain its army and technocrats. There was little by way capital expansion
through state enterprises, research or educational institutions. The empire instead allowed indigenous entrepreneurs to function under an unfettered integration with global commerce (Mukherjee,
1976). National wealth, was mostly private wealth and the wealth-income ratio until 1950 could
just as easily be termed the private wealth-national income ratio (Goldsmith, 1983).

Figure 11: Public vs private capital capital formation 1951-2012
Obviously the public sector had to radically transform itself in the early years of independence.
From the low initial level around 1950, there is little doubt that the activist state did much to increase capital accumulation and public capital. Question marks only pertain to its efficacy. In this
29

period, there were indicative steps that usurped private wealth into public accounts as for example
due to nationalizations between 1955-74. But more concretely, the government founded various
public enterprises which then were given monopolies in all the crucial sectors of the economy.
Public investment dominated private investment until the mid 1980s (Figure 11). These assets
were combined with explicit steps to restrict the personal assets of the rich through highly progressive direct taxations (estate, gifts, wealth and incomes) between 1953-85 (Acharya, 2005).

Overall, relative to colonialism, the share of public wealth had to have been higher in the first
decades of independence. Remember that the ratio of land values (mostly private) to national
income was falling until at least 1960. Given that eventually the public sector both moved out and
was outgrown by the private sector since the 1980s implies that in all likelihood, this pattern was
reversed leading into 2012. On the 1860-2012 timeline, if there was ever a peak in the public
wealth-national income ratio it had to have been in the planned economic phase of 1950-80.

Figure 12: The evolution of saving rates 1900-2012
Ideally, one would prefer to evaluate this hypothesis using direct data, i.e for the public sector
utilize the sum of its financial assets (net of liabilities) and non-financial assets. The secondary
approach (used here) is probabilistic. Conditional on the initial size of the public sector around
1980, evidence from saving and debt favor the possibility that national wealth increasingly became

30

private wealth. National wealth is the sum of public and private wealth. At an aggregate steady
state, both should have wealth-national income ratios close to their individual state state formulas
si /g, where si is the rate of saving of each sector. The sector with higher saving rates would have
a higher share of national wealth. From the decomposition of the national saving rate in Figure
12 that throughout 1950-2012 the rising national saving rate was being driven by the private
saving rate. The public saving rate, lower throughout, turned almost persistently negative starting
in the 1990s. The second (and complementary to saving) indicator for lower public wealth is
the size of public debt and trends in the size of public capital (Figure 14). Relative to national
income, the increase of public debt since 1985 supports the likelihood that the government’s net
financial assets became smaller. At the same time, the value of public assets were expropriated by
economic growth. In 1985, the public sector’s non-financial assets were worth almost 150-160%
national income and fell to nearly 100% by 2012. Note that accompanying these trends was
a rising share of produced assets in national wealth, consistent with the fact that on aggregate
these assets became increasingly private (Figure 14).

Figure 14: Public vs private capital share (non-financial) 1981-2012
represented secularly rising private saving rates and falling public saving rates since 1960 (3) an
increasing share of non-financial assets at the national level since 1990 were accounted for by
the private sector. It would therefore be extremely unlikely to conclude that public wealth as a proportion of national income rose as fast as private wealth after 1990. Further, this feature strongly
agrees with the general decline of public capital in developed and emerging economies since the
mid 1980s (Chancel et al., 2018).

Conclusion

My conclusions are brief. The size and evolution of Indian wealth has been closely dependent on
structural shifts and fluctuations in economic growth. Karl Marx had famously argued in Volume I
of Capital:
Intrinsically, it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the
social antagonisms that result from the natural laws of capitalist production. It is a
question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies working with iron necessity
towards inevitable results. The country that is more developed industrially only shows,
to the less developed, the image of its own future
The basic idea was that accumulation would lead to ever more hoards of capital - the ultimate
32

wealth and ambition of the central antagonists (capitalists) of Marx’s thesis. These “stages” would
distinguish rich and poor economies. Yet, economic theory has long debated the importance of
price versus quantity adjustments and the same concepts apply to the value of wealth in all sorts
of economies. From the path of development followed by India, it is obvious that price effects
(such as those of Ricardo) and quantities of capital as emphasized by Marx and Solow are both
important in determining the importance of aggregate wealth. Because both forces can recur at
different stages of development, and certainly due to political/institutional imbalances, the value
of wealth need not follow a deterministic linear path.

This article has presented a first attempt to trace the balance sheets of India in the long run.
It does so using limited data and presents evidence for a non-linear evolution of wealth-income
ratios in India. While they are important on their own, these fluctuations may also be crucial
benchmarks to understand Indian wealth inequality in the long run. At the moment, these series
and their decompositions are all that are permitted by existing data.
