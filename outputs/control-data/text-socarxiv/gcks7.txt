Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Women with intellectual disability have a low level of competencies that
would allow them to better manage their sexuality; consequently, they have a low level of
control over their own health.
OBJECTIVES: The article describes the results of author’s own research into selected
aspects of sexual health of women with intellectual disability (ID). The focus has been on
issues such as menstruation, health and gynecological care, pharmacologization,
contraception, STDs, and menopause.
METHODS: The research was conducted with 11 women using structured interviews.
RESULTS: Results suggest that these women have a low level of competencies to manage
and control health problems in an optimal way. Their behavior is determined by people from
their living environment to a large extent. Women with ID report various abnormalities in the
course of developmental phenomena and in their own health, indicating potentially serious
diseases and disorders.
CONCLUSION: Women with intellectual disability require lifelong support in meeting their
health needs. Such support should be provided by institutions of care, health and social
assistance.
Key words: sexual health, intellectual disability, gynecological care, contraception, STD

Medical Aspects of Disability

1. Introduction
Sexual health of people with intellectual
disability (ID) is more and more often the
subject of research. Problem exploration proves
that women with ID have menstrual periods and
experience similar problems and discomforts to
those seen in the general population (Ibralic,
Sinanovic & Memisevic, 2010; Mason &
Cunningham, 2008; Rodgers, 2001). The
differences found in this respect are mainly
quantitative (range and frequency) rather than
qualitative (Chou, Lu & Pu, 2009; Kyrkou,
2005; Rodgers, Lipscombe & Santer, 2006).
The increasingly longer life expectancy of these
women makes them experience menopause
with its characteristic symptoms (McCarthy &
Millard, 2003; Seltzer, Schupf & Wu, 2001;
Willis, Wishart & Muir, 2010; 2011), but
neither they, nor the people around them are
conscious of it (McCarthy & Millard, 2003;
Willis et al., 2011). Women with ID have a low
level of competencies (especially knowledge)
that would allow them to better manage
biological processes and, more broadly, their
sexuality (Borawska-Charko, Rohleder, Mick
& Finlay, 2017; Wilkinson, Deis, Bowen &
Bokhour, 2011); consequently, they have a low
level of control over their own health. To a large
extent, their behavior in the sphere of health is
determined by the attitudes of their carers –
especially informal carers (Mason &
Cunningham, 2008). There are many
environmental barriers (socio-cultural, legal,
economic and organizational) which have an
impact on poor access to preventive healthcare
in terms of preventing STDs, cancer, and
dysfunctions in natural biological processes
such as menstruation (Greenwood &
Wilkinson, 2013; Thompson, Stancliffe, Broom
& Wilson, 2014). Low awareness of health
service representatives in the area of disability
results in lack of individualization and
personalization of their services. The very
extent of the incidence of health problems
specific to women (such as cervical and breast
cancer etc.) is heterogeneous in this population.
It should be noted that the more favorable
tendencies towards women in the general
population, found in some studies, may be due
to shorter life expectancy, limited access to

health screenings or concentration on a selected
group of women with ID, e.g. institution
residents, with the exclusion of those living in
open communities, who have greater
opportunities to lead an active sex life (Gribben
& Bell, 2010; Rurangirwa, Van Naarden Braun,
Schendel & Yeargin-Allsopp, 2006; Patja, Eero
& Livanainen, 2001; Wilkinson & Cerreto,
2008). Problems in obtaining informed consent
for participation in medical procedures (such as
sterilization and a Pap test), understanding
information communicated by the specialists,
and the capability of using public information,
such as invitations to free health checkups can
also be found in the population of women with
ID (Broughton & Thompson, 2000; Gribben &
Bell, 2010). Not only the cognitive ability, but
also the involvement of carers and specialists
play a significant role here.
The aim of this research is to learn about
experiences of women with ID in the sphere of
sexual health. Sexual health is very broad topic,
hence the focus has been on selected issues
fundamental in this area. Respondents’
knowledge, declared skills and behaviors,
motivations, emotional and physical sensations,
problems and needs were taken into account.

2. Materials and methods
Structured interviews conducted in direct
contact were used in the research. Interviews
were carried out using the own structure
questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided
into 7 problem areas: 1) menstruation
(occurrence, duration, hygiene measures used,
difficulties, menstrual ailments, menarche onset,
previous preparation, significance of menstrual
periods); 2) contraceptives and hormonal
substances (use of contraceptives, awareness of
their intended use, use of hormonal substances,
their effectiveness); 3) use of healthcare
(frequency and autonomy in using medical care,
types of specialists, motivations); 4) use of
gynecological care (frequency, self-reliance,
motivations, assessment of contact with the
gynecologist - preparation for examination,
physical and mental sensations, understanding
of information, participation in cytology tests
and breast cancer screening); 5) STDs
(knowledge of the STDs, knowledge of

HIV/AIDS, awareness of ways to protect
oneself against STDs); 6) sex education (sex
education at school, in the family, autonomous
activity in search of information, the need for
education); 7) biological changes over time
(awareness of changes in the body and new
ailments, knowledge of the term menopause).
Interviews were 15 to 40 minutes long
depending on the duration of the women’s
utterances. Each interview began with the
respondent’s general assessment of their own
health and wellbeing, an indication of the
experienced problems and medication used.
The research was carried out with 11
respondents (table 1), all of whom are residents
in institutions providing care and social and
occupational rehabilitation (daily activity center
and occupational therapy workshops). The
selection criteria of the respondents were
primarily their ability to establish verbal contact
and their motivation to share their own
experiences with the researcher. Preliminary
consent, allowing the researcher to enter the
institution, was obtained from the institution
management in oral form, after prior
notification of the purpose of the research and
presentation of the subject matter of the
interviews. Women who were recruited for the
study could give their consent after they had
been informed about the purpose and the
general subject matter of the study. Each time
they were asked for permission to record the
interview. Women stay in daily support agency
(occupational therapy workshops and daily
activity centre), therefore, consent to conduct
the research was obtained from the
management of the institution, who were
presented with the research goal and method,
and the interview questionnaire.

3. Results
Assessing one’s own health and wellbeing is
often independent of the real problems that
women face. The respondents (especially older
women) report suffering from diseases such as
hypertension, osteoporosis, spinal disorders,
disorders of the thyroid gland, epilepsy, allergy,
asthma, mycosis, mental problems such as
diagnosed depression, and neurosis. As a result
of these diseases women are on long-term

control medications. In the course of the
interviews serious problems that require
medical treatment were indicated, such as breast
tumors (the woman underwent surgery), huge
cysts on ovaries (before making a decision
about possible surgery), and ovarian apoplexy.
Not all the women menstruate. Some report that
they stopped having periods “long ago”
(difficulties in assessing time, the woman
suggests it may be caused by a growing cyst
and surgery for appendix Woman 8), about 2-3
years ago (the doctor suggested menopauserelated changes, Woman 10), a few months ago
(relates it to the time she started taking
psychotropic medication, Woman 7).
According to two respondents, menstruation
“sometimes comes, sometimes doesn’t”
(Women 3 and 4). The others said they
menstruate regularly. Overall, taking into
account the retrospective assessment of the
women who do not menstruate, menstrual flow
lasts from 3 to 10 days. Giving the exact
number of days was difficult for the
respondents, only two women (Woman 4 and
6) mentioned they recorded the duration of their
period. One of the women in her youth
(Woman 10) was hospitalized due to
amenorrhea and doctors attempted to restore her
menstrual cycle pharmacologically.
Respondents reported abdominal pain,
sometimes very strong, with the need to use
drugs which are not always effective. Bleeding
varies in intensity, some of the women indicated
very intense bleeding (they have to use two
pads at the same time) with blood clots. One of
the women (Woman 1) during period must limit
activity and stay at home due to accompanying
vomiting, abdominal pain and severe bleeding.
Woman 6 has had frequent (as she reports)
hemorrhages for several years but it is not
known whether they are related to her monthly
bleeding. Morphological examinations revealed
numerous abnormalities in the blood, however,
according to the respondent, neither her mother
nor she reported the hemorrhages to the family
doctor. It is tragic in this case that the woman
has never been to a gynecologist – “she is
supposed to go there with her mother soon”.
Another respondent (Woman 5) reported that
her long, abundant period with clots

was commented by the doctor as a symptom of
true femininity: “He said I had a period like a
real woman”. In other respondents their period
was typical with more pronounced initial
bleeding and abdominal pain, which passed
with time. All the women use pads. They have
never used tampons. One woman (Woman 1)
said, “My mother would kill me if she knew
that I was wasting money on it.” She heard
about tampons from her partner, who is
educated by his mother, but is afraid of using
them for fear of not being able to remove the
tampon. The respondents have no difficulty in
using pads, but they do not always buy them on
their own. Sometimes they are supplied with
hygiene products by their mothers or father.
The ability to assess the time of menarche is
difficult for the respondents, who indicated
grade 2, 4, and 8. One woman (Woman 3) said
she was 21. The respondents were not usually
prepared for the first menstrual period, but
remembered that it aroused fear and surprise.
Mothers or guardians at the orphanage (where
Woman 7 was brought up) or the dormitory

(Woman 9) did not even attempt to prepare the
girls for adolescence. One woman (Woman 3)
said that her mother had told her that she would
not be able to go to the swimming pool at that
time. Only one respondent reported that her first
period meet with a positive reaction from her
mother, who emphasized she was “becoming a
woman” (Woman 5). Some respondents
learned about menstruation from a friend that
had already matured in the child care home, at a
dormitory, or at school. One respondent
(Woman 1) talked about it with her sister. Lack
of awareness about the significance of
menstruation is visible among the respondents.
One respondent stated that women menstruate
so that they “do not get pregnant”, presumably
voicing a popular opinion of the possibility of
“safe sex” during menstruation. Only one
woman associates menstruation with fertility
(“To have children”, Woman 11), other women
do not know that, nor have they ever considered
it (“you have it, just because"), treating period as
just another gender-specific characteristic.
During the interview they showed considerable

interest in this issue. In this context, a statement
made by Woman 3 seems quite significant,
“Children come from the abdomen” – the
woman was not able to answer how they get
there in the first place (!).
The respondents do not have a broad
knowledge of the purpose of contraception. One
said that they prevent pregnancy (Woman 9),
another stated they are used “so as not to have
children”. At this point it may be worthwhile to
present some of the respondents’ experiences
related to sexual intercourse. Although no direct
questions were posed in the interview, this
subject was raised by the respondents
themselves. One has a partner, but claims that
they do not have sexual relations (Woman 1);
another two had sexual relations in the past.
Woman 10 in her youth was in a relationship
with a partner with ID and they shared a deep
bond. This relationship was not accepted by her
environment. The couple’s sexual activity
resulted in the woman’s pregnancy and the
child was aborted. The experience of abortion,
which was justified by the carers’ by the fact
that the woman and her partner have epilepsy,
still awakens great negative emotions in the
respondent. This woman was also a victim of
rape. Another respondent (Woman 5) talked
about her behavior many years ago as “drinking
with friends and having sex”, which – as one
might judge from the context – was caused by
lack of family acceptance and psychological
problems. She used condoms at that time.
The respondents, not knowing the use of
contraceptives, were unable to give examples.
One woman mentioned condom, noting that it
was a kind of “balloon” which prevented
pregnancy and adding that she saw one thrown
out on the street (Woman 2); another claimed
that condoms are not a contraceptive (Woman
11). Woman 7 used the term “tablets” and
colloquial “safety” for condoms, knowing that
the former are taken by women and the latter
are used by men. One woman who was asked
about the purpose of contraceptives, explained
that they should be used “during sex”, they can
be purchased at the kiosk, but gave tampon as
an example (Woman 8).
Five respondents use or used hormones
(Women 1, 3, 7, 9 and 10) prescribed by the

gynecologist or endocrinologist, but they were
unable to give their exact name, knowing only
their general use – to regulate their monthly
bleeds. Lack of awareness of one’s own health
situation, but also no control over it, was clearly
evident in one of the subjects who had severe
pain associated with the presence of large cysts.
In the course of the interview, she denied using
contraceptives or hormones to regulate her
menstrual period. At the same time she reported
that she was receiving gynecologic injections
every three months without knowing their name
or use (probably Depo-Provera) (Woman 8).
Her gynecologist is a friend of her aunt. The
psychologist reported that her family arranged
for the use of contraception “just in case”. The
respondent also reported her accidental visit to
another doctor (substitute), expressing
indignation that he was trying to obtain
information about her life. Presumably the
specialist was trying to find justification for
using Depo-Provera which has many side
effects.
The respondents use the services of general
practitioners, and in case of having specific
medical conditions they seek specialist
assistance. Sometimes visits are motivated by
an acute ailment or by the need to obtain a
prescription for long-term control medications.
Most often they visit their doctor alone,
sometimes they also sign up for appointments
on their own.
Two respondents have never been to a
gynecologist (Woman 4 and 6). One, as
abovementioned, has serious problems which
seem to have been ignored by her mother for
years. Another sees no need for gynecological
advice, stating that her mother goes to a
gynecologist. The others report routine or rare
visits, which, as recorded in the interviews,
results from their carers’ attitudes. The declared
motivation to visit a gynecologist are routine
checkups. However, respondents also state
elsewhere that they have infections (“burning”)
and inflammatory states requiring medical
advice. The respondents have a female
gynecologist, and they are strongly opposed to
visiting a male gynecologist. In one case, the
gynecologist is a man chosen by the
respondent’s mother (Woman 3), in another

also a man, but the woman does not have
routine checkups with him (Woman 7). Some
respondents visit their doctor alone, others with
their mother (Woman 10), father, or aunt.
Sometimes the mother and daughter are treated
by the same specialist, who is chosen by the
mother based on her own preferences and
evaluation of service quality. None of the
women feel ashamed during the visits at
present, although in retrospective such a feeling
occurred during the first visit. The examination
usually does not generate negative physical or
mental sensations. In one case, the position on
the chair leads to dizziness and difficulty in
standing up (Woman 1); in another, there is a
strong pain which, according to the respondent,
can result from a specific body structure (“The
doctor told me that I have a very narrow
uterus”, Woman 5). One of the women sits on
the gynecological examination chair with the
help of her mother (Woman 3). Respondents
stated that the information provided by the
gynecologist is understandable to them. The
first visit to a gynecologist was usually
organized by other people, including family
carers (mother, aunt), institutional specialists or
carers from the child care home. The women
were not previously prepared for gynecological
examinations by carers or physicians. Only in
one case did the doctor describe the diagnostic
activities before proceeding with them (Woman 2).
Not all the women have had cytology tests,
but if they had the results were negative. The
respondents are not aware of the usefulness of
such tests, except for Women 5. She also knows
the risk of ovarian and breast cancer due to her
family circumstances. Woman 11, who did not
have cytology tests, pointed to her chest when
she was asked about these tests clearly no
knowing what they were. Asked about the
gynecologist’s breast exam the women
sometimes confirmed they have had them, but
none of the respondents received instructions on
how to carry out breast self-examination at
home. Some only received a general suggestion
to self-exam e.g. in the shower. Neither of the
women conducts this type of self-observation,
saying they do not know how. One of the
respondents reported that her mother asked for a
referral for a mammogram (Woman 10), but the

gynecologist refused stating the daughter was
too young. A 46-year-old respondent asked
about breast-checks replied, “my doctor told me
to go somewhere” (Woman 9). Woman 5, who
had a family history of breast cancer, asked for a
breast cancer test but only received a suggestion
to self-examine at home.
The respondents do not know the term sexually
transmitted diseases, although some could give
examples of HIV and AIDS. One knew of
gonorrhea and explained that it is possible to
“get infected by having sex” (Woman 9).
Another said that “you can get infected during
sex” (Woman 7). One woman declared that
“one sometimes hears things said on television”
and then gives an example: getting cancer due
to air pollution; asked what HIV is, she replies
quickly, “AIDS” (Woman 11). Woman 8 gave
gastrointestinal complaints as an example.
Woman 10 who experienced rape referred to
her own example, indicating that she had been
infected with “a venereal disease.” Awareness
of HIV transmission is relatively better: the
respondents knew that HIV is transmitted via
blood and sexual relations; but they also thought
the stereotypical drinking from one mug or
airborne contact can result in HIV transmission.
One woman said that one way to prevent STDs is
sexual abstinence (Woman 9), another pointed to
the need for using condoms (Woman 7).
Each of the respondents, without exception,
assured that in the course of school education
(primary school) they obtained some
information on sexual health and sexuality. In
no case, however, were they able to specify the
nature of this information. Only some women
stated, also not providing any details, that the
subject was touched on by their mothers. One of
the respondents (Woman 3) declared that she
looked online for information about procreation.
The problem of changes in the body is difficult,
and the terms “organism” and “physical”
(changes) requires additional explanations
during the interviews. The women do not see
these changes, they do not refer to adolescence,
maturation or aging. They rather focus changes
in how active they were in the past and how
their temperament and efficiency have changed
(“I used to be more active”, Woman 11). Most
respondents do not know the term menopause,

but they know it refers to women. Sometimes
they have some associations with it, such as
“you get hot flashes, you don’t have period”
(Woman 11), one feels “hot flushes,
amenorrhea, organism is deregulated” (Woman
9) or that older women experience it.
Knowledge of the subject comes from
conversations with women from the
environment, colleagues, and from television
(advertisement of medication for menopause).

4. Discussion
Generalizing the results of the exploration into
women’s experiences related to their sexual
health it is important to point out that they are in
many ways similar to those obtained by other
authors. Author’s own research confirms low
level of competencies of adult women with ID
as far as dealing with their own health issues is
concerned, visible in poor knowledge of
underlying developmental and gender-specific
phenomena
(puberty,
menstruation,
menopause), potential risks (STDs), and
contraception methods. Similar trends have
been found by other authors. It has been shown
that women with ID do not associate
menstruation with its procreation function, but
some see menstruation as an indicator of female
puberty (Mason & Cunningham, 2008).
Qualitative and quantitative analyzes have
shown that women with intellectual disability
(1) rarely know what menopause is (they do not
know the term), or the changes that are related
to it; (2) have no knowledge about the expected
time of menopause; (3) are not aware of the link
between menopause and fertility; (4) have
limited ability to observe and record changes in
their organisms over time (Chou, Lu & Pu,
2013; McCarthy & Millard, 2003; Willis et al.,
2011).
Other authors confirm that persons with ID
(both sexes) often know the terms or concepts
of HIV and AIDS, but have little knowledge
about the ways HIV is transmitted and the risks
involved (Conod & Servais, 2008; Dawood,
Bhagwanjee, Govender & Chohan, 2006). Still
other authors have found that the knowledge of
people with ID of both sexes in terms of
contraception varies but it is usually selective
and superficial, and it is not accompanied by

specific skills (such as the use or acquisition of
contraceptives). What is well-known is the term
and some of the most common contraceptives
like condoms for men. Very few persons with
ID are aware of other methods of contraception
(Jahoda & Pownall, 2014; Murphy &
O'Callaghan, 2004).
A positive tendency resulting from author’s
own analyses shows the participation of women
in cytology tests which are used to detect
abnormal cervical cells. Many studies reveal
disproportions compared to women in the
general population in that in the case of women
with ID these tests are ignored since these
women are assumed not to engage in sexual
relations (Gribben & Bell, 2010; RamessurMarsden, Huges, Tomlinson & Corfield, 2008
et al., 2008; Rurangirwa et al., 2006). Negative
tendencies are observed in author’s own
explorations of breast examination and selfexamination. Women are not instructed how to
perform these exams. Willis, Kennedy and
Kilbride (2008) write, based on a review of
numerous explorations, that many women with
ID do not have the competencies to do breast
self-examination or understand its meaning, and
so it is the carers who have a decisive role to
play in this respect. Author’s research with
women with ID confirms this conclusion
(Willis, 2016).
Women examined here are aware of their own
state of health in that they notice cyclical
symptoms, disorders and abnormalities to some
extent. However, they find it difficult to
precisely record them, which may be associated
with the specific nature of their disability. They
experience ailments or even serious
disturbances in the functioning of their
organism, which can indicate diseases requiring
advanced therapies (uterine fibroids, polyps,
ovary cysts). Unfortunately, these problems do
not always raise the concern of their carers
(despite the fact that are aware of them) or of the
professionals who examine them. It is difficult
to explain why the problems referred to by
women in the course of menstrual period (such
as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, abundant
bleeding) are not the subject of a detailed
advanced diagnosis. Perhaps women do not
reveal this information to the specialist during

the visits. Periodic abnormalities of monthly
bleeding or excessive bleeding (menorrhagia)
may be more common among women with ID
(Mason & Cunningham, 2008; Rodgers et al.,
2006) due to the medications they take such as
antiepileptic and antipsychotic medication
(Quint, 2008).
The own research included a small group of
women, therefore the results obtained should be
treated with due caution. The issue requires
further research taking into account many
variables, such as the functional status of
women, social environment, the objective
aspects of healthcare (including health care
services available).

5. Conclusions
Women with ID require lifelong support in
meeting their health needs. The competencies
they have acquired at school must be constantly
maintained and strengthened in daily life, so that
they do not fade away. For adult women,
institutions providing social services such as
daily activity centers and occupational therapy
workshops are important. Organizational policy
of these institutions must be geared to the
comprehensive needs of adults, including their
health needs. The support they provide must be
both educational and instrumental. It is
important to monitor the health status of
participants
by:
arranging
individual
conversations (e.g. with a psychologist),
organizing meetings with health service
representatives (e.g. nurses, midwives, sex
therapists), assisting these individuals in signing
up for examinations, and accompanying them
during these appointments. Cooperation with
families is essential. For adult women, issues
related to the correct monthly cycle (e.g.
additional bleeding), symptoms accompanying
menstruation (severe ailments), changes in
breasts (structure, exudation), changes related to
menopause are important. It should be noted
that women with ID are not always aware of
certain abnormalities and do not report them to
the specialist. For some women it may be
important to consider the use of medication to
regulate and perhaps reduce bleeding. It is also
important to bear in mind that women with ID
have sexual needs (of varying intensity) and

tend to pursue them in various forms, such as
masturbation and intercourse. People offering
support, whether on a daily basis or during
various forms of rehabilitation, must be aware
of this to strive for rational support in meeting
these needs – taking into account the best
interests of the person with disability. The task
of health professionals, whom women with ID
have first contact with, is first of all to gain more
in-depth information to take into account not
only the issues that are strictly within their
professional competence. Comprehensive
evaluation will entail: taking into account
women's needs and expectations, motivations
and opportunities e.g. related to various forms
of life activity, including family activity;
identifying experiences relevant from the
perspective of their current behavioral and
functional status; obtaining information on
diseases and disorders (relatively more common
in this population, such as epilepsy), and
prescribed medicines, their side effects and
potential interactions with other drugs.
