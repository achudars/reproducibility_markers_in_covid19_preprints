Abstract
The present study aimed at developing English as a foreign language (EFL) college students’
translation performance through raising their awareness of related syntactic and semantic errors.
During the pilot study, the researcher analyzed fifty translated passages from students'
assignments. The aim of this systematic analysis was necessary to build a list of their most frequent
errors. Besides, a checklist was used to determine students’ level of awareness of these errors. As
a result, a program based on some metacognitive strategies was developed to raise students’
awareness of syntactic and semantic errors to improve their translation performance.
Metacognition awareness went through five stages of preparation, presentation, practice,
evaluation, and expansion. Students worked together in the process of translation to translate the
given passages. They worked in pairs to proofread their translation by identifying their errors,
correcting them, and finally editing their final copy. A pre-post translation test was developed to
assess students’ translation performance. Data obtained from the test was dealt statistically with
SPSS software. The results indicated improvement in students' translation performance.
Key words: error analysis, metacognition awareness raising, metacognitive strategies, syntactic
and semantic awareness, translation performance

Introduction
Achieving Saudi Arabia’s vision 2030 requires a flourishing economy that, in turn needs an
education system aligned with the market needs. The English language as a medium language
between cultures can contribute to the success of this vision (Alzahrani, 2017). Therefore, to meet
the requirements of this vision, more focus is needed to promote English language teaching, and
learning in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), in general, and to develop translation skills, in
particular. This focus is necessary because translation plays a distinguished role in exchanging
information between languages. It enables people to correspond ideas and culture regardless of
their different languages. It enhances global interaction and mutual relationships in various fields
such as the economy, technology, trade, culture, and education.
Translation into English enables learners to use their linguistic competence in producing
target text. It reflects their competency in foreign languages. So, it can be used as a method for
assessing English language learners' linguistic and communicative knowledge. Due to its
importance, translation as a course is taught at the university level in language departments all
over the world. It is a course that is incorporated in almost all study plans in colleges of education
in KSA. In spite of its importance, translation is a complicated process. It requires a thorough
knowledge of the source, and the target language such as their syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic
features (Zengin, & Kacar, 2011). The process of translation incorporates problem-solving
procedures because students face some problems during interpreting, decoding, and using
equivalents in the target language. Translation can begin with challenges, for example, diction,
grammar, construction and, cultural habits. Differences between languages in translation motivate
students to solve semantics, syntactic or pragmatic problems (Yingxue, 2013). That is to say, in
the process of translation, students can face some barriers or difficulties and problems. Such
problems could result in frequent errors in translation in the word level, sentence level, and the
whole textual levels (Kásroly, 2012). Some researchers suggest teaching students some translation
strategies to facilitate their process of translation (Aly, 2004; Abd-Elshaheed, 2012; Nasr El-Din,
2010).
On the other hand, some researchers confirm the importance of conscious –raising in the
frequent errors made by foreign language learners to help them correct these inaccuracies. When
applied to translation, it results in producing an error-free product. To achieve this competency and
proficiency in translation, researchers have studied and analyzed the causes of errors made by
second or foreign learners due to the complexity or difficulties in the source or the target language.
For example, (Studies of Adrienn, 2012; Al Karazoun, 2016; Na, 2005; Zaho, 2013). It is
suggested to raise students’ awareness of their errors to avoid them.
Among the suggested methods of awareness raising in aspects of language learning is the
use of metacognitive strategies in language learning. Metacognition consists of the learners'
understanding of their knowledge, and thinking processes. It also includes their ability to regulate
their learning (Chamot, 2007). Metacognition strategies have aspects of awareness raising, namely
executive management strategies, which can be achieved using some metacognitive strategies such
as planning and organization, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation (Hartman, 2001a). Researchers
confirm that teaching student these strategies result in better performance and achievements in
their learning. In the field of translation, Studies of Echeverri (2015) and Yanqun (2015) conclude
that metacognitive strategies improve students' translation competencies and performance.

Some researchers emphasize the importance of applying the metacognitive approach to
error analysis that postulates consciousness-raising, awareness of error source and adopting an
active approach to error correction (Hernández, 2001; O’Brien, 2015; Schraw, 2001; Umale, 2011).
Applied to translation, metacognition monitoring and regulating one’s errors in syntactic and
semantic can lead to improvement in their translation (Abbasi & Karimnia, 2014; Prior, Kroll &
Macwhinney, 2013; Utomo, 2016).
1. Research problem and hypotheses
Success in the translation course is one of the requirements for graduation from the English
language department in Zulfi College of education, Majmaah University. Among the objectives of
this course is to enable the students to produce error-free copies of translation on the word level,
sentence level, and textual level. The pilot study results revealed that the students had frequent
syntactic and semantic errors in translation. Moreover, they suffered from a lack of awareness of
these errors (see the section of results for more details). Therefore, the present study tried to teach
the students some metacognitive strategies to help them identify their frequent semantic and
syntactic errors in translation and then providing them with feedback to raise their awareness of
these errors. These procedures were necessary to help them self-correct their errors and thus
develop their translation performance. To achieve this goal, students worked together in the
process of translation in class and then completed their work via Google apps to proofread and edit
their translation assignments. Hence, the study proposes the following hypotheses:
1. There are statistically significant differences between the means of the pretest and the post-test
in translation performance in favor of the latter.
2. There are statistically significant differences between the means of the pretest and the post-test
on syntactic features in translation performance in favor of the latter.
3. There are statistically significant differences between the means of the pretest and the post-test
on semantic features in translation performance in favor of the latter.
2. Literature review
4.1 Teaching Translation
Translation is not only seen as a tool to develop foreign language competence and skills
but also as a valuable and applied skill. Having translation skills can enhance learners’ level in the
language. Many theorists and educators agree on the importance of using translation activities in
foreign language learning since it has beneficial effects to increase vocabulary knowledge, to
develop writing performance and to enhance thinking skills (Károly, 2014; Mateo, 2015).
Due to its importance, translation pedagogy has been a subject of interest on behaves of
researchers. Traditionally, translation pedagogy has been both prescriptive and product-oriented.
Recently, researchers have proven that the best way to improve learners' translation performance
is by recognizing how they produced the target text, i.e., by understanding the translation process.
This tendency is referred to as the process-oriented translation approach. This approach is learnercentered and needs-based. It includes problem-solving methodologies involving a collaborative
approach between teachers and learners or among learners themselves (Fox, 2000; Shreve, 2011).

"The translation process encompasses the thought process that is intended to solve a
problem or make a relevant correction to change the source text to the target text" (Hansen, 2003,
P. 26). Translation involves different types of problems. These problems are mainly linguistic
ones, i.e., syntactical or grammatical, lexical or semantical and phonological (Enani, 2001;
Teleiba, 2004) and pragmatic or cultural (DiFranco, 2000; Ghazala, 2012; Robinson, 2003).
Consequently, they are the principal sources of difficulties and errors in the translation process.
4.2 Difficulties, problems and errors in translation
Some of the students’ difficulty to translate may result from obstacles in the translation
process itself. Among these obstacles are lack of comprehension of the text and shortage of
available resources to look up for vocabularies, and new expressions and idioms; besides, the
inability to identify their problems in translation and find possible compensation strategies, or
difficulties in the production of the target language e.g. finding appropriate vocabularies, idioms,
structures, grammar or equivalent cultural substitutions. All these elements result in
multidimensional errors in translation (Debboune & Tebib, 2010; Solano-Flores, et al., 2009).
Analyzing errors enables teachers to understand the thinking process that the student is
utilizing. Recognizing the reasons and sources for errors help teachers to focus on these aspects,
and if the students are aware of them, they are introduced to the concept of metacognition.
Syntactic awareness means the ability to understand the grammatical structures of language within
sentences. If students are unaware of these grammatical structures and their correct use within
sentences, they are likely to have errors in the writings. Therefore, it is necessary to teach the
students to rectify some of the fossilized grammatical or syntactical errors (O’Brien, 2015).
Syntactic awareness in translation results in producing an accepted translation in the target
language. Semantic awareness means being aware of the potential and appropriate meaning along
with its implication in a given context. Semantically, a single word can have more than one
meaning. Errors in translating a meaning may result from uncertainty in synonymy, polysemy,
homography, homophony, and homonymy and morphological ambiguity (Prior, et al., 2013).
Errors are significant in three ways as they tell the teacher what needs to be emphasized,
how language learning progresses, and what prerequisites have to be achieved (James, 2013).
Therefore, some previous studies in translation have been conducted in this respect. For instance,
Na (2005) identifies the errors in the translation of topic-comment structures.. Adrienn (2012)
reveals the recurring patterns of lexical, syntactic and textual errors in translations from English
into Hungarian. Zaho (2013) investigates the reasons behind some errors in students EnglishChinese translation by analyzing their mistakes in idiomatic usage, and the lack of knowledge in
the cultural background. Ardeshiri and Zarafshan (2014) found that understanding the pragmatic
aspects was the most frequent problem in translating from English into Persian. Al Karazoun
(2016) concludes that linguistic errors of EFL students in translation are grammatical, discourse
and lexical ones. Utomo (2016) classifies students' grammatical translation errors as those of
omission, addition, selection, and ordering. Wongranu (2017) reports that students have syntactical
and semantic errors in translation. All these studies agree on the importance of identifying the
reasons behind students’ errors in translation. They suggest teaching foreign learners some
strategies or techniques to correct their errors. Moreover, it is recommended to raise students’
awareness of their frequent errors in translation to avoid such types of errors.

Using Awareness Raising in Syntactic and Semantic Errors to Foster Translation

Errors in translation can be successfully addressed by different strategies that can be used
to solve various problems. Thus, translation strategies can be defined as potentially conscious plans
for solving the translation problem. They can be forms of explicitly textual manipulation. For
Chesterman (2016), they describe text-linguistic behaviors. They refer to the operation that a
translator carries out during the formulation of the target text. They should be goal-oriented and
problem-centered as well. In the translation process, some texts are translated without any
problems and others that need application of strategies (Dimitrova, 2005). Munday (2016) outlines
a taxonomy of translation strategies which includes comprehension, production, training, problemsolving, survival strategies and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive strategies develop
students' metacognition about translation and are used to overcome translation errors.
4.3 Translation and metacognition
Two types of metacognition are executive management strategies such as planning,
monitoring and evaluation, and strategic declarative, contextual and procedural knowledge about
their use (Hartman, 2001b). Metacognition includes aspects of awareness raising that can be
achieved through the use of some metacognitive strategies such as self-monitoring, self-evaluation,
planning and organization, and self-regulation (Chamot & Robbins, 2006; Crawford Saul,
Mathews, & Makinster, 2005). Teaching the students these strategies helps them to be strategic
learners. Those learners know how, when and why to use strategies, and are willing to learn much
more about other ones. Furthermore, learners who use learning strategies have good achievements
in their language learning (Beckman, 2002; Cohen, 2007).
Metacognitive strategies play significant roles in the language learning process since they
help students become autonomous and self-regulated learners. As for the translation performance,
monitoring and regulating one’s errors in syntactic and semantic can lead to improvement in their
translation achievement (Ardeshiri & Zarafshan, 2014). Angelone (2010) reports metacognitive
strategy use at the textual level, behavioral level (problem recognition and its proposed solution
and evaluation) and the locus of translation activity (comprehension, transfer, and production).
Echeverri (2015) concludes that metacognition helps the students to become more responsible for
their learning and consequently develops their translation performance. The study of Yanqun
(2015) proposes a model of metacognition, and the results indicated a development in students'
translation competencies by monitoring, regulating, and reflecting on the performance.
Metacognition strategies aim at solving translation problems to enable the students avoids
errors in translation. These errors have been the subject of research in the field of applied
linguistics and teaching methodology. To develop translation competency, it is necessary to
consciously identify related errors and then determine the most appropriate solution for them.
These steps are beneficial because the analysis of students’ errors has advantages in the process of
learning translation (Schaffner & Adab, 2000).
To sum up, this study focused on syntactic and semantic errors in translation. Its aim was
raising students’ awareness of their errors, i.e., their cause, and their method of correction to
develop their translation performance. Translation performance in this study referred to students'
ability to produce and transfer an acceptable and equivalent meaning in the target language
(TL)with accuracy in selecting appropriate lexicon-grammatical items, words, tenses, linguistic

markers, cohesive devices and, sentence structure and style to achieve a balance between source
text (ST) and target text (TT) . These objectives could be achieved by teaching the students some
metacognitive strategies in translation. The context of the study utilized Google apps to facilitate
students' work in translation. They worked collaboratively in groups through Google Docs to
translate, edit and proofread their translation.
3. Methods
5.1 Participants
The participants of the present study were the 4th level (n= 48, Mean age = 18.5 years)
female students enrolled at Introduction to Translation course ENG224. In the first semester
1439/1440 H, at the English language department, Zulfi College of Education, Majmaah
University, KSA. They almost had the same level of proficiency in English according to their
GPA, and their native language is Arabic. All the participants completed 128 credit hours of study
in their study plan.
5.2 Research Design
This study adopted one group pre-posttest design.
5.3 Instruments
The instruments of the study included:
5.3.1. A translation test
This test aims to measure students' translation performance and their ability to avoid related
syntactic and semantic errors. The test is divided into two sections. The first one includes twenty
sentences that have syntactic and semantic difficulties from English into Arabic and vice versa. It
is assumed that errors may occur because of such difficulties. Its total score is 40 marks. The
second section consists of two short passages to translate into the target language. Thirty marks
are assigned for each one to make a total out of 60 marks. Thus, the overall score of the test is 100
marks. The sentences and the passages used are from (Enani, 2005a; Ghazala, 2012).
5.3.2 A translation rubric for scoring the translation test.
The rubric measures two aspects of translation performance: the semantic – and syntactic
features. The semantic ones are divided into three components: comprehension of the ST, transfer
of meaning in the TT, and finding equivalents. The syntactic features include three criteria:
sentence structure, grammar & style, and using equivalent lexical and functional categories. The
total score of the rubric is 60 scores, 30 marks for each feature with a range of scores from 5 to 0
for every component. The rubric is based on Khanmohammad and Osanloo's Translation
Assessment Rubric (2009, pp. 146-149) with some modifications and changes in division and
description of items and scores.
5.3.3 The validity and reliability
Specialists in TEFL assigned the validity of the translation test. Some modifications were
made according to their suggestions. The test-retest method was estimated to determine the
reliability of the test. The correlation between the two applications was (0.79) which is significant
at 0.01 level which means that the test is reliable.

The reliability of the translation rubric was measured by using inter-rater reliability. The
Pearson correlation between the two scorers was (0.75) which is significant at 0.01level.
5.4 The procedures
A Pilot study was conducted by applying a content analysis of 50 translated texts to identify
the most frequent syntactic and semantic errors in translation from Arabic to English and vice
versa. As a result, a list of these errors was developed, and then an awareness checklist was applied
to check students' awareness of them.
5.4.1 Error analyses
Two raters identified the errors to avoid any bias in counting them. The Pearson correlation
coefficient was (r = 0.90) at 0.01 level. Categorization of errors, frequency, percentage, and rank
are represented in Table 1.

Table 1 presents the most common errors in translation. They include seven syntactical
errors and eight semantic ones. As for syntactic errors, the most frequent one is sentence structure
errors (26.1%). The rank shows the descending order of all of them. The majority of the students
have semantic errors in direct translation from Arabic, collocation choice, translating metaphors
and expressions, use of synonymy, polysemy, and monosemy, word choice, selection of prefixes
and suffixes in the TL, wordy sentences, borrowing and coinage with percentages of 14.6, 14.1,
11.4, 10.6, 9.7, 8.9, and 7.1, respectively.
5.4.2 The list of syntactic and semantic errors
The list is based on frequent errors identified by the content analysis of students TT. It
consists of fifteen syntactic and semantic errors. It was submitted to specialists in linguistics and
TEFL (n= 10) to determine its validity.
5.4.3 A syntactic and semantic error awareness checklist
The checklist aims to determine students’ level of awareness in syntactic and semantic
errors. It consists of 20 items. The first ten sentences are translated into English, but the other ten
ones are translated into Arabic. Each group of sentences is divided equally to include five
syntactical errors and five semantic ones. Students were given a score of 3 on each sentence based
on their identification of the error, giving a reason for that error, and correcting it. One point was
assigned for each one. The total score of the checklist was 60 marks.

As shown in Table 2 the checklist was applied to a group of 60 students. The mean score
for syntactic error is (14.39), and it is (11.23) for semantic errors. These means are lower than that
of the checklist. This result indicates that before the experiment, the students lack awareness of
the identified syntactic and semantic errors in translation.
5.4.4 The treatment
The present study lasted for 13 weeks during the first semester of the academic year 20182019. Table 3 shows the duration of the treatment. During the first week, the translation pre-test
was applied to the study sample. The implementation of the program lasted for ten weeks. The
introductory session was conducted in the second week. The third to the seventh weeks covered
the syntactical errors in translation. The semantic errors in translation sessions were presented
through the eighth to the eleventh weeks. An evaluation session was conducted in the twelfth week.
The last week of the treatment was assigned to the post-test.

5.4.4.1 Program description
An awareness- raising of syntactic and semantic errors in translation program was
developed by the author of the study. This remedial program aims to improve students' translation
skills by training them in using some metacognitive strategies to raise their awareness of syntactic
and semantic errors in translation. The program consisted of ten sessions. Each session went
through five stages of metacognitive strategy training to raise students' awareness of syntactic and
semantic errors in translation and consequently develop their translation skills. The five stages
were preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and expansion. Metacognitive strategies
included three components: planning, monitoring, and evaluation.
5.4.4.1.a Before translation
Preparation stage
In this stage, the teacher checked the students' prior knowledge about the related syntactic
or semantic rule that might cause an error in translation. This step could be done by presenting
some sentences with syntactic or semantic errors and asking the students to detect and explain the
reason behind such errors. Finally, the teacher asked them about the strategies they could use to
correct these sentences to produce a good translation.
Presentation stage
The teacher introduced two sentences and two version of translation for each one. One
was an appropriate translation, and the other contained syntactic or semantic errors in translation.
Besides, the teacher explained how and why to use planning, and monitoring strategies. Teacher
modeled with thinking –aloud protocol how to detect the errors, explain the reasons for them and
how to correct these errors to produce an acceptable translation.
5.4.4.1.b During translation
Practice stage
In this stage, students planed for their translation. First, they used advance organization
strategy to skim the sentences or the text to be translated. Then they utilized advance preparation
strategy by rehearsing the language needed for translating the given sentences into the target
language. Next, students employed selective attention strategy to attend for words, idioms, and
linguistic markers needed to perform the translation task.
Finally, students applied production-monitoring strategy by checking and correcting their
translation. During this step, they worked in pairs to proofread their translation by identifying their
errors, correcting them, and finally editing their final copy of the translation.

5.4.4.1. c After translation
In the evaluation stage
Students used an evaluation checklist to evaluate their translation process and their use of
metacognitive strategies. They also wrote a notice about the errors they had done in their
translation and how they corrected them. They should understand what the error was, what the
reason was for it and how to correct it.
In the expansion stage
Students were given other translation assignments to translate some sentences and short
passages collaboratively via Google Docs. Students were asked to comment and write the errors if
they found them and correct them in the comment box in Google Docs.
5.4.4.2 Activities and tasks of the program
The translation exercises are adapted from the students' textbook "Translation as problems
and solution" by Ghazala (2012). Further exercises are used from "Translation Manual" by Enani
(2005a), and "The Science of Translation an introduction, with reference to Arabic-English and
English-Arabic translation" by Enani, (2005b).

Results of Table 6 show that the mean of the post-test is higher than that of the pretest (8.45) on
the semantic features of translation. Thus, the third hypothesis is accepted.

Discussion
The findings of this study are in line with Angelone (2010) Abbasi and Karimnia (2011) ,
Al Karazoun, (2016), Echeverri (2015) Yanqun (2015) and Utomo (2016). The results of the
posttest affirmed the hypotheses of the study. Identifying and analyzing syntactic and semantic
errors in translation helped to focus on the points of weakness and trying to overcome them. The
sessions of the proposed program of the study were directed to cover the most frequent errors in
translation as identified by the results of the pilot study, Tables 1 & 2. All the errors that were
classified in Table 2 could be categorized in a more broad classification of deletion, addition,
improper selection, and formation. The same classification was utilized in the study of Utomo
(2016). The results of Table 3 showed that the students before the treatment had little awareness
of such errors.
Most of the errors were due to the interference between the first and the target language.
Other errors were because of the students' insufficient mastery of the target language. In other
words, there were two causes of students' errors. First, the intralingual errors those were due to
interface between Arabic and English. Second, the interlingual errors that resulted from students'
inadequate proficiency level in the target language. This result is supported by the findings of AlShormani and Al-Sohbani (2012) and Ngangbam (2016). Similar to the results of Aly (2004),
students in this study had more errors in semantics rather than in grammar and sentence structures.
On the contrary, the participants in Al Karazoun's research (2016) had more grammatical errors in
translation followed by lexical and discourse errors. The findings of Wongranu (2017) showed that
the students had more frequent and prominent syntactical errors than semantic ones in translation.
Addressing these errors by raising students' awareness of them helped to improve their
translation proficiency and consequently their translation performance. Thus, the first hypothesis
is confirmed as indicated in Table 4. This result is consistent with Mateo (2015) who proved the
effectiveness of metacognition awareness of the occurrence of calques by studying cross-linguistic
differences and similarities between students' native language and the TL in producing an accepted
translation. El-banna and Naeem (2016) employed a translation common error remedial program

Using Awareness Raising in Syntactic and Semantic Errors to Foster Translation

to help students avoid syntactic, semantic and pragmatic errors in translation from English into
Arabic. Other previous studies also have emphasized the importance of error analysis in
developing students' translation performance such as Abbasi and Karimni, (2011), Al Karazoun
(2016), Utomo (2016) and Wongranu (2017). Thus, when the students become aware of the
reasons and sources of their errors and how to correct them, their metacognition awareness is
developed (O'Brien, 2015).
Using metacognitive strategies resulted in metacognition awareness raising in syntactic and
semantic errors. Before translation, students used advance organization and selective attention
strategies. During the translation process, students used production-monitoring strategy. After
translation, they used self-evaluation strategy. Therefore, Students' improvement in translation was
due to training them to use these strategies during the translation process. In other words, helping
the students to use these executive management strategies raised their awareness of their
translation errors, and consequently, they avoided them, and then their translation performance
improved. Translation performance was reflected in the students' ability to produce and transfer
an acceptable and equivalent meaning in the TL with accuracy, to some extent, in the syntactic
and semantic levels. This result confirms the second and the third hypotheses of the study as shown
in Tables 5 & 6.
Similarly, previous studies affirmed the effectiveness of using metacognitive strategies in
improving translation performance. For example, Shreve (2006) pinpointed that expertise in
translation is correlated with translators' metacognition. Bergon (2009) proved the role of
metacognition in developing translation competence. The exploratory study of Angelone (2010)
concluded that successful students used metacognitive strategies during all the levels of translation.
The results of Echeverri (2015) and Yanqun (2015) showed that metacognitive strategies improved
students' translation performance. On the contrary, the results of the present study are not in line
with Shabani-Jadidi (2004) who found no significant differences in pre-post test results on the
conscious raising of metacognitive strategies and students' abilities in translation.
The suggested program of this study is learner-centered and needs based. It followed the
process approach towards translation that helped the systematic manipulation of students' errors.
The sessions of the program went through three stages: before, during, and after translation.
Besides, each stage was divided into one or two phases according to Chamot's (2007) model for
teaching strategies. These phases were preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and
expansion. During each phase, the teacher trained the students on using metacognitive strategies
to raise their awareness in translation errors to avoid and correct them in their final product of
translation. Fox (2000) supported the use of the process approach in translation. The study of
Amirian and Baghiat (2013) explained how the translation process is considered a metacognitive
activity and they suggested developing metacognitive activities to develop translation among
translators. Moreover, using metacognitive models in translation is suggested by the study of
Yanqun (2015). Therefore, these studies are compatible with the present study.
The translation process was facilitated through the collaborative work in the stage of
editing and proofreading the final product of translation. The program of the present study put into
consideration the advantages of web2.0 tools, so students utilized Google Docs to edit their

translation together and to work collaboratively on their assignments. Writing comments and
providing feedback on Google Docs helped to promote students' metacognitive awareness of their
errors. Cooperative learning has also been found to activate metacognition as reported by the
related study of Hernández (2001). In his research, students' awareness of grammatical and lexical
errors was raised via Email.
Although the participants' overall performance in translation has improved, some of them
still have errors in translation. The explanation of this result is compatible with the study of Shreve
(2011) who pinpointed that translation has levels of comprehension, transfer, and production, and
so errors can occur at any level of them. On the word level, few errors appeared in spelling or
lexical choice. Those students showed errors on the sentence level such as sentence structure and
fragments, and punctuation marks. On the paragraph level, the most frequent errors were related
to the cohesive device and coordinate conjunctions. Those students had interlingual errors that
were related to inadequacies in the target language. Therefore, it is recommended to have remedial
programs in writing skills to those students. In translating into Arabic, students confused different
forms of plural for two or more objects, especially with feminine and masculine ones. Other
students had performance problems and errors in translation that were due to interference between
L1 and the target language. Those intralingual errors need more practice to avoid them. This result
is consistent with Ngangbam (2016) who concluded that students' syntactical errors were caused
by mother-tongue interference. Another reason for their persistence errors was the direct
translation from the Arabic language into English. This result supports the findings of Al-Shormani
& Al-Sohbani (2012).
7. Conclusions, recommendations, and suggestions
Based on the findings of the study, raising students' awareness of their syntactic and
semantic errors in translation resulted in enhancing their translation performance. Besides,
developing metacognition awareness about errors developed their translation competencies and
performance. Metacognition awareness raising in errors is better achieved through using
metacognitive strategies. Enhancing translation performance by raising awareness of related errors
went through aspects of metacognition. In the declarative knowledge level, students knew the
causes of errors and how to correct them. In the procedural knowledge level, students applied the
rules to correct their errors. In the production level, the students produced accepted translation by
using executive management strategies. Collaborative work and following the process approach
in translation are other causes for improving students' translation skills.
It is suggested for teachers to analyze and identify their students' errors in translation and
adjust their methods of teaching accordingly. Teachers should put into consideration the necessity
for metacognition awareness raising in syntactic and semantic errors in translation to improve their
students' translation performance. Therefore, metacognitive strategies should be integrated into
translation courses. It is also recommended to incorporate in translation course books a chapter or
more exercises for editing skills, in both the first and the target language, to avoid errors in the
transferring and production levels of translation. Translation courses should be learner and needsbased to address learners' needs and improve their translation performance accordingly.

Using Awareness Raising in Syntactic and Semantic Errors to Foster Translation

Amin

This study was limited to syntactic and semantic errors in translation. Further studies need
to study awareness of pragmatic errors and its related effect on translation proficiency. Other
studies may suggest programs to raise students' awareness of the differences and similarities
between the FL and the TL to overcome calques in translation. It is also suggested to examine
whether gender difference may affect students' awareness of translation errors. The effectiveness
of syntactic and semantic awareness raising in writing skills or speaking skills can be a further
field for other studies. This study can be duplicated with other population to verify the results.
