Do Climate Changes Lead to Income Inequality? Empirical Study on the
Farming Community in Malaysia
Abstract
Changes in climatic factors have different impacts on different social groups. But the farmers
are considered to be the most vulnerable group because of their direct and indirect
dependency on climatic factors. This study aims to understand the nature of socioeconomic
impacts of climatic changes on the farmers in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was
conducted on a sample of 198 paddy farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development
Area at North-West Selangor of Malaysia in 2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive
statistics, ordinal scale and percentile. The study reveals that climatic changes have adverse
impacts on agricultural productivity, profitability, income equality, employment, farmer’s
health, and government subsidy policy. The Kuznets ratio and Gini coefficient indicate that
there is highly unequal distribution of income. Climatic changes are contributing to the
widening of this income gap, because poor farmers are affected more by the adverse effects
of climatic changes. The current government subsidy policy is not found appropriate and
adequate to support and encourage the farmers to adequately adapt to the climatic changes
and to reduce the inequality among the farming community. The paper ends up with
recommending some policy guidelines to counter adverse effects of climate change on
income of paddy farmers in Malaysia.

INTRODUCTION
Climate is expressed and described by the factors like the amount of rainfall, sunshine hours,
temperature, relative humidity and length of flood or drought periods. The impacts of climate
change are not limited to any geographical boundary or timeframe. Some of the aspects are
long term and related to national or international security such as, soil erosion, chemical
poisoning or nuclear waste (Daly and Cobb 1990), and some issues are related to daily
quality of life such as water pollution, shortage of food or resources (Homer-Dixon 1992).
Climate change, therefore, affects various areas, sectors and stakeholders in various ways
(Klein et al. 2005; Siwar 2009).
Since agriculture is heavily dependent on climatic conditions, changes in the climatic factors
result in year-to-year and area-to-area variability of crop production which largely affects the
social and economic sustainability of the farmers. Several variables influence climate change
that, in turn, leads to changes in the variables of agricultural sustainability and their impacts
on the agricultural system and socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers. Due to the
changes in climate factors, the factors relevant to agricultural sustainability, such as
volume/yield, area and value of production, also change. Vulnerable agricultural
sustainability may result in inconsistency in total production quantity, profit margin of crops,
profit margin of final goods, profit margin of production and import, farm and off-farm wage
rate and so on.

Accordingly the adverse climatic change leads to decline in farmers’ income which is likely
to trigger poverty. Moreover, climate change causes frequent natural disasters and
consequently fulltime farmers become unemployed in a major time of the year. The
unexpected behavior of climate factors may also cause disease, disability, frequent sickness
and other health hazards to the farmers which, in turn, lead to long unemployment periods.
Overall, climate change influences the agricultural sustainability negatively in Malaysia; as a
consequence people who are dependent on agriculture are more vulnerable in terms of
socioeconomic perspective than other social groups in Malaysia (Alam et al. 2010b). Even
within the farming community, climatic changes are contributing to the widening of this
income gap, because poor farmers are affected more by the adverse effects of climatic
changes (Alam et al. 2011).
Impacts of climate change on agriculture vary from period to period, from area to area and
from country to country based on economic, social, political, and environmental condition of
the locality. Like other countries in this region, climate change has adversely affected
agriculture in a variety of ways in different parts of Malaysia. Its fisheries, forestry and
livestock and crop cultivations have been seriously affected by the climate change. This
empirical paper investigates the direct impacts of climate change on farmers and analyses the
nature and magnitude of socio-economic impacts of the climate change on farmers, especially
the issue of inequality among the farming community in Malaysia.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
This study relies on primary data from a research project entitled “the economics of climate
change: economic dimensions of climate change, impacts and adaptation practices in
agriculture sector: case of paddy sector in Malaysia”, conducted by the Institute for
Environment and Development (LESTARI) of the National University of Malaysia (UKM)
funded by Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment of the Government of Malaysia
(Alam et al. 2010a). Data were collected through a sample survey of paddy producing
farmers in the eight sections of the Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA) of
North-West Selangor, Malaysia. Total paddy irrigated area is 18,980 ha, with the additional
625 ha being used for drainage. There are a total of 10,300 paddy farmers and 30,000 other
crops producers. The total size of the agricultural community is 50,000.
The target group of the survey was paddy producing farmers. The survey was conducted by
regular enumerators of the IADA authority using a structured questionnaire under the direct
supervision of IADA officials. A total of 198 respondents were selected using stratified
random sampling based on the size of the irrigated land area and locality. Details of
socioeconomic profiles of the respondents are available at Alam et al. (2010a). Finally, the
study uses the descriptive statistics, percentile and scale analysis to assess other factors of
socioeconomic sustainability and adaptability of farmers to climate change.
IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AGRICULTURE IN MALAYSIA
The temperature in Malaysia is projected to rise by 0.3oC to 4.5oC due to high greenhouse gas
emissions the temperature. Warmer temperature will cause sea level to rise about 95cm over
a hundred year-period. The changes in rainfall may fluctuate from about -30% to +30% (NRS
2001). This change is projected to reduce crop yield and cause drought in many areas and
cultivation of some crops such as rubber, oil palm and cocoa may not be any more possible.

Another projection shows that maximum monthly precipitation will increase up to 51% in the
states of Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu, while the minimum precipitation will decrease
ranging from 32% to 61% all over Peninsular Malaysia (NAHRIM 2006). However, the
annual rainfall will increase up to 10% in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and North West
Coast, and decrease up to 5% in Selangor and Johor. This variation of climatic factors will
make the agricultural system vulnerable.
Temperature above 25oC may cause decline in grain mass and grain yield (Tashiro and
Wardlaw 1989; Baker and Allen 1993). The average temperature in rice growing areas of
Malaysia is about 26oC. The actual farm yield of paddy in Malaysia varies from 3-5 tons per
hectare as against the potential yield of 7.2 tons (Singh et al. 1996). Singh et al. (1996) also
mentioned that a decline of rice yield between 4.6%-6.1% per 1oC temperature increase under
the present CO2 level. A study found that a 1% increase in temperature leads to 3.44%
decrease in current paddy yield, and .03% decrease in paddy yield in next season and a 1%
increase in rainfall leads to .12% decrease in current paddy yield, and .21% decrease of paddy
yield in next season (Alam et al. 2014).
Tisdell (1996) reports that rainfall variability increases the level of environmental stress that
affects the capability of the system to maintain productivity. Projection (NRS 2001) shows
that given the CO2 (ppm) as 400 and variation in temperature as 0.30C and above, variation of
rainfall by more than 0.4% by the year of 2020 will cause reduction in paddy production and
earnings of farmers (Table 1). Total yearly rainfall in Malaysia is increasing and its monthly
variation is too high (Alam et al. 2010a). The effect of lower rainfall can be checked through
proper irrigation system, but the opposite phenomenon of over rainfall for any particular
time, especially at the end of the crop cycle or at the maturity period that causes serious
damages to crops, is absolutely uncontrollable.
Insert Table 1 about here
Total yearly rainfall in Malaysia is increasing but its monthly variation is too high. The most
vulnerable states in terms of fluctuation in rainfall and temperature are Sabah, Terengganu,
Kelantan, Sarawak, Kedah, Perlis, and Perak (NAHRIM 2006). The effect of lower rainfall
can be somehow controlled through introduction of proper irrigation system. But the problem
of over rainfall at any particular time is not controllable. Excess rainfall especially at the end
of the crop cycle or at the maturity period, causes serious damages to crops. The most
vulnerable group of people are the poor and hard-core poor engaged in agricultural activities
and having relatively larger number of household members (NRS 2001). Since these farmers
are dependent on agriculture, their family income declines with the decline in agricultural
productivity and production. Change in climatic factors, therefore, affect directly and
indirectly the social and economic sustainability of the farmers. Climatic changes cause crop
damages leading to low productivity and high production cost, income losses to farmers,
increase in seasonal unemployment rate, and increase in poverty level.
Upon realization of this problem, the Second National Agricultural Policy (1992-1997) was
revised in 1998 and the Third National Agricultural Policy (1998-2010) was designed based
on a vision of development of a dynamic agricultural sector focusing on an efficient marketled competitive growth. The principal aim of the Third National Agricultural Policy (19982010) is to maximize income of the stakeholders through optimal utilization of resources.
NATURE AND INTENSITY OF INEQUALITY AMONG FARMERS

Difference in Social Characteristics
Demography
According to the records of IADA, the distribution of ethnic groups among the farming
community is 65 percent Malay, 22 percent Chinese and 13 percent Indian, whereas the
survey covered distribution for this study is 89.9 percent Malay and 10.1 percent Chinese.
There are few strong reasons behind this asymmetrical distribution of sample with respect to
race. The survey is clustered based on area rather than ethnicity. Within a geographical
location, the survey is conducted randomly, but geographically in most cases the same race
groups stay together and their localized distributions are not same at all. In terms of gender,
the distribution of sample is 9.6% females and 90.4% males. Among the Chinese group only
male farmers are available in the survey and among the Malay group the proportion of female
farmers is almost the same for all locations. The average age of all farmers is 52.9 years
where that of males is 52.9 years and that of females is 53.5 years old. Among the female
farmers, minimum age is 25 years and maximum is 75 years old. Among the male farmers,
minimum age is 27 years and maximum is 84 years old. In total, only 8.5% farmers are below
40 years old, 18.2% are above 60 years old and rest 62.1% is between 40 to 60 years old.
Most of the farmers have basic primary education (47.5%) followed by secondary education
(42.9%). Only 4% farmers have tertiary education and 3.5% have no education. 93% of the
total respondents are married where 3% are unmarried. Among the women farmers, 42.1%
are widows. The study reports that 29.3% of the families have three members, 52% have four
to six members and 18.7% have more than six members in each family.
Earning Family Members
Among the household of farming community, 89.9 percent have only one earning member,
8.6 percent have two earning members, and 1.5 percent have three and above earning family
members. Among 89.9 percent households having only one earning family member, 91.2
percent have no other activities except agricultural activities.
Earnings Ratio and Dependency Ratio
At the household level, the earning family members to total family members ratio is 0.294,
indicating only 29.4 percent of family members are engaged in economic activities. However,
at household level, dependent family members to earning family members ratio is 3.52,
meaning one earning person needs to bear expenses of other 3.52 persons, and total 4.52
persons including himself. It also means that the burden rate for each earning member is 352
percent. The dependency ratio highly varies among households (standard deviation is 2.09).
The range of this dependency ratio is minimum 0 to maximum 11 times.
Occupation
Agriculture is the main occupation of 88.4 percent and supplementary occupation of 8.6
percent heads of household in farmers’ community. In addition, agriculture is the main
occupation of 3.5 percent and supplementary occupation of 1 percent spouse of household
heads in farmers’ community. At the household level, 80.3 percent households have no other
occupation except farming, which means 80.3 percent farming households are fully
dependent on agriculture.
Differences in Physical Assets
Home Ownership

Among the farming community, 99 percent of the farmers have their own residences. This
means farmers are stable in terms of having permanent address and staying place.
Types and Status of Residence
In total, 29.8 percent of farmers’ houses are made of brick, 48 percent are made of both brick
and wood, and 22.2 percent are made of wood. Among the Chinese farmers, 45 percent have
brick made houses, 30 percent have brick and wood mixed houses, and 25 percent have wood
made houses. Among the Malay farmers, 28 percent have brick made houses, 53.3 percent
have mixed houses, and 22.2 percent have wood made houses. Most of the Chinese houses
are made of brick, and most of the Malay houses are made of both brick and wood. So,
Chinese farmers are comparatively richer than Malay farmers.
Availability of Vehicle
Farmers have several types of vehicles available at household level,. Among the household
vehicles, 99 percent have motorcycle, 67.2 percent have car, 49.5 percent have bicycle and
12.1 percent have lorry or van. Among all farmers, 56 percent of total households have one
car and 11 percent have two or more cars. A total of 38.9 percent households have one
motorcycle and 60.1 percent have two or more. A total of 27.3 percent of the households
have one bicycle and 22.2 percent have two or more. Only 9.6 percent households have one
lorry/ van and 2.5 percent have two or more. Overall, all households of the farmer have
minimum one vehicle.
Ownership of Agricultural Land
Among the farmers, 53 percent cultivate their own land only (traditional owners), 16.7
percent cultivate on rented land only (enterprises), and 30.3 percent cultivate both own and
rented land (mixture of both). Among the own land cultivating farmers, the size of farm
below 1 hectare is 11.4 percent, that between 1 to 3 hectares is 75.2 percent, and 3 or above is
13.3 percent. Among the farmers who cultivate on rented lands, the size of farm of 1 to 3
hectares is 54.5 percent and 3 or above is 45.5 percent. Among the farmers who cultivate
paddy on both rented and own land, 36.7 percent of farms’ size is below 1 hectares, 33.3
percent is 1 to 3 hectares and 30 percent is 3 hectares or above.
Size of Paddy Farm
The size of 17.2 percent of the farms is below 1 hectare, 59.1 percent is between 1-3 hectares,
12.1 percent is between 3-5 hectares and 11.6 percent is 5 hectares or above. So, commercial
farms are increasing more in terms of small farmers.
Availability of Machineries
Among the farmers, 7.1 percent have heavy tractors, 6.1 percent have light, 57.6 percent have
power sprayers, 48 percent have motorized blower water pumps, 57.6 percent have lawnmowers and 54.4 percent have poison sprayers. A total 6.6 percent of the farmers have none
of these machineries, 23.7 percent have only one type of machinery, 26.3 percent have any
two types of machineries, 24.2 percent have any three types of machineries, and 19.2 percent
have more than three types of machineries. It indicates that farmers are transforming to
machine oriented farming from labour oriented farming.
Disparity in Income
Small farmers are the major losers due to climate changes. Large-scale farmers get more
benefits through economies of scale, marginally more benefit for high yield, and high

productivity incentives from government. The subsidies for urea and compound have been
continuing since 1979. The incentive for land preparation and organic fertilizer has been
continuing since 2007. Providing compound and urea fertilizer, and pesticide incentive was
introduced in 2008 and is still continuing. However, unless the adverse effects of climatic
change are not reduced or removed and productivity is increased, government support and
subsidy cannot produce a sustainable and progressive paddy sector, in particular, and the
agriculture in general.
The degree of inequality is measured by Inequality Ratio, also known as Kuznets ratio. The
ratio measures inequality through the ratio of income of top 20% to income of bottom 40%.
Here, the ratio is 2.88, meaning that the degree of agricultural inequality at household level is
nearly three times. If the value was calculated on population level instead of household level,
the ratio would be more due to more population in the poorer households and less population
in richer households.
Insert Figure 1 about here
Another measure of inequality is Gini coefficient. The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 1
indicates perfect inequality and 0 means perfect equality. Based on the Lorenz Curve, which
is a graphical representation of the income/wealth vs. population distribution function, the
Gini coefficient in the agricultural sector of Malaysia is 0.443 (Figure 1) indicating quite high
degree of inequality in the agricultural community.
CLIMATE CHANGE LEADING CHANGES IN INCOME EQUALITY
Changes in Crops’ Productivity
The yields of paddy in main season and off-season are close, with very little fluctuation. The
yield (per hectare) of 13.6% of the farmers is below 5 tons, 58.5% of the farmers is 5-8 tons,
and 27.8% of the farmers is 8 tons or above. Average yield of Chinese is far better than
Malays. The average yield per hectare of Chinese is 10.09 tons where Malays is 6.47 tons,
and total is 6.85 tons. The yields of Sekinchan area, where most farmers are Chinese, are very
high in respect to yield of other locality because of high productivity and farm management
of Chinese ethnic group.
The target of IADA is 7.5 ton paddy per hectare. But the actual average yield is 6.85 ton per
hectare has been found by the survey. Moreover, 64.6 percent of farmers and 50 percent of
paddy cultivated areas are below the target level. According to the statistics, paddy yield in
the IADA, West Selangor area is 5.042 ton in 2007 that decreases to 4.819 ton in 2008
(Agriculture Statistical Handbook 2008).
Changes in Agricultural Income
According to farmers, 68.2% agree that paddy production is not profitable enough due to low
productivity. Beside this, 67.2% farmers say paddy production is still better than other crops
production because of huge subsidy and incentives. In Malaysia, government provides
several incentives to farmers to increase productivity. Among the incentives, input subsidy,
irrigation facility and land preparation incentives are proportionately distributed among the
farmers. But few subsidy and incentive programs also lead to inequality. For example,
government provides selling price subsidy RM 248.1 per ton, and yield increasing incentives

RM 650 per ton if farmer can produce 10ton or above per ha. The farmers who can produce
10 ton or above has already a higher income than other low productive farmers. As a
consequence, government incentives to theses high income farmers further accelerate the
income gap among the farming community, signaling inappropriate subsidy program of
government.
There are 38.4% of households and 44.7% population from farmer community having below
USD $5 (RM 6,387 annually) per capita income, and 65.7% of the households and 72.8% of
the population are below USD $10 (RM 12,775 annually) per capita income (Table 24).
Currently, the target of IADA is to ensure RM 2000 monthly (RM 24000 or USD $6857
annually) income only from paddy production for each farmer. Assuming only one farmer in
each household, 44% of households are currently below this level. So, substantial increase in
income is needed to reach the level.
However, projection shows that any variation of rainfall more than 0.4% by the year 2020
will cause reduction in farmers’ earnings further (NRS 2001). This projection of drop in
farmers’ income due to changes in rainfall is alarming.
Insert Table 2 about here
Changes in the Source of Agricultural Income
The IADA area is allowed only for paddy production where paddy provides 90.3% of
agriculture related income of the farmers. Moreover, one third of the farmers have income
from permanent plants such as, mango, coconut, palm oil, cocoa, banana etc., which is
alarming because these lands are not anymore suitable for cultivating paddy. IADA officials
are mostly trying to check these permanent plants, but farmers’ tendency is to shift these
plants for crops other than paddy. These permanent plants provide 7% of agricultural income
of the farmers, which is found to be maximum 63.7% for individual case.
With the paddy production, farmers also like to produce seasonal crops, seasonal fruits and
seasonal vegetables which are also prone to climate change. Only 3% of the farmers produce
these crops, and maximum of 7.6% agricultural income comes from this area. Livestock also
provides very small portion of total agricultural income of paddy producing farmers. Only
6.6% of the farmers are engaged in livestock productions that may provide maximum of
27.9% of total agricultural income.
Agricultural wages constitute another important source of agricultural income where 14.6%
of the farmers are engaged in. It provides 2.1% of average agricultural income of the farmers
that accounts for a maximum of 35.7% of individual income from agriculture.
Changes in the Sources of Household Income
The household income of farmers should arguably be more from farming activities because
their main income source is agriculture. If the non-agricultural income or other incomes are
more than agricultural income, the attention towards farming decreases and agriculture may
gradually shift from main to secondary occupation. Among the farmers, agricultural income
of 10.6% of the households is less than their non-agricultural or other incomes. Moreover,
41.4% have incomes from outside of agricultural sources, which are found maximum 97.7%
for individual case. On an average, 14.3% income of paddy farming household come from

non-agricultural income, such as non-agricultural wage or business income, and other
incomes, such as spouse income, children income, pension, welfare, land rent, other rent,
savings or investment return-dividend, interest, share market return, trust fund return,
insurance, etc.
Changes in Poverty Intensity
Among the farmers, only 2.1% live below $1 dollar poverty line, and 8.2% live below $2
dollar poverty line. According to Malaysian poverty line, 3.5% of households and 3.7% of the
populations from farming communities live below poverty line. As this group of farmers is
under high subsidized and more productive paddy growing area, here income level of farmers
is higher than outside of IADA area. Without the subsidy, the actual poverty rate goes higher.
Moreover if the subsidy is not increasing continuously, this poverty rate will increase further.
So, the vulnerability in terms of income and poverty is increasing more due to the change of
agricultural productivity and profitability.
Changes in the Profession and Agricultural Involvement
Farmers’ active involvement in agriculture is declining due to climate change. As mentioned
earlier, currently, 18.7% of the farmers do not prefer agriculture, and 17.2% are engaged in
agriculture on part time basis (Table 3). However, only 18.7% said that full time engagement
in agriculture is more profitable than part time engagement, and 56.6% support part time
engagement for more returns (Table 3). This indicates, many farmers are trying to reduce
their involvement in agriculture from full time engagement to part time workers and thus
searching for other sources of income.
Insert Table 3 about here
Farmers are engaged in agriculture because most of them (51.5%) have no alternative job
except cultivation (Table 4). 25.3% of the farmers are engaged here due to social status that
they feel it is traditional and respected job, but within this group 24% are not strongly
passionate about agriculture, but prefer trade or other job. Among the farmers, 17.2% are
engaged in agriculture on part time basis. As they have alternative occupation, 61.7% of them
are not passionate for agriculture. 6.1% of the farmers are engaged in agriculture for other
reasons and 33.3% of them do not prefer to be engaged in agriculture. A total of 18.7% of
current farmers do not prefer agriculture, but 10.1% prefer other jobs and 8.6% prefer trading.
Insert Table 4 about here
Changes in the Stability of Economic Position
Among all the farmers, 56.6% have no current savings, who are in high vulnerable group.
About 80% of households have no savings except the savings of heads of the household who
are also in high risk group. The most vulnerable groups are those who have no household
savings leaving nil per capita savings. So, any type of spike in regular life due to the natural
disaster, disease, crime or social issues will push them towards borrowings. Moreover,
household savings of 3.5% and per capita savings of 12.1% population are below RM 500,
who are fairly risky group.

According to farmers, 73.7% mentioned about having health problems due to climate change.
Climate change has many negative impacts on human health, because a wide range of
diseases ― vector-borne, water-borne and respiratory ― have links to climatic changes.
Climatic factors are directly connected to incidences of diarrhea, skin disease, malaria, kalaazar, dengue fever and other illnesses. Other health-related factors, such as dehydration,
malnutrition, and heat stress, especially among elder farmers, are closely linked to climate
factors and food production.
REQUIREMENTS FOR SOCIOECONOMIC ADAPTATION
Among the financial and relevant socioeconomic supports from government, raw materials
subsidy and cash incentive were found necessary and needed for 79.8% of the farmers to
cope with climate change impacts (Table 5). Among those who needed raw materials subsidy
54% of farmers emphasized it as very important, and among those who need cash incentive
47% mention it was very important to cope with climate change. 78.3% emphasized on
insurance supports or minimum income ensuring supports to adapt to climate change. 78.8%
of the farmers agreed about the necessity of infrastructure related supports such as
transportation and irrigation.
Insert Table 5 about here
The highest number of the farmers (80.8%) emphasized on the importance of proper
guidelines and suggestions to adapt to climate change properly. 71.7% emphasized on
importance of land usage pattern to cope with climate change. 73.2% of the farmers
mentioned that the leasing system and agricultural wage were important factors toward
adaptation to climate change. To adapt to climate change, 71.2% of the farmers thought
merger of individual farmers into single, large farms was necessary.
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
To ensure the sustainability of agriculture and relevant human livelihood in the long run,
adaptation is essential. Adaptation to climate change is a broad issue. Several recent studies
focus on climatic adaptation, especially in the agricultural sector both in Malaysia and
abroad, such as Ferdous et al. 2015, Ahmed et al. 2015, Nazneen et al. 2015, Masud et al.
2015, 2014, Hamdan et al. 2014, 2013, Devendra 2012, Salvo et al. 2013, Gebrehiwot and
Van Der Veen 2013. It needs to be undertaken at many levels, including at the household and
community levels. Many of these initiatives are self-funded (Stern 2007). Government also
needs to take proper financial supports for socioeconomic stability, technological innovation,
and infrastructural development as well as conducting several skill development programs to
the farmers. Several relative studies discussed the issue of currently available supports from
government for adaptability of the farmers, and required new supports for future adaptability
of farmers, and also suggest a guideline to consider for adaptation policy in Malaysia (Alam
et al. 2012). Current government incentive and subsidy policy are not appropriate and also
inadequate. Here, government’s subsidy supports and incentive programs need to define
strategically that it will influence yield productivity and ensure socioeconomic sustainability
without increasing inequality. Other relevant factors, such as agricultural wage, land leasing
system and rate, maximum farm size, etc. need much attention (Alam et al. 2012). These
factors are very important for sustainability of small farmers, poverty reduction and reduce
income inequality (Alam et al. 2010b, 2011). Government’s attention to these factors will
help increase overall productivity to gain self-sufficiency, or close to self-sufficiency, and to

ensure food security. Government’s supports for technological adaptation to climate change
are very important to deal with the climatic problems in the long run.
It is apparent that development of technology is a boundless area, but it is possible in several
ways. The most efficient method of technological advancement is expected to be able to
solve the problem by controlling the climate factors. China showed an example of how to
create rainfall by gun firing in the sky and also protect rainfall. Until gaining such level of
technological advancement in all aspects, there should be some phases of development which
are expected to help the agricultural farmers in their effort to adapt to climate changes. Thus,
technology needs to be developed in different stages and ways such as to improve shielding
resources such as, protect crops from excessive rainfall, solve water login problems, or to
develop defensive approach such as, verities of crops development, rainfall and temperature
tolerant plants, or to find alternative approach such as, changing crop cycle, reduce the timing
of crop cycle.
Farmers also need to take trainings to become used to the usage of basic technology. The
production practices of farm and the knowledge of individual farmer also need to be updated
with the changes of climate factors. The agricultural farmers should understand the crop
rotation, crop portfolio, crop substitutions and technological exchange knowledge sharing for
sustainable food production (Alam et al. 2012). They should also take all precautions and be
aware about the uncertainty of low rainfall and heavy rainfall. They must be careful in
arranging proper water management, both in terms of irrigation facilities and quick water
logout facilities etc. On the basis of several requirements of farmers, however, the IADA
authorities in North West Selangor also need to engage different new groups of stakeholders
to ensure necessary facilities, especially technological, insurance, training supports for
agricultural adaptation to climate change vulnerabilities.
The financial management of farms and farmers too needs to be secured for a minimum of
two seasons so that if crop is damaged in one season, they will be prepared and have the
seeds for next season; their ability to bear the cost of another crop production will guarantee
their survival financially up to the collection of the new crops. Currently heavy rainfall and
storm is a very common phenomenon in the study area. For that reason, farmers should take
the initiative for crop sharing, forward rating, hedging and insurance. Farmers also need crop
insurance facilities, but no such option is currently available. Moreover, they need to take
income stabilization programs, such as portfolio of investment, saving scheme, minimum
income protection by government or insurance to reduce the risk of income loss due to
changing climatic conditions and variability.
Finally, as climate change is not particularly related to any community, everyone needs to be
informed about its impacts and they should also be encouraged to think about its possible
adaptation approaches. Due to social interaction, the socioeconomic variables of any
community have strong linkages, interactions and influences of other community, and for any
national or common issue all social groups are interconnected and, more or less, affected. So,
everyone in the society needs to build up a mind set about the warming climate, and what
needs to be done. At the same time, people, particularly those in the richer groups, need to
explore the best ways to build low-carbon economies in spite of their luxurious and
overconsumption patterns of lifestyle. This will help to curb the socioeconomic vulnerability
of any particular groups in the society, and enable everyone in similar types of mentality to
cope with the adverse effects of climate change. At last, the study suggests preparing a

planned and proactive adaptation strategy in Malaysia to secure sound functioning of the
economic, social and agricultural system.
CONCLUSIONS
Like in many other countries, changes in climatic factors have negative impacts on
productivity of paddy cultivation in the study area. Projections of climatic change and its
adverse effects on paddy productivity and socioeconomic status of the farmers have been
found alarming. Majority of the farmers strongly perceive that climatic changes have caused
profitability of paddy cultivation to decline. Many farmers are trying to reduce their
involvement with agriculture. As a result, 56.6% are inclined to prefer part-time to full-time
engagement in paddy cultivation. A Kuznets ratio of 2.88 and the Gini coefficient of 0.443
suggest that there is a high level of income inequality among the paddy farmers in the study
area.
Among the paddy producing farmers, 68.2% agree that paddy production is not much
profitable due to low productivity. However, 67.2% of farmers feel that because of heavy
government subsidies and incentives, paddy cultivation is still better and more profitable than
production of other crops. To sustain this profitability, there is no alternative to increase the
productivity and growth of the sector.
