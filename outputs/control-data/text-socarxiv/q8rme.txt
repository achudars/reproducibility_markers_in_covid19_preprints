"8" "Abstract"
"9" "Background"
"10" "Annual gains in life expectancy in Scotland  were  slower  in recent years  than in the previous two decades. This  analysis   investigates how deaths in different age groups and from different causes have contributed to  annual average  change in life expectancy   across   two   time periods: 2000- 0 2  to   2012-14 and   2012-14 to  2015-1 7 ."
"11" "Methods"
"12" "Life expectancy at birth was calculated from death and population  counts , disaggregated by five - year age - group  and  by  underlying cause of death. Arriaga’s method of life expectancy decomposition was applied to produce estimates of the contribution of different  age-group s and underlying causes to  changes in  life expectancy at birth   for  the  two   periods."
"13" "Findings"
"14" "Average annual  l ife expectancy   gains  between 2012-14 to 2015-17   were markedly smaller than in the earlier period.   Almost all  age-group s saw worsening  mortality  trends , which deteriorated for   most cause of death  groups  between 2012-14 and 2015-17.  In particular, the previously observed  substantial life expectancy gains due to   reductions   in  mortality from  circulatory causes ,  which  most  benefited those aged 5 5 -84 years, more than halved.  M ortality rates for those aged  30-54  years and 90+ years  worsened ,  due in large part to increases in drug-related deaths ,  and dementia  and  Alzheimer’s  disease  respectively."
"15" "Interpretation"
"16" "Future research should seek to explain the changes in mortality trends for all  age-group s and causes .   More investigation is required to establish to what extent  shortcomings  in the social security system and public services may be contributing to the adverse trends and preventing mitigati on of  the impact of other contributing factors, such as influenza outbreaks."

"21" "Introduction"
"22" "L ife expectancy improvement  rates  in Scotland  have been slower since 2012- 1 4 than  in previous decades,  the inequalities gradient across the deprivation scale has steepened,  and   age-standardised  mortality rates have   increas ed   for those living in the  most deprived   quintile , leading to widening health inequalities . [1,2]   This comes against a background of consistently lower life expectancy in Scotland compared  with  the rest of Western Europe since the 1980s, and consistently worse  socioeconomic  inequalities in mortality. [3–5]"
"23" "A  similar  slow-down  since around 2012  in  the long term trend of  life expectancy has been  observed across many  high income countries . [2,6–8]  Amongst  20  high - income countries, only the USA  had   a  slower improvement in life expectancy  than the UK  in the most recent six years compared with the previous six years . [9]   Continued improvements have been seen in some of the countries with the highest life expectancies, and amongst people living in more affluent areas, both of which undermine suggestions  that   the recent trends  are   due to a ‘natural ceiling’ being reached .   [2,10,11]"
"24" "Other e xplanations for the r ecent trends have included : that the UK, along with much of the rest of Western Europe,  has  experienced  exceptionally high winter mortality;   [12–14]  that  an increase in  ‘deaths of despair’ –  those  from alcohol, drug s , and suicides – have offset broader health improvements; [15,16]   that funding for health and social care services has not kept up with demand;  [17,18]   and, relatedly, that austerity policies have impacted on health through mechanisms such as reduced social security payments and underemployment.   [19–22]   Such explanations are likely neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive, and some (such as additional winter deaths  and slowing  improvements in  ischaemic heart disease  mortality ) may plausibly  result from  other causes (such as  increased pressure on  healthcare  services and associated unmet need ). [23]"
"25" "Many of the above explanations  differ  about how mortality  changes for specific   age-group s, and  causes, have contributed to the overall slow - down in life expectancy  growth .  This  includes  increases in several countries in mortality  from  dementia/Alzheimer’s  d isease, drug-related deaths, suicide and marked slow - downs in the previous rapid improvements in  death rates from  cardiovascular causes. [14–16]"
"26" "This paper  describes the contribution of   specific   age - group s  and   causes  of death  to the  slow - down in life expectancy growth  in Scotland  by comparing  two   time periods (2000- 0 2  to   2012-14 and  2012-14 to  2015-1 7 )."
"27" "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT"
"28" "Evidence before this study"
"29" "We identified e vidence  on  mortality trends  across high income countries  published between 2000 and 2019  through Medline and Embase, supplemented by grey literature from  National Records of Scotland, the Office for National Statistics , Public Health England  and the Scottish Public Health Observatory.  The evidence identified was generally  high quality.  We found that l ife expectancy improvements have stalled across many high income countries since around 2012. In England, drug-related deaths, Alzheimer’s Disease and dementia have been important in explain ing  these trends,  whilst  suicide has also been important in the USA."
"30" "Added value of this study"
"31" "The findings of this study add value to the existing evidence by breaking down the causes of a relatively new but well observed trend.   While previous studies have focused on the role of influenza and old age mortality, this study shows that  almost all causes of death, and all ages, have seen a  negative change in the trend, with  slowing improvements in heart disease and worsening drug related mortality  being most important ."
"32" "Implications of all the available evidence"
"33" "Further research should focus understanding the processes underlying changes at different ages. Specifically, increasing drug related mortality in working age adults, slowing improvements in heart and circulatory disease in middle aged to elderly people and the rise in mortality linked to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in the very old.  Priority should be given to investigating whether there is a common underlying cause or exposure affecting  all causes and age groups."
"34" "Methods"
"35" "Period l ife expectancy at birth was calculated from abridged life tables for m ales  and  females  separately, using three-years combined data to allow robust breakdowns by cause of death and age - group. [24]  For the age-group decomposition, death counts and population data  in  five year age - groups were used ,  separating   <1  year   from  1-4 year olds and using 90+ as the  oldest  age category . For the cause   of   death decomposition ,  International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 th  Revision (ICD-10) categories were grouped into eight large categories: Circulatory, Cancers, Dementia & Alzheimer’s, Respiratory, Drug-related, External, Residual, and Other  (see web table 1) .  These groupings are exclusive and exhaustive, and were developed on the basis that :  at least the five leading causes of death should be  separate   categories ;  proposed and plausible contributory causes to life expectancy changes should ideally be independent categories ;  and  that  the residual group should overall make a small contribution to life expectancy changes. The leading causes of death categorisation used by the  Office for National Statistics ( ONS )  was employed as the basis to determine groupings, where appropriate. [25]   D ue to the overlaps between drug-related deaths and other causes (mental and behavioural excl uding  dementia, suicides, accidents and other external), for the purposes of this analysis these four causes exclude drug-related deaths  (see  A ppendix 2 ) ."
"36" "We calculated the changes in life expectancy between three-year rolling periods for males and females for the whole time series from 1980 before focusing on two time periods from 2000 onwards for cause decomposition work.  The tenth revision of ICD was implemented in 2000  in Scotland  and data prior to this period  is   not be consistent across the cause of death categories examined.   L ife expectancy  growth  between 2000-02 and 2012-14 and between 2012-14 and 2015-17 was decomposed into age and cause components using Arriaga’s method with the aid of syntax developed by Auger et al.   [26,27]   T he break between the two periods  was selected on the basis of  the previously identified change in mortality trend ( around 2012-14 ). [2]   Life expectancy change and decomposition results are presented as average annual change in life expectancy (in weeks) to account for the different length of the two time periods."
"37" "Results"
"38" "Rate of improvement in life expectancy"
"39" "Life expectancy  increased  steadily in recent decades ,  but  improvements  h ave  stalled and  life expectancy has  decreased in  recent  years. In 1980-82 life expectancy at birth for males was 69.1 years and for  females 75.3 years.  Thi s   increased  to 77.0 years for males and 81.1 years for females in 2015-17 ( Web   f igure 1).   Although t he rate of  growth  has  fluctuated  over time ,   it has rarely been as low as in the last few years .  ( Web f igure 2)"
"40" "Decomposition by  a ge  and  s ex"
"41" "Between  2000- 0 2  and 2012-14,  the average annual increase in  male life expectancy  was  16.3 weeks/year . However, between 2012-14 and 2015-17 ,  male life expectancy  fell  by  an average of   1.1 weeks/year .   During the earlier period,  improvements  in mortality rates were seen for all age - groups such that they all contributed to increases in life expectancy  (Figure 1) . However, by far the greatest contributions  (61% of all growth)  were made by improvements in mortality rates between the ages of  55  and  79  years. During the later period,  deaths among  males   aged 40-54 years and aged 90+ years  made substantial negative contributions to the overall changes in life expectancy.  Although still contributing positively to life expectancy growth in the later period, the rate of mortality improvement among 55-84 year old males declined markedly and contributed considerably to the slowing down of life expectancy growth . There was a notable reduction in the rate of improvement for  males  aged 15-34 years, although the smaller number of deaths at these ages meant  that this made  a smaller contribution to the overall change in life expectancy. There w ere  also small but noticeable declines in the rate of improvement for infants and children  aged 1-4  years ."
"42" "The age contributions to changes in life expectancy  were  similar for females, although both the rates of improvement and the scale of change from the previous rates  we re smaller  than for males  (Figu re 1 ). Between 2000-02 and 2012-14 female life expectancy grew at a rate of  10.0  weeks / year, with improvements in mortality rates for all  age-group s. The biggest contributions to the overall  growth   (64%)  were due to  improvements   in mortality for those aged  60 -84 years.  However, between 2012-14 and 2015-17 the  average annual  improvement in life expectancy declined to  less than  0.1 weeks/year. For those aged 30-49 years and aged 85+ years, mortality rates had  worsened  over the  later  time period. However, substantial  mortality improvements  amongst those aged  60 -84 years w ere  very much reduced. There  were  also declines in the rate of improvement for infants, children aged 1-4 years   and  10-14 year olds ."

"44" "Decomposition by  c ause of  d eath"
"45" "For males,  the biggest single cause of  the slow-down   in  life expectancy  growth  was  a  slower rate of improvement  in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality  (Figure 2) . Until 2012-14 ,   reductions   in IHD mortality added 5.8 weeks / year to male life expectancy ;   i n the later period  they  added  only  2.2 weeks per year :  a net reduction in  life expectancy   growth of 3.6 weeks /year ."
"46" "Drug-related deaths  had the  second   biggest impact  for males ,  changing   from a small negative impact (-0.4 weeks /year ) prior to 2012-14 to a much larger negative impact of  - 2.4 weeks /year  after wards .  Other circulatory diseases and cerebrovascular disease   also  had a c onsiderable impact,  together  contributing  a fall of   3.0 weeks /year  to the reduction  in life expectancy growth ;  dementia and Alzheimer’s  disease  caused a fall of 1.0 weeks /year ."
"47" "Notably , reductions  in mortality for several causes of death continued to make positive contributions to overall life expectancy growth  in the later period , but at a  slower  rate than in the earlier period.  Only two causes, genitourinary and other respiratory causes ,  contributed more to  male  life expectancy growth after 2012-14 than before."
"48" "For females, the same broad causes had the largest impact on life expectancy growth  although again the scale of change  was   smaller   than for m ales .  Although still improving in absolute terms, the  slow - down in improvements in  IHD  mortality  was the largest single contributor to the change in trend  (net contribution - 2. 5  weeks /year ) ."
"49" "As in males, drug-related deaths had the  second  biggest impact on life expectancy, changing from a small negative impact  before  2012-14 to a much larger negative impact  (net contribution - 1.5 weeks/year ) ."
"50" "The  contribution of  previous improvements  in mortality from  other circulatory  causes  of 0.8 weeks/year reversed  with  a decline of 0.7 weeks/year  in the  later time period .   The trend for cerebrovascular disease was similar to IHD, where there was a marked decline in the rate of improvement (of 1.1 weeks/year)  between the two time periods ."
"51" "M ortality due to   d ementia and Alzheimer’s  disease  worsened   from the earlier period ,  mak ing  a negative contribution of  0.9 weeks /year  to changes in  life expectancy  growth ."
"52" "For  some causes of death   female  mortality improved after 2012-14 , making     a positive contribution to life expectancy growth ;   these  includ ed  lung cancer,  other respiratory causes,  other cancers,  genitourinary,  ill-defined causes and  breast ca ncer."

"54" "*Excluding causes that are includ ed  under drug-related deaths."
"55" "Contributions of broad categories of death by broad age bands"
"56" "For the analysis of cause of death within age - group, the age and cause of death categories  were   aggregated into five mutually exclusive age - groups, and eight mutually exclusive cause-of-death groupings  (40 age-cause groupings) .   A more detailed disaggregation  (20 age - groups and 2 6  cause-of-death groups)  is presented  in  Web   figures 3 and 4."
"57" "The  contributions of different broad categories of death to the trends in life expectancy var ied   throughout the life-course ,  but  were  generally similar between  m ales   and  females . For those aged <35 years, reductions in mortality from external causes of death made the greatest single contribution ( 1.4 and 0.4 weeks/year for  m ales   and  females  respectively) to the positive trend between 2000-02 and 2012-14.  B etween 2012-14 and 2015-17, this positive contribution reduced to 0.3 weeks/year for  males  and d isappeared  for  females . Furthermore,  mortality rates for drug-related deaths and cancers  increase d  slightly  in the later time period  for  those aged <35 years , reducing the ir  positive contribution to life expectancy  growth  (Figure 3) ."
"58" "For those aged 35-54 years, the overall negative contribution to life expectancy described in Figure 1 was due both to substantial reductions in the rate of improvement for some broad c auses  of death and absolute increases  in mortality  for others. Circulatory causes made a positive contribution of 0.8 and 0.3 weeks/year for  males  and  females  respectively for the earlier period, but this reduced to just 0.1 weeks/year for  males , and a  negative contribution  of 0.3 weeks/year for  females  in the later period. The largest contributor to the negative trend for this  age-group  was drug-related deaths amongst both  males  and  females  which  fell  from -0.7 and -0.3 weeks/year respect ively in the earlier period ,  to -2 .1 and -1.5 weeks/year in the later period. Cancers and other causes  also contributed slightly  to the overall worsening trends in this  age-group  (Figure s  3  and 4 )."
"59" "Although the overall contribution to life expectancy of the group aged 55-74 years remained positive, the dramatic decline in the positive contribution of this  age-group  is important in explaining overall trends  (Figure 1 ). For both  males  and  females  much of this decline is explained by the much slower  improvement  in deaths for circulatory causes in the later period compared  with  the earlier period. Th e contribution to life expectancy growth  declined from 4.7 to 0.7 weeks/year for  males  and from 3.2 to 0.6 weeks/year for  females . The positive contribution of continuing mortality  improvements  for cancer was less for  males  in the later period compared to the earlier period (reducing from 2.1 to 1.6 weeks/year), but increased marked ly  for  females  from 1.0 to 2. 3  weeks/year. For both  males  and  females , dementia deaths, as well as the causes categorised as ‘other’ and ‘residual’, all made negative contributions in the later time period to life expectancy  growth  (Figure s  3  and 4 )."
"60" "The contributions of broad causes of death amongst those aged 75-89 years  was  similar to that of those aged 55-74 years, but the negative contribution of dementia  and Alzheimer’s  disease   was  much more marked. For  males , the negative contribution increased from  - 0.3 to  - 1.0 weeks/year; whilst the negative contribution for  females  increased from  - 0.8 to  - 1.2 weeks/year. The positive contribution due to circulatory causes in this  age-group  reduce d  from 2.9 to 1.2 weeks/year for  males  and from 3.5 to 1.9 weeks/year for  females . The positive contribution from reduced cancer mortality in this  age-group   increased  for both  males  and  females  (but more so for females)  between the earlier and later time periods (Figure s  3  and 4 )."
"61" "Amongst the oldest  age-group  (90+ years), the small overall contribution to life expectancy  growth  changed from positive to negative between the earlier and later time periods (Figure 1). This was due to  worsening  mortality due to dementia ( negative contribution  increasing from  - 0.1 to  - 0.3  weeks/year , and from  - 0.4 to  - 0.8 weeks/year for m ales  and  females  respectively) and well as a  slowing in the rate of improvement due to circulatory causes , primarily among females  (Figure s  3  and 4 )."
"62" "When the more detailed age - groups and causes of death are examined (Web figures 3 and 4), there are a number of interesting findings.  M ortality  in the first year of life  from causes  of death  originating in the perinatal period   has improved at a slower rate since 2012-14 for males and has worsened slightly for females  (although given the relatively small numbers and the fact that this has not occurred for both sexes, this finding should be treated with caution) .    The detailed findings  also indicate that the  increasing  negative contribution of drug-related deaths is  mainly concentrated in 35-44  year  olds  for  females and 40-49 year  olds  for males.    T he rising contribution of IHD   is  mainly    concentrated in  60-69 year  old    males ,  and 65-74  year  old   females , the negative contribution of suicides is concentrated in 25-29 year old males, and the rising contribution of   d ementia  and Alzheimer’s Disease is concentrated in the oldest age - groups."

"67" "Discussion"
"68" "Main results"
"69" "Life expectancy in Scotland  steadily   improved from the early 1980s until 2012 -14 , after which the rate of improvement  slowed ,   followed by declines in life expectancy  between 2014-16 and 2015- 1 7. Between 2000-02 and 2012-14,  average  annual  increases in  male and female life expectancy were 16 .3  and 10 .0  weeks/year  respectively , but this changed to a decline of 1.1 weeks/year for  males   and to a very small increase of  less than  0.1 weeks/year for  females   between 2012-14 and 2015-17. In the earlier period most of the increases in life expectancy were due to  reduced  mortality  amongst those aged  55 -84 years, although mortality rates  declined   for all  age-group s. In the later period  reductions   were smaller   for all  age-group s, but most substantially for those aged  5 5 -84 years . M ortality  increased  for  males   aged 3 0 -54 years ,  females   aged 35-49 years and  both males and females  aged 90+ years."
"70" "A wide range of causes of death were responsible for the  observed  chang es in life expectancy  growth . Although mortality  due to  IHD and cerebrovascular disease  continued to  decline   in the later period , the life expectancy gains due to th ese conditions  were less than half of those in the earlier period. This affected all  age-group s, but was particularly important in explaining the decline in improvement for those aged 55-74  years ,  and to a lesser extent  those aged 35-54 years. Mor tality from drug-related deaths and  from  dementia and Alzheimer’s  disease,   which  were   already  making a negative contribution to life expectancy   in the earlier period,  made larger negative contribution s   after 2012-14, and the previous  positive effects from  mortality from other circulatory causes reversed. The increase in drug-related deaths was particularly important in explaining increasing mortality amongst those aged 35-54 years, whilst increases in dementia and Alzheimer’s  disease   mortality  w ere  important in  explaining trends among  those aged 90+ years."
"71" "How this compares  with   existing research"
"72" "M uch of the initial research describing recent  changes  in life expectancy  trends  has focused  on the role of influenza and higher mortality amongst the oldest  age-group s. [14,28]  Although we also s aw  increases in deaths due to influenza and respiratory causes, and rising mortality amongst those aged 90 +  years, the contribution they make to the overall change in life expectancy  growth  in Scotland is small. Subsequent research for England & Wales, and for the USA, show very similar findings to those  we report : that the slow - down in improvements for IHD  and  cerebrovascular disease ,  and increases in mortality for other circulatory causes  among 55-84 year olds  and drug-rel ated deaths for adults aged 35-49  years ,  make substantial contributions to the overall trends.  [29–35]"
"73" "There is evidence that  the increase in drug-related deaths in Scotland is due in part to a cohort effect amongst  males  who were young adults during the 1980s ,  [36]  and that some of the recent trends may therefore be attributable to historical exposures to political and social change at that time and before.  [37]"
"74" "The explanation for the slowing of the  improvement  in cardiovascular disease mortality is not clear. Possible explanations might include slowing of progress in reducing exposure to tobacco, increases in the prevalence of obesity, changes in psychosocial risk factors related to economic insecurity or deterioration in access to or the quality of health and social care services."
"75" "The  increase in mortality from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease has been attributed to a number of factors, including : people living longer and surviving other illnesses; [38]  increased awareness of dementia, making it more likely to be diagnosed and recorded ; [14,35]   and   NHS policies encouraging  dementia diagnosis .   [35]   C hanges in death certification practices  have also been cited as one of the reasons for increase in deaths from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, [9]  although it should be  noted that these changes did  not  occur in Scotland until 2017 so will have had  a more  limited impact on these results ."
"76" "Strengths  and l imitations"
"77" "This paper for the first time describes the contribution of specific  age-group s and causes of death, individually and in combination, to the recent change s   in  trend s  in life expectancy in Scotland. It  u ses   a high quality dataset of deaths in which very few death registrations are missing ,  [39]   and  w here   less than 10% of deaths are coded using ill-defined causes.  [40]  The se results  are however limited  to describing the trends in death rates and do   n o t explain the  causal social and biological processes.  This analysis does not differentiate the mechanism by which a given cause of death  exerts  an effect on life expectancy; a negative impact may be attributable to increased incidence of the condition, increased case fatality, or a reduction in age at death.  By necessity , for the analysis by cause of death  within age - group ,  we had to use broad groupings of causes of death  which is also likely to conflate diverse causal  mechanisms ."
"78" "Implications"
"79" "Further   research is   required to test the hypotheses that have been proposed to explain   recent life expectancy trends in Scotland and  other  high income countries.   [23]  This  should  include work to understand the  mechanisms and processes underlying the  changes at different stages in the life course: the considerable rise in drug-related de aths among working - age adults;  the  substantial slow - down in improvements for IHD, cerebrovascular disease and other circulatory causes (particularly amongst adults aged 5 5 -84 years); and the rise in mortality attributed to dementia and Alzheimer’s  disease  amongst those aged 90+ years."
"80" "T he recent change in life expectancy trends  represent s  a very substantial mortality impact which needs to be reflected in the level of priority  given to understanding this further .  Mortality has worsened (either through reduced  scale  of improvement or absolute increases in mortality) across many age groups  and can be attributed to a  range of causes of death, so it is unlikely that  a ny  single factor  provides   a  sufficient  explanation .  The extent to which there is a common underlying cause or exposure affecting each of these age groups should be prioritised for further investigation."
"81" "Conclusion"
"82" "The trend in life expectancy in Scotland changed markedly from positive  growth  to  stalling and decline  after 2012 -14 . Mortality rates  have worsened  among those  aged 35-49 years and 90+ years, particularly due to increasing drug-related deaths and  dementia and  Alzheimer’s  disease  respectively; and  life expectancy gains   due to improvements in mortality from circulatory causes ,  which most benefited those aged 55-84 years ,   more than hal ved.  Future research should seek to explain the  causal mechanism behind the  changes in mortality trends for all  age-group s and causes of death ."

"249" "As the drug-related codes overlap with mental and behavioural causes (exc. dementia) and external causes (suicides, accidents and other external), where a death would appear in both categories, we included it in the drug-related category only, and therefore the other 4 categories exclude drug-related deaths.  This was done for two reasons: firstly, the interest in the impact of recent drug-related death trends; and secondly, because of ICD coding changes in 2011   there is a discontinuity in the figures for external causes and mental and behavioural causes. This change caused deaths which would previously have been coded as mental and behavioural causes to be coded as external causes.  As this change occurred at a key point in the time period we are analysing, it would give misleading results on the relative impact of these causes on life expectancy growth. The coding change did not affect the figures for drug-related deaths, so by selecting these as a separate category, the discontinuity is avoided."
