Income Inequality and Organisational Trust in Europe – Perception and Reality
Abstract
The undesirable outcomes linked to high levels of income inequality are numerous. The existing literature
argues that negative effects of inequality are channelled by low levels of trust. This study gives evidence
that trust in government organisations diminishes in an environment of high inequality. With the
introduction of a subjective measure of how individuals perceive income inequality, past limitations in
quantifying the underlying mechanism between inequality and trust are addressed. A significant negative
association between perceived inequality and trust in political institutions, like the government and the EU,
is found using a sample of 27 European countries. Additionally, the negative interaction effect of perceived
and actual income inequality with institutional trust appears to be stronger for individuals with previously
low levels of trust and is weakened for citizens with a predicted high level of confidence in government
institutions.

1 Introduction
The undesirable outcomes linked to high levels of income inequality are numerous. Among several,
these are poor educational performance (Kawachi et al. 1997), violence (Patterson 1991), low levels
of wellbeing (Alesina et al. 2011) and health (Wilkinson 2006), as well as slow economic growth
(Barro 2000) or low provision rates of social goods (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). It is argued that
those negative effects of inequality are channelled by low levels in trust (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009).
In addition, it has been shown that social trust is indeed negatively affected by income inequality
(Leigh 2006; Putnam 2007; Uslaner and Brown 2005; Gustavsson and Jordahl 2008). The essential
argument why inequality reduces social trust is that in societies with high inequality, differences
between individuals are too large for them to feel connected and to trust each other. Which is, in
return, reflected by a society’s capability for collaborative action, such as innovation ( Stephany et al. 2019).
However, most of the existing literature refers to social or generalised trust when trying to explain
how income inequality harms society (Stephany 2019b & Stephany 2017). One could assume that
trust in organisations, for example, in the government or in the EU, diminishes as well in an
environment of high inequality, since appropriate political representation is questioned (Stephany
2019a). It is the distribution of resource which helps to explain levels of organisational trust. In a
society where high income is related to high political influence, an increase in income inequality is
associated to a skewed representation of the people in political bodies. The increase of inequality in
political representation could result in frustration of the less influential part of the society which
would then lead to a lack of trust in political institutions. Lynch (2000, p.1202) points out that the
effect of income inequality on trust can be traced back to the disparity of resources which leads to a
“…systematic underinvestment across a wide range of human, physical, health, and social
infrastructure…”. Unwanted consequences have been also documented, for example, in health care
supply (Firth-Cozens 2004), in the work of NGOs (Kramer 1999), and in banking (Seal 1998).
So far, studies on the linkage between income inequality and trust mainly suffer from three
limitations. Firstly, most of the research, which concludes with a negative relation between income
inequality and generalized trust, has examined the effect on a national level (Leigh 2006; Rothstein
and Uslaner 2005; Jordahl 2007; Gustavsson and Jordahl 2008). The potential loss of information due
to aggregation has been raised. Subsequently, other scholars have shown that individual factors like
optimism in life (Uslaner 2002), personal economic success (Dohmen, Verbakel and Kraaykamp 2010)
or ethnic fragmentation (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002) have a notable influence on generalised trust.
But even when researchers tried to contribute to this shortcoming by applying individual control
characteristics on one side, the measure of income inequality, on the other side, remained
aggregated (Braesemann and Stephany 2017, Stephany and Braesemann 2017).
The second problem of most of the previous studies is that even though the empirical results indicate
a negative association between generalized trust and inequality, the mechanism behind the
phenomenon is often not entirely clear. One line of reasoning is that the more stratified societies are,
the more closed they become and people are less likely to interact with others from different
economic strata. This so called stratification effect can be traced back to the actual allocation of
resources (Elgar and Aitken 2010; Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). Another argument is that individuals
in unequal economies – particularly at the lower end of the income distribution – do not perceive the
others to share the same living realities or fate (Uslaner and Brown 2005). Because of this perception
effect, they refuse to trust others with whom they share so little. The envy of the less fortunate
(Wilkinson and Pickett 2009), a lack of optimism (Rohstein and Uslaner 2005; Delhey and Newton
1

2005) or egalitarian values (Gustavsson and Jordahl 2008) have proven to be mechanisms through
which income perception interacts with trust. Following along this line of argumentation, it would be
the perception of economic disparities and not the actual economic measure influencing levels of
trust. Standard objective measures of income inequality, like the Gini coefficient, would then at least
partly fail to capture both the stratification effect and the perception effect in only one variable.
An additional doubt about the completeness of the existing results of the relation of income
inequality and social trust is cast by the selection of countries in the empirical analysis. The negative
inequality-trust relationship in some studies seems to be driven by a group of non-western countries
with relatively high levels of inequality (Rohstein and Uslaner 2005). For one, high inequality
countries, such as Latin America, are culturally substantively different from low inequality regions
(Oyserman and Lee 2008). They have a relatively low level of per capita income, which leads to a high
correlation of wealth and income inequality. Furthermore, it might be possible that income inequality
(or its perception) unfold an effect on organisational trust just after passing a certain threshold,
instead of showing a linear influence. It might be that income inequality becomes a more powerful
predictor of organisational trust in unequal countries than in more equal societies, since poverty and
inequality have been proven to jointly hinder trust more severely (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009).

In this study, the first two shortcomings of the past are tackled by the use of an additional subjective
and individual measurement of inequality. In this way, the study is able to distinguish the perception
effect and the stratification effect and measure their influences on trust separately. In order to avoid
a potential bias of high inequality countries, the study focuses on the EU27 and finally sheds some
light on the relationship between income inequality and organisational trust in European ‘low
inequality’ countries. The examined sample of countries is more homogenous; though it shows a
substantial variation in both, income inequality, and organisational trust. Lastly, statements about
the interplay of economic reality and individual perception are possible with the results of the
examination of interaction terms. Our results indicate that income inequality is negatively associated
with organisational trust, at least for political bodies. The same holds true for perceived income
inequality. Regarding the interaction of income inequality and perception, it can be seen that a
combination of both a high inequality surrounding and a strong belief in the urge of economic
imbalances lead to poor levels of trust.
In the following, second section, the paper presents the data and methodology applied to it. The
third section shows the results of the model. The last section concludes.
2 Data and Methodology
Sample
For testing the hypothesis of a negative relationship between income inequality and organisational
trust two datasets are used. The data about national Gini levels of net household income come from
the EU-SILC 2009 dataset, in which all EU27 countries are included. Here, the Gini coefficient is
measured on a scale from 0 (perfectly equal distribution of income) to 100 (perfectly unequal
distribution). The 2009 edition of Eurobarometer (EB) on Poverty and Social Exclusion delivers the
individual characteristics, categories of organisational trust, and a subjective measurement of
perceived income inequality. After keeping only individuals with all necessary information, 26.635
observations in 27 countries remain.
2

The original question about perceived inequality in the EB reads: “Nowadays in (OUR COUNTRY)
income differences between people are far too large?“. Answers to this question are coded in a fourstep fashion, with the outcomes “Totally disagree” (1), “Tend to disagree” (2), “Tend to agree” (3),
and “Totally agree” (4).
The EB asks two different questions regarding the trust of Europeans in local and national authorities.
The first one concerns the general trust in the national government and the national parliament. It
reads: “Please tell me how much you personally trust each of the following institutions using a scale
from 1 to 10 where [1] means ‘you do not trust the institution at all' and [10] means ‘you trust it
completely'!“. Answers therefore result in a 10 scale outcome. The second question elaborates on
the people’s trust in the fight against poverty of the following institutions; The European Union, the
(national) government, regional or local authorities, NGOs and charities, religious institutions, private
companies, and the citizens themselves. The question is phrased: “For each of the following, please
tell me if you tend to trust it or not with regard to their action in combating poverty.” The EB codes
the answers to this question as “Tend not to trust it” (0) and “Tend to trust it” (1). Table 1 displays the
levels of (perceived) inequality and trust. It can be seen that there is a relatively big variation in the
trust variables and the two inequality measures across EU27 countries. Figure 1 explains the
correlation between the two inequality measures and trust in government and shows that while
actual inequality and perceived inequality are not entirely in line, the simple correlation coefficient
between the Gini and country-aggregated perception is 0.33. Country aggregates of institutional trust
and (perceived) inequality, on the other hand, have some basic association at first sight.

Methodology
The work by Steijn and Lancee (2011) has made some contribution on the possible interplay between
actual, perceived inequality and generalized trust. Controlling for perceived inequality and national
wealth, they do not find any robust negative association between inequality and generalized trust.
Their methodological framework shall serve as a starting point with further improvements to be
made: In addition to national wealth (2009 GDP per Capita) it might be interesting to see if individual
wealth – particularly for the case of perceived inequality – plays an equally important role. The
household’s financial outlook contributes at this stage. In the following analysis, results are
additionally given as marginal effects 1. Lastly, though their dependent variable, generalised trust, has
an ordinal output from one to ten, the authors decided to employ a simple logit model rather than an
ordinal one. They justify this by arguing that the skewed distribution of generalised trust would
violate the proportional odds assumption.
The effect of perceived and actual inequality is examined in two mixed-effect logit models with
country clusters, the first, with the dependent variable of general organisational trust, the second,
with the dependent variable of organisational trust in poverty combating. At a later stage the
marginal effects of Gini, income perception, and their interaction are presented separately. Particular
attention is paid to the interpretation of the interaction term. The significance and the sign of the
effect might be different for different observations. Though this issue of statistical complexity has
been raised convincingly by some scholars in the past, many even well-published pieces of research

Steijn and Lancee (2011) report their results in logit coefficients, rather than calculating the marginal
effects of the associations of (perceived) inequality with trust.

have mistakenly misinterpreted the interaction effect in non-linear probit or logit models (Norton
and Wang, 2004, pp.154)2.
Beside actual inequality, perceived inequality, their interaction term and 2009 GDP per Capita 3, the
following individual characteristics are used to explain trust in institutions: Age, years of education,
dummies for different employment statuses, as well as for marital statuses. Some more individual
controls are supposed to improve the accuracy of the estimation. Satisfaction with life has been
shown to be interrelated with both inequality and trust. The question to which extent poverty is a
problem in the individual’s society might be important for the examination of organisational trust in
poverty fighting. In addition a self-stated valuation of the household’s financial outlook is given,
which is meant to control for personal wealth. Controls for rural and urban areas are added as well 4.
3 Results
Before examining the association between (perceived) income inequality and organisational trust,
the analysis of some individual characteristics in the inequality-trust relationship is helpful to better
understand the overall context. At the bottom of table 2, the characteristics of life satisfaction and
generalized trust, exhibit a clear pattern across all measures of institutional trust. The more people
trust each other in general, the more they trust their institutions, and at the same time, the more
satisfied they are with their life, the higher their level of organisational trust. A similarly
homogeneous association can be found between the household’s financial outlook and
organisational trust. The worse individuals believe their household finance will be in the future, the
less they tend to trust institutions and their work against poverty on average. In addition, it can be
found that trust in the poverty alleviation of local governments, religious institutions, private
companies and citizens, increases with population density in the community and that trust in
governments, parliaments, as well as in the work of the EU and (local) governments diminishes, the
more individuals believe that poverty is a widespread problem. Interestingly, while the younger
individuals are, the less they tend to trust their own government, parliament and religious
institutions, the more they rely on the poverty fighting of the EU and NGOs.
Table 3 summarizes the marginal effects of inequality, perceived inequality and their interaction,
including all other covariates mentioned in table 3, in three separate models. First, the two inequality
measures are taken into consideration; second, all the marginal effect of the interaction term is
shown in addition. For general trust, the government and the parliament are taken into
consideration. For trust in poverty alleviation the EU, the government, local governments, NGOs,
religious institutions, private companies and the citizens themselves are the institutions in question.
For the case of the government (parliament), macroeconomic income inequality appears to have a
negative and significant association with general trust and trust in poverty fighting. This observation
supports the previous findings on organisational trust and inequality. For perceived inequality the

A well-explained outline of the correct interpretation of interaction effects in non-linear models can be
found in the work of Ai and Norton (2003). Mainly interpretation mistakes can be avoided by displaying the
interaction effect graphically over the interval of predicted probability of the dependent variable. The
performance of a Z-test for the interaction effect across the predicted probability can help to resolve questions
about the effect’s significance. Both types of graphical assistance are applied in the further analysis.

negative linkage seems to be even more dominant, with the exception of trust in EU’s and citizens’
poverty alleviation. In this sense, inequality perception has a more widespread negative association
with confidence in institutions. The perception effect, exceeds the stratification effect in terms of its
range.
The interaction effect is quite more difficult to interpret. By examining the average marginal effect of
Model 2 in table 3, no significantly negative association between trust and high levels of perceived
inequality in the context of real income imbalances can be observed. Nevertheless, at this point it
should be made clear that in non-linear models the interpretation of the interaction term is not as
intuitive as in linear models. The bare number shows no significant marginal interaction effect of Gini
and inequality perception on general trust in the government. The calculation has been performed in
the way that the effect of a marginal increase in perceived inequality, given a certain level of Gini,
across the predicted probability of trusting the government is shown in Figure 2a). The marginal
effect of the interaction term varies significantly both in magnitude and direction across predicted
probabilities. Other covariates predicting institutional trust play an influential role, apparently. For
individuals with a predicted low level of trust in their government, on the left end of the distribution,
a marginal increase in inequality perception in the context of real income inequality has a negative
effect. While on the right end of the scale, where predicted trust is high, marginal increases in
subjective income inequality, under given inequality levels, show a positive effect on trust in the
government. A corresponding Z-test confirms that these results at the low and high end of the
predicted trust scale are significant. In the same framework, similar patterns are displayed for trust in
the parliament and in the government’s poverty alleviation (Figure 2b and 2d). The effects of the
interaction term on the remaining items of institutional trust, on average, suffer from a lack of
statistical significance (see Z-tests in Figure 2a-i). An exception might be the case of trust in the EU’s
and local governments’ poverty combat. Here, again, significantly positive effects at the right end of
the scale can be noticed.
4 Conclusions
The analysis has confirmed some prior assumptions about the linkage of trust and income inequality
and, at the same time, revealed new findings on the association between income inequality and the
perception of it with regard to institutional trust.
First, some descriptive findings about inequality and trust are worth noticing. In the EU 27 income
imbalances are perceived as relatively high. With an average numeric response of 3.5 (on a 1-4 scale),
all citizens on average at least believe that income imbalances have become (far) too high in the last
years. On the other hand, trust in national governments is surprisingly low. With a numeric average
of 4.0 (1-10), most citizens in Europe declare, that they rather do not tend to trust their government.
Second, income inequality and perceived inequality do not measure the same thing. The two
measures only show a relatively weak simple correlation. Therefore, they have to be examined
separately and the effort should be made to evaluate their joint potential towards institutional trust.
Third, income inequality and perceived income inequality have a significantly negative association –
in marginal terms - with institutional trust and with the confidence in the poverty combat of major
institutions in society. Generally, it can be stated that whenever economic or perceived income
inequality is high, trust in government institutions is low. Fourth, the analysis of joint effects of
income inequality and perceived inequality on institutional trust should be interpreted with some
deliberation. The interaction effect in non-linear models can be different across the outcome levels
5

of the dependent variable. For general trust in the government and the parliament, as well as for
trust in poverty alleviation of the government, a S-shaped pattern across the predicted probability
can be noticed. Two different interpretations can be made. For individuals with predicted low levels
of trust, higher subjective inequality seems to have an ever stronger negative impact in the context
of real income inequality. For citizens with a high level of predicted trust, on the other side, the
negative marginal interaction effect is weakened. One possible conclusion to be drawn from this
picture is that citizens with a strong confidence in their institutions – predicted by their personal
characteristics – are less exposed to the risk of losing their fate in the face of high objective and
subjective inequality. Those who have not a lot of confidence to start with, on the other hand, are
even more discouraged if they (correctly) believe that their society has become too unequal.
Further Research
Having shown that inequality and its perception are negatively associated with organisational trust, it
might be interesting to see if this linkage subsists for different subgroups of society. From a
theoretical point of view, it might be advisable to apply measures of inequality retrieved from units
smaller than the overall population. Since the comparison with the economic status of other
individuals appears to influence our level of trust, a more accurate definition of this reference group
seems to be necessary. The income inequality within a person’s age-range might be more
determinative for the individual’s level of trust than the economic imbalances of the overall society.
With this approach, at the same time, a common criticism of studies contemplating the inequality
trust linkage could be overruled. It has been sceptically claimed that country specific cultural
differences, un-related to inequality, are supposed to be the true drivers of trust. With the
application of age-specific inequality measures, however, meaningful within-country comparisons
would be accomplishable.
