Abstract:
The American Community Survey (ACS) summary file data provide rolling 5-year
estimates of demographic and socioeconomic indicator data for small geographies
throughout the United States. These estimates are commonly used as indicators for
regression models to measure conditions in communities. The Margins of Error (MOE) in
the ACS estimates for small geographic areas can often be very large, and without taking
them into account, regression analyses using them can be mis-specified, leading to bias in
regression coefficients and model standard errors. This paper directly compares
measurement error model specifications to naive model specifications for a mortality
outcome in Texas Census tracts using Bayesian model specializations. The results show
that there is bias in the naive regression model results. We urge users of the ACS
summary file data to be aware of such bias as it can potentially impact interpretation of
model results and hypothesis tests.

Introduction
When the American Community Survey (ACS) first began in 2001, the program was
greeted with a mixture of excitement and skepticism. Those who were excited thought of
the value of (eventual) yearly or rolling averages of hundreds of different demographic,
social and economic indicators the survey would provide in areas as small as block
groups, without having to wait for the decennial census. The skeptics thought of the
difficulties in coverage that test cases of the survey faced, and the validity of the
estimates produced by the survey (Census Bureau 2012; Citro et al. 2007; Herman 2008;
McLaughlin et al. 2000). Since the initial publication of the ACS 2009 5-year summary
file, it has been used repeatedly in demographic research, both to portray population
changes, geographic variation in socioeconomic conditions, and as predictors in various
regression models of health and economic behavior both at the individual and aggregate
levels of analysis. It is with the latter of these uses that this paper is concerned. The
concern arises based not upon the ACS survey itself, nor necessarily with the published
estimates, but in the margins of error reported alongside the published estimates. These
margins of error contain valuable information as to the stability and information content
of the published estimates, however these margins of error (MOEs) are rarely if ever
formally incorporated into statistical analysis using the ACS. This is done, despite
decades of work by statisticians on the use of measurement error model specifications
that incorporate errors in measurement directly into the statistical models.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of incorporating measurement
errors from the ACS summary file directly in a statistical analysis, and compare the

results to a naive analysis, which excludes the MOEs. To accomplish this, we use as an
example recent small area estimates of mortality within the state of Texas and a variety of
demographic and socioeconomic variables from the ACS summary file.

Measurement error in the ACS
Researchers often employ ACS estimates in models as counts with no accounting for
measurement (sampling and non-response) error. When using geographic areas (such as
census tracts) as the unit of analysis, the size of measurement error will vary, potentially
quite dramatically, from one area to the next. Thus, two estimates may appear to be
substantially different, yet statistically, when we consider measurement error, we may not
be able to say they are different.
The Census bureau produces numerous guides to using ACS data. These guides
typically focus on the construction of demographic or economic estimates from the data.
They also specify how the Margins of Error (MOEs) should be used when describing the
estimates. These MOEs are a measure of how imprecise a particular estimate is. As
documented in other studies (Bazuin and Fraser 2013; Jurjevich et al. 2018; Spielman et
al. 2014, 2015) the errors in estimates grow in relative magnitude as the size of the
geographic area under estimation decreases (i.e. state level estimates are more stable than
counties, and counties are more stable than census tracts, with census block group
estimates being the least stable of all estimates). This is an effect of the ACS survey
sample size used to estimate the quantity of interest in the area of interest. For example,
estimating the minority population in a small rural county with a small minority

population would produce a higher variance estimate, because the sample size used
would be smaller than a larger population area. Additionally, in areas with harder to reach
populations, the ACS errors can also increase because sample sizes suffer due to nonresponse in the survey. With the smallest geographies present in the ACS summary file,
block groups have the largest margins of error.

Measurement error models in statistics
There is a well-documented literature on the effects of measurement error in
predictors on inference in linear and generalized linear models. In short, measurement
error in predictor variables lead to bias in parameter estimates and on estimated errors in
these parameters (Buonaccorsi 2010). Typically, model intercepts are over-estimated, and
the regression effects are under estimated in such situations. In addition, the variance
covariance matrices of these models are also incorrect, which leads to incorrect standard
errors for all model parameters, and ultimately to errors in the statistical tests which
depend on these estimates.
One model for accounting for measurement error in covariates is the Berkson
additive error model (Berkson 1950). This model states that if a predictor xobs is observed
with error ex then a model can be specified so the random variable Xtrue can be modeled as:
Xtrue = xobs + ex, with ex having mean 0 and variance œÉ2u. Specifically, this model assumes
that the true value of the variable and the error in the observed variable are independent
of one another. This model is used when aggregate or group-level characteristics are
assigned to individuals, in order to provide proxies for the individual-level variables that

are unmeasured. For example, using the median household income in a Census tract to
proxy the income of an individual residing within that tract.
The second common measurement error model is the classical measurement error
model. This model, in contrast to the Berkson error model, includes error in the
predictors themselves, versus the use of a group -level variable to proxy an individuallevel measurement. This model assumes that the error in the measurement and the true
value are independent of one another, meaning that the measurements themselves have
error. When using ACS data in an aggregate analysis, the classical error model seems
most appropriate, because we are not assigning group-level characteristics to individuals,
we are instead using the estimates and the MOEs measured for areas. Szpiro et al (2011)
describe in a very effective fashion how errors in measurement affect the inference in a
regression model. If we are using a simple linear regression model, the model is
originally:
ùë¶

Œ≤

Œ≤ ùë•

ùëí

But with measurement error in x, the model becomes:
ùë¶

Œ≤

Œ≤ ùë•

ùëí

ùë¢

Which now has error from the original model, plus error from the covariate, u. By
assuming the predictors in a model have no error, then the standard errors in a regression
model are estimated as
s.e. Œ≤

œÉ ùëãùëã

which only depends on the error in the outcome, œÉ , implied by the model. When
measurement error in the X‚Äôs is introduced, this formula is then incorrect. The exact

details of the addition of measurement error into the calculation of model standard errors
can be found in texts on the subject (Buonaccorsi 2010), but can best be seen by the
inclusion of the reliability ratio for the model parameter. The reliability ratio, Œª, is the
ratio of the variability in the true X‚Äôs, over the variance in their errors.
Œª

œÉ
œÉ

œÉ

In general, the bias in the regression coefficients themselves can be estimated as Œª*Œ≤, the
bias then attenuates the regression effects by the value Œª. In terms of the errors in the
model parameters, the standard errors should now be:
s.e. Œ≤

œÉ

œÉ

ùëãùëã

if one X is measured with error, while if all X‚Äôs are measured with error, the equation
become more complex, with the measurement errors being a variance covariance matrix
instead of a scalar. While this formula works well for a variable with homoscedastic
measurement error variance, incorporating heteroskedastic errors is not so clear within
this simple framework.
In general, the exclusion of measurement errors will bias the hypothesis tests
based on the bias introduced in the regression effects themselves, as well as the bias in
the uncorrected standard errors. This will lead to incorrect tests of model parameters and
incorrect interpretation of the model itself. Methods for correcting measurement error
have been described by other authors in the statistical and econometric literature (Arima
et al. 2016; Buonaccorsi 2010; R. J. Carroll et al. 2011; R. Carroll et al. 2006; Fuller
1987), and various methods of correction have been described including the SIMEX
method (R. J. Carroll et al. 1996; Wang et al. 1998).

Despite the availability of various models for measurement error, little has been
done on how the errors in ACS estimates influence findings in social science settings, a
recent publication by Orndahl and Wheeler (2018) have noted how the errors influence
the substantive interpretation of model results. In their article, Orndahl and Wheeler
describe that by ignoring the errors in the ACS variables included at the county level,
there were areas that appeared to cluster spatially in their analysis of suicide mortality.
After taking account of the errors in measurement, several of these areas were no longer
spatial clusters. While this finding is significant from an epidemiological standpoint, it
does not address the larger concerns that using predictor variables with errors
incorporates into any modeling strategy that uses the ACS. Another study by Napierala
and Denton (2017) shows how the index of dissimilarity used in segregation studies can
be sensitive to the errors in ACS estimates used to compute it. They describe that in areas
with smaller populations, or in areas with smaller populations of minorities, the index of
dissimilarity shows marked variation from its point estimate, and the confidence intervals
for the index are very wide in such places.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the effects of ignoring ACS measurement error
on the interpretation of regression coefficients. This paper fills a gap in the literature,
where no attention has been paid to the repercussions of using ACS estimates within
models and ignoring the measurement error in the estimates. Based on research from the
measurement error literature, we propose a relatively simple model that incorporates the

errors in all ACS estimates included in a model and show how the results of the
measurement error model compares to that of a na√Øve analysis, which ignores the errors
in measurement. The strategy for this analysis uses Bayesian modeling specifications,
which can accommodate measurement errors very directly (Orndahl and Wheeler 2018).
We use a model that does not incorporate measurement error (na√Øve) and a second that
incorporates measurement errors directly into the model. Through the Bayesian modeling
strategy, we can compare model parameter point estimates, standard errors and coverage
intervals for all parameters between the two approaches. This will allow us to measure
the relative bias in the na√Øve model. To illustrate these ideas, data on age and sex specific
mortality in Texas census tracts and counties are used, along with several ACS estimates
as predictor variables in the analysis. Two different levels of geography are used in order
to ascertain the relative bias in using small versus larger geographic areas, which have
been described elsewhere (Spielman et al. 2014; Sun and Wong 2010) as being a natural
source of larger errors in ACS estimates.
Two different levels of analysis are used in order to determine how much bias is
introduced by the errors in the ACS variables at small and larger geographic areas.
Spielman et. al. (2014) describe how census tracts in the ACS have much smaller sample
sizes on average than the 2000 Census summary file 3 samples, and this would also be
true for counties, but since counties are larger areas, the sample sizes will be larger as a
result. Thus, the errors in measurement at the tract level are expected to be greater in the
analysis of tracts than in the analysis of counties, but since both levels of analysis are
common in the health literature (Gant et al. 2014; Mode et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2015;

Yang and Jensen 2015), the authors believe that it is worthwhile to describe the bias
introduced at both levels of analysis.
Data
To illustrate the effects of measurement error on regression results, we use the 2015 5year ACS summary file measured at the census tract and county level for the state of
Texas. Following protocols for small area mortality rate estimation, we limit the tracts in
the analysis to those with at least 5,000 residents, and with non-zero populations at risk at
each age group. The outcome considered in this analysis is age and sex specific all-cause
mortality. Data on individual death certificates were obtained from the Texas Department
of State Health Services (DSHS) through an IRB approved data request from the years
2011 to 2015. These data are geocoded to 2010 census tracts and aggregated over the 5year period by 10-year age intervals and sex of the deceased. Using ACS 2011-2015 5year population estimates for corresponding age and sex categories as denominators
resulted in a total of 20 rates for each tract and a total of 70,871 rates for the state for the
tract-level analysis and 4568 rates for the 254 counties in the state. For the tract analysis,
we take a random sample of 15,000 tracts within the state, a sample of approximately 1/3
of all tracts, representing 214 of the 254 counties. For each respective level of the
analysis, the observation unit is either the tract-specific age and sex count of deaths, or
for the county-level analysis, each observation is the county-specific age and sex count of
deaths.
This paper is not trying to test a theoretical perspective, per se, so predictor variables are
chosen to be representative of other ecological analyses of mortality in the United States

(Dwyer-Lindgren et al. 2016; Sparks et al. 2009; Sparks and Sparks 2010; Yang and
Jensen 2015). We use data from the 2011 - 2015 5-Year ACS summary file demographic
profile tables, which overlaps the period when the mortality data are observed. The
demographic profile tables combine information from multiple ACS detailed tables and
provide pre-calculated percentages and rates with associated margins of error. For
predictors in the regression models, we use the home vacancy rate, the proportion of the
population over age 25 with a college degree, the proportion of the population that is nonHispanic black, the proportion of households below the poverty line and the proportion of
the population that is insured. All variables are expressed as proportions with the margins
of error expressed as 90% margins of error for each proportion.
Methods
We estimate two types of regression models to document the effects of incorporating
measurement error on the regression results. All models are specified as a Negative
Binomial regression model for the age and sex specific mortality rates, with a population
offset (n), as:

We first consider a na√Øve regression model, where no measurement error is incorporated.
This na√Øve approach represents the standard/traditional approach most researchers would
apply when using the ACS - derived estimates as predictors in a regression model, where
no uncertainty in the estimates is incorporated into the analysis. The second model is a

Classical measurement error model implementation, with measurement errors in all the
ACS - derived predictors are included directly in the model. This model uses a Bayesian
measurement error specification of the additive Classical error model. This strategy
assumes the true value of the ACS estimates can be modeled using a latent variable from
a Normal distribution, with a mean equal to the observed point estimate and a standard
deviation equal to the estimated standard error of the ACS point estimate (s.e.(ACS
estimate) = MOE/1.645)).

Models are estimated using Bayesian model specifications using the brms package
(B√ºrkner 2017) and the Stan modeling language (Carpenter et al. 2017; Gelman et al.
2015) for R 3.5.2 (R Core Team and R Development Core Team 2018).
Since a Bayesian modeling strategy is used, all model parameters are given prior
distributions according to recommended best practices (Burkner, 2017; Gelman 2004;
Gelman et al., 2015; Gelman et al., 2017). Flat priors are assigned to all the population
level parameters (Œ≤, Œ≥, ùúì ). Two independent Markov chains were used, and models were
burned in for 3.000 iterations, followed by another 3,000 iterations for sampling of the
parameters. Models showed signs of convergence with all model parameters having Rhat
values of 1 (Gelman and Rubin, 1992). Models are summarized in terms of the posterior
means of the parameters and 95% Bayesian credible intervals.
Results

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the outcome variable, and the ACS predictors,
and their associated standard errors for both the county and tract levels of analysis. As
expected, the level of error in the county-level estimates is much lower than that of the
tract-level analysis. The average number of deaths is much higher for counties than tracts,
with only 2 deaths on average in each tract during the period. There are also noticeable
differences in the means of several of the estimates between the two levels of analysis,
with the % Non-Hispanic black, the % with a college education and the poverty rate all
being lower in the county-level data, and the vacancy rate being higher on average in
counties.
<TABLE 1 HERE>
County-level analysis
Turning to the county-level regression analysis, Table 2 presents the results from the
Bayesian analysis. Results are summarized in terms of their posterior means, posterior
standard errors and 95% Bayesian credible intervals for all regression model parameter
estimates. Also presented are the age group effects.
<TABLE 2 HERE>
The results of the analysis are summarized again in Figure 1, which presents the posterior
marginal distributions for each of the regression parameters in the analysis. The visual
interpretation of the model results is perhaps easier to discuss. The effects of the various
regressors are presented for both the na√Øve and the measurement error models. The red,
solid lines represent the marginal for the measurement error model parameters, and the
solid, green lines represent the marginal for the na√Øve model. In most case, the marginals

are similar, but some parameters indicate some degree of bias in the na√Øve models. Bias is
typically thought to decrease the effect size for a predictor, but bias can also inflate the
effect sizes (Loken and Gelman 2017).
<FIGURE 1 HERE>
The credible intervals for each parameter, from Table 1 and the marginals from Figure 1,
combine to show the differences between the two models. The %Non-Hispanic black
parameter is significant in both models, and the marginals are nearly identical. In the
measurement error model the point estimate for the parameter is larger 2.35% larger and
the standard error of the estimate is 6.43% larger. The effect of the vacancy rate is 19%
larger in the ME model than in the na√Øve model and the error is nearly 16% larger, while
both suggest the effect is negative and significant. The education variable shows strong
similarity between both models, with the ME model having a point estimate that is 9%
larger and a standard error that is 15.8% larger than the na√Øve model. The effect of the
poverty rate in the both models model suggests there is no significant relationships
between poverty and mortality, while the ME model‚Äôs point estimate is 58% larger than
the na√Øve model, and the standard error is 68.9% larger. The effect of the rate of insurance
coverage is positive and significant in the na√Øve model, while the ME model is not
significant at the 95% level, also the parameter estimate is 29% larger in the ME model
than the na√Øve model and the standard error is 67% larger in the ME model. Finally, the
‚Äúfixed‚Äù effect of the difference between males and females is not significant in either
model, and the ME model has a 9% lower estimate than the na√Øve model, with very little
difference in the standard errors. While not plotted, the marginals for the age pattern of

mortality are very consistent across the two models, in both the point estimates and the
errors in the parameter estimates. Overall, the results from the models including
measurement error show higher variation in the parameter estimates, larger effect sizes
and a tendency towards bias in the na√Øve model estimates, which agrees with the
measurement error model literature.
Tract-level analysis
Table 3 presents the results from the two models for the tract-level analysis. As in Table 2,
results are summarized in terms of their posterior means, posterior standard errors and 95%
Bayesian credible intervals for all regression model parameter estimates. Also presented
are the age group effects.
<TABLE 3 HERE>
The results of the analysis are summarized again in Figure 2, which presents the posterior
marginal distributions for each of the regression parameters in the analysis. The effects of
the various regressors are presented for both the na√Øve and the measurement error models.
The red, solid lines represent the marginal for the measurement error model parameters,
and the solid, green lines represent the marginal for the na√Øve model. In comparison to the
county level analysis, there are many notable differences between the models in this case.
In most case, the marginals are very different, and most parameters indicate some degree
of bias in the na√Øve models.
The credible intervals for each parameter, from Table 3 and the marginals from Figure 2,
combine to show the differences between the two models. The %Non-Hispanic black
parameter is significant in both models, and the marginals are very similar. In the

measurement error model, the point estimate for the parameter is larger 16.7% larger and
the standard error of the estimate is 13.8% larger. The effect of the vacancy rate is 53%
larger in the ME model than in the na√Øve model and the error is 50.1% larger, while both
suggest the effect is negative and significant. The education variable shows strong
similarity between both models, with the ME model having a point estimate that is 15.4%
larger and a standard error that is 21.1% larger than the na√Øve model. The effect of the
poverty rate in the both models model suggests there is a significant relationship between
tract-level poverty and mortality, and the ME model‚Äôs point estimate is 65.8% larger than
the na√Øve model, and the standard error is 56.6% larger. The effect of the rate of insurance
coverage is positive and significant in both models, and the ME model parameter
estimate is 49.5% larger in the ME model than the na√Øve model and the standard error is
35.8% larger in the ME model. Finally, the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù effect of the difference between males
and females is significant in both models, and both models show nearly identical effects.
While not plotted, the marginals for the age pattern of mortality are very consistent across
the two models, with an average difference of the ME model coefficients being 4.25%
larger in the ME models and the parameter errors being 1.52% larger in the ME models.
Overall, the results from the models including measurement error show higher levels of
variation in the parameter estimates, larger effect sizes and a notable bias in the na√Øve
model estimates for the ACS variables.
<FIGURE 2 HERE>
Discussion

Results from the analysis presented here show three main effects. First, when using ACS
data as predictors in county-level analyses, the estimates produce parameter estimates
that show some tendency toward bias in the na√Øve models, with larger uncertainty in the
parameter estimates. Secondly, in the tract level analysis, the biases in the ACS variable
effects are much larger, as are the estimates of the uncertainty of the model estimates.
Thirdly, the fixed effects (age and sex) are consistently estimated in both analyses and
appear to have very small bias in both the point estimates and the parameter uncertainty.
This confirms what is suggested in the measurement error model literature, where the
standard errors and ultimately point-estimate based hypothesis tests for the regression
effects are biased in such models. This presents a dangerous situation, as inference from
these models would be incorrect. In both the county and tract level analysis, the results
from the na√Øve model, in terms of the significance of the model effects is preserved in the
measurement error model for all but one parameter (% insured in the county-level model),
even though the measurement error model produced larger standard errors for all
parameters.
In conclusion, based on this analysis, we would recommend that those using the
ACS point estimates in a regression model setting seriously consider incorporating
measurement error into their analysis, because the estimates of the parameters tend to be
downwardly biased and the standard errors of the estimates too small, which could
conflate point-estimate based hypothesis tests. This result holds particularly for the tract
level analyses, which show a large degree of bias in both the effect sizes and the
parameter uncertainty measures.

Future work in this area will also investigate these effects in the contexts of
multilevel models for a variety of outcomes.
