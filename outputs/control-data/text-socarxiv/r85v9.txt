Abstract
This article presents a comprehensive survey of applications of Henri Lefebvre’s theorizations on space in the Turkish
context. Through an intensive search and screening of the literature, this article “maps” relevant studies in terms of research
topic, geographic and historical scope, and the conceptual framework and concepts used while presenting the general trends
and patterns of applications of Lefebvrean space frameworks in the Turkish context. According to the main argument of
the study, although there have been intensive applications of various Lefebvrean conceptualizations on space for the case of
Turkey, in most of the relevant scholarship, the focus has been on the spatial triad framework or its various components,
rather than on a systematic and comprehensive contextualization of the theory.

Introduction
As Stuart Elden notes, in the 1990s, one could speak of a
“renaissance of interest” in the work of Henri Lefebvre
(1991), since it was in the 1990s that the English-speaking
world finally had access to some of his most important works
(Elden, 2001, p. 809), with The Production of Space representing Lefebvre’s most important set of theorizations and
conceptualizations on space. It is in this work that Lefebvre
presents his theory of the production of space, and where one
finds his most comprehensive and systematic discussions on
space. Perhaps, the 1991 translation and publication of this
work was one of the main reasons that in the Englishspeaking world, “much of the attention to Lefebvre’s work
has been in the field of geography, or related areas such as
urban sociology or cultural studies” (Elden, 2001, p. 809), as
conceptualizations presented there appear convenient and
productive for these fields.
The initial propositions of The Production of Space have
been expanded by a wide range of scholars (Brenner &
Elden, 2009; Elden, 2001, 2004; Elden, Lebas, & Kofman,
2003; Erdi-Lelandais, 2014c; Goonewardena, Kipfer,
Milgrom, & Schmid, 2008; Gottdiener, 1987, 1993; Gregory,
1995; Kipfer, 2002; Kipfer, Saberi, & Wieditz, 2013;
Merrifield, 2013; Shields, 2005; Soja, 1996; Stanek, 2011;
Zieleniec, 2007), thus nowadays Lefebvrean theoretical
propositions and concepts on space have become the core of

any scholarship pertaining to theoretical and practical aspects
of space and spatializations.
With Lefebvrean production of space theory becoming
popular in emergent scholarship pertaining to space and spatializations, particularly in the scholarship embarking upon
employing Lefebvre’s various concepts into particular cases,
one can find all kind of interesting explications and contextualizations of respective notions, like the notion of abstract
space or representational space, contextualizations, which
frequently detach the respective notions from the structure
and context of the larger theory, and contextualize with
respect to research in geography or urban sociology, yet
without much consideration given to Lefebvre’s critique to
such an approach: approach producing either “mere descriptions which never achieve analytical, much less theoretical,
status, or else fragments and cross-sections of space”
(Lefebvre, 1991, p. 7). Indeed, the dominance of that
approach was one of Lefebvre’s departure points for embarking upon his “unitary theory” of space. As a result, year by
year, one sees a growing body of literature, especially case

studies, which try to apply various concepts elaborated by
Lefebvre, in different geographical and historical contexts.
In The Production of Space (1991), Lefebvre’s production
of space theory is composed of two main structurally interrelated frameworks: the first refers to the periodization of
space framework and consists of absolute space, sacred
space, historical space, abstract space, contradictory space,
and differential space; the second refers to the spatial triad
framework and consists of spatial practices (perceived
space), representations of space (conceived space), and representational space (lived space).
The Lefebvrean periodization of space framework
although is considered by some as “stereotypical, linear,
Eurocentric modelling of historical progress” (Shields,
2005, p. 170), notwithstanding, the framework appears as
Lefebvre’s one of the most unique contributions to the general theory of space and the only available coherent framework to understand “the long history of space,” which
according to Lefebvre should “be distinguished from an
inventory of things in space (or what has recently been
called material culture or civilization), as also from ideas
and discourse about space” (Lefebvre, 1991, p. 116), the
inventory of things in space appearing as the space of history. Moreover, according to Lefebvre (1991), the history
of space must deal with “modes of production as generalities covering specific societies with their particular histories and institutions” (p. 48). Thus, in this respect, one sees
a coherence between Lefebvrean periodization of space
framework and the general history of modes of production
in Marxism or as Boer (2015) points, The Production of
Space “seeks to refashion Marxist periodization in terms of
space” (p. 95).1 As a result, in the Lefebvrean periodization
of space framework, absolute space corresponds to tribal
(hunting and gathering) societies and Neolithic agriculture,
sacred space pertains to Asiatic mode of production and/or
Feudalism, historical space relates to the ancient or
classical mode of production (the polis or oligarchic slaveholding society), abstract space appears as the dominant
space of Early Capitalism, contradictory space corresponds
to the dominant space of Late Capitalism, and differential
space is an imaginative proposition by Lefebvre that corresponds to collective and communal association of
Communism where difference and lived experience are valued (Boer, 2015, p. 96).2
Another major constitutive element of Lefebvrean theory
of space is the spatial triad framework, which also appears as
the most popular element of the theory among the scholarship referring to the theory. With the triad, consisting of three
interrelated elements, namely spatial practices, representations of space, and representational space, Lefebvre (1991)
in his “unitary theory” of space aims to capture the physical,
mental, and social “fields” of space (p. 11). At first, appearing as another unique proposition of Lefebvre, the triad, as

SAGE Open
Harvey (2006, p. 279) notes, is not the original proposition of
Lefebvre, but Lefebvre developed this framework by further
expanding the propositions of Cassirer (1944), who considers human spatial experience consisting of tripartite sets of
organic, perceptual, and symbolic spaces.
Thus, although the spatial triad framework appears as an
important proposition of Lefebvre, as a conceptual framework, its full capacity can be grasped only when considered
together with the periodization of space framework.
Similarly, the periodization of space framework is not quite
an authentic proposition, as it mostly corresponds to the
dominant modes of production in human history accepted by
Marxism. Thus, Lefebvre’s theory appears to be an authentic
theoretical construct, once the above-mentioned frameworks
are considered together as a unity.
It is in the above-elaborated background that, in the existing large body of literature contextualizing the above-noted
frameworks across various contexts, one sees that the spatial
triad framework (or its various constituent elements) is the
most frequently referenced Lefebvre’s concepts; there is a
frequent reduction of Lefebvre’s theory into the spatial triad
framework or selective adoption and appropriation of the
various elements of the triad, while the periodization of
space framework (or its various components) is not used frequently as a framework for analysis or is disregarded completely. And as argued above, Lefebvre’s theory of the
production of space appears as a unique framework only
when both the periodization of space and the spatial triad
components are considered as structurally interrelated units
of the theory. Moreover, only when these two frameworks
are considered together can we recognize Lefebvre’s work as
one of the most authentic and original contributions to the
theory of space. Indeed, while the spatial triad or its various
components are being considered detached from Lefebvre’s
general theory of the production of space, it could be argued
that such applications have more of a descriptive functionality than a capacity for unveiling the underlying relationships
and process pertinent to social space.
The context of Turkey is an interesting case for examining
these propositions. A preliminary screening of the literature
that applies and contextualizes the Lefebvrean conceptualizations on space in the Turkey context shows that although
Lefebvrean conceptualizations on space have become popular in recent Turkey-related scholarship, it consists mostly of
applications of the spatial triad framework or its various elements. Thus, this article presents a comprehensive survey of
Lefebvre’s theory of the production of space in the Turkish
context, a survey of literature that “maps” the applications of
Lefebvre’s theorizations about space in the context of Turkey.
The article below presents the logic, criteria, and steps of the
survey conducted. In the discussion, the article summarizes
general patterns and trends in the applications of Lefebvre’s
theory of the production of space to the Turkish context.

The Logic, Steps, and Criteria of
the Survey
To “map” applications of Lefebvre’s theory of space in the
Turkish context, several search criteria were set in advance.
Since the aim was to “map” the state of the art in the contextualization of Lefebvre’s theory of space within the Turkish
context, several wide-scope keywords like Lefebvre, Turkey,
and space were used for the preliminary literature search.3
Furthermore, to capture all relevant publications, English
and Turkish language publications as well as “search in fulltext” options were employed.4 Since the selected keywords
were wide in scope, the second stage of the search entailed
evaluating titles, abstracts, and/or the full texts to further narrow the results to those that focus on the context of Turkey
and involve the contextualization of various Lefebvrean concepts. Indeed, as noted above, since The Production of Space
represents Lefebvre’s most consistent elaboration of his production of space theory, and because it is also where he tried
to present the most comprehensive conceptual framework
underlying that theory, the basic criteria for the relevancy of
any publication was whether it referred to this work.5
Many publications on urban studies with a focus on
Turkey intensively mobilize the Lefebvrean concept of the
right to the city and most of the research focuses first on this
concept before discussing and contextualizing Lefebvre’s
theory on space or its constitutive elements. In this regard,
although a more inclusionary survey of Lefebvrean propositions in Turkey-related academic publications bears important theoretical and practical implications, we excluded the
mobilizations of this concept from our survey due to several
key reasons. First of all, as we argued above, Lefebvre aims
to present a “unitary theory” of space, and in this regard, in
The Production of Space, one sees quite systematic and comprehensive conceptualizations and frameworks aimed at
elaboration of such a theory. Those frameworks are the periodization of space frame and the spatial triad. While the
notion of the right to the city was proposed by Lefebvre
(1968) earlier than The Production of Space (Lefebvre,
1974), interestingly, in the later, there is no any referral to the
notion of the right to the city. Thus, the right to the city, as a
clear-cut concept, cannot be considered as a part of the theory of space. Hence, the mobilization of this concept in the
context of Turkey was left out of the survey. Moreover, compared to other Lefebvrean notions, the notion of the right to
the city bears a multitude of interpretations, and the analysis
of works pertaining to its mobilization in Turkey-related
scholarship requires another large-scale survey to trace its
applications and interpretations. Besides, the concept of the
right to the city goes beyond the status of being a scholarly
notion and is rather a “proper and easily deployable” notion.
Thus, to trace its mobilization in a particular context requires
not only another large-scale survey but also another hypothesis and approach. Because, according to our hypothesis,
Lefebvre’s interrelated propositions on space (unitary theory

on space) have been contextualized by the existing scholarship on Turkey rather fragmentary, and the aim of the current
survey is to expose such fragmentary contextualization of
the theory. Indeed, another survey aimed at “mapping” the
contextualizations of the notion of the right to the city in
Turkey-related scholarship, the struggles for the right to the
city in Turkey and the role and motivations of various actors,
particularly the role of researchers in knowledge production
and dissemination, could provide important insights into
theoretical and practical terms.
Since the survey aimed to reveal contextualizations of
Lefebvrean concepts in the context of Turkey, another criterion for narrowing down the search results entailed focusing
on the literature itself, which, instead of general references to
Lefebvre’s theory and related general propositions, tries to
operationalize and apply Lefebvrean concepts. In other
words, the main aim here was to eliminate those works that
only elaborated propositions, such as “every society produces its own space” and “social space is a social product,”
and focus on works that were actual contextualizations of
concepts and frameworks such as the spatial triad, periodization of space, or their various elements.
To “map” the state of the art of the Lefebvrean production
of space framework in the context of Turkey, a final listed
relevant literature (see Supplemental Appendix)6 was evaluated based on the following questions:
1.

2.
3.

How is Lefebvre’s theory of space being discussed in
the study? What kind of readings of the theory (if
any) exists in the study? Does the theory of space or
its various concepts appear as the main framework
for the study?
Which Lefebvrean framework or concepts are being
applied in the study?
What are the geographical and historical scopes of
the studies? Or of the cases on which these studies
are focused?7

Lefebvrean Concepts of Space in the
Context of Turkey: General Trends
and Patterns
An analysis of 147 relevant studies showed that since 2000,
there has been a steady increase in the number of works that
apply various Lefebvrean concepts. Interestingly, after 2014,
when The Production of Space appeared for the first time in
Turkish translation (Lefebvre, 2014), the number of relevant
works increased substantially (Figure 1).8
As the analysis shows, Lefebvrean conceptualizations on
space have frequently focused on the Turkish context. In
addition, these conceptualizations have been contextualized
across a wide range of scholarship. Thus, the literature shows
variations not only in terms of topics but also in terms of
spatial and historical scope. Lefebvrean conceptualizations

have been contextualized in such research fields as literature
(Kutlar, 2005; Mirze, 2005; Salman, 2015; Şişmanoğlu,
2003; Yeşil, 2016), communication (Demirkol, 2015), cinema (Aslan, 2014; Atabey, 2010; Ercan, 2011; Sarı, 2010;
Uzunali, 2015), performance (Kılıç-Çalgıcı, 2013; Selen,
2010, 2012), and gender and queer studies (Pasin, 2014;
Selen, 2010, 2012). However, the most frequent application
of the Lefebvrean concepts is in the fields such as architecture and urban studies (Y. Baş, 2010; Çınar, 2014; Gegelioğlu
& Aydınlı, 2014; Karakaya, 2010; Kaypak, 2014a, 2014b;
Koçak, 2008; Turhanoglu, 2010; C. S. Wilson, 2007) and
urban social movements (Batuman, 2003; Erdi-Lelandais,
2013, 2014a, 2014b; Ergin, 2006, 2014; Fırat, 2011); as these
fields of research are traditionally more directly related to
space as an “object” of inquiry, this pattern seems quite natural. Of particular note in a Turkish context was the application of Lefebvrean conceptualizations in numerous analyses
of the 2013 Occupy Gezi Movement (Batuman, 2014, 2015a;
Castagno, 2015; E. Erol, 2014; D. Erol, 2015; Eryılmaz,
2016; Hornstein, 2015; Işıklılar, 2016; Karasulu, 2014;
Koyuncu, 2015; Şengül, 2015; Yılmaz, 2015).
Another topic frequently elaborated in Lefebvrean concepts was the urban renewal projects and processes (Basa,
2015b; Baydar, Komesli, Yılmaz, & Kılınç, 2016;
Demirtaş-Milz & Saraçoğlu, 2015; El-Kazaz, 2014; Eranıl,
Tuna, & Demirtaş-Milz, 2015; Önder, 2012; Penpecioglu,
2012) underway in Turkey since the early 2000s.
Furthermore, a significant body of literature (Atıcı, 2014;
Casier, 2011; F. Gür, 2006; Pasin, 2009, 2014, 2016;
Pekasil, 2016; Sarıtaş, 2007; Turan, 2011) was found to
apply Lefebvrean frameworks while focusing on singular
events, cases, buildings, and projects. Indeed, most of the
works mentioned above, for example, works in literature

studies and cinema studies, should also be considered as a
part of this last group.
The focus of the existing studies presents an interesting
pattern with respect to spatial scale and time frame. Regarding
spatial scales, approximately 80% of studies focus on
Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir cities, thus replicating the general thrust of urban studies literature in Turkey, and its concern for major cities of Western portion of the country.
Regarding the time frame of the studies, a significant portion
of them emphasized the post-2000 period. However, another
frequently analyzed period was the early Republican period
in Turkey (1930-1940). The third historical period that was
frequently analyzed was the period between 1960 and 1970
(Figure 2).
Arguably, as stipulated above, the Lefebvrean theory (of
the production) of space in terms of structure consists of two
main interrelated frameworks: (a) the periodization of space
framework, consisting of consecutive periods of absolute,
sacred, historical, abstract, and contradictory spaces, and (b)
the spatial triad framework, consisting of spatial practices,
representations of space, and representational space. When
considered together, these two interrelated frameworks make
the explanatory capacity of the Lefebvrean theory both powerful and unique.
When analyzing how those two frameworks and their
various conceptual elements are being applied in the context
of Turkey, several dominant trends and patterns in the contextualization of the theory could be discerned.
First, most of the relevant literature draws only upon the
spatial triad of Lefebvre’s framework (Ağlargöz, 2016;
Altay, 2004; Basa, 2015a, 2016; Baydar et al., 2016; Ceylan,
2015; El-Kazaz, 2014; Eranıl et al., 2015; Ergin, 2006;
Erkılıç & Bayraktar, 2015; Gegelioğlu & Aydınlı, 2014;

Khakee & Grassini, 2015; Koyuncu, 2015; Kulözü, 2008;
Önder, 2012; Salah, 2013; Sandıkcı, 2015; Turhanoglu,
2010; Yılmaz, 2015; Yüksekli, 2013) or upon one or two elements of the spatial triad itself (Akaslan, 2006; Aslan, 2012,
2014; Ateş, 2015; Basa, 2015b; Batuman, 2014; Berber,
2010; F. A. Demirtaş, 2000; Gulhan, 2014; Jongerden, 2007;
Kılıç-Çalgıcı, 2013; Mert, 2013; Mirze, 2005; Özgün, 2012;
Pasin, 2013; Salman, 2015; Serin, 2016; Şişmanoğlu, 2003;
Tirben, 2007; Turan, 2011; Z. S. Uludağ, 1998; C. S. Wilson,
2007; Yildiz, 2016). That said, in studies more generally,
there is usually no contextualization or reference to
Lefebvre’s periodization of space framework. Due to the topics they tend to focus on, the periodization of space framework tends not to be a relevant framework for some studies.
Interestingly, even studies that cover long historical periods,
and where the periodization of space framework would have
been a useful framework for analysis, it is still usually
neglected. Instead, the analysis is conducted within the generally accepted periodization of Turkish political history.

Thus, analyses that refer to Lefebvre, instead of revealing the
history of space, reveal the space of history, an issue pointed
out several times by Lefebvre (1991) himself (pp. 46, 110111, 122).
Another dominant pattern relates to the nature of elaboration and contextualization of elements of the spatial triad. The
spatial triad framework (along with its various elements)
detached from Lefebvre’s general theory of space, with each
of the triad’s elements also detached from the triad, results in
convenient concepts for the analysis of various topics.9
According to Lefebvre (1991), representational space is the
“space” of “some artists and perhaps of those, such as a few
writers and philosophers” (p. 39); spatial practice “embraces
production and reproduction, and the particular locations and
spatial sets characteristic of each social formation” (p. 33),
whereas the representation of space is defined as “conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers” (p. 38). Lefebvre’s
terse descriptions offer “convenient” definitions for analyzing
say a literary work (i.e., a novel or poem) in terms of

6
representational space, an architectural project in terms of the
representation of space, or for using urban space or any particular set of locations in terms of spatial practices. It should
be noted that in the context of Turkey, a majority of the relevant literature contextualizes Lefebvre’s spatial triad and its
various elements in this way. Thus, it could be argued that
such an approach, if it only aims to analyze a literary work, or
an architectural project, if it only facilitates the daily use of
particular spatial sets, using Lefebvre’s concepts, that are
nonetheless detached from his general theory of (the production of) space, or employ elements of the triad independently
of the triad itself, fits into Lefebvre’s own critique. According
to Lefebvre, intellectual labor under the present mode of production, such as material labor, is subjected to endless division. Consequently, space is continuously being fragmented,
never able to unite, and as a result, “we are thus confronted by
an indefinite multitude of spaces, each one piled upon, or perhaps contained within” (Lefebvre, 1991, p. 8). Another
important argument against this kind of approach refers to the
nature of Lefebvre’s theory itself, a Marxist theory that places
production and reproduction at its core. Thus, any conceptual
element from such a theory, if detached from its actual context, runs a risk of becoming nothing more than a convenient
metaphor, with only a descriptive function.
Finally, the last issue to be elaborated relates to whether
elements of the spatial triad are worth using if they are
detached from the theory or the triad itself. For example,
with respect to the spatial practice element of the spatial
triad, it seems that the field of geography, both in terms of
conceptual apparatus and method, offers functional and productive frameworks for analyzing spatial practices. Toward
this end, Hägerstraand’s (1970) insights are an important
example. Accordingly, if a study aims to elaborate an aspect
of social space and fragments the integral nature of Lefebvre’s
theory by detaching its various concepts from the theory—a
theory with an interrelated conceptual structure that appears
as a unity—for the sake of such an inquiry, a search for “convenient” concepts could be conducted elsewhere.
Regarding the Lefebvrean periodization of space framework, the following general patterns could be discerned.
First, there is frequent discussion related to various elements
of this framework, first and foremost is the concern for
notions of abstract and contradictory spaces, absent any
mention however of the Lefebvrean history of space framework (i.e., this framework is not much discussed in the literature). Second, the notion of abstract space is sometimes
reduced instead of the representation of space (conceived
space). Although the abstract space of capitalism entails
abstract representations of space, it is more accurate to consider the notion of abstract space as a period in the history of
space and different from the abstract representation of space
notion used by experts, planners, and technocrats. Third, in
the Turkish context, the contextualization of the notion of
abstract space acts principally as a kind of deus ex machina.
According to Lefebvre, the production of space in capitalism

SAGE Open
is essentially a production of abstract space. As a result,
within the relevant literature, to define the space in various
contexts, there is a frequent use of this notion. However, how
the production of this abstract space takes place, what aspects
predetermine its “abstractness,” and questions about
“abstractness” itself and its corresponding characteristics are
not very elaborated. Thus, the notion of abstract space serves
as a “convenient” shorthand for researchers, a descriptive
deus ex machina helping researchers to explain anything that
concerns the production of space in capitalism.
One important aspect of the literature about Lefebvre’s
periodization of space framework refers not so much to its
application but rather with how it was being read. In particular, this reading isolates a framework consisting of consecutive periods of production of absolute, abstract, and
differential spaces, while notions of sacred, historical, and
contradictory spaces are neglected. In Lefebvre’s work,
notions of sacred and historical spaces are not emphasized;
furthermore, there are no separate chapters or subheadings
for them such as those for absolute, abstract, and differential
spaces. Consequently, more superficial readings tend to miss
these notions. In addition, Lefebvre has elaborated complicated notions of abstract and contradictory spaces. Moreover,
contradictory space could also be read as a particular period
of abstract space associated with advanced capitalism.
However, differentiating between these two concepts is
important, as the space of industrial capitalism and that of
advanced capitalism are quite different from one another.
That said, the existing literature contains applications of
the Lefebvrean conceptualizations and frameworks, which, in
their respective contexts, appear to be a relatively more systematic and comprehensive referral to the above-elaborated
concepts and go beyond their fragmentary use. In other words,
those works approach the respective theoretical frameworks
in a more consistent way, especially to the spatial triad framework, without fragmenting its various elements for the sake
of analysis. Among those works—indeed, one of the earlier
works employing Lefebvrean spatial concepts and frameworks—is Ali Ekber Doğan’s (2005) study focusing on the
case of Kayseri city and analyzing Islamist municipalism and
the production of space during 1994-2004. Other examples of
such works include Neslihan Demirtaş’s (2007) analysis of
squatting (gecekondu) history in Turkey, focusing on the case
of the Boğaziçi Neighborhood of Mamak District in Ankara;
İlker Cörüt’s (2015) ethnographic research on the assimilation strategies of the Justice and Development Party and the
production of space in Hakkâri, focusing on the compulsory
public service law for doctors; Seher Şen’s (2008) study of
modernization, informal practices, and urbanity in Ankara
during the early Republican period; Feryal Aysin Koçak’s
(2008) study of the production of urban space in Ankara;
Demirtaş-Milz and Saraçoğlu’s (2015) study of the transformation of Kadifekale squatter settlements in Izmir, focusing
on an urban renewal project; Çağrı Eryılmaz’s (2016) study
of the 2013 Gezi Movement, focusing on the production of

7

Ghulyan
space from below against the space produced by neoliberal
policies; Nezihe Başak Ergin’s (2014) study of post-2010
urban social movements, examining the ways of resistance,
their associated patterns, and dynamics with respect to urban
transformation projects in Istanbul; and finally, Işıl Gülkök’s
(2013) study of the production of sidewalks in Ankara
between the period of 1923 and 2013. Indeed, most of these
studies appear not only as systematic applications of the spatial triad framework and each of its constitutive elements but
also in these works, one can see contextualizations of such
Lefebvrean notions as the notions of abstract space (Cörüt,
2015; Demirtaş-Milz & Saraçoğlu, 2015; N. Demirtaş, 2007;
Ergin, 2014; Eryılmaz, 2016; Gülkök, 2013; Koçak, 2008;
Şen, 2008), contradictory space (Doğan, 2005), or differential
space (Eryılmaz, 2016). Finally, the body of writings by
Bülent Batuman should also be mentioned. Batuman (2003,
2005, 2006, 2008, 2014, 2015a, 2015b), in his writings, offers
interesting applications of various Lefebvrean concepts.
Although Batuman’s works are not a comprehensive and systematic application of Lefebvrean concepts, those works do
reflect a productive and unique contextualization of the relevant theorizations in the Turkish context.10

Conclusion
As this survey has shown, Lefebvrean conceptualizations of
space appear frequently in Turkey-related scholarship and as
variously contextualized notions. Moreover, the applications
of such concepts appear across a wide range of scholarship,
such as literature, cinema, and gender and queer studies.
However, the most frequent application of Lefebvrean concepts occurs in the fields such as architecture and urban studies and in urban social movements. An especially interesting
finding was of the frequent application of Lefebvrean conceptualizations in an analysis of the 2013 Occupy Gezi
Movement.
Existing studies demonstrate an interesting pattern with
respect to spatial scale and time frame, such that approximately 80% of studies focus on various spatial scales of
Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir cities. This pattern replicates a
feature characteristic of urban studies literature in Turkey,
namely a focus on the largest cities of western Turkey:
Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Regarding the time frame focus
of these studies, a significant portion of them concentrated
on the post-2000 period. Another frequently analyzed period
was the early period of the Turkish Republic (1930-1940). In
terms of frequency, the third most popular historical period
for analysis was the period between 1960 and 1970.
According to the main assumption of the article, in The
Production of Space (1991), the Lefebvrean production of
space theory consists of two structurally interrelated main
frameworks, namely, the periodization of space framework
(consisting of absolute space, sacred space, historical space,
abstract space, contradictory space, and differential space)
and the spatial triad framework (consisting of spatial

practices, representations of space, and representational
space). Moreover, these two frameworks, when considered
together, make the explanatory capacity of the Lefebvrean
theory both more powerful and unique. In this regard, according to the survey, it appears that the spatial triad framework
(and its various elements) is the most frequently referenced
Lefebvrean conceptualization found in the Turkey-related
literature, whereas the periodization of space framework
(and its various components) is not being used frequently as
a framework of analysis. Moreover, nearly all studies, even
those which have a relatively longer historical scope, conduct their analysis within the generally accepted periodization of Turkish political history. Thus, analyses that refer the
Lefebvrean framework, instead of focusing on the history of
space, focus on the space of history.
Within the literature that refers to the periodization of
space framework, or to notions of abstract and contradictory
spaces, there is no reference to the Lefebvrean history of
space framework, that is, this framework is not much discussed in the relevant literature. Moreover, the notion of
abstract space is frequently reduced to the notion of a representation of space (conceived space), or it is used as a kind of
deus ex machina, a convenient shorthand for the “explanation” of anything that concerns the production of space in
capitalism.
Thus, in the case of recent Turkey-related scholarship,
applications of Lefebvrean space theory are mostly fragmentary and related to partial readings of the theory and to applications of the theory’s conceptual elements as convenient
tools in an analysis rather than treating the theory with its
concepts and frameworks as a structural unity. That said,
within the literature, there are also interesting and productive
applications of the Lefebvrean conceptualizations and frameworks to various spatial scales, and historical contexts and
cases.

Notes
1. For a detailed account on the timeline of Lefebvre’s history of
space, see Boer (2015), Grönlund (1993), and Shields (2005).
2. In a large body of literature, there are readings of several
Lefebvrean notions, particularly that of abstract and contradictory spaces, that interpret the notion of abstract space as a space
proper to capitalism including its advanced stage. At the same
time, those works consider contradictory space as contradictions
inherent to abstract space, that is, according to those interpretations, the notion of abstract space incorporates contradictory
space per se (Fuchs, 2019; Leckie & Given, 2010; Stewart,
1995; J. Wilson, 2013). Interestingly, our survey has shown the
dominance of such readings and interpretations in Turkey-related
scholarship. It is worthwhile to note the existence of contextualizations of the notion of the contradictory space in apparently
non-capitalist contexts as well (Jackiewicz & Bolster, 2003).
3. The search was conducted in EBSCOhost, ProQuest
Dissertations & Theses Global, Google Scholar, and National
Thesis Database of the Turkish High Education Council databases. Thus, works that are not indexed by these databases
have remained out of the search scope. Thus, this aspect should
be considered as one of the limitations of the current survey.
4. In the first stage, by the application of the above-mentioned
search keywords, 5,953 results from EBSCOhost, 3,008 results
from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, and 6,833
results from Google Scholar were listed. Since the National
Thesis Database of the Turkish High Education Council does
not provide “search in full-text” option in its search platform,
for this case, more detailed keywords were applied, such as
Lefebvre, production of space, and abstract space, to search
in title, abstract, and keyword sections of the database. As a
result, 97 relevant dissertations were listed from this database. It is important to note that the search was conducted till
the end of 2016, thus the end of 2016 appears as upper time
scope of the survey. Furthermore, there is high possibility that
some new relevant works dating before 2016 were indexed by
those research databases after our search and were thus outside of our scope. For example, Google Scholar with its indexing algorithm continuously adds previously published papers
appearing in the web in its database. Thus, there is the possibility that some relevant works, although having pre-2016
publication dates, remained outside of the survey’s scope since
they were indexed after our search.
5. For example, in several works, such as The Urban Revolution
(Lefebvre, 2003) or Writings on Cities (Lefebvre, 1996),
Lefebvre elaborates various conceptualizations directly or
indirectly related to space, but those elaborations do not have
a consistent nature.
6. The final body of literature, which has been considered as relevant for the survey, consists of 19 results from EBSCOhost,
19 results from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, 83
results from Google Scholar, and 26 results from National
Thesis Database of Turkish High Education Council databases.
7. For the final lists of studies described and the detailed information of their topic, geographical and historical scope, and
which conceptualizations of Lefebvre they apply, see the

SAGE Open
Supplemental Appendix of this article.
8. In Turkey, within the context of popularization of Lefebvrean
theorizations and propositions on cities and space, it is also
worth noting the recent translations of Lefebvre’s some other
seminal writings, namely The Urban Revolution (2013), Right
to the City (2016), and Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time and
Everyday Life (2017) into Turkish.
9. Another dominant pattern of contextualization of spatial triad
is the detachment of representation of space, representational
space, and spatial practices from the triad itself. For example,
while an urban park is under elaboration, it is analyzed as
representational space, or while a monument is under elaboration, it is analyzed in terms of representation of space. But
other aspects of the park or the monument, such as spatial
practices, are not considered at all. These kinds of analyses
are the perfect examples of negligence of the proposal of
Lefebvre according to which the social space embodies these
three aspects, no matter which aspect is more dominant at a
particular case.
10. For a more comprehensive and fuller picture and the detailed
information on the topic, geographical and historical scope,
and which conceptualizations of Lefebvre these studies contextualize, see the Supplemental Appendix of this article.
