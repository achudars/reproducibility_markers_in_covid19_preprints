Abstract:
The present study aims at investigating the translator’s use of Newmark’s translation procedures
in the translation process of the Islamic book Islamic Guidance. It also aims at exploring the
most frequently employed translation procedures as well as the effectiveness of using
Newmark’s translation procedures in conveying the source text to the target text as naturally and
accurately as possible. To achieve these goals, the researcher applies a descriptive content
analysis method on 18 religious texts collected from Islamic Guidance with their English
translations. The findings of this study indicate that the translator utilized all Newmark’s
translation procedures except the translation label. The most frequently used procedure was the
descriptive equivalent procedure whereas the least frequently used procedure was the recognized
translation procedure. The results also show that the translation procedures are helpful
(especially the target-oriented ones) in conveying the meaning of the text from Arabic into
English.

Chapter One
1. 1 Introduction
Translation is an important discipline, because it helps to communicate and exchange
information with people from different countries and cultures. Dick and Schwerter (2012) state that
translation is necessary for cultures and languages to exchange information. It also bridges the gap

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!12
between people and cultures. Paulston et al. (2012) state that translation connects people from
different cultures, across borders. However, translators often face problems transferring texts
between two different languages. As observed by Baker and Salanha (2009), these problems are
presented either at the micro level (a text segment) or at the macro level (the text as a whole). At the
macro level, a translator needs to establish equivalence between the source text (ST) and the target
text (TT) as much as possible. According to Beaugrande (1994, p. 56), equivalence is “the
correspondence of effects: those of the original on the source language audience versus those of the
translation on the target language audience.” Newmark (1981) classified translation equivalence
into two types: (a) communicative and (b) semantic.
Communicative translation attempts to produce on its readers an effect as close as possible to that
obtained on the readers of the original. Semantic translation attempts to render, as closely as the
semantic and syntactic structures of the second language allow, the exact contextual meaning of the
original (p. 39).

The previous definitions indicate that communicative translation focuses on content,
message, and meaning of the ST whereas semantic translation emphasizes on producing the same
effect of the ST to the TR. According to Newmark (1981), communicative translation is effective
while semantic translation is informative. He adds communicative translation focuses on the target
reader (TR) in which the translation will be in "his own culture," whereas semantic translation
conveys the source language (SL) culture to the TR and renders "its connotations" to the TR (p. 39).
Furthermore, it can also be noticed from the previous definitions that communicative translation
produces a more natural translation to the target reader (TR) than semantic translation. According to
Newmark (1981), communicative translation tends to be "smoother, simpler, clearer, more direct,
more conventional" than semantic translation. He concludes that the “equivalent effect” is
maintained in both methods (p. 39).

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!13
On the other hand, translators encounter many problems at the micro level while translating
a religious text into the target language (TL) since it is the most difficult translation. According to
Al-Harahsheh (2013), religious translation is problematic because it uses sacred texts. Agliz (2015)
points out that syntactic structure, equivalence, and cultural differences are some of the problems
encountered when translating religious texts. Mahmoud (2015) presented other problems of
translating a religious text from Arabic into English. The first problem is that some target
equivalents do not convey the implied meaning of the SL term. For example, the English term
"ablution" does not have the same meaning as the Arabic term "wudu." The second problem
encountered when translating an Islamic text is the absence of a TL equivalence. For example, the
Arabic word "iddah" has no English equivalent. Nida (1964) concludes "Differences between
cultures may cause more severe complications for the translator than do differences in language
structure" (p. 130). Thus, many scholars have proposed different methods and procedures to solve
these problems.
One of these solutions is translation procedures at the micro level. Mahmoud (2015)
suggested various translation procedures to cope with Islamic religious items, which were proposed
by different scholars. The first seven procedures were suggested by Vladimir Ivir (1987): literal
translation, borrowing, definition, addition, omission, lexical creation, and substation (as cited by
Mahmoud, 2015). The second five procedures were proposed by Hervey and Higgins (1992):
calque, cultural borrowing, cultural transplantation, exoticism, and communicative translation (as
cited by Mahmoud, 2015). The final sixteen translation procedures were suggested by Newmark
(1988): transference, naturalization, cultural equivalent, functional equivalent, translation label,
recognized translation, descriptive equivalent, componential analysis, synonymy, throughtranslation, shifts or transpositions, modulation, compensation, paraphrase, reduction and
expansion, and notes (as cited by Mahmoud, 2015). These translation procedures help translators to

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!14
overcome many translation problems at the micro level. In addition, they facilitate the translation
process.
In the current study, the researcher applies Newmark’s model of translation procedures to
Muhammad Abul Quasem's English translation of Mohammad Al-Ghazali's book Islamic
Guidance. The researcher compares 18 of the Arabic original texts in the book with their English
translations to identify the translation procedures used by the translator and to determine whether
they helped the translator cope with the linguistic and cultural differences between the two
languages.
1. 2 Statement of the Problem
The translation of religious texts is different from other types of translation since it requires a
high level of accuracy and faithfulness. The translation of the religious texts is necessary in
spreading the correct Islamic teachings to non-Muslims who want to convert to Islam. The use of
translation procedures in translating religious texts is necessary to overcome the cultural and
linguistic gaps between Arabic and English and hence make the meaning comprehensible to the TR.
This study aims to investigate the translation procedures applied in Muhammad Abul Quasem's
English translation of Mohammad Al-Ghazali's Islamic Guidance.
1. 3 Significance of the Study
This study is significant since it provides readers with the different types of translation
procedures. Moreover, the results of the study are beneficial because they illustrate the effectiveness
of using translation procedures in translating religious texts. In addition, this study is useful for
translators who are interested in translating religious texts.
1. 4 Research Questions
1. What types of translation procedures are employed in the English translation of an Arabic
Islamic text according to Newmark’s model?

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!15
2. What are the most frequently used Newmark’s translation procedures in the English
translation of an Arabic Islamic text?
3. To what extent do these translation procedures help to convey the meaning from the ST to
the TT as naturally and accurately as possible?
1. 5 Objectives of the Study
The present study aims to achieve the following objectives:
1. To identify which of Newmark’s translation procedures are applied in the English translation of
18 Arabic Islamic texts.
2. To determine which of these procedures are employed most frequently.
1. 6 Limitations of the Study
This study is limited to the analysis of 18 Islamic texts from Mohammad Al-Ghazali's book
Islamic Guidance translated from Arabic into English. Moreover, the current research explores
Newmark's translation procedures that were applied in the English translation.
1. 7 Definition of Terms
Translation: translation is "rendering the meaning of a text into another language in the way
that the author intended the text" (Newmark, 1988, p. 5)
Translation procedures: translation procedures mean "the technical devices used to transfer
the meaning of a text in one language into a text in another language (Pinchuck, 1977, p. 188).
Islamic text: Islamic text means "some texts that describe about Islamic values and activities
that can make the students closer to Allah” (Syafri, 2015, p. 212).
1. 8 Organization of the Study
The present research is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to the
study. It presents the study problem, study objectives, study questions, and definition of terms. The

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!16
second chapter presents the literature review and information about previous studies. It reviews the
importance of using translation procedures in translation and Newmark’s typology of translation
procedures. The third chapter discusses the methodology of the study, the sample texts, the
instruments and procedures of data collection, and the reasons for choosing translation procedures
and Newmark’s model. The fourth chapter presents the analysis of the data and discussion and the
fifth chapter presents the conclusions and recommendations.

Literature Review
2. 1 Introduction
The review of literature in this chapter is divided into three parts. In first part, the
importance of using translation procedures in translation is presented. In second part,
Newmark’s typology of translation procedures is reviewed. In the last part, the previous
studies related to the application of Newmark’s procedures to different types of text is
presented.
2. 2 The Necessity of Using Newmark's Translation Procedures in Cultural Translation
Bahameed (2008) investigated the following cultural obstacles when translating
from Arabic into English and suggests some translation procedures to deal with them. The
first obstacle is cultural differences. For instance, polygamy is acceptable in the Arabic
culture, while in the English culture, it is not acceptable. Therefore, a translator has to use
the compensation procedure in order to clarify the picture in the TL. The second obstacle is
the absence of the cultural equivalent such as the word "‫"ﺳﺤﻮﺭر‬. In this case, the translator
can use the note procedure to explain the meaning to the TL. The third obstacle is when a
SL word has an emotive meaning. The fourth obstacle is culture-specific expressions. For
example, the proverb "‫ "ﺻﺎﺣﺐ ﺻﻨﻌﺘﻴﯿﻦ ﻛﺬﺍاﺏب‬can be translated literally to the TL or by
applying the functional equivalence procedure as in "a Jack of all trades is a master of
none."
In her article "Translating Culture: Problems, Strategies and Practical Realities,"
Fernández Guerra (2012) investigated the translation procedures used by students when
they translated 40 cultural terms from Spanish into English and vice versa. The results of
the study show that the students used many translation procedures and strategies to
translate these cultural terms such as compensation, modulation, description, and

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!18
transposition. Finally, Fernández Guerra emphasized that translators resort to applying
various translation procedures, strategies, or techniques to solve the problems of cultural
gaps.
Al-Saidi (2013) investigates intercultural translation problems between English and
Arabic by selecting sample sentences. The researcher assures that different cultures cause
serious problems and suggests that the translator must be aware of the different aspects of
culture (such as religion, tradition, history, and geography) in order to find the closest TL
equivalents. The research revealed that the compensation procedure is the most suitable
procedure in rendering some culture-bound terms.
Putranti (2015) states that the loss and gain of meaning pose a problem in
translation due to cultural differences (p. 168). Therefore, the translator has to use
translation procedures to cope. The use of synonymy is one of the most common
translation procedures used, and it is utilized when there is no corresponding equivalent in
the TL.
Rasul (2016) investigates journalistic texts to identify the translation problems and
constraints when translating from English into Kurdish. The results of the study reveal that
linguistic and cultural factors cause translation problems. As a result, translation procedures
and strategies are suggested to resolve translation problems. The linguistic factors consist
of three levels: syntactic, semantic, and lexical. The researcher suggests the most useful
translation procedures used to cope with these difficulties are transposition, modulation,
reduction, and expansion. On the other hand, cultural adaptation, transference, and literal
translation are the most helpful translation procedures to overcome translation constraints
at the cultural level.
2. 3 Newmark’s Typology of Translation Procedures

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!19
Many models of translation procedures have been proposed by different scholars to
investigate and examine the linguistic variations that a translator makes through the
translation process. Therefore, the present study applies Newmark’s model of translation
procedures, since it is a comprehensive model. Newmark (1988) introduces 16 translation
procedures: transference, naturalization, cultural equivalent, functional equivalent,
descriptive equivalent, synonymy, through-translation, shift or transposition, modulation,
recognized translation, compensation, componential analysis, reduction and expansion,
paraphrase, couplets, and notes.
2. 3. 1 Literal Translation
According to Newmark (1988), literal translation is a translation procedure in which
"the SL grammatical constructions are converted to their nearest TL equivalents but the
lexical words are again translated singly, out of context" (p.46). For example, the English
proverb "tell me who you go with and I'll tell you who you are" is translated literally into
Arabic as "‫( "ﻗﻞ ﻟﻲ ﻣﻦ ﺗﺬﻫﮬﮪھﺐ ﻣﻌﻪﮫ ﻭوﺳﺄﻗﻮﻝل ﻟﻚ ﻣﻦ ﺃأﻧﺖ‬Alhaj, 2015, p.22).
2. 3. 2 Transference
According to Newmark (1988), transference is "the process of transferring a SL
word to a TL text" (p. 8). For example, the word "‫ "ﺟﻬﮭﺎﺩد‬is translated as "Jihad". This
procedure is used when there is no TL equivalent.
2. 3. 3 Naturalization
Newmark (1988) defined naturalization as the adaptation of a SL term to the
pronunciation and to the word-forms of the TL. For instance, the word "philosophy" is
translated into Arabic as "‫"ﻓﻠﺴﻔﺔ‬.
2. 3. 4 Cultural Equivalent

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!20
Newmark (1988) stated that the cultural equivalent procedure is a near translation
of a SL cultural term into a TL cultural term. For instance, "Best regards" is translated into
its cultural equivalent in Arabic as "‫( "ﻭوﺍاﻟﺴﻼﻡم ﻋﻠﻴﯿﻜﻢ ﻭوﺭرﺣﻤﺔ ﷲ ﻭوﺑﺮﻛﺎﺗﻪﮫ‬Tanjour, 2011, p. 52). The
use of the culture equivalent procedure is limited since it is not accurate.

!
!
!
2. 3. 5 Functional Equivalent
According to Newmark (1988), the functional equivalent procedure "requires the
use of a culture-free word, sometimes with a new specific term" (p. 83). For example, the
word "dress" is translated into its functional equivalent in Arabic "‫( "ﺛﻮﺏب‬Tanjour, 2011, p.
134).
2. 3. 6 Descriptive Equivalent
According to Newark (1988), “Descriptive equivalent” means explaining the ST
expression in several words to the TL. Unlike functional equivalent, descriptive equivalent
focuses on describing the cultural expression. Descriptive equivalent and functional
equivalent are necessary elements in translation. For example, the word "‫ "ﻁطﺸﺖ‬is translated
into its descriptive equivalent in English "aluminum basin".
2. 3. 7 Synonymy
The term "synonymy" is used by Newmark (1988) to refer to an approximate TL
equivalent of a SL word when there is no precise equivalent in the TL. According to
Newmark (1988), this procedure is applied when there is no clear equivalent and when the
word is insignificant in the text. For example, the Arabic phrase "‫ "ﻓﺴﺎﺗﻴﯿﻦ ﺯزﺍاﻫﮬﮪھﻴﯿﺔ‬is translated
into English as "beautiful dresses".

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!21
2. 3. 8 Through Translation (Loan Translation)
According to Newmark (1988), through translation or loan translation is "the literal
translation of common collocations, names of organizations, the components of
compounds" (p. 84). For example, the compound "secondary school" is translated into
Arabic as "‫( "ﺍاﻟﻤﺪﺭرﺳﺔ ﺍاﻟﺜﺎﻧﻮﻳﯾﺔ‬2015, p. 26).
2. 3. 9 Shifts or Transpositions
According to Newmark (1988), translation shifts are grammatical changes from the
SL into the TL. He classifies them into four types. The first type is the change of grammar
due to the grammatical differences between the ST and the TT. For instance, the English
singular noun “information” is translated into plural in Arabic as “‫ﻣﻌﻠﻮﻣﺎﺕت‬.” The second
type of shift is to change the grammatical structure of the SL because of the lack of the SL
grammatical construction in the TL. The third type of shift is used when the literal
translation of ST is grammatically possible, but its sound is awkward in the TL. The fourth
type of shift is the replacement of a ST grammatical structure to a lexical structure in the
TL.
2. 3. 10 Modulation
According to Newmark (1988), modulation refers to a change of a message of the
ST in the TL text because of different viewpoints in the SL and TL. For example, the
English noun in the sentence "she lived with her step mother" is translated into a noun
equivalent in meaning "‫( "ﻋﺎﺷﺖ ﻣﻊ ﺯزﻭوﺟﺔ ﺍاﺑﻴﯿﻬﮭﺎ‬p. 26).
2. 3. 11 Recognized Translation
According to Newmark (1988), recognized translation is the use of an authorized
translation of an institutional word. For instance, the phrase "national bank" is translated
into Arabic as "‫"ﺍاﻟﺒﻨﻚ ﺍاﻷﻫﮬﮪھﻠﻲ‬.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!22
2. 3. 12 Translation Label:
According to Newmark (1988), translation label is "a provisional translation,
usually of a new institutional term" (p.90). For example, the term "Dar-ul-Islam" is
rendered into Arabic as "‫( "ﺩدﺍاﺭر ﺍاﻻﺳﻼﻡم‬Dweik and Khaleel, 2017, p. 168).
2. 3. 13 Compensation
Newmark (1988) states that compensation occurs "when loss of meaning, soundeffect, metaphor or pragmatic effect in one part of a sentence is compensated in another
part, or in a contiguous sentence" (p. 90). For instance, the formal Arabic sentence "‫ﺳﻌﺪﻧﺎ‬
‫ "ﺑﻠﻘﺎﺋﻜﻢ‬is translated into English as "We are happy to meet you, sir" (2015, p. 26). In this
instance, the word "sir" is added to convey the formality of the Arabic sentence.
2. 3. 14 Reduction and Expansion
Reduction and expansion are practiced intuitively in a number of cases. Expansion
means using more words in the TT to re-express the meaning of a SL word due to the lack
of a precise equivalent in the TL. On the other hand, reduction means omitting unimportant
elements of the ST.
2. 3. 15 Paraphrase
According to Newmark (1988), paraphrase is used to illustrate the meaning of a part of a
text: particularly when there are significant implications. For example, the idiom "All this was
water on the Mater's mill" is rendered into Arabic as "‫( "ﻛﺎﻥن ﻫﮬﮪھﺬﺍا ﻛﻠﻪﮫ ﻣﻔﻴﯿﺪﺍا ﻟﺨﻄﻂ ﺍاﻷﻡم‬Tanjour, 2011, p.
141).
2. 3. 16 Couplets
Newmark (1988) states that the couplets translation procedure occurs when a
translator uses two different procedures to solve a single problem. For instance, the word

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!23
“Google” is translated into Arabic as “‫ﻣﺘﺼﻔﺢ ﻗﻮﻗﻞ‬.” Two procedures are used in this
example: transcription and paraphrase procedures.
2. 3. 17 Notes
According to Newmark (1988),writing notes procedure means, "supplying
additional information in a translation" (p. 91). A translator may be required to apply this
procedure in order to add cultural, linguistic, or technical information to the text. Notes can
be added via three methods: within the text, at the bottom of a page, or at the end of a
chapter or book.
2. 4 The Application of Newmark’s Model of Translation Procedures on Different Types of
Texts
Several studies have investigated the application of translation procedures on the
translation of various types of texts from English to other group of languages and vice
versa.
Maasoum and Davtalab (2011) analyzed some examples chosen from Dubliners
that were translated by different translators from English to Persian. The study investigated
if the translators succeeded in translating the cultural specific terms by using Newmark’s
model. The results of the study showed that the translators applied the borrowing strategy
more often than other strategies and procedures to solve the problem of lexical gaps.
Ismawari (2013) investigated Newmark’s translation procedures applied in the
translation of the novel Eragon from English into Indonesian. The researcher followed a
descriptive qualitative method to conduct this research. The results of the study revealed
that the translator utilized seven procedures: naturalization, componential analysis,
addition, transference, cultural equivalent, couplets, and transposition. The researcher

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!24
noticed that the cultural equivalent procedure is the most frequently employed translation
procedure in the translation of the novel.
Puspani and Savitri (2014) investigated the translation procedures that are applied
in the poetic translation “My Name is Dirah the Witch” from Indonesian to English. The
researchers applied Newmark's model in their study. The findings of the study revealed that
various types of translation procedures were used in conveying the cultural aspects of the
poem. These procedures are descriptive equivalent, expansion, modulation, functional
equivalent, and couplets.
In a dissertation submitted for the degree of strata one under the title “An Analysis
of Translation Procedure from English into Indonesian Language in the Novel The
Negotiator,” Pramono (2014) investigated Newmark’s translation procedures in the
translation of the novel The Negotiator from English into Indonesian. For the purpose of
the research, the researcher analyzed 11 translations based on Newmark’s model and other
models. The result of the study revealed that the translator used six translation procedures:
transference, cultural equivalent, naturalization, adaptation, modulation, and transposition.
Putri (2014) applied a quantitative method to investigate Newmark’s translation
procedures of medical terms. The medical terms were taken from a book entitled Stress
Less translated by Wandaningsih from English into Indonesian. The results of the study
revealed that 11 translation procedures were utilized in translating the medical terms:
"literal translation, transference, naturalization, descriptive equivalent, through-translation,
shift, modulation, recognized translation, reduction and expansion, note, and triplets" (p.
13).
Mashhady, Pourgalavi, and Fatollahi (2015) compared two Persian translations of
Golding's Lord of the Flies to assess the more appropriate translation and to determine the

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!25
most frequent procedure applied. The findings of this study showed that the two translators
(Mansoori and Rafiee) applied similar translation procedures. However, Rafiee’s
translation is more acceptable than Mansoori’s translation since Mansoori’s translation
omitted some important elements. Therefore, Mansoori’s translation cannot be regarded as
a complete translation. The study results also showed that Newmark’s model of translation
procedures is comprehensive and useful in assessing a literary translation.
Amininadji (2016) analyzed a Persian literary play Aroosak-ha and its English
translation Marionettes ; the aim of the research was to investigate whether Newmark’s
procedures are suitable in the translation and to identify the most frequently used
procedures by translators. The results of the study showed that Newmark’s procedures are
helpful in obtaining equivalence in translation. The translation procedures explored in this
study are divided into two categories. The first category is Newmark’s procedures for
translating culture-specific terms whereas the second one is general translation procedures.
Among the cultural-specific procedures, cultural equivalent, functional equivalent, and
literal translation are the most employed procedures. On the other hand, literal translation
and descriptive equivalent are the most frequently utilized procedures among general
translation procedures.
Behzadi and Suzani (2016) conducted a study to compare and analyze the English
translation of 30 eschatological terms, which have connotative meanings in the Holy Quran
by three translators. The purpose of the study was to see how these three translators
translated the terms using Newmark’s procedures. It also aimed at determining which
translation procedures are used more frequent. The findings of the study revealed that the
translators used only five procedures in translating the 30 eschatological terms: through
translation, cultural equivalent, paraphrase, transference, and synonyms. Moreover, the

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!26
results of the analysis revealed that through (loan) translation was the most frequently used
procedure.
Daghoughi and Hashemian (2016) investigated Newmark’s procedures to determine
the most useful procedure in translating culture-specific items applied in the English
translation of Jalal Al-Ahmad’s By the Pen. The results of the study revealed that the
functional equivalent was the most frequent translation procedure applied while translating
a literary text from Persian into English and that modulation and paraphrase were the least
frequent translation procedures applied.
From all these previous studies, the researcher can conclude that translation
procedures refer to the linguistic variations that a translator has to make during the
translation process from the SL to the TL. These linguistic changes are due to the cultural
and linguistic gaps between the SL and the TL. Therefore, many models of translation
procedures have been proposed to overcome these gaps. In this study, the researcher
applies only Newmark’s model of translation procedures to illustrate the translation
procedures to solve the linguistic and cultural gaps between Arabic (SL) and English (TL).

3. 1 Introduction
This chapter describes the methodology of the study, the sample texts, the data collection
instruments, and the procedures used. It also explains the data analysis used to analyze the collected
data of the study.
This study adopts Peter Newmark's proposed procedures for translation as its theoretical
framework. It applies a descriptive content-analysis methodology, which aims at analyzing the

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!27
translation of 18 texts from Mohammad Al-Ghazali's book Islamic Guidance (‫)بداية الهداية‬. The
study explores the translation procedures used in the TT and the efficiency of these procedures in
transferring the meaning of the ST into the TT. Moreover, descriptive analysis is used to investigate
the suitability of Newmark’s model of translation procedures that describes the procedures used
when translating between Arabic and English.
3. 2 Data Collection Procedure

!

This section consists of three parts. The first part describes the sample texts of the study. It

provides some information about the Arabic texts and their English equivalents. The second part
describes how the data for the study was collected and the tools used in collecting it. The last part
lists the reasons for choosing the particular sample texts.
3. 2. 1 Sample Texts of the Study
The sample texts are the source texts that are written in Arabic. They are selected from
Mohammad Al-Ghazali's Islamic Guidance, and their English translations. This book consists of
three chapters, and the examples are excerpted from different chapters of the book. Table 1 lists
characteristics of the sample texts.

The sentences and words in the sample texts were counted both manually and by using
Microsoft Word’s word count function. As shown in Table 1, the Arabic text (ST) consists of 214
sentences and 2298 words whereas the English text (TT) consists of 331 sentences and 5165 words.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!28
The SL information was translated by using an increased number of words in the TT due to the
cultural and linguistic differences between Arabic (SL) and English (TL).
3. 2. 2 Data Collection: Procedures and Instruments

!

The instruments of the data collection are sets of written texts which are representative of

three chapters of the Islamic book. Islamic Guidance is an informative guide to Islamic religious
knowledge that deals with various topics. The researcher selected six topics extracted from each
chapter as representative of the whole book. The number of words used to convey these topics is
different to gain a meaningful idea. If the number of words were the same, the meaning of them
would be incomplete. In this study, the researcher analyzed 18 Arabic texts and their English
translations to gather some details about the number of words and sentences. A comparative
analysis is conducted to investigate the applied translation procedures in the TT and to identify the
most frequently applied type of procedures. In the analysis, the researcher finds answers to the other
questions of the study concerning whether translation procedures help the translator transfer the
meaning of the ST to the TT or not and to see the suitability of using Newmark’s procedure to
transfer the linguistic and cultural meanings from the ST to the TT.

!
3. 2. 3 Reasons for Choosing Sample Texts and Newmark’s Model
!

The selected texts of the present study are taken from Mohammad Al-Ghazali's Islamic

Guidance (‫)ﺑﺪﺍاﻳﯾﺔ ﺍاﻟﻬﮭﺪﺍاﻳﯾﺔ‬. They are represented in 18 Arabic texts and 18 corresponding English ones to
investigate Newmark’s translation procedures in an Islamic text. The criterion of choosing the
sample texts depends on the main objective of the study of being an Islamic text. The whole book
deals with various Islamic topics. Moreover, the book contains Islamic terms.
Regarding the reasons for choosing Newmark’s theory of translation procedures, the
researcher attempts to identify the linguistic and cultural differences between the ST (Arabic) and
the TT (English) concerning the list in Newmark’s model. Moreover, the researcher aims to

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!29
investigate whether Newmark’s model is appropriate in describing the procedures that used by the
translator to solve the cultural and linguistic differences in translating an Islamic text from Arabic
into English.
3. 3 Data Analysis: Steps and Procedures
To analyze the selected texts, the researcher applied a comparative content-analysis between
the ST and the TT. This analysis is based on Newmark’s model of translation procedures. The 17
translation procedures are investigated.
The process of data analysis involves some phases that describe the applied methods and
procedures by the researcher to analyze the collected data of the study. The first phase in the data
analysis process is coding. Coding involves subdividing the selected texts and their English
equivalents into smaller units. In this research, the coding step is applied to find the similarities and
differences between the ST (Arabic) and the TT (English). The collected texts and their
corresponding English ones are divided into smaller units to facilitate the analysis process.
Table 1 provides basic structural information about the ST and the TT. The second phase in
the data analysis process involves other methods that are followed to complete the data analysis and
answer the research questions. After subdividing the Islamic texts and their English translations, the
researcher compared them to identify the translation procedures that the translator utilized. Then the
researcher counted the procedures to find out the most frequent one. After that, the researcher
investigated the effectiveness of the procedures in transferring the meaning of the ST naturally and
accurately. Finally, the researcher showed the impact of using Newmark's translation procedures in
conveying the linguistic and cultural meanings from Arabic into English.

Chapter Four
Data Analysis and Discussion
4. 1 Introduction
This chapter shows the findings of the study. The chapter also presents the analysis of 18 texts
taken from Al Ghazali’s book Islamic Guidance. Moreover, the questions which the study raises
concerning the types of translation procedures that are applied in the translation of Islamic texts and
the most frequently applied procedures are answered in the analysis. Furthermore, the analysis
process explores the usefulness of translation procedures in transferring meaning from the SL to the

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!31
TL and the suitability of Newmark’s model in describing the procedures that the translator applied
during the translation process.
4. 2 Research Question 1: What procedures are employed in the translation of an Islamic
text from Arabic to English according to Newmark’s model?
There are many differences between Arabic and English since they have different linguistic
systems. Therefore, translators have to apply translation procedures and strategies in the translation
process to overcome the linguistic differences between the two languages. In this section, the
researcher analyzes the Arabic text and its English translation. The rest of this section contains
examples of each type of translation procedure used in the book.
4. 2. 1 Literal Translation
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ‫ ﻭوﺍاﻟﻴﯿﻘﻈﺔ ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﺒﻌﺚ‬،٬‫ﺍاﻋﻠﻢ ﺃأﻥن ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﻤﻮﺕت‬
TT: Know that sleep is like a death and waking up like Resurrection
In this example, the Arabic sentence " ‫ ﻭوﺍاﻟﻴﯿﻘﻈﺔ ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﺒﻌﺚ‬،٬‫ "ﺍاﻋﻠﻢ ﺃأﻥن ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﻤﻮﺕت‬is translated into
English as “Know that sleep is like a death and waking up like Resurrection”. Here, as it is
observed, the translator applied a literal translation. The translator also arranged the English
sentence in the same word-order of the Arabic sentence. The translation is effective since it is
meaningful and respects the rules of English grammar. However, this procedure is not commonly
used between Arabic and English since they are different languages. According to Hadithya (2014),
literal translation is "most commonly found in translation between closely related languages" (p. 5).
Page 80: Text 10
ST: ‫ﻭوﺇإﺫذﺍا ﻟﻌﻨﺖ ﺃأﺣﺪﺍا ﻣﻦ ﺧﻠﻖ ﷲ ﺗﻌﺎﻟﻰ ﻁطﻮﻟﺒﺖ ﺑﻪﮫ‬
TT: If you have cursed any creature of God (Exalted is He!), you will be asked to give an
account of it.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!32
In this example, the Arabic clause "‫ "ﻭوﺇإﺫذﺍا ﻟﻌﻨﺖ ﺃأﺣﺪﺍا ﻣﻦ ﺧﻠﻖ ﷲ‬is rendered as "If you have cursed
any creature of God." The translator employed a literal translation procedure to render the Arabic
clause. The translation is accurate because the meaning is rendered and the syntactic and stylistic
characteristics are respected.
Page 77: Text 8
ST: ‫ﺍاﻟﻐﻴﯿﺒﺔ ﺃأﺷﺪ ﻣﻦ ﺛﻼﺛﻴﯿﻦ ﺯزﻧﻴﯿﺔ ﻓﻲ ﺍاﻻﺳﻼﻡم‬
TT: Backbiting is more serious than thirty adulteries according to Islam
In this example, the Arabic sentence "‫ " ﺍاﻟﻐﻴﯿﺒﺔ ﺃأﺷﺪ ﻣﻦ ﺛﻼﺛﻴﯿﻦ ﺯزﻧﻴﯿﺔ ﻓﻲ ﺍاﻻﺳﻼﻡم‬is translated literally into
English as "Backbiting is more serious than thirty adulteries according to Islam." The translator
replaced the Arabic words with their English equivalents in the same word-order and according to
the same structure of the Arabic sentence. By doing so, the translator maintained the meaning and
purpose of the Arabic sentence. According to Newmark (1988), literal translation is "normally
effective only for brief simple neutral sentences" (p. 69).
4. 2. 2 Transference
Page 70: Text 6
ST: ‫ﻓﻜﻴﯿﻒ ﺇإﺫذﺍا ُﻣﻠِﻰ َء ﻣﻦ ﺣﺮﺍاﻡم؟‬
TT: What, then, if the food which fills it is that the eating of which is forbidden (haram)?
In this example, the noun “‫”ﺣﺮﺍاﻡم‬means “the prohibition of a person from doing
something” (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer is wondering how hateful eating
prohibited food is to God. The translator translated the meaning by using its cultural equivalent
“forbidden” as well as transference “haram.” Using two procedures together (couplet) instead of
just one helped render the sense of the Arabic word “‫ ”ﺣﺮﺍاﻡم‬to the TR and elaborate its meaning.
Page 80: Text 11
ST: ‫ﺍاﻟﺤﺠﺎﺝج‬
‫ﻭوﻁطﻮﻝل ﺑﻌﺾ ﺍاﻟﻨﺎﺱس ﻟﺴﺎﻧﻪﮫ ﻋﻠﻰ‬
ّ

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!33
TT: Once a certain man said much against al-Hajjaj.
Footnote: Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi (d. 95 A.H.) was one of the most famous Umayyad
governors. The method which made him famous was indeed notorious - extreme severity, atrocities,
and bloodshed more than was necessary. He shed blood even in the holy city of Mecca and
bombarded the Holy Ka'ba and the pilgrims there.
In this context, the writer says that Allah will take vengeance from the people whose tongues
attack al-Hajjaj. The translator transferred the Arabic name “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﺤﺠﺎﺝج‬into “al-Hajjaj” in English.
However, al-Hajjaj’s name is not well known to the target reader (TR). Therefore, the translator
added a footnote to overcome the cultural gap. By doing so, the translator delivered the meaning of
the SL name accurately and effectively.
Page 70: Text 6
ST: ‫ﺛﻢ ﺍاﺟﺘﻬﮭﺪ ﺃأﻥن ﺗﻔﻄﺮ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻁطﻌﺎﻡم ﺣﻼﻝل‬
TT: Try to break your fast with that food the eating of which is lawful (halal) in Islam
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺣﻼﻝل‬is rendered “lawful (halal) in Islam” in English. The
translator applied two procedures here: cultural equivalent and transference. The translator also
added the prepositional phrase “in Islam” to clarify the meaning to the TR. According to Newmark
(1988), the translator should apply a second procedure with transference when the TL reader is not
familiar with the SL cultural term (p. 8). Hence, in this case, the translator rendered the meaning
successfully.
4. 2. 3 Naturalization
Page 63: Text 4
ST: ‫ﻭوﻻ ﻳﯾﻜﺒﺮ ﻣﺎ ﻟﻢ ﻳﯾﻔﺮﻍغ ﺍاﻟﻤﺆﺫذﻥن ﻣﻦ ﺍاﻹﻗﺎﻣﺔ‬

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!34
TT: The Imam should not say Allahu akbar (God is the greatest)until the man who calls
to ritual prayer (mu adhdhin) has completed the call to the actual start of the ritual prayer
(iqama).
In the above example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺇإﻗﺎﻣﺔ‬is "the second call to prayer offered
immediately before the ritual begins" (Bennett, 2013, p. 344). In this context, the writer gives an
instruction to Muslims, which is to not start a prayer until the Imam completes the iqama. However,
the TL equivalent of the word “iqama” does not exist in the target culture. Therefore, the translator
paraphrased the term “iqama.” In addition, the translator applied naturalization to adapt “‫ ”ﺇإﻗﺎﻣﺔ‬to an
English word. Hence, by using these two procedures, the translator rendered the meaning
comprehensively to the TR.
Page 63: Text 4
ST: ‫ﻭوﻳﯾﺠﻬﮭﺮ ﺑﺎﻟﻔﺎﺗﺤﺔ ﻭوﺍاﻟﺴﻮﺭرﺓة ﻓﻲ ﺟﻤﻴﯿﻊ ﺍاﻟﺼﺒﺢ‬
TT: He, however, should loudly read the Fatiha (i.e. The Opening Sura of the Qur’an)
and another sura {or part of another sura} in all two rakas of the Dawn Prayer.
Footnote: Sura 1 consisting of seven short verses.
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻔﺎﺗﺤﺔ‬refers to the name of a sura in the Qur'an. The
translator applied the naturalization procedure by transferring the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻔﺎﺗﺤﺔ‬into English
as “the Fatiha” which conforms to English pronunciation and morphology. In addition, the
translator applied a description equivalent "the opening sura of the Qur’an" and also a footnote
"Sura 1 consisting of seven short verses" to make the meaning clearer to the TR. Consequently, the
translator conveyed the meaning effectively.
Page 35: Text 2
ST: ‫ﻓﺈﺫذﺍا ﻓﺮﻏﺖ ﻣﻦ ﻁطﻬﮭﺎﺭرﺗﻚ ﻓﺼﻞ ﻓﻲ ﺑﻴﯿﺘﻚ ﺭرﻛﻌﺘﻲ ﺍاﻟﺼﺒﺢ ﺇإﻥن ﻛﺎﻥن ﺍاﻟﻔﺠﺮ ﻗﺪ ﻁطﻠﻊ‬

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!35
TT: When you have completed your cleanliness, perform in your house the two sunna
rak'as of the Dawn Prayer (Salat al-Fajr) if the dawn has already broken.
In this example, the dual noun “‫ ”ﺭرﻛﻌﺘﻲ‬is translated as “the two sunna rak’as” in English. The
translator transferred the letters “‫ ”ﺭرﻛﻊ‬and shifted the dual letters “‫ ”ﺗﻲ‬from grammar to lexis by
adding the number “two” and the plural form “s” to make the word compatible with English
pronunciation and morphology. In addition, the translator added the word “sunna” to inform the TR
that this prayer is not obligatory. Thus, the translator delivered the meaning of the text successfully.
4. 2. 3 Cultural Equivalence
Page 79: Text 9
ST: ً‫ﻓﺎﻋﻠﻢ ﺃأﻧﻬﮭﻢ ﺃأﻳﯾﻀﺎ ﻓﻲ ﺣﺎﻝل ﺗﺰﻛﻴﯿﺘﻚ ﻟﻨﻔﺴﻚ ﻳﯾﺬﻣﻮﻧﻚ ﻓﻲ ﻗﻠﻮﺑﻬﮭﻢ ﻧﺎﺟﺰﺍا‬
TT: Know that, when you glorify yourself, they also blame you in their minds while you
are present.
In this example, the translator rendered the Arabic plural noun “‫ ”ﻗﻠﻮﺑﻬﮭﻢ‬into “minds” in
English. The translator applied cultural equivalence by replacing the word “‫ ”ﻗﻠﺒﻚ‬with “mind,”
which made the meaning more comprehensible to the TR. As a result, the translation conveys the
intended meaning effectively.
Page 76: Text 7
ST: ‫ﻓﺈﻳﯾﺎﻙك ﺃأﻥن ﺗﺨﻠﻒ ﺇإﻻ ﻟﻌﺠﺰ ﺃأﻭو ﺿﺮﻭوﺭرﺓة؛ ﻓﺈﻥن ﺫذﻟﻚ ﻣﻦ ﺍاﻣﺎﺭرﺍاﺕت ﺍاﻟﻨﻔﺎﻕق‬
TT: take care not to break it, except when you are unable to fulfil it or from compulsion,
because breaking a promise is one of the signs of hypocrisy (nifaq).
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﻧﻔﺎﻕق‬means concealing disbelief inwardly and pretending to
be a believer of Allah outwardly (Almaany Dictionary). The translator applied its cultural
equivalent “hypocrisy” as well as transference “nifaq.” Using two procedures together helped
render the meaning of the Arabic term “‫ ”ﻧﻔﺎﻕق‬to the TR.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!36
Page 70: Text 6
ST: ‫ﻭوﺍاﻷﺫذﻥن ﻋﻦ ﺍاﻻﺳﺘﻤﺎﻉع ﺇإﻟﻰ ﻣﺎ ﺣﺮﻣﻪﮫ ﷲ‬
TT: the ear from listening to that which God has forbidden.
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺣﺮﺍاﻡم‬means “not allowed” (Almaany Dictionary). In this
context, the writer says that, when a Muslim fasts, he must restrain his ear from listening to what
Allah has prohibited. The translator used a cultural equivalent (“forbidden”) to achieve the purpose
of the sentence. Therefore, the intended meaning of the ST is maintained.
4. 2. 4 Functional Equivalence
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ،٬‫ﻓﺎﺑﺴﻂ ﻓﺮﺍاﺷﻚ ﻣﺴﺘﻘﺒﻞ ﺍاﻟﻘﺒﻠﺔ‬
TT: lay out your bed pointing to the direction of the Ka’ba
In this example, the translator translated the word “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻘﺒﻠﺔ‬as “the direction of the Ka’ba” since
there is no TL equivalent. The translator used the word’s functional equivalent “the direction of
Ka’ba,” to deliver the meaning effectively. However, to ensure understanding, the translator should
have added a footnote to explain the meaning of the cultural term “Ka’ba.”
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ‫ﻓﺮﻛﻌﺘﺎﻥن ﻓﻲ ﺟﻮﻑف ﺍاﻟﻠﻴﯿﻞ ﻛﻨﺰ ﻣﻦ ﻛﻨﻮﺯز ﺍاﻟﺒﺮ‬

TT: Two supererogatory rak 'as in the middle of the night is one of the treasures of the
righteous man.
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﺒﺮ‬is rendered as “ the righteous man.” The term “‫”ﺍاﻟﺒﺮ‬
means “obedience to Allah” (Almaany Dictionary). The translator explained the meaning of “‫”ﺍاﻟﺒﺮ‬
by applying its functional equivalent in the TL: “righteous man.” Therefore, the translator rendered
the sense of the term “‫ ”ﻟﺒﺮ‬successfully in spite of the lack of a culturally specific term in the TL.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!37
Page 100: Text 16
ST: ‫ﻭوﻳﯾﺨﻔﺾ ﻟﻬﮭﻤﺎ ﺟﻨﺎﺡح ﺍاﻟﺬﻝل‬
TT: to be humbly tender with them
According to Ibn Abba’s interpretation, “‫ ”ﻳﯾﺨﻔﺾ ﻟﻬﮭﻤﺎ ﺟﻨﺎﺡح ﺍاﻟﺬﻝل‬means to "humble yourself to
them" (2017).The translator neutralized the SL sentence by applying its functional equivalent “be
humbly tender with them” to overcome this cultural gap, which successfully rendered the meaning
of the ST.
4. 2. 5 Descriptive Equivalence
Page 65: Text 5
ST: .‫ﻭوﻳﯾﻘﺎﻝل ﺇإﻥن ﺍاﻟﻨﺎﺱس ﻓﻲ ﻗﺮﺑﻬﮭﻢ ﻋﻨﺪ ﺍاﻟﻨﻈﺮ ﺇإﻟﻰ ﻭوﺟﻪﮫ ﷲ ﺗﻌﺎﻟﻰ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻗﺪﺭر ﺑﻜﻮﺭرﻫﮬﮪھﻢ ﺇإﻟﻰ ﺍاﻟﺠﻤﻌﺔ‬

TT: It is said that men’s nearness to God at the time of looking upon the glorious face of
God (exalted is He!)( in Paradise) will be commensurate to their earliness of going to the
mosque for the Friday Assembly Prayer.
In this instance, the term “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﺠﻤﻌﺔ‬was translated as “Friday assembly prayer” in English. The
translator used its descriptive equivalent “Friday assembly prayer” to convey the meaning of the SL
term to the TR since the literal translation “Friday” does not convey the full intended meaning.
Consequently, the sense of the SL term was rendered successfully.
Page 80: Text 10
ST: ‫ﻓﺈﻥن ﺍاﻟﻤﻄﻠﻊ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺍاﻟﺴﺮﺍاﺋﺮ ﻫﮬﮪھﻮ ﷲ ﺗﻌﺎﻟﻰ‬
TT: for the One Who is aware of the secret beliefs of the mind is God (exalted is He)
In this instance, the plural noun “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﺴﺮﺍاﺋﺮ‬was translated as “secret beliefs of the mind” in
English. The translator described the meaning of the word “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﺴﺮﺍاﺋﺮ‬to provide its implied meaning
to the TR. Therefore, the translator succeeded in delivering the meaning of the SL term.

ST: ‫ﺑﻞ ﻳﯾﻨﺒﻐﻲ ﺃأﻥن ﺗﺤﻔﻆ ﺍاﻟﻌﻴﯿﻦ ﻋﻦ ﺍاﻟﻨﻈﺮ ﺇإﻟﻰ ﺍاﻟﻤﻜﺎﺭرﻩه‬

TT: You should guard the eye from looking at disliked things
In this example, the plural noun “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻤﻜﺎﺭرﻩه‬means"what a person hates and cannot bear or
endure” (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer says that, when a Muslim is fasting, he
should not look at things that Allah hates. The translator explained “‫ ”ﻣﻜﺎﺭرﻩه‬by employing the
descriptive equivalent “disliked things,” which provides the meaning. Thus, the meaning was
delivered successfully.
4. 2. 7 Synonymy
Page 99: Text 14
ST: ‫ﻭوﺍاﻟﺮﻓﻖ ﺑﺎﻟﻤﺘﻌﻠﻢ‬
TT: kindness towards students
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﻣﺘﻌﻠﻢ‬was rendered as “students” in English. The translator
employed two translation procedures: synonymy and transposition. The TL equivalent of the word
“‫ ”ﻣﺘﻌﻠﻢ‬is “learner.” However, the translator chose the synonymy “student” and he also replaced the
singular noun with the plural noun “students.” Despite making these changes to the text, the
translator delivered the meaning effectively.
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ‫ﻭوﻧﻢ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻳﯾﻤﻴﯿﻨﻚ ﻛﻤﺎ ﻳﯾﻀﻄﺠﻊ ﺍاﻟﻤﻴﯿﺖ ﻓﻲ ﻟﺤﺪﻩه‬.
TT: and sleep on your right side, the side on which the corpse reclines in the grave.
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﻟﺤﺪ‬means “the crevice that is beside the grave in which a
dead man is placed on his right side” (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer advises
Muslims to sleep on their right side as the dead person reclines in “lahd.” The translator used its

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!39
near synonym “grave” since there is no TL equivalent. However, “grave” gives a different meaning
to the text. Therefore, the translator failed to deliver the intended meaning to the TR. A better
procedure would have been using transference and inserting a footnote to explain the meaning of
“lahd.”
Page 79: Text 9
ST: ‫ﻓﺎﻧﻈﺮ ﺇإﻟﻰ ﺃأﻗﺮﺍاﻧﻚ ﺇإﺫذﺍا ﺃأﺛﻨﻮﺍا ﻋﻠﻰ ﺃأﻧﻔﺴﻬﮭﻢ ﺑﺎﻟﻔﻀﻞ ﻭوﺍاﻟﺠﺎﻩه ﻭوﺍاﻟﻤﺎﻝل ﻛﻴﯿﻒ ﻳﯾﺴﺘﻨﻜﺮﻩه ﻗﻠﺒﻚ ﻋﻠﻴﯿﻬﮭﻢ‬
TT: consider your reaction to those who are equal to you in age and merit when they
praise themselves for their excellence, influence and wealth- your mind refuses to
acknowledge what they claim
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﻣﺎﻝل‬means “anything a person or a group of people owns
such as property, cash, resources, assets, or animals” (Almaany Dictionary). According to the
context, the writer talks about the people who praise themselves for having a lot of money. The
translator used its synonym “wealth,” which conveyed the meaning and purpose of the sentence
accurately.
4. 2. 8 Through-Translation
Page 35: Text 2
ST: ‫ﻓﺄﻱي ﻓﺎﺋﺪﺓة ﻟﻚ ﻓﻲ ﻁطﻠﺐ ﺍاﻟﻌﻠﻢ؟‬
TT: what benefit will you have in seeking knowledge?
In this example, the Arabic collocation “‫ ”ﻁطﻠﺐ ﺍاﻟﻌﻠﻢ‬is rendered “seeking knowledge” in
English. In this context, the writer says that, if you do not pray in congregation (which is 20 times
better than praying alone), there is no benefit from your knowledge because the fruit of knowledge
is action. The translator applied the procedure of through-translation to translate the Arabic
collocation “‫”ﻁطﻠﺐ ﺍاﻟﻌﻠﻢ‬, which conveyed the intended meaning of the ST.
Page 80: Text 10

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!40
ST: ‫ﻭوﻟﻢ ﺗﺸﻐﻞ ﻟﺴﺎﻧﻚ ﺑﺬﻛﺮﻩه‬
TT: and never employed your tongue in mentioning him
In this example, the Arabic collocation “‫ ”ﺗﺸﻐﻞ ﻟﺴﺎﻧﻚ‬means “to keep your tongue
busy” (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer says that Muslims who have never
employed their tongues cursing Iblis will not be judged in the Day of Judgment. The translator
translated the Arabic collocation “‫ ”ﺗﺸﻐﻞ ﻟﺴﺎﻧﻚ‬literally to “employed your tongue”, which provided
the meaning to the TR. As a result, the translator maintained the purpose of the sentence and made
the translation sound more natural to the TR.
Page 99: Text 14
ST: ‫ﻭوﺻﺪ ﺍاﻟﻤﺘﻌﻠﻢ ﻋﻦ ﺃأﻥن ﻳﯾﺸﻐﻞ ﻧﻔﺴﻪﮫ ﺑﻔﺮﺽض ﺍاﻟﻜﻔﺎﻳﯾﺔ ﻗﺒﻞ ﺍاﻟﻔﺮﺍاﻍغ ﻣﻦ ﻓﺮﺽض ﺍاﻟﻌﻴﯿﻦ‬
TT: to keep the student from occupying himself with 'collective obligation'before
completing the “individual obligation",
Footnote: “Collective obligation” is an obligation upon all members of the society. If,
however, it is fulfilled by a single member, it is no longer the responsibility of all others. If it is
fulfilled by no one, all members of the society become sinners. The opposite of “collective
obligation” is “individual obligation” (fard al-'ayan) which is an obligation that must be fulfilled by
every member of the society.
In this example, the Arabic collocations “‫ ”ﻓﺮﺽض ﻛﻔﺎﻳﯾﺔ‬and “‫ ”ﻓﺮﺽض ﻋﻴﯿﻦ‬are rendered “collective
obligation” and “individual obligation,” respectively. In this context, the writer gives a rule to
teachers, which is to prevent a student from occupying himself with “collective obligation” before
completing “individual obligation.” The translator applied through-translation to translate the
Arabic collocations. In addition, the translator used a footnote to make the sentence comprehensible
to the TR.

4. 2. 9 Shifts or Transpositions
Page 99: Text 14
ST: ‫ﻭوﺗﺮﻙك ﺍاﻟﺘﻜﺒﺮ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺟﻤﻴﯿﻊ ﺍاﻟﻌﺒﺎﺩد‬

TT: not to take pride at the expense of anyone
In this instance, there is a transposition from lexis to grammar. The Arabic lexis noun in the
ST “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻌﺒﺎﺩد‬was translated into the indefinite pronoun “anyone” in English. This transposition is
optional because “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻌﺒﺎﺩد‬has an English equivalent (all servants). However, this shift did not change
the meaning of the ST.
Page 65: Text 5
ST: .‫ﺎﺟﺔ ﺇإﻻ ﺃأﻋﻄﺎﻩهُ ﺇإِﻳﯾﺎﻫﮬﮪھﺎ‬
َ ‫ﻭوﻓﻴﯿﻪﮫ ﺳﺎﻋﺔ ﻣﺒﻬﮭﻤﺔ ﻻ ﻳﯾﻮﺍاﻓﻘﻬﮭﺎ ﻋﺒﺪ ٌﻣﺴﻠﻢ ﻳﯾﺴﺎﻝل ﷲ ﺗﻌﺎﻟﻰ ﻓﻴﯿﻬﮭﺎ َﺣ‬
TT: On Friday there is an hour the exact time of which is unknown; if any Muslim by
happens to pray to God (exalted is He) for anything then most certainly God grants his
prayer.
In this instance, there is a transposition from grammar to lexis. The Arabic pronoun “‫ ”ﺇإﻳﯾﺎ‬and
the grammatical item “‫”ﻫﮬﮪھﺎ‬were translated into the noun “admonition” in English. It is necessary to
indicate what the pronoun “‫ ”ﺇإﻳﯾﺎﻫﮬﮪھﺎ‬refers to, because if the pronoun “‫ ”ﺇإﻳﯾﺎﻫﮬﮪھﺎ‬was replaced by the
pronoun “it”, it would cause some ambiguity to the TR because “‫ ”ﺍاﻳﯾﺎﻫﮬﮪھﺎ‬does not refer to the previous
word.
Page 70: Text 6
ST: .‫ ﻭوﻫﮬﮪھﻢ ﻓﻲ ﺃأﻋﻠﻰ ﻋﻠﻴﯿﻴﯿﻦ‬،٬‫ ﻛﻤﺎ ﺗﻨﻈﺮ ﺇإﻟﻰ ﺍاﻟﻜﻮﺍاﻛﺐ ﺍاﻟﺪﺭرﻳﯾﺔ‬،٬‫ﻓﺘﺘﺤﺴﺮ ﺇإﺫذ ﻧﻈﺮﺕت ﺇإﻟﻰ ﻣﻨﺎﺯزﻝل ﺍاﻟﺼﺎﺋﻤﻴﯿﻦ‬
TT: so that you will have regret when you will look at those who fast and see them in the
very highest grades, as if you were looking at a very bright star far above you.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!42
In this instance, there is a transposition from plural to singular. The plural noun “‫ ”ﻛﻮﺍاﻛﺐ‬is
replaced by the singular noun “star.” This shift or transposition is acceptable because it does not
change the meaning of the ST.
4. 2. 10 Modulation
Page 25: Text 1
ST: ‫ﺃأﺻﺒﺤﻨﺎ ﻭوﺃأﺻﺒﺢ ﺍاﻟﻤﻠﻚ ﷲ‬
TT: We and the rest of creation belong to God in this morning.
In this example, the abstract noun “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻤﻠﻚ‬in“‫ ”ﺃأﺻﺒﺤﻨﺎ ﻭوﺃأﺻﺒﺢ ﺍاﻟﻤﻠﻚ ﷲ‬was shifted to the concrete
noun “creation” in English. The translator used modulation to provide an effective equivalent for
the TR. As a result, the translator succeeded in rendering the pragmatic meaning of the ST to the
TR.
Page 25: Text 1
ST:

‫ ﺍاﻟﺤﻤﺪ • ﺍاﻟﺬﻱي ﺃأﺣﻴﯿﺎﻧﺎ ﺑﻌﺪﻣﺎ ﺃأﻣﺎﺗﻨﺎ ﻭوﺇإﻟﻴﯿﻪﮫ ﺍاﻟﻨﺸﻮﺭر‬:‫ﻓﻘﻞ ﻋﻨﺪ ﺫذﻟﻚ‬

TT: So at the time of waking, supplicate: Praise be to God Who has made us alive after
making us (i.e. our sensations dead in sleep, and towards Whom is the return after death).
In this instance, the Arabic verb “‫ ”ﻗُﻞ‬means “say” in English. However, the translator
rendered it into English as “supplicate,” which is a more specific verb. According to the context, the
author mentioned a supplication to Muslims to say it after waking up. Therefore, the translator
succeeded in achieving the functional equivalence of the Arabic verb “‫”ﻗُﻞ‬.
Page 99: Text 15
ST: ‫ﻭوﺃأﻥن ﻳﯾﻘﻠﻞ ﺑﻴﯿﻦ ﻳﯾﺪﻳﯾﻪﮫ ﺍاﻟﻜﻼﻡم‬
TT: to speak little in his presence

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!43
In this instance, the Arabic prepositional phrase “‫ ”ﺑﻴﯿﻦ ﻳﯾﺪﻳﯾﻪﮫ‬means in “front of him” (Almaany
Dictionary). This prepositional phrase was shifted to another part in the TT “in his presence.” The
use of the prepositional phrase “in his presence” is very common in English, whereas a literal
translation would produce an awkward translation. Therefore, the translator rendered the intended
meaning of the text effectively.
4. 2. 11 Recognized Translation
Page 99: Text 15
ST: ‫ﻋﻠﻴﯿﻬﮭﻤﺎ ﺍاﻟﺴﻼﻡم‬-‫ﻭوﻟﻴﯿﺬﻛﺮ ﻋﻨﺪ ﺫذﻟﻚ ﻗﻮﻝل ﻣﻮﺳﻰ ﻟﻠﺨﻀﺮ‬
TT: the student should recollect the complaint made by the prophet Moses to Khadir
(may peace be on them both!)
In this example, the writer advises students to avoid suspicion about teachers’ actions by
mentioning the story about Moses and Khadir. The Prophet’s name “‫ ”ﻣﻮﺳﻰ‬is rendered into its
globally recognized translation “Moses.” As such, the translator succeeded in delivering the
meaning to the TR.
4. 2. 12 Compensation

TT: The Imam will remain silent a little at the end of the Fatiha in order to recollect
himself.
In this example, the Arabic sentence "‫ ”ﻳﯾﺴﻜﺖ ﺍاﻹﻣﺎﻡم ﺳﻜﺘﺔ‬is translated as “the Imam will remain
silent a little” in English. The translator added the expression “remain silent a little” to convey the
Arabic repetitive emphatic form “‫ ”ﻳﯾﺴﻜﺖ ﺳﻜﺘﺔ‬to the TR. Consequently, the translation conveyed the
meaning successfully.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!44
Page 97: Text 13
ST: ‫ﻓﻠﻮ ﻋﺮﻓﺘﻪﮫ ﺣﻖ ﻣﻌﺮﻓﺘﻪﮫ ﻻﺗﺨﺬﺗﻪﮫ ﺻﺎﺣﺒﺎ ﻭوﺗﺮﻛﺖ ﺍاﻟﻨﺎﺱس ﺟﺎﻧﺒﺎ‬
TT: If you knew God truly and perfectly, you would take Him for a Companion and
leave people aside.
In this example, the Arabic expression "‫ ”ﻋﺮﻓﺘﻪﮫ ﺣﻖ ﻣﻌﺮﻓﺘﻪﮫ‬is translated as “ knew God truly
and perfectly” in English. The translator added the adverbs “truly and perfectly” to convey the
Arabic emphatic structure “‫”ﺣﻖ ﻣﻌﺮﻓﺘﻪﮫ‬. Therefore, the translator succeeded in rendering the intended
meaning to the TR.
4. 2. 13 Reduction and Expansion
Page 99: Text 15
ST: ،٬‫ ﻭوﺇإﺫذﺍا ﻗﺎﻡم ﻗﺎﻡم ﻟﻪﮫ‬،٬‫ ﻻ ﻳﯾﻜﺜﺮ ﻋﻠﻴﯿﻪﮫ ﺍاﻟﺴﺆﺍاﻝل ﻋﻨﺪ ﻣﻠﻠﻪﮫ‬:‫ﻓﺂﺩدﺍاﺏب ﺍاﻟﻤﺘﻌﻠﻢ ﻣﻊ ﺍاﻟﻌﺎﻟﻢ‬
TT: If you are a student you should observe the praiseworthy rules of a student's dealing
with a learned man. These rules are: not to speak to him much when he is tired, to stand up in
order to show respect for him when he stands.
In this example, the sentence is “‫ ”ﻭوﺇإﺫذﺍا ﻗﺎﻡم ﻗﺎﻡم ﻟﻪﮫ‬is translated “to stand up in order to show respect
for him when he stands” in English. The translator employed the expansion procedure by adding “in
order to show respect for him” in the TT to clarify to the TR the reason for standing when the
teacher stands. Consequently, this expansion made the sentence more comprehensible to the TR.
Page 104: Text 18
ST: ‫ﻭوﺍاﻟﺴﻜﻮﺕت ﻋﻠﻰ ﺗﺒﻠﻴﯿﻎ ﻣﺎ ﻳﯾﺴﻮﺋﻪﮫ ﻣﻦ ﻣﺬﻣﺔ ﺍاﻟﻨﺎﺱس ﺇإﻳﯾﺎﻩه‬
TT: Not to convey to him others' disdain for him; thereby making him unhappy.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!45
In this example, the sentence is “ ‫ ”ﻭوﺍاﻟﺴﻜﻮﺕت ﻋﻠﻰ ﺗﺒﻠﻴﯿﻎ ﻣﺎ ﻳﯾﺴﻮﺅؤﻩه ﻣﻦ ﻣﺬﻣﺔ ﺍاﻟﻨﺎﺱس ﺇإﻳﯾﺎﻩه‬is rendered as “ Not
to convey to him others' disdain for him thereby making him unhappy.” The translator applied
expansion by adding “making him unhappy” to inform the TR the effect of conveying people’s
distain to a friend. Hence, the purpose of the sentence is delivered accurately.
Page 99: Text 15
ST: ‫ﺃأﻥن ﻳﯾﺒﺪﺃأﻩه ﺑﺎﻟﺘﺤﻴﯿﺔ ﻭوﺍاﻟﺴﻼﻡم‬
TT: to greet the learned man first
In this example, the Arabic term “‫ ”ﺗﺤﻴﯿﺔ‬is a polite expression of recognition whereas the
Arabic term “‫ ”ﺳﻼﻡم‬means to say “’Alsalamu alikum’ when you meet a person” (Almaany
Dictionary). The translator omitted the term “‫ ”ﺳﻼﻡم‬from his translation. According to the context,
the writer prescribes a rule for students to deal with a learned man, which is to greet and salaam the
learned man. The translator omitted the term”‫ﺳﻼﻡم‬.” By doing this, the translator misses the intended
purpose of the writer. Therefore, the purpose of the sentence is not conveyed accurately. The TL
equivalent “salaam” would maintain the meaning and the purpose of the sentence.
Page 80: Text 12
ST: ‫ﺍاﻟﻤﺰﺍاﺡح ﻭوﺍاﻟﺴﺨﺮﻳﯾﺔ ﻭوﺍاﻻﺳﺘﻬﮭﺰﺍاء ﺑﺎﻟﻨﺎﺱس‬
TT: Jesting, Ridiculing and Mocking
In this example, the Arabic title “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻤﺰﺍاﺡح ﻭو ﺍاﻟﺴﺨﺮﻳﯾﺔ ﻭوﺍاﻻﺳﺘﻬﮭﺰﺍاء ﺑﺎﻟﻨﺎﺱس‬is translated as “Jesting,
Ridiculing and Mocking” in English. The translator omitted the word “people” from his translation
because titles in English are usually written in short form to attract readers' attention. This omission
does not affect the meaning, so the translation is effective.
4. 2. 14 Paraphrase

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!46
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ‫ ﻣﺴﺘﻐﻔﺮﺍا‬,‫ﻭوﺗﻨﺎﻡم ﺗﺎﺋﺒﺎ ﻣﻦ ﺍاﻟﺬﻧﻮﺏب‬
TT: Sleep after repenting of your sins, seeking forgiveness from God.
In this instance, the Arabic word “‫ ”ﻣﺴﺘﻐﻔﺮﺍا‬means “a person who ask Allah to forgive him or
her” (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer gives advice to Muslims which is to ask God
for forgiveness before going to sleep. However, there is a lack of a precise equivalent in the TL due
to cultural differences. Therefore, the translator used the paraphrase procedure to describe the same
meaning in different words. Hence, the translation conveys the meaning successfully.
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ‫ﻭوﺃأﻋﺪ ﻋﻨﺪ ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم ﺳﻮﺍاﻛﻚ ﻭوﻁطﻬﮭﻮﺭرﻙك‬
TT: As you go to bed, make ready your tooth-stick and the things which you will need,
after waking, for ablution or for washing the entire body if necessary.
In this example, the Arabic term “‫ ”ﻁطﻬﮭﻮﺭر‬means “cleanness from dirt” (Almaany Dictionary).
In this context, the writer gives advice to Muslims, which is to prepare what they need for cleanness
before going to sleep. The translator paraphrased the meaning of this word because some Muslims
might need to perform only ablution after sleeping while other Muslims might need to take a
shower. Therefore, the meaning of the word “‫ ”ﻁطﻬﮭﻮﺭرﻙك‬cannot be translated literally because the TL
reader might not understand the intended meaning of the Arabic word. Therefore, the translator
rendered the intended meaning successfully.
Page 65: Text 5
ST: ‫ﺍاﻋﻠﻢ ﺃأﻥن ﺍاﻟﺠﻤﻌﺔ ﻋﻴﯿﺪ ﺍاﻟﻤﺆﻣﻨﻴﯿﻦ‬
TT: Know that Friday is the festival of those who believe in God and in Muhammad as
His Messenger

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!47
In this instance, the Arabic word “‫ ”ﺍاﻟﻤﺆﻣﻨﻴﯿﻦ‬means “people who believe in God and the day of
judgment” (Almaany Dictionary). The English word “believers” in the TL does not convey the
whole meaning of the text, and this book is intended for Muslims who believe in God and in the
prophet Muhammad. Therefore, the translator applied the paraphrase procedure in order to convey
this important information to the TR. As a result, the translator delivered the meaning adequately.
4. 2. 15 Couplet
Page 54: Text 3
ST:

‫ﻓﺈﻥن ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم ﺗﻌﻄﻴﯿﻞ ﻟﺤﻴﯿﺎﺓة‬

TT: because sleep makes you without any work (which is bad).
In the above example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺣﻴﯿﺎﺓة‬means “the existence of a person, an animal, or
a plant” (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer says that sleeping too much hinders your
life. The translator rendered the intended meaning of “‫ ”ﺗﻌﻄﻴﯿﻞ ﻟﺤﻴﯿﺎﺓة‬by using its functional equivalent
“without any work,” which conveys the writer’s point of view. The translator also applied the note
procedure to make sure that the reader realizes that this habit is not good. Hence, the purpose of the
sentence was rendered successfully to the TR.
Page 80: Text 10
ST: ‫ﻭوﻻ ﺗﻘﻄﻊ ﺑﺸﻬﮭﺎﺩدﺗﻚ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺃأﺣﺪ ﻣﻦ ﺃأﻫﮬﮪھﻞ ﺍاﻟﻘﺒﻠﺔ ﺑﺸﺮﻙك ﺃأﻭو ﻛﻔﺮ ﺃأﻭو ﻧﻔﺎﻕق‬
TT: Do not accuse any of the people of qibla [i.e. Muslims] as a polytheist or infidel or
hypocrite,
In this example, “‫ ”ﻗﺒﻠﺔ‬is the Ka’ba, which is the direction that Muslims face in their
prayers (Almaany Dictionary). In this context, the writer gives the advice not to accuse any of the
people of qibla as being polytheists, infidels, or hypocrites. The translator maintained the name
“qibla” by using transference. In addition, the translator applied its functional equivalent “Muslims”

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!48
to avoid any confusion that the expression “people of qibla” may cause to the TR. Therefore, the
intended purpose of the writer, which is to avoid accusation to Muslims, was rendered correctly.
Page 25: Text 1
ST: ‫ ﻭوﻋﻠﻰ ﻛﻠﻤﺔ ﺍاﻹﺧﻼﺹص‬،٬‫ﺃأﺻﺒﺤﻨﺎ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻓﻄﺮﺓة ﺍاﻹﺳﻼﻡم‬
TT: In this morning we are at the state of natural disposition of Islam, on the Statement
of Sincerity (which is: 'There is no god but God' ).
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫ ”ﺇإﺧﻼﺹص‬in Islam means “doing good deeds to only become
closer from Allah not for praise” (Almaany Dictionary). The TL equivalent of the term “‫”ﺇإﺧﻼﺹص‬
conveys only one part of the meaning. Therefore, the translator added a note “there is no god but
God” in addition to its TL equivalent “sincerity” to explain the meaning of the SL term. As a result,
the purpose of the context was delivered adequately.
4. 3 Research Question 2: What are the most frequently employed procedures in the
translation of an Islamic text from Arabic to English according to Newmark’s model?
The researcher used a qualitative method to count the types of Newmark’s translation
procedures that were applied by the translator in the English translation of 18 texts chosen from Al
Ghazali's Islamic book. Table 2 provides the number of the applied procedures and their
frequencies.

According to the data in Table 2, paraphrase was the most frequently employed procedure in
the selected texts. It represented 16.1 % (32 items) of all the employed procedures. Descriptive
equivalent was the second most utilized procedure: representing 13.6 % (27 items). It was followed
by cultural equivalent (11.6 % or 23 items), transpositions (9.0 % or 18 items, couplets (7.0 % or 14
items), synonymy (7.0 % or 14 items), functional equivalent (5.5 % or 11 items), notes (5.0 % or 10
items), expansion (4.54 % or 9 items), literal translation (4.0 % or 8 items), through-translation (3.5

or 6 items), reduction (1.0 % or 2 items), compensation (1.0 % or 2 items), and finally, recognized
translation (0.5 % or 1 item).

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!50
4. 4 Research Question 3: To what extent do these translation procedures help to transfer
meaning from the ST to TT as naturally and accurately as possible?
Algliz (2015) pointed out that syntactic structure, equivalence, and cultural differences cause
problems when translating a religious text from Arabic into English. It can be observed from the
comparative analysis that the translator tried to fill the linguistic and cultural gaps between Arabic
and English. For that reason, the translator used many translation procedures: paraphrase, functional
equivalent, cultural equivalent, transference, naturalization, recognized translation, literal
translation, synonymy, modulation, reduction and expansion, compensation, through-translation,
descriptive equivalent, notes, shifts, and couplets. Some of these procedures are source-oriented
procedures, while the others are target-oriented procedures (i.e. some procedures focus on the
culture of the SL while the others focus on the culture of the TL). The analysis of the sample texts
of this study revealed that literal translation, through-translation, and transference are sourceoriented procedures, whereas compensation, descriptive equivalent, paraphrase, cultural equivalent,
functional equivalent, reduction, transposition, naturalization and modulation are target-oriented
procedures.
Many of the applied translation procedures were target-oriented procedures. A few procedures
were applied inappropriately and did not convey the meaning of the ST. The following shows an
instance in which the translation procedure does not convey the meaning of the ST.
Page 35: Text 2
ST: ً‫ ﻭوﻻ ﺳﻤﻌﺔ‬،٬‫ ﻭوﻻ ﺭرﻳﯾﺎ ًء‬،٬ً‫ﻓﺈﻧﻲ ﻟﻢ ﺃأﺧﺮﺝج ﺃأﺷﺮﺍاً ﻭوﻻ ﺑﻄﺮﺍا‬
TT: I swear to You that I set out neither lightheartedly nor bewildered, neither from
ostentation nor from a desire to be well spoken of

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!51
In this example, the Arabic noun “‫”ﺭرﻳﯾﺎء‬is a good deed done by a person with the goal of
earning praise from people rather than pleasing Allah (Almaany Dictionary). The translator applied
the cultural equivalent “ostentation” to translate this word. However, this term is not a precise
equivalent for the SC term, because it only conveys one part of the meaning. Other procedures that
should be applied are transference “Riya" and footnote to define this religious term.
On the other hand, some of the applied translation procedures were source-oriented
procedures to deliver the meaning of the Arabic text. The translator applied them to preserve the
stylistic ad syntactic features of the Arabic text. The following shows an instance in which the
translation procedure conveys the meaning of the ST
Page 54: Text 3
ST: ‫ ﻭوﺍاﻟﻴﯿﻘﻈﺔ ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﺒﻌﺚ‬،٬‫ﺍاﻋﻠﻢ ﺃأﻥن ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﻤﻮﺕت‬
TT: Know that sleep is like a death and waking up like Resurrection.
In this example, the Arabic clause "‫ ﻭوﺍاﻟﻴﯿﻘﻈﺔ ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﺒﻌﺚ‬،٬‫ "ﺍاﻋﻠﻢ ﺃأﻥن ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم ﻣﺜﻞ ﺍاﻟﻤﻮﺕت‬is rendered as “Know that
sleep is like a death and waking up like Resurrection.” The translator used a literal translation
procedure to render the Arabic sentence. The translation is accurate since it delivers the meaning of
the ST and respects rules of English grammar.
In conclusion, the findings of this study and other studies such as Guerra’s (2012) and
Putranti’s (2015) prove that translation procedures are useful to cope with cultural and linguistic
discrepancies between two different languages. However, a few of these translation procedures
were not accurately used by the translator. As a result, translation procedures help translators deliver
the meaning of the ST naturally and accurately to the TL, but it depends on the translator’s
competence.
4. 5 Summary

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!52
The current chapter presented the analysis of Islamic texts to answer the study questions. The
analysis of the study showed that all of Newmark's translation procedures were applied except for
the translation label. The analysis also showed that descriptive equivalent was the most frequently
applied procedure, whereas recognized translation was the least frequently applied procedure.

This chapter summarizes the findings of the study. It also provides some recommendations
regarding the application of translation procedures in translation between different language
systems.
5. 1 Conclusion of the Study
The translator applied 16 translation procedures out of 17 of Newmark’s translation
procedures in the translation of the book Islamic Guidance, namely descriptive equivalent, cultural
equivalent, transpositions, couplets, synonymy, functional equivalent, notes, expansion, literal
translation, through-translation, transference, modulation, naturalization, reduction, compensation,
and recognized translation. The paraphrase procedure was the most frequent applied procedure with
a frequency count of (16.1%). The descriptive equivalent was the second most frequently applied
translation procedure with a frequency count of (13.6). It was followed by cultural equivalent (with
23 cases equal to 11.6 %), transpositions (with 18 cases equal to 9.0%), couplets (with 14 cases
equal to 7.0% ), synonymy (with 14 cases equal to 7.0 % ), functional equivalent (with 11 cases
equal to 5.5% ), notes (with 10 cases equal to 5.0 %), expansion (with 9 cases equal to 4.54%),
literal translation (with 8 cases equal to 4.0 % ), through-translation (with 7 cases equal to 3.5%),
transference (with 7 cases equal to 3.5 % ), modulation (with 7 cases equal to 3.5%), naturalization
(with 6 cases equal to 3.0%), reduction (with 2 cases equal to 1.0 %), compensation (with 2 cases
equal to 1.0 %), and finally, recognized translation (with 1 case equal to 0.5 %).
The findings reveal that some of the procedures are source-oriented procedures such as
literal translation, through-translation, and transference. On the other hand, many of the translation
procedures are target-oriented procedures such as compensation, descriptive equivalent, paraphrase,

cultural equivalent, functional equivalent, reduction, transposition, naturalization, and modulation.
These translation procedures (particularly the target-oriented ones) were beneficial in helping the
translator transfer the meaning of the Arabic text to the English text accurately. However, the
translator applied a few procedures inappropriately. The last finding shows that Newmark’s model
of translation procedures was comprehensive and worked well to overcome the linguistic and
cultural gaps between Arabic and English.
These procedures also helped the translator render the religious terms accurately. Thus, they
worked well to fill the linguistic gaps between Arabic and English. In addition, Newmark’s
translation procedures helped the translator make the translation sound more natural to the TR. To
sum up, it can be observed from the analysis that Newmark’s translation procedures were effective
in translating the Islamic texts
Finally, it can be concluded that Newmark’s translation procedures are necessary in the
translation of an Islamic text between two different language systems and cultures. However, the
translator must be competent in using the translation procedures to provide an accurate translation.
5. 2 Recommendations for Further Studies
The researcher came up with a set of recommendations in the light of the findings reached
and the results obtained. The recommendations can make a helpful set of guidelines for both
existing and potential translators in general and for translating religious texts of two languages that
are not closely related. The recommendations and suggestions are tentative and are subject to
modification upon closer investigation by translation scholars and professionals:
1- The researcher recommends that the study of translation procedures should be included in
university curriculum for students who study translation, in order to help them solve the problems
of translating religious texts.

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!55
2- It is recommended for translators to use the translation procedures appropriately in order to
deliver the meaning of the ST accurately.
3- The researcher also recommends examining the application of other kinds of translation
procedures on Islamic texts based on other models such as Andrew Chesterman’s translation
procedures.
4- It would also be beneficial to investigate Newmark’s translation procedures to different kinds of
texts such as medical texts and journalistic texts.

of natural disposition of Islam, on the
Statement of Sincerity (which is: "There
is no god but God’, on the religion of our
prophet Muhammad (may God bless him
and greet him), and on the religion of our
father Abraham, a man of pure faith, a
man completely surrendered to God and
was not one of those who believe that
God has divine partners. God, we pray to
You that You would direct us today to all
good. I seek the protection of You from
committing any evil today and from
bringing any evil upon a Muslim. God,
through You alone we have come to this
morning, through You alone we passed
the night, through You alone we live,
through You alone we die, and to You
alone is our final return. We pray to You
for the good of today and of that which is
in it; we seek the protection of You from
the evil of today and of that which is in it.
When you put on your clothes after
waking from sleep), produce in your mind
the intention of fulfilling the commands
of God (exalted is Hel) to cover your
private parts. Beware of making your
purpose in wearing clothes to dissemble
before others; if this be your purpose you
will be the loser.

.‫ﺫذﻧﻮﺑﻲ؛ ﻓﺈﻧﻪﮫ ﻻ ﻳﯾﻐﻔﺮ ﺍاﻟﺬﻧﻮﺏب ﺇإﻻ ﺃأﻧﺖ‬
proceed towards the mosque. Do not omit
ritual prayer in congregation, especially
the Dawn Prayer. Ritual prayer in
congregation is twenty seven times better
than the ritual prayer one performs alone.
If you are easy-going concerning a
spiritual gain of this kind, what benefit
will you have in seeking knowledge?
Certainly the fruit of knowledge is action
in accordance with it. When you walk to
the mosque, walk easily and calmly, and
do not hurry. When walking along the
road to the mosque, supplicate: God, by
those who beseech You and by those who
long for You, and by this walk of mine to
You, I swear to You that I set out neither
lightheartedly nor bewildered, neither
from nor from desire to be well spoken of.
On the contrary, I have set out for fear of
Your anger and seeking Your pleasure. I
beg from You that You deliver me from
Hell and forgive my sins, for there is no
one who can forgive sins except You.
3- AL-GHAZAL ON ISLAMIC
GUIDANCE GOOD MANNER OF
SLEEPING

‫ ﺁآﺩدﺍاﺏب ﺍاﻟﻨﻮﻡم‬-3

APPLYING NEWMARK'S PROCEDURES ON THE TRANSLATION OF ISLAMIC TEXTS!65
(On completing the duties of the day and
night when a Muslim comes to sleep, he
should follow a few rules which are very
simple, easy and meaningful. Observance
of these rules will make his sleep fully
Islamic; disregard of them, however, is
not a sin. After sleeping in the Islamic
way, a Muslim should also follow Islamic
methods. Then as he starts doing his
duties of the day he must keep himself
within the bounds of Islam. Continuance
in this Islamic way of life, for the rest of
one's life, may naturally be felt hard and
burdensome, but al-Ghazali here suggests
certain methods which will facilitate this
continuance. When you intend to go to
sleep, lay out your bed pointing to the
direction of the Ka’ba in Mecca, and sleep
on your right side, the side on which the
corpse reclines in the grave. Know that
sleep is like a death and waking up like
Resurrection. Perhaps God (exalted is
Hel) will take your soul this night; so be
prepared to meet Him by being clean
through the performance of ablution when
you sleep. Have your will written and
beneath your head. Sleep after repenting
of your sins, seeking forgiveness from
God and resolving not to return to your
sins. Resolve to do good to all Muslims if
God (exalted is Hel) raises you up again.
Remember that in the like manner you
will lie in the grave, completely alone;
nothing except your action, will be with
you, and only the effort you have made
for action will be rewarded to you.
Do not try to induce too much of sleep
with effort, i.e. by spreading out a soft and
smooth bed, because sleep makes you
without any work (which is bad) , except
when to be awake is unwholesome for
you - in that case sleep preserves your
religious nature. Know that night and day
are twenty-four hours; the amount of
sleep you take altogether, by night and
day, should not be more than eight hours.
It is enough, supposing you live for sixty
years, that you lose twenty of these years

Messenger of God (may God bless him

Allahu akbar (God is the greatest) until
the man who calls to ritual prayer (mu
adhdhin) has completed the call to the
actual start of the ritual prayer (iqama),
and until the rows of the people are
straight. At every, Allahu akbar the Imam
will raise his voice, but his follower will
not raise his voice except to the extent
that he himself can hear it.
The Imam will make the intention (niyya)
of leading the ritual prayer so that he may
gain the reward of the act of leading. Even
if he does not make the intention the ritual
prayer of the congregation will be valid,
provided they make the intention of
following him, and they will obtain the
reward of ritual prayer in congregation.
Like a man performing a ritual prayer
alone, the Imam will secretly read the
supplication for starting the ritual prayer
and seek the protection of God against
Satan. He, however, should loudly read
(22) the Fatiha i.e. The Opening Sura of
the Qur’an and another sura {or part of
another sura} in all two rakas of the Dawn
Prayer and the first two rakas of the
Sunset Prayer and the Evening Prayer.
The same will be done by the man
performing ritual prayer alone. The Imam

Tradition that five things make a man
break his duty of fasting: lying,
backbiting, slandering, looking at
someone with lust, and the false oath. The
Prophet (may God bless him and greet
him!) said, "Fasting is certainly a
protection; if one of you is fasting let
him avoid loose talk, transgression of
divine command, and folly; if anyone
attacks him or rebukes him let
him says, "I am fasting." Try to break
your fast with that food the eating of
which is lawful (halal) in Islam, and do
not take an excessive amount, eating more
than you normally eat at night because
you are fasting by day. If you take the
whole amount you usually take, there is
no difference between eating it at one
meal at night and eating it at two meals
one by day and one by night, as when a
man is not fasting. The aim in fasting is to
annul your desire and to multiply your

unable to fulfill it or from compulsion,
because breaking a promise is one of the
signs of hypocrisy (nifaq) and an evil
character. Thus the Prophet (may peace he
upon him!) said,
"There are three things which, if they are
found in a man, mean that he is a
hypocrite (munafiq), even though he fasts
and performs ritual prayer. They are:
when he relates something, he lies; when
he makes a promise, he breaks it; and
when he is given a trust, he betrays it."

him, pray for him in secret. If you are
really grieved for his sake, the sign of it is
that you do not want to express his faults
and to disgrace him; but in expressing
your grief at his fault you manifestly
backbite him.
Restrain yourself from backbiting, the
statement of God (exalted is Hel) is
sufficient: "Do not backbite one another.
Would any of you like to eat the flesh of
his dead brother? Surely you would loath
such an act. God has likened you to one
who eats the flesh of a dead man. How
fitting that you should guard against
backbiting. There is one thing which, if
you reflect on it, will prevent you from
backbiting the Muslims. That is to
examine yourself to see whether you have
any outward or inward fault and whether
you are commit ting any sin secretly or
openly. When you have (done this and
known about the presence of any fault or
sin in you, then do understand that the

9. Self-glorification
Restrain the tongue from selfglorification. God (exalted is He!) said,
"Do not ascribe purity to yourselves; He
knows best him who is truly righteous.
Someone asked a wise man, "What is bad
truthfulness?’ He replied, "A man's praise
of himself." So beware of forming the
habit of doing that. Know that selfglorification reduces your honor in the
estimation of people and necessarily leads
to God's hatred of you. If you want to
know that your praise of yourself does not
cause an increase in your honor in the
estimation of others, consider your
reaction to those who are equal to you in
age and merit when they praise
themselves for their excellence, influence
and wealth- your mind refuses to
acknowledge what they claim, your nature
feels it burdensome, and you blame them
for it when you have left them. Know
that, when you glorify yourself, they also
blame you in their minds while you are
present, and, after you have left their
company, express their opinion in words.

so-and-so? Why were you silent about
him? Rather even if throughout your life
you have never cursed Iblis and never
employed your tongue in mentioning him,
you will not be asked concerning that on
the Day of Resurrection; but if you have
cursed any creature of God (exalted is
He!), you will be asked to give an account
of it. Never blame anything created by
God. Indeed,
the Prophet (may God bless him and greet
him!) would never criticize bad food;
rather if he wanted anything, he ate it;
otherwise he left it alone.
11- Invoking Evil towards Others
Guard your tongue against invoking evil
towards any creature of God (exalted is
Hel) even although he has oppressed you;
leave the matter of his oppressing you to
God (exalted is He!). It is mentioned in
Tradition "The oppressed prays for the
evil of the oppressor until he requites him.
Then the oppressor becomes his creditor,
and will make his demand on the Day of
Resurrection." Once a certain man said
much against al-Hajjaj. Is One of the
righteous ancestors who was present there
remarked: "Just as God will take
vengeance on al-Hajjaj for those whom he
oppressed, so He will certainly take
vengeance for al-Hajjaj on those whose
tongues attack him.'

people's minds. Do not associate with

reply to them but turn away from them
"until they engage in some other
discourse,’ and be one of "those who,
when they come upon anything vain, pass
on with dignity.' These sins are the evil
acts of the tongue. Nothing will assist you
against them except solitude for some
time and preservation of silence always
mod except when there is need to talk.
Indeed, the most devout Abu Bark (may
God be pleased with him!) used to place a
stone in his mouth to prevent himself
speaking without necessity; he used to
point to his tongue and say, "This is what
has brought all troubles upon me.' Guard
against the tongue, for it is the chief cause
of your destruction in this world and the
Hereafter.

God are: keeping silent with the head cast
down, ignoring one's surroundings,
concentration of care and attention on
God, continuance of silence, keeping the
body's members at rest, hastening to carry
out His commands and avoiding His
prohibitions, not complaining against fate,
continual remembrance of God and
reflection on Him, preference of the truth
over falsehood, independence from
people, humility before the awe of Him,
brokenness of mind under the sense of
shame, quiescence of mind from the
worries of earning a livelihood while
relying on the guarantee of sustenance
given by God, and trust in the bounty of
God knowing that He chooses for man
only that which is good for him.
All these should be your distinctive
characteristics in all your days and nights,
for they are the rules of companionship
with a Companion Who does not leave

14- ASSOCIATION WITH STUDENTS
If you are a learned man you should
observe the rules of a man of knowledge
which are seventeen in number: 1)
patience, (2) continual forbearance, (3)
sitting with awe in a dignified manner
with the head cast down, 4) not to take
pride at the expense of anyone except
oppressors as a deterrent to their
oppression, (5) preference for humility in
meetings and conferences, (6) not to jest
and joke, 17) kindness towards students,
(8) to act unhurriedly with the proud, (9)
correction of the dull by suitable guidance
without becoming enraged against them,
10 not to be too disdainful to confess
one's own ignorance of a problem, 11 to
give full attention to one who asks
questions and to try to understand them,
12 acceptance of arguments of others,
(13) to yield to the truth by turning
towards it from error, 14) to forbid the
student to acquire any such knowledge as
is harmful to him, (15) to prevent him
from intending to seek useful knowledge
for anything other than the pleasure of
God (exalted is He!), 16) to keep the
student from occupying himself with
'collective obligation' before completing
the “individual obligation, his 'individual
obligation' being the correction of his
outward (zahir) and inward (batin) self
with piety (taqwa) , and 17) the correction
of himself with piety first so that his
student may follow him first through his
actions and then derive benefit from his
words.

stands, not to follow him speaking and

to imagine evil of him in regard to those
of his actions which may appear
abominable. The teacher knows better
concerning his secret affairs.
When some actions of the teacher appear
abominable, the student should recollect
the complaint made by the prophet Moses
to Khadir (may peace be on them both!),
"Have you made a hole in the boat to
drown the people in it? You have, indeed,
done a strange thing!" ' In fact Moses was
wrong in his complaint which he made
relying upon the outward appearance of
what Khadir did .

If your parents are alive you should
observe the rules of the behavior of a
child with his parents. These rules are: to
listen to what the parents say, to stand up
in order to show respect to them when
they stand, to obey their orders, not to
walk before them, not to raise your voice
over their voices, to answer to their call,
earnestly to desire to please them, to be
humbly tender with them, not to remind
them of any good thing done for them or
of any undertaking of their affairs, not to
look at them askance, not to frown in their
faces, 199 and not to travel to a distant
place without their permission.
17- COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE
UNKNOWN COMMON MEN
Know that people, besides teachers,
students, and parents, are of three
categories for you. They are either your
friends, or those known to you but not
intimately, or they are unknown to you. If
you are involved with common men
whom you do not know, you should
observe the rules of sitting in company
with common men. The rules of
companionship with common men are:
avoidance of engagement in conversation
with them, to listen very little to the news
and rumors they spread, to feign
unconcern with the bad words they
habitually utter, to guard against meeting
them frequently and against being in need
of them, to warn them of their evil deeds
with compassion, and to admonish them
when there is hope that they may accept
the admonition.

The duties of friendship 207 are: 1. To
help the friend financially even when one
needs money for oneself. If this altruism
is not possible, one should help the friend
with one's surplus wealth at the time of
his need. One should also assist him in his
needs spontaneously, before he seeks
assistance. 2. To hide his secrets, and to
conceal his faults. 3. Not to convey to him
others' disdain for him thereby making
him unhappy. Rather to convey to him
others' praise of him, thereby pleasing
him. 4. To listen to him with full attention
when he speaks and not to argue with
him. To call him with that name which he
likes most, to praise him by mentioning
his deeds that one knows, and to express
gratitude to him in his presence for the
good deeds he has done. 6. To defend the
friend in his absence when aspersions are
cast on his good repute, as one defends
oneself.
To admonish him with kindness and in
ambiguous terms when he needs
admonition. 8. To forgive his faults and
errors and not to blame him. 9. In one's
solitude, to pray for the friend during his
lifetime and also after his death. 10. To
take care of a friend’s wife and his other
relatives after his death. 11. To choose to
make things easy for the friend; so one
will not charge him with the meeting of
any of one's needs. 12. To give rest to his
mind by removing causes of distress. 13.
To express joy at all his delights, and to
express sorrow at all unwanted things
which happen to him, and to keep in mind
that feeling for him which has been
expressed to him so that one become
truthful in one's friendship, both secretly
and openly. 14. To greet the friend first
when he approaches, to make room for
him, to come out from the house to
receive him, to see him off when he
leaves, to keep silent when he speaks until
he completes his conversation, and not to
interrupt him when speaking. In short, one
is to behave with one's friend just as one
