Left behind? Over-time change in the social mobility of children from
unskilled working-class backgrounds in Germany
ABSTRACT: Research on intergenerational social mobility tends to focus on examining the level of overall
social fluidity in society. However, from a social justice perspective it can be argued that the type of social
fluidity that matters most is upward mobility from the lowest rung of the social ladder. This article examines
the labour market chances of children from parents in unskilled working-class positions, relative to children
from skilled working-class and higher social class backgrounds, and how they have changed across four birth
cohorts in post-WWII Germany. We find that individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds have
substantially lower labour market chances than individuals from skilled working-class or higher social class
backgrounds. Moreover, we find that the gap in labour market chances between individuals from unskilled
working-class backgrounds and individuals from more advantaged backgrounds has not narrowed, but if
anything has widened across the four birth cohorts we examine. Our results suggest that an important factor
underlying this sustained labour market inequality is a persistently high level of educational inequality between
these groups.

Introduction
Existing research on intergenerational social mobility tends to focus on examining the level
of overall social fluidity in society. Consequently, we still know relatively little about the
social mobility of specific groups and how it has changed over time. This article focuses on
the over-time change in the labour market chances of children from unskilled working-class
backgrounds. Having been born into a family at the very bottom of the social class
spectrum, these individuals can be seen as having drawn the worst ticket in the ‘lottery of
birth’ (Rawls, 1971). It follows that, from a normative, social justice perspective, whether or
not they can improve their social position by being upwardly mobile is of greater concern
than is the social mobility of individuals coming from more advantaged social backgrounds.
Past research on over-time change in social fluidity in Germany finds a trend of
increasing social fluidity across cohorts born in the early and mid 20th century, i.e. a
weakening of the association between individuals’ social class position and that of their
parents, net of changes in the social class structure (Müller and Pollak, 2004; Breen and Luijk,
2007; Breen, 2010). However, there is some evidence that this trend of increasing social
fluidity has levelled out or even reversed for people born in the second half of the 20th
century (Mayer and Aisenbrey, 2007). In light of these broader trends, the first aim of this
article is to examine the over-time change in the labour market chances of individuals from
unskilled working-class backgrounds, relative to individuals from higher social class
backgrounds, across four cohorts born in 1940-49, 1950-59, 1960-69 and 1970-79.1 As
discussed in further detail in the next section of the paper, comparing individuals across
these four birth cohorts is of particular interest as they grew up and entered the labour
market under highly distinct economic circumstances. Given that the institutional context
and the dynamics of intergenerational transmission of inequality have been shown to differ
substantially between former East and West Germany (see, e.g., Betthäuser, 2019; Pollak
and Müller, 2004; Mayer and Solga, 1994), we focus our analysis on individuals born in West
Germany.
The second aim of this article is to examine the role of educational inequality in
accounting for the difference in the labour market chances of children from unskilled
working-class backgrounds and their more advantaged peers, and how it has changed over
time. As illustrated by the well-known ‘OED triangle’, the total effect of individuals’ social
origin on their social destination can be decomposed into two parts: one that is mediated by
children’s educational attainment and one not mediated by education—the so-called ‘direct’
effect of social origin (see, e.g., Goldthorpe, 2007:159; Bernardi and Ballarino, 2016,
Gugushvili et al., 2017). Past research suggests that in Germany a substantial proportion of

1

the total effect of parents’ social class background on their offspring’s labour market position
is mediated via individuals’ educational attainment (Müller and Pollak, 2004:107). However,
it has been argued that this mediating role of education is weaker for people from unskilled
working-class backgrounds (Ishida et al., 1995:177). We use a new decomposition method
developed by Karlson, Holm and Breen (2012) and a series of logistic regression models to
estimate the proportion of the effect of social origin on social destination that is mediated
by education and the extent to which the associations between the different components of
the OED triangle have changed over time.
This paper uses social class as an indicator of individuals’ position in society, as it is
known to be a key determinant of individuals’ economic security in industrial and postindustrial economies (Breen and Rottman, 1995; Marshall, 1997; Goldthorpe and Marshall,
1992; Wright, 2008; Crompton, 2008; Scott, 1996). As such, parents’ social class position is
a key determinant of the economic resources available to their children during their
educational trajectory and transition into the labour market (see, e.g., Shavit and Blossfeld,
1993; Bernardi and Ballarino, 2016; Pfeffer and Hällsten, 2012).2 Children of parents in
unskilled working-class positions are considered to be at a particular disadvantage, as in
Germany the working and living conditions between the unskilled and skilled working class
differ substantially. In the German ‘dual labour market’, people in skilled working-class
positions enjoy a relatively high level of economic security due to labour market institutions
such as collective wage bargaining, employment protection legislation and high
unemployment insurance benefits, while individuals in the unskilled working class generally
receive substantially less institutional support (see Betthäuser, 2017; Emmenegger et al, 2012;
Lindbeck and Snower, 1988; Leibfried and Tennstedt, 1985).
Why expect over-time change in social mobility?
Changes in educational inequality and economic inequality in society are generally thought
to be two important macro-level factors shaping the level of intergenerational social mobility
in society. This section discusses whether and how changes in these two domains may be
expected to have affected the labour market chances of individuals from unskilled workingclass backgrounds, relative to individuals from higher social class backgrounds.
Attempts of explaining the trend of increasing overall social fluidity in Germany have
highlighted the role of a decline in educational inequality between individuals from different
social class origins and an increase in the share of people with high levels of educational
attainment, the latter being generally referred to as ‘educational expansion’. More specifically,
past research attests a decline in educational inequality in Germany over the course of the

2

20th century (see, e.g., Müller and Pollak, 2004), which—given the known role of education
in mediating the association between social origin and destination—is thought to have led
to an increase in social fluidity (Breen, 2010). Moreover, based on the observation that the
origin-destination association tends to be weaker for people with higher levels of educational
attainment in Germany and other western societies (Breen, 2010; Breen and Jonsson, 2007,
Hout, 1988), it has been argued that the educational expansion in Germany also contributed
to an increase in overall social fluidity (Breen, 2010; Breen et al., 2009, 2010).
If the trends of educational equalization and expansion were to have had an effect
on the inequality in labour market chances between individuals from unskilled working-class
backgrounds and individuals from higher social class backgrounds, we would expect to find
a gradual increase in the relative labour market chances of individuals from unskilled
working-class backgrounds across the four cohorts we consider. However, while these
trends may account for the observed increase in overall social fluidity during the 20th century,
it is not clear that they also led to an increase in the mobility chances of individuals from
unskilled working-class backgrounds. With the notable exception of an extension of
compulsory schooling in all German states (Bundesländer) during the two decades following
World War II (see Betthäuser, 2018; Müller and Haun, 1994), there have been few reforms
of the German education system which can be expected to have substantially reduced the
educational inequality between this group and people from more advantaged backgrounds
(see, Bukodi et al., 2017, Neugebauer et al., 2013; Schneider, 2006). Moreover, given the
generally low level of educational attainment of people from disadvantaged backgrounds
(Shavit and Blossfeld, 1993), it is questionable whether the trend of educational expansion
in Germany has increased the educational attainment of this group to an extent that would
have given rise to a weakening of the effect of their parental class background on their labour
market chances. It thus remains an empirical question to what degree there has been a
decline in the educational inequality at the bottom of the social class structure and whether
educational expansion has led to an increase in the relative labour market chances of people
from unskilled working-class backgrounds.
Aside from the dynamics of educational equalization and expansion, the level of
economic inequality in society is generally thought to be an important macro-level factor
affecting the level of social fluidity in society (Corak, 2013; Andrews and Leigh, 2009). It has
been argued that the level of economic resources that parents can use to support their
children’s education and transition into the labour market is a key determinant of the latter’s
educational attainment and labour market position (Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992).
Consequently, a high level of inequality in economic resources in the parental generation is
seen to lead to a high level of inequality in the educational and labour market chances of

3

children from different social backgrounds (Corak, 2013; Andrews and Leigh, 2009, but see
Bukodi et al., 2017), and vice versa. Changes in the level of parental economic resources are
likely to have a particularly strong effect at the bottom of the social class structure, where
parents have to make hard choices about the amount of economic resources that they can
devote to supporting their children’s early development, education and labour market entry.
The level of economic security of people in unskilled working-class positions relative
to people in higher social class positions has varied considerably across the four birth cohorts
we examine. Following the post-war economic depression, the rapid economic growth and
the expansion of the welfare state during the Wirtschaftswunder of the 1950s and 60s led to
full employment, rising living conditions and social security, which is likely to have benefitted
particularly people at the bottom of the income distribution (see Kaelble, 2007: 187-8;
Atkinson, 2008:230). By contrast, the relative economic security of this group can be
expected to have declined during the period following the 1970s Oil Crisis, which saw a
substantial increase in unemployment, economic inequality, relative poverty and a
retrenchment of unemployment benefits for people with low unemployment insurance
contribution records (Leibfried et al., 1995; BMAS, 2001; OECD, 2011; Ostheim and
Schmidt, 2007; Eichhorst and Marx, 2011; Emmenegger et al, 2012).
If these historic developments were to have had a bearing on the relative labour
market chances of people from unskilled working-class backgrounds, we would expect the
post-war depression to have had a negative effect on the relative labour market chances of
this group in the 1940s cohort, while individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds
in the 1950s cohort and to some extent in the 1960s cohort may be expected to have
benefitted from the shared prosperity of the Wirtschaftswunder (see Table 1). The relative
labour market chances of people from unskilled working-class backgrounds in the 1970s
cohort may be expected to have been negatively affected by the Oil Crisis and the welfare
state retrenchment that began in the early 1970s. It should be noted that we do not aim to
establish the causal effects of these macro-level trends, but rather use them to guide our
empirical analysis and to interpret our findings in relation to the historical context of postWWII Germany.

Data and variables
We use the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) as the primary dataset for our
analyses (see Wagner et al., 2007). In order to avoid any potential bias due to survey

4

specificities, we verify the robustness of our results by running all our models on a secondary
dataset, the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS/GGSS) (see Wasmer et al., 2014).
Both the SOEP and the ALLBUS provide detailed information on the social class position
and education of respondents and their parents, and the two datasets have been widely used
for the analysis of intergenerational social mobility in Germany (see, e.g., Pollak, 2000; Pollak
and Müller, 2004; Hertel, 2017). All results reported in the main body of the text are based
on the SOEP data. The results from our replication analyses based on the ALLBUS data are
given in the Appendix. While most previous research on educational and labour market
inequalities in Germany uses the ‘complete case analysis’ approach and thus relies on the
assumption that missingness in the data is completely at random (White et al., 2010), we
impute missing data points using multiple imputation by chained equations and thereby limit
the risk of potential bias related to systematic item missingness in our data.
Individuals’ and parents’ social class position is operationalised using the European
Socio-Economic Classification (ESeC), which was developed by Rose and Harrison (2010)
and has been validated for Germany and other European countries (Wirth et al., 2010). The
ESeC class schema is particularly well suited for our analysis as it allows for a clear
differentiation of the unskilled working class (ESeC 9) from the skilled working class (ESeC
7 and 8) and higher classes.3 Given that individuals’ social class position tends to stabilise
after age 34 (see, e.g., Bukodi and Goldthorpe, 2011), we reduce our sample to individuals
aged between 34 and 64 and control for respondents’ age in all our analyses.
Our analysis focuses on two binary dependent variables. The first indicates whether
individuals have attained a labour market position in the skilled working class or above. The
second indicates whether individuals have attained a position in the intermediate class or the
salariat. As discussed above, obtaining a position in the skilled working class in Germany
provides people with substantially more secure working and living conditions, compared to
being in the unskilled working class. In turn, gaining a position in the intermediate class or
the salariat can be expected to constitute a further significant increase in the level of
economic security, mainly due to the higher earnings of individuals in these class positions.
Using these two ‘labour market cut-offs’ as dependent variables allows us to examine both
the short- and long-range mobility chances of individuals from unskilled working-class
backgrounds.
Mirroring our dependent variable, parents’ class position is measured using a threecategory version of the ESeC schema, differentiating between (1) the unskilled working class,
(2) the skilled working class, and (3) the intermediate class and salariat. We derive parents’
class position from fathers’ and mothers’ class positions using the dominance approach,
which allocates parents to a social class position according to the higher social class position

5

of the two spouses (see Erikson, 1984). The parental class position is measured at age fifteen
of the cohort members, i.e. when they were at the end of their lower-secondary education.
Cohort members’ educational attainment is measured using a four-category variable
distinguishing between individuals whose highest educational qualification is (1) a midsecondary qualification (Realschulabschluss), lower secondary qualification (Hauptschulabschluss)
or less, (2) an upper secondary qualification (Abitur or Berufsausbildung), (3) a post-secondary
qualification (Meister or equivalent), or (4) a tertiary qualification (Universitätsabschluss or
Fachhochschulabschluss). We measure individuals’ educational attainment at the age at which we
observe their social class position. We control for individuals’ gender in all our analyses and
have conducted separate robustness checks which lead us to the same conclusions for both
women and men.
Table 2 shows the distribution of our focal variables across the four birth cohorts
we examine. In the parental generation, there has been an expansion of the intermediate
class and salariat across the four cohorts, which is mirrored by a contraction of the skilled
working class, while the share of people in the unskilled working class has remained relatively
stable. By contrast, the social class structure remained stable across the four cohorts in the
respondents’ generation. This is in line with previous findings on the development of the
German social class structure (see, e.g., Müller and Pollak, 2015). As expected, we observe a
trend of educational expansion across our four birth cohorts.

Results 1: Over-time change in social mobility
As noted above, our first aim is to provide a descriptive account of labour market inequality
between people from unskilled working-class backgrounds and people from more
advantaged backgrounds, and how this has changed over time. To this end, we apply two
binary logit models for each of our two dependent variables, i.e. attaining a position in the
skilled working class or above (Cut-off 1) and attaining a position in the intermediate class
or above (Cut-off 2). We include our measure of parental class as the focal explanatory
variable, as well as an interaction between parental class and birth cohort.
— Figure 1 about here —
Based on these models, Figure 1 shows the predicted probabilities of individuals from
different social class backgrounds to attain a position above the two labour market cut-offs.

6

All odds ratios of the models are shown in Table A1 in the Appendix. As indicated by the
distance between the lines in Figure 1, we find a substantial difference in the labour market
chances of people from unskilled working-class backgrounds, people from skilled workingclass backgrounds and people from intermediate class and salariat backgrounds. The
probability of people from unskilled working-class backgrounds born in the 1940s to attain
a position in the skilled working class or above, i.e. to cross Cut-off 1, was about 75 percent,
while it was about 85 percent for people from skilled working-class positions and about 95
percent for people from intermediate class or salariat backgrounds. Similarly, the probability
of people from unskilled working-class backgrounds to attain a position in the intermediate
class or above, i.e. to cross Cut-off 2, was about 48 percent, while it was about 60 percent
for people from skilled working-class backgrounds and about 82 percent for people from
intermediate class or salariat backgrounds. In short, the difference in the labour market
chances of individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and people from more
advantaged backgrounds was about ten percentage points or higher in the 1940s birth
cohort.
With regards to over-time change across the first two birth cohorts—i.e. the 1940s
and the 1950s cohorts—Figure 1 suggests that there may have been an increase in the labour
market chances of individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds, relative to
individuals from skilled working-class and higher social class backgrounds. However, this
over-time change is not statistically significant (see Table A1, M2). With regards to the
second labour market cut-off, we find a statistically significant general increase in the absolute
likelihood of all individuals to obtain a position in the intermediate class or above between
the 1940s and 1950s cohorts (see Figure 1 and Table A1, M3). This reflects an increase in
the proportion of jobs in higher social classes at the time of the German Wirtschaftswunder.
Yet, this shift in the social class structure appears to have benefitted people from unskilled
working-class backgrounds and people from higher social class backgrounds to similar
extents, thus leaving the relative labour market chances between them unchanged. In sum,
we do not find evidence for the expectation that the expansion of the welfare state and the
rise in economic prosperity during the Wirtschaftswunder increased the relative labour market
chances of people from unskilled working-class backgrounds.
With respect to over-time change across the last three birth cohorts—i.e. the 1950s,
1960s and 1970s cohorts—we also find no evidence for a decline in the labour market
inequality between people from unskilled working-class backgrounds and people from
higher social class backgrounds. Instead, Figure 1 suggests that, if anything, there may have
been a modest widening of the gap in labour market chances between these groups across
the three birth cohorts. This trend is statistically significant at the second labour market cut-

7

off for the contrast between individuals from unskilled and skilled working-class
backgrounds (Table A1, M2 and M4).4 This suggests that the levelling-off of the trend of
increasing social mobility for individuals born in the second half of the 20th century that has
been demonstrated in the existing literature (see Mayer and Aisenbrey, 2007) may have been
driven by a decline in the mobility chances of individuals from unskilled working class
backgrounds.
Results 2: Education as a channel for the intergenerational transmission of
disadvantage
Our second research question focuses on the role of educational inequality in accounting for
the persistent inequality in the labour market chances of people from unskilled workingclass backgrounds and people from more advantaged backgrounds. More specifically, we
seek to assess to what extent educational attainment mediates the effect of growing up in an
unskilled working-class family on individuals’ own social class position and how this
mediating role has changed over-time
As noted above, we use the decomposition method developed by Karlson, Holm
and Breen (2012) to estimate the percentage of the total effect of parental class on
individuals’ labour market chances that is mediated via individuals’ educational attainment.5
Figure 2 shows this mediation percentage for each of our four birth cohorts, separately for
the two labour market cut-offs. By way of example, the first dot in Figure 2 indicates that
for people born in the 1940s about half of the effect of growing up in a skilled working-class
family as opposed to growing up in an unskilled working-class family (the reference category)
is mediated by individuals’ level of educational attainment. Importantly, this proportion
appears to be highly stable across the four birth cohorts and across both labour market cutoffs.6 In other words, in all four birth cohorts about half of the labour market disadvantage
of individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds can be explained by the fact that
they leave the educational system with lower educational qualifications than is the case for
individuals from higher social class backgrounds.7 Importantly, this finding contradicts past
research which claims that education does not play a prominent role in explaining the labour
market disadvantage experienced by children from unskilled working-class families (cf.
Ishida et al., 1995:177).8
— Figure 2 about here —
While Figure 2 suggests stability in the role of education in channelling the intergenerational
transmission of disadvantage in Germany, this stability may mask more subtle changes in

8

the associations within the abovementioned ‘OED triangle’, i.e. (1) the association between
individuals’ parental class background and their educational attainment, (2) the association
between individuals’ educational attainment and their social class position, and (3) the ‘direct’
association between individuals’ parental class background and their social class position,
not mediated by education. Given the expansion of the ‘knowledge economy’ that began in
Germany in the early 1970s (Wren, 2013; Seeleib-Kaiser et al., 2011), one could, for example,
expect a strengthening of the association between individuals’ educational attainment and
their social class position (cf. Bell, 1976), which may have compensated a possible weakening
in the association between parental class and educational attainment. Such countervailing
over-time changes may not be reflected in changes in the proportion of the parental class
effect that is mediated by education, which we estimated above.
— Table 3 about here —
In order to examine whether there have been any over-time changes in the associations that
comprise the OED triangle, we first focus on the association between individuals’ parental
class background and their educational attainment. To this end, we run two ordered logit
models with the four-category educational attainment variable described above as the
dependent variable, first including parental class as the main explanatory variable (Table 3,
M1) and then adding an interaction between parental class and birth cohort membership
(Table 3, M2).9 The interaction terms shown in M2 of Table 3 suggest a persistent gap in the
educational attainment between individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and
people from higher social class backgrounds across the four birth cohorts we examine. This
finding contrasts with the finding of a decline of educational inequality in Germany over the
course of the 20th century (see, e.g., Breen 2010), and suggests that this general trend does
not appear to have benefitted children from unskilled working-class backgrounds in the four
cohorts we examine.
— Table 4 about here —
The next step of our analysis examines, first, the association between individuals’
educational attainment and their labour market position, and second the direct effect of
peoples’ social class background on their labour market position, net of educational
attainment. We apply two sets of binary logit models for each of the two labour market cutoffs. In the first set of models we include individuals’ educational attainment and parental
class background as the focal explanatory variables (Table 4, M1 and M3). In the second set

9

of models we then add an interaction between educational attainment and birth cohort
membership, as well as an interaction between parental class background and birth cohort
membership (Table 4, M2 and M4).
As expected, the main effect of our measure of educational attainment shown in M1
and M3 indicates that individuals’ level of education exerts a strong influence on their
chances to attain a position above either of the two labour market cut-offs. However, the
interaction terms between educational attainment and birth cohort membership shown in
M2 and M4 suggests that there has been no systematic change in this association across the
four birth cohorts we examine. This finding contradicts the expectation that the ‘knowledge
economy’ has led to a strengthening of this association across the birth cohorts we examine
(cf. Bell, 1976).
With regards to the direct effect of individuals’ social class background on their
labour market position, net of educational attainment, the main effect of our measure of
parental class shown in M1 and M3 confirms our finding from the decomposition analysis
that parents’ class position affects individuals labour market position not only via their
educational attainment, but also ‘directly’, or rather through other mechanisms.10 However,
the interaction between parental class and birth cohort in M2 and M4 suggests little evidence
for any systematic change in this direct effect of peoples’ parental class background on their
labour market chances across the four birth cohorts we consider.11
Conclusion
While past research on intergenerational social mobility has focussed on measuring the level
of overall social fluidity in society, this paper examines the social mobility chances of the
specific group of individuals born into unskilled working-class families. From a normative,
social justice standpoint, we consider the mobility chances of individuals in this group to be
of particular importance, given their disadvantaged position at birth. The overarching aim
of this paper has been to demonstrate the importance of considering changes in the social
mobility of specific group of individuals—particularly those born into disadvantaged
conditions—as these may diverge from more general changes in social fluidity. To this end,
we have sought, first, to provide a descriptive account of the inequality in the labour market
chances between individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and people from
more advantaged social class backgrounds, and of how this inequality has changed over time
in Germany. Second, we examined the role of educational inequality in accounting for the

10

difference in the labour market chances of children from unskilled working-class
backgrounds and their more advantaged peers, as well as the over-time change therein.
Our first main finding is that there appears to be a substantial gap between the labour
market chances of individuals from unskilled and skilled working-class backgrounds. More
specifically, we find a difference of about ten percentage points in the chances of the
individuals in these groups to attain a position above the two labour market cut-offs we
examine. This difference is as large as the difference in the labour market chances between
individuals from skilled working-class backgrounds and individuals from intermediate-class
origins. Our finding demonstrates that the stratification within the working class plays an
important role in the intergenerational transmission of inequality in Germany. This is likely
to be a result of the substantial difference in the working and living conditions between the
unskilled and skilled working class in Germany. In the German ‘dual labour market’,
individuals in skilled working-class positions enjoy a relatively high level of economic
security due to labour market institutions such as collective wage bargaining, employment
protection legislation and high unemployment insurance benefits, while individuals in the
unskilled working class generally receive substantially less institutional support (see
Betthäuser, 2017; Leibfried and Tennstedt, 1985).
Second, we find that the gap in the labour market chances between people from
unskilled working-class backgrounds and people from higher social class backgrounds has
not narrowed significantly across the first three birth cohorts we examine. This finding of a
persistent inequality in the labour market chances between these groups contrasts with the
pattern of increasing overall social fluidity in Germany that has been shown in past research
(Müller and Pollak, 2004; Breen and Luijk, 2007; Breen, 2010). While there appears to have
been an increase in the overall level of absolute upward mobility between the 1940s and 1950s
cohorts at the time of the German Wirtschaftswunder, this trend seems to have benefitted
individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and individuals from higher social
class backgrounds to similar extents, thus leaving relative social mobility rates of these groups
unchanged.
However, we find a decline in the labour market chances of individuals from
unskilled working-class backgrounds, relative to individuals from higher social class
backgrounds, between the 1960s birth cohort and the 1970s birth cohort. This trend may be
a result of the 1970s Oil Crisis and the concomitant welfare state retrenchment, which is
likely to have had a particularly negative effect on the economic security of families at the
bottom of the social class hierarchy. Given the importance of economic resources in the
parental generation, the differential effect of the 1970s Oil Crisis and the concomitant
welfare state retrenchment is likely to have contributed to the observed widening of the gap

11

in the labour market chances of individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and
individuals from more advantaged backgrounds. This is in line with the existing evidence on
the rigidifying effects on economic crisis on social mobility (Jackson and Evans, 2017). The
decline in the relative labour market chances of individuals from unskilled working-class
backgrounds between the 1960s birth cohort and the 1970s birth cohort that we observe
may account for the levelling-off of the trend of increasing overall social mobility that has
been demonstrated in the existing literature (see Mayer and Aisenbrey, 2007).
Our third main finding is that about half of the gap in the labour market chances
between people from unskilled working-class backgrounds and people from more
advantaged backgrounds can be attributed to the fact that children from unskilled workingclass families tend to leave school with lower educational qualifications than is the case for
children from more advantaged backgrounds. This considerable role of education in
channelling the effect of individuals’ class background on their labour market chances
appears to be stable across the four birth cohorts we examine. The finding of over-time
stability in the mediating role of education is confirmed by the results of our step-wise
analysis of the associations between individuals’ social origin, their educational attainment
and their social destination, as conceptualised through the OED triangle. In short, in all four
birth cohorts about half of the labour market disadvantage of individuals from unskilled
working-class backgrounds can be explained by the fact that they leave the educational
system with lower educational qualifications than is the case for individuals from higher
social class backgrounds. Importantly, this finding contradicts past research which claims
that education does not play a prominent role in explaining the labour market disadvantage
experienced by children from unskilled working-class families (cf. Ishida et al., 1995:177).
When interpreting over-time change in the disadvantage of people from unskilled
working-class backgrounds in terms of their educational and labour market prospects, it is
important to consider possible over-time changes in the composition of this group with
regards to different individual-level characteristics, such as cognitive and socio-emotional
attributes, family structure, number of siblings, ethnicity or the educational and sociocultural resources these individuals can rely on during their education and labour market
entry. Such compositional changes may counteract or even cancel out any potential effects
of the institutional and economic circumstances under which the different birth cohorts
received their education and entered the labour market. While a comprehensive investigation
of possible compositional changes with regards to all relevant individual-level characteristics
lies beyond the scope of this article, we investigate whether there has been any over-time
change in the cultural and educational resources that children in this group can draw on,
relative to people from more advantaged backgrounds, as indicated by their parents’ social

12

status and educational attainment (Bukodi and Goldthorpe, 2013). We find that there has
been no substantial change in this regard across the four cohorts we consider (see Table A5
in the Appendix), and the fact that the proportion of individuals with parents in unskilled
working-class positions did not change substantially across the four birth cohorts we
examine renders substantial changes in the composition of this group unlikely (see Table 2).
In sum, this article has shown the importance of examining the social mobility
patterns of specific societal groups—particularly of those that face the most disadvantaged
conditions when growing up—in addition to changes in overall social fluidity. Using this
approach, we found that—contrasting with past findings of an increase in overall social
fluidity in Germany—individuals who grow up in unskilled working-class backgrounds in
Germany have not experienced any increase in mobility, compared to individuals from more
advantaged backgrounds, across the four birth cohorts we examine. To the contrary, we find
evidence that the relative social mobility of this group has decreased for people born in the
1970s. An important task for future research will be to examine the extent to which this
trend continues for younger birth cohorts, once these have reached the stage of occupational
maturity.
1 Given that individuals’ educational experiences are known to be an important determinant of their labour
market chances in Germany (Müller and Gangl, 2003), and since educational experiences vary primarily by
birth cohort, we adopt a cohort perspective rather than a period perspective on over-time change (see, Breen
and Jonsson, 2007; Breen and Luijkx, 2007).
2 For a discussion of the micro-level mechanisms through which individuals’ parental class background is
thought to affect their educational and labour market chances, see Goldthorpe (2007); Breen and Jonsson
(2005), Jackson (2013) and Bernardi and Ballarino (2016).
3 It should be noted that here the terms ‘skilled’ and ‘unskilled’ refer to the level of skill typically used in a given
occupational group, not the level of educational attainment of the observed individuals in either occupational
group (Rose and Harrison, 2010).
4 Replicating our models using the ALLBUS data leads us to the same conclusions (see Table A2 and Figure
A1 in the Appendix). However, it should be noted that the ALLBUS data show the increase in the inequality
between individuals from unskilled and skilled working-class backgrounds to be statistically significant for the
first labour market cut-off, but not for the second labour market cut-off. We also find that same empirical
pattern when we use the UNIDIFF approach to modelling over-time changes in relative social mobility. When
modelling over-time change across the entire social class spectrum, we find stagnation across the first three
birth cohorts, but a statistically significant decline in relative mobility between the 1960 and 1970 cohort (see
Table A6). This decline in relative mobility is even more pronounced when we model changes in mobility
between individuals from unskilled working class backgrounds and individuals from higher social class
backgrounds (see Table A7), suggesting that the decline in the relative mobility chances of individuals from
unskilled working class backgrounds may drive the general pattern of relative social mobility.
5 This method extends the decomposition properties of linear models to nonlinear probability models. It is
derived from a linear latent variable model assumed to underlie the logit or probit model. For an in-depth

13

discussion of this method see Karlson et al. (2012). The method developed by Karlson et al. (2012) does not
provide confidence intervals for the estimated mediation percentages.
6 This finding also emerges from our separate analyses using the ALLBUS data (see Figure A2 in the Appendix).
Perhaps surprisingly, given the known importance of educational qualifications in determining individuals’
labour market position in Germany, our results correspond closely to those of Breen and Karlson (2014), who
find that in Britain educational attainment also accounts for about half of the effect of parental class on
individuals’ social class position.
7 It should be noted that our estimates of the proportion of the parental class effect on individuals’ social class
position that is mediated by educational attainment are lower-bound estimates, since there is likely to be some
more subtle variation in individuals’ educational attainment (such as the prestige of the school or university
attended) which is not captured in our data, but which may affect individuals’ social class position.
8 The reason for the difference between our results and those reported by Ishida et al. (1995) is likely due to
the fact that we use a decomposition method developed for the use with categorical dependent variables, while
Ishida et al. (1995) infer the importance of education in mediating the social origin effect of individuals‘ social
destination by comparing coefficients across non-linear models. The latter approach has been argued to be
inaccurate as coefficients cannot be directly compared across different nonlinear models due to the scaling
effects of the differing unobserved heterogeneity across non-linear models (see, e.g., Mood, 2010; Karlson et
al., 2012).
9 We checked that the parallel regression assumption holds by running a series of binary logit models for
different educational thresholds. We found that the results hold across these thresholds.
10 The existing literature suggests several potential mechanisms that may account for this ‘direct’ effect of
parental class on children’s class destination, including the role of parents’ professional networks and wealth
in aiding individuals’ transition into the labour market (see, e.g., Bernardi and Ballarino, 2016; Pfeffer and
Hällsten, 2012), as well as individuals’ cognitive and non-cognitive development (see, e.g., Gugushvili et al.,
2017).
11 As is the case for the results from our decomposition analysis, running our models separately using the
SOEP and the ALLBUS data lead us to the same conclusions with regards to over-time changes in the
associations of the OED triangle (see Tables A3 and A4 in the Appendix).

Notes: Parental status score is based on the normalised CAMSIS scale of social status (see Prandy
and
Lambert, 2003). The parental education score is based on a normalised composite measure of fathers’ and
mother’ education, following the approach outlines in Bukodi and Goldthorpe (2013).
