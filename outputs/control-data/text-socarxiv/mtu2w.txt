Abstract

Since the 1970s, the U.S. has experienced dramatic increases in income inequality. Although this
macro-level trend is well-established in research literature, less is known about subnational
patterns of income inequality in the U.S., particularly as they vary between and within rural and
urban localities. Using Census and ACS data, this study produces Gini estimates of within-county
income inequality and examines these trends across a six-strata urban-rural typology from 1970 to
2016. This study finds the following. Income inequality has remained consistently higher in
nonmetropolitan counties than metropolitan counties throughout the study period. However, levels
of inequality have converged by 2016, a convergence that has been driven by increases in
metropolitan counties. There are notable exceptions to the secular trend of increasing inequality.
The central Plains region has experienced decreasing levels of inequality, and inequality in large,
peripheral metropolitan counties lags noticeably behind other types of counties. Almost all lowinequality counties in 1970 have shifted to moderate- or high-inequality, such that almost no one
lives in low-inequality places by 2016. This increase in exposure to inequality has been particularly
dramatic among residents of large, central metropolitan counties. As the only county-level analysis
to track income inequality across the rural-urban continuum from 1970 to 2016, this study lays the
foundation for more sophisticated analyses that explain spatial variation in income inequality and
that account for the demographic and economic diversity of the rural and urban United States.

1. Introduction
After decades of stable or declining income inequality during the mid-twentieth century, income
disparities across the United States have increased sharply in recent decades. Beginning in the
1970s, the sustained declines in income inequality since the late 1920s were reversed, marking the
so-called Great U-Turn (Bluestone & Harrison 1988; Morris & Western 1999; Nielsen & Alderson
1997; Saez 2017). Although families in the top 10 percent of the income distribution accounted
for less than 35 percent of all U.S. income through much of the 1950s and 1970s, the top families’
share had increased to more than 50 percent of all U.S. income by 2012 (Saez 2017). The United
States now has the fourth-highest level of income inequality among OECD countries, behind
Mexico, Chile, and Turkey (OECD 2018). This is an “age of extremes” in which resources and
opportunities are concentrated among an increasingly selective segment of the population (Massey
1996; Saez 2017).
The overall contours of income inequality dynamics are well documented at the national
level (Morris & Western 1999; Piketty & Saez 2003; Saez 2017; Western et al. 2008). However,
less is known about inequality at the sub-national level, within localities (for a recent exception
see Van Heuvelen 2018). Yet it is in these spaces where most social and economic interactions
take place, and therefore where inequality is most likely to be perceived in social interactions and
to influence individuals’ behaviors and outcomes (Brush 2007; Duncan 2014; Lopez 2005;
McLaughlin et al. 2001). The limited attention to the sub-national scale has also restricted
knowledge about whether and how the dynamics of income inequality may vary between rural and
urban areas, and among different types of rural and urban localities. Such differences are expected
given major, but spatially heterogeneous economic and demographic changes over recent decades
(Bailey et al. 2014; Brown & Swanson 2004; Lichter 2012; Lichter & Brown 2011; Manduca

2019; Vias & Nelson 2006; Yang & Jensen 2015). Accordingly, this study focuses explicitly on
how county-level income inequality in the United States varies across the rural-urban continuum,
and how these patterns have changed over time.
The overall goals of this paper are to describe levels of within-county income inequality in
the rural United States since 1970, draw comparisons with income inequality dynamics in urban
areas, and describe rural and urban populations’ exposure to high- and low-inequality contexts.
Toward these broader goals we address three sets of research questions. First, how do the average
levels of income inequality differ between non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties, and across
the rural-urban continuum? How have these differentials changed over time, from 1970 to 2016?
Second, how have levels of income inequality changed within counties over this 46-year period,
and does the degree of persistence in high (and low) inequality vary between rural and urban areas?
Third and finally, to what degree have rural and urban populations been exposed to high- and lowinequality contexts as a result of where they resided, and how have these levels of exposure
changed over time? Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive profile of local income
inequality dynamics among rural and urban U.S. places and populations during a period of
increasing economic polarization at the national level.

2. Background
The distribution of household income across the U.S. population has become increasingly skewed
over recent decades (Saez 2017), but less is known about how these changes have played out at
the local level. Historical processes of uneven spatial development have resulted in significant
regional disparities in socioeconomic conditions across the United States (Chetty et al. 2014;
Iceland & Hernandez 2017; Lichter et al. 2012; Lobao et al. 2007; Thiede et al. 2018). The United

States (like other countries) is fragmented into sub-national spaces that differ in terms of their
demographic composition and social structure. As a result, the link between national-level trends
and local conditions is complex and sometimes tenuous (Thiede & Monnat 2016; Manduca 2019).
Spatial variation in the level of income inequality within sub-national regions or localities
(e.g., counties, commuting zones) may reflect differences in population characteristics and social
structure. First, given systematic differences in earnings across numerous socioeconomic axes
(e.g., race and ethnicity, educational attainment, age) in the United States (Huffman & Cohen
2004; Iceland 2019; Leicht 2008; Tamborini et al. 2015), levels of income inequality within a
given locality can be influenced by the representation of such groups in a local population. These
compositional influences operate in a somewhat mechanistic manner. For example, in the presence
of a positive correlation between educational attainment and income, a hypothetical population in
which all earners have less than a high school degree would have lower levels of income inequality
than a population in which one-in-ten earners have graduate degrees and nine-in-ten earners have
less than a high school degree. This and similar stylized examples of compositional effects find
support in the literature. For example, Moller and colleagues’ (2009) analysis of within-county
income inequality between 1970 and 2000 shows statistically and substantively significant
associations between the educational, racial, and sex composition of county populations and the
level of inequality. McLaughlin (2002) found that similar compositional variables were correlated
with changes in county-level income inequality between 1980 and 1990.
Levels of inequality may also be influenced by a locality’s social and economic structure.
Social scientists have increasingly recognized that geographic “place” contributes to levels of
inequality (Brown 2019; Soja 1989). Places vary with respect to a number of conditions that
influence how income (and other resources) are distributed, including the rigidity of social

hierarchies, the capacity of local institutions to provide education and health care, local industrialoccupational structure, and other labor market institutions that affect employment and the
economic returns to work (Duncan 2014; Lobao et al. 2007; Van Heuvelen 2018). The salience of
such place characteristics has been demonstrated in multiple empirical analyses, which show that
structural factors ranging from union density and educational spending to industrial structure
influence levels of inequality at the sub-national level (McLaughlin 2002; Moller et al. 2009; Van
Heuvelen 2018). From this perspective, place is not simply a passive unit for aggregating
populations but rather has a causal role in producing and reproducing inequality.
In this study we are particularly interested in understanding how levels of, and changes in,
inequality vary between rural and urban areas. Settlement type, so defined, represents a distinctive
place characteristic: population composition and social structure vary systematically across the
rural-urban continuum (Lichter & Brown 2011; Lichter & Ziliak 2017) and spatial isolation and
population density—the constitutive characteristics of rurality (urbanicity)—may also have
independent associations with income inequality (Moller et al. 2009). For one, rural and urban
populations vary with respect to a number of demographic characteristics and processes that are
likely to be correlated with local inequality. For example, non-metropolitan counties have
historically been characterized by lower levels of racial and ethnic diversity than metropolitan
areas but have also experienced a distinctive pattern of growth in such diversity over recent
decades (Lichter 2012; Sharp & Lee 2017). The populations of rural and urban communities have
also been differentially affected by internal migration dynamics. For example, rural areas have
experienced net out-migration to urban areas since 1980, and this process has been selective of
persons with higher education and other aspects of human capital (Carr & Kefalas 2009; USDA
ERS 2017). Selective migration dynamics have also affected urban areas over previous decades,

first as highly-educated, high-earning populations disproportionately left central cities for the
suburbs; and more recently as some large cities experience “gentrification” and the displacement
of long-term low-income residents with higher-income families (Hwang 2015; South & Crowder
1997; Wilson 1996).
Multiple dimensions of social structure also vary systematically across the rural-urban
continuum. As just one example, the industrial composition of rural and urban economies has been
historically quite different and undergone distinctive changes over time. Many rural areas across
the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, the Rio Grande Valley, and the mid-South have been dependent
on resource-based industries such as mining, plantation agriculture, and non-durable
manufacturing. Employment in these sectors has often been characterized by relatively few wellpaying jobs occupied by the owners and managers of capital, and a plethora of low-wage, lowskill production jobs (Falk & Lobao 2003; Gibbs et al. 2005; Vias & Nelson 2006). Moreover,
since production jobs are the most vulnerable to offshoring, even this precarious employment has
become scarcer in rural economies over time, potentially exacerbating inequality further
(Glasmeier & Salant 2006). Offshoring and broader patterns of de-industrialization and de-skilling
have also affected metropolitan areas, particularly in core economies where legacy manufacturers
have cut back employment or closed entirely under the pressure of technological change, foreign
competition, and organizational realignment. These and other dimensions of social structure shape
inequality by incentivizing select populations to reside (or leave) a given community and,
relatedly, affecting the distribution of resources among residents.
In addition to these rural-urban differentials in population composition and social structure,
rurality (and urbanicity) may be associated with income inequality on their own terms. Prior work
has suggested that sub-national income inequality may vary systematically between rural and

urban areas (e.g., Hertz & Silva 2019; McLaughlin 2002; Moller et al. 2009, Nord 1980). For
example, Van Heuvelen (2018) draws on the work on Simon Kuznets and other contemporary
scholars to suggest that urban areas should be characterized by higher levels of inequality than
rural places, since the former are most likely to be characterized by dynamic economies, highlyeducated workers, and other characteristics associated with the attainment of high pay that skews
the income distribution. For rural areas, the implication is that access to well-paying commuter
jobs may elevate inequality in communities that are adjacent to metropolitan areas vis-à-vis their
more isolated counterparts where virtually no well-paying jobs are available. Empirically,
however, association between rurality and sub-national income inequality has been inconsistent
and sometimes contradictory. The findings of Moller et al. (2009) suggest the need to distinguish
between cross-sectional variation across the rural-urban continuum—according to which rural
counties have higher inequality—and longitudinal variation in the degree of urbanization within a
county—according to which urbanization is positively associated with inequality levels. However,
more recent estimates suggest that even these conclusions are tenuous—at least when measured at
the commuting-zone level (Van Heuvelen 2018). We therefore take the direction of variation in
inequality along the rural-urban continuum as an empirical question.
Our updated, descriptive portrait of income inequality across the rural-urban continuum is
merited for at least three major reasons. First, we fill a gap in evidence about changing rural-urban
differentials in income inequality during a period of growing macro-level inequalities. 1 Prior work
has either not focused explicitly on rural-urban comparisons, produced estimates for only some of
the 1970-2016 time period we study here, or focused on alternative geographic scales. Our study
therefore represents the only county-level analysis to track income inequality across the rural-

as comparisons across multiple types of non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties.

urban continuum since 1970—the approximate inflection point of the “Great U-Turn”. Second and
relatedly, the United States has undergone major socioeconomic and demographic changes over
the nearly fifty-year period that we study here. These changes have arguably been most acute in
rural America, where communities have variously experienced unprecedented industrial
restructuring, population losses, population aging, and growth in racial and ethnic diversity
(Johnson & Lichter 2019; Lichter 2012; Thiede et al. 2017; Vias & Nelson 2006). A descriptive
assessment of how inequality has changed (or not) over a time period characterized by such
dramatic transformations is an important first step toward developing a causal understanding of
these processes. Third and finally, an updated account of local inequality levels across the United
States—and particularly populations’ exposures to inequality—is important given the secondorder consequences of the level of inequality in one’s place of residence. Exposure to high
inequality in particular is correlated with a range of adverse outcomes, including drug-related
mortality, firearm homicides, and child maltreatment (Eckenrode et al. 2014; Monnat 2018;
Rowhani-Rahbar et al. 2019). Understanding where and to what degree sub-national inequality has
increased (or decreased) over time should therefore be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders.

3. Objectives
The overarching goal of this study is to describe trends in within-county income inequality in the
rural and urban United States from 1970 to 2016. Our analyses address three specific objectives.
First, we estimate and compare levels of within-county income inequality in non-metropolitan and
metropolitan counties, as well as across a more detailed typology of counties that captures the
rural-urban continuum. Second, we assess whether and how levels of income inequality have
persisted over time within counties and we describe patterns of persistence between and within

non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties. Third, we evaluate whether and how the degree of
exposure to high- and low-inequality contexts has changed over time among the populations living
along the rural-urban continuum. By addressing these questions, we provide a statistical portrait
of income inequality dynamics in rural and urban America, and provide new insights into localized
patterns of income inequality during an era of increasing disparities nationally.

4. Empirical strategy
4.1. Data and measures
We produce estimates of within-county income inequality using data from the U.S. Decennial
Census and American Community Survey (ACS). Specifically, we use IPUMS-NHGIS to extract
county-level data on household income from the four Decennial Censuses conducted from 1970
to 2000, as well as the 2006-2010 and 2012-2016 ACS 5-year estimates (Manson et al. 2018). We
extract data for all counties (and equivalent units) excluding Alaska and Hawaii. These data
provide information on the number of households that fall within a defined household income
range (e.g., $0-$9,999, $10,000-$19,999, … $45,000+) for each county and each year. 2 To
measure populations’ exposure to high- and low-inequality contexts, we draw on the same data
sources to measure the population counts of each county for each time point in the study.
We use these data to estimate the Gini coefficient of household income inequality within
counties. The Gini coefficient is a commonly-used measure of inequality (Allison 1978). Ranging
from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality), this indicator corresponds to the area between
the Lorenz Curve—which plots the cumulative distribution of income against the corresponding

Loving County, TX is missing household income data for 1970. To impute the value for Loving County’s Gini coefficient in this
year, we assumed a linear trend and used the values of Loving County’s Gini in 1980 and 1990 to impute the missing value in
1970. Sensitivity checks confirmed that the results for the descriptive statistics in this paper remained highly consistent whether or
not this imputed value was included.

cumulative share of the population—and the theoretical line of equity produced when income is
distributed evenly across the population of interest. Importantly, since our study necessarily uses
household income data, the Gini coefficient is capturing the distribution of household income
across the population of households rather than among individuals.
The Gini coefficient and related measures of income inequality are typically calculated
with continuous measures of income, but the public-use data we use are limited to the binned
income measures described above. Because we cannot observe the true distribution of households
within each income bit, it must be estimated. To do so we use the robust Pareto midpoint estimator
developed by von Hippel et al. (2016). This approach assigns all cases within a given income bin
to the midpoint of that bin, except for the top two income categories. Within the latter, income
distributions are expected to be non-uniform, and in the case of the top income bin, the upper
bound is not defined. Household incomes within these top two bins are therefore assumed to follow
a Pareto distribution, which accounts for the skewed distribution of households in this upper tail
of the income distribution. The shape parameter of this distribution is defined empirically.
Following von Hippel et al. (2016), we assign the values in these top two bins the estimated
harmonic mean of household income within each category in a given year.
Using these estimates, we analyze levels and changes in within-county income inequality
between and within the non-metropolitan and metropolitan United States from 1970 to 2016. We
define counties’ metropolitan status using the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
metropolitan classification system. We apply the OMB delineations from 1993 throughout the
analysis, such that counties’ metropolitan classifications do not change over the study.3 We take
this fixed approach to ensure that reclassification does not confound our estimates of rural-urban

differences over time (Fuguitt et al. 1988). The 1993 delineation was selected since this year is the
approximate mid-point of our time period and will therefore, on average, minimize the
misclassification of counties whose metropolitan status changed over time. According to this
delineation, 2,264 counties are classified as non-metropolitan and 812 as metropolitan. To examine
variation within non-metropolitan and metropolitan categories, we use a modified version of the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Services’ (ERS) 1993 ruralurban continuum (RUC) codes. The RUC codes categorize counties according to their population
size and urbanicity, and among the largest metropolitan areas, whether the county was a central or
outlying component of the metropolitan area. The codes also distinguish between nonmetropolitan counties that are and are not adjacent to metropolitan areas, but we collapse adjacent
and non-adjacent non-metropolitan counties by population size to allow for a parsimonious
typology.4 The result is a six-category typology as follows: (1) central county of metropolitan areas
with 1 million or more residents; (2) outlying county of metropolitan areas with 1 million or more
residents; (3) county in metropolitan area of less than 1 million residents; (4) non-metropolitan
county with an urban population of 20,000 or more; (5) non-metropolitan county with an urban
population of 2,500 to 19,999; and (6) non-metropolitan county with less than 2,500 urban
residents. We refer to these categories as spanning the rural-urban continuum throughout the paper.

4.2. Methods
Our analyses proceed as follows. First, we describe levels of between-household income inequality
within non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties, as well across the rural-urban continuum, for
each period included in our data. We calculate the mean and standard deviation of within-county

population size than adjacency.

inequality levels (i.e., Gini coefficient) for each group of counties and period, and then map levels
of inequality in 1970 and 2016 to understand broader regional patterns. Second, we analyze
differences in the magnitude of absolute within-county change in income inequality between 1970
and 2016. Here again, we focus on patterns in the mean and standard deviation of these changes.
Consistent with the first step in our analysis, we examine spatial patterns of change by mapping
the absolute change in counties’ Gini coefficient between 1970 and 2016.
Third, we identify areas where inequality has been persistently high or low. We measure
such persistence by calculating the number of periods a county was characterized by high or low
absolute levels of inequality between 1970 and 2016. Here, we define low and high inequality as
cases where the Gini coefficient was less than or greater than 1.5 standard deviations below and
above the mean Gini coefficient for all county-year observations in our dataset. The approximate
values for the 1.5 standard deviation thresholds are .36 and .48, respectively, for the low and high
inequality cases. We define moderate inequality as the remaining values between and inclusive of
the 1.5 standard deviation thresholds. Across all county-years of our data, approximately 5.2
percent of counties fall below the 0.36 threshold and 6.8 percent of counties above the 0.48
threshold. Since these thresholds are ultimately somewhat arbitrary, we assess the sensitivity of
our findings by replicating the main analysis of trends in local inequality using alternative
thresholds as described in the appendices. 5 Fourth, we examine the persistence of local inequality
by describing the probability of transitioning between high, moderate, and low inequality classes
between 1970 and 2016. That is, we track the association between a county’s position at the start
of the study, in 1970, and its level of inequality 46 years later in 2016.

When comparing the results of the sensitivity analyses with those presented in the main text, the same general trends remain
consistent. For example, non-metropolitan counties are more likely to experience persistent high-inequality and less likely to
experience low-inequality than metropolitan counties.
5

Fifth, we analyze levels of, and changes in, populations’ exposure to high and low
inequality. For each year, we calculate the share of the non-metropolitan and metropolitan
populations that reside in high and low inequality counties as defined above. We calculate similar
figures for the populations within each of the six county types, and then analyze patterns of change
in such exposure to high inequality from 1970 to 2016.

5. Results
5.1 Levels and trends in within-county income inequality
We begin by analyzing patterns in the level of within-county income inequality across the ruralurban continuum from 1970 to 2016. We present descriptive statistics (Table 1) and plot trends in
the mean Gini coefficient by period for all metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties (Figure 1),
and for each of the county groups in our six-category typology (Figure 2). This analysis produces
four main findings. First, the mean level of income inequality has been higher in non-metropolitan
than metropolitan counties across the entire study period. The mean Gini coefficient was 0.427 in
non-metropolitan counties and 0.406 in metropolitan counties on average across all periods. At no
point between 1970 and 2016 has the average level of within-county income inequality across all
metropolitan counties exceeded that across all non-metropolitan counties, nor have the means of
any of the metropolitan sub-groups exceeded those of any non-metropolitan sub-group. It is
important to note, however, that disparities between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties
were much larger during the first decades of the study (see below).

Second, average levels of income inequality have tended to vary systematically across the
rural-urban continuum, producing a gradient whereby the degree of inequality is positively
correlated with rurality. Throughout the study period, the most-urbanized non-metropolitan
counties have, on average, had lower levels of inequality than the least-urbanized places. In 1990,
for example, the mean Gini coefficient was 0.402 for central counties in large metropolitan areas,
0.413 for medium and small metropolitan counties, 0.423 for highly urbanized non-metropolitan
counties; and 0.429 for the least urbanized non-metropolitan counties. The peripheral counties in
large metropolitan areas represent the key exception to this pattern: from 1980 onward, these
counties were characterized by lower average levels of income inequality than both central
counties in large metropolitan areas and counties in medium and small metropolitan areas. This
finding suggests that the metropolitan periphery experienced distinctive demographic and
socioeconomic conditions over recent decades vis-à-vis other parts of metropolitan America and
perhaps the country as a whole.
Third and relatedly, the rural-urban gradient in inequality levels has diminished over time.
The absolute gap in inequality levels between all non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties
declined by nearly 80 percent, from 0.039 in 1970 to 0.008 in 2016. A similar pattern was observed

2016

when non-metropolitan counties are decomposed according to their location in the rural-urban
continuum, as differences according to population size largely disappear by 2016. For example,
the difference between the least urbanized non-metropolitan counties and the central counties of
the largest metropolitan areas diminished from 0.068 in 1980 to essentially zero (0.001) in 2016.
Again, the key exception is among outlying counties in the largest metropolitan areas: the average
level of income inequality in these places remained relatively low and have therefore lagged far
below the other groups. Still, the overall pattern of rural-urban convergence has been driven by
disproportionate increases in mean inequality within metropolitan areas rather than declines among
non-metropolitan counties. While the average level of inequality in non-metropolitan counties
decreased slightly during two periods—1970-1980 and 2000-2010—the overall 1970-2016 period
was still characterized by a modest increase in average inequality among non-metropolitan
counties.
Fourth, there is considerable but decreasing variation in the mean inequality levels, and
trends therein. The standard deviation of county Gini coefficients declined from 1970 to 2016
across all groups of counties we study. For example, the standard deviation of the Gini coefficients
of metropolitan counties declined from 0.036 to 0.029, and among non-metropolitan counties the
standard deviation declined from 0.041 to 0.035. These patterns suggest that increases in the
average level of inequality were matched by increased uniformity of those levels. A corresponding
increase in the range of inequality levels was observed in metropolitan counties from 1970 to 2016
(from 0.264-0.493 in 1970 to 0.346-0.539 in 2016, results not shown), but the range of decrease
in non-metropolitan counties (from 0.277-0.620 in 1970 to 0.325-0.712 in 2016, results not
shown). Of course, these results may simply reflect the presence of outliers.

We next produce maps to examine spatial variation in the levels of within-county income
inequality across the United States as a whole, and among non-metropolitan and metropolitan
counties. County-level income inequality levels for 1970 and 2016 are shown in Figure 2, with
metropolitan counties outlined in black in each map for reference. The map of inequality levels in
1970 suggests a bifurcation among non-metropolitan counties that falls largely along regional
lines. In 1970, many of the highest-inequality counties in the non-metropolitan United States—
and the country as a whole—were located in the southeastern part of the country (including the
Mississippi Delta and Appalachia), the south-central Plains, the desert Southwest, and, more
sporadically, parts of the upper Midwest. By contrast, levels of inequality were distinctively lower
in the non-metropolitan Northeast, southern portions of the Mountain West, and the West Coast.

Inequality within metropolitan counties was also clearly lower than in most non-metropolitan
counties, and this is often true even in regions of the country where inequality was generally high.
In these places, the lightest shades of red (denoting lower inequality) in many metropolitan
counties stand out against the darker reds (denoting higher inequality) of surrounding nonmetropolitan areas. With that said, the limited set of metropolitan counties with high levels of
inequality are almost exclusively located in the regions of the country with the highest levels of
inequality more broadly.
Figure 2. Gini coefficient in U.S. counties, 1970 and 2016

The map of within-county inequality in 2016 reveals a considerably different spatial
pattern. By this time, the regional differences shown in 1970 have largely disappeared and high
levels of income inequality have diffused throughout the entire country. The declining gap in
income inequality between non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas shown in Figure 1 is also
reflected throughout the country rather than being concentrated in particular regions. While a
number of regions are characterized by relatively low levels of inequality—including parts of the
mountain West (e.g., Nevada, Utah, Western Colorado, and Wyoming), the central and northern

Plains, and the Midwest—few counties in these regions were characterized by the absolutely low
levels of inequality observed in those parts of the country in 1970. Even in these relatively lowinequality regions, some counties with exceptionally high levels of within-country inequality are
observed. It is also notable that by 2016 many metropolitan counties had high levels of income
inequality. These include counties in metropolitan areas adjacent to or within some of the few
remaining low-inequality regions. Whereas metropolitan counties were often ‘islands’ of low
inequality amidst high non-metropolitan inequality in 1970, the opposite appears true in 2016.

5.2 Changes in within-county income inequality, 1970 to 2016
We next examine patterns of absolute change in within-county inequality between 1970 and 2016.
We produce descriptive statistics of the change in the Gini coefficient between 1970 and 2016 for
non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties, and across the rural-urban continuum (Table 2). We
also map the geographic distribution of these changes across U.S. non-metropolitan and
metropolitan counties (Figure 3). The average absolute increase in within-county inequality from
1970 to 2016 was, at 0.041 points (SD = 0.035), considerably higher among metropolitan counties
than among non-metropolitan counties, where the average increase was just 0.010 points (SD =
0.039). These differences are consistent with the overall convergence between non-metropolitan
and metropolitan areas over the study period.
We also find differences across the rural-urban continuum. The largest average absolute
increases occurred in the central counties of large metropolitan areas (0.068 points, SD = 0.030),
followed by counties in small- and medium-sized metropolitan areas (0.037 points, SD = 0.032)
and highly urbanized non-metropolitan counties (0.034, SD = 0.026). Outlying counties of large
metropolitan areas had, on average, somewhat smaller increases of 0.023 points (SD = 0.034),

followed by moderately urbanized non-metropolitan counties (0.011, SD = 0.033). The least
urbanized non-metropolitan counties experienced essentially no change (0.001 points, SD = 0.040)
on average from 1970 to 2016.

delineations.

These overall changes in local income inequality also reflect a regional pattern, as
illustrated in the map of the absolute changes in the Gini coefficient from 1970 to 2016 for each
county (Figure 3). This map highlights the general tendency toward increased within-county
inequality over the period, but also underlines the diverse trajectories of counties. Indeed, the range
of absolute change in the county Gini coefficient from 1970 to 2016 was -0.207 to 0.262 among
non-metropolitan counties and -0.084 to 0.135 among metropolitan counties. The implication is

that non-metropolitan counties were characterized by both smaller average changes in inequality
over this period and a considerable number of outliers. The map in Figure 3 also reveals that,
broadly, the largest decreases in income inequality occurred in the central regions of the United
States, from south-central Texas to northern North Dakota. However, even in these regions, most
metropolitan counties were characterized by large increases in inequality. Such increases in
inequality were especially marked in the Great Lakes region, New England, across Appalachia,
and along the West Coast. On the one hand, the widespread increases in inequality in these regions
may simply reflect the fact that there have been secular increases in inequality in metropolitan
areas and these regions are more urbanized than the central part of the country. On the other hand,
it is notable that many of the non-metropolitan counties in the western and eastern United States
also experienced increases in inequality, which suggests that these patterns may be driven by
socioeconomic processes operating at the regional level.

5.3 Persistence of within-county income inequality over time
In addition to studying the average levels of change in inequality over time, we also analyze
the persistence (or lack thereof) of high and low inequality among various categories of counties.
Again, we define high- and low-inequality counties as those with Gini coefficients of ≥0.48 and
≤0.36, respectively, corresponding to 1.5 or more standard deviations above and below the mean
of all county-years. We begin this analysis by describing the distribution of counties according to
the number of times that they were characterized by high and low inequality throughout the study
period (Table 3). Across the six time points in our data—which span nearly fifty years—nonmetropolitan counties were much more likely than metropolitan counties to be characterized as
high inequality at least once, as well as to be characterized by high inequality across multiple time
points. Nearly 95 percent (94.8%) of metropolitan counties were never classified as high inequality
between 1970 and 2016, compared with less than three-quarters (74.8%) of non-metropolitan
counties. In contrast, 6.9 percent of non-metropolitan counties had high levels of inequality for at
least three of the six periods we consider, which was more than twice the share of metropolitan

counties (2.4%) characterized by such persistently high levels of inequality. We visualize these
results with the map of persistently high-inequality counties, so defined, in Figure 4. Persistently
high-inequality counties are concentrated in the Southeast, Southwest, and south-central Plains, as
well as in a cluster in Appalachia. There is also a small number of high-inequality non-metropolitan
counties in the Dakotas. By contrast, metropolitan counties, as delineated by the black outline,
were much less likely to have experienced persistent levels of high inequality. With regards to low
inequality, the results in Table 3 demonstrate that patterns of persistent low inequality largely
mirror those of high inequality, with a larger share of non-metropolitan counties (88.8%) never
falling below the 0.36 threshold used to define this category than metropolitan counties (66.9%).

Figure 4. Location of persistently high inequality counties, 1970 to 2016

These overall differences in the persistence of high and low inequality mask important
variation among non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties. Among non-metropolitan counties,
low- and moderately-urbanized counties had the highest rates of persistently-high inequality: 8.7
percent of the former and 6.3 percent of the latter. These figures exceed the 4.5 percent of highlyurbanized non-metropolitan counties with persistently-high inequality, so defined. Less than three
percent of all metropolitan counties were characterized by persistently-high inequality, but rates
ranged from 4.8 percent among the central counties of the largest metropolitan areas to zero among
the peripheral counties in such areas. Low inequality was uniformly rare (1.0-1.8%) for all types
of non-metropolitan counties. However, while nearly half of counties in the largest metropolitan
areas—both central (50.9%) and outlying (48.5%)—experienced at least one spell of low
inequality, just under one in three counties (23.4%) in small and moderate metropolitan areas did
so. As such, these results suggest that low inequality has been disproportionately concentrated in
large metropolitan areas.
We further examine the persistence of high and low inequality by assessing whether
counties’ initial level of inequality (in 1970) is correlated with its level of inequality at the study’s
end point in 2016. For non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties overall, and for each of the six
groups across the rural-urban continuum, we tabulate the shares of counties that started in each
level of inequality in 1970 that were respectively characterized by low, moderate, and high levels
of inequality in 2016 (Table 4). These figures allow us to assess how the probability of
transitioning across inequality categories varied between non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas,
and within the rural-urban continuum. Our results suggest that approximately one third (66.7%) of
the metropolitan counties that were classified as high inequality in 1970 remained so in 2016, and
this degree of persistence is considerably higher than among non-metropolitan counties (34.2%).

Given the relatively few metropolitan counties that were classified as high inequality in 1970,
however, we would caution against drawing strong conclusions. Counties that were classified as
moderate inequality in 1970 were most likely to remain classified as such in 2016. More than 90
percent of both the non-metropolitan and metropolitan counties that were classified as moderate
inequality in 1970 remained as such in 2016, and nearly all of the remaining counties transitioned
from moderate to high inequality. The only exceptions were the 0.9 percent of the nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties that had been classified as moderate inequality in 1970
and transitioned to low inequality in 2017. Finally, we examine patterns of transition from low
inequality. Here again we find very little in the way of overall differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties: among both groups, nearly all counties that had been
classified as low inequality had transitioned to moderate or high inequality. Only a limited number
of non-metropolitan counties were classified as low inequality in both periods.

These patterns are largely consistent when counties are decomposed across the six-category
typology representing the rural-urban continuum. Differences in transition patterns continue to be
a matter of degree rather than kind, but in some cases are substantial at that. For example, while
100 percent of the (few) central counties in large metropolitan areas that had been characterized
as high inequality in 1970 remained so in 2016, just 40.0 percent of the highly urbanized nonmetropolitan counties that were classified as high inequality as of 1970 remained so in 2016. This
percentage was even smaller among the least-urbanized non-metropolitan counties, among which
just 26.3 percent were classified as high inequality in 1970 and 2016. We also observe differences
with respect to the inequality trajectories of counties that started, in 1970, with moderate levels of
inequality. Nearly 10 percent (9.7%) of the least urbanized non-metropolitan counties classified as
moderate inequality transitioned to high inequality in 2016. This transition rate is approximately
3 percentage points more than among highly urbanized non-metropolitan counties but less than
the 16.7 percent of the central counties in large metropolitan areas classified as moderate inequality
in 1970 that transitioned to high inequality by 2016. By contrast, none of the peripheral counties

L

in large metropolitan areas that were classified as moderate inequality transitioned to high
inequality in 2016—and a full 5.8 percent transitioned to low inequality.
It is important to note that the percentages referred to above may mask differences in the
absolute number of counties transitioning from one level of inequality to the next. We therefore
also illustrate counties’ transitions across levels of inequality from 1970 to 2016 by plotting each
counties’ Gini coefficient in 1970 (vertical axis) against its 2016 value (horizontal axis) for each
of the six groups across the rural-urban continuum (Figure 5). These plots have been overlaid with
horizontal and vertical lines to denote the high and low thresholds defined for the county-year data.
Similar to the results shown in Table 4, a county’s initial level of inequality in 1970 is fairly
predictive of its inequality level in 2016. Also consistent with our prior findings, virtually all of
the counties characterized by low inequality in 1970 had transitioned to moderate or high levels of
inequality by 2016.

5.4 Populations’ exposure to income inequality
Our final analysis examines the extent to which non-metropolitan and metropolitan
populations resided in high- and low-inequality communities. Since populations are distributed
unevenly across counties, this part of the study is an important corollary to our previous analyses,
which treated counties as the sole unit of analysis. Indeed, from a policy perspective, one could
argue that the degree of populations’ exposure to high- or low-inequality contexts is equally or
more important than the number of localities characterized by such economic conditions. We
address this question by calculating the share of the non-metropolitan and metropolitan
populations, as well as the sub-populations defined by our 6-category typology, that resided in
high- and low- inequality counties during the six time points in our data (Table 5). Overall, the
share of the non-metropolitan population that resided in high-inequality counties increased by less
than two percentage points between 1970 and 2016, from 5.7 percent in 1970 to 7.6 percent in
2016. This relatively small uptick was dwarfed by a 7.2 percentage point increase in the share of
the metropolitan population residing in high-inequality counties, from 1.0 to 8.2 percent. By 2016,
a larger (0.6 percentage points) share of the metropolitan population lived in high-inequality
contexts than the non-metropolitan population. This figure represents a reversal from the 4.7
percentage-point non-metropolitan disadvantage in population exposure to high inequality that
was observed in 1970. The growing exposure to high-inequality contexts within the metropolitan
population was driven largely by inequality and population dynamics in the central counties of
very large metropolitan areas—where the population share exposed to high inequality increased
from 1.6 to 12.6 percent—and counties in small- and moderate-sized metropolitan areas—where
the corresponding population shares increased from 0.2 to 3.0 percent. A negligible share of the

population in peripheral counties of very large metropolitan areas resided in high-inequality
contexts across the study period.

Increases in the total share of the non-metropolitan population exposed to high-inequality
contexts were driven by highly-urbanized non-metropolitan counties, and—to a lesser extent—
moderately-urbanized non-metro counties. Increases were most pronounced in the highlyurbanized non-metropolitan counties, where just 1.9 percent of the population resided in high-

inequality counties in 1970 but 5.7 percent of the population lived in such places in 2016.
Comparatively, increases in exposure to high inequality were more modest among moderatelyurbanized non-metro counties (1.9 percentage points), and this trend was reversed among the leasturbanized non-metropolitan counties, where exposure to high levels of inequality decreased from
12.2 to 9.8 percent between 1970 and 2016.
Dynamics with respect to the populations’ exposure to low inequality are markedly
different. By 2016, virtually none of the U.S. population resided in low inequality counties. As
such, the only difference between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties (and across the
rural-urban continuum) that emerges pertain to the baseline (1970) exposure levels. While
relatively small shares of the non-metropolitan population were ever exposed to low levels of
inequality over the study period, substantial shares of the metropolitan population resided in lowinequality contexts for many decades. Indeed, nearly a third of the population in counties within
the largest metropolitan areas was exposed to low inequality contexts in 1970, including more than
55 percent of the population in the peripheral counties within such areas. By 2016, however, this
share had fallen to less than seven percent (6.8%). Clearly, the growing number of counties
characterized by high levels of income inequality is translating into a growing likelihood that
people will reside in such places.

6. Discussion and conclusion
Our new estimates of within-county income inequality dynamics from 1970 to 2016 demonstrate
that the well-documented increases in income inequality at the national level are also playing out
within many localities. Our study placed renewed attention on patterns of within-county income
inequality in non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas and across the rural-urban continuum,

which were expected to vary given substantial and heterogeneous economic and demographic
changes over recent decades.
Our results support five major findings. First, high levels of local income inequality have
historically been more characteristic of non-metropolitan than metropolitan areas within the period
of this study, with rural counties consistently having the highest levels of income inequality from
1970 to 2016. Second, levels of within-county income inequality have converged between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas over time. In other words, the initial negative association
between the level of urbanization and the degree of inequality had nearly been eliminated by 2016.
This convergence was near-complete by 2016 and has been driven by increases in inequality within
metropolitan counties rather than systematic decreases in inequality within non-metropolitan
counties. This pattern raises questions about both the drivers of the rapid increase in metropolitan
inequality and the persistence of high inequality among non-metropolitan counties.
Third, patterns of change in the level of inequality varied dramatically across different
regions of the country. In some cases (e.g., the central Plains), we observed widespread declines
in inequality despite a secular trend toward higher inequality. Likewise, we observed that income
inequality within the peripheral counties of large metropolitan areas lagged noticeably behind all
other metro and non-metro counties across the rural-urban continuum. In other cases, the general
tendency toward increased inequality was amplified and exceptionally large increases in inequality
were observed. Such cases were particularly common in metropolitan areas of the Midwest and
along both coasts.
Fourth, our findings show that counties’ income inequality levels are relatively persistent
over time, except at the lower end of the inequality distribution. A large majority of the counties
that started the study period with moderate levels of inequality remained at that level in 2016, and

most counties characterized by high inequality in 1970 were classified as either high or moderate
inequality in 2016. In contrast, virtually all of the counties characterized by low inequality in 1970
had transitioned to moderate or high levels of inequality by 2016. Fifth and finally, increases in
the average level of inequality among counties were paralleled by non-trivial growth in the share
of populations residing in high-inequality places and thus potentially subject to the adverse social
and epidemiological effects of such places (Eckenrode et al. 2014; Monnat 2018; Rowhani-Rahbar
et al. 2019). This growth has been particularly dramatic among the metropolitan population, such
that the predominance of non-metropolitan counties in high-inequality contexts in 1970 was
reversed by 2016. It is important to note, however, that substantial percentages of both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan populations lived in a high-inequality county in 2016 (8.2% and
7.6%, respectively), and virtually no one currently lives in a low inequality county.
Together, these findings provide a new empirical baseline for our understanding of local
income inequality dynamics in the rural and urban United States. Given the dearth of research on
sub-national income inequality that pays explicit attention to patterns of temporal change across
the rural-urban continuum, we anticipate that these findings should motivate additional research
by social scientists interested in spatial inequality. At least three major lines of inquiry emerge
from this study. First and perhaps foremost, additional research is needed to understand the
determinants—or at least correlates—of the changes in inequality that we track here. Our study
was necessarily descriptive but raises questions about the drivers of the rural-urban convergence
we document, as well as heterogeneous patterns of income inequality within both urban and rural
regions. The differences we document between core and peripheral counties in the largest
metropolitan areas is a case in point. The sharp increases in inequality among central counties of
large metropolitan areas contrasts with the observed dynamics among peripheral counties, which

experienced the lowest average increases of all county types over the study period. This pattern
raises questions about how demographic and economic change diverged between the core and
periphery or large metropolitan areas.
Additionally, overall levels of inequality have remained persistently high among nonmetropolitan counties despite major economic and demographic shifts in such areas. Though
persistently high on average, however, levels of income inequality in the rural United States have
not been uniform or linear over the time period of this study. Moreover, when we examine a more
refined gradient of rural communities along the rural-urban continuum, distinctive patterns emerge
among different types of rural communities. The experience of highly urbanized non-metropolitan
counties provides an especially interesting comparison to least- and moderately-urbanized nonmetropolitan counties. The trajectory of these highly urbanized non-metropolitan areas is more
similar to those of metropolitan counties, with respect to both their starting levels of inequality in
1970 and changes from 1970 to 2016. The labor market characteristics, such as proximity/access
to urban markets and commuting patterns, of rural areas merits a more detailed examination,
particularly with regards to rural areas that are adjacent to larger metropolitan areas and rural areas
that are more remote. We anticipate that other economic and demographic characteristics within
rural communities, such as economic structure and population change, differentially impact the
dynamics of household income distribution and consequent levels of income inequality in these
communities.
Future research should also systematically compare income inequality dynamics at
multiple spatial scales and with different operational definitions of rurality. For example, do
estimates of within-county inequality differ from those at the commuting-zone level, and if so,
how? Likewise, a systematic analysis of the respective contributions of within- and between-

county income inequality to national-level increases in inequality would help to put the trends we
document into a broader context. Different operational definitions of rurality would also be worth
examining in further depth.
Finally, future research should identify the extent to which high levels of local inequality
co-occur with other forms of disadvantage, such as concentrated poverty and residential
segregation (Reardon & Bischoff 2011), and analyze how these relationships vary between rural
and urban areas. How do poverty and inequality dynamics correspond to each other within counties
over time? How might the co-occurrence of poverty and income inequality compound the adverse
effects of each for the populations residing in these counties? We anticipate that our descriptive,
longitudinal summary of county-level income inequality across the rural-urban continuum will
spur future research on these and other questions about sub-national income inequality during an
era of dramatic macro-level inequalities in the United States.
