Organizational Learning Orientation for More Competitive and Accountable
Government-Linked Companies in Malaysia
Abstract
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) are expected to show competitive performance in
order to reflect the accountability of taxpayers’ money. Therefore, this study is an attempt to
assess the status of the current level of organizational learning orientation among the
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. This study collected primary data based
on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia.
The data were collected based on opinions of the ten factors of organizational learning
practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive
statistics. Further, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s alpha test, the
validity of the data was tested by checking the normality test through skewness and kurtosis,
and the consistency of the data was tested using factor analysis. On an average, 74.6% of the
respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of organizational learning. The federal
owned GLCs place more emphasis on organizational learning than the state owned GLCs.
This study suggests improving the practices of organizational learning within the GLCs in
Malaysia by emphasizing on the consideration that employee learning is an investment rather
than an expense, employees should view themselves as partners in charting the direction of
the organization, employees should not be afraid of critically reflecting on the shared
assumptions about the ways of managing the organization, and by analyzing unsuccessful
organizational endeavours and communicating the lessons learned widely among the
employees.

1. Introduction
The resource-based view theory (RBV) focuses on transforming valuable resources of the
organization to assist in achieving its goals (Barney, 1991). RBV states that organizations
that are able to use or fully utilize their resources, such as raw materials, skills, etc., will have
the opportunity to gain competitive advantages over their competitors (Grant, 1991), and
offer sustainable competitive advantage to the organization (Macfarlane, 2014). Competitive
advantage is a situation where the organization is able to create or improve its product and
make it superior to the competitors’ product. Sustainable competitive advantage will help the
organization cope with the changes in the environment and stay successful in the future
(Ketchen & Short, 2014) by achieving long-term competitive advantage, which will be costly
and difficult to imitate by their competitors (Papulova & Papulova, 2006).
Sustainable competitive advantage can bring many advantages, as it is a powerful
source for the organization to achieve superior performance and create value for the
organization (Gupta & Benson, 2011). According to Barney (1991), organizations could
create competitive advantages by obtaining valuable, rare, inimitable resources, and
capabilities. Obtaining such resources will lead to value creation and sustainability in the
organization. Kraaijenbrink & Spender (2011) also state that without value creation, the
organization would have no added value and thus, there would be no reason for the
organization to exist in the market. Value creation can improve the performance of the

organization by maximizing earnings per share, ensure high levels of operational
effectiveness, and remain competitive (Gholami, 2011). This will indirectly help the
organization to implement strategies to improve their efficiency and competitiveness (Porter,
1997).
However, there is no guarantee that all of the resources will lead to competitive
advantage or value creation. This is because, according to Kraaijenbrink and Spender (2011),
people may perceive values differently. What one perceives as valuable may not be the same
for another person. Moreover, due to globalization and the increase in competition, it is hard
for organizations to sustain and cope with the rapid changes in the environment. Therefore,
organizations must be able to offer or create something new in order to differentiate
themselves from their competitors. According to Prieto and Revilla (2006), organizations that
are able to offer something different in the market have the potential to achieve superior
performance and are able to create value for their organization.
Therefore, in order to ensure the sustainability of some government agencies, the
government of Malaysia decided to privatize the companies, which led to the formation of the
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs). GLCs are defined as companies that achieve the
primary commercial objective of the Malaysian government (Khazanah, 2014) and the
Malaysian government has a direct controlling stake in these companies (OECD, 2013). The
controlling stake refers not only to the percentage of their ownership, but also their direct or
indirect influence in the appointment of directors and senior management officers. They also
make major decisions such as contracting awards, strategizing, restructuring, financing, and
acquisition and divestments through Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs). In
other words, GLCs are controlled by the Malaysian government via GLICs, Khazanah,
Ministry of Finance Inc. (MOF), Employees Provident Fund (EPF), and Bank Negara
Malaysia (BNM).1
GLCs cover a wide spectrum of economic activities from infrastructure,
telecommunication, agriculture, to financial services. Thus, GLCs play an important role in
the operation of every commercial concern in Malaysia and contribute significantly towards
improving the quality of life for the public (Abdullah, 2007; Razak, 2012). GLCs are a
corporate entity that may be a private company or a public listed company. However, GLCs
only account for about five percent of the total companies in Bursa Malaysia (formerly
known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange or KLSE), GLCs’ market capitalization amounts to
RM 232 billion, which is more than half of Malaysia’s Gross Domestic Product (Md Zin &
Sulaiman, 2011).
The main objective of an organization is to improve the performance and the business
process of the organization so that they will be as competitive as other companies in the
market (Aivazian, Ge, & Qiu, 2005). According to Phua (2001), the government economic
planners believe that the privatization of public services would bring many advantages to the
country. This is in line with past evidence that agrees privatization could increase the
efficiency of the organization, greater utilization of growth opportunities, reduce the
administrative and financial burdens of the Malaysian government, and increase Bumiputera
participants in the corporate sector (Nambiar, 2009). However, there are issues in which
GLCs are labelled as underperforming, as they deal with dual objectives, which are to make
profits and fulfil social obligations. This has given GLCs an adverse image.

Therefore, to overcome the underperformance issue, in May 2004, the government
introduced the GLC Transformation Programme. The main objective of this programme is to
improve the performance of GLCs and all corporate sectors so that they would perform
successfully. This transformation program is important as it is one of the journeys for the
organization to achieve Vision 2020. Quite a few GLCs have been successful in
implementing the programme, such as Telekom Malaysia, Malaysian Airport Holding Berhad
(MAHB), and United Engineering Malaysia (UEM) Group Berhad. These companies have
turned out to be more profitable and have been recognized internationally (Md Zin &
Sulaiman, 2011).
However, past studies still show that GLCs lack value creation compared to nonGLCs (Entebang, 2010; Mohamad & Said, 2011; Lau & Tong, 2008; Feng, and Sun, & Tong,
2004; Razak et al., 2011). Muslim, Hafiz, and Fekri Ali (2012) state that GLCs have suffered
from recurring poor firm performances due to the lack of value creation in their organization,
which has made them come under the government’s scrutiny. Razak et al. (2011) find that
non-GLCs’ performances are better than GLCs in terms of their corporate governance and
other forms of specific characteristics, which makes them create more value than GLCs. This
is because GLCs do not focus too much on maximizing profits, as they are also concerned
about contributing towards nation building (Lau & Tong, 2008).
Several GLCs are unable to create value and thus suffer from poor performances such
as the Malaysian Airline System (MAS) and Proton Holding Berhad. Hence, GLCs need to
put in extra initiatives to create value so that they will be able to meet the requirements and
expectations of the government and at the same time, be able to increase and add value to
their products, services, and business performance (Lawler & Mohrman, 2013; Aziz et al.,
2015a,b,c; Said et al., 2015, 2016). Khazanah (2014) states that GLCs are expected to
improve and enhance their value creation by focusing on sustainable practices and execution
from 2015 onwards. Currently, GLCs, especially the G202 companies, have started to focus
on sustainable practices to achieve long-term value creation. However, some GLCs tend to
undermine the importance of sustainable practices as they have several goals to accomplish.
Moreover, there are currently limited researches done on value creation in Malaysian GLCs
(Lau & Tong, 2008).
Under this circumstance, this study investigates the practices of sustainable
competitive advantage strategies among different categories of Government-Linked
Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. Organizational learning is considered one of the most
important elements to gain a sustainable competitive advantage (Kloot, 1997; Garavan, 1997;
Choe, 2002; Ramin et al., 2013). According to Purhaghshenas and Esmatnia (2012), learning
processes occur when there is a change in ideas and viewpoints in the organization. These
changes will create new ideas and point of views through communication and interaction in
the organization. Learning orientation emphasizes on the development and adaptation of
knowledge in the organization, while organizational learning focuses on acquisition of
knowledge and skills by the employees of the organization, such as by sending them for
training (Mavondo, Chimhanzi, & Stewart, 2005).

G20 is the selection of large GLCs, which are controlled by GLICs under the GLCT Programme and is used as
a proxy for performance of the GLCs. However, the G20 currently consists of only 17GLCs due to mergers,
demergers, divestments, and other corporate exercises over the years.

Organizational learning enables the organization to do continuous improvement, and
enhance employee knowledge, skills, and attitude, which would contribute to value creation
(Chawla & Joshi, 2011). In addition, organizational learning is also an advantage for
organizations to have better futures (Singh, 2011). This is because organizations that practice
organizational learning will be able to receive the newest updates in terms of knowledge
regarding the markets, customers, competitors, and environments. This would make them be
prepared to update their strategies and produce more skilled employees. Additionally,
according to Singh (2011), organizational learning is considered a long-term activity that
contributes to competitive advantage. However, to ensure the success of organizational
learning, it requires the organization to give its full commitment, attention, and effort.
Purhaghshenas and Esmatnia (2012) state that organizational learning can create value by
providing new ideas, change of ideas within the organization through communication, and
sharing of knowledge between the employees of the organization.
The government of Malaysia is focused on developing non-physical infrastructures,
which include human capital development or skills development (Prime Minister’s
Department, 2010). This enables organizations to implement an organizational learning
culture and gain skilled and knowledgeable employees through the learning and development
process. This will indirectly help organizations in gaining competitive advantages and
creating value, as employees are able to respond and act rationally during emergency
situations. Therefore, this study investigates the practices of organizational learning as a
strategy for sustainable competitive advantage among different categories of GovernmentLinked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia.
2. Methodology
2.1 Sampling and Data Collection

The respondents are asked to compare all the practices of innovation in their
organization against their competitors in the same industry for at least three years. The
questionnaire uses a five-point Likert rating scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree).
2.3 Data Analysis
The data are analysed using descriptive statistics. Factor analysis is used to measure the
consistency of the data. Further, the reliability of the data is tested using the Cronbach’s alpha
test. Finally, the data validity is tested by checking the normality of data through skewness
and kurtosis.

Among all the factors of organizational learning, the highest mean score is 4.15 for
the factor of encouraging employees to think outside the box (L7), and the lowest mean score
is 3.72 for the factor of not afraid to reflect critically on the shared assumptions about the
ways of managing the organization (L6) (Table 2). The average mean value is 3.93. There is
scope to improve the overall organizational learning by emphasizing on the factors that are
below the average score such as by considering employee learning as an investment, not an
expense (L1), employees view themselves as partners in charting the direction of the
organization (L5), employees are not afraid to reflect critically on the shared assumptions
about the ways of managing the organization (L6), and analyzing unsuccessful organizational
endeavours and communicating the lessons learned widely (L9).

Overall, the federal owned GLCs emphasize more on the factors of organizational
learning than the state owned GLCs (Table 3). Among the factors of organizational learning,
the state owned GLCs emphasize the most on employee commitment to the goals of this
organization (L4) and sharing knowledge in the organization (L10), and emphasize the least
on not afraid to reflect critically on the shared assumptions about the ways of managing the
organization (L6). On the other hand, the federal owned GLCs place the most emphasis on
encouraging employees to think outside the box (L7) and place the least emphasis on
analyzing unsuccessful organizational endeavours and communicating the learned lessons
(L9).
The GLCs engaged in the manufacturing sector are more focused on organizational
learning than other sectors (Table 3). These manufacturing GLCs emphasize the most on
considering employee learning as an investment rather than an expense (L1) and emphasize
the least on analyzing unsuccessful organizational endeavours and communicating the
learned lessons (L9) and sharing knowledge in the organization (L10). The GLCs engaged in
the service sector place the most emphasis on considering the organization’s ability to learn
as the key to gain a competitive advantage (L2) and the least emphasis on analyzing
unsuccessful organizational endeavours and communicating the learned lessons (L9).
3.3 Diagnostic Test
3.3.1 Consistency Test
The factor analysis provides the consistency of these variables for organizational learning
measurement. The factor loadings for all the variables are more than 0.6, except L10 (Table
2). Among the other nine variables, the ranges of the loading value of the factor is from 0.64
(L9) to 0.8 (L1). This indicates that nine out of the ten variables are good to measure the
practices of organizational learning in the GLCs of Malaysia.
3.3.2 Normality Test

The normality test is performed to check the distribution of data. According to Pallant (2013),
the normality of the data can be described by using the skewness and kurtosis tests, where the
data can be considered normally distributed when the kurtosis value is between -3 to 3 and
the skewness value is below zero. For the factors of organizational learning, the skewness
value is -0.475, and the kurtosis value is -0.054, which are within the acceptable range.
Therefore, the data can be considered as normally distributed.
3.3.3 Reliability Test
The Cronbach’s alpha (Table 4) value on organizational learning is 0.88, which indicates the
reliability of the questions is excellent (George & Mallery, 2003). The eigenvalue for the test
indicates that the factor used in organizational learning explains the 48.7% variance. The
Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test indicates a value greater than 0.6 at 0.828 (Chi-Square = 634, p <
0.000). Therefore, the sample is adequate to be used in the factorial analysis. Generally, the
test supports the variables of organizational learning in this study.

4. Conclusion and Recommendation
Malaysia has targeted to achieve Vision 2020 to become a developed nation, but there are
many more steps to be taken in importing value creation in GLCs. This study measured the
status of the current practices of organizational learning among different categories of GLCs
in Malaysia by assessing ten related factors. The factor analysis provided the consistency of
the ten variables for organizational learning measurement. 74.6% of the respondents admitted
to exercising these ten factors of organizational learning, and their average score was 3.93 out
of a 5 scale.
Therefore, there is scope for improving the practices of organizational learning by the
GLCs. Hence, the GLCs need to put in extra initiatives to create value so that they will be
able to meet the requirements and expectations of the government and at the same time, be
able to increase and add value to their products, services and business performance (Lawler
& Mohrman, 2013). Overall, to improve the organizational learning practices, GLCs should
emphasize on considering employee learning as an investment and not an expense,
employees should view themselves as partners in charting the direction of the organization,
employees should not be afraid to reflect critically on the shared assumptions about the ways
of managing the organization and analyzing unsuccessful organizational endeavours and
communicating the lessons learned widely. However, the state owned or federal owned GLCs
and GLCs engaged in the manufacturing or service sectors should emphasize on more
focused areas for their improvement.
