Behind the Wall: An Exploration of Public Access to Research Articles in
Social Work Journals
Kimberly Pendell
Abstract: Despite implicit and explicit expectations that research inform their practice,
social workers are unlikely to have access to published research articles. The traditional
publishing model does not support public access (i.e., no publisher paywall barrier) to
scholarly journals. Newer models of publishing allow free access to research including
open access publishing and deposit of scholarship in institutional or disciplinary
repositories. This study examined public access to articles in the top 25 social work
journals. A random sample of article citations from a total of 1,587 was assessed, with the
result that 52% of citations had no full-text access. Of the remaining 48% of citations with
full-text access, it is questionable most will remain available long term due to possible
copyright violations. Citations from the random sample show only minimal usage of
institutional or disciplinary repositories as a means of sharing research. Establishing this
baseline measure of access to research is an important first step in understanding the
barriers for social workers in accessing research to inform practice. Recommendations for
increasing access to research include publishing in open access journals and utilizing full
text repositories.

Evidence-based Practice
As a social work librarian, I have many conversations with students regarding access
to research articles. When students get close to graduation they often inquire if and how
they might still use the library’s databases and full-text journal access. Unfortunately, my
answer is always disappointing. After graduation, their off-campus access to our electronic
resources ends, and their only remaining means of access is to come into the Library to use
public access computers or connect to campus guest wi-fi, which of course hardly anyone
has time to do with busy work days and other obligations. Graduating social work students
already know from their field placements that access to full-text journals is not often
available from agencies either. In a focus group study on lifelong learning by Jivanjee,
Pendell, Nissan, and Goodluck (2016), one MSW student expressed her concern:
I love libraries, but I know that my access to this library in particular is going to
be next to nil once I graduate… There isn’t much out there for those of us that like
research and want to base it [practice] on research. We are a little bit in a hole. (p.
267)
The Dean of the School of Social Work at my institution has informed me that she
continually receives requests from alumni for off-campus access to databases and full-text
journals. This access is seen as one of the most useful benefits they could receive. Aside
from stripped down alumni packages from vendors, academic publisher and other vendor

licenses prevent the Library from extending access to individuals not actively affiliated
with the University. It is commonly recognized by librarians that even if licenses were to
permit access equivalent to that of affiliated users, the cost and management of providing
the level of access desired would be enormous and complicated. Anecdotally, many fellow
social work librarians are familiar with this dilemma of graduating students and alumni
requesting services and resources that cannot be provided.
That students and alumni expect, or at least hope, for access to research literature is
understandable considering their recent education and the professional standards laid out
for them. For example, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW, 2017) Code
of Ethics Standard 4.01 outlines the expectation that:
(b) Social workers should strive to become and remain proficient in professional
practice and the performance of professional functions. Social workers should
critically examine and keep current with emerging knowledge relevant to
social work. Social workers should routinely review the professional literature
and participate in continuing education relevant to social work practice and
social work ethics.
(c) Social workers should base practice on recognized knowledge, including
empirically-based knowledge, relevant to social work and social work ethics.
Additionally, evidence-based practice (EBP), or similar research-informed practices in the
field, overtly expect, or at least imply, that social workers have meaningful access to
research relevant to their practice needs.
It would also seem safe to assume that researchers want their efforts to influence
practice in the field and improve the lives of the communities with whom they work. The
NASW has expressed interest in connecting research to practice. The NASW Action
Network for Social Work Education and Research (n.d.) states: “Social work research
provides empirical support for best practice approaches to improve service delivery and
public policies.” Additionally, an NASW (n.d.) advocacy briefing on social work research
offers among its recommendations: “Promote the dissemination and implementation of
research into real world settings and to encourage communication between researchers and
practitioners” (p. 2).
Observing the tension between production of research for the field and the field’s lack
of access to research, this study attempts to answer an initial, primary question: if a
practicing professional wants to read research literature, is the research literature available
to them? Ten years ago or more, the answer would likely have been “no,” as the traditional,
subscription-based publishing model held content more firmly behind paywalls. The
traditional model of publishing severely limits the public’s access to research literature,
despite the content and peer review expertise provided by researchers, most often gratis
(see Figure 1).

However, new pathways to research articles have been created and cultivated,
particularly open access (OA) publishing and use of disciplinary or institutional
repositories (IRs; see Figure 2). Articles published in OA journals, such as Advances in
Social Work and Behavior and Social Issues are referred to as “gold” OA meaning that
access is provided directly via the publisher. Access provided via institutional or
disciplinary repositories is referred to as “green” OA, and the articles are usually in
manuscript form, either prior to peer review or post peer review (referred to as pre-print
and post-print respectively).

The gold OA publishing model removes the cost burden of access from the public,
replacing financial support for journals via a variety of models, such as subsidies,
donations, or membership dues for professional association journals. Repositories also
provide public access to research, but a bit differently; the ability to deposit an article might
be subject to an embargo period, or, at times, only the pre or post-print version may be
deposited, not the publisher’s final formatted version. In the early 2000’s, IRs were
developed as universities leveraged new technology to create stable access to the research
output of their communities. Adding public access to this effort was a natural fit.
Additionally, disciplinary repositories were on the rise, particularly in the hard sciences
where sharing research quickly is highly valued. Both IRs and disciplinary repositories
serve as a primary means for sharing publicly funded research; for example,
PubMedCentral (PMC), a health sciences research repository, has grown rapidly since the
implementation of the National Institutes of Health public access policy of 2008 (National
Institutes of Health, 2016).
This study examines public access (i.e., no paywall barrier) to articles in the top 25
social work related journals. While none of the journals in the sample set are published
OA, they each allow the author to archive a version of the article in an institutional or
disciplinary repository. Measuring the amount of engagement in self-archiving and
availability of research in social work is an important first step in advocating for
practitioner and public access.
Quantifying the societal or practice-related impact of freely accessible research
literature is challenging; however, it is possible to identify benefits of OA indirectly,
especially through the lens of inefficiencies. In a study of government officials’ use of
research, performed early in the development of OA publishing, Willinsky (2003) found
that:
The research that is most easily accessible, through portals and open-access sites,
is most often consulted, as policymakers referred to how readily they were
dissuaded from using pay-per-view and subscription services in their pursuit of
knowledge. This means that they are tapping into a skewed and somewhat
haphazard view of the current state of knowledge on a given topic. (p. 12)
Unfortunately, almost ten years later, Look and Marsh (2012) found similar results in their
study of public sector employees. For example, the participants “noted that they submitted
analysis or made decisions on the basis of potentially incomplete research as they had not
been able to review all the relevant articles they had identified” (p. 29) or that decisions
were delayed due to lack of access.
Given the demands on social workers to stay up-to-date in their practice, use research
to inform decisions, and to participate in continuing education and lifelong learning, easy
access to research literature can only be a benefit. But, the traditional scholarly publishing
model is still focused on providing research to other researchers, and not extending into
the practitioner and public audiences. As an example of a different approach to the
dissemination of scholarship, Advances in Social Work (AISW), one of the few social work
OA journals, states in its Open Access Policy “This journal provides immediate open

Pendell/BEHIND THE WALL

1045

access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public
supports a greater global exchange of knowledge” (AISW, n.d.).

Literature Review
Aside from the earlier recommendation of promoting dissemination of research by
NASW, there appears to be little, if any, conversation in social work related journals
regarding access to research for practitioners. Several keyword and related subject heading
searches for open access or dissemination of research in Social Services Abstracts, Google
Scholar, and Web of Science returned very few relevant results. Bowen, Mattaini, and De
Groote (2013) was the only study found that explicitly addresses access to research
literature and open access publishing.
Another, albeit brief, exception to the quiet was “Suggestions to Improve Social Work
Journal Editorial and Peer-Review Processes: The San Antonio Response to the Miami
Statement” (Holden et al., 2008) which offers fifty responses from a subcommittee of the
Society for Social Work and Research Presidential Task Force to an earlier “Miami”
statement, which was also concerned with improving journal publication processes. Both
of these statements centered on concerns regarding scholarly communication via social
work journals (Holden et al., 2008; Schilling et al., 2005). Recommendation 48 of the “San
Antonio” response states: “Publishers should consider ways in which they can increase the
free flow of scholarly communication (e.g., removing restrictive practices regarding the
use of copyrighted materials, becoming a green journal, and removing publication process
obstacles in the production realm)” (Holden et al., 2008, p. 69).
The primary source of any data or discussion regarding access to research literature in
social work is primarily found in studies related to EBP because a key component of EBP
is finding research that matches one’s particular clinical or practice question. Often, the
expectation that one can access the needed research is implicit, and perhaps taken for
granted. But studies looking specifically at EBP in the field of social work have
demonstrated that needed information access is not typically available:
Seven of the studies identified poor access to available research evidence as a
barrier to EBP implementation. The need to invest resources in staffed library
facilities and information technology to access web-based databases was identified
as a requirement if there were to be a movement from EBP as an aspiration to a
reality. (Gray, Joy, Plath, & Webb, 2013, p. 163)
Lack of access to information resources was also cited as one of the top three barriers to
EBP in a study recent of Romanian social workers (Iovu, Goian, & Runcan, 2015).
It is interesting to observe dramatic differences in engagement with EBP between
practitioners in the field and students. Van der Zwet, Weling, Beneken genaamd Kolmer,
and Schalk (2017) explored if social workers simultaneously enrolled in an MSW program
were more engaged with EBP than their non-enrolled counterparts. Indeed, the difference
appeared substantial; only 12.3% of social workers reported that they “use the Internet to
search for the best research evidence to guide my practice decisions,” in contrast to almost
60% of social worker/MSW students. The study does not further clarify or explore what

ADVANCES IN SOCIAL WORK, Fall 2018, 18(4)

1046

type of information found on the Internet is being used; however, articles seem likely to be
part of this scope. Additionally, 75% of MSW students “often” or “very often” read
research evidence as part of their EBP process, again in contrast to only 10.6% of
practitioners (Van der Zwet et al., 2017, p. 84). A question that arises from this study is to
what extent access plays a role in identification and use of research evidence. It can be
assumed that the MSW students in the study have full-text journal access via their
university affiliation, while the practitioners do not. Would we observe more use of
research if practitioners had the same access as students?
Hardisty and Haaga (2008) attempted to answer this question by exploring the impact
of access to articles to influence behavior/practice change. Their unique study explored
participants’ behavior when asked to access an article that was freely available versus other
means of access, including needing to pay for the article. A significantly higher proportion
of participants read the article when it was freely available to them (70%; p. 831). The
same authors also tested for the potential of the participants to implement recommendations
from the article in a relevant hypothetical scenario, finding a positive result.
“Dissemination efforts that come with a price tag may prove less effective, even if they are
promoted more heavily, than dissemination efforts that are free” (Hardisty & Haaga, 2008,
p. 835). They conclude that “A more immediate practical implication of the present study
is that scholars wishing to maximize the diffusion of their research among the professional
community should deposit eprints of their work in OA archives” (p. 836).
If the evidence points to access as a positive benefit to practitioners, why is more access
not provided to practitioners via subscriptions? The cost barrier to academic journals is
high for individuals and agencies. Bowen and colleagues’ (2013) study of social work
journal subscription cost data found an average of $121 per subscription for an individual,
with much higher costs for institutions. The average yearly inflation rate for academic
journals tends to hover in the 5%-6% range, but the projected increase for social sciences
titles for 2017 was 7.2% (Bosch & Henderson, 2017). Bowen et al. (2013) reasonably assert
that “open access is particularly important when considering the needs of practitioners in
less wealthy organizations, communities, and institutions in the United States and
globally,” (p. 40) especially when promoting evidence-based practice.
Acknowledging that the high impact journals in the field of social work do not include
any open access titles, there is another key pathway for researchers to share their work:
institutional or disciplinary repositories. Institutional repositories are the most viable path
for stable, long term, and publicly/freely available sharing of research, outside of
publishing in an OA journal, and IRs are common at all major universities at this point. In
2017, there were 820 institutional repositories in the United States, Canada, and the United
Kingdom according to the Registry of Open Access Repositories. Disciplinary repositories,
such as SocArXiv, provide an open access platform for researchers to upload pre-prints
and working papers; repositories such as PubMed Central provide a platform for published
papers. Overall, social sciences disciplinary repositories are younger and smaller than those
in the hard sciences, but they have seen growth in their collections. PubMed Central and
its counterpart, Europe PMC, have grown significantly, assisted by being the recommended
depositories for health sciences research subject to public access policies.

Pendell/BEHIND THE WALL

1047

Many IRs are supported by the university library, with varying levels of promotion and
support for depositing content. The rate of self-archiving in 2010 United Kingdom was
34% for the social sciences broadly, and psychology more specifically (Van Noorden,
2012, p. 303). However, the United Kingdom also has more robust public access policies
in place than the United States. Overall though, the rate of self-archiving of research articles
by authors lags far behind its potential, especially when compared with the swift
enthusiasm a publication sharing platform such as ResearchGate appears to generate.

Method
In order to measure the level of public access to research articles in the field of social
work, citation searches were performed on a sample set of articles from the top 25 social
work related journals. Using the Eigenfactor metric of article influence for 2014, the top
25 journals in the International Scientific Indexing category of social work were identified
(see Table 1). Eigenfactor’s article influence score measures the average number of
citations to individual articles within a journal; this measure was selected as article level
access was the primary concern for this study. Ultimately, the bulk of the top 25 journal
titles with high article influence are the same as those ranked by overall journal influence.
I retrieved citations for articles published in 2014 from each of the journals using the
Social Sciences Index available via the Web of Science. As part of this process every
attempt was made to accurately exclude citations for editorials, book reviews, letters,
corrections, or other citations that were not recognizable as research articles. None of the
25 journals identified are open access; however, all of the journals allow for the deposit of
a pre-print or post-print version in an institutional or disciplinary repository. All but five
titles allow for paid open access of individual articles, as indicated by SHERPA/RoMEO,
an aggregator of journal OA policies (SHERPA/RoMEO, n.d.; see Table 1). The citation
sample set was derived from citations from 2014, allowing for an over two year gap to
account for the embargo period sometimes required by publishers prior to self-archiving in
a repository. From the total number of 1,587 research article citations retrieved from the
25 journals, a random sample of 638 citations created by a random generator for Google
Sheets was selected in accordance with a 95% confidence level with +/- 3 confidence
interval.
Each citation was searched using the Google Scholar and DOAI.io in an off-campus,
unauthenticated browser to avoid inaccurate access to full-text via IP recognition or
institutional affiliation. Google Scholar is a well-known discovery and access point for
scholarly journal articles; its search engine crawls academic publisher websites as well as
institutional and disciplinary repositories, such as PMC. Google Scholar also crawls
ResearchGate for full-text articles uploaded by its users. DOAI.io is the Digital Open
Access Identifier, which utilizes an article’s Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to retrieve free
access to a version of the article if available. Each citation was searched using both
applications because they demonstrate different access points for a given citation. Neither
of these discovery tools search full-text “pirate” sites such as SciHub; access to full-text
via those sites is not part of this study.

A pilot was performed with 20 citations, revealing that in addition to the planned
recording of availability of full-text from an institutional or disciplinary repository,
download availability of full-text via the social networking website ResearchGate should
also be noted. Therefore, the public availability, if any, of full-text (publisher PDF, postprint, or pre-print version) via a DOI search of Google Scholar and DOIA.io was recorded,

Findings and Discussion
As seen in Table 2, no full-text access was found for 52% of articles, a slim majority
of the total 638 citations investigated. The sample set of citations demonstrated only
minimal use of institutional repositories as a means of sharing research. Deposit of fulltext in the disciplinary repositories PMC and Europe PMC was higher than that of
institutional repositories, and likely can be attributed to funding agency or governmental
requirements, as discussed earlier. Within the parameters of this study, very few articles
would be available to users not affiliated with an institution or some other form of
subscription access without the popularity of ResearchGate, which accounted for 30% of
full-text access.

In regards to the high use of ResearchGate, it is likely that many articles uploaded to
the platform are in violation of publisher copyright agreements. In fact, mass take down
notices from publishers targeting ResearchGate have already begun (Van Noorden, 2017).
As Jamali (2017) notes, the number of recent articles on ResearchGate is “...not good for
publishers as journals’ main revenue relies on newly published issues and that is why a lot
of publishers apply embargo periods for archiving peer-reviewed versions of the articles”
(p.252). Jamali (2017) found over 78% of a random sample of 500 articles in ResearchGate
were publisher PDFs (p.251). This study’s results demonstrate an even higher rate of
deposit of publisher PDFs of the articles found in ResearchGate: 96% of articles on
ResearchGate were publisher’s PDF version.
Ascertaining the means by which these articles were uploaded to ResearchGate, or the
amount of them that are in violation of copyright is outside of the scope of this study.
However, the legal complications of ResearchGate are important for our understanding of
public access because this platform appears to be a primary means of access that would be
otherwise unavailable. “To understand the role of ResearchGate in making full-text of
papers freely available, it is enough to say that it is one of the top sources of full-text files
found through Google Scholar” (Jamali, 2017, p. 242). This will change quickly as
publishers take legal steps to limit the extent of copyright violations via ResearchGate (Van
Noorden, 2017). Here the distinctions between IRs and disciplinary repositories versus forprofit social network platforms becomes clearer: repositories are born with a different
purpose and ethos, and are managed with an eye towards copyright compliance and long
term access.

ADVANCES IN SOCIAL WORK, Fall 2018, 18(4)

1050

As a simple tracking of full-text availability, this study does not answer the question
of why engagement in self-archiving is low. For example, the availability of institutional
repositories to authors in the sample set and the amount of support offered by the institution
is unknown. Authors may struggle with self-archiving in repositories due to the “time and
effort involved in determining or securing copyright” (Palmer, Teffeau, & Newton, 2008,
p. 25). Or perhaps the low rate of deposit is due to lack of awareness and education
regarding the purpose and utilization of OA, IRs, and disciplinary repositories. Further
research related to both the researcher/author perspective and the practitioner/user
perspectives is needed. It would be valuable to have a better understanding of whether
researchers perceive the impact of their work primarily as citations from other researchers
or for use by practitioners in the field. The level of awareness and understanding of options
for sharing research among authors are also of interest.
Looking at practitioners/users, to what extent do they use, or wish to use, research
articles to inform their practice? Are the aforementioned pirate sites or other avenues (e.g.
#canihazpdf on Twitter) providing viable work-around access for savvy social workers?
And for social work librarians, we must ask if teaching students to use expensive, licensed
databases that lead to subscription-based full-text platforms is effective for students once
they separate from the university. Would it be helpful to discuss the economics of scholarly
communication to increase understanding of how access is available or not available?
Additional research on topics like these, building upon this study, has the potential to
inform us how researchers/authors think of dissemination of their work; how students are
taught to find and access research; how access shapes decision-making in the field; and
how it influences OA-related advocacy efforts in social work.

Conclusion
The findings of this study establish a baseline measure of research article availability
to practitioners and the public, assuming no personal and institutional subscriptions to
individual journal titles. A significant amount of research published in core social work
journals is not available to the practitioners or members of the public who would benefit
from it. This is especially of concern as public skepticism of academia and scientific
research increases. It is time for researchers, administrators, publishers, and librarians in
the field of social work to increase openness and access to research. Looking ahead, there
are two immediate ways for researchers to move their scholarship from behind the
publisher paywall: publish in an OA journal whenever possible and practice self-archiving
in either an institutional or disciplinary repository. Many will likely have the support of
their university library in these efforts. Clearly, there is at least some interest in sharing
scholarship as demonstrated by the use of ResearchGate, but as noted, there are caveats to
such platforms. Librarians have a role in educating both researchers and students about the
differing models of scholarly publishing, author’s rights, and public access indexing tools
and OA full-text sources. A longer term recommendation for researchers and
administrators in an academic settings to consider is rewarding OA publishing and/or
repository archiving as a reflection of community engagement in processes such as
promotion and tenure. In addition to the societal benefits of OA publishing, a majority of
comparison studies have indicated that OA publishing also benefits authors by increasing

Pendell/BEHIND THE WALL

1051

citations to their articles versus non-OA published articles (Tennant et al., 2016). Gold and
green OA come with their own concerns and complications to be sorted out. However, the
status quo of keeping research behind publisher paywalls costs the field of social work in
ways that should not remain unexamined.
