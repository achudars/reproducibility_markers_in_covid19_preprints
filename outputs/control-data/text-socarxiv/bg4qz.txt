Abstract
Scientific research on academic collaboration focuses on co-authorships, citations and
acknowledgements as ‘reward triangle’. However, acknowledgements have received
comparatively little attention. In this paper, we compare co-authorship and
acknowledgement networks and investigate conditions that influence their formation
(gender, institutional affiliation and status of authors and acknowledged
individuals). We select three sub-disciplinary political science journals from
Germany between 2010 and 2017. We employ techniques from social network
analysis to compare these conditions by using homophily measures. The results
demonstrate that co-authorships have a rather sparse network while including
acknowledgements reveals hidden collaboration structures. Moreover, scholars from
the same institution are more likely to co-author and acknowledge each other while
we show heterophily effects for acknowledging and co-authoring behavior of
professors. We also identify an underrepresentation of female academics as authors
and credit-givers alike. Thus, our exploratory study reveals similarities and
differences patterns for co-authorships and acknowledgements providing new
ground for future studies on all aspects of collaborative behavior in science.

Introduction
Co-authorships, citations and acknowledgements may be considered the three
currencies of scientific research and are theorized as ‘reward triangle’ (Costas &
Leeuwen, 2012; Cronin & Weaver, 1995; Desrochers et al., 2018). While much
research has focused on co-authorships and citations as well as its interrelation (A.
Díaz-Faes

&

Bordons,

2017;

Costas

&

Leeuwen,

2012;

Cronin,

2001),

acknowledgements have gathered relatively less attention. Yet, scholars have argued
that acknowledgements can be understood as ‘super-citation’, ‘courtesy’, ‘gift’ or
‘symbolic capital’ in academia (Cronin & Overfelt, 1994; Desrochers et al., 2018; Edge,
1979; McCain, 1991). Acknowledgements reveal rather informal social interactions
and represent parts of the personal context of scholars (Hyland, 2003).
Cronin and Weaver (1995, p. 175) claim that studies are necessary that analyze
‘issues of equity in terms of how rewards are distributed, e.g. co-authorship versus
acknowledgements’. Since then only few studies have investigated both coauthorship and acknowledgement (Costas & Leeuwen, 2012; Paul-Hus, Mongeon,
Sainte-Marie, & Larivière, 2017). Previous work on acknowledgements gave a
descriptive overview about the state of acknowledgments in different disciplines,
demonstrating that almost all scientific disciplines share the act of credit giving and
that this behavior increases since decades (Cronin, McKenzie, & Rubio, 1993; Giles &
Councill, 2004; Salager-Meyer, Alcaraz-Ariza, Luzardo Briceño, & Jabbour, 2011).
In this paper, we are particularly interested in acknowledgements to single
persons or what Cronin and colleagues call ‘peer interaction communication’ (PIC)

2

(Cronin et al., 1993), because these are crucial to identify scientific and intellectual
‘debt’ to others (Costas & Leeuwen, 2012; Giles & Councill, 2004; Paul-Hus, DíazFaes, et al., 2017). While quantitative information is available for various disciplines
(Cronin, Shaw, & La Barre, 2003; Heffner, 1981; Hyland, 2003; McCain, 1991; SalagerMeyer

et

al.,

2011),

a

comparative

study

of

conditions

that

influence

acknowledgements and co-authorship has not been taken up. Thus, we build upon
previous

work

and

investigate

under

which

conditions

co-authorship

and

acknowledgement form similar or different patterns.
Based on former contributions on co-authored collaboration we consider gender,
institutional affiliation and academic status of scholars as relevant conditions. While
homophily effects have been observed for co-authorship (Leifeld, Wankmüller,
Berger, Ingold, & Steiner, 2017; Teele & Thelen, 2017; West, Jacquet, King, Correll, &
Bergstrom, 2013), we do not know the mechanism at work when it comes to
acknowledgements. Our basic assumption is that similar mechanisms evoke coauthorship and acknowledgements.
We apply techniques from social network analysis (Wasserman & Faust, 1994) to
examine the conditions that affect collaboration and acknowledgment patterns in an
explorative way. Constructing multiplex co-authorship and acknowledgement
networks allows us to investigate homophily concerning gender, affiliation and
status. While homophily is one of the most investigated features in social networks
(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001), it is only rarely applied to co-authorships
and even less to acknowledgements.

3

To investigate both co-authorship and acknowledgement relations, and, at the
same time, account for disciplinary differences (Leahey, 2006; Leahey & Moody,
2014; Rawlings, McFarland, Dahlander, & Wang, 2015), three sub-disciplinary
political science journals from Germany are selected, the Zeitschrift für Internationale
Beziehungen (Journal of International Relations, ZIB), the Zeitschrift für Vergleichende
Politikwissenschaft (Comparative Governance and Politics, ZfVP) and the Zeitschrift
für Politische Theorie (Journal of Political Theory, ZPTH). The journals are relatively
new, but have a good reputation in the related German political science profession.
Moreover, comparative politics, international relations and political theory seem to
be on opposite sides of collaboration patterns in political science. While comparative
politics scholars show a stronger pattern of collaboration, political theorists seem to
publish predominantly single authored articles; international relations scholars are in
between this spectrum (Leifeld & Ingold, 2016; Metz & Jäckle, 2017). In order to
study the formation and conditions of co-authorship and acknowledgements in the
three journals, all issues are analyzed from 2010 to 2017 and the relevant information
about authors and acknowledged persons had to be collected manually. We
concentrate on sub-disciplinary differences within the field of political science rather
than on further similarities to maximize information contained in the limited dataset.
The article is structured as follows: The next section discusses and situates our
study in the literature on acknowledgements and co-authorship. Furthermore, we
present our hypotheses on status, institutional affiliation and gender differences in
academic collaborations. The research design then describes data collection and

4

material as well as the social network analysis techniques. The fourth section
presents and interprets the findings. The final section concludes the study, discusses
its limitations and gives an outlook on future studies.

Collaboration types in academia
Previous research suggests that collaboration leads to increased productivity and is
understood as necessary for successful research and relevant for receiving funding
(Heinze, Heidler, Heiberger, & Riebling, 2013; Iglič, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj,
2017; Katz & Martin, 1997; Melin & Persson, 1996; Tsai, Corley, & Bozeman, 2016;
Wray, 2002). Researchers perceive publishing together easier, because they can
exchange ideas and get feedback within teams more quickly than as single author
(Gordon, 1980; Lewis, Ross, & Holden, 2012; Metz & Jäckle, 2017; Tsai et al., 2016).
Even though collaboration as concept is difficult to define and includes several
layers (Katz & Martin, 1997), many studies investigate it as visible cooperation between
at least two researchers who co-author a published text (report, article, book etc.). In
this regard, scholars show the increase of research collaboration across academic
disciplines and countries (Cronin et al., 2003; Leifeld & Ingold, 2016; Leifeld et al.,
2017; Melin & Persson, 1996; O’Brien, 2012; Ossenblok, Verleysen, & Engels, 2014).
Moreover, they demonstrate that empirical research is far more team-based than
theoretical work (Fisher, Cobane, Ven, & Cullen, 1998; Leifeld & Ingold, 2016; Metz &
Jäckle, 2017; Moody, 2004; Smith, 1958). Single-authored texts might matter in terms
of merits and reputation in the respective field, because as single-author, you do not
have to share the recognition for your work (Lewis et al., 2012, pp. 699–700; Metz &

5

Jäckle, 2017). Collaboration in the humanities and social science is perceived as extrawork and more difficult than working as sole investigator (Farber, 2005; Lewis et al.,
2012). Accordingly, we differentiate political science into sub-disciplinary schools of
thought to account for potential differences with regard to collaboration patterns.
Invisible collaboration plays also an important part in academia in the form of
ideational exchange, informal talks and feedback (Heffner, 1981; Plummer, Newman,
& Winter, 1993; Subramanyam, 1983). These forms of collaboration are often
neglected in bibliometric studies. As Subramanyam (1983, p. 35) argues: ’a brilliant
suggestion made by a scientist during casual conversation may be more valuable in
shaping the course and outcome of a research project than weeks of labor-intensive
activity of a collaborating scientist in the laboratory’. In a recent review article,
Leahey (2016, p. 82) concludes that ‘collaboration is more varied, and possibly more
common, than the coauthor measures based on bibliometric data sources suggest’.
Accordingly, other scholars argued that acknowledgements are a crucial indicator
to study indirect forms of collaboration, because they provide insights into
information exchange and communication processes. As Paul-Hus et al. (2017, p. 11)
point out: ‘They shed light on otherwise invisible contributions that complement
authorship and provide insight on researchers' collaboration patterns, division of
labor, and credit attribution practices.’ This intentional act to show gratitude to other
scholars is also a voluntary act that cannot be enforced by journals or publishers, and
provide no direct benefits. Cronin and colleagues argue that acknowledgements are
‘sub-author collaboration’ (Cronin et al., 2003; Cronin & Weaver, 1995).

6

While such a characteristic might be true in sciences in which many researchers
respectively research teams are involved, social science does not experience such
large publications teams as emerging norm that might qualify acknowledgments as
‘sub-authors’. Therefore, understanding acknowledgements as courtesy seems more
valid (Cronin & Overfelt, 1994; McCain, 1991). Most of the researchers know about
this ‘institutionalised practice’ (Cronin et al., 1993, p. 37) of giving credit to others in
a

publication.

As

studies

showed,

scholars

look

specifically

for

such

acknowledgements and have an expectation to get acknowledged if they know that
they have exchanged ideas with the author(s) (Cronin & Overfelt, 1994).
Understanding acknowledgements as collaborative actions of the peers also shows
that the divide between team-based and single author publications might not be as
pronounced as often claimed (Paul-Hus, Mongeon, et al., 2017). However, such a
culture of acknowledgements is more established in U.S. academia than in other
countries (Costas & Leeuwen, 2012; Salager-Meyer et al., 2011).
Scholars have suggested to look at different types of acknowledgements and
studies have shown crucial differences between these types (Cronin et al., 1993;
McCain, 1991). Moreover, funding acknowledgements and the number of citations of
research articles are investigated, but do not show a clear correlation (Costas &
Leeuwen, 2012; Giles & Councill, 2004). We focus on peer interactive communication,
understood as ‘a record of, presumably significant, intellectual input and influence
received from one's peers. The registering of this influence, or intellectual debt, via
acknowledgement is comparable with the registering of influence via citations.’

7

(Cronin et al., 1993, p. 31). We do this for two reasons. Firstly, our aim is to compare
co-authorship and acknowledgement relations and, hence, individual researchers as
co-authors and acknowledged persons are of interest. Funding agencies or specific
events

are

not

considered

in

our

study.

Secondly,

while

differentiating

acknowledgements into different sub-types such as moral, financial or technical
support (Cronin et al., 1993, p. 31) would have added interesting information, it does
not enrich our comparison with co-authorship patterns. Thus, we solely focus on the
simple mentions of individuals in the dedicated section of the research article and
consider them as informal tie in a network of scholars. By comparing individuals, we
can also analyze who are the most central scholars in the respective network and
whether this is based on their co-authorship, acknowledgements or both relations.
The authors and acknowledged persons are then further characterized by their
gender, institutional affiliation and status to investigate effects of homophily.

Gender, institutional affiliation and status in academic collaborations
Three aspects of academic collaboration have been predominantly investigated:
gender, institutional affiliation and status. Studies on the gender dimension of
academic collaboration show that women are not as well connected and collaborate
less than their male peers in specific areas such as methodological issues (Barnes &
Beaulieu, 2017; Dehdarirad, Villarroya, & Barrios, 2014; Hancock, Baum, & Breuning,
2013). 'Only-women'-contributors are especially rare in high-ranked journals
compared to 'only-men'-authors and male academics tend to publish more singleauthored articles than women (Fisher et al., 1998; Leahey, 2006; Teele & Thelen, 2017;

8

West et al., 2013). Moreover, the majority of female scholars is still working in
disciplines in which they are the majority. However, more women are involved in
interdisciplinary research collaboration as men (Teele & Thelen, 2017; van Rijnsoever
& Hessels, 2011; West et al., 2013).
So far, gender differences have not been investigated in studies on
acknowledgements.

Nonetheless,

considering

the

findings

on

the

most

acknowledged persons in various disciplines (Cronin, 2001; Cronin et al., 1993; Giles
& Councill, 2004), most of the mentioned scholars are male. However, this finding is
only based on the presented results in the respective studies and has to be qualified
in regard to its dyadic consequences. Hence, we derive two hypotheses:
H1a: We expect that more male than female academics are named in the
acknowledgements.
H1b: We expect strong effects of gender homophily, i.e., females acknowledge other females,
males other males.
In addition to gender, institutional affiliation affects collaboration. Previous
studies show two different trends. On the one hand, scholars argue that
internationalization and digitalization of academic research offers the opportunity to
cooperate and communicate with colleagues easier, faster and in a more productive
way than in past decades (Hunter & Leahey, 2008). Moreover, rather small or
specialized fields tend to collaborate across national boundaries, because the
'epistemic community' in the own national community is rather limited (Iglič et al.,
2017).

9

On the other hand, scholars argue that researcher tend to cooperate mainly at the
same institute. The initial contact and exchange of ideas is perceived as easier and
applying for funding is more effective if the researchers are based at the same
university (Correia, Paredes, & Fonseca, 2018; Ferligoj, Kronegger, Mali, Snijders, &
Doreian, 2015; Iglič et al., 2017; Kronegger, Mali, Ferligoj, & Doreian, 2012). More
specifically, recent studies demonstrate that geographical proximity increases the
likelihood of collaboration research (Heiberger & Riebling, 2015; Leifeld & Ingold,
2016; Leifeld et al., 2017).1 Therefore, our second hypothesis is as following:
H2. We expect that acknowledgments tend to occur more often between members of the
same institution.
The third aspect refers to the status of an academic, whether the researcher is a
PhD student or a professor. Either researchers on the same status cooperate or it is a
hierarchical cooperation.2 The first collaboration might occur among Post-Docs and
professors who work on similar topics and put their strength and interests together.
While Post-Docs try to improve their reputation, demonstrate that they can work
with others and on different subjects, collaboration among professors might be
differently motivated. Professors build on 'ties that last' (Rawlings et al., 2015) with
regard to former collaboration projects, counting on their existing reputation and
multifold connections within the research community.

Giles and Councill (2004, p. 17603) point towards the relevance of institutional affiliations for acknowledgments,
but they do not investigate this relation more closely.
2 Calling it a hierarchical collaboration does not necessarily mean a negative power-exploiting cooperation. The
term has no normative connotation in the present study.

We assume similar relations and homophily by status for acknowledgements.
Scholars present their work to peers on conferences and workshops, but also discuss
their research with colleagues in the institute or working group. Researchers on the
same status level are mentioned because it is an equal exchange relation between
peers. Yet, we assume the mechanism of homophily to prevail:
H3. We expect that researcher name other researchers with the same status in their
acknowledgements, i.e., homophile relations with regard to status.
However, it is also feasible that collaborating as well as giving advice and
providing help might be heterophile in status. The PhD student or Post-Doc wants to
publish an article and either s/he asks the supervisor if they want to work together or
the supervisor initiates it and argues for a co-authored article with his/her PhD
student(s) or Post-Docs (Subramanyam, 1983). In particular, graduate students as
well as Post-Docs have close relationships with their mentors in the German
academic world, in which patronage is an important way to receive and grant
promotions (Münch, 2001). This behavior could also be exhibited when it comes to
acknowledgements. A professor might comment an earlier draft of the paper by
his/her

doctoral

students

or

Post-Docs

resulting

in

a

mention

in

the

acknowledgement section of the paper.
Summarizing our expectations, we investigate how gender, institutional affiliation
and status influence acknowledgements and co-authorship. Based on previous work,
we expect similar homophile effects for all three factors, namely that similarity in

11

gender, institutional affiliation and status positively affects the chance to be coauthor
or being acknowledged.

Case selection and data material
We have selected three sub-disciplinary political science journals for the analysis of
collaboration patterns. This has two advantages in comparison to studies on single
countries or general-interest journals. Firstly, we expect a close linkage in the
respective journal network. All texts are targeted for a specific audience and engage
in topics which are relevant for the discussion in the field. Sub-disciplinary journals
might show a stronger overlap of author and acknowledgement links than generalinterest journals. In contrast, journals of general interests cover many different issues
and encompass various sub-disciplines (Arzheimer & Schoen, 2009; Fisher et al.,
1998). Secondly, the analysis of country collaborations bears the tendency of
'methodological nationalism' (Wimmer & Glick Schiller, 2002). This means that only
publications were considered for the analysis that were (co-)authored within the
national community (Cancela, Coelho, & Ruivo, 2014; Kronegger et al., 2012; Leifeld
& Ingold, 2016; Leifeld et al., 2017). Our selection of three sub-disciplinary journals
can transcend these methodological concerns.
Most often, top-ranked journals of academic fields are analyzed (Fisher et al., 1998;
Metz & Jäckle, 2017; Teele & Thelen, 2017). However, the emphasis on high-ranked
journals might show a biased representation of collaboration patterns. Many
researchers try to publish in these journals, but might end up in lower ranked
journal. Thus, looking at journals with lower impact factors and less perceived

12

prestige might demonstrate different collaboration patterns and the present study
fills this gap.3 The Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB), the Zeitschrift für
Vergleichende Politikwissenschaft (ZfVP) and the Zeitschrift für Politische Theorie (ZPTH)
are based in Germany and publish mainly German texts, although the option to
publish in English is available (and used by authors).
The journals ZfVP, ZIB and ZPTH are selected according to three aspects: Firstly,
they are sub-disciplinary journals in German political science and their target group
in terms of authors and audience is focused on comparative politics, international
relations or political theory. The selected sub-disciplines seem to be on the opposite
side of collaboration patterns in political science. Comparative politics shows a
stronger pattern of collaboration and seems closer to natural science collaboration
patterns than political theorists who tend more towards the arts and humanities
discipline. International relations might be placed in the middle between these two
poles (A. Díaz-Faes & Bordons, 2017; Leifeld & Ingold, 2016; Leifeld et al., 2017; Metz
& Jäckle, 2017). Secondly, the analysis of collaboration patterns in political science has
gained attention in the last decade and this is especially true for the German case
(Arzheimer & Schoen, 2009; Cancela et al., 2014; Leifeld & Ingold, 2016; Leifeld et al.,
2017; Metz & Jäckle, 2017; Pehl, 2012; Teele & Thelen, 2017). The study sheds light on
the German political science community which is strongly influenced by the English-

The strong emphasis in the empirical research on co-authorship in high-ranked journals might hide other
publication patterns and should be treated cautiously in terms of result generalizability. The suggested focus on
lower-ranked journals does not argue that focusing on these is in any way 'better'.

speaking scholarly community and we can assess whether cultural differences are
relevant for acknowledgment patterns as Salager-Meyer et al. (2011) demonstrate.
Thirdly, the journals are linked to the respective sections and working groups in
the German Political Science Association (DVPW, 2019). Thus, they are the main
communicators of such research in German political science and read by the peers.
Publishing in one of these can be seen as an important step towards visibility within
the sub-disciplinary (national) scientific community.
The ZIB is published since 1994 and is the leading academic journal on
international relations in Germany. Furthermore, it was the first German political
science journal with a double blind peer review process. The ZIB is published twice a
year, includes thematic forums and does not publish single book reviews.
The ZfVP is edited since 2007 and with its explicit focus on comparative politics, it
is the leading German journal in this field. It publishes research articles, book
reviews, conference reports and interviews. From 2007 to 2012, it has published two
issues per year and after that, it changed to four issues per year. Research articles go
through a double blind peer review process.4
The ZPTH is edited since 2010 and even though it is a rather new journal, it is also
unique for the sub-discipline political theory in Germany. It publishes two issues
each year and contains research articles, book reviews, conference reports and other
texts such as interviews. From time to time and within a regular journal issue, a

The ZfVP also publishes special issues, but these are excluded, because for those, specific call for
papers are published and specific scholars are invited to publish.

thematic section with 4-5 related articles is published. All research articles are
published after a double blind peer review process.
For our analysis, all texts are selected which have been published in the regular
issues of the three journals between 2010 and 2017. Creating a rather similar dataset
for the three journals increases the comparability of the collaboration patterns. The
data collection was partially done manually and partially done by scrapping the
respective information from the publisher websites with the R package rvest
(Wickham, 2016).
While the author’s information (gender based on first name, status, institutional
affiliation) are provided by the journals, the acknowledgements from the respective
section were retrieved manually. Other information on funding or conference
participation have been deleted and only the names of the individual have been
extracted. After that, the data was cleaned and, if necessary, corrected manually. In
the next step, every characteristic of the acknowledged persons had to be identified
manually by comparing the authors dataset with the acknowledgement dataset and
when information on acknowledged persons were missing or non-existing, they had
to be identified by individual web searches.5 An automatization of retrieving
acknowledgements, as Giles and Councill (2004) deployed or a large data extraction

In few cases, some of the characteristics of the author were not provided in the article and could not be
identified later. The gender of the author was attributed by using the authors’ first name as indicator. We are
aware that this is problematic, because it might reify social and cultural understandings of female and male first
names. If the institutional affiliation and the status of the authors were not reported in the text, the information
was indicated as 'n/a' in the dataset due to the difficulty to clearly determine the status and affiliation of the
author at the time of the published article. Moreover, some authors had no institutional affiliation and only
named the city of living. Again, the information was coded as 'n/a' in the dataset. This challenge in the data
collection and completeness is discussed in the conclusion.

from the web of science applied in other studies (A. Díaz-Faes & Bordons, 2017;
Costas & Leeuwen, 2012; Paul-Hus, Díaz-Faes, et al., 2017) was not possible and
would have not provided the relevant information for our study. The labor-intense
information gathering creates a unique dataset of acknowledged persons, authors
and their attributes which are, so far, not provided by Scopus or Web of Science.

Social network analysis
Social network analysis focuses on the relations of actors and investigates the
structural components of social actions (Kadushin, 2012; Wasserman & Faust, 1994).
To apply social network analysis to our study, author names, status and institutional
affiliations have been collected manually from the journal articles as well as the
information on the acknowledged individuals.6 In our case, social networks consist of
two sorts of ties. The first is the widely investigated structure of co-authorships with
which we will compare our main research aim, acknowledgements of scholars.
Co-authored collaboration is understood as undirected ties between at least two
academics while acknowledgement links are conceptualized as directed ties. If
researcher A and B have published a text together, a "1" is put into the respective
column and row in the adjacency matrix; if there is no joint publication, “0” is put in.
If A mentions B in the acknowledgement, the direction is conceptualized from A to B.
If researcher A and B have published a text together and also mentioned each other
in the acknowledgements, the two different ties are noted separately, i.e. they are
reciprocal.
The personal attributes of the acknowledged individuals can only be assigned with high certainty because we
look at rather small sub-disciplines.
6

16

Studies on scientific collaboration often investigate the centrality of academics in
collaboration networks. Since we are interested whether acknowledgement ties
resemble co-authorship ties and whether the dominant authors and acknowledged
person have similar or different characteristics, we calculate each scholars’ “degree
centrality”. (Freeman, 1978; Wasserman & Faust, 1994). Weighted degree centrality is
the number of all relations between two authors. If two authors’ collaboration
resulted in 3 papers, they would have, for instance, a weighted degree of 3 (Opsahl,
Agneessens, & Skvoretz, 2010). Because acknowledgements are directed relations
and we are interested in scholar’s influence, we only consider being acknowledged
(i.e., weighted indegree). Having a high degree centrality indicates a crucial position
of a researcher in the academic network, because the researcher publishes many coauthored papers in the selected journals, is acknowledged many times or both
aspects match.
In addition to the (descriptive) investigation of centrality of scholars, we focus on
the influence of personal attributes (gender, affiliation, status) on tie formations. In
other words, we assume homophily of these attributes (McPherson et al., 2001).7
Mark Newman (2003) developed an indicator to reveal potential homophily in social
networks. Assortativity is the correlation between certain properties of nodes, for
instance, Merton’s Matthew effect (Merton, 1968) might be framed as high degree
assortativity in networks, i.e. that nodes with high degrees tend to have strong ties

To measure homophily, most often Exponential Random Graph Models are employed. However, the
acknowledgement networks are too sparse for conversion of the ERGMs. We have been only able to obtain very
specific ERGMs and refrained from using those. The results of the ERGMs may be requested from the authors.

with other nodes with many relations. In this paper, we investigate assortativity in
respect to the personal attributes indicating whether the acknowledgement and coauthorship networks in the three journals are structured by homophily effects.8

Formal and informal networks in German Political science
Structure
The three journals have published 16 (2 issues per year in the ZIB and ZPTH)
respectively 23 issues (ZfVP) between 2010 and 2017.9 303 texts could be obtained
from the ZfVP, 183 from the ZPTH and 127 from the ZIB. From this sample of texts,
the ZIB has the highest share of research articles (87 per cent), followed by ZPTH (44
per cent) and the ZfVP (29 per cent). The ZfVP publishes many book reviews which
lowers the percentage of research articles. Conference reports, Editorials and other
texts account for a minority of published texts in the three journals. The vast majority
of the acknowledgements appear in research articles which corroborates previous
findings in other disciplines (Cronin et al., 1993; Salager-Meyer et al., 2011).
Our dataset is relatively small in comparison to other studies (Costas & Leeuwen,
2012; Cronin et al., 1993; Giles & Councill, 2004; Paul-Hus, Díaz-Faes, et al., 2017,
2017). This is due to the additional identification of personal information on the
authors and acknowledged persons which we collected manually. Without those
information, our central aim to reveal and compare conditions of collaboration,
would not be achieved. However, given the limited sample size the following results
give an explorative insight into co-authorship and acknowledgment patterns.

9

We use the R package “igraph” (Csárdi & Nepusz, 2006) to compute and visualize all collaboration patterns.
The ZfVP has published three double issues (3/4, 2014; 1/2, 2015 and 3/4, 2016), each counted as one.

The first step of our analysis comprises the visualization of the co-authorship and
acknowledgement ties between authors, differentiated by journal.10 Differentiation
and visualization give us a first glance on how the acknowledgements are distributed
and spread across the scholars’ network. In addition, the visualization reveals how
similar or different both types of ties are among the journals in question. Therefore,
we show a multiplex network for each journal, i.e., networks containing both
relationships. While the red ties show the acknowledgements (from the author to the
credited person), the black ties show the co-authorship links. The size of the nodes is
based on weighted degree centrality, indicating how well a scholar is connected to
other scholars in the field via co-authorship and acknowledgements.

Figure 1-3. Visualization of co-authorship and acknowledgement networks

Each of the three networks demonstrate that co-authorships and acknowledgements
overlap for some authors. More interestingly, Figures 1 to 3 also reveal differing
collaboration patterns. Acknowledgement connects bigger groups and links

networks in table 1A in the online appendix.

otherwise isolated researchers with scholars who are more central in the field. Hence,
we demonstrate that single-authored papers are also situated in research
communities and support networks by visualizing the acknowledgement links.
The visualization of the multiplex networks also shows who the most central scholars
in each journal are. Table 1 provides a numeric overview about the highest ranked
scholars in the respective journal, based on weighted in-degree and degree centrality.

Table 1 demonstrates that taking acknowledgements into account strongly affects the
network structure in each journal. Many scholars have a central position in one of
each network, so they are either a central collaboration partner or many times
acknowledged.

Rank-correlating

the

centrality

in

co-authorship

and

acknowledgement networks reveals values of -0.05 (ZIB), 0.11 (ZfVP), and -0.34
(ZPTh), all representing insignificant correlations. Thus, rank correlation resembles
stark differences between both networks.
To be sure, the network structure of the three journals differs too, which leads to
different interpretations why the specific scholars are the most central ones.11 The ZIB
network structure is rather dense, because there is an encompassing main component
which connects most of the scholars in the journal. There are scholars such as
Deitelhoff, Diez and Niesen who have a high in-degree, because they are often
acknowledged while Geis' or Zürns’ centrality is based on a mixture of co-authored
articles and acknowledgment relations. Scholars such as Renner or Zimmermann coauthor articles in the ZIB, but are rarely acknowledged in other journal articles.
While the first mentioned scholars are professors, the last two scholars are post
doctoral researcher. We further explore this status difference in the next section of
the article.
The strong increase of the number of scholars from co-author links to including
acknowledgement links (see Table 1A in the online appendix) indicates that the
German international relations community is well connected, works on similar issues

and creates an epistemic community. German IR scholars seek feedback and
comments within the German community. Moreover, since the ZIB is the oldest
journal of these three sub-disciplinary journals and related to the thematic section in
the German Political Science Association, publishing in the ZIB might be an
important academic career step in the German IR community. The German IR
community is highly internationalized and strongly linked to the English speaking
community in Europe and the US (Wemheuer-Vogelaar & Risse, 2018) which might
explain the co-authorship and acknowledgements behavior (see also next section).
In the ZfVP, Mohamad-Klotzbach, Kailitz and Gert Pickel have co-authored articles in
the ZfVP and are acknowledged and thus, they become rather central. In contrast to
the German IR field, comparative politics seems to rest on a few central academics
who co-author articles and are acknowledgement in ZfVP articles. Moreover, the
total number of acknowledged persons as well as the concrete number of
acknowledgements to individuals is smaller than in the ZIB. This might indicate a
greater diversity in terms of research topics as well as collaboration strategies.
Different research strands might be represented in the journal that are partially
linked by these central figures, but not as densely as in the German IR journal. The
difference in the number of acknowledgements might also indicate a different
'acknowledgement culture' than in the ZIB. Moreover, Kneuer and Gert Pickel are
member of the editorial board of the ZfVP and Mohamad-Klotzbach is the respective
editorial assistant and this might explain their central position in the journal

23

network. As in the ZIB network, the majority of the most often acknowledged
scholars in the ZfVP are professors.
The last journal network (ZPTH) is rather sparse. There exists a main component but
it is rather loosely connected and is predominately based on acknowledgment
relations. While Ladwigs centrality is solely based on mentions in other scholars
acknowledgments, the other scholars co-authored articles and are acknowledged by
others. We can assess that acknowledgements emphasize otherwise hidden
structures of the collaboration networks, but this is also related to the small network
and different epistemological stances in the subfield.
Even though, peer-reviewed journal articles increased their relevance in German
political theory, studies demonstrate that single authored papers and monographs
are still the main drivers for reputational gains and career steps in German political
theory (Diehl, 2015). Thus, collaboration might not only be seen as epistemologically
difficult to realize, but also as less-rewarded and acknowledged than single authored
publications. The rather weak 'acknowledgement culture' in the ZPTH in comparison
to the English-speaking academic context might be another explanation for these
findings. Additionally, the ZPTH is the youngest selected journal and therefore,
might suffer from a weaker reputation and recognition in the field than the other two
selected journals.
Despite these differences in the network structure, the three journals share the
underrepresentation of female scholars among the highest rank researchers (only 23
% of all 48 scholars in Table 1 are female). Most visibly is this in the political theory

24

journal (ZPTH) with no women being present and in the comparative politics journal
(ZfVP) in which one of 14 scholars is a woman. In contrast the international relations
journal (ZIB) has a representation quota of 34 per cent of all high ranked scholars are
being female. Thus, hypothesis H1a on the underrepresentation of female scholars
can be confirmed.
Comparing homophily patterns
To investigate homophily we apply the idea of assortativity to 'gender' (H1a, 1b),
'institutional affiliation' (H2) and 'status' (H3). A high value of assortativity indicates
homophily within the respective category (e.g. women tend to publish with women)
while a higher negative value suggests that scholars do not work or acknowledge
others with the same gender or status (e.g. PhD students tend to give credit to nonPhD students in their acknowledgements).

25

Figure 4. Assortativity by gender and institutional affiliation

With regard to gender (H1b), acknowledgements tend to be given to scholars with
the same gender in each journal. While this likelihood is high in the comparative
politics journal (ZfVP), the likelihood is moderate in the political theory journal
(ZPTH) and slightly negative in the international relations journal (ZIB). While coauthorship shows a similar homophily pattern for the ZfVP and ZIB, the ZPTH
shows a high tendency toward heterophily among co-authors. Hence, it is rather
likely that the co-authors of political theory articles in the ZPTH have a different

26

gender. Hence, the homophily effect for co-authorship in the political theory journal
is not supported.
The category 'institutional affiliation' of authors and credit-giving persons shows a
strong tendency of homophile ties in all three journals (H2) and therefore, it is more
likely that academics co-author or acknowledge scholars from the same institution.
The assortativity value is very high in the ZfVP for both types of ties
(acknowledgement and co-authorship) and rather high in the ZIB. For both journals,
the value is higher for co-authorship ties than for acknowledgement links. The
investigation of the acknowledgement network in ZPTH shows mixed findings.
While acknowledgments seem to be given by colleagues in the same institution, the
co-authorship relation is minor negative.

27

Figure 5. Assortativity by status

The last of our three categories is 'status' and refers to whether an author or creditgiver is professor, postdoc or doctoral student (H3).12 We find a tendency towards
homophile scholarly relations in the ZfVP with regard to acknowledgements and coauthorship in each status group. Despite of the status, academics tend to publish
more with their status peers (Doc-Doc, PostDoc-PostDoc, Prof-Prof) and also

We also coded the statuses 'student' and 'unclear' but due to the small number of cases, we omitted these for the
analysis.

acknowledge those scholars who have the same status (H3). As Figure 5
demonstrates, this is especially the case for doctoral students who have a higher
likelihood of acknowledging and publishing with other doctoral students.
The international relations journal (ZIB) has a similar pattern of homophile relations
of credit-giving and co-authorship in the doctoral and post-doctoral status group.
However, professors tend towards heterophilious relations. They seem to publish
with other status groups and also tend to acknowledge scholars who have a different
status more often than peers with the same professorial status.
The comparative politics journal (ZfVP) shows homophily effects on the doctoral and
post-doctoral level in both modes of collaboration (acknowledgements and coauthorship). On the professor status, the homophily effect can be demonstrated with
regard to acknowledgement, but shows a minimal heterphilious effect with regard to
co-authorship.
The ZPTH shows more dissimilarity along the acknowledgement and co-authorship
distinction. While authors in the political theory journal tend to co-author articles
with peers in the same status groups (homophile relations), the negative assortativity
values in the postdoc and professor status group indicate that acknowledgement are
given to scholars with a different status then the author(s). Especially in the professor
status, this heterophilious relation is rather strong. Hence, our expected homophily
pattern for co-authorship and acknowledgements regarding researchers’ status is
mostly not corroborated.

29

Conclusion
The paper compares co-authorships and acknowledgements and investigate the
conditions under which these are similar or different. While co-authorship patterns
are widely recognized in research on science’s inner-workings and also
acknowledgements gain increasing attention in bibliometric studies (Cronin et al.,
2003; Desrochers et al., 2018; Paul-Hus, Mongeon, et al., 2017), the conditions that
explain similarities as well as differences between those have not been investigated
before.
Co-authorship relations as well as acknowledgements are understood as parts of
the ‘reward triangle’ (Costas & Leeuwen, 2012; Cronin & Weaver, 1995) and studied
in a comparative manner with regard to scholars’ attributes of gender, institutional
affiliation and status. To investigate both ends of the reward triangle empirically, we
analyzed co-authorship and acknowledgements in three sub-disciplinary journals in
political science from Germany from 2010 to 2017. We collected original data on the
authors, acknowledged persons in the respective section and their attributes (gender,
institutional affiliation, professional status).
We can corroborate our initially formulated assumption that co-authorship and
acknowledgement show homophily effects for most conditions.13 Considering
acknowledgments shows that many actors become more important when it comes to
credit-giving. This supports previous findings that few scholars are acknowledged
extensively while the large majority of scholars gets only few acknowledgements,

effects in our study.

show that

more

male than female

academics are

given credit

in the

acknowledgement section of articles (H1a). Authors tend to acknowledge other
individuals with the same gender and also tend to co-author articles with scholars of
the same gender (H1b). However, while the international relations journal (ZIB)
shows a heterophily effect with regard to acknowledgments, the political theory
journal (ZPTH) indicates heterophily relations regarding co-authors. The gender
heterophily effect in the ZIB might be explained by the higher number of female
scholars in the field and thus the sheer number of women who are able and willing
to comment other peoples work. This heterophile acknowledgement pattern might
indicate a greater gender balanced representation of female scholars and
participation in epistemic communities such as the German IR field. The finding for
the ZPTH might be explained by the publication of specific thematic sections in the
journal or the limited data availability, but this has to be further investigated.
Regarding the institutional affiliation we observed rather homophile relations in
co-authorship and acknowledgment links (H2). Researchers are more likely to
cooperate with their peers in the same institution and also acknowledge their
feedback and comments than co-authoring with or acknowledging scholars from
other institutions. Again, the political theory journal (ZPTH) shows a heterophile
effect, but this effect is rather small and might be a data artifact due to the small
dataset and sparse collaboration network in the ZPTH.

31

Our last hypothesis was related to scholars’ status (H3). The findings support our
expectation that these are rather homophile relations, but with crucial exceptions for
the professors status group and the political theory journal. In the ZPTH journal, the
acknowledgment links are rather heterophile across the postdoctoral and professor
status groups (H3) which might also be explained by the relative small size of the
sub-disciplinary community in Germany and, hence, the number of individuals who
can be asked to comment research articles (and are subsequently acknowledged for
this). We also detect a heterophile effect for the professors’ status group in the other
two journals.
Therefore, we do not only corroborate the expected difference between
collaboration patterns in theoretical work and in empirical-oriented research (A.
Díaz-Faes

&

Bordons,

2017;

Cronin

et

al.,

1993),

we

also

show

that

acknowledgements and co-authorships occur under different conditions in regard to
status groups.
We can conclude that we identified several homophily effects, most notably for
the institutional affiliation of scholars, but also report mixed homophile findings for
gender and status with regard to acknowledgements and co-authorship. This may
provide ground for further empirical investigation of the three conditions and
comparative studies of acknowledgements and co-authorship.
Our study has several limitations. The empirical part of the paper draws on a
rather small dataset. Therefore, our study has an explorative character highlighting
what a first attempt to collect systematically data on peer interactive communication

32

as one type of acknowledgements can detect in scientific collaboration.
Acknowledgements had to be extracted manually and further information on the
acknowledged persons were collected individually. This allows us to extend the
amount of information on authors’ attributes other studies use, although they rely on
a far higher number of publications. The study provides a first step for further
research on different types and conditions of collaboration.
Future studies on acknowledgements could use extended data sources such as
books and edited volumes. They could also examine the complete reward triangle
(authorship, acknowledgement, citation, social media presence) (Cronin & Weaver,
1995; Desrochers et al., 2018) to provide a full picture of academic collaboration
behavior. Additionally, tools for semi-automated extraction and recognition of
different types of acknowledgement could help to investigate these informal
cooperation actions on a larger scale. Yet, the larger the sample the more issues arise
concerning name disambiguation providing severe challenges to data validity.
Another limitation is that we cannot shed light on the black box of the concrete act
of acknowledgement. Mentioning colleagues in the respective section is an
intentional act on the author's side with no restrictions from the journal side who and
how many are named (or not). While the intentional act to acknowledge others might
lead to a 'reputational show off' that names researchers who have not provided any
comment, but are given credit to mark off their academic reputation on the author.
On the other hand, ‘acknowledgement amnesia’ (Costas & Leeuwen, 2012, p. 1650)
should also be considered. While preparing the manuscript scholars might just forget

33

some people who have actually provided valuable comments or they do not feel
obliged to acknowledge others. What authors motivates to acknowledge others and
how they consider whom to acknowledge was not possible to study with our data.
Hence, it might be worth investigating such acknowledgement behavior in a
qualitative way by conducting interviews with authors and acknowledged
individuals.
