Abstract

A widely-cited study reported evidence that White Americans reported higher ratings of how
much Whites are the victims of discrimination in the United States than of how much Blacks are
the victims of discrimination in the United States. However, much fewer than half of White
Americans rated discrimination against Whites in the United States today to be greater or more
frequent than discrimination against Blacks in the United States today, in data from the
American National Election Studies 2012 Time Series Study or in preregistered analyses of data
from the American National Election Studies 2016 Time Series Study or from a 2017 national
nonprobability survey. Given that relative discrimination against Black Americans is a
compelling justification for policies to reduce Black disadvantage, results from these three
surveys suggest that White Americans' policy preferences have much potential to move in a
direction that disfavors programs intended to reduce Black disadvantage.

Perceived Discrimination against Black Americans and White Americans

From slavery through Reconstruction through the civil rights movement and modern times, race
has been the "most difficult subject" in the United States (Kinder & Sanders, 1996, p. 11). The
U.S. population has become more racially diverse, but comparison of the treatment of Black
Americans to the treatment of White Americans has remained an important comparison for
assessing racial discrimination in the United States. Empirical evidence of discrimination against
Black Americans (e.g., Quillian, Pager, Hexel, & Midtbøen, 2017) can be balanced at least partly
with evidence of discrimination against White Americans (e.g., Axt, Ebersole, & Nosek, 2016),
as can prominent claims of discrimination in particular domains, such as police
disproportionately searching Black Americans (LaFraniere & Lehren, 2015) or of affirmative
action in college admissions disadvantaging White Americans (Hurley, 2016).
The presence of evidence of discrimination against Black Americans and of evidence of
discrimination against White Americans raises the question of the direction and size of the net
balance of Black/White discrimination in the United States. Perceptions of this balance have the
potential to influence legal outcomes and influence support for race-targeted programs (Carter &
Murphy, 2015, p. 274). Survey results reported in Norton and Sommers (2011) indicated that
White Americans now perceive this balance of discrimination to disfavor Whites, in a finding
has been cited in media outlets such as the New York Times (2011) and NPR (2011) and has
been frequently cited in social science publications (e.g., Todd, Bodenhausen, & Galinsky, 2012;
Mayrl & Saperstein, 2013; Cabrera, 2014; Hughley, 2014; Wilkins, Wellman, Babbitt, Toosi, &
Schad, 2015; Major & Kaiser, 2017; and West & Eaton, 2019).

However, the inference from Norton and Sommers (2011) that "Whites have now come
to view anti-White bias as a bigger societal problem than anti-Black bias" (p. 215) might be due
to the research design of that study. Participants in the Norton and Sommers (2011) study were
asked to "indicate how much you think [Blacks/Whites] [were/are] the victims of discrimination
in the United States in each of the following decades" (p. 217), with participants reporting
perceptions about discrimination against Blacks in each decade from the 1950s to the 2000s and
then reporting perceptions about discrimination against Whites in each decade from the 1950s to
the 2000s (p. 218). Consecutively rating discrimination against Blacks in a string of decades
might have caused participants to use as their reference point the participant's perception of
discrimination against Blacks in the immediately prior decade, instead of using as the reference
point the participant's perception of discrimination against Whites in the corresponding decade;
the same phenomenon might have occurred when participants subsequently rated discrimination
against Whites, focusing on ratings of discrimination against Whites being sensible across
decades for Whites instead of focusing on ratings being sensible in comparison to Blacks in a
given decade. Comparing participant ratings of discrimination against Blacks in the 2000s to
participant ratings of discrimination against Whites in the 2000s might thus produce an incorrect
inference about relative perceived discrimination in the 2000s.
For assessing whether White Americans really do perceive there to be more
discrimination in the United States today against Whites than against Blacks, the three studies
below reported on data from large-sample surveys that permit more straightforward research
designs that focus participants on the contemporary time period and/or on direct comparisons of
discrimination against Blacks and Whites in the United States today.

Study 1: ANES 2012 Time Series Study [Non-preregistered]
Data were from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2012 Time Series Study (The
American National Election Studies, 2016). The author's Institutional Review Board does not
require review and approval for analysis of de-identified datasets such as the ANES 2012 Time
Series Study.
Participants
Data analysis was limited to participants coded as non-Hispanic White who provided substantive
responses to the analyzed items. Per ANES documentation (2014, p. 7): the target population for
the survey was adult U.S. citizens; data for the key item are drawn from post-election interviews,
which were conducted between 7 November 2012 and 24 January 2013; and the estimated
AAPOR RR1 response rates for pre-election interviews were 38% for the face-to-face mode and
2% for the internet mode, with respective re-interview rates for the post-election interview of 94%
and 93%.
Measures
The key item for this analysis is: "How much discrimination is there in the United States today
against each of the following groups?". Target groups presented in random order included Blacks
and Whites. Response options were: "A great deal", "A lot", "A moderate amount", "A little",
and "None at all". The key item was used to construct three dichotomous variables, respectively
coded 1 if a participant rated discrimination against Blacks greater than discrimination against
Whites, rated discrimination against Blacks equal to discrimination against Whites, and rated
discrimination against Whites greater than discrimination against Blacks. The 15 non-Hispanic
White post-election interview cases without a substantive rating of both discrimination against

PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

Blacks and discrimination against Whites were excluded from the analysis, producing a sample
size of 3260 non-Hispanic Whites.
Results
For non-Hispanic White participants, weighted point estimates and 95% confidence intervals
indicated that 54% [51, 56] rated discrimination against Blacks greater than discrimination
against Whites, 37% [35, 39] rated discrimination against Blacks equal to discrimination against
Whites, and 10% [9, 11] rated discrimination against Whites greater than discrimination against
Blacks. The finding that only a small percentage of non-Hispanic Whites rated discrimination
against Whites greater than discrimination against Blacks held when the analysis was limited to
participants who responded online, in which concern about social desirability biasing reporting is
lessened: 11% [10, 13] of non-Hispanic Whites with substantive responses to the discrimination
items reported greater perceived discrimination against Whites than against Blacks. Moreover,
weighted analyses of the general discrimination item coded from 0 for discrimination rated at
"None at all" to 1 for discrimination rated at "A great deal" indicated that, among non-Hispanic
White participants in the online survey, respective mean ratings were 0.31 and 0.48 for
discrimination against Whites and discrimination against Blacks, with respective means of 0.24
and 0.73 among non-Hispanic Black participants.

Study 2: ANES 2016 Time Series Study [Confirmatory with Modifications Indicated]
In assessing whether the Study 1 finding replicated in the ANES 2016 Time Series Study, data
analyses followed a plan preregistered at the Open Science Framework
(https://osf.io/n7z4a/?view_only=9513766f9a1f498987c448fa87ba254e). Data were from the
ANES 2016 Time Series Study (American National Election Studies, University of Michigan, &

PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

Stanford University, 2018). The author's Institutional Review Board does not require review and
approval for analysis of de-identified datasets such as the ANES 2016 Time Series Study.
Hypotheses
The ANES 2016 Time Series Study included the Study 1 item and items regarding police and
federal government discrimination against Blacks relative to Whites. The corresponding
preregistered hypotheses were:
▪

H1 [directional]: White Americans will report perceiving more discrimination in the
United States today against blacks than against whites.

▪

H2 [directional]: White Americans will report perceiving that the police treat whites
better than blacks.

▪

H3 [non-directional]: White Americans might or might not report perceiving that the
federal government treats blacks better than whites.

H2 is directional and reflects the expectation that participants will perceive more police
discrimination against Blacks than against Whites, given factors such as then-recent prominent
media coverage of police shootings of Black Americans after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown
in Ferguson, Missouri (e.g., "Study finds police fatally shoot unarmed black men at
disproportionate rates", Lowery, 2016). H3 is non-directional, reflecting a lack of similarly
prominent media coverage suggesting anti-Black discrimination by the federal government and
the possibility that some participants might perceive government assistance to equally or
disproportionately benefit Blacks, such as an association between Blacks and welfare receipt
(Brown-Iannuzzi, Dotsch, Cooley, & Payne, 2017). H1 is directional and reflects the expectation
that the ANES 2012 Time Series Study pattern will replicate and the expectation that perceived
discrimination against Blacks will be greater than perceived discrimination against Whites given

the relative prominence of discrimination against Blacks in police shootings and other domains,
coupled with Black disadvantage in education (Sablich, 2016) and wealth (Traub et al., 2016).
Participants
Data analysis was limited to participants coded as non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black
and who provided substantive responses to the analyzed items, which were asked in the postelection interview. Per ANES documentation (2018, pp. 4-5): target populations for the surveys
were adult U.S. citizens in D.C. and the 48 contiguous states for the face-to-face mode and adult
U.S. citizens in D.C. and the 50 states for the internet mode; data for the key items are drawn
from post-election interviews, which were conducted between 9 November 2016 and 8 January
2017; and the estimated AAPOR RR1 response rates for pre-election interviews were 50% for
the face-to-face mode and 44% for the internet mode, with respective re-interview rates for the
post-election interview of 90% and 84%.
Measures
The post-election interview items analyzed were:
▪

"How much discrimination is there in the United States today against each of the
following groups?". Target groups presented in random order included Blacks and
Whites. Response options were: "A great deal", "A lot", "A moderate amount", "A
little", and "None at all". Post-election interview cases without a substantive response
to both items were excluded from the analysis: 99 non-Hispanic Whites (4%) and 26
non-Hispanic Blacks (8%).

▪

"In general, do the police treat whites better than blacks, treat blacks better than
whites, or treat them both the same?". Response options were: "Treat whites better",
"Treat both the same", and "Treat blacks better". Post-election interview cases

PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

9

without a substantive response to this item were excluded from the analysis: 34 nonHispanic Whites (1%) and 7 non-Hispanic Blacks (2%).
▪

"In general, does the federal government treat whites better than blacks, treat blacks
better than whites, or treat them both the same?". Response options were: "Treat
whites better", "Treat both the same", and "Treat blacks better". Post-election
interview cases without a substantive response to this item were excluded from the
analysis: 41 non-Hispanic Whites (2%) and 8 non-Hispanic Blacks (2%).

The software used in the analysis (StataCorp, 2017) did not report standard errors or
confidence intervals using the preregistered commands with weighting, because at least one
stratum had a single sampling unit so that a variance could not be estimated for that stratum.
Non-preregistered analyses were therefore conducted with each known available non-missing
option in the software for handling weighting for strata with a single sampling unit (centered,
certainty, and scaled); results are reported for the option that produced the largest standard errors,
which was the scaled option.
Results
Results in Table 1 and Figure 1 indicate that, among non-Hispanic Whites, 66% reported greater
perceived discrimination against Blacks than against Whites, 27% reported equal perceived
discrimination against Blacks and Whites, and 7% reported greater perceived discrimination
against Whites than against Blacks; respective percentages were 51%, 48%, and 1% for the
police discrimination item and 30%, 47%, and 23% for the federal government item. Results
regarding Whites' general perceptions of discrimination and Whites' perceptions of
discrimination by police were consistent with the preregistered directional hypotheses. Ends of
95% confidence intervals for the paired percentages did not overlap for any of the three

PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

10

comparisons of the percentage that reported better treatment of Black Americans to the
percentage that reported better treatment of White Americans. Moreover, in a non-preregistered
analysis, the p-value was less than p=.001 for a Wald test of the hypothesis that the constant in a
linear regression predicting a dichotomous variable coded 1 for participants who reported greater
discrimination against Black Americans equaled the constant in a linear regression predicting a
dichotomous variable coded 1 for participants who reported greater discrimination against White
Americans. Table 1 results also indicated that, in all three items, Black Americans perceived
more favorable treatment for Whites than for Blacks, with ends of the 95% confidence intervals
not overlapping for any comparison of the percentage that reported better treatment of Black
Americans to the percentage that reported better treatment of White Americans.
Non-preregistered weighted analyses indicated that the key inference held when limiting
the analysis to participants who responded online: 7% [5, 8] of non-Hispanic Whites with
substantive responses to the general discrimination items reported greater perceived
discrimination against Whites than against Blacks. Moreover, non-preregistered weighted
analyses of the general discrimination item coded from 0 for discrimination rated at "None at all"
to 1 for discrimination rated at "A great deal" indicated that, among non-Hispanic White
participants in the online survey, respective mean ratings were 0.27 and 0.58 for discrimination
against Whites and discrimination against Blacks, with respective means of 0.20 and 0.79 among
non-Hispanic Black participants.

Study 3: 2017 YouGov Survey [Confirmatory with Modifications Indicated]
The ANES general discrimination items analyzed in Study 1 and Study 2 asked participants to
respond to an item about the level of discrimination against Blacks and to a separate item about
the level of discrimination against Whites; the ANES items also referred to "discrimination" in a
way that could permit participants to respond based on a combination of the perceived frequency
of discrimination and the perceived strength of discrimination. Providing a clearer inference
about participant perceptions, the key item in Study 3 asked participants to directly compare their
perceived frequency of discrimination against Blacks to their perceived frequency of
discrimination against Whites.
Data analysis of the 2017 survey followed a plan preregistered at the Open Science
Framework (https://osf.io/q7ufz/?view_only=f304b515175d4af4a805e4a3b26776d9), with one
hypothesis, reflecting the expectation that the key pattern in Study 1 and Study 2 will replicate:
▪

H1: A higher proportion of non-Hispanic Whites will report that Black Americans are
more often the victim of discrimination in the United States today than White
Americans are, compared to the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites that report that
White Americans are more often the victim of discrimination in the United States
today than Black Americans are.

U.S. resident adult participants from a YouGov opt-in survey panel completed an online
survey fielded between 27 July 2017 and 31 July 2017, with a final sample of 2,000 participants,
of which the randomization assigned 359 non-Hispanic Whites and 52 non-Hispanic Blacks to
the item for this study; see Appendix A for more information on the construction of the sample.
The key item was: "In the United States today, which of the following two groups is more often
the victim of discrimination, compared to the other group?". Response options were "Black

PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

14

Americans", "White Americans", and "Both groups are the victim of discrimination equally often
in the United States today", with the order of the first two response options randomly reversed
and the third response option always third. The research for Study 3 received approval from the
author's Institutional Review Board.
The key item was used to construct three dichotomous variables, respectively coded 1 if
the participant selected the "Black Americans", "White Americans", and "Both groups..." options.
Results for weighted analyses reported in Table 2 indicate that a larger percentage of nonHispanic Whites selected the option indicating that Black Americans are more often the victim of
discrimination in the United States today (43%), compared to the percentage that selected the
option indicating that White Americans are more often the victim of discrimination in the United
States today (12%); the p-value was less than p=.001 for a Wald test of the hypothesis that the
constant in a linear regression predicting the "Black Americans" outcome variable equaled the
constant in a linear regression predicting the "White Americans" outcome variable, supporting
the preregistered directional hypothesis. Moreover, results indicated that 42% of non-Hispanic
Whites selected the option that both groups are the victim of discrimination equally often in the
United States today.

General Discussion

Results reported in Norton and Sommers (2011) indicated that, in the United States today,
Whites perceive that Whites are the victims of discrimination more than Blacks are the victims
of discrimination. However, analyses of data from three recent large-sample national surveys
indicated that White Americans do not perceive discrimination the United States today against
Whites to be greater or more frequent than discrimination against Blacks. This discrepancy might
be due to the research design of Norton and Sommers (2011), in which participants rated
discrimination against Blacks in a series of decades and then rated discrimination against Whites
in a series of decades, but were not asked to directly compare discrimination in the United States
today against Whites to discrimination in the United States today against Blacks.
Discussing results from the 2016 PRRI/Brookings Immigration Survey, Jones et al. (2016)
reported that 57% of White Americans agreed that "Today discrimination against whites has
become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities" (p. 2). This result
might be perceived to be in tension with the patterns reported for non-Hispanic Whites in the
studies above, but this finding does not indicate that Whites believe that Whites face more
discrimination than Blacks face; the 57% estimate is consistent with Study 3 results in which a
combined 54% of non-Hispanic Whites reported the perception that, relative to the frequency of
discrimination against Black Americans, White Americans are more often (12%) or equally often
(42%) the victim of discrimination in the United States today.
This 42% estimate from Study 3 of the percentage of White Americans' who perceive
equality in the frequency of Black/White discrimination can be paired with estimates of
Black/White discrimination equality of 37% and 27% from Study 1 and Study 2 to produce the
inference that a nontrivial percentage of White Americans perceive there to be similar levels of

16

PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION

17

discrimination against Blacks as against Whites. This perception and the perception of more
discrimination against White Americans than against Black Americans can have important
consequences for attitudes and policy preferences. For example, Wellman, Liu, and Wilkins
(2016) reported results suggesting that "when White people perceive increased anti-White bias, it
leads them to view interracial relations as zero-sum and to reject Affirmative Action" (p. 433),
and Wilkins et al. (2015) reported results suggesting that "perceiving greater bias against men or
Whites may be associated with favoring policies that ultimately hurt women and Blacks" (p. 11).
To the extent that Norton and Sommers (2011) overestimated the percentage of White
Americans who perceive there to be more discrimination against Whites than against Blacks in
the United States today, Norton and Sommers (2011) might cause an overestimate of the
potential change in White Americans' attitudes that might have already occurred due to increases
in perceived anti-White discrimination. Discrimination against Black Americans is a compelling
justification for policies to reduce Black disadvantage, and results from Studies 1, through 3
suggest that White Americans' preferences have more potential to become less favorable about
programs that are intended to reduce Black disadvantage, compared to estimates of this potential
based on Norton and Sommers (2011).

Appendix A

Text description of the 2017 survey, drawn from the data deliverables from YouGov:
"YouGov interviewed 2040 respondents who were then matched down to a
sample of 2000 to produce the final dataset. The respondents were matched to a
sampling frame on gender, age, race, education, ideology, and political interest.
The frame was constructed by stratified sampling from the full 2010 American
Community Survey (ACS) sample with selection within strata by weighted
sampling with replacements (using the person weights on the public use file).
Data on voter registration status and turnout were matched to this frame using the
November 2010 Current Population Survey. Data on interest in politics and party
identification were then matched to this frame from the 2007 Pew Religious Life
Survey."
"The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity scores.
The matched cases and the frame were combined and a logistic regression was
estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity score function included age,
gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, region, voter registration status,
political interest, and ideology. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles
of the estimated propensity score in the frame and post-stratified according to
these deciles. The weights were then post-stratified to a four-way stratification of
gender, four-category age, four-category race, and four-category education, to
produce the final weight."
