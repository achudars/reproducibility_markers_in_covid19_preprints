"1" "Young Adults’ First Family Formation: Is Family Process Influential?"
"2" "Abstract"
"3" "  This study examines the association between adolescents’ family process, their first union formation (e.g. marriage and cohabitation) and relationship satisfaction of those unions. This research uses  e vent  h istory  a nalysis  and  data  from  the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 of adolescents ( n = 4765) to address  how  the mechanisms  of social learning  affects timing to union formation and relationship satisfaction . It reveals how entering marriage or cohabitation, and relationship quality for the first unions varies according to family routines, parental monitoring, and parent-adolescent relationships. Additionally, the effects of family process in accordance with life-course stage, and parental divorce are assessed. Findings indicate that experiencing positive family process is associated with higher likelihood of marriage versus cohabitation, and greater relationship satisfaction. In addition, it is more influential in early adulthood, and two biological parents mediate the greater positive influence of family process."

"5" "Introduction    "
"6" "Adolescence is a crucial stage to develop close romantic ties (Erikson, 1963), and family process during adolescence ha ve  a subsequent influence on the behavio u ral and psychological outcomes of young adults (Cox ,  & Harter, 2003; Flouri ,  & Buchanan, 2003). A positive relationship with parents is associated with later leaving of  the  parents’   home to form different living arrangements (Goldscheider ,  & Goldscheider, 1993). Positive parent-adolescence  relationships  and family environment s  provide a comfortable pathway to family formations, and higher satisfaction in those unions. Meanwhile, lower  rates  of marriage have been offset by cohabitation  for the first union formation in the United States (Manning, Brown ,  & Payne, 2014). In addition, the average age of first marriage has been increased in the past two decades, but the timing of forming the first coresidential union has not changed considerably (Kennedy ,  & Bumpass, 2008; Manning, Brown, & Payne, 2014). Previous research reveals that young adults who form their unions at younger ages are more likely to cohabit, which is not a stable arrangement, and cohabitation also is not as beneficial a union as marriage for young couples and their children’s well-being (Axinn ,  & Thornton 1992; Cohen ,  & Manning, 2010; Cohen ,  & Manning, 2015)."
"7" " Adolescence   is associated with  increasing autonomy from family, and more peer group relations  than during  childhood ( Furstenberg , 2000 ). They are less likely to engage in shared activities with their parents and they may have more disagreements with both or one of them (Smetana, Campione-Barr, & Metzger, 2006). Although the relationships out of home become important during adolescence, parents remain crucial resources to affect adolescents in the pathway of first family formation. Control and closeness are two key components, which  contribute to  positive relationship s  between adolescents and parents (Maccoby ,  & Martin 1983). Thus, a positive family process  and environment   are  characterized by support and emotional connectedness within the members of a family (Barber ,  & Buehler,1996; Varda ,  & Talmi, 2018). Individuals who experienced a more supportive emotional environment from their parents may feel more enthusiasm to form unions with more warmth and stable conditions (Dutton, Lussier, & Sabourin, 2009). The ways family process es  influence family formation behavio u rs are important, and change over time, however, we know less about the role of earlier family experiences for first union outcomes."
"8" "To address this gap in the literature, this research used nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) to assess the relation ship  between  family process measures during adolescence ,  and young adults’ first union formation behavio u r. This study used the index of family routines,  the  degree of parental knowledge scale, and  the  parent-adolescent relationships scale by residential fathers and mothers as  a measure of  family process to examine timing  of first union formation, along with  type  or union and  relationship satisfaction  within the union . This research was guided by social learning theory and employ s  an event history analysis  analytical framework  to examine how family  relationships, and  experiences have  connected  with individuals' first coresidential  relationship  arrangements.  In this analysis, the question of how  these factors  are  associated with timing, and different types of first union (e.g. marriage and cohabitation)  is examined.   A key question guiding this analysis is: is  the influence of family process  the same  over time from adolescence through adulthood ?  Additionally, this research examines the association between family process and relationship satisfaction in first unions. "
"9" "Theoretical Framework"
"10" "Adolescence is a crucial stage of  the  life-course in forming the roots of later romantic relationship behavio u r (Conger, Cui, Bryant, & Elder, 2000). Family process es  in adolescence may continue to influence individuals’ subsequent behavio u r within romantic relationships  later in life  (Thornton, Axinn, & Xie. 2007; Parade, Supple ,  & Helms, 2012). A positive relationship between parents and adolescents provides more closeness and involvement among family members. Adolescents with a high-quality family process may have a healthier pathway for transition to adulthood to a more stable and enjoyable family formation union in adulthood (Mitchell, Wister, & Burch, 1989; Goldscheider ,  & Goldscheider, 1993). Social learning theory emphasizes that parents shape their adolescents’ attitudes, and intentions in later life to form  their unions (Bengtson, 1975). Family processes during adolescence lead them to more similar or close attitudes, values, and preferences due to common social positions, backgrounds, and experiences with their parents. Thus, individuals may form and value their union formation in accordance with their parents (Furman, Simon, Shaffer, & Bouchey, 2002). According to experiences during adolescence, young adults may imitate and desire coresidential romantic relationships close to their parental family environment.  In fact , family process predicts outcomes later  in  individuals' lives and in family formation behavio u r.    "
"11" "There are limited studies that have examined family process and family formation behavio u rs. There is some suggestion that people who cohabit at relatively young ages had more conflictual, less supportive family environments, and low family belonging ( Conger, Cui, Bryant, & Elder, 2000 ; Senia, Neppl, Gudmunson, Donnellan, & Lorenz, 2016; Thorsen, 2017). The study by Starrels and Holm (2000) examined the effects of parental socialization on adolescents’ plans for marriage and parenthood and it found that family factors (e.g. mothers’ intention, fathers’ decision making, and chores) predict young adults’   family formation attitudes. Moreover, parental warmth, supportive parenting, and consistent discipline are associated with adolescents’   and young adults’ romantic relationship quality (Tyrell, Wheeler, Gonzales, Dumka, & Millsap , 2 014; Parade et al.  2012) . Thus, experiencing a  stronger  parent-adolescence connection, and more involvement in family activities positively provide a smoother pathway for timing  of union formation and  selection between cohabitation or marriage, and relationship satisfaction of the first family formation unions."
"12" "Family process is made by subsystems such as  the  parental marital relationship, parenting style, parental monitoring, family routines, and parent-adolescent relationships. These subsystems are independent of each other and work as a family system together. Family process  approach has a multidirectional structure and the interaction between family members is a crucial determinant to assess the complexity of everyday family life (Daly, 2003; Day, Gavazzi, & Acock, 2001).  One of the main measures of family process is  the  family routine which mean s  specific, repeated practices with at least two members of a family. Family routines establish more family connections, cohesion, family identity, and developing a sense of family stability, which provide positive emotional atmosphere of daily family life (Spagnola ,  & Fiese , 2 007; Day, Gavazzi, Miller, & van Langeveldt, 2009). Moreover, a  stronger  family routine is linked with family rituals which provide more warmth and closeness between family members (Dollahite, Marks, & Goodman , 2 004). Another measure of family process is monitoring and awareness of parents that is the key dimension for adolescent development of interest, which means controlling adolescence activities, relationship s  with friends, level of attention given to them, and setting expectations for their behavio u rs (Dishion ,  & McMahon, 1998). Positive parental monitoring is associated with more connections between parents and adolescents, which provide more stability and warmth in family environment (Fletcher, Steinberg, & Williams-Wheeler, 2004, Dillon, Pantin, Robbins, & Szapocznik, 2008, Cottrell, Harris, D’Alessandri, Atkins, Richardson, & Stanton, 2007). However, poor monitoring is associated with an earlier transition to adulthood such as earlier time of being a father (Hofferth ,  & Goldscheider,   2010). In addition, the positive quality of parent-adolescent relationship is an important measurement of family process which is  characterized  by higher levels of supportiveness and identification behavio u rs of parents toward adolescences (Hair, Moore, Garrett, Kinukawa, Lippman ,  & Michelson,   2005). Evidence indicates that praise and encouragement between parents and adolescents  can  have positive outcomes for adolescents including better mental well-being, and more life satisfaction (Flouri & Buchanan, 2003; Hair, Moore, Hadley, Kaye, Day ,  & Orthner,   2009)."
"13" " Overall,  a  positive family process provides a secure transition to adulthood. Experiencing  a  positive family process has considerable influences on adolescents’ family formation,  including later  formation of the first union, and a  tendency to place  higher value on their romantic relationships.  Also, a  positive family environment  could play  an important  factor for young  adults’   decisions to  delay leaving their parents’ home or  in  other choices like continuing education. Moreover, due to having positive connections with their parents, and experiencing  a  positive family environment, they may have more positive attitudes toward marriage versus cohabitation  and express a desire to  imitate  the  positive family  environments from their adolescence  during adulthood."
"14" "This research was designed to extend  the  knowledge of family process effects on the formation and relationship satisfaction of the first union. This study examine s  four main hypotheses. First, it is expected that low family process  will be  associated with an earlier first union formation, and  a  higher likelihood of cohabitation  compared to  marriage. Second, the type of the first union formation  is expected to vary with  individuals' age, and the influence of the family process predictors  will  not remain consistent over time. Through adolescence to adulthood, the strength of these experiences by parents may decrease in transition into adulthood (Elder ,   &  Shanahan, 2006). However, some family process measures may have more long-lasting influence across the life course. Therefore, it is expected that family process measures prevent early family formation union, and they may have enduring effects for young adults due to process of social learning, and especially observational learning.   Third, parenting practices in intact families have positive outcomes for adolescents to have normal attitudes regarding family formation   (Wolfinger , 2 003). Living with two parents during adolescence provides more positive marital outcomes, higher levels of sense of family belonging than nontraditional families  (Hofferth ,  & Anderson, 2003; Brown ,  & Manning, 2009). Previous research indicated two-parent families monitor and control their children more than other types of families (Forste ,  & Jarvis 2007; McLanahan ,  & Sandefur, 1994).  Separation and divorce are the main reasons that disrupt adolescences’ routines lives, communication, and lower monitoring of with at least one parent (Sobolewski ,  & Amato , 2 007). This research examines how family process influence is similar between intact families and divorced families on the formation of first union and its relationship satisfaction. Fourth, the last aim of this research is to examine how poor family process  has  placed adolescents at risk for future problems in their marriage and cohabitation. It is expected that young adults with low family processes during adolescence  will  report lower relationship satisfaction in their first union than young adults who has higher family process in their adolescence."
"15" "M ethods"
"16" "Data Source"
"17" "The National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), a prospective nationally representative survey of youth from the birth cohort 1980-84,  is  used for this research.  The first wave started in 1997 with 8,984 individuals with oversamples of  b lack and Hispanic youth when the participants were between the ages of 12 to 18, and the respondents have been re-interviewed annually since. The NLSY97 includes  repeated measures  of unions , relationships, and family process measurements to examine family formation outcomes in the United States. In addition, a resident parent or guardian was  interviewed   at the first wave,  and this is  used to identify parents’ educational attainment, and family structure  variables . This research use s  all seventeen rounds until 2015 when respondents were between 30 to 36 years old."
"18" "S tudy variables"
"19" "T wo dependent variables in this research were the occurrence of the first marriage, cohabitation, and relationship satisfaction in those relationships. First, NLSY97 asks participants their marital status in each wave . The first outcome of union formation is coded as cohabiting if the respondent was single at the preceding wave and responded  “ never married, cohabitating ”  at the following wave. Similarly, if a respondent had previously reported being single and in subsequent waves reported being   “married, spouse present ” and “ married, spouse absent’ , the event variable was coded  as  entering  into marriage. Those reported “ never married, not cohabiting ” were considered for who remained single , and would be considered censored for the event if they never experience one of the two changes described above .  This coding scheme is followed for all waves in the data ."
"20" "The second outcome, relationship satisfaction, is measured in the  NLSY97 in nine waves . This response reflects the respondents r elationship satisfaction and the respondents answered questions regarding the level of care they received from their partner. This variable is not an item that reflected general satisfaction, but when the validity was examined in contrast with other relationship satisfaction predictors was comparable  ( Bartle-Haring, Shannon, Holowacz, Patton ,   & Lotspeich-Younkin , 2017 ). The range of spouse or partner cared about was between 0 to 10. A binominal time-varying measure was  designed, which  0 to 5 were the indicator of lower relationship satisfaction, and 6 to 10 illustrated a higher relationship satisfaction. In addition,  according to changes in the marital status of young adults, those who braked up first unions, the last score of relationship satisfaction was used f rom the last round of breakup. "
"21" "Three measures of family process were examined including family routines, parental monitoring, and parent-adolescent relationship. These measures were designed as time-varying  variables during adolescence. This index had four questions and each question had a range from 0 days per week to 7 days per week.  The  NLSY97 asked adolescents how many days they in a typical week eat dinner with the family, help their parents in housework,  having  fun with them, and has something religious as a family.  Therefore, the potential range was from 0 to 28, and higher scores indicated more days spent in routine activities with the family. Family routine in this research was coded from 0 to 16 as low family routines, and 15 to 28 as average to high family routines."
"22" "The parental monitoring scale was based on four questions asking if the young adult’s residential parents knew about adolescents’ friends, friends’ parent(s), educational status, and teachers. The parental monitoring scale was the sum of these four item scores and had a range from 0 to 16. The degree of parental monitoring by residential mother in the current research was coded as 0 to 8 as low parental monitoring versus 9 to 16 as high parental monitoring. Lastly, the parent-adolescent relationship scale was used, which included adolescents' responses to the questions regarding admiring their parents, willing to be like parents, spending time with them; receiving praise, criticism, blame, and assistance from parent(s). Moreover, the scale included whether or not the parent(s) was the adolescent’s role model, and whether or not they canceled plans with their child. These eight questions were measured on a five-point scale (0–4) and the question’s range was between 0 to 32. The low parent-adolescent relationship was considered for less than 16 points, and more than 16 was the indicator of average-to-high parent-adolescent relationships. "
"23" "Information about family structure during adolescence was used to see how having an intact family mediates family process’ effects on offspring union behavio u r. Parental divorce was created with a combination of several sets of variables. First, in the first round, one parent  was asked about all previous marriages and divorces. In the second set of variables,  each respondent  whose parents divorced after Round 1 were grouped. In Rounds 6, 11, and 13, the  respondent  was asked whether their parents had divorced within the last 5 years. Information from these sets of variables was used to create a  binary  variable for having an intact family or divorced  parental  family.  In addition to gender and race/ethnicity to control the analyses, several other experiences of individuals were applied to test family formation factors in this research."
"24" "The study controlled for the onset of sexual behavio u r before 18, educational attainment, employment, and educational enrollment status as life-course events, and  maternal  education, and age of the biological mother when the respondent was born was used to control mothers’  characteristics . The onset of sexual intercourse was captured by asking a question that the participants ever had sexual intercourse. This time-varying variable was designed to test how sexual intercourse as a risky behavio u r before 18 predicted subsequent family formation behavio u rs. The educational attainment status was transformed into four categorical groups including less than high school, high school, associate degree, and  bachelor’s  degree  or more. A binomial time-varying variable was designed for employment status, which was captured those working part-time, and full-time as employed, and those were not working as unemployed. The last time-varying controlling variable was enrollment status, which considered those attended in all type of schools, colleges, and those not enrolled."
"25" "Analytic   strategy"
"26" "Event  h istory  a nalysis is  used to  assess the  impacts of the  family pro cess  measures  on  first union in two different analyses.  The first analysis examines  the overall effects of family processes on young adults first union-formation, and  the second analysis  examin es  the influence of family process measures on first union satisfaction. The sample was organized in a person-period file,  with separate records form each  respondent for each  year that the participants were single at age 15. In the next stage, a discrete-time multinomial logistic regression was used for family process measures to examine the timing, and type of the first union, and a discrete-time binominal logistic regression was applied for relationship satisfaction. Once the young adult reported the first family formation, remained subsequent years of data were omitted. The analyses were conducted with three models. Models 1 included only the family process variables, model 2 assessed the interaction between family process measures and family structure, and model 3 included the family process measures with the controlling variables.  All analyses were done using R  software ( Willekens, 2014 )."
"27" "Results"
"28" "Descriptive Results"
"29" "Table 1 indicated the weighted descriptive of young adults and included 2325 women 49% and 2440 men 51% with an average age of 23.5. Whites were nearly 52% of the sample, Blacks, and Hispanics were 28%, and 20% respectively. For descriptive purposes, family process measures were selected from the first wave. 60 %  of the sample reported low family routines. The adolescents who reported low mother monitoring 28% were lower than father monitoring. In comparison with parental monitoring, the scale of parent-adolescent relationships had a close rate of reporting low relationship with mothers and fathers. Around 6% and 9% of the sample had poor relationship with their residential mothers, and fathers respectively. Family structure was a time-varying variable in this research, and one out four of the young adults had parental divorce during the survey. 40 %  of the adolescents had mothers with high school, 24 %  of mothers had less than high school, and more than 36% of them had academic education. More than 13 %  of the mothers were less than 20 years when the participants  were  born."
"30" "Regarding individual factors, the last wave of observation was reported in the descriptive table. The young adults who finished high school were 54%, and around 20% had  post-secondary  education. More than 58% of the sample were employed, and just 8% of the sample attended schools, and universities in 2015. More than 1 out of 3 young adults in the sample had sexual intercourse before 18. For the formation of the first union, one out four of the sample remained single at 2015, 18 %  married, and 57 %  cohabited. Lastly, just 8 %  of the sample reported low satisfaction for the first union in round 2008."
"31" "Transition to First Marriage"
"32" "Table 2 included odds ratios from event-history models using multinomial logistic regression to examine the transition to the first union formation  event . These models were shown in two different  sections to illustrate the models for  marriage and cohabitation , versus remaining single (the reference for the outcome) . Results from the model 1a, presented in the first column, indicated average-to-high family routines, parental monitoring, and parent-adolescent relationships had a significant effect on higher marriage’s risk. Lower family routines were associated with 72 %  lower likelihood of marriage, and lower mother and father monitoring decreased the likelihood of marriage for 13, and 30 %  respectively.  Weaker  relationships with a mother and father were associated with 24, and 40 %  respectively  l ower likelihood of marriage. By adding control variables  in model 2a , family routines and parent-adolescent remained significant in the third model for entering marriage. Lower family routines, and  weaker  mother-adolescent relationships increased  the effect size  in the third model, whereas adolescents with poor relationships with fathers had the same odds ratio  as compared to  the first model."
"33" "The second model included the interaction between age and parental divorce with family process measures. The inclusion of interactions with age indicated that  the  family routine effect  decreased  as the respondents aged . Adolescents with high family routines were more likely to form marriage for the first union during early adulthood, and the mid-twenties. Model 2a, and 3a indicated individuals with low family routines in early adulthood had around 76 %  lower likelihood of marriage than those with average-to-high family routines, and the  relative  odds in mid-twenties decreased to 40 % . This analysis indicated family routines were an influential factor to increase the likelihood of entering marriage before the 30s, regardless of socioeconomic backgrounds, and life course transitions. Individuals with a poor relationship with their mother in early adulthood had lower odds  of marrying  (odds ratio = 0.87), and in mid twenty the likelihood decreased to around 20 % . Moreover,  weaker  father-adolescent relationship s   were  associated with 23 %  lower likelihood of entering marriage in early adulthood. Low er  family routines in divorced families was associated with lower likelihood of marriage with 37% and increased to 61 %   after  adding control variable s . Formation of the first union  among respondents  of divorced families with low father monitoring was associated with lower likelihood of marriage. This may suggest that parental monitoring among intact families  may promote marriage over cohabitation ."
"34" "In addition, young adults whose mothers had more than a high school education were more likely to marry  ( 15%).  Blacks were less likely to marry (51%) than Whites, and Hispanics had higher risk of marry (19%) than other races.   Regarding life-course events, having academic education was associated with higher risk of marriage  than those with less than high school (46%) , and h aving a job was associated with 44% higher risk of marriage ."
"35" "Transition to First Cohabitation"
"36" "The assessment of  how  family process  affected timing of  first cohabitation indicated that low er  family routines and  parent- a dolescent relationship s   were influential factors  to  enter cohabitation. Low family routines, and poor relationships with mothers and fathers were associated with 89 %,  66% , and 59 %  higher risk of cohabiting for the first union. Controlling these family processes in model 3b attenuated the odds ratio around 20 %  for family routines and parent-adolescent relationships."
"37" "The interaction of family routines  and age of the respondent  indicated that individuals in their 20s with low family routines were considerably more likely to enter a cohabiting union (more than 80 % )  compared to individuals with who more reported  higher  family routines. Moreover, poor relationship s  with mothers and fathers was associated with a 33 and 56 %  higher likelihood of early cohabitation than those who had positive relationships with their parents. Therefore, average-to-high family routines, and parent-adolescent relationship were associated with lower likelihood of cohabitation, particularly in early adulthood. Lastly, low family routines in divorced families were associated with more than 50 %  increase in the odds  of cohabitating for the first union compared to those in two biological families with higher family routines. Additionally, low  maternal  monitoring in divorced families was associated with 20 %  higher  odds of cohabiting . The results indicated that poor relationship s  with fathers in divorced families was associated with 40 %  higher risk of cohabitation than those with a positive relation with father in intact families.  In the opposite direction with first marriage, young adults whose mothers had more than a high school education had a lower likelihood of cohabitation (25%)."
"38" "Moreover, young adults with younger  mothers were  more likely to form cohabitation than marriage.  The analysis  illustrates   a  40% higher likelihood of cohabitation for t hose with  a  high school  education  than  those with less than  a high  school, while  there is a  20 percent lower  odds  for young adults with  college education  than young adults who could not finish high school.  The enrollment in schools or universities decreased the likelihood of cohabitation to 48%.  Lastly,   t hose  that  reported sexual activity before 18 years old were more likely to cohabit rather than young adults who had sexual intercourse after this age."
"39" "Relationship Satisfaction in First Union"
"40" "Family routines, and parent-adolescent relationships were  the  family process measures in this research that  were hypothesized to  affect   relationship satisfaction in the first union (Table 3). Lower family routines were associated with around 70 %  lower relationship satisfaction in the first model, and around 35 %  in the third model. Having a  weaker  relationship with  one’s  mother and father were associated with 55 % , and 33 %  odds  of  report ing  lower satisfaction in the first union. The analyses indicated there was no significant  interaction  between family processes and parental divorce.   In addition,  young adults whose mothers had more than a high school education  had a  considerabl y  higher  likelihood to report  a satisfactory r elationship in the first union ( 74 % ) .  R egarding life-course events, having   a  bachelor  or higher degrees   was associated with higher relationship satisfaction  (36%). F emales were 45% less likely to be satisfied in  their  union s , and  b lacks were more likely to had relationship with lower satisfaction (59%)."
"41" "Discussion"
"42" "It is  crucial  to assess family process influence with regard to first family formation union and its relationship satisfaction to determine the conditions under which parents’ effects are more or less likely to exist. The present study contributes to the literature  by making  four important contributions to  the  understanding of  t he effects of  a child’s  parents during adolescence  on  subsequent first marriage and cohabitation by age 35  and satisfaction in their first relationship ."
"43" "First, the quality of family process matters and  it  is related to the determinants of first union formation. Although parental monitoring indicates no significant association with  cohabitation, it has  a  significant association with first marriage,  an  adolescence’s family routines, and  the  parent-adolescent relationship indicate s  significant association s  with the formation of  the  first union. Therefore, having  a  positive family process may increase the likelihood of entering marriage, but adolescents who experienced  a  positive family process are less likely to enter cohabitation for  their first  union.  Second, the influence of  the  family process predictors on the likelihood of entering marriage and cohabitation were not constant across age. Those with higher family routines and positive relationships with  their  parents were more likely to marry in the 20s.  In addition, higher family routines, and positive parent-adolescent relationships are influential factors to avoid cohabitation in early adulthood. The findings of this research suggest that contemporary young adults who had poor family process es  may have faster transitions into the first union and  that union is more likely to be  cohabitation instead of marriage. The findings are consistent with the results by the research of Thorsen (2017) that discussed the influence of stressful family environment was important during adolescence and early adulthood, but this decreased as people age."
"44" "Third, young adults with positive family process in two biological families are more likely to marry than cohabit for their first union.    T he findings from this research suggest that intact families mediate greater positive effects of family process for young adults than divorced families, particularly  when considering  family routines.  Fourth , higher family routines, and positive parent-adolescent relationships indicated higher relationship satisfaction in first unions, and it suggests that adolescents with positive family process are more likely to imitate the family environments they had during adolescence."
"45" "There are several limitations to the research. First, family routines, parental monitoring were measured in four points and parent-adolescent relationships were asked in three waves. The  fluid nature of family relations in the current research provides the importance of parents on family formation behavio u rs for young adults. However, a longer measure provides a richer and more detailed picture of family relations. Although the data was longitudinal, there was no information on family processes during childhood, and early adulthood. Second, the assessment of attitudes of parents and young adults regarding cohabitation, marriage, and partnering could enrich the data. This information could  allow for us to understand how  parental socialization may  affect  subsequent romantic relationships for adolescents, which considerably affect s  first marriage and cohabitation. Future work should examine in more detail what constitutes  a  developmentally appropriate paren tal routine  during the transition to adulthood.  The f amily environment works as a launching pad for adolescents  in their  own  subsequent family formation behavio u r s , therefore, how family process es   are  varied among different cultures, races, and gender s  are important to investigate. Lastly, this research indicated fathers matter similarly to mothers through family process  as to how they  determine timing, types  of first union  and relationship satisfaction. The research by Ryan, Martin, and Brooks-Gunn (2006) discussed that fathers provide unique relationships with their offspring. Therefore, father’s role in transition into adulthood in union formation should be evaluated with a greater significance."
"46" "Conclusions"
"47" "The evidence of this resear ch brings new insight to the literature by highlighting that the influence of the family process on young adults' first union formation is important particularly during adolescence and early adulthood. This research indicates an individual with a poor family process may cohabit as a way to escape from a disadvantaged family environment at earlier ages when they may have fewer resources to marry.  Early cohabitation can have negative  consequences on individuals such as less stability of the union, having more problematic relationship skills, and spending less time to solve issues (Cohan & Kleinbaum, 2002). Additionally, the findings indicate that poor family process is associated with lower relationship satisfaction. The negative consequences from family process may carry into young adults’ family formation and make first unions more vulnerable for couples over time. Therefore, lower satisfaction in the first union formation forms attitudes and relationship processes, which affect subsequent stages of life course."
