FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
Abstract
The functional theory of attitudes (Katz, 1960) proposes that if persuasive messages target the
reason why the audience possesses an attitude on that subject (the attitude’s function), such
messages will be more persuasive than if they target a different function. The “functional
matching” effect was tested by meta-analyzing 16 articles, which reported 38 relationships
between matching and persuasiveness and had a combined sample of 1,460. The functional
matching effect was consistently strong across all moderators (r = .37). The use of the selfmonitoring scale to identify functions produced a somewhat smaller effect than the average.
Research employing other means of identifying attitude functions is called for. No evidence was
found consistent with publication bias. Future directions for functional attitude theory research
based on these results are discussed.

FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
A Meta-Analysis of the Functional Matching Effect Based on Functional Attitude Theory
In 1960, Daniel Katz made the provocative claim that, “unless we know the
psychological need which is met by the holding of an attitude we are in a poor position to predict
when and how it will change” (p. 170). Katz constructed a typology of the functions that an
attitude might serve by surveying different motivational theories. The work of Katz and the
parallel work of Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) laid out a research agenda for persuasion
researchers to substantially improve the ability of persuaders to target their audience using
functional attitude theory. Katz’s article discussed each function and made suggestions for how
to change attitudes by matching the persuasive message to the function. If the right function
could be targeted, the message would be substantially more persuasive. This hypothesis is
referred to as the functional matching effect. Unfortunately, the functional attitude approach
inspired little research in its time as neither Katz nor Smith et al. were able to produce effective
methods of conducting research into the effectiveness of matching functions. Smith et al. based
their approach on qualitative interviews and conducted no studies on functional matching. Katz
and his colleagues conducted a few studies on the ego-defensive function that found mixed
results and did not offer ways of studying the other functions (Katz, McClintock, & Sarnoff,
1957; Katz, Sarnoff, & McClintock, 1956).
After two and a half decades of near dormancy, Snyder and Debono (1985) revived
attitude function matching research (see Debono, 2000 for a review). They proposed that an
individual’s personality could be used to determine which function various attitudes would be
likely to serve. Following Snyder and Debono, other researchers uncovered other methods of
predicting functions based on the attitude objects themselves (Shavitt, 1990) and on situational
cues (Shavitt, Swan, Lowrey, & Wanke, 1994). Despite expansion of research in this area, there

4
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
is some inconsistency across studies as matching functions do not always produce increased
persuasion (e.g. Petty & Wegener, 1998, study 1) and the effectiveness of matching may be
stronger for some functions than others (e.g. Clary et al., 1998). In order to establish an estimate
of the effect size associated with matching versus mismatching, the results of a meta-analysis of
the functional matching effect will be reported.
This meta-analysis makes several contributions to the field of communication. First, the
overall effectiveness of this approach can be determined without the biasing effects of sampling
error and measurement error. Determining the effectiveness of this approach is important as
functional attitude theory is beginning to be used in applied areas such as HIV testing (DuttaBergman, 2003; Hullet, 2006). If functional matching can offer public health campaigners
additional tools for designing campaigns, they need to know what kind of effects to expect in
order to decide among different message strategies.
Additionally, exploring functional attitude theory can contribute to theoretical
understanding of what attitudes are. Functional attitude theory proposes that many attitudes go
beyond simple hedonic motivations. Katz (1960) argued that to build strong attitude theory, a
firm understanding of what attitudes are is required. For example dual-process models of
persuasion had initially conceptualized involvement as based on positive or negative outcomes
but Levin, Nichols, and Johnson (2000) found that there are other types of involvement that
overlap with some of the attitude functions. These alternate types of involvement consistently
produce different persuasion processes that dual-process models cannot account for. If attitude
theory can progress, effectiveness of functional attitude theory as an explanatory mechanism
needs to be established.

5
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
First the typology of the five functions formed by combining the list proposed by Smith
et al. (1956) and Katz (1960) will be reviewed. Then the typical functional matching study will
be described. Finally, the proposed moderators of the functional matching effect will be
discussed.
The Typology of Functions
Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) derived their typologies of attitude functions
independently of each other but both produced a similar list of functions. Although both
suggested the possibility of an attitude serving more than one function, their work generally
discussed each attitude as serving a single function (for conceptual work on conceiving of each
function as a continuous variable see Herek, 1986). Smith et al. were trying to understand the
structure of opinions and personality whereas Katz was attempting to use his typology to tailor
persuasive messages. Given Katz’s focus on persuasion, his labels for the attitude functions will
be maintained here. The Smith et al. label for the social-adjustive function will be used because it
was unique to their typology.
First, both Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) described a utilitarian function for
attitudes. Attitudes that serve a utilitarian function are those that help an individual remember
which objects bring pleasure and which bring pain. Utilitarian attitudes help people know which
objects to approach and which to avoid. These attitudes help people reach their individual goals
and desires. For example, if Erin was out shopping for clothes and her attitude towards shoes
served a primarily utilitarian function, messages from a salesperson concerning the durability of
a pair of shoes, the comfort they provided, or perhaps the ability of the shoes to repel water
during a rainstorm would be persuasive to her.

6
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
Smith et al (1956) described a social-adjustive function such that attitudes serving this
function are held in order to help one impress socially desirable others or groups. People possess
such attitudes so that the expression of those attitudes will help them fit in or gain social
standing. If Mike had social-adjustive attitudes towards shoes, a functional matching approach
would suggest that a sales clerk wishing to sell Mike a pair of shoes would profit by emphasizing
how popular the shoes are and how many people will think Mike looks attractive while wearing
those shoes.
A value-expressive attitude, on the other hand, does not necessarily help people fit in.
Instead, a value-expressive attitude helps people articulate their unique values (Katz, 1960). If
someone’s attitudes serve a value-expressive function, she or he has the attitude in order to be
consistent with her or his values. People do not derive any concrete benefits from valueexpressive attitude like they do from attitudes serving a utilitarian function. At most, people gain
a sense of satisfaction from being true to their values. If a salesperson wanted to sell Allison a
pair of shoes and Allison held shoe attitudes that were value-expressive, the salesperson would
have to find out what kinds of values Allison has and target them. For example, Allison might
have strongly held values such that child labor is morally wrong so the salesperson would have
to persuade Allison that a pair of shoes was not made by child labor. This case illustrates an
important point about value-expressive attitudes. A persuasive agent must not only know that the
attitude of their target is value-expressive, she or he must also know which value the attitude
serves in order to tailor a message for their target (Maio & Olson, 2000).
Rooted in Freudian psychology, Katz (1960) argued that some attitudes serve an egodefensive function such that they protect one’s self-esteem from threats. Threats to one’s selfesteem can come from insults from others, one’s own personal moral failings, having lower

7
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
social status than one thinks one deserves, etc. These attitudes may often serve as a
rationalization for some undesirable behavior or belief. Katz argued that people who held
negative attitudes towards minority groups did so in order to maintain an inflated sense of
superiority. Katz et al. (1956) attempted to change such attitudes by providing such people with
information that attempted to instill a sense of self-insight into their bigotry. In the shoe buying
scenario, if Josh developed a positive attitude towards an expensive pair of shoes to make up for
being passed over for a promotion or for perceived physical inadequacies, his attitude would be
ego-defensive. A clerk trying to tailor his sales pitch to Josh might emphasize how big and
powerful he looked in a pair of shoes.
Finally, there is the knowledge function, which was unique to Katz’s (1960) typology.
Attitudes that serve a knowledge function help people make sense of the world and give them a
greater understanding of their environment apart from any concrete rewards. Attitudes towards
issues and situations that have little bearing on one’s own life such as an American who is
interested in the political candidates in an election in Kazakhstan might serve this function. If
Neala developed an interest in the shoe industry based on its history, then her attitude towards
particular shoes could serve a purely knowledge function. Katz argued that to change such
attitudes, one simply needed to show someone how their attitude was inaccurate and they would
change their attitude to make her or his view of the world more complete.
Now that the five functions have been reviewed, the functional matching literature will be
discussed. The attitude function that is targeted and the way the function is identified (e.g.
induced, measured, based on personality, etc.) will be proposed as potential moderators. Finally,
a meta-analysis will be described that tested the difference in message persuasiveness when an

8
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
attitude’s function is matched with a persuasive message targeting that function or mismatched
with one that does not.
Functional Matching Studies
The typical functional matching study follows the basic methodology laid out by Snyder
and Debono (1985). First, for each participant in the study, the attitude function associated with
an attitude towards a focal object is identified. Snyder and Debono’s method of identifying
attitude functions has become the most popular. They administered the self-monitoring scale in
advance of exposure to the persuasive messages. If the participant was high in self-monitoring,
their attitudes were assumed to be associated with the social-adjustive function because high
self-monitors have a strong desire to please others and integrate into their social group. If the
participant was low in self-monitoring, their attitude was deemed value-expressive as low selfmonitors tend to focus on their own needs and values. The participants were then randomly
assigned to a persuasive message that either targets the social-adjustive function or the valueexpressive function. When high self-monitors received a message targeted at the social-adjustive
function, the message was thought to be a functional match. When high self-monitors received a
message targeting the value-expressive function, the message was thought to be mis-matched.
The reverse was predicted for low self-monitors. If the matched conditions produced a higher
score on a post-message attitude measure than the mismatched conditions, the evidence was
considered to be consistent with the functional matching effect.
Potential Moderators
The first potential moderator to be discussed is the attitude function targeted. The socialadjustive function has been the most studied and has consistently been associated with strong
effects (e.g. Shavitt, 1990; Snyder & Debono, 1985). On the other hand, efforts to target other

9
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
functions have been inconsistently successful. Debono and Harnish (1988) failed to increase the
persuasiveness of a message by matching a utilitarian appeal to that function. The problem with
understanding these findings is that it is uncertain whether it is the ability of persuasion scholars
to effectively write messages targeted at particular functions or if it is the theory itself that is
lacking. In either case, demonstrating that the average effect size for targeting particular
functions is lower than others will point to functions that require additional research.
Additionally, there have been several methods used to identify which function an
individual’s attitudes toward a particular attitude object serve. Snyder and Debono (1985) used
scores on self-monitoring scales to determine which function an attitude serves and their method
has remained the most commonly used. Shavitt (1990) found that the object itself may
sometimes be consistently associated with a particular function regardless of the individual’s
personality. For example, Shavitt proposed that aspirin is solely associated with the utilitarian
function. These various means of assigning attitude functions for the purposes of matching
persuasive messages may be differentially effective and this meta-analysis will report the extent
to which the method of assigning functions moderates the effectiveness of functional matching.
If one means of identifying functions is stronger than another, it would assist researchers
attempting to employ the functional matching effect.
The Meta-analysis
This meta-analysis collected all of the available studies that have tested the functional
matching effect. Specifically, the effect size will be reported for the increase in persuasiveness
caused by matching a persuasive message concerning an attitude object to the function of that
attitude for the recipient of that message as opposed to sending a message that targets a different
function. As there is no theory to make predictions about the effect of the proposed moderators,

10
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
this research may be considered exploratory. By identifying which functions have been targeted
successfully and the methods that have been the most successful in targeting them, this metaanalysis will help point the way towards future work that may develop a more complete account
of the functional matching effect.
Method
Literature Search
The academic search engines “PsycINFO” and “Communication and Mass Media
Complete” were searched using various permutations of “attitude,” “function,” “purposes” and
“uses” such as “functional attitude” and “attitude functions.” Any article that mentioned attitude
functions was examined for possible inclusion. The references section of all obtained articles and
relevant review articles were also combed for more studies. The first authors on the obtained
articles were all contacted and asked for unpublished articles.
Study Selection
In order to be included in this meta-analysis, several criteria had to be met. First, each
study must have used some means of determining the extent to which a message was matched or
mismatched to its function and measured the effectiveness of matching versus mismatching on
post message exposure attitudes or a similar construct. The article must have used this
methodology to test functional attitude theory. There are many persuasion studies that targeted
values or used utilitarian appeals but the goal of this review is to examine the effectiveness of
targeting persuasive messages with functional attitude theory as a guide. Second, a study must
have reported enough information in the article to derive an effect size estimate. For example,
Clary et al. (1998) was not included because that article only reported regression weights, which
are unable to be converted into a standardized effect size that is comparable across studies

11
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
(Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). Based on these criteria, 16 articles were obtained and 38 effect size
estimates were derived. The total sample was 1,460 participants.
Coding
For each effect size, several aspects were recorded (see Table 1 for all of the information
recorded for each effect size estimate). The sample size, the reliability information of the
dependent variable (if available), the function targeted, and the method of predicting the
functions were recorded for each effect size. Based on information in the articles, effect size
estimates using the correlation coefficient were calculated and recorded. The effect size was
based on the pairwise comparison between the persuasiveness of a message targeting a particular
function when the recipient of that message was believed to possess the targeted function as
compared to when the recipient possessed a different function. For studies that included an
argument strength induction, only the strong argument conditions were used as it is typical to use
persuasive arguments in this literature rather than weak arguments. Several studies reported the
matching effect for more than one function at a time and the effect sizes for targeting each
function could not be estimated. These studies were included in the overall effect size estimate
but they could not be used for moderator analysis based on the type of function targeted.
Coding for the function targeted was conducted by examining the message and
identifying which function it was most closely associated with as there have been conflicting
interpretations of what functions were targeted in some of the self-monitoring studies (Shavitt,
Lowrey, & Han, 1992). There were nine effect sizes from studies that targeted the utilitarian
function, fifteen targeted the social-adjustive function, eight targeted the value-expressive
function, one targeted the knowledge function, and none targeted the ego-defensive function.
Two studies targeted each of the five functions but only reported an average of the effectiveness

12
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
of functional matching across all the functions. An additional two targeted either the utilitarian or
social-adjustive function but did not report the results separately with sufficient detail to estimate
the effectiveness of functional matching for each.
The majority (29) of the effect sizes were based on studies that estimated the functions of
their participants by measuring self-monitoring. These studies targeted messages at high selfmonitoring individuals that were based on appeals to a socially-adjustive function and targeted
low self-monitoring individuals with either value-expressive or utilitarian appeals. Four effect
sizes were calculated from studies that measured which function the attitude served directly, two
predicted functions based on the attitude object itself, two induced particular functions by
frustrating the motivations associated with them, and one used scores on a measure of otherdirectedness such that higher scores were associated with a social-adjustment function.
Data-analysis
In order to estimate the mean weighted effect size and determine the amount of variance
in the population correlation, the variance-centered method of meta-analysis described by Hunter
and Schmidt (2004) was used. The Hunter and Schmidt method is preferred because it is the
most common meta-analysis method in communication research (Anker, Reinhart, & Feeley,
2010). Each correlation was weighted by its sample size in order to create the most accurate
estimate of the population effect size. Furthermore, an estimate of the homogeneity of the effect
was obtained by determining what percentage of variance was explained by sampling error and
other artifacts. Hunter and Schmidt argue that if 75% or more of the variance in the correlations
can be attributed to sampling error and other artifacts, the effect is likely to be homogeneous
(otherwise known as a fixed effects estimate). If, however, less than 75% of the variance can be
explained, the effect size estimate is deemed heterogeneous (also called a random effects

13
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
estimate) and an 80% credibility interval is constructed to estimate how widely the population
effect size is predicted to vary based on undetected moderators of the effect. If the effect is
heterogeneous, but the credibility interval is not very wide, undetected moderators may be
unimportant as they would be unlikely to change the interpretation of the effect size. On the
other hand, if the credibility intervals are wide, there may be occasions when moderators cause
the effect to disappear or even reverse if the credibility interval includes values below zero.
Confidence intervals and statistical significance tests were not calculated as they are often
inaccurate and misleading in the case of a meta-analysis (Hunter & Schmidt, 2000). Because
reporting of reliability information in the measure of the dependent variable was inconsistent,
Hunter and Schmidt’s (2004) artifact distribution method was used to correct for measurement
error. This method uses an average of the reported reliabilities to correct for measurement error.
Results
Across studies, the sample size weighted mean effect size was r = .37, with an 80%
credibility interval of.19 < ρ < .55. Sampling error and measurement error accounted for only
61% of the variance, which indicates the presence of moderators as it is below the 75% rule
cutoff (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). The credibility interval does not include zero, which indicates
that the functional matching effect will almost always produce a positive effect when sampling
and measurement error are accounted for despite the presence of moderators. Moderators may
make the effect smaller, but they are unlikely to cause the effect to disappear or be reversed.
Next, the effect of the proposed moderators on the effect size will be examined. The nine
effect sizes from studies that tested the effect of matching the utilitarian function almost formed
a homogeneous set with 67% of the variance explained by sampling and measurement error (N =

14
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
257). The sample size weighted effect, r = .40, was only trivially larger than the average effect
across all functions. The 80% credibility interval was .20 < ρ < .57.
The fifteen effect sizes from studies that examined the effect of matching the socialadjustive function also produced a homogeneous set as 100% of the variance was explained by
sampling and measurement error (N = 513). The sample size weighted effect (r = .38) was again
only trivially larger than the total average effect and similar to the effect for targeting the
utilitarian function.
Eight effect sizes were extracted from studies targeting the value-expressive function and
the effect was homogeneous as 75% of the variance was accounted for by sampling and
measurement error (N = 354). The 80% credibility interval was .22 < ρ < .47 around a sample
size weighted mean of r = .35. This effect size is not substantially lower than the utilitarian or
socially-adjustive functions. The credibility interval suggests that there are occasions when
targeting the value-expressive function may be somewhat more effective than the socialadjustive functions but that there may also be occasions such that targeting the value-expressive
function will be substantially less effective. Only one study reported a useable independent test
of the knowledge function and none reported a functional matching test of the ego-defensive
function.
Finally, 29 of the effect sizes calculated for this meta-analysis used scores on the selfmonitoring scale to assign attitude functions (N = 902). For this set of studies, the sample size
weighted average effect size was r = .31, slightly smaller than the overall average. Sampling
error and measurement error accounted for 83% of the variance so application of the 75% rule
would suggest that the estimate is probably homogeneous. The 80% credibility interval was .20
< ρ < .43. No other method of estimating attitude functions was tested with enough studies to

15
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
produce a meaningful meta-analytic estimate. Therefore the only method of estimating functions
that could be tested as a moderator was the use of self-monitoring scores to predict attitude
functions.
The n-r correlation suggested by Levine, Asada, and Carpenter (2009) was used to test
the possibility that there are unpublished findings that were suppressed due to their failure to
detect a statistically significant effect. This problem is known as publication bias. The correlation
between the sample sizes for each study and the absolute value of the effect size for each study
was r = -.16, which suggests only a small amount of publication bias. The trim-and-fill algorithm
was used to estimate how many studies were likely to be missing from the meta-analysis due to
bias against studies that do not find statistically significant effects (Duval, 2005; Duval and
Tweedie, 2000). The trim-and-fill analysis found that, given the obtained distribution of the
studies, there were likely to be zero unpublished studies on this relationship. It is unlikely that
the overall effect size is biased by the absence of unpublished studies.
Discussion
The most important finding produced by this meta-analysis is the large effect size for
matching attitudes to functions. The mean effect size was r = .37, which is larger than the effect
size for inoculation theory’s predictions (r = .21; Banas & Rains, 2010). This effect is also larger
than the increase in persuasiveness for strong arguments when processed by those with high
involvement rather than low involvement as per the elaboration likelihood model (r = .21;
Johnson & Eagly, 1989). It was also larger than the decrease in persuasiveness for weak
arguments when processed by those with high involvement rather than low involvement that the
elaboration likelihood model predicted (r = .11; Johnson & Eagly). Finally, the functional
matching effect is larger than the effect associated with counter-attitudinal advocacy as predicted

16
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
by cognitive dissonance theory (r = .23; Preiss, Allen, Peterson, & Gayle, 2006). It should be
noted that the credibility interval does include some of these other effect sizes so it remains to be
seen when the functional matching effect is as strong of a predictor of persuasion as these other
theories and when it is substantially stronger. As functional attitude matching may often produce
stronger effects than employing inoculation theory, cognitive dissonance, and the elaboration
likelihood model, it seems to be a theory worthy of additional research.
Several of the moderators that were tested did reduce the heterogeneity of variance in the
effect size estimate, but their estimates of the overall effect did not generally differ substantially
from each other. The credibility intervals for targeting the utilitarian and the value-expressive
functions suggest that undetected moderators may cause these effect sizes to be both stronger and
weaker than the effect size for targeting the socially adjustive function. It is uncertain why the
utilitarian function might vary so much but perhaps the higher variance in effect sizes detected
for targeting the value-expressive function lies in the variety of values that might drive an
attitude when the attitude is held for the purpose of expressing values (Maio & Olson, 2000b).
Methods that identify an attitude’s function as value-expressive need to be supplemented with
methods that identify the particular value that is being expressed. Hullet (2002, 2004, 2006) has
had some success with modeling the processes associated with the value-expressive function in a
health communication context by targeting specific values. Future research in this area would be
helpful to determine the most effective ways to target value-expressive attitudes.
The use of the self-monitoring scale to target attitude functions (Snyder & Debono, 1985)
was the most commonly used method for demonstrating the functional matching effect. The
moderator analysis found that the studies using this technique as a group produced an effect size
estimate that was somewhat smaller than the overall average effect size. Although this method of

17
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
targeting functions has been widely used, research using other methods would be a profitable
approach for several reasons. First, it is clear that there is plenty of research demonstrating this
use of the self-monitoring scale so the need for further replications is dubious. Second, it remains
uncertain if those who are low in self-monitoring possess attitudes that are value-expressive or
utilitarian (Shavitt et al., 1992). Finally, the self-monitoring scale itself may lack validity (Dillard
& Hunter, 1989). Julka and Marsh (2005) induced particular functions by frustrating them and
found some of the largest matching effects in this corpus of studies. Clearly, methods other than
the use of the self-monitoring scale are needed to make progress in understanding the functional
matching effect.
Limitations
In general, this meta-analysis is limited because of the lack of additional primary studies.
The small size of the meta-analysis limits the confidence one can place in its estimates. One of
the most disappointing aspects of this corpus of studies was the lack of specific tests of the
functional matching effect for the ego-defensive and knowledge functions (see Julka & Marsh,
2005 for an exception). Katz and colleagues (Katz et al., 1957; Katz et al., 1956) found mixed
success with attempting to target the ego-defensive function using a variety of measures of
personality thought to be associated with this function. More recently, Lapinski and Boster
(2001) were able to effectively model the processes by which ego-defensive resistance to
persuasion occurs. Further work is needed to understand the best means and the effectiveness of
targeting the ego-defensive function.
Additionally, this body of studies may be producing an unrealistically high estimate of
the effectiveness of functional matching by using the mismatched message as the comparison
group. In order to truly demonstrate the effectiveness of functional matching, researchers might

18
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
compare the effectiveness of the message when it is matched to only those who are a priori
identified as possessing attitudes matching that function versus a group whose functions have not
been identified at all. By comparing a matched message to the effectiveness of the message on a
group of random people, the strength of tailoring the message to the audience can be assessed.
This kind of research would help persuasion professionals decide if tailoring based on attitude
functions is worth the difficulty associated with a priori identifying attitude functions.
Another limitation of this meta-analysis is its inability to distinguish among the various
theoretical explanations for the functional matching effect due to a dearth of studies performing
critical tests. Within the elaboration likelihood model framework (Petty & Wegener, 1998)
several explanations have been proposed including the argument that functional matching acts as
a peripheral cue (Snyder & Debono, 1985) and the argument that functional matching increases
the depth of processing (Debono & Harnish, 1988). Opposed to the elaboration likelihood model
perspective, advocates of the unimodel (Thompson, Kruglanski, & Spiegel, 2000) have proposed
that functional matching increases the relevance of the information to the conclusions for the
audience. More research is required in order to clarify the processes involved in the functional
matching effect.
Conclusion
Although this meta-analysis is limited by the need for more primary research, it does
demonstrate the power that functional matching can have. Although this branch of persuasion
theory was under-researched in Katz’s (1960) day, his prediction that functional matching would
substantially increase our ability to persuade audiences has been verified by the growing body of
research finding large effects consistent with his prediction. Despite the age of this approach,

19
FUNCTIONAL ATTITUDE THEORY
much research remains undone. Yet, if this meta-analysis is any indication, it is a fruitful avenue
to explore.

Note: The abbreviations for the Function column are “util” = utilitarian, “social” = socialadjustive, “value” = value-expressive, “know” = knowledge, “all” all functions were tested
together. The abbreviations for the Type column refer to how the functions were assigned and
are “SM” = self-monitoring scale, “measured” = measured the attitude functions directly, “other”
= measured other-directedness as an indicator of social-adjustive attitudes, “induced” =
frustrated each attitude to induce a motivation for that function, “object” = assigned functions
based on the attitude objects themselves.
