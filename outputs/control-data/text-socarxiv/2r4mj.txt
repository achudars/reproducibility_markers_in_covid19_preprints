Foreword
Over the last ten years the sharing of nude images or videos by young people has emerged
as a concern. We were therefore surprised to find that in New Zealand, no research had been
conducted on the prevalence of the sharing of nudes among young New Zealanders. This
study addresses this and raises important questions for all those with a role in supporting
young people’s healthy development.
On one hand, the findings are reassuring. They challenge preconceptions we may hold about
young people’s behaviour and attitudes. On the other, they suggest young people find
themselves part of a culture of sharing nudes whether they like it or not. It also highlights how
different groups of teens experience the sharing of nudes; including by gender, ethnicity and
disability.
We believe this report makes an important contribution to the overall understanding of young
people’s experience of these behaviours. However, it only provides a snapshot, and more
work is required to understand how best to support young people as they navigate the
challenges and potential risks. The imperative comes from the majority of young people that
indicate their concern about the outcomes and impact of these behaviours.
This report is being released as part of a larger project exploring young people’s experiences
of digital risk and harm, carried out by a partnership between Netsafe and the Ministry for
Women. We deeply value the contribution of the Ministry for Women team whose
encouragement and insights have helped shaped this study.
We would also like to acknowledge the input of our international partners, the Office of the
eSafety Commissioner (Australia), the UK Safer Internet Centre and University of Plymouth
(UK). This collaboration has enabled the comparison of young people’s experiences in New
Zealand, Australia and the UK, published in a separate report.

Executive Summary
The purpose of this report is to present the findings of the first quantitative study conducted
in New Zealand about the sending, receiving, and requesting of nude or nearly nude images
or videos through digital technology by young people. The study focused on teens aged 14-17
years old. Currently, public attention centres on the potential risks faced by young people
sharing nude content online, and the apparent pervasiveness of this behaviour. However,
statistical evidence explaining its extent among young people is non-existent. Arguably, this
lack of reliable research about sexting contributes to the sense of alarmism in media
coverage of the topic. This study helps to address this by undertaking a survey-based
research project that collected data from a representative sample of New Zealand teens.
The sharing of nudes, commonly referred as “sexting”, is a complex and evolving behaviour.
The rapid-changing nature of digital technologies is reflected in the ways people have
adopted and adapted these tools for their everyday life activities. What started in the early to
mid-2000s as the sending of explicit text-only phone messages has evolved to the sharing of
mostly images and videos of nude content through different digital tools and platforms. Thus,
the term “sexting” does not capture the scope of context and motivations surrounding these
behaviours. This report uses variations of the term “sharing of nude content” defined in the
following way:

Any act or practice related to sending, receiving, requesting or being
asked for mostly, but not always, self-generated nude or nearly nude
images or video through digital tools and/or platforms. Such behaviour
may arise for a range of reasons and contexts (e.g., consensual or nonconsensual creation or sharing, relationship building, sexual selfexploration, volunteering an image, being asked for one, peer
pressure, flirting, sexual exploration, coercion or extortion of content,
intimidation and other abuse).
Two specific objectives guided the study. The first objective was to gain an understanding of
the prevalence and extent of sharing of nudes among teens aged 14-17 years old. Second, the
study sought to identify differences in terms of gender, age, disability, and ethnic groups.
The results of the study provide significant insights into New Zealand teens’ experiences of
the sharing of nudes. Strikingly, young people perceive that sharing nudes is a more common
practice than it actually is. The findings also reveal some relevant differences in terms of
gender, ethnicity, disability, and age groups. In some cases, these differences seem not only
to confirm, but also to challenge, previous assumptions about teens’ experiences and
behaviours regarding the sharing of nude content. For example, the findings indicate a
majority of young people are questioning these behaviours, and do so on the basis of an
understanding of the motivations behind them. The findings suggest that teens find
themselves part of a culture of sharing nudes; whether they are active, passive or peripheral
participants.
These findings should provide government agencies, NGOs and service providers, educators,
and researchers with a useful source of evidence to guide future research and inform policy
discussion and interventions aimed at educating young people, and supporting their healthy
development into adulthood.

Key findings
•

4% of teens say they have sent nude or nearly nude content of themselves in the last
12 months. The percentage nearly doubles among older teens aged 17 years old (7%).

•

1 in 5 have been asked for nude or nearly nude images of themselves in the last year.

•

Nearly a quarter of all girls (24%) surveyed have been asked for nude images of
themselves in the last 12 months compared to boys (14%). The percentage of those
receiving unsolicited nude content in the last 12 months is slightly higher in girls
compared to boys as well.

•

5% of all boys surveyed have asked someone for nude images or videos of them. In
contrast, the percentage for girls is 2% in the last 12 months.

•

For Māori and Pacific teens it is more common to be asked for nude content of
themselves than other ethnic groups.

•

Nearly 1 in 4 Māori teens have received unsolicited nude or nearly nude content. This
figure is higher than NZ European/Pakeha and Pacific teens.

•

Teens with disabilities were more likely to be asked for nude content of themselves
and receive unsolicited nude content than those without impairments.

•

Almost 4 in 10 say they know someone who has shared nude pictures or videos with
someone else at some point in the past.

•

About half of those who have personally experienced or know someone involved in
the sharing of nude content say this happens ‘often or very often’. Perceptions are
higher among female respondents, and Pacific teens.

•

Almost 3 in 10 are aware of someone else who has received nude or nearly nude
content they did not ask for, and almost a quarter are aware of someone being asked
for nude or nearly nude content of themselves.

•

Almost three-quarters agree that people should be punished for threatening to share
images while a third think that available information and advice tackles issues related
to the sharing of nude content well.

•

The majority disagreed with the following statements:
o
o
o
o

•

Adults overreact about the sharing of nudes;
Sharing nudes is a good way to explore things about yourself;
It is OK to keep nudes that have been sent to you long after you received
them; and
Sharing nudes is not a problem because everyone does it.

Views are mixed on the degree of pressure to send nude content. Just over half of
young people (54%) think that nude images or videos are sent by their peers to seek
attention, gain social approval, or because of peer pressure. While views are mixed on
the degree of pressure to send these types of images, females are more likely to
report such pressure than males.

Summary
The finding that around 1 in 20 teens have shared a nude of themselves in the last year
suggests a difference between public perception and the reality. Simply, while many teens
feel a lot pressure to share nudes, it does not automatically follow that they do. This reflects
international experience, and should help to debunk any idea that “everybody is doing it”.
However, when the definition of behaviours or the timeframe asked about is expanded, the
number of young people reporting involvement increases. This suggests that while young
people sharing nudes of themselves is not standard behaviour it is common enough to have
entered the culture.
Young people understand these behaviours happen as part of growing up as a person. In
their view, it is a forming identity, sexual exploration and building trust in a relationship.
However, they consider other factors, such as peer pressure, explain this behaviour too. They
are aware of the risks and most of them think that a young person is responsible for what they
do online. Their attitudes to sharing nudes suggests they generally do not like the practice.
However, some teens don’t see sharing nudes as a problem, arguing that if adults can do it,
they can too.
Not all young New Zealanders have the same experiences with these behaviours; with
differences between ages, genders, ethnicities and those with a long-term disability. Among
those who have sent a picture of themselves in the last 12 months, older teens are more
active than younger. New Zealand girls are more likely than boys to be the target of requests
for their nudes, or receiving them from other people without request. This finding reflects
international research and confirms gender is an important element in explaining this
behaviour. This study also revealed some significant characteristics in experiences based on
participants’ ethnicity; and those with a disability. Both groups are more likely to be asked for
nudes of themselves, and receive unsolicited nudes, compared to others their age.
While the findings are representative of 14-17 year olds, they only provide a snapshot of their
experiences. Further research into how they navigate risks and deal with potential harm
caused by this behaviour is needed; and to explore the relationship between sharing nude
content and other digital challenges such as online bullying, harassment, and sexual violence
and abuse.

Introduction
This report on the sharing of nude or nearly nude images and videos among New Zealand
teens is part of a larger project exploring young people’s experiences of digital risk and harm
carried out by Netsafe in partnership with the Ministry for Women. Preliminary findings,
comparing New Zealand’s experience with those of Australia and the UK, were presented
along with figures from the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and UK Safer Internet Centre
at the Online Safety on the Edge conference in Sydney Australia in November 2017.
Netsafe’s extensive operational experience dealing with cases of non-consensual sharing of
nude content and related other digital challenges, and international research (Ringrose, Gill,
Livingstone, & Harvey, 2012) show that the term sexting is misused and can be misleading.
Teens do not use the term sexting to describe the different dimensions of this behaviour;
instead they use words such as “nudes”, “nudies”, “dick pics”, and “naked pics” to describe
their experiences. It is important to take this into account if we are to develop research and
policy that reflects young people’s needs and worldview, and to help narrow the gap
between adults’ perceptions and young people’s experiences of this phenomenon.
Therefore, in this report we limit the use of the term sexting, preferring “sharing of nudes” as
shorthand for the broad range of behaviours related to sending, receiving and requesting of
nude or nearly nude images and videos.
This section presents an overview of current research and issues around the sharing of nude
content overseas and in New Zealand. The focus is on studies that have attempted to
measure the prevalence as this reflects the type of study conducted by Netsafe. Then, it
describes the research methodology applied in the study including sample characteristics,
and matters related to ethics and limitations of the project.

Background
The expression “sex messaging” emerged in the media in early 2000s to describe a new
form of technology-mediated behaviour involving the exchange of explicit messages (Vogels,
2004). Initially limited to text-only messages sent via Short Message Systems or SMS (Albury,
Funnell, & Noonan, 2010), technology rapidly evolved to allow the creation and sharing of
visual content such as images and videos. As more people have access to a range of digital
technologies and the capacity of devices to store and transfer large amounts of data in varied
electronic formats has increased, the sharing of explicit content has evolved to refer to the
electronic transfer of nude and/or nearly nude images or videos via mobile phones and other
digital means. Nowadays, not only media outlets but also researchers use the term “sexting”
to describe this behaviour.
While public interest in the sharing of nudes has increased, particularly among parents,
educators, and law enforcement officials (Lounsbury, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2011), two
competing approaches have emerged to explain the so-called sexting phenomenon
(Kosenko, Luurs, & Binder, 2017). On the one hand, the sharing of nude content is seen as a
high-risk behaviour that requires intervention and prevention, especially through education.
Some argue this behaviour deserves greater policy consideration (Nash et al., 2015) and,
reflecting this call to action, in some countries legal remedies have been adopted to sanction
it (Crofts, Lee, McGovern, & Milivojevic, 2016). On the other hand, the sharing of nudes is

9 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

understood as a normal practice of intimate communication taking place mainly within
romantic and sexual relationships (Döring, 2014). While the former explanation has dominated
research and discussion, the latter is gaining space within the research community (Kosenko
et al., 2017).
Research on the sharing of nudes has mainly relied on surveys to measure its prevalence. A
review of 31 quantitative studies on the topic, for instance, found that the sharing of nude
content is more frequent amongst adults than adolescents, that older age is predictive of
sexting for adolescents but not adults, and that more individuals report receiving this type of
content than sending it (Klettke, Hallford, & Mellor, 2014). However, studying the prevalence
of this behaviour can be challenging. Recently, researchers have pointed out that sexting, as
a concept, has been operationalised differently across studies (Drouin, Vogel, Surbey, & Stills,
2013), meaning that it is hard to make comparisons across studies. Another challenge is that
differing research methodologies are used, especially regarding sample selection, making it
difficult to compare young people’s engagement with the sharing of nudes (Temple et al.,
2012).
One of the first nationally representative studies on sexting was conducted by the Pew
Research Center in the USA (Lenhart, 2009). The study, a telephone survey, focused on teens
aged 12-17 years old. The survey asked about the sending and receiving of nude or nearly
nude images or videos via mobile phones, excluding text-only messages, and the use of
email or online social networks. The study found that 4% of respondents had sent nude or
nearly nude images of themselves to someone else, and 15% of participants said they had
received images of someone they knew. In terms of comparing age groups, the study found
that older teens were more likely to send and/or receive sexting-related content. The study
also highlighted that teens paying their own mobile phone bills were more likely to be
involved in some form of sharing practice, with 17% of those surveyed saying they sent nude
or nearly nude content. In contrast, 3% of teens who did not pay for, or only paid for a portion
of the cost of their mobile phones, sent these type of images (Lenhart, 2009).
A survey-based study conducted in the UK also explored online experiences and risks,
including sexting, among children and teens aged 11-16 years old (Livingstone, Haddon,
Görzig, & Ólafsson, 2010). The study found 12% of participants in this age group had seen or
received a sexual message (text, image or video) online, with 2% receiving them more than
once a week. However, sending a sexual message online was a less common practice with
only 4% of participants reporting they had done this. While the evidence from this study
shows that sending nudes was not prevalent, additional research in the UK suggests that
sexting was more frequent among teens in a romantic relationship (Wood, Barter, Stanley,
Aghtaie, & Larkins, 2015). The study reported teens’ experiences of sexting across five
European countries (Bulgaria, Cyprus, England, Italy, and Norway). Survey participants, aged
14-17 years old, were asked if they have ever sent a sexual text message or picture to any of
their partners. The highest proportions of teens taking part in this kind of behaviour were
found in England (38%) and Norway (30%). Bulgaria, Italy and Cyprus followed with 28%, 22%
and 10%, respectively.
In Australia, a national survey of the sexual health of secondary students (Mitchell, Patrick,
Heywood, Blackman, & Pitts, 2013) collected relevant data on sexting. The study combined
paper-based and online surveys to collect data from 2,136 high school students aged 16-18

10 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

years old. The study found that 1 in 4 respondents had sent a sexually explicit nude or nearly
nude picture or video of themselves, and over 40% reported receiving nude content of
someone else. When asked about the use of social media for sexual reasons, over 1 in 5 said
they have used online tools for this purpose, with teenage males’ responses double that of
their female peers. Also, half of all sexually active students reported sending a sexually
explicit nude or nearly nude photo or video of themselves, while 70% reported receiving such
content. The study’s definition of sexting also included sending or receiving sexually explicit
text-only messages. In this respect, the findings revealed that just over 42% and 54% of
respondents had sent or received this type of content, respectively (Mitchell et al., 2013).
While the international body of knowledge is growing, in New Zealand no research has been
conducted on the prevalence of the sharing of nudes among young people. Available
research has focused on technology-mediated challenges and harm. For example, Fenaughty
and Harré (2013) compared the prevalence of mobile phone and internet harassment, and the
level of distress caused by both experiences. Others (see Jose, Kljakovic, Scheib, & Notter,
2012) have looked at the relationship between face-to-face and online bullying as well as
victimhood. A study by Marsh, McGee, Nada-Raja, and Williams (2010) measured the
frequency of different categories of bullying among 15 year old teens, including bullying
through text messages. With no research evidence about the prevalence of the sharing of
nudes, public discussion and reflection on this topic has been guided by anecdotal
information and single cases reported in the media. The findings in this study make a
contribution to closing this gap in evidence by directly considering the question of prevalence
of behaviours related to the sharing of nudes by New Zealand teenagers.
However, as research interest in the topic increases overseas, academics and analysts are
moving towards the study of specific aspects of related behaviours while applying qualitative
and mixed methodologies. The literature, for example, shows that some of these studies
include the role of coercion on sexting practices (Drouin, Ross, & Tobin, 2015), gender
inequities and sexual double standards around the sharing of nudes (Ringrose, Harvey, Gill, &
Livingstone, 2013), sexting practices in the context of teens’ romantic relationships (Wood et
al., 2015) and their relationship with the early sexual activity of teens (Brinkley, Ackerman,
Ehrenreich, & Underwood, 2017). These studies indicate that teens’ experiences of sharing
nudes are not only a relevant research topic but also an issue of public interest and concern.

Methodology
This study adopted a quantitative approach to gain an understanding of the nature and extent
of nude images and videos being shared by, and among, teens aged 14-17 years. Current
analysis and discussion about the phenomenon of sharing nudes is guided by anecdotal
cases reported in the media rather than evidence-based research. As no previous study in
New Zealand has investigated this topic, a quantitative study based on representative data
was the appropriate approach to obtain general characteristics of the prevalence and extent
of this matter.
The research questions that guided this study were:
1.

What is the prevalence and extent of sending, receiving, and requesting nude or
nearly nude images or videos among teens in New Zealand?
2. Are there any differences in terms of gender, age, disability, and ethnic group?

In the following sub-sections, we describe the technique for data collection used for the
study, the characteristics of the research sample, issues related to research ethics, and the
limitations of the study.
SURVEY TOOL
We decided to conduct an online survey. Surveys are useful in providing statistical
descriptions by asking questions about a topic to a specific group of people (Fowler, 2014).
The high internet penetration in New Zealand and the embeddedness of a range of digital
tools and devices in the everyday activities of NZ users, including teens, enable the use of
online surveys as a useful data collection technique for social research (Crothers, Smith,
Urale, & Bell, 2016). In addition, data collected from online surveys can be administered easily
which facilitates analysis and reporting of findings (Wright, 2006).
Netsafe worked on the planning and design of the research instrument. In developing the
questionnaire, we consulted with key partners specifically the Ministry for Women |
Minitatanga mō ngā Wāhine, Australia’s Office of the eSafety Commissioner, the UK Safer
Internet Centre, and the University of Plymouth (UK). We also drew from the extensive
operational experience of Netsafe’s contact centre team in dealing with reported cases
where the sharing of nude content has gone wrong. The questions were cognitive tested and
piloted by Colmar Brunton, NZ and then refined in consultation with partners before going
live. Data collection started at the end of July 2017 and continued for five weeks.
SAMPLE
The study collected data from teens aged 14-17 years old. Colmar Brunton sampled
participants using its online research panel. As children are not panel members, a
representative sample of 30-65 year old adults were asked whether they have children in the
target age group. To provide benchmark data for sampling and weighting, Colmar Brunton
used 2017 population projections for children in the age range. Projections are more useful
than 2013 Census data because the ethnic composition of New Zealand children has
changed significantly since 2013.
A total of 1,001 New Zealand teens completed the online survey. Data collected from this
representative sample allowed the analysis of sub-groups with a margin of error of +/- 3.1% on
total results. Just over half (51%) of respondents were males and 48.7% females, while 0.3%
identified as gender diverse.
In terms of age distribution, 14 and 15 year old participants each represented 24% while 16
and 17 year olds each encompassed 26% of the total sample. In terms of ethnicity, participants
were distributed as follows: NZ European/Pakeha (66%), Māori (24%), Pacific (13%), Asian
(13%), and Other (4%).
15% of participants identified themselves as experiencing a long-term disability related to
sight, hearing, learning, walking, and/or communicating.

RESEARCH ETHICS
Because of the sensitive nature of the study, Colmar Brunton, in discussion with Netsafe,
ensured that participants’ privacy and confidentiality were protected. To this end, the market
research company also followed industry standards including the Research Association’s
Code of Practice. Parental permission was obtained online for all participants at the beginning
of the online survey. The participants and their parents/caregivers received information about
the purpose of the project, the name of the institutions behind the study, and an explanation
about use and protection of the data provided. As mentioned, the questions were cognitive
tested to identify whether there was any risk of causing distress to the respondents. Links to
relevant services were also included in the survey support material. In the parental permission
email we asked parents to allow their children to respond to the survey privately. The email
was also tested and refined during the cognitive interviews and during the first 100 online
survey interviews. In addition, an on-screen warning message recommended respondents to
complete the questions on their own while no-one else was watching the screen.
LIMITATIONS
As previously mentioned, this study is based on a representative sample of New Zealand
teens aged 14-17 years old. The data provides significant statistical evidence about
prevalence, motivations and attitudes to the sharing of nude content online among teens. It
does not provide a full picture of the different and complex dimensions and contexts
surrounding these behaviours. Personal experiences and views of New Zealand teens need
to be explored in more detail through other methodological approaches. It is anticipated that
the insights from this study will provide a valuable source of information for researchers
seeking to build the knowledge base around this topic.
In addition, 30% of participants completed the online survey with a parent/caregiver close to
them. This occurred despite asking parents to allow their children to respond to the survey
privately. A potential limitation to the study is that results could be skewed as some teens
may have felt embarrassed to admit that they have sent/received nude or nearly nude
content online. However, this is not a surprise as similar percentages have been reported in
other studies asking personal questions to young people.

Findings
This section describes the key findings from the online survey. It presents insights about the
prevalence and extent of sharing nudes among New Zealand teens. It also describes relevant
differences in terms of gender, age, disability, and ethnic group. In addition to the
measurement of the prevalence of these behaviours, this section provides insights into
participants’ views of them.

Knowledge of others ever having shared nude pictures or
videos
To start with, the respondents were asked whether they know anyone who has ever shared
nude or nearly nude pictures of videos with someone. As Figure 1 shows, 39% (nearly 1 in 4)
responded ‘Yes’ compared to 61% of those who answered ‘No’.

A closer look at the results in terms of gender shows that the percentage of female teenagers
who responded ‘Yes’ was higher than that of their male peers. In this respect, 45% of girls
said they know someone who has ever shared nude or nearly nude pictures of videos,
compared to 33% of boys (see Figure 2).

The findings also provide relevant insights in terms of age (see Table 1). Compared with their
younger peers, a relatively higher proportion of older New Zealand teens, those aged 16 or 17

years old (30%) were less likely to know someone involved in this kind of practice.

We also wanted to measure the perceived frequency of sharing nudes among New Zealand
teens. Those respondents who have personally experienced or are aware of someone who
has dealt with the issue (n=522) were asked the following question: In general, how often do
people your age do these kinds of things? A sum of responses shows that about half of the
group of participants perceived that sharing nudes occurs ‘Often’ (36%) or ‘Very often’ (13%).
On the other hand, those who answered ‘Sometimes’ and ‘Rarely’ represented 37% and 14%,
respectively (see Figure 3). A total of 86% replied at least ‘Sometimes’.

However, differences can be found when the findings are compared in terms of gender
(Figure 4). Female teens perceived that sharing nudes is an issue that occurs more often.
Specifically, most female respondents said that the sharing of nudes happens ‘Often’ (41%) or
‘Very often’ (14%). In contrast, a lower percentage of young males considered that this kind of
online practice occurs ‘Often’ (30%) or ‘Very often’ (11%).

In terms of ethnicity, the findings show that a significant percentage of Pacific teens reported
that they think the sharing of nudes occurs ‘Often’ or ‘Very often’: 63% of Pacific teens
responded in this way (Table 2). They were followed by Māori teens (58%). Still significant but
at a lower percentage was the result from those within the group NZ European/Pakeha (51%).

Personal experience of sharing nudes in the past 12 months
As shown in Figure 5, we asked participants a set of questions regarding their individual
experiences with different aspects of sharing nude content in the last year. As previously
explained, we define the sharing of nude content as encompassing a number practices and
behaviours that are not limited to people creating and sending explicit content of themselves
through digital platforms and tools but also include requesting and distributing explicit
content that they might not necessarily have created. The survey data show some relevant
insights on this matter.
A surprising finding reveals a large majority of New Zealand teens are not actively engaged in
the sharing of nudes. Specifically, when asked if they have sent a nude or nearly nude picture
or video of themselves, 96% of participants responded ‘No’ while the remaining 4% reported
to have sent content of themselves. This finding contrasts with the perceived prevalence of
sharing nude content among young people previously described in this report.
A closer look at the data in terms of age shows that 7% of older teens (17 year olds) have sent
nude images or videos of themselves in the last 12 months. This percentage is higher
compared to 14 year olds (1%), 15 year olds (4%), and 16 year olds (3%). While there is public
concern about younger children sending such content of themselves, our data does not show
they have a higher level of involvement in this behaviour compared with their older peers. On
the other hand, nearly 1 in 5 responded that they have been asked for nude or nearly nude
images or videos of themselves (19%). The data also show a similar percentage regarding
receiving unsolicited content. In this respect, in the last 12 months 18% of participants said that
they had received nude or nearly nude images or videos they did not ask for.
We also asked respondents whether they have shown from their device nude or nearly nude
content to someone else. 7% responded ‘Yes”. Other questions about aspects of sharing
nudes included asking whether the participants have been asked for nude or nearly nude

17 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

of someone else (3%); and whether they have asked someone for nude or nearly nude

Base: All respondents excluding refusals.

A closer look at the data regarding teens’ personal experiences with the sharing of nudes
reveals some relevant gendered differences (Table 3). For example, more female participants
(24%) reported being asked for nude or nearly nude images or videos of themselves in the
past 12 months than their male peers (14%). A similar trend was found in terms of receiving
unsolicited nude or nearly nude content, with 20% of female participants reporting receiving
content they did not ask for, compared to 17% of male respondents.
As previously shown, overall the percentage of all teens who asked someone for nudes or
nearly nudes of them was around 4%. However, a gender comparison shows that more boys
(5%) requested nudes than girls (2%) in the last 12 months.

In the context of ethnicity, the data also provide some noteworthy insights. For example, the
percentage of Māori respondents (24%) who received unsolicited nudes or nearly nudes was
higher than other groups such as NZ European/Pakeha (18%) and Pacific teens (18%). In
addition, in the last 12 months, 27% of Māori teens were asked for nude or nearly nude
content of themselves, compared to 24% of Pacific, and 21% of NZ European/Pakeha
respondents. On the other hand, compared with other ethnic groups, a slightly higher
percentage of NZ European/Pakeha teens reported to have sent nude or nearly nude images
or videos of themselves (5%) or have shown from their devices nude content to someone else
(8%).
As described in the methodology section, our survey also gathered data from teens with
disabilities. In this report disability is defined as a long-term condition (lasting 6 months or
more) that causes a difficulty with, or stops a person from, seeing (even when wearing glasses
or contact lenses), hearing (even when using a hearing aid), walking (including lifting or
bending), using their hands (to hold, grasp or use objects), learning (including concentrating
or remembering), and communicating, mixing with others or socialising.
The survey data reveal that the prevalence of some aspects of the sharing of nude content is
higher in teens with disabilities than those without impairments (see Table 4). For instance,
when asked whether they have received nude or nearly nude images of videos they did not
ask for, 25% of participants with disabilities said ‘Yes’ compared to 17% of those teens without
disabilities. A similar pattern was identified in terms of being asked for nude or nearly nude
images or videos of themselves. The percentage of teens with disabilities who in the last 12

months were asked for this specific kind of content (23%) was higher than those without
disabilities (18%). Also, being asked for nude or nearly nude images or videos of someone
else was more common for participants experiencing disabilities (9%) compared to nondisabled teens (4%).

Awareness of others’ experiences of the sharing of nudes in the
past 12 months
This sub-section reports key findings about participants’ awareness of other teens who in the
last 12 months have experienced different aspects of the sharing of nudes. As Figure 6
shows, 29% of respondents (almost 3 in 10) mentioned they were aware of someone they
know receiving nudes or nearly nudes they did not ask for. Similarly, almost a quarter (24%)
were aware of someone being asked for nude or nearly nude images or videos of
themselves. In addition, 22% of respondents said they know someone who has sent nudes or
nearly nudes of themselves. In contrast, the percentages of respondents aware of someone
being asked for nude content of someone else, and someone who has shared nude images
of someone else were lower: 12% and 14%, respectively.

In terms of gender, there are noteworthy differences in the level of awareness between girls
and boys in all sharing of nudes experiences (Table 5). These differences are particularly
significant: female respondents (33%) reported knowing someone being asked for nude or
nearly nude images or videos of themselves, compared to male participants (16%). Compared
with boys (22%), more girls (37%) also responded that they know someone who has been sent
unsolicited nude or nearly nude content. Likewise, the percentage of girls (27%) who
responded that they know someone who has sent nude or nearly nude content of themselves
was also higher than boys (16%).

in the past 12 months by gender.
Base: All respondents excluding refusals.

In terms of age, our survey found that it was more common for older teens to know someone
who has received unsolicited nude or nearly nude content: 32% for 16 year olds and 31% for
17 year olds (see Table 6). Younger teens, aged 14 and 15 years old, reported a lower
percentage (27% each).
As Table 6 shows, a similar pattern was found when older participants were asked about
knowing someone who has sent nude images or videos of themselves, and shared online this
type of content of someone else. Also, more participants aged 16 years old (32%) reported
knowing someone who has been asked for nude or nearly nude images or videos of
themselves. Similarly, 28% of respondents in this age group were aware of someone who has
received a request for nude content, compared to 17 year old participants, who were 3
percentile points below (25%). The figures for 14 and 15 year old teens were 20% and 22%,
respectively.

Level of agreement with statements regarding the sharing of
nudes
The survey included a psychometric scale question to measure participants’ level of
agreement with seven statements related to the sharing of nudes. The respondents were
asked to evaluate each statement by choosing from a five-point rating scale (strongly agree,
agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree). The overall results are
presented in Figure 7.

We decided to run an additional analysis by grouping participants’ net agreement and net
disagreement values. As illustrated in Figure 8, this approach provided some more insight
into New Zealand teens’ evaluation of the seven statements provided.
About half of respondents (53%) disagree/strongly disagree with the statement that sending
nudes is a good way to explore things about themselves as they grow up, compared to 12% of
participants who overall agreed with the statement. The percentage of girls (61%) that did not
agree with the statement was higher than boys (46%). In terms of ethnicity, 57% of NZ
European/Pakeha participants expressed their disagreement with the statement while 49% of
Asian, 46% of Māori, and 37% of Pacific respondents did so.
Similarly, the view against the statement that ‘It is OK to keep nudes that have been sent to
you long after you received them’ was more prevalent. Overall, 63% of participants disagreed
with the statement and just 8% agreed with it. In terms of gender, 70% of girls and 56% of
boys expressed their disagreement with the idea that keeping nude content was acceptable.
When asked to evaluate the statement ‘information and advice for young people tackles
these issues well’, nearly half of the respondents (49%) neither agreed nor disagreed with it,
while a third of them (33%) expressed their agreement. On the other hand, while just over 1 in
5 teens (22%) agreed that adults overreact about the sharing of nudes, 4 in 10 thought the
opposite as 44% of respondents did not agree with the statement.
Over 7 in 10 respondents (72%) agreed that people should be punished for threatening to
share images. Teens that neither agreed nor disagreed represented 19% while those who
disagreed with the statement only accounted for 9% of all responses. In terms of gender,
more girls (75%) agreed that those threatening to share nudes should be punished compared
to boys (68%).
The participants were also asked to evaluate this statement about sharing nude content: ‘It's
not a problem as everyone does it.’ A large majority of respondents (72%) disagreed with it,
compared to 7% who agreed. Just over 2 in 10 (21%) neither agreed nor disagreed. However,
compared to boys (67%), more girls (76%) disagree with the statement that sharing nudes is
an acceptable behaviour.
Compared with prior statements, differences were less significant when the participants were
asked to evaluate whether ‘there's a lot of pressure to send nude or nearly nude
images/videos.’ The results show that 38% of respondents did not concur with the statement,
34% neither agreed nor disagreed, and 29% were in accord with it. However, a closer look at
the data in terms of gender shows that more girls (35%) agree that there is pressure to send
nudes compared to boys (23%).

In their own words: Why some teens send nudes
The survey also collected qualitative data regarding participants’ views about the sharing of
nude content online. We specifically asked them why they think people their age send nude
or nearly nude images or videos of themselves. By including an open-ended question, we
were able to obtain insights based on their own words and perceptions. An inductive analysis
of the data through coding allowed the identification of four main categories:
1.

Attention, social approval, and peer pressure;

2. Moral stance about the behaviour;
3. Sexual exploration/relationships; and
4. Sharing of nudes as an unproblematic behaviour.
The following sub-sections describe these categories in more detail.

26 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

ATTENTION, SOCIAL APPROVAL, AND SOCIAL PRESSURE
About half of responses (54%) fell under this category. However, there were some differences
regarding gender. In particular, these perceptions about why some teens send nude images
of themselves were more common among females (61%) than males (47%).
A shared view between these participants was that sending nude or nearly nude content was
related to young people’s need for attention, acceptance, and popularity. One participant
summarised this point in the following way.

“[T]hey are desperate for the attention and are only doing it to become
more 'popular'.” Female, 14 years, NZ European
Another female respondent concurred with this view, highlighting how easy is to engage in
this sort of practice through digital means.

“Teens image these days. Everyone wants to be popular. Its easily
done at the click of a button.” Female, 15 years, NZ European
Participants also pointed out that self-esteem was a reason for the sharing of nude content
online. Some associated this behaviour with insecurity and low levels of self-confidence
among those who engage in the sharing of nudes.

“Because they have low self-esteem and think that doing this will make
people like them more or want them.” Female, 16 years, NZ European
Others, however, commented that being too self-assured can also explain why some teens
send nudes of themselves.

“Some people are confident about their bodies, and can send them for
sexual gratification for themselves or someone else.” Female, 17 years,
NZ European
Participants also mentioned social pressure as a significant factor that explains the sharing of
nude content online among some teens. Respondents who shared this view highlighted that
pressure from peers exerted a role.

"Mostly, I think it’s all to do with peer pressure If your friends are doing
it then they think you should too. I think that's stupid." Female, 17 years,
Māori
One participant added that coercion can also be a factor.

“Others may be pressured into sending nudes, due to the person
threatening them, or by peer pressure.” Female, 17 years, NZ European
A few participants recalled that pressure for sending “nudies” also takes place within a
romantic relationship.

“Pressured into it by others such as boyfriends wanting nude pic of
their girlfriend”. Male, 15 years, NZ European

27 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

Among those who mentioned social pressure, there was also a group of respondents who
pointed out that the demands for nudes were gendered. Several female respondents agreed
with this point.

“I think for females they are often badgered to send nudes by males
because “it’s not a big deal” but once you’ve sent it. It’s out forever.”
Female,17 years, NZ European

MORAL STANCE ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR
17% of participants hold a moral stance against teens who send nudes of themselves.
Participants in this category used words such as “gross”, “disgusting”, “stupid”, “dumb”, and
“immature’ to express their disapproval of those teens involved in this kind of behaviour. The
findings show that a higher percentage of participants with an Asian background considered
the sharing of nudes morally wrong (27%).
Overall, there was no significant statistical difference in terms of gender. However, the
percentage of younger participants, those aged 14 years old, condemning the behaviour was
slightly higher than older respondents. In the view of a female respondent, the sharing of
nudes is a widespread behaviour and it must stop.

“I think it's disgusting because we're only like 13 - 15 and we're already
exposing our precious body to others, and it happens so much. I hear
about people exposing nudes and others and trying to get back at
them by exposing theirs. It needs to stop but I doubt it will. That's just
how things are these days to be honest.” Female, 14 years, NZ
European
Another participant had a different opinion. While he considered the sharing of nude content
as “disgusting”, he pointed out that this behaviour was not the norm within his personal social
network. He remembered a situation that involved his peers.

“It's disgusting, I can't think why someone would do it. Once on the bus
a boy from our school air dropped a photo of his penis to everyone on
the bus. Everyone deleted except one boy who kept it and then
showed the Dean at school the next day. The boy who air dropped it
got into serious trouble.” Male, 14 years, NZ European
As described above, the qualitative data show that most participants gave different reasons
for blaming those who send nude or nearly nude pictures or videos of themselves. For some
respondents, however, sharing nudes was not the sole responsibility of teens. They also
considered other factors. One participant, for instance, commented that young people’s
attitudes are influenced by popular culture, in particular celebrities.

"[B]ecause famous people have done it first and they want to copy
them!! and some people don't have the guts to stick to their standards
and say no when asked for this stuff." Female, 16 years, Asian

28 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

The role of family was also highlighted by a few participants.

“Because most adults accept this as normal and don't warn their
children about the dangers so teens see it as normal even fun.” Male,
15 years, NZ European
One participant commented that sharing nudes is the result of society’s declining moral
values.

“[S]ocial pressure, a result of dropping standards of behaviour/respect
for others, sexual liberalism resulting in pressure to get into sexual
behaviour before mature enough/ready, lack of human and selfrespect/discipline, no/hardly any punishment for perpetrators, social
acceptance of lewd behaviour in public/online, internet/Telco providers
allowing such content to be exchanged etc etc.” Female, 16 years, NZ

15% of comments fitted into the sexual exploration/relationships category. These views were
more common among teens with an Asian background (22%), followed by those participants
identifying as NZ European/Pakeha (17%). In terms of age, the proportion of older teens, 16 or
17 years old, who commented in this way was higher than younger teens. On the other hand,
there was a minimal percentile difference between males (16%) and females (15%).
The qualitative data show that for most boys and girls the sharing of nudes was a way to
explore and express the changes that teens are going through, physically and emotionally.

“Because in this stage of their lives they want to experience what it’s
like to have sex and see body parts of the opposite gender. Some just
do it so they can meet up.” Female, 17 years, NZ European
Another participant reflected on the matter in the following way.

“We are still growing up and we're unsure about our bodies and
sexuality and our preferences. It's also a good way to gain trust in a
relationship.” Male, 16 years, NZ European
As shown above, some participants considered that sending nudes was another way to
explore, express attraction and flirt.

“We're at an age where we want to explore new things, and that
includes sexual interactions such as flirting or sending nudes. some
people do it for attention, and some do it because they feel like they
have to in order to keep the other person interested.” Female, 16 years,
NZ European
While teens commented that sharing nudes online was, to an extent, part of growing up as a
teenager, they had different opinions about the implications of engaging in this behaviour
through digital means.

“Hormones are crazy when you're a teenager. A lot of teenagers are
trying to figure out their sexuality at this time, which is a normal thing,
and doing so online can be less scary than doing face to face.” Gender
diverse, 17 years, Samoan
In contrast, another participant highlighted the risk of engaging in this practice.

“I think because they are at the point of puberty where they want to
find someone to love and when they are at that point of their
relationship where they do that kind of stuff or they are just being
stupid and not thinking of the consequences.” Male, 15 years, NZ
European
Some comments put the sharing of nudes in the context of teens seeking to develop and
maintain romantic relationships but also as a mechanism to forge trust with their partners.

“To show how much you trust someone or like/love someone for them
to see your nude body. Sometimes people of the same sex who are
neither gay or lesbian just do it as a joke and know the receiver will
take it as a joke.” Male, 17 years, NZ European

“It's usually because they like the boy/girl who asked for the nude pics
and they'll do whatever he/she says just to make him/her like them or
ask them out. That's what happens with girls at my school, don't know if
it's the same elsewhere.” Female, 14 years, Māori

“A lot of the time (in situations I have heard of) it is a one-off type of
thing. That two people trusted each other to do it one time. Otherwise
when people are in relationships it's something special they want to
share with one another.” Female, 15 years, NZ European

SHARING NUDES AS AN UNPROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOUR
The findings also show that a small percentage of participants (6%) did not consider the
sharing of nude content online as a problem. However, the percentage was higher among
teens from one ethnic group: 9% of NZ European/Pakeha teens responded that this
behaviour was not an issue of concern, compared to Māori, Pacific, and Asian participants (3%
each).
Respondents had different reasons to support their views. Some considered that sharing
nudes was a personal choice as well as the individual’s prerogative.

“Because it’s their own right and responsibility and if that’s what they
want to do then that’s their choice.” Male, 17 years, NZ European
This type of responses was more common among male teens, including younger ones.

30 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

“Because we can, we are nearly adult and we are exploring. its
harmless as long as it’s what you want to do.” Male, 14 years, NZ
European
Several participants did not think that sharing nudes was an issue to be worried about
because it has become a “normal” thing to do.

“[Be]cause sending nudes has been normalised by our generation.
people see sending nudes as a normal thing to do so they just accept
it.” Male, 17 years, NZ European
One female participant, for example, reflected on how the apparent normalisation of this
behaviour is affecting her.

“I feel like it’s become a bit of a norm, I've definitely considered it but
I'm just to worried about how they could be shared to people don't
know. I feel like people do things like that online but they wouldn't do it
in real life, because online it 'doesn't really count' as its not real or
physical, its 'just' a photo.” Female, 17 years, NZ European.
Male teens surveyed not only perceived the sharing of nudes online as a normal practice but
also fun and attractive.

“I have received nudes myself and I know that it was just some casual
fun with a friend, I do think that adults take things such as this too
seriously though I can understand why there are issues, i.e. one's
nudes being shared without their permission, or shared on social
media where anyone has access to it." Male, 15 years, NZ European

“People find it attractive/arousing to send and receive these type of
images." Male, 15 years, NZ European

Discussion and Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and extent of sharing nude or
nearly nude images and videos among teens aged 14-17 years old in New Zealand, and
identify relevant characteristics and/or differences in terms of gender, age, disability, and
ethnic group.

Why this study, why now?
Despite public attention, research on this specific topic in New Zealand has been absent. This
is particularly surprising considering that young people are typically regarded as a vulnerable
population group, and the opportunities afforded by digital technologies are accompanied by
challenges and risks. While the international body of knowledge on the prevalence of the
sharing of nude content through digital means is growing, in New Zealand reflection and
discussion about this topic have been based on anecdotal information. This study is the first
in its kind in the country and contributes to closing the gap in knowledge of this important
topic by providing evidence-based insights from a representative sample of New Zealand
teens. In addition to the value the insights from this study have for policy makers and
practitioners it is anticipated it will provide a valuable source of information for researchers
seeking to build the knowledge base around this topic.

What do the findings tell us?
NZ teens sharing nudes of themselves is not as prevalent as the public might believe
Only 4% of participants reported sharing a nude in the last year. This suggests there is a
difference between public perception and the reality of how many young people are actively
engaged in this practice. This finding is interesting because digital tools, particularly
smartphones, and their use are pervasive among young people, making it technically very
straightforward for them to create, copy and share nude content if they so wish. Further, while
many New Zealand teens (3 in 10) agreed that there is a lot pressure to share nudes, it does
not follow that they choose to do so.
Further, this result is similar to international experience. Early representative research
conducted in the United States (Lenhart, 2009) and the UK (Livingstone et al., 2010) revealed
similar rates of this behaviour to ours, albeit with some differences in the age of study
participants. In addition, a study conducted this year by Australia’s Office of the eSafety
Commissioner, using a methodology similar to ours, found 5% of Australian teens have sent
nude content of themselves (Lavoipierre, 2017). Simply, this finding should help to debunk any
idea that “everybody is doing it”.
Understanding teens’ behaviours and experiences requires a deeper look into the different
dimensions of this phenomenon
The findings also highlight other aspects of the sharing of nude content that require
consideration and discussion. Young people are more likely to receive than send nude
content with nearly 1 in 5 teens (18%) reporting to have received unsolicited content in the last
12 months. This pattern is reflected in other international research (Klettke et al., 2014). In
addition, 1 in 5 participants have been asked for nudes of themselves while about 3 in 10

32 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

know someone who has received unsolicited content. Thus, when we expand the definition of
the behaviours involved, the number of young people involved increases. This is supported
by the increasing prevalence of sharing nudes as age increases through adolescence. So,
while sharing nudes of themselves is not normative (i.e., standard behaviour) it is widespread
enough to have entered the culture as a norm (i.e., a commonly accepted behaviour). This
suggests young people find themselves part of a culture around the sharing of nudes,
whether they are active, passive or peripheral participants.
NZ teens’ attitudes to, and motivations for, sharing nude content are more mature than
adults may believe
Other findings from the study support this idea. Answers to questions that explored young
people’s attitudes to sharing nudes indicate that while the different aspects of sharing nudes
are experienced more frequently, they are generally not accepted by New Zealand teens.
Basically, the participants clearly indicate that they do not like this practice. However, they
also understand why these behaviours are happening. For them, it is all part of growing up as
a person, which includes the emotional and physical changes this involves. As they
commented, sharing nudes can be “gross” and “stupid’ but is also part of teens’ need for
social acceptance and attention. In their view, it is a means of identity formation and sexual
exploration, even a way of building trust within a romantic relationship. They are also aware of
the risks and most of them think that a young person is responsible for what they do online.
However, they also consider that other factors, such as peer pressure, explain this behaviour.
Some teens even see the sharing of nudes as an unproblematic issue, arguing that adults
also “sext” and that, it follows, they have the right to do it as well. Clearly, these views of New
Zealand teens unveil a disconnection between what they are experiencing and thinking, and
the current public and media discourse and debate around the topic.
The number of young people sharing nudes differs with age
Recently, public attention has centred on younger teens who are believed to be increasingly
sending nude content of themselves. This study shows that among those who have sent a
picture of themselves in the last 12 months, older teens are more active than the younger
ones. This finding is consistent with previous research that concludes that older age is
predictive of sexting for adolescents (Klettke et al., 2014). However, as this is the first study of
its kind it is not possible to comment on trends in incidence of sharing nudes. Further, as our
study focused on 14-17 year old teens, we do not have direct evidence for those aged under
14 sending nudes of themselves as reported in the media (Corcoran, 2017; Ford, 2017). Thus,
more research on the prevalence of this behaviour among younger children is still required.
Not all young New Zealanders have the same experience, with differences between
genders, ethnicities and those with a long-term disability.
The relationship between the sharing of nude content and gender has attracted research
attention in the last few years (Ringrose et al., 2013; Sevcikova, 2016). This study has found
some relevant gender differences in how young people experience the sharing of nudes in
the New Zealand context. Girls are not only being asked for nude or nearly nude content of
themselves but also receiving more unsolicited nude pictures or videos than boys. While the
overall percentage of teens who have asked for nude content is low, boys are more likely to
request it than girls. In essence, New Zealand girls are more likely than boys to be the target

33 | Teens and “sexting” in New Zealand: Prevalence and Attitudes

of requests for their nudes, or receiving them from other people without request. This finding
mirrors international research (Ringrose et al., 2013; Salter, Crofts, & Lee, 2012) and confirms
that gender is an important element in explaining this behaviour. Perhaps unsurprisingly, girls
agree more often than boys that there is pressure to send nudes.
The sharing of nudes is a complex phenomenon. As highlighted above, age and gender are
important aspects that help to understand the sharing of this type of content among teens.
However, this study also revealed some significant characteristics in experiences based on
participants’ ethnicity; and those with a disability. Both groups are more likely to be asked for
nude content of themselves, and receive unsolicited nude content compared to other ethnic
groups and those teens without disabilities.
This study contributes to the understanding of NZ teens’ sharing of nudes, but more
research is required
While the findings are representative of the targeted population, they provide a snapshot of
the topic. Further in-depth exploration of the way New Zealand teens navigate risks and deal
with potential harm caused by this behaviour is needed. Similarly, research to date mostly
centres on teens’ individual behaviour, while little is known about the role of contextual
factors (socio-cultural, technical and legal) on the sharing of nude content. For example, what
is the role of the algorithms that operate online platforms in the distribution of nude content?
In addition, as this is a niche area of research in New Zealand, further research is required to
explore the relationship between sharing nude content, whether consensual or not, and other
digital challenges such as online bullying, harassment, and sexual violence and abuse.
