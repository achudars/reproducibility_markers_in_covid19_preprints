Assessing the organizational climate for
translational research with a new survey tool
Abstract
Promoting biomedical translation from bench to bedside and back in organizational settings is a central challenge for
research managers and policymakers. For this, organizational leaders need to assess baseline conditions, identify
areas needing improvement, and to judge the impact of specific initiatives to sustain or improve translational
research practices at their institutions. Currently, there is a lack of such an assessment tool addressing the specific
context of translational biomedical research. To close this gap, we have developed and tested a new survey for
assessing the organizational climate for translational research. This self-assessment tool measures employees’
perceptions of translational climate and underlying research practices in organizational environments and builds on
the established Survey of Organizational Research Climate. Having implemented the new survey in practice, we show
that scientists at a large university hospital (Charité Berlin) perceive translation as a central and important
component of their work. Importantly, local resources and direct support are main contributing factors for the
practical implementation of translation into their own research practice. We identify and discuss potential leverage
points for an improvement of research climate to foster successful translational research.

Introduction
Promoting biomedical translation from bench to bedside and back in organizational settings is a central challenge for
research managers and policymakers. Several attempts have been made to model translational research as a linear,
bidirectional, or circular process [1-5], and it has been suggested that framing translation one way or another will
have practical implications, e.g. on ‘how we train the next generation of researchers’ [6]. It has also become clear
that supporting translational research is more than a matter of disseminating evidence about best practices to
researchers and practitioners and expecting instant improvement. Instead, organizational leaders tasked with
2

improving translational research at their institutions understand that translational practices are diverse, highly
context specific, and dependent on organizational cultures in support of translation [6-10].
So far, no tool exists that would allow organizational leaders to assess baseline conditions, identify areas needing
improvement, and to judge the impact of specific initiatives to sustain or improve translational research practices at
their institutions. To close this gap, we have developed and tested a survey for assessing the organizational climate
for translational research. This Survey of Translational Research Climate (STRC) can be used as a self-assessment tool
to assess employees’ perceptions of translational climate and potentially underlying research practices and
conditions in organizational environments. Aggregated responses within meaningful organizational units provides a
measure of group-level perceptions of environmental conditions, i.e. the ‘organizational climate’, for translational
research.
Organizational researchers define organizational climate as ‘the shared meaning organizational members attach to
the events, policies, practices, and procedures they experience and the behaviors they see being rewarded,
supported, and expected’ [11]. Organizational climate is conceptually distinct from organizational culture, the latter
of which is a ‘deeper-level construct’ [11]. Organizational culture puts the focus on organizational members’
perceptions of their organizational environment, while organizational climate puts the focus on judgements and
values [12]. However, the two concepts are intimately connected: organizational climate ‘is both the manifestation
of culture...and the data on which culture comes to be inferred and understood’ [13].
In developing the STRC, we built on the Survey of Organizational Research Climate (SORC) that assesses the
organizational climate with respect to research integrity. The STRC follows the general structure of the SORC, a
validated questionnaire, but rephrases the questions in terms of translational climate.
As in the original SORC, the STRC distinguishes between two levels of analysis: 1) the immediate research
environment (individuals’ primary subunit, such as research group or institute), and 2) the organization as a whole.
Consequently, we define translational research climate as the product of individual and group perceptions about
their organizational unit – whether institution, division, department, center, program, or work group – in terms of
how it values, is committed to, and administers its programs in ways that encourage the translation of results
between basic research, clinical research, and practice.

This paper reports a first assessment of this newly developed instrument that was implemented at one of Europe's
largest university hospitals, the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and compared against results from the original
SORC.

Methods
Measures
The full questionnaire can be found in supplemental File 1. Here we describe its component parts.

Translational research climate
To assess the climate for translational research, we have developed a standardized questionnaire, modeled after the
SORC, whose items fall into two groups: a) six items assessing the organizational climate for translational research
practices on the institutional level (section 2A of the survey), b) twelve items assessing the organizational climate for
translational research practices on the level of one’s immediate research environment (section 2B of the survey).
Each item asks about the respondent’s perception of a particular aspect of the translational research climate in the
organization as a whole or in the respondent’s immediate research environment, respectively, e.g. ‘How committed
are the senior administrators at your institution (e.g. deans, executive board) to supporting translational research?’.
Respondents rated items on a 5 point scale: 1) Not at All, 2) Somewhat, 3) Moderately, 4) Very, and 5) Completely.
To avoid forcing respondents to rate items, we offered two more response options: 6) No Basis for Judging, and 7)
Prefer not to Disclose.
The selection and formulation of items underwent a two-step process. First, we checked for all original SORC items if
they can be adapted for our purpose by replacing key formulations, e.g. ‘responsible research’ by ‘translational
research’. Some SORC items had to be dropped, since they would not make sense when applied to translational
research climate, e.g. items about research misconduct. Second, we discussed our list of items among our project
group, which included both medical researchers, experts on translational medicine, and social scientists. We then
assessed the construct validity with five respondents during a pretest phase. Respondents were of different status
(graduate students, post docs, professors), gender, and working at different ends of the bench to bedside continuum
(researchers, clinicians, clinician scientists).
4

Translational research practices
We further included a set of 15 items asking about the respondents’ self-reported translational research practices
(section 2C of the survey) to be able to relate these to the perceived translational research climate. We constructed
these items to reflect six dimensions of translational practices – 1) education, 2) communication, 3) publication, 4)
collaboration, 5) career path, 6) overall. We identified these dimensions using qualitative data (literature review and
interviews with 78 researchers, clinicians, and clinician scientists) from a previous research project on translation [910]. The items were discussed and tested, together with the translational climate items, in our project group and in
our pretest.

Research integrity climate
We also included the complete set of research integrity climate items of the original SORC – 11 items for assessing
institutional climate (section 1A of the survey) and 21 items for assessing the climate of the immediate research
environment (section 1B of the survey). This allowed us to investigate whether constructs in our translational
research climate survey (STRC) were distinct from established constructs of research integrity climate (SORC).

Other measures
Section 3 of the survey included questions about the professional status at the institution, primary departmental
affiliation, enrollment in a doctoral program, number of years working in research, whether one’s research is
preclinical, clinical, or both, professional areas of interest, size of the immediate research environment, gender, and
year of birth.
For sections 1 and 2 in our survey, we also included a final free text question to allow the respondent to make
further comments, e.g. ‘Are there any other things about your experience with translational research practices at
your institution that you would like to tell and about which we have not already asked?’

Data collection
Our study was approved by the Charité’s ethics committee (ethics vote number EA1/184/17) as well as the Data
Protection Office and the staff council and was conducted as an anonymous web-based survey. For the use of the
SORC, a license agreement was signed. The Charité administration helped us to identify all researchers and doctoral
students working at the institution, 7264 individuals in total. We generated an equal number of electronical tokens
5

and provided these to the study center’s administration, the latter of which created a linking table, assigning tokens
to email addresses, and sent the researchers invitation emails with a token-unique-hyperlink to the online survey,
followed by a reminder two weeks later. The emails were sent in the name of the Dean of the Charité. As an
incentive to participate, per participant 2€ were donated to one of two preselected non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) working in the field of health care, from which participants could choose after having finished the
questionnaire. This study was preregistered on OSF (https://osf.io/qak8e/). The survey was online for a period of
four weeks during February and March 2018. Of all 7264 invitees, 1095 opened the survey for at least one second,
969 answered at least the first question, 602 completed at least section 1 (the SORC), 533 completed at least section
2B (the STRC), 523 completed at least section 2C (self-reported translational research practices). 521 invitees
completed the whole questionnaire including all status and demographic items, resulting in a response rate of 7%.
A non-response analysis conducted after completion of the survey and sent to all invitees returned that a number of
participants were interrupted during filling the survey but were not aware that they could continue later on or
simply forgot to do so. Others were discouraged by the length of the questionnaire.
To guarantee the anonymity of the respondents, none of the authors had access to the study center’s linking table,
assigning tokens to email addresses, and the study center, in turn, had no access to the raw data, linking tokens to
individual responses. Three of the authors (AS, BH, MR) deleted the token column and further pseudonymized
responses by aggregating birth years into 5-year intervals and omitting the answers of the free text questions. The
resulting dataset and the corresponding codebook are available from the OSF database at
https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/QAK8E.

Statistical analysis
When analyzing our data, we investigated two types of relationships, R1 and R2, as illustrated in Fig 1. First, we
established relevant factors for the STRC. Subsequently, we examined the identified factors for uniqueness with
regard to the SORC questionnaire (R1). Finally, we investigated the relationship between the STRC and the items on
translational research practice (R2).

Fig 1. Relations between STRC and SORC. In the analysis of the STRC we focus on examining the overlap of
STRC questions and the SORC questions (R1) as well as the relationship between STRC and translational
practice questions (R2).

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis
To determine factors that summarize the answers to the STRC on a reduced number of scales we performed an
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the STRC part of the questionnaire. For this, we followed the methods used for
the development of the SORC scales [14].
In summary, we mapped the answers to a numerical scale ranging from 1 (‘Not at all’) to 5 (‘Completely’). We then
determined the number of factors by Horn’s parallel analysis [15]. The factor analysis was conducted using maximum
likelihood estimation under a varimax rotation, which forces the individual items to load primarily on one of the
factors. Each item was assigned to the factor for which it had the highest loading. No further modification was done
for the factors after the analysis. For this analysis, participants were excluded who did not complete the
questionnaire or gave answers ‘No basis for judging’ or ‘Prefer not to disclose’ more than 50% of the time for the
STRC part of the questionnaire, leaving the answers of 438 participants for the analysis (i.e. 83 participants with
>50% ‘No basis for judging’ or ‘Prefer not to disclose’ answers for the STRC part).
As we had only one third of the participant responses available as were used for the original SORC validation (438 full
responses compared to 1267 responses for SORC), we chose a slightly different approach for the confirmatory factor
analysis. Instead of initially splitting the full dataset into two parts, we used the full dataset for the EFA for the initial
estimate of the factors. Then the dataset was split into two random parts n=100 times. Each time the EFA was
repeated on one half of the data to assess the robustness of the factors under different partitioning of the data. A
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was then performed on the second half of the data, fixing the factors as
determined in the EFA on the first half of the data. The average goodness of fit parameters (χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA,
SRMR) were calculated for the CFA models to assess the adequacy of the fit.
7

Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the STRC and the SORC by performing an analogous exploratory
factor analysis (EFA) on the combined question set of both questionnaires to test if the factor analysis distinguishes
the STRC and SORC parts of the questionnaire.

Regression modeling
Next, we analyzed the relationship between the STRC and the translational research practice questions using a
regression analysis.
The following six dimensions of self-reported translational research practices were constructed prior to the
conduction of the survey: overall (questions 2C01, 2C02), education (2C03), communication (2C04, 2C09, 2C10),
publication (2C05, 2C06, 2C07, 2C08), collaboration (2C11, 2C12), career path (2C13, 2C14).
For the STRC questions, we used the factors that we established in the factor analysis. For both the STRC factors and
the practice dimensions, we calculated the average scores for each factor/dimension as the mean of the scores for
each question belonging to the factor/dimension. The average score was only calculated if participants answered
more than 50% of the questions belonging to the factor/dimension.
To assess the relationship between the STRC factor scores and the practice dimension scores, we fitted a multiple
linear regression model for each of the practice dimension using the three STRC factor scores as predictive variables.
As the ‘career path’ dimension consists of two ‘yes/no’ questions, we fit a logistic regression model in this case. For
this we categorized the answers for this practice dimension as follows: a) at least one of the two questions answered
‘yes’ b) none of the questions answered ‘yes’. To account for the many different models that are tested, resulting pvalues were corrected using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure [16].
The intraclass correlation (ICC) with respect to the institutions centers is calculated for the STRC factors to test if
there is a difference in the perception of translational research practices within the surveyed institution.
For easier comparison with the results obtained in a study on the relationship between research integrity climate
and practice for the SORC survey [17], we additionally repeated their analysis methods on the STRC (supplemental
Table S3).

Results
STRC Factors
To determine into which coherent categories the items of the STRC can be grouped, we performed a factor analysis.
The parallel analysis estimated that four factors are needed for the factor analysis. However, the EFA using four
factors yielded one factor mainly determined by one question (2B08: ‘How effectively are junior researchers
socialized in translational research practices?’). Thus, we decided to use three factors for the EFA instead.
As can be seen in Table 1, whereas factor 1 (‘Immediate environment’) only loads questions concerning the
immediate research environment, factor 2 (’Institution’) only loads questions on the institutional level. Factor 3
(’Lack of resources & pressure’) combines four questions that deal with the lack of resources and publishing
pressure. For all questions of factor 3, a larger score is inversely coded compared to the other questions, i.e. higher
values denote a more negative view of the research environment.

Questions for each factor are sorted according to factor loadings.

Repeating the EFA on random 50% subsets of responses yielded a stable estimate of factors. While the factors
stayed the same as for the EFA on the full data in 83 of the 100 cases, only one question is shifted between factors in
the remaining 17 cases. The CFA applied on the other halves of the responses yielded average goodness of fit
parameters that are slightly worse than those obtained for the original SORC (χ2 = 283, df = 132, CFI = 0.85, RMSEA =
0.10, SRMR = 0.091).
The average scores for the factors denote mean scores of all items belonging to a factor. The mean is not weighted
by the EFA factor loadings, analogously to the SORC questionnaire. The average scores for the STRC factors for our
survey responses are reported in Table 2. High values of Cronbach’s α, especially for the first two factors,
demonstrate a good internal consistency of the factors.

When combining the STRC and SORC, Horn’s parallel analysis estimated that 7 factors are necessary for the factor
analysis. The EFA yielded seven factors that separate the two questionnaires well: while there are only SORC
questions in factors 1, 3 (except for one STRC question), and 7, there are only STRC questions in factors 2 and 5 (see
supplemental Table S1). The STRC factors found in the combined factor analysis directly relate to the factors
established for the STRC questionnaire alone: factor 2 in the combined analysis loads the same items as factor 1 in
the STRC factor analysis and factor 5 (combined) loads the same items as factor 2 (STRC) except for one item (2A04).
Additionally, there are two mixed factors that combine the STRC and SORC questions on the same topic: factor 4
(pressure to publish & obtain funding) and 6 (insufficient resources).

Relationship STRC and translational research practices (R2)
To investigate how the STRC factors relate to the different dimensions of translational practice, we performed a
multiple linear regression analysis per practice dimension with the STRC factors as predictors.
As shown in Fig 2, the connection is strongest and most consistent for the ‘Immediate environment’ factor, while the
coefficient estimates were smaller for the ‘institution’ factor and the ‘Lack of resources & pressure’. The largest
effect sizes (i.e. regression coefficients) were found between the variables ‘Immediate environment’ and ‘Overall’ (β
= 0.54, p = 9.5 x 10-15), ‘Immediate environment’ and ‘Collaboration’ (β = 0.30, p = 8.6 x 10-5), ‘Immediate
environment’ and ‘Communication’ (β = 0.24, p = 5.1 x 10-5) (supplemental Table S2).

Fig 2: Regression coefficients for the STRC factors and their confidence intervals for all six regression
models for the different practice dimensions. For the ‘Career path’ dimension a logistic regression was used,
such that this regression coefficient is not directly comparable with the other coefficients.

13

The negative relation between the institutional climate and the overall practice is driven by respondents that give
high scores for both the translational climate in the immediate environment and the overall practice but low scores
for the translational climate in the institution.
The explained variance was calculated for each of the multiple linear regression models and ranges from R2 = 0.18 for
the ‘Overall’ practice dimension to R2 = 0.02 for the ‘Publication’ dimension (supplemental Table S2).
A comparison with the SORC validation results (using the same methods, see supplemental Table S3) [17] gives a
similar magnitude of regression coefficients with less of the coefficients being significant – possibly due to the
smaller participant number in our study.
The intraclass correlation of the STRC factor scores with respect to the institution’s centers shows no substantial
variation of score distributions within the different parts of the institution: the ICC is consistent with zero for two
STRC factors (‘Immediate environment’: ICC = -0.0086, 95% CI [-0.023, 0.032], ‘Lack of resources & pressure’: ICC = -

14

0.0059, 95% CI [-0.024, 0.043]) and negligibly small for the third factor (‘Institution’: ICC = 0.039, 95% CI [0.0009,
0.137]). Thus the institution’s centers were not included in the regression model.

Discussion
We presented a new survey for assessing the organizational climate for translational research (STRC), which can be
used as a self-assessment tool to assess employees’ perceptions of translational research practices and conditions in
organizational environments. The Survey of Translational Research Climate (STRC) was modelled after the Survey of
Organizational Research Climate (SORC), the latter of which assesses research integrity climate.
We assessed the STRC in a study with 521 respondents from the Charité, which also included the complete original
SORC. Firstly, STRC items discriminated into three factors: 1) items concerning translational climate in the immediate
research environment, 2) items concerning translational climate at the institutional level, and 3) items concerning
publishing pressure and the lack of resources. STRC factors 1 and 2 showed good internal validity.
Second, we found that the STRC was clearly distinct from the SORC with an overlap only in two factors. While the
two main factors of the STRC remained basically unchanged, two issues – ‘pressure to publish & obtain funding’ as
well as ‘insufficient resources’ – turned out to be cross-cutting factors when it came to respondents’ assessment of
translational as well as research integrity climate. This suggests that these two issues are affecting not only the
research integrity climate but also the translational research climate.
Third, we tested the relationship between the three STRC factors and six dimensions derived from additional items
assessing the respondents’ translational practices. That is, we investigated how perceived climate actually translates
into practice. Translational practice across dimensions was mainly determined by the translational climate in the
immediate environment. Neither the institutional climate regarding translation nor the lack of resources had strong
influences on translational practices.
Several limitations apply. Even though the STRC is distinct from the SORC on most factors, our sample at one
institution does not allow a generalization of the identified factors. Tests at additional institutions are necessary to
confirm the exploratory results from our study. We ensured robustness of our results within our sample through

15

cross-validation of our confirmatory factor analysis. In replications in other institutions this robustness test will
reveal whether mapping between factors and questions will be equally stable as in our sample.
Our design tried to maximize response rate by sending reminders, nonetheless, we achieved a suboptimal return
rate. An analysis of the demographics of the sample revealed a mixed picture on how representative our sample was
for the institution given that we matched the gender ratio, but younger researchers like PhD students were overrepresented in our sample. This may overestimate the effect that we find of the immediate research climate on
translational practice. Young researchers are less exposed to institutional structures like research committees and
faculty structures, which manifests as a higher rate of ‘No basis for judging’ answers to the questions on the
institutional climate for the youngest age group (supplemental Table S5). One issue that potentially caused the high
abortion rate is the limited time researchers have to answer such questionnaires. In future installations, SORC
questions should only be included as an additional voluntary set of questions to maximize return for the STRC.
Given our limitations, one result from our study is the positive relationship between immediate research
environment and translational practice. That is, for translation to succeed we identified the immediate research
environment as an important factor. Interventions that aim at improving the translational climate in the immediate
research environment are thus expected to have a positive effect on actual translational practices. Potential
interventions based on the literature are investments in research infrastructure and education, incentives for
interdisciplinary collaboration and better research quality, standards and guidelines, and more institutional support
for bridging agents, such as clinician scientists [19-22].

S2 Table. Regression coefficients for the comparison of the three STRC factors and the predefined six practice
dimensions. One regression model is calculated per practice dimension with the three STRC factors as predictor. For
each regression model the explained variance, F-statistic and corresponding degrees of freedom are given. For each
regression coefficient the corresponding t-statistic and p-value are given. There are several significant coefficients
(given p-values were corrected using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure), most of them involving the “Immediate
environment” factor or the “Overall” practice dimension.
§

As the ‘Career path’ dimension is comprised of ‘yes/no’ questions, a logistic regression model is used in this case.

For this model the McFadden pseudo R2 and the χ2 statistic for the difference between null and residual deviance is
used instead.

S3 Table. Regression coefficients of the comparison of the three STRC factors and the binary-coded six practice
dimensions. There are three significant coefficients (***p < 0.001 after Holm-Bonferroni correction), all involving the
“Immediate environment” factor. Background: To allow for comparison with the results from a study on the
relationship between research integrity climate and practice for the SORC survey [17], we repeated their validation
analysis for the STRC dataset. For this we transformed the STRC practice dimension scores to a binary scale
(analogously to their ‘always’/’not always’ categorization, we categorizing answers into high/low translational
practice, where all scores fall into the high category that are above the median score for this practice dimension). To
assess the relationship between the STRC factor scores and the practice dimension scores we fitted a general linear
model (GLM) with binomial error and logit for each combination of practice dimension as predictive variable and the
binary version of the STRC factor score. To account for the many different models that are tested, resulting p-values
23

were corrected using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure [16]. The magnitude of regression coefficients is similar to
those for the SORC validation for the “Immediate Environment” factor and smaller for the other two factors. There
were much less significant coefficients detected. This might be due to the smaller participant number in our study
(521 participant responses used in the regression models compared to 1267 participants for the SORC validation).
The binary coding of the practice scores was mainly used to compare the logistic regression coefficients to those
presented for the SORC validation. When using the practice scores on their original 1-5 scale (see main text), we
obtained the same three strongly significant regression coefficients plus several additional significant coefficients
(note that the magnitude of the coefficients is interpreted differently in linear and logistic regression models).

Part 2 Organizational climate for translational research practice
The second part of this survey is not about responsible research practices but about translational research practices.
Not everyone agrees on what the term ‘translational’ means. When in doubt, please think of practices that help to
‘translate’ findings in biomedical research into medical practice and meaningful health outcomes (this means, apply
findings from biomedical research to medical practice, c.f. ‘from bench to bedside’). Please answer each of the
following items with respect to the Charité as a whole (Part 2A), your immediate research environment (Part 2B), and
your translational practices (Part 2C).
