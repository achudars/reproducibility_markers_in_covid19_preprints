Abstract:
This study investigates whether increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare for underthree-year-olds in Germany is associated with shorter employment interruptions amongst mothers. By
focusing on a major childcare reform in East and West Germany, we examine the effect in two
contexts that differ markedly in the acceptance and use of formal childcare and maternal employment.
We combine rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2006 to 2014) with
annual administrative county-level data on the availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare,
estimating event history models. The results indicate that increased childcare availability for underthree-year-olds reduces mothers’ employment interruptions, particularly after a second childbirth, and
increases the probability of returning to part-time or full-time employment as opposed to marginal
employment. Furthermore, increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare increases
mothers’ likelihood of returning to employment in the second year after childbirth, when paid leave
entitlements expire and the availability of childcare becomes important. However, our results are only
statistically significant for West German mothers and only after the birth of a second child. The study
extends the literature on women’s return-to-work behaviour by providing evidence on the mediumterm impact of family policy on the duration of mothers’ employment interruptions.

The expansion of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare availability
and mothers’ return-to-work behaviour in East and West
Germany
INTRODUCTION
Germany has a long history as a conservative welfare state with low maternal labour force
participation (e.g., Hanel and Riphahn, 2012), long employment interruptions after childbirth
(e.g., Ziefle and Gangl, 2014) and a substantial motherhood penalty (e.g., Gangl and Ziefle,
2009). Long job-protected parental leave periods with low compensation and low childcare
availability have encouraged the traditional male-breadwinner model, particularly in West
Germany. Even 26 years after reunification, Germany remains a divided country, with East
German mothers returning to employment faster after childbirth and more often to full-time
employment than West German mothers (e.g., Grunow and Müller, 2012; Hanel and Riphahn,
2012). These persistent East-West differences have been frequently explained with greater
availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare for under-three-year-olds in East Germany
(e.g., Grunow and Müller, 2012; Kreyenfeld and Geisler, 2006).
Since 2005, the German government has made immense public investments to increase
childcare services for under-three-year-olds to encourage faster returns to full-time
employment among East and West German mothers. However, to the best of our knowledge,
no study to date has addressed the question whether increased availability of low-cost, statesubsidised childcare actually reduces mothers’ employment interruptions after childbirth.
Studying mothers’ interruption durations and therein resulting return-to-work behaviour is
important to understand persistent gender inequalities. Long family-related employment
interruptions do not only result in a traditional division of labour and an immediate loss of
income for women, but also tend to place mothers on lower career and income trajectories

2

over their life-course, resulting in higher job insecurity and lower pension entitlements (e.g.,
Sigle-Rushton and Waldfogel, 2007).
We contribute to the literature on the effects of childcare availability, by focusing on a
major public childcare reform in Germany and investigate whether increased availability of
low-cost, state-subsidised childcare shortens mothers’ employment interruptions after
childbirth. We link rich individual and household panel information from the German SocioEconomic Panel (2006-2014) with annual administrative records on childcare availability on
the county-level (Kreisebene) to exploit large temporal and regional variation in childcare
availability across counties within and between East and West Germany. By estimating
separate event history models for East and West Germany, we study how the childcare effect
varies in two contexts that differ markedly in their initial levels of childcare availability and
the acceptance of non-parental care and maternal employment.

INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT AND CHILDCARE EXPANSION
Up to the mid-2000s, Germany provided long parental leave periods with low
compensation and limited state-subsidised childcare availability for under-three-year-olds,
particularly in West Germany.1 Together with joint taxation, family health insurance, and
generous child benefits (Bach et al., 2011), this family policy setting encouraged especially
West German mothers to take long career breaks of more than three years and to return most
commonly to part-time employment (Frodermann, Müller and Abraham, 2013). Although
recent parental leave reforms have particularly encouraged shorter employment interruptions
among West German mothers (e.g., Bergemann and Riphahn, 2015; Ziefle and Gangl, 2014),
East German mothers still return to work sooner, and more often in full-time employment.
This strong labour market attachment is often described as the legacy of the former German
Democratic Republic, where paid maternal leave periods were comparatively short and
childcare was widely available (Rosenfeld, Trappe and Gornick, 2004). After the German
3

reunification, childcare availability was reduced in East Germany; however, East-West
disparities in childcare availability persisted. Hence, in early 2006, before the start of the
childcare expansion, more than 30 per cent of all under-three-year-old children in East
Germany attended low-cost, state-subsidised childcare, whereas in West Germany, counties
seldom reached rates above 20 per cent (Federal Statistical Office, 2008).
In the mid-2000s, the government started to implement a major childcare expansion aiming
to speed up mothers’ returns to employment, particularly in West Germany. Although
nationally funded, the reform is planned and implemented by the German federal states and
county-level authorities. In 2005 and 2008, two federal laws were passed to increase countylevel availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare for under-three-year-olds to at least
35 per cent by 2013, including the legal right to childcare for all children aged one and older
that went into effect in August 2013.2 In 2014, 52 per cent of under-three-year-olds in East
Germany attended a childcare institution, compared to 27 percent in West Germany, where a
childcare availability of more than 20 per cent became accessible only after 2009. However,
these averages mask great regional variation in the childcare ratio, ranging from 45 to 63 per
cent in East Germany and from 14 to 47 per cent in West Germany (Strunz, 2015).3
Along with formal childcare, previous research shows that return to work behaviour is also
closely linked to parental leave benefits. Since 2007, parents receive an income-related paid
parental leave for a period of twelve months, which parents can divide between them and
extend it to a total of 14 months if one partner takes at least two months. Parental leave is paid
at 65-67 per cent of net earnings before childbirth (capped at 1,800 Euros) and parents are
provided with a three-year job guarantee.
This description of the institutional context highlights how the interaction of various family
policies and a lack of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare have long encouraged the malebreadwinner model, particularly in West Germany, whereas greater availability of low-cost,
state-subsidised childcare prior to the reform seems to have effectively supported maternal
4

employment among East German mothers. With the recent increase in childcare availability in
West Germany and additional capacities implemented in East Germany, the questions remains
whether this has led to shorter interruption durations.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
So far, research has focused almost exclusively on the effect of formal childcare on maternal
labour supply, as opposed to the interruption duration after childbirth, providing mixed
results. International studies, exploiting exogenous quasi-experimental reform variation in
childcare availability, can be summarised as follows: While some studies show positive
employment effects (see Morrissey, 2017 for an overview), with some studies finding larger
effects in countries where the childcare availability was low prior to an expansion (e.g, Brilli,
Del Boca and Pronzato, 2016 on Italy), others find small or no significant effects (e.g.,
Havnes and Mogstad, 2011 on Norway; Lundin, Mörk and Öckert, 2008 on Sweden). These
small or insignificant estimates are explained with heterogeneous reform effects or with
substitution effects of households using low-cost, state-subsidised childcare instead of
informal care or costly private formal care (e.g., Havnes and Mogstad, 2011).
To our knowledge, no study to date has addressed the question of whether the availability
of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare is associated with shorter employment interruptions
after childbirth. Germany, with its recent childcare expansion, provides an interesting case
study to analyse this effect. International findings on the effects of other childcare expansions
are not applicable, as Germany, in particular West Germany, had an unusually low level of
both private and state-subsidised childcare prior to the reform. Also with regard to welfare or
family policy regime typologies, Germany has become a unique exception, as it combines
family policies which reinforce the traditional male-breadwinner model, such as joint taxation
and family health insurance, with recent policies which support the dual-earner, dual-carer
model, in particular, the parental leave and childcare policies (Schober, 2014). In sum, due to
5

the division of Germany, East and West Germany provide the opportunity to investigate the
effect of increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare in two contexts that
differ remarkably in their pre-reform levels of childcare availability, maternal employment as
well as cultural attitudes towards work and care for young children. The persistent East-West
differences in maternal employment and employment interruption durations have been
frequently explained by greater childcare availability in the East (e.g., Grunow and Müller,
2012). However, no study to date has applied administrative childcare data to systematically
analyse whether the gap in childcare availability between East and West Germany is
responsible for the East-West difference in maternal employment and employment
interruption durations. Pre-reform studies show no statistically significant association between
childcare availability and maternal employment (Büchel and Spieß, 2002; Kreyenfeld and
Hank, 2000). These cross-sectional studies, however, focus exclusively on the unusually low
level of childcare in West Germany and were unable to consider substantial changes in
childcare availability over time, which may explain the non-significant effects.
To date, the few post-reform studies provide mixed evidence on the effects of the recent
childcare expansion in Germany. However, they again concentrate on maternal labour supply
instead of on employment interruption durations after childbirth, without focusing on EastWest differences. Micro-simulations predict the childcare expansion (Haan and Wrohlich,
2011; Bonin et al., 2013) and the legal entitlement to a childcare slot for all children aged one
year or older (Müller and Wrohlich, 2016) to increase maternal employment. Applying a
quasi-experimental design, Geyer, Haan and Wrohlich (2015) show a positive effect on
maternal labour supply, particularly among mothers with children aged two to three years,
confirming the micro-simulations. In contrast, while distinguishing between East and West
Germany, but using only a cross-sectional research design, Schober and Spiess (2015) do not
find a statistically significant effect of childcare availability on maternal labour supply once
they control for childcare quality.
6

Our study adds to the current field of research by investigating the effect of an increased
availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare on the length of East and West German
mothers’ employment interruption durations. We exploit the annual and regional variation in
county-level administrative childcare and survey data, measuring actual employment
behaviour instead of relying on simulation models. Additionally, we investigate whether the
effect differs after the birth of a first or a second child and whether the effect is more
pronounced when the paid parental leave benefits expire and the opportunity costs of
employment increase in the second year after childbirth, as suggested by previous studies
(Haan and Wrohlich, 2011; Geyer, Haan and Wrohlich, 2015). Furthermore, we assess
whether increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare alters the likelihood of
returning to more substantial (full-time or part-time) employment compared to marginal
employment (so-called ‘mini-jobs’), which is defined by a maximum monthly income of 400
Euro (after 2013, 450 Euros) and no social insurance contributions for employees.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Based on both economic and sociological theories, we assume that increased availability of
low-cost, state-subsidised childcare shortens mothers’ employment interruptions and
facilitates faster returns to more substantial employment.
Overall, economic theory predicts shorter employment interruptions whenever low-cost,
state-subsidised childcare availability for very young children is comparatively high (e.g.,
Kreyenfeld and Hank, 2000; Morrissey, 2017). According to the neoclassical theory of labour
supply, mothers rationally decide when to return to work after giving birth in order to
maximise lifetime income as well as household utility by considering their time requirements
at home, market wages as well as alternative income sources such as household income (Blau,
Ferber and Winkler, 2006). Low-cost, state-subsidised childcare reduces the opportunity costs
for a return to work and allows mothers living in counties with greater availability to rely
7

more on childcare than in counties with lower availability (for a more in-depth discussion, see
Leibowitz, Klerman and Waite, 1992). In this theory, mothers who are indifferent about
taking care of a child at home instead of enrolling the child in childcare will return to
employment faster in a county with increased childcare availability than mothers who live in
counties with lower availability. Beyond this, mothers might also decide based on the
expectation that employers consider the duration of the interruption a signal of their
productivity and work commitment (Spence, 1973). With widely available low-cost, statesubsidised childcare more mothers have the possibility to return to work faster and to thereby
signal higher work commitment to employers.
Similarly, sociological theory suggests that formal childcare has the potential to reduce
inter-role conflicts for working mothers (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). Particularly for workoriented mothers with young children, the combination of the role as a caregiver and worker
is likely to result in interfering role demands. By allowing mothers to transfer some of their
care responsibilities to a childcare institution, childcare potentially decreases the inter-role
conflict and this might reduce mothers’ employment interruptions.
Furthermore, constructivist identity approaches (Stets and Burke, 2000) describe the
cultural construction of the ideal mother and worker associated with the individual
opportunity structures and family policies (e.g., Banaszak, 2006; Sjöberg, 2004). Family
policy reforms, such as shorter parental leave periods (Gangl and Ziefle, 2015) and increased
availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare (Zoch and Schober, 2017) have been found
to increase the cultural acceptance of maternal employment. Hence, mothers, who would have
wanted to return to employment but felt constraint by traditional gender role ideologies, might
be more likely to shorten their employment interruption, particularly in a comparatively
traditional context, such as West Germany.
To summarise, both economic and sociological theories assume that the expansion of statesubsidised childcare for under-three-year-olds leads to shorter employment interruptions after
8

childbirth. Based on these theories, we expect mothers to return to employment earlier in
counties with more childcare available for under-three-year-olds (H1).
The economic labour supply theory also allows us to make a clear prediction of when the
effect of childcare on mothers’ return-to-work decisions is strongest. When paid parental
leave entitlements expire in the second year of the child’s life, the utility of staying at home
declines and a negative income effect can be expected. Thereupon mothers heavily rely on
childcare in order to return to work, which makes childcare availability particularly important.
We therefore expect that increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare does not
affect the probability of returning equally but is strongest in the second year after childbirth
(H2).
Increasing childcare availability also allows mothers to work longer hours, as it becomes
more accessible for mother to take-up childcare during specific hours, compared to informal
caring arrangements, which are only available to few and for a few hours a day. We therefore
expect mothers in counties with increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare
to be more likely to work longer hours and, hence, to return to substantial employment, such
as full-time or part-time work, compared to mothers living in counties with childcare
rationing to return to marginal employment (H3).
Due to a long history of East-West differences in the take-up of formal childcare and the
acceptance of maternal employment, we expect the expansion of childcare availability to have
heterogeneous effects on East and West German mothers. In East Germany using formal
childcare for children older than one year, has been and still is the dominant social norm,
whilst in West Germany, family care still prevails. These differences are also reflected in the
more conservative attitudes towards maternal employment and formal childcare in West
Germany, compared to East Germany. In 2012, only 13 per cent of East German women
agreed with the statement that a child under six is likely to suffer from a working mother
compared to 32 per cent of women in West Germany. With respect to childcare, only 17 per
9

cent of East German mothers stated that care for under-six-year-olds should be provided by
the family, whereas still 42 per cent of West German mothers agreed with the statement
(Schober and Stahl, 2014). We therefore expect the effect of increased availability of lowcost, state-subsidised childcare on maternal employment returns to vary with cultural
acceptance of formal childcare and of maternal employment, however, it is difficult to predict
a priori for whom the effect will be more pronounced. On the one hand, an increased
childcare availability in a region with a high acceptance of maternal employment and formal
childcare take-up, such as East Germany, should encourage mothers to further decrease their
employment interruptions (H4A). On the other hand, East Germany started expanding
childcare at a higher level of availability, and returns to employment among mothers were
already relatively fast; hence, there might exist a certain saturation effect with regard to faster
returns to employment. Alternatively, increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised
childcare might have a stronger impact on the duration of employment interruptions among
mothers in West Germany, where there is greater potential to shorten employment
interruptions due to comparatively long interruption durations prior to the childcare expansion
(H4B).

RESEARCH DESIGN
Data Description
To investigate whether increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare is
associated with shorter employment interruptions among East and West German mothers, we
combine annual administrative records on childcare availability on the county-level
(Kreisebene) from the Federal Statistical Office with individual-level data from the
representative German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) (Wagner, Frick and Schupp 2007). We
use yearly individual and household information and monthly employment histories on East

10

and West German mothers, with a first, second or any higher-order birth between January
2006 and December 2014.
Childcare availability is defined as the annual ratio of under-three-year-olds enrolled in
subsidised childcare to the population of this age group, including half-day or full-day
childcare centres or child-minders.4 Combining administrative county-level data with
individual longitudinal information provides a unique opportunity to exploit, first, temporal
variation from the years 2006 to 2014, second, regional variation between East and West
Germany, and last, county-level variation in childcare availability from several counties in
East and West Germany.
Figure 1 and 2 depicts the gradual increase in low-cost, state-subsidised childcare for
under-three-year-olds over time and the variation around the mean in the East and West
German counties observed in our sample. We observe mothers in counties, where the average
childcare availability for under-three-year-olds increased from 7 to 27 per cent in West
Germany and from 40 to 50 per cent in East Germany between 2006 and 2014. For West
Germany, county-level childcare availability of more than 20 per cent is only observable after
2009 (see Online Appendix Table A1). These changes are comparable to official data on the
increase in childcare availability in all counties across Germany. In the analysis, we utilise a
categorical specification of childcare availability. Beyond this, we test linear, spline, u-shaped
as well as different categorical childcare specifications (available on request), however,
results presented are based on the most robust categorisation.

Method of Analysis
To estimate the probability of returning to employment conditional on not having returned to
work yet and due to the discrete character of the data, we apply discrete event history analysis
(Allison, 1982). More precisely, the piecewise-exponential model allows flexible modelling
of the duration dependency of the baseline hazard and is better suited to handle right-censored
11

observations in the data. Due to the relatively small number of events and a peak in the
baseline hazard after 12 months (i.e. expiry of benefit payment), 24 months or 36 months (i.e.
expiry of job guarantee), we present models using yearly intervals. However, results are
comparable with monthly or half-year intervals.
Our risk set includes all mothers who gave birth, until we observe a return to the labour
market (assigning an interruption of eight weeks to all, whilst employment is legally
prohibited), another birth or the observation is censored. One of the model’s assumptions is
that the time of censoring is independent of the event. We define our dependent variable as a
return to employment whenever the respondent states being employed marginal, part-time or
full-time. To take the differing initial availability of state-subsidised childcare into account,
we estimate separate models for East and West Germany. In a first step, we estimate the
probability of a return to work for all births jointly, which includes first, second and higherorder births (Table 3, M1-M2). In a second step, to identify whether increased childcare
availability has had different impacts on a mother’s employment interruption after a first or a
second birth, we split our samples into returns after a first or a second birth for East and West
German mothers, respectively (Table 3, M3-M6). Since we observe very few mothers with a
higher-order birth, we are unable to analyse these interruptions separately. In a third step, we
examine whether increased childcare availability has a more pronounced effect on mothers’
return-to-work decisions in the second year after childbirth, when income-related parental
leave benefits expire (Figure 3 and 4). In a fourth and final step, we test, using a competing
risks model, whether childcare encourages mothers to return to more substantial forms of
employment, that is, full-time or part-time employment, as opposed to marginal employment
(Table 4).5
We restrict our sample to mothers who gave birth between 2006 and 2014, as annual
official childcare data has only been collected since the start of the childcare expansion in
2006. We exclude women who moved between counties during our observation period to
12

avoid selective moving due to higher childcare availability in some counties, as well as the
oversampled subsamples such as the high-income sample and migration samples.6 Following
common practice, we right-censor observation periods after 6 years if no return is observed.
Similarly, we right-censor spells that end with a birth of another child and instead let another
observation period begin.
In total, we observe mothers in 287 of the 402 counties in Germany, 59 of which are
located in East Germany. Based on all restrictions, our sample includes 1,016 episodes of 860
West German mothers for whom we observe 553 events. For East Germany, we observe 256
episodes of 219 mothers for whom we observe 166 events. 463 episodes of West German
mothers (58 due to another birth) and 90 of East German mothers (12 due to another birth) are
right-censored. The most censoring occurred due to missing information, non-response or a
limited observation period (women with a birth at the end of the observation window are more
often censored).

Control Variables
We control for the following relevant time-constant individual characteristics observed for the
mother prior to childbirth: age, education and migration background, and time-constant prebirth employment characteristics, i.e. employment status (full-time, part-time or not
employed) and the pre-birth hourly log wage adjusted for inflation (in 2011 Euros). We also
include several time-varying control variables: family status (single, cohabitation and
marriage), number of children in the household, if the child was born after the introduction of
the new income-related parental leave benefit scheme in 2007 and log household income
adjusted to inflation (in 2011 Euros).
To capture aspects of the regional economic situation that might influence maternal
employment participation, we include the centred unemployment rate and female labour force
participation rate on the county-level, provided annually by the Federal Statistical Office. In
13

addition, we include the number of marriages per 1000 adult inhabitants, as a proxy for
cultural differences between rural and urban areas and as an indicator for the importance of
traditional family norms. To control for further unobserved influences, we included period
dummies in all models. Table 1 and 2 present the distribution of the control variables for West
and East Germany.

RESULTS
Childcare availability and interruption durations
We utilise a categorical specification of childcare availability. For West Germany, we
differentiate among availability of less than 15 per cent (reference category), between 15 and
22 per cent, and more than 23 per cent. For East Germany, the categories are less than 42 per
cent (reference category), between 42 and 49 per cent, and more than 50 per cent. This
categorisation allows for an approximately equal distribution of the changing childcare
availability over the observation period (see Online Appendix Table A1). At the start of the
observation period in West Germany regional availability of low-cost, state-subsidised
childcare of less than 15 per cent is most common. Capacities of more than 23 per cent are
only available after 2009. For East Germany, increased availabilities also become more
common over our observation period.
We present results for East and West German mothers’ return-to-work behaviour after any
birth in Table 3 (M1 and M2), reporting average marginal effects. Our results show that
increased childcare availability shortens the duration of employment interruptions among
West German mothers and increases their probability of returning to employment. In actual
terms, this means that when the childcare availability in a West Germany county reaches 15
per cent or more but remains below 23 per cent compared to the reference category, the
probability of returning to work increases by one percentage point in any month after birth
14

(M1). Similarly, when childcare is available to more than 23 per cent of all under-three-yearold children in a county, the probability of returning to work increases by two percentage
points in any month after birth (M1). This implies that substantially greater childcare
availability is responsible for faster returns to employment in West Germany. When
individual and regional confounders are included (M2), the childcare coefficients are reduced,
but still statistically significant. Although effect sizes are small, coefficients are generally
comparable to individual and household controls (Online Appendix Table A2 and A3). The
effects of these controls are in line with theoretical considerations and do not contradict other
related studies. For East Germany, the effect of increased availability of low-cost, statesubsidised childcare is positive but statistically insignificant. Overall, this result provides
support for our hypothesis H1 that an increased childcare availability reduces mothers’
employment interruptions following childbirth, but only among West German mothers.
Furthermore, although the East German sample is comparatively small, the results provide
tentative evidence for our hypothesis H4B, which posits a higher potential for West German
mothers to shorten their employment interruptions.

Return-to-work behaviour after first and second childbirth
When turning to the separate estimates for the employment interruption durations after a first
or a second birth in Table 3 (M3-M6), it again becomes evident that considerable childcare
ratio of above 23% is particularly important for West German mothers, especially after a
second childbirth (M5-M6). For first births, estimates are positive but statistically
insignificant, once we include individual and regional controls (M3-M4). This may suggests
that West German mothers might perceive it as less beneficial to return to employment
temporarily before having a second child. Again, for the much smaller sample of East German
mothers, we find a positive although statistically insignificant effect.

Time-dependency of childcare availability on the duration of employment interruptions
To test, whether the effect of increased childcare availability is similar at each point during
the employment interruption (H2), we interact the childcare measure with the time periods.
We provide a graphical demonstration of our results only (full models are available on
request). Figure 3 and 4 illustrate how different levels of childcare availability cause the
predicted probability of returning to work to vary in the first year (0-11 months), second year
(12-23 months), and beyond the third year (24 months and longer) after childbirth for both
West and East German mothers. Including a time-dependent effect of childcare availability in
the model indicates that childcare availability of more than 23 per cent increases West
German mothers’ probability of returning to employment in the second year after childbirth
(Likelihood-Ration test: Chi-value 10.61, p=0.005), providing support for H2. The timedependency effect is neither statistically significant for the first year after childbirth nor for
the third year and beyond (coefficients not shown). Once more, for the smaller sample of East
German mothers, we do not find a statistically significant effect.

Returns to substantial versus marginal employment
In a last step, we focus on the transition to full- and part-time employment, which we refer to
as substantial employment, compared to a transition to marginal employment. Table 4 (M1
and M2) shows again a small and positive effect of increased childcare availability on the
probability of returning to substantial employment only for West German mothers (full
models in Online Appendix Table A4 and A5). The likelihood to return to marginal
employment remains unaltered (M3 and M4). The childcare coefficients are of similar

16

magnitude as in Table 3. The finding provides support for our initial assumption (H3) that
increased childcare availability strengthens mothers’ labour market attachment, since they
return faster and work more hours, particularly for West German mothers.

Table 4 here –

Sensitivity checks
We run several sensitivity checks that reinforce our findings. First, we include the child’s
month of birth in our models to control for increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised
childcare at beginning of the new school year in late August and early September. Second, we
add different measures of mothers’ work commitment to our models to ensure that our results
are not driven by women with a stronger work or career orientation returning to work faster.
Third, we re-estimated all models, without including the county-level marriage rate per 1000
adults to assess whether this control variable is driving our results. Fourth, we exclude births
prior to the introduction of the shortened and income-related parental leave in 2007 to
examine whether returns to work are driven by the new parental leave scheme. Similarly, we
re-estimate all models excluding mothers with a child aged older than one year in August
2013 (144 mothers in West and 23 mothers in East Germany), to ensure that results were not
driven by the introduction of the legal entitlement to a childcare place. In the same vein, we
exclude the three states from our analysis that implemented a legal entitlement to childcare
prior to 2013 (Rhineland Palatinate, Thuringia and Saxony Anhalt). Last, we test for the
possibility of selective panel attrition. However, all sensitivity analyses show similar patterns
and therefore confirm our previous findings (available on request).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Focusing on a major public childcare expansion in Germany, this study provides first
evidence that an increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare for under-three17

year-olds shortens mothers’ employment interruptions after childbirth. By exploiting
exogenous temporal and regional variation in county-level childcare availability in East and
West Germany, we find that increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare
significantly shortens employment interruptions among West German mothers. As the prereform availability and acceptance of formal childcare and maternal employment were low
and interruption durations were comparatively long, West German mothers had a significant
potential to shorten their interruption duration. For the much smaller East German sample, we
find a positive but statistically insignificant effect. The findings for East and West German
mothers suggest that an expansion of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare is more likely to
significantly reduce the interruption duration after childbirth in a relatively traditional context
with previously exceptionally low childcare availability. In contrast, due to the already
comparatively short interruptions prior to the expansion, the potential for even shorter
interruptions may have been limited among East German mothers. Hence, our results lend
support to previous studies, which either find a small or no employment effect of statesubsidised childcare expansions when pre-reform childcare availability is comparatively welldeveloped (e.g., Brilli, Del Boca and Pronzato, 2016; Havnes and Mogstad, 2011; Lundin,
Mörk and Öckert, 2008). However, it is important to keep in mind that we base these findings
on a relatively small sample of East German mothers.
Beyond this, our findings suggest that the effect of increased availability of low-cost, statesubsidised childcare may be particularly pronounced for interruptions following a second
birth. This might suggest that increased childcare availability does not significantly alter
mothers’ return-to-work behaviour if they still plan to have more children. Previous research
supports this argument, showing that West German mothers have a tight spacing of two to
four years between a first and second child (Kreyenfeld, 2008). It seems plausible that West
German mothers, who plan to have a second child, perceive it as difficult to find short-term
care arrangements for their first child and expect employers to be averse to a temporary return
18

to employment. Hence, they may perceive a temporary return to work as less beneficial than a
single but longer employment interruption. Therefore, formal childcare might become
particularly important for faster labour market returns after family planning is likely to have
been completed.
Furthermore, in line with previous research (Geyer, Haan and Wrohlich, 2015; Haan and
Wrohlich, 2011) our results provide additional support that increased availability of low-cost,
state-subsidised childcare increases mothers’ likelihood of returning to employment in the
second year after childbirth when paid leave entitlements expire and childcare becomes
important. The design of the parental leave scheme can serve as an additional explanation for
why increased childcare availability may increase the likelihood of returning to employment
in the second year particularly among West German mothers, compared to East German
mothers. The nature of the paid parental leave entitlement does not make it necessarily
beneficial to have interruption durations below 12 months and to return to work whilst still
entitled to paid leave, as paid leave entitlements are reduced by labour income. This finding
provides tentative evidence that the effect of increased availability of low-cost, statesubsidised childcare depends on other family policies, in particular the income-related
parental leave entitlement. Future research should evaluate how childcare availability interacts
with other policies, which foster the male-breadwinner model and whether heterogeneous
policy effects exist among various social groups and labour market contexts.
Finally, our findings suggest that increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised
childcare plays a significant role in supporting mothers’ returns to substantial employment
(again only statistically significant for West German mothers), whereas the effect of childcare
availability on returns to marginal employment remains unaltered. Differentiating between
mothers with different employment histories and investigating whether more full-time
childcare slots will lead to more full-time employment, particularly in West Germany, should
be examined in further research.
19

A major limitation of our study is the small sample sizes, especially for East Germany, which
did not allow for further subsample analyses. By exploiting temporal and regional variation in
county-level childcare availability and a wide range of individual, household and county-level
controls, we try to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Yet, the risk of biased estimates
remains due to other unobserved characteristics, such as formal childcare quality, which may
correlate with the childcare expansion and maternal employment. Despite these limitations
our findings align with previous studies highlighting the importance of formal childcare for
maternal employment (Morrissey, 2017 for an overview) and provide additional evidence of
how family policy reforms, in our case the increased county-level availability of low-cost,
state-subsidised childcare, significantly encourages reductions in employment interruptions
and enables mothers to return to more substantial employment (part-time or full-time). In the
future, research may observe a larger impact on maternal employment as full-time childcare
slots are increasingly becoming available due to the legal entitlement to childcare. From a
general perspective, our findings emphasise that an institutional change, which strengthens the
dual-earner model, profoundly impacts on mothers’ employment trajectories.

NOTES

1 Despite the lack of state-subsidised childcare availability for under-three-year-olds in West
Germany, incentives for private providers were low due to high-quality requirements and no
or limited subsidies. As a result, up to 2006 less than 2 per cent of children attended for-profit
providers (Spieß, Berger and Groh-Samberg, 2008) and less than 5 per cent used informal
paid care such as nannies or au-pairs (Schober, 2014).

20

2 To date the legal right is not easily enforceable, as only few parents have taken legal action
against regional authorities and these cases are still unsettled. In principle in 2016 the top
court decided that employed parents are entitled to financial compensation (Financial Times,
2016). However, with only few observations available after August 2013, this paper focuses
on the gradual expansion of childcare availability.

3 In light of the limited but state-subsidised childcare in Germany, it appears to be the
availability rather than the cost of childcare that matters (Kreyenfeld and Hank, 2000). Since
state subsidies cover approximately 85 per cent of the costs per slot, parents only pay an
income-dependent fee of approximately 14 per cent of the total costs, which is well below the
OECD average (Schober, 2014).

4 Despite the substantial increase in childcare availability, demand still exceeds the supply in
East and West Germany (BMFSFJ, 2015). As this is constantly monitored, the childcare
attendance rate is considered as a measure of supply rather than demand, which is in line with
previous studies on Germany (for a detailed description, see Kreyenfeld and Hank, 2000).

5 Unfortunately, full-time returns are rarely observed, particularly in West Germany.
Therefore, we define our dependent variable as a substantial return whenever the respondent
states either being employed part-time or full-time.

6 We also run estimates across all the SOEP samples. Although results are comparable, we
present more conservative estimates based on representative samples.
