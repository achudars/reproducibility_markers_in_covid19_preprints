Abstract
Overindulgence in social networking, in general, and texting, in particular, is much in practice. It
is cutting across various population boundaries and has almost assumed an endemic proportion.
Its consequential impact on the standard language has acquired greater importance. This paper
aims to determine the perceptions and attitudes of English Second Language (ESL) learners at
Aligarh Muslim University towards the consequences of texting on Standard English. The data
were collected through a five-point scale questionnaire from ninety students who were enrolled at
Aligarh Muslim University during the academic year 2010-2011. The respondents completed a
16-item questionnaire. The students from which the data were collected were grouped according
to their levels. The results indicate the negative impact of this new usage of the language in
breaking the rules of English language and influencing their literacy. Moreover, the questionnaire
results from respondents' point of view show that regardless of their heavy use of texting, most
respondents have a negative attitude towards texting and they viewed it as a threat to Standard
English.

The Impact of Texting on Standard English: The Students’ Perspective

Ali, Hasnain & Beg

1. Introduction
The prolific use of texting in modern life and its consequent pros and cons are assuming great
importance in the contemporary world. This has also resulted in the divisions and disagreements
among scholars as to its effect on the structure of language. The impact of texting on Standard
English has been studied by a number of scholars. According to Drouin and Davis (2009),
approximately half of their participants in the study reported that texting is making it challenging
to remember Standard English and it could have a negative impact on their usage of Standard
English. Texting is “a language that has swept our world like a tsunami, in less than a decade”
(Swartzlander, 2010, p.vi). Texting has been perceived in different ways by different scholars.
Some scholars have critiqued it on the grounds of distorting English spelling system in the name
of simplification. They believe that simplification of spelling is being carried out with no
consideration to history and pride associated with language. Other scholars believe that there is no
problem with texting as long as one is able to communicate and understand each other through it.
The advent of texting has created many variations of English language and allowed the users to
break the rules of Standard English. Baron (2008) points out that we are flooding the scriptorium
with an abundance of instant and text messages and, as a result, we are unable to distinguish the
important from the unimportant or the great works from the so-called “vapour text”. Baron
maintains “unless we learn to regulate our current language use, we will have difficulty
understanding each other and the standardized forms of our written language will be lost.” (as cited
in Maynard, 2009, p. 2).
The domain of this research will mainly focus on the impact of texting on Standard English
from the students' points of view. The study was conducted at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)
in India, where essentially Urdu is the first language of the students while English is used as a
medium of instruction and it is spoken as a second or a foreign language for most AMU students.
2. Research Questions
The present study aims to achieve some objectives that can be summarized in the following
research questions:
1. What is the impact of texting on Standard English from students' point of view?
2. Are ESL students aware of the impact of texting?
3. Review of Literature
Janin-Starr (2014) states that some researchers found texting to interfere with formal writing, while
other studies demonstrated just the opposite in schoolwork. Janin-Starr maintains that “the issues
with texting can become complicated and confusion”. A similar predicament and anxiety have been
expressed by Baron (2008) when she writes the preface of her book titled: Language in an Online
and Mobile World. “In writing this book, I have felt comparable frustration in attempting to
characterize a phenomenon in flux”(Baron, 2008, p. ix). Irish education officials reported that
“Online commentary gives the impression that the court of public opinion sides with the view that
texting has a poisonous influence on language and literacy” ( Wolman, 2008, p.179). Prøysen (2009)
argues that there seems to be some truth in the prophecy that texting English will erode children's
ability to spell, punctuate and capitalize correctly, and that children will transfer these new habits
into their schoolwork. Prøysen’s fieldwork in the United States supported her hypothesis that high
school students do not keep the language of text messaging separate from Standard English written

texts, so that text messaging language is used in school work. Prøysen’s general argument is that if
one is struggling with the language learning process, and one has to learn a second language in addition
to one's mother tongue, it may be difficult for the weak students to keep up and texting makes things
worse. The corruption of language and the degradation in spelling by students have been noticed
by many teachers across the world. Textism is blamed for this and many teachers have even
formally voiced their complaints of textism creeping into formal “school resister language”.
Teachers have found that texting has crept into formal writing such as papers, forms, tests, projects,
and other forms (Ali, 2012; Vosloo, 2009; Kemp & Bushnell, 2011; Coe & Oakhill, 2011 and
Leedham et al., 2009).
In exploring whether the incessant use of the language of email, SMS, chat and other
electronic media damage the students’ ability to use the Standard language conventions expected
in examinations, Ellis, Daniels, and Jauregui (2010) suggest that the frequent use of cell phone
may have a negative effect on academic performance. Harman and Sato (2011) show a negative
correlation between number of SMS text messages and academic scores. Wood, Kemp, Waldron,
and Hart (2014) find that the text messages of children at both primary and secondary school were
rife with grammatical violations.
Psychologists use the “decay theory” to explain this phenomenon. Decay theory states that
learned information will be less accessible over time, especially when they are not being activated
through use. According to this theory, if individuals are using texting as their main form of
communication, Standard English may deteriorate from disuse (Drouin & Davis, 2009, p. 51).
There is a concern that students who frequently express themselves in abbreviations and smiley
faces may lose the capacity for more nuanced, grammatically correct writing. “A considerable
number of educators and children’s advocates ... are concerned that the quality of writing by young
Americans is being degraded by their electronic communication, with its carefree spelling, lax
punctuation and grammar, and its acronym shortcuts” (Lenhart, Arafeh, Smith, and Macgill, 2008,
p. i). Cingel and Sundar (2012) find a negative association between US children's performance and
their use of textisms. Lee (2002) describes texting as an incessant assault of technology on formal
written English. Ali et al. (2015) found out that texting creates lack of comprehension for English
speakers, learners, and texters.
On the other side, Crystal (2008) believes that the widespread concern about the impact of
texting on children’s literacy is unfounded. The brevity of the text style, and the 160 character
constraint of an SMS, require the author to write economically, inventively and playfully.
Tagliamonte and Denis (2008) suggest that new media language does not interfere with standard
literacy. Many other linguistic studies on texting find that texting doesn't have a negative impact on
language (Al-kadi , 2017; Ahmed & Al-kadi, 2016; Grinter & Eldridge, 2001, 2003; Faulkner &
Culwin, 2004 and Doring, 2002).Farina and Lyddy (2011) argue that text messaging language is
not as deviant as media portrays. Furthermore, the use of textisms is found to correlate positively
with word reading, vocabulary and phonological awareness in children, and some aspects of
language performance in young adults. Hamzah, Ghorbani and Abdullah (2009) find that the
written language is being creatively adapted, developed, and enhanced to suit the conditions of the
electronic communication age. Syntactical and lexical reductions are just strategies used to reduce
effort, time and space. The authors believe texting is perfectly acceptable for use in text messages,

but school work, formal letters, business communication and examinations require standard
language.
4. Methods
4.1. Subjects Selection
The sample of this research consisted of ninety AMU subjects from Aligarh Muslim University,
India. They were grouped according to their levels of education: Plus Two, Bachelor, Master and
PhD. Twenty subjects from Faculty of Commerce, 20 subjects from Faculty of Science and 20
subjects from Faculty of Arts. Faculty of Social Sciences and Faculty of Engineering and
Technology did not have Plus Two level. Therefore, the subjects were 15 from Faculty of Social
Sciences and 15 Faculty of Engineering and Technology. The authors selected Plus Two level
which refers to a one year course between secondary school and bachelor degree. This group has
been selected because they are somewhat younger.
4.2. Instrument
The instrument of this research was a questionnaire of 16 items. The alternative responses were
fixed and close-ended. The responses of the close-ended questions are simple to administer and
easy to analyze. The statements in the questionnaire of the study were the five-point scale and the
responses were graded from ‘Strongly Agree’ to ‘Strongly Disagree'. The sequencing of the
questions/statements was achieved by taking KAP (Knowledge, Attitude and Practice) as a formula
for sequence. The questionnaire was refereed by experts of designing and experts of statistical
analysis before its final distribution. The completed questionnaires were transferred to a text file
and then analysed by to SPSS version 16.0 for analysis.
4.3. Procedure of Data Interpretation
After analysing the data and presenting the results in tables supported by graphs where necessary,
the results of the data analyses were interpreted in details. In other words, the results found were
presented in a written form. The consolidation and inferring were declared throughout the statistical
analysis and results interpretation section. Then the findings were stated out in conclusion.
5. Statistical Analysis and Results Interpretation
In this section, the data were statistically analysed and interpreted. The respondents' responses to
the questionnaire items were presented in tables.

around ‘agree’ and ‘neutral’ options. Generally speaking, the level of agreement showed that most of
the respondents use code mixing when they contacted through texting.
6. Conclusions and suggestions
After a thorough analysis of the data, it was found that the respondents had a negative attitude
towards texting and they viewed it as causing a negative impact on the structure of Standard English.
Lenhart, Arafeh, Smith, and Macgill (2008, p. i) state that a number of educators and children’s
advocates are “concerned that the quality of writing by young Americans is being degraded by their
electronic communication”. Janin-Starr (2014, p. 45) states that “As dropping consonants and vowels
and poor punctuation become a habit, this may destroy one’s reading and writing skills.” Regarding
the difference between the level groups in their knowledge and opinion about texting, there was no
significant difference between the level groups. A significant difference between the level groups was
only seen in their responses on the statement “Email, SMS and chat are destroying English
language”. It was found that no respondent of Plus Two level disagreed with the statement “Email,
SMS and chat are destroying English language. This shows that even the young respondents believe
that texting destroys English language.
Further studies should be conducted on meta-data analysis of the researches that have earlier
been carried out on texting. This proposed meta-data analysis, including qualitative and quantitative
studies on texting, will provide useful insights and recommendations. These, in turn, will present a
clearer picture of the effects of texting on Standard English.
