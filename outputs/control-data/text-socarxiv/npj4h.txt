Abstract
Identifying and monitoring Open Access (OA) publications might seem a trivial task while practical efforts
prove otherwise. Contradictory information arise often depending on metadata employed. We strive to assign
OA status to publications in Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus while complementing it with different sources
of OA information to resolve contradicting cases. We linked publications from WOS and Scopus via DOIs and
ISSNs to Unpaywall, Crossref, DOAJ and ROAD. Only about 70% of articles and reviews from WOS and
Scopus could be matched via a DOI to Unpaywall. Matching with Crossref brought 53 distinct licences, which
define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. But only 53% of publications hold only a
single licence on Crossref, while more than 42% have no licence information submitted to Crossref. Contrasting
OA information from Crossref licences with Unpaywall we found contradictory cases overall amounting to more
than 13%, which might be partially explained by (ex-)including green OA. A further manual check found about
17% of OA publications that are not accessible and about 15% non-OA publications that are accessible through
publishers’ websites. These preliminary results suggest that identification of OA state of publications denotes a
difficult and currently unfulfilled task.

Introduction
Open access (henceforth OA) in scholarly communication describes unrestricted access to
published peer-reviewed documents written by and addressed to researchers. These
documents have traditionally been disseminated via publications in scientific journals, which
charge for access to the respective content. Stimulated by a call for greater openness and
transparency in general (“open science”), the OA movement has nowadays been accepted as
one, though not the only, alternative for the dissemination of scholarly documents. Even
publishers seem to embrace this new model as providing a suitable infrastructure while at the
same time securing their own economic interests.
This inter-mixture of interests has resulted not only in one, but several forms of OA
publications such as Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid, Green, Delayed, Bronze and Black which
are mainly based on right to access and pay to publish models depending on venues where the
OA publication is accessible.
Due to the individual ascription of single publications to one or several of these categories and
the decentralized structure of the scientific publishing market with a variety of diverse
publishers, the identification of OA is less trivial than it might seem. Even large bibliometric
data provider rely on external information to provide information on OA1 and most large scale
undertakings by the scientometric community to obtain reliable information on OA
prevalence rely on the use of web crawlers (Archambault et al., 2013; Piwowar et al., 2018)
Inspired by the Hybrid OA Dashboard (Jahn, 2017) we applied licensing information
detailing the legally binding access state supplied by publishers to the publisher association
Crossref to identify OA publications. We determined the OA status of all publications
retrieved from Web of Science (henceforth WOS) and Scopus in-house databases of 2017 by
confronting them to two sources of OA information, i.e., Unpaywall and Crossref. In Section
2, we present our data and methods. In Section 3 we present our findings, while we discuss
our main results in Section 4.

Data & Method
We queried all publications from Scopus and WOS in in-house databases of 2017. Data
included article’s unique ID from database and DOI. We matched those DOIs with Unpaywall
database from April 18th 2018 to determine the OA status for each single publication. In
parallel, we matched those DOIs with Crossref data (using snapshot of the data from April
2018 based on plus service described in Crossref (2018)) and retrieved the available
information on the licences of publications2.
Additionally, we used the journals’ ISSNs provided by Wohlgemuth, Rimmert, &
Winterhager (2016) (and the updated version in Rimmert, Bruns, Lenke, & Taubert (2017)) to
identify Gold OA publications. They use different known OA indexes (e.g., DOAJ 3
(Directory of Open Access Journals) and ROAD4 (Directory of Open Access scholarly
Resources) and determine if the respective ISSN is listed in those databases. They
differentiate between ISSN and ISSNL which is more fine-grained by adding a specific ISSN
to some special issues. We tried both ISSN and ISSNL, since the latter had higher matching
records, therefore in our analysis presented in the Results section we use the ISSNL.
It is necessary to note that some publications had multiple licence URLs in Crossref database,
we followed a procedure with four steps to ensure using only one licence per publication (see
Table 2 for the frequencies of these publications):
1. If a publication had only one record in Crossref database, whether it had an OA, non-OA,
unclear licence or no licence information (i.e. NA), we used this status and categorized the
publication as a unique one.
2. If a publication had multiple OA licence URLs, we removed the duplicates and categorized
it as OA.
3. If a publication had a mixture of OA and non-OA licence URLs, we removed the duplicates
and categorized it as OA.
4. If a publication had multiple non-OA licence URLs, we removed the duplicates and
categorized it as non-OA.
A research assistant controlled the unique licences (a total of 56) we extracted from Crossref
with available information online to categorize them as OA and non-OA. We used this
categorization in parallel to established OA identification procedures (e.g., searching for
journal’s ISSN in DOAJ and ROAD in Gold OA identification) to ensure a higher level of
robustness in our results.
In OA Identification process and in order to determine if a publication was OA or not, we
applied a multi-category view separating Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA, while
doing so, we reached a new category of Probable Hybrid OA. Our investigation strategy for
each category was as follows:
• Gold OA: As described earlier, we used the ISSNs provided by Rimmert et al. (2017) to
determine Gold OA. We matched the respective ISSN (from both WOS and Scopus) with
DOAJ and ROAD. If the respective ISSN was listed in one of those directories, the
publication is categorized as Gold OA. We confronted Gold OA from DOAJ and ROAD
with our research assistant’s categorization of Crossref licences after the manual check of
unique licence URLs.
• Hidden Gold OA: we used metadata from WOS and Scopus to determine the journal issue
and looking at the licences of all publications in a single issue, if all publications had OA
2 It is neccessary to note that our effort to send large number of requests to Crossref API (even while using plus service and through both
rcrossref package in R and more fine-grained httr requests directly to Crossref API) faced timeout and response time errors and alternatively
we chose to use the in-house snapshot of the Crossref data to circumvent the above error. This meant parsing large corpus of JSON files
which can be time consuming depending on the goals of the analysis. Any effort on automating the proposed OA identification procedure
needs to overcome the technical issues like this.

licences, but the ISSN was not indexed in DOAJ or ROAD we categorized it as Hidden
Gold OA.
Hybrid OA: If an issue had at least one non-OA publication while having one or more OA
publications, we categorized the OA publications as Hybrid OA.
Probable Hybrid OA: If an issue did not have a non-OA publication while having one or
more OA publications and some publications in the issue didn’t have licence information,
we categorized them as Probable Hybrid OA.
Delayed OA: In all of the above cases, we looked into delays based on Crossref metadata
(a difference in terms of days from day of publication and the date licence was assigned to
the publication as described in CrossRef-API (2019), this is the time period known as
embargo time) to determine if they were Delayed, therefore each of the above categories
were split to two groups, delayed and not-delayed. If a publication had multiple licence
URLs on Crossref, we controlled their respective delay times, if any of those were notdelayed we categorized the publication as such, while if any of the licences were delayed,
the publication is identified as a delayed one.
Closed Access: Strictly speaking, if the number of publications in an issue was equal to the
number of non-OA publications and the ISSN was not indexed in DOAJ or ROAD, we
categorized them as Closed Access.
NA (Not available): A publication that was not fitting in any of the above categories or did
not have a licence URL to determine its condition was categorised as NA. Number of NAs
are higher than Closed Access publications, since we aimed to keep the definitions as strict
as possible.

Results
We present the results in two main sections, one regarding Unpaywall and the other on
licences extracted from Crossref. We then present the comparison between Unpaywall and
Crossref and the results of our manual checks on random samples for robustness of the
results.
Table 1 shows the number of articles and review papers from WOS and Scopus with an
equivalent record in Unpaywall database. It presents also the total number of articles and
review papers in WOS/Scopus to provide a baseline for comparison. Unpaywall has close to
70% coverage in both cases while coverage of WOS is slightly higher (can be due to different
indexing philosophy or DOIs completeness). In the following tables (in Unpaywall results),
publications are limited to only articles and review papers published in 2000-2017.

Figure 1 presents the distribution of journals and publications indexed in WOS (top) and
Scopus (bottom) matched with Unpaywall database and crosschecked the ISSNs with DOAJ.
Missing on DOAJ in these Figures refer to those journals whose ISSN was missing from
Rimmert et al. (2017) data, therefore we could not check if the ISSN is listed in DOAJ or not
while Others means the ISSN was existing in Rimmert et al. (2017) but it was not listed as
OA in DOAJ. Share of publications which don’t have a matching ISSN in DOAJ (meaning
they are not Gold OA) and are identified as OA in Unpaywall is interesting on both Figures

(designated with “Missing on DOAJ | Unpaywall OA” as label). They could be other OA
types (green, hybrid, hidden gold).

crosschecked the ISSNs with DOAJ (Gold OA) between 2000 and 2016

We matched publications to Crossref data from April 2018 and found 56 distinct licence types
for all of the publications. Table 2 presents a descriptive view on whether publications have
licence information recorded in Crossref. It shows that about 43% of publications from WOS
or Scopus with a matching DOI indexed in Crossref do not have a licence URL. Some of the
publications had more than one licence information in Crossref (as an example, the number of
DOIs that each have 6 licence records on Crossref are 1,152). In case of multiple licences, if a
publication had at least one OA licence, we categorized it as OA.

Figure 2 present the Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA status of the publications
from WOS (top) and Scopus (bottom), which is presented as trends over the years. We limited
the years to 2000-2017 to show the most recent trends. To make these Figures more readable,
we removed NA (those without a matching DOI or without a licence information on
Crossref).

Tables 3 and 4 present the OA status comparison between Unpaywall and Crossref in WOS
and Scopus publications, respectively. Note, Crossref OA status in the Tables is the
categorization we developed using respective licence URLs. We double checked the
contradictory cases and improved our while-list of OA licences, while some of the
contradictions still remain (e.g., Unpaywall declares those publications as OA while they are
closed access or vice versa, in case of licences on Crossref that are open access while the
publication is declared as non-OA on Unpaywall). Overall contradictory cases amount to
22.98 % in WOS and 22.91% in Scopus which might partly be explained by the wider scope
of Unpaywall including also green OA publications that might not be identified via license
information only.

Tables 5 and 6 present the result of our research assistant’s manual check for accessibility to
article’s PDF file from publishers websites compared to the respective licence in Crossref and

the OA status we manually assigned to those URLs in contrast to OA status from Unpaywall.
It is interesting to see there are publications defined as Non-OA while their PDF is accessible
from the publisher (14.42% in WOS and 14.54% in Scopus) or vice versa, OA publications
(based on either Unpaywall, Crossref or both) that are not accessible online (17.57% in WOS
and 16.74% in Scopus). Note also the contradictory cases between Crossref and Unpaywall,
where metadata from one shows OA and the other Closed, which requires further probes
(22.98% in WOS and 22.91% in Scopus, these percentages are quite close to contradictions
observed in the overall sample presented in Tables 3 and 4). Our effort to complement these
databases proves that none of them could be used in isolation. We aim to follow-up and use
PDF URLs provided by Unpaywall in large scale to control the ratio of publications which
can be accessed.

Conclusions
It is clear that publishing as OA is on the rise in recent years. This trend is observed similarly
in WOS and Scopus (while Scopus has higher raw publication counts but trends are identical)
and based on OA identification stemming from both Unpaywall and Crossref. But still the
majority of publications are closed access. We observed that despite the high coverage of
Unpaywall (close to 70% of articles and reviews in both WOS and Scopus), it doesn’t provide
enough metadata (as of April 2018) for OA categorization thus could be limiting for large
scale OA monitoring in the leading bibliometric databases. Licence information from Crossref
is more detailed and it gives a good possibility to complement Unpaywall metadata. Although
we overcame the downsides by complementing these databases, we still found further
contradictions between them with manual random checks. Some publications were OA (based
on their licences or Unpaywall status) while their PDF files were not accessible through
publishers’ websites. Some publications were closed access, while their PDF files were

accessible. We found that the issue of multiple records for some publications or multiple
licence information is something that needs to be seriously considered in OA monitoring.
While we tried to test different scenarios in OA identification, still there are publications that
won’t fit into any of the scenarios and we had to categorize them as NA (since we wanted to
keep the Closed Access definition as strict as possible), these are the publications that need to
be further studied and usually the metadata of the OA databases are lacking for them. We
propose OA monitoring activities to try to benefit from our approach in complementing the
metadata from OA databases, i.e. Unpaywall and Crossref, while noting that there are
contradictions between these sources. Our effort to complement these databases proves that
none of them could be used in isolation.
