Abstract
This current study aimed to investigate the influence of derivational and inflectional morphological
awareness on the writing of undergraduate students studying English as a Foreign Language. They
were divided in to two groups and each group comprised 200 advanced EFL learners. Explicit
morphological instructions were given to group two in the classroom for full one semester whereas
group one wasn't given any kind of morphological knowledge. To collect data, exactly the same
lists of word-formation on different morphological processes and their use in the writing samples
were administered to both the groups. The main objective of this research was to examine the
correlation between the morphological awareness and the EFL writing after testing learners'
reflection on word-formation. Then it also tried to explore the difference between their
performances to check whether the morphological instructions improved their writing or not. The
findings stated that group two students always performed far better than group one and showed a
strong understanding of word-formation structure while applying and manipulating in the
morphological-instructed tasks. The formulated hypothesis-the teaching of explicit morphemic
rules improves not only morphological awareness to a large extent but also grammatical,
intralingual, lexical and syntactic awareness that results to enhance collaboratively EFL writing
competence. A promising contribution of this current study to pedagogy was that explicit teaching
of morphology improved writing to a concrete, large extent and revealed clearly that it must be
introduced to EFL learners from the early education so that their writing skill can be developed
effectively.

The Influence of Derivational and Inflectional Morphological

Wahid & Farooq

Foreign language learning depends mainly on its lexical knowledge. Morphology is the study of
the words, their formation, and their relationship to other lexemes in the same language, and it is
an essential factor in building a foreign language vocabulary. With the development of vocabulary,
foreign language learners achieve target language proficiency and accuracy. According to
Carstairs-McCarthy, (2002), Yule (2010) and Aronoff and Fudeman, (2011), morphology analyzes
the structure of words and parts of words, such as stems, roots, prefixes, and suffixes. It looks
at the parts of speech, intonation, and stress, and the ways context can change a word's grammar,
pronunciation, and meaning. This paper discusses the influence of inflectional and derivational
morphology on EFL text at the undergraduate level and attempts to examine the correlation and
contribution of morphological awareness to EFL writing, and takes into consideration affixation
and some other morphemic processes as variables, to measure the data, which students come across
while forming words. These processes include derivation, inflection, internal change and
suppletion. The paper focuses mainly the morphological awareness that is referred as “the
awareness of the morphemic structure of words and the ability to reflect on and manipulate that
structure” (Carlisle, 1995, p. 194) and its effect on EFL writing.
1. Theoretical Framework
1.1. Morpheme & Affixation
Free (roots) and bound (affixes) are two types of morphemes (Carstairs-McCarthy, 2002).
Affixation is a morphological process whereby an affix, is added (before, after or within) to
a morphological base or a word stem to form a new word. It is a grammatical part that is combined
with a word, stem, or phrase to create copied and modified forms. Most English words are made
up of the base word known as root which contains the heart of the meaning of the word. Prefix is
an attached affix at the beginning of the root while a suffix has it at the end of a word. The process
of adding these affixes to the roots is referred to affixation and the root is the key to building new
lexemes (Coates, 1999). For example, ‘advantage’, ‘forgive’, ‘measure’ are the roots in
‘disadvantageous’, ‘unforgivable’ and ‘immeasurable’.
1.2. Derivational Morphology
Derivational morphology derives new words by altering the lexical category of a word (Lieber,
2004 & 2009). In English, derivational morphology can be both prefixes and suffixes unlike
inflection. Derivation forms a new lexical category or a meaning distinct from that of its base
through the process of affixation (Booij, 2007). For example, if ‘-er’ is added to a verb base ‘sell’,
it results in a noun ‘seller’. When derived words are produced, they become independent lexical
items that receive their own entry in a speaker’s mental lexicon (Pinker, 1999). Acquiring
derivational morphology requires a long time and conscious efforts to develop it completely (Tyler
& Nagy, 1990). There are two types of derivational suffixation: Class 1 and Class 2.
1.2.1. Class 1 Suffixation
In this type of suffixation, the affixes are mostly Latinate. According to Vanderweide, O’Grady,
Aronoff and Rees-Miller, (2002), this type of suffixation normally trigger phonological changes
either in the consonant or vowel segments of the base with which they occur. In addition, they

usually affect the assignment of stress. For instance, ‘-ive’ suffix in the word ‘product’ as
‘productive’ shifts stress to a second syllable or ‘-ial’ in ‘part-ial’, here, final consonant of the
base changes from /t/ to /ʃ/.
1.2.2. Class 2 Suffixation
Unlike class 1 suffixation, class 2 suffixes (which are mostly native) usually don’t trigger any
phonological change. Merrifield, Naish, Rensch and Story (2003) say that this kind of suffixation
is neutral, having no effect on the segmental make-up of the base or on stress assignment such as
‘-en’ added to ‘dark’ resulted in neutral sound ‘darken’.
1.2. Inflection Morphology
All languages have grammatical contrasts such as singular versus plural, and past versus nonpast. Inflection often marks this contrast to indicate the grammatical subclass to which it belongs:
the base to which an inflectional affix is added is sometimes called a stem. In the case of English
nouns, for instance, normally the inflectional affix ‘-s’ as in ‘chair-chairs’ is added to indicate the
plural subclass. In the case of verbs, on the other hand, inflection marks a grammatical distinction
between the past and non-past forms of a verb usually by adding the suffix ‘-ed’ to point out the
past tense like ‘talk-talked’ or it can be said that inflections are only grammatical variants of one
lexeme (Carstairs-McCarthy, 2002). Berko (1958) and Brown (1973) are of view that inflections
are easily acquired by children as well as by second language learners.
1.2.1. Internal change
It is a process that replaces one non-morphemic segment for another, as shown in the pairs of
words ‘sit-sat’, ‘foot-feet’, ‘goose-geese’, etc. (Vanderweide, O’Grady, Aronoff & Rees-Miller,
2002). A verb such as ‘sit’, forms its past tense by changing the vowel. The term ‘ablaut’ is often
used for vowel alternations that mark grammatical contrasts in this way. Ablaut can be
distinguished from umlaut, which involves the fronting of a vowel under the influence of a front
vowel in the following syllable, for example, 'foot-feet'.
1.2.2. Suppletion
It is a morphological process whereby morpho-syntactic element of a lexeme is substituted by
a phonologically unrelated form in order to indicate a grammatical contrast (Hippisley,
Chumakina, Corbett & Brown, 2004). A simple example of suppletion is the use of ‘went’ and
‘was-were’ as the past tense form of the verbs ‘go’ and ‘be’.
Further, the paper discusses the students' use of morphological processes or rules in the
formation of words before and after being taught morphology. It also analyses the ways students
apply these rules and according to that analysis, the solutions/strategies are implicated for the
correct formation of lexemes in the writing of EFL students.
2. Literature Review
There are abundant studies on the influence and correlation of morphology with different
language skills especially with vocabulary building and reading comprehension. As morphology
has a very important role in language learning and learning morphology is an essential part of
language learning like the other language structural and grammatical components. Many
researchers like Agustín Llach (2010), Ramirez, Chen, Gena and Luo (2011), Zhang and Coda

(2013) and Zhang (2017) have focused mainly on the relation of morphology and reading
comprehension. Zhang and Koda (2013) have conducted an investigation on young EFL Chinese
learners’ morphological awareness and its contribution to reading comprehension. According to
this study, morphological proficiency is achieved by students’ first language morphological
knowledge and L2 lexical exposure. This investigation finds that derivational and compound
awareness among the students are related and contributes to EFL reading comprehension. Another
study by Zhang (2017) again emphasizes the contribution of morphological awareness to English
reading comprehension. This longitudinal study investigates derivational morphological
competence two times with an interval of one year. This research claims about a significant role
of derivational morphology in English reading comprehension. Another study (Agustín Llach,
2010) shows a clear relationship between the reading and writing of L2 students. High level of L2
proficiency (aware of morphological rules) students perform better in reading and writing at the
same time than the students with less L2 proficiency or morphological awareness. The average
learners also indicate a relationship between their L2 reading competence and writing competence.
Word-formation has a key role in developing spelling, vocabulary, grammar, wordrecognition, production of different lexical categories, and it facilitates not only reading, grammar,
vocabulary but also lexical processing and writing, or overall learning (Masrai, 2016).
Consequently, learning morphology cannot be avoided. Actually, it should be taught explicitly like
other skills of language. Teachers and curriculum designers must pay an equal attention to
morphology like teaching and designing curriculum of any other skill. Bowers and Kirby (2009)
and Tabatabaei and Yakhabi (2011) examine morphological instruction and its effect on
vocabulary learning. Both the studies find out a significant relationship between the English as
second language learners' vocabulary performance and morphological knowledge. Saeidi and
Mirzapour's (2013) investigation has tried to explore the role of morphological awareness in
listening comprehension. They have experimented on twenty participants who have been
administered four short listening conversations with morphemic structures of thirty token words
in the pre-test. Then, after the four sessions, four short listening passages have been again used for
the post-test. The research shows that the students do well in listening comprehension after getting
morphological instructions.
Much less research has examined the effect of morphological awareness on writing
competence. A very specific study by Engber (1995) reports how morphological knowledge
develops lexical components of a second language. She concludes the results of her research that
the ESL learners with lexical competence score holistically in written compositions. Moreover,
Crossley and McNamara (2009 & 2010) explore that L2 students’ proficiency is related to
morphological and lexical features in their writing tasks. Furthermore, Kieffer and Lesaux (2007)
and Karimi (2012) explain in their research that learners with morphological knowledge can easily
break words into their meaningful production; this ability builds up not only their vocabulary but
also a better understanding of reading and a good command over writing comprehension. Next,
Kieffer and Lesaux’s (2012) investigation on Spanish, Filipino, and Vietnamese speaking learners,
as well as native English speakers, reveal that derivational morphological awareness boosts
students’ cognition to guess word meanings; consequently, derivational morphology guides in
developing a better knowledge of understanding words and texts via reading vocabulary. One more
study (Ginsberg, Honda, & O’Neil, 2011) also assures that morphological knowledge acts for

building up the comprehension of complex words and the ability of reading and writing
competence. Some other studies like Kielar and Joanisse (2010) distinguish several responses to
inflectional morphology: regular, irregular and internal change/suppletion. These researchers
advocate that regular and irregular inflections are processed differently, and the difference and
production might be affected by orthographic, phonological, semantic, formal and informal
factors.
Overall, there is no significant research or evidence that shows a direct contribution of
morphological knowledge to EFL writing. However, all these studies tend to focus on the
importance of morphological awareness in learning different language skills or overall learning a
language. Therefore, it remains a question whether different types of morphological awareness
have a significant effect or correlation on writing comprehension.
3. Analytical Framework
The research has been designed to analyze the morphological awareness among Saudi fourth
year undergraduate learners’ writing. The study has three measures: intralingual, phonological and
grammatical processes to investigate the students’ morphological errors. The main purpose of the
investigation is to find out how morphology affects EFL writing and how it contributes as a tool
of learning to enhance writing skill. To meet the goals of the research, the answers were sought to
the following questions.
1. Do EFL learners have enough morphological awareness to use different lexical categories
of words in their writing? If not, does the teaching of morphology improve their
performance in EFL writing?
2. Is their performance the same or different in derivational and inflectional morphology, and
whether they know properly the regular and irregular base forms and affixation?
3. What are the reasons that affect their morphological knowledge and how does their writing
get affected by their vocabulary and morphological performance?
4. How can the explicit teaching of morphological rules improve their writing?
4. Methods
4.1. Participants
For this empirical study, the data was collected from the two groups. Each group comprised
two hundred fourth-year undergraduate Saudi students. Group one was not taught morphology
explicitly in the class whereas group two had studied morphology for four months explicitly in the
class. However, both the groups had already known about vocabulary building (some basic rules
of affixation along with other common words) and had enough FL exposure, EFL learning
experience, but group two had morphological awareness to a larger extent. They share almost the
same age, level of learning, experience and homogenous linguistic background of Arabic as their
first language.
4.2. Materials
The researchers prepared seven morphology tasks adapted from Vanderweide, O’Grady,
Aronoff & Rees-Miller (2002) and Carstairs-McCarthy (2002): in the task one and two, they were
asked to add class 1 and class 2 derivational suffixes into words; in the task three and four, to add

regular and irregular prefixes; in the task five, the regular and irregular inflectional suffixes and in
the task six and seven, zero affixation like internal change (only inflectional) and suppletion (See
Appendix). Each task comprised of four different words. Both the groups formed the words for
the same instructed tasks and after that, they were asked to use them in sentences. The data was
analyzed through the following variables: correct and incorrect morphological forms, avoidance,
overgeneralization (a vague expression to the point of inaccuracy/an application of a language rule
too broadly), lexical category incomprehension and morphophonemic unawareness. All the
variables were counted manually and then the statistics (the percentage and mean score) was
calculated.
It was hypothesized that teaching of morphology directly in the classrooms affect EFL writing
on a large basis. When the students don’t know morphemic processes, either they overgeneralize
one rule to exceptions, avoid or they make errors in the understanding of lexical category and its
place of occurrence in a sentence due to less morphological and syntactic awareness. Group two
who had the knowledge of morphology was likely to make fewer errors in the production of
different lexemes and in the writing task comparatively to group one who didn’t study morphology.
4.3. Procedure
In this experimental study, the concrete derivational and inflectional morphology was explicitly
taught to group two students for one semester in contrast to group one. Both the groups were
previously aware of vocabulary building (they had studied it in the beginning levels of graduation).
Group two was given morphological instruction around in twenty classes for the entire derivational
and inflectional morphological pedagogy with different kinds of exercises and drills. After that,
the questionnaire was made and distributed among both the groups to examine the difference
between their writing and the influence of morphological instruction on the second group's writing
and to investigate morphological awareness effects on the EFL writing.
5. Results and Analysis
In this section, an overview of data is presented through the percentage and mean value of
formulated words in the questionnaire. First, the results of the research are compared between both
the groups: their incorrect and correct use of morphology and the avoidance of words due to
students’ lack of morphological unawareness. Then the obtained results have been calculated and
figured out on the basis of intralingual and grammatical processes e.g., overgeneralization, lexical
category incomprehension, unawareness of morphophonemic rules leading to semantic change and
errors in the formation of affixation that in turn results in the errors in writing.
Tables -1, 2, 3 and 4 demonstrate the percentage and mean value of derivational morphology:
suffixes (class 1 and class 2), prefixes (regular and irregular), inflectional morphology: suffixes
(regular and irregular), zero suffixes (internal change and suppletion) which are elicited from both
the groups’ reflections on morphological awareness and the reasons of making morphological
errors. Each group had 200 students.

According to table -1 and figure -1, it was observed that when group one didn’t have knowledge
of morphological rules, either many of them produced words incorrectly or some preferred to
avoid. The mean score for avoidance in class 1 suffixation was 5 and 15 in class 2, and the
percentage was 2.5% in class 1 and 7.5% in class 2 suffixation as shown in figure 1. In regular
prefixes, it was more (40), (20%) and 0 in irregular prefixes. Unlike one, group two didn’t avoid.
It shows that these students were very confident because of their morphological knowledge. For
group one, the percentage and mean score of the incorrect forms were 47.5% and 95 respectively
in class 1 and 15% and 30 mean score in class 2 derivational suffixation because class 1 is more
complex than class 2. In comparison to regular prefixes (17.5% and 35 mean value), the percentage

and average score were very high (45% and 90 average score) in irregular prefixes. The percentage
of correct forms was 50%, 77.5%, 62.5% and 55 % with the mean score 100, 155, 125 and 110 in
class 1, class 2 suffixes, regular and irregular prefixes respectively. Comparatively to group one,
group two’s performance was far better. This group formed words incorrectly only in class 1 (5%
and 10 mean value) and in class 2 suffixes 2.5% and the mean score was 5. In regular and irregular
prefixes, this group formed all the words correctly.

was relatively much lower (15) 7.5% only because in class 2 derivational morphology, there are
no morphophonemic rules. Group one students just added suffixes. Here, their FL exposure
facilitated them but in class 1 derivational suffixation, many of them failed to apply the
morphophonemic rules. These findings indicated a significant difference between both the groups,
as group two’s performance was far better in deriving a new word from the root and the mean
score of class 1 suffixation was only 10 (5%) and in class 2, it was 0 (0%). It showed that explicit
teaching of morphology helps students a lot in forming new words and writing them correctly in
written tasks. Further, the mean and percentage of irregular prefixes, among group one, was very
high (80) and (40%) whereas in regular, it was moderately lower (20) and (10%). Contrastively,
group two didn’t make even a single error.
5.1.2. Morphophonemic Unawareness
In this category, group one learners make some errors because they aren’t aware of
morphophonemic process. In class 1 derivational suffixation, the mean score was 15 (7.5%) while
in class 2, it was 0 (0%) because only class 1 derivation includes morphophonemic rules. The mean
for irregular prefixes was 80 (40%) that is again high because to do it accurately, the study of
morphophonology is required. Whereas in regular prefixes, some errors which were 20 (10%) were
made and comparatively very lower than irregular prefixes. Group two marked a very significant
contrast as this group formed all the words correctly in the lists and in the sentences.
5.1.3. Lexical category incomprehension
To write the sentences correctly, morphological as well as syntactic awareness is a must. Hence,
this measure: lexical category incomprehension checks whether the learners are aware of the word
class of given words and can they form different parts of speech through suffixation or not? It also
shows how morphological awareness develops their grammatical awareness. The result for this
measure, in group one, was 30% and 60 mean score in class 1 derivational suffixation while in
class 2, it was 7.5% and 15 mean score. It shows that the morphological incompetency affected
clearly the grammatical competence whereas the experimental group clarified that their
morphological knowledge helped them produce different lexical categories of a word since the
results for them were 0%. The data (table -2 & figure -2) clearly indicates that the study of
morphology clears the concept of lexical category change too.

5.2. Inflectional Morphology
In inflectional suffixation (regular and irregular), internal change and suppletion, the mean of
avoidance was 10, 20, 15 and percentage was 5%, 10%, 7.5% (illustrated in table -3 and figure 3) respectively while totally different from group one, group two didn’t show any trace of
avoidance since the members of this group opted all the words. Further, the control group applied
incorrect affixation higher than the experimental group e.g., 15% with 30 mean score in regular
and irregular suffixes, 35% (70 mean value) in internal change and 20% (40 mean) in suppletion
while the second group produced incorrectly only 2.5% with 5 mean score, 5% (10 mean score) in
suffixes and internal change and 0% in suppletion. For the experimental group, the results were
significantly very low in comparison to the first group. So, it can be summed up that group one
performed correctly 80% (160 mean) whereas the performance of group two was 17.5% higher
with 97.5% and 195 mean score in regular and irregular suffixation. In internal change, the
frequency of correct forms in group two was 95% with 190 mean score relatively almost double
to the production of group one that was 55% (110 mean score). In suppletion, the second group
supplied all the words correctly and the first group members again showed the lack of
morphological knowledge because they supplied 72.5% (145 mean value). Thus, it can be stated
that they underperformed to a large extent.

5.2.1. Overgeneralization
Group one overgeneralized the morphemic rules 7.5% (15 means) in regular and irregular
suffixes, particularly in irregular ones. In internal change, overgeneralization was more (12.5%)
with 25 mean score, and in suppletion, it was a little lower (10%) with 20 mean score. In
comparison to group one, group two didn’t overgeneralize at all. It shows that they had
morphological awareness as they always reflected on and manipulated the instructional
morphological structure to the given words.
5.2.2. Morphophonemic Unawareness
For this category, the first group exhibited morphophonemic unawareness 2.5% only in the
regular and irregular suffixation and the mean score was 5. On the other hand, the second group
didn’t make any mistake in any of these categories. As discussed earlier, internal change
substitutes a vowel, a non-morphophonemic segment in a word whereas suppletion supplies a new
word either completely or partially and doesn’t require any morphophonemic change too. To use
internal change and suppletion, the learners don’t need to know morphophonemic rules and they
apply only the knowledge of morphological processes. Therefore, no traces of this measure were
seen in the findings for both the groups as indicated in table -4 and figure -4.

5.2.3. Lexical category incomprehension
In inflectional suffixation, the mean score was 5 (2.5%), and in internal change and suppletion,
it was 20 and 5 with 10% and 2.5% in the elicited responses of group one. While group two formed
all lexical categories correctly. Moreover, they marked a highly significant difference between the
performances of lexical category comprehension among both the groups.
6. Discussion
6.1. Correct and incorrect forms
In this category, group two students produce correct forms of lexemes almost everywhere as
compared to group one students; they make errors in the words like 'permit', ‘divide’, ‘beauty’,
‘sit’, ‘ox’, ‘ goose’, ‘health’, ‘logical’, ‘balance’, ‘sing’, 'black' etc. Group one produces
sometimes either a word incorrectly or an incorrect lexical category in the word list as well as in
the sentences most of the times such as ‘song’, ‘permitted’, ‘perceived’, ‘beautiful’ for
‘sang/sung’, ‘permissible’, ‘perception’, ‘beautify’. Few times, this group supply incorrect
spelling like ‘oxed’, ‘oxes’ for ‘oxen’ and ‘divition’ for ‘division’. On the other hand, the latter
group make less frequent, developmental errors e.g., ‘permitted’ for ‘permissible’ and ‘blacked’
for ‘blacken’ as these could be considered right but in a different lexical category or in a different
place of occurrence. They use either the correct form mostly or just simply avoid to use it very less
often if they don’t know it, but group one students were not sure in their knowledge, thus, they
produce the incorrect forms very often in the word lists and sentences, for instance, ‘the girl has a
job and is not depending (dependent) on her family’, ‘she is not a depending (dependable) person’
and ‘my uncle saw two oxes (oxen) near his building.’ This shows that there is a significant
relationship between the correct use of words and the knowledge of morphological processes.
6.2.Overgeneralization
In the process of overgeneralization, group one students mostly overgeneralize suffixes. For
example, they were asked to form a noun from the word 'divide'. Instead of replacing ‘-de’ by ‘ion’, to make it a noun 'division' they write 'divition', because of a previous word 'produceproduction', the same is the case with other words like 'oxes' in place of 'oxen'. They overgeneralize
it with ‘chairs’ or ‘classes’, etc. On the other hand, group two students perform well except very
few suffixes like, 'black-blacked' instead of 'blacken'. In writing the sentences, the first group
carries overgeneralization e.g., ‘the man wears blacked jacket’, this gives absurd or vague
meaning. These learners are supposed to using ‘blacken’ as a verb, but they prefer the incorrect
adjective in place of a verb while the other group uses mostly the correct lexemes with the right
place of occurrence in the sentences. They overgeneralize very less in comparison to group one
because they are confident about the morphemic rules.
6.2. Avoidance
It is found that the least number of students in group one avoid word-formation. Without
possessing a proper knowledge of suffixes, they try to form a word correctly or incorrectly. Only
a few of them keep the space empty. In comparison, group two students outperform. It is observed
that avoid a word rarely whether in listing the words with different morphological processes or
using them in sentences. Because of this fact, they are aware enough in using those morphological
processes.

6.3.Lexical category incomprehension
Most of group one students show lack of knowledge in grammar as they could not change the
lexical category in class 1 derivational suffixation, for example, the formation of a word ‘permit’
into an adjective, has been changed into a noun or a verb by adding suffixes '-ion' or '-ed' to it as
'permission', 'permitted'. Similarly, in making a plural of word 'ox', 'oxed' is produced instead of
‘oxen’(they try to make it a verb). In the same way, 'perceives' in place of a noun 'perception' is
created, and so on. For instance, ‘I understand your perceives’. On the other hand, group two
marks comparatively far better understanding of lexical category. In inflectional morphology, the
first group students add ‘-s’ in ‘sit’ when they are instructed to apply the internal mutation,
however, the right answer is ‘sat’. The first group exhibits the incompetence in the production of
a new lexical category while group two learners are correct most of the times, and they supply
rarely any incorrect form like ‘seat’ in place of ‘sat’.
6.4.Morphophonemic unawareness
In this category, group one students in class 1 derivational suffixes appear to be unaware of
morphological rules except few. For instance, in the words 'produce', ‘perceive’, ‘divide’ and
‘permit’, they had to change it to an adjective and noun by adding suffixes ‘-ive' and ‘-ion', but are
seen frequently to create these words as 'produced', ‘producion’, ‘perceived’, ‘perceives’,
perceivtion’ ‘divided’,‘divition’ and ‘permitted’, ‘permition’. Class 1 derivation requires the
morphophonemic awareness to produce a new part of speech or to apply suffixation. Hence,
frequent errors are present in adding suffixes to class 1. According to the rule, they use suffix like
'-ion' correctly, but fail to change as per rule because of morphophonemic unawareness. Though,
group two students are rarely found to lag behind in morphophonology. In class 2 suffixation of
the derivational morphology, group one learners do well as it doesn’t demand any
morphophonemic rule. Here, their L2 exposure helps them formulate the words correctly. As in
irregular prefixes, the study of morphophonology is must, group one’s incompetence is relatively
very high, for example, they form ‘unlogical’, ‘unbalance’ in place of ‘illogical’, and ‘imbalance
(e.g., ‘it is unlogical (illogical)to follow’); however, the incorrect forms of ‘irregular’ and
‘incomplete’ are used less frequently. It might happen due to the fact that these words are very
common in spoken and written use. Group two learners exemplify that they know the
morphophonemic rules perfectly especially in prefixes. The findings indicate that there is a strong
and significant correlation between morphophonemic awareness and the correct use of words in
writing.
6.5.Semantic Change
The semantic change was seen while calculating the correct and incorrect use of words. It was
observed that it occurs due to the effect of morphological unawareness. Sometimes, group one
students, in class 1 derivational suffixes, demonstrate the change in the meaning of the lexemes
e.g., in the word 'black', they have to change it to verb by adding a suffix '-en', but they use a word
'block'. For example, ‘she blocked the bread in the toaster’. Contrastively, group two doesn’t show
such change.
To apply the morphological rules in the formation of words by both the groups, it has been
figured out from the elicited responses that group two, who studied the rules explicitly, forms

words more appropriately in comparison to group one, who didn’t study morphological rules or
this group had only implicit morphological knowledge. The difference between the affixation in
the writings of both the groups signifies clearly the importance of learning morphology. As the
focus of this paper is to demonstrate the differences in word formation among the students before
or after studying morphological rules, it has been observed from the results that the range of
vocabulary of group two students improves by learning morphology which in turn help them
understand grammar better, denote lexemes in a proper part of speech whereas group one is the
instance of poor results in the process of word formulation especially lexical category. Sometimes
the improper application of morphemic rules causes semantic change e.g., in the process of
suppletion, the word 'good' was changed to 'goodness' instead of 'better-best' in some students’
responses. Here, the change occurs not only in meaning but also from inflectional to derivational
morphology. It is also discovered that in inflectional morphology, group one makes much less
errors than derivational morphology because it requires learning the concrete grammatical,
morphophonemic structure. It must have occurred possibly due to FL exposure and the commonly
used words like ‘man-men’. The main reason behind the errors of group one is their morphemic
unawareness which leads to other errors such as grammatical, intralingual, lexical, etc. It clearly
focuses on the need for morphological knowledge. In order to avoid morphological errors in the
words or text of EFL students, it is better to teach them the rules which will make them competent
to reflect on the correct word-formation and further they can apply their knowledge in discourse:
written as well as spoken. This research finds that there is a highly significant correlation between
morphemic competence and the correct production of different words that affected EFL learners’
writing on a large basis. Morphological awareness doesn’t improve only the word formulation
process but it boosts orthographical, cognitive lexical, grammatical, intralingual, semantic,
syntactical accuracy, and proficiency of a language.
7. Conclusion
This study implies a promising contribution to language pedagogy, language learning, and
computational linguistics. As this study has tried to prove that if morphological processes will be
taught, errors will be less, so the writing of EFL students in terms of word formation can be
enhanced by teaching them morphological and morphophonemic rules and this puts emphasis on
teachers for giving some easy exercises of morphological rules while teaching skills (listening,
speaking, reading, writing and written structure) at the beginning level. They need to teach
different morphological processes step by step. First, language teachers may teach inflectional
suffixes. After that, they can move to the derivational affixes, the complex ones. Then they can go
ahead with other advanced morphological processes; therefore, learners may produce better and
effective writing, and later learning syntax would be easier for them. In this way, they can also
form different categories of words as nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives and so on. This research
suggests that explicit teaching must be introduced from early education and curricula may be
designed in such a way to raise morphological awareness among EFL learners. The teaching of
morphology could be incorporated with other courses and taught separately as a full course.
Though it is an empirical study to seek answers to many questions related to derivational and
inflectional morphology, it is limited to derivational and inflectional affixation and only two
morphological processes: internal change and suppletion. It is recommended that further work is
required in this arena e.g., compounding, other morphological processes: conversion,
