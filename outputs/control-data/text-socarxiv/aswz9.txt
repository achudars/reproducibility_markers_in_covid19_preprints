Abstract

The only prospect for the long-term survival of humankind is space
colonization: The establishment of permanent and self-sustaining human
habitats beyond Earth. One necessary condition for space colonization is
energy. In order to successfully colonize space, future generations will
have to have suitable sources of energy at their disposal. In this discussion
paper, existing as well as possible future energy sources are analyzed in
terms of their utility for space colonization. The conclusion is sobering:
Among existing energy sources, Solar power and nuclear fission are most
promising. However, without the (rapid) development of space-based Solar
power and nuclear fusion technologies, humankind might not be able to
sustain extraterrestrial habitats – humankind might go extinct if we do not
develop new sources of energy quickly enough. This existential energy
challenge is proposed as a novel and general explanation for the Fermi
paradox (the apparent absence of technologically advanced intelligence in
our galaxy other than humankind).

Introduction: Energy for what future?

We need stuff that gives us energy in order to do other stuff. In order to use our
phone, we need electricity. In order to drive a car, we need petroleum. In order to
light a campfire, we need wood. In order to live, we need food.
The fact that we use energy in order to achieve goals might seem a mundane,
almost trivial fact of life. But it is not trivial: Energy is intimately linked to
the progress of our civilization. On one hand, using energy is a consequence
of progress: The better we understand and take control of the world, the more
sources of and greater amounts of energy are at our disposal. On the other
hand, using energy is a driver of progress as well: The more energy we have at
our disposal, the better equipped we are to make life better and to further our
understanding of the world.
Given how important energy is to our civilization, it is only natural to wonder
what the medium- and long-term future of energy will look like. However, energy
is never an end in itself, but only of instrumental value. We do not want some
new energy source A for the mere sake of having energy source A at our disposal.
We want energy source A because using that energy source allows us to achieve
some goals that we could not achieve before, or that we could not achieve in quite
the same way before. The question of the future of energy is therefore always a
question of the goals energy is supposed to help us achieve. This fundamentally
instrumental nature of energy – the question of its purpose – can be broken down
into the following two questions:
1. What kind of future is desirable for humankind?
2. What kinds of energy sources can make that future more probable?
From an instrumental perspective, we first have to define the kind of future that
we deem desirable, and then, we can assess which energy sources can contribute
to making that future more probable. Of course, the specific kind of future we
should want for our civilization is not obvious or self-evident. There is literally an
infinite number of specific scenarios in which the future might play out, and there
are, accordingly, innumerable goals that we might potentially strive for in the
future. However, there is one specific baseline for the future of humankind that
most people probably see as desirable: We should want the future of humankind
to be one in which we humans actually still exist.
It might, at first glance, seem silly or whimsical to posit the future existence of
humankind as desirable because hardly anyone would object to this proposition.
So why even bring it up? Because the problem of existential risks means that such
an obviously desirable future might not come to be.

Existential risks, space colonization, and energy

Existential risks are risks that might lead to the extinction of humankind[1]. Natural existential risks (such as asteroids that might crash into Earth) are basically
constant. The risks of a giant asteroid crashing into Earth today is the same as
it was 500 years ago. Anthropogenic, man-made existential risks, on the other
hand, are growing in number and severity. They are a side-effect of technological
progress: The more we develop technologically, the greater man-made existential risks become. Nuclear weapons, to name only one example, are a direct
consequence of scientific and technological progress.
There are different approaches to existential risk mitigation. One approach is
to develop targeted strategies for specific existential risks. If we want to reduce
the existential risk posed by nuclear weapons, then we can and should develop
specific strategies for that risk.
Another approach is to develop and pursue what can be called meta-strategies
that target all existential risks at once. One of most effective meta-strategies for
tackling existential risks in general is space colonization: If we manage to establish
permanent and self-sustainable human habitats beyond Earth, then our proverbial
existential eggs are not all in one basket anymore. For example, if disaster strikes
on Earth, but there are billions of humans living on Venus and Mars, humankind
would continue to exist even with Earth-humans gone.
Because of existential risks, a long-term future in which humankind still exists
almost certainly has to be a future in which humankind has succeeded in colonizing space. Today, even though we regularly venture into space, we do not yet have
space colonization capabilities. There are a number of technological challenges
that we need to overcome in order to become capable of space colonization. One
of those challenges is energy. There are several reasons why.
First, if we establish permanent and self-sustaining habitats beyond Earth,
those habitats will have to power themselves somehow. Even if our goal is to
establish only one small colony on Mars that consists of no more than 10’000
people, that colony will have to have a reliable supply of energy at its disposal.
Second, habitats beyond Earth will almost certainly be less hospitable than
Earth in the early stages of space colonization. There is no planet or moon in
the vicinity of our Solar system that is as pleasant as Earth. For example, we can
easily survive a couple of days without electricity on Earth. In a colony on Mars,
on the other hand, a couple of days without electricity would almost certainly
mean swift and, for those affected, horrific death, because Mars is much colder
than Earth and contains no breathable air in its atmosphere. In other words: The
energy requirements for sustaining one human life are likely to be much greater
beyond Earth than they are on Earth.
Third, energy sources will also play a role for transit in space. Space coloniza6

tion means that (many) more humans than today will be voyaging through space.
In order to make long-term space voyage possible, we will need to have adequate
energy sources available on board, both for the purpose of life support as well as
for propulsion.

1.2

Criteria for colonization-conducive energy sources

If future energy sources are an important part of space colonization capabilities,
what kind of energy sources do we need? Obviously (and unfortunately), we do
not know with certainty today what energy sources might be available in the
future. But we can specify a set of criteria that future energy sources have to
meet as much as possible in order to help achieve the goal of space colonization.
There are at least five such criteria:
1. Portability. Future energy sources must be as portable as possible so that
they can be used in as many circumstances as possible. For example, a
hydroelectric power plant has very low portability. A spaceship could never
be powered by a hydroelectric power plant.
2. Availability. The energy sources have to be readily available, both in a
geographical and a temporal scope. If, for example, some new form of fuel
was very hard to obtain, then that fuel would represent a source of energy
with very low availability; almost no one could use it.
3. Sustainability. The energy sources should not be finite and easily depletable, but ideally abundantly available and practically unlimited (or
“renewable”). For example, crude oil is not sustainable, because its quantity
is limited to the steadily depleting reserves on Earth.
4. Energy Density. Per unit of mass, future energy sources should offer as
much energy as possible. For example, a kilogram of wood provides less
energy than a kilogram of crude oil. Technically speaking, this criterion is
not energy density but specific energy; energy density refers to energy per
unit of volume. I use the term “energy density” for the sake of simplicity.
In cases where energy density (or specific energy) is not really applicable
because to fuel in the traditional sense is used, we can approximate energy
density by looking at power density (e.g., wind), the energy output per unit
of surface area.
5. Acceptable levels of risk. Future sources of energy should create as few
and as small risks as possible.

Through the lens of these criteria, we can take a look at existing sources of
energy and at potential future sources of energy and assess whether and to what
degree they are “future-proof”. The better an energy source meets the five criteria
outlined above, the more “future proof” it is, in the sense of having high utility
for sustaining human habitats beyond Earth.

The future utility of existing energy sources

Over the course of the 20th century, humankind’s total energy consumption has
experienced a radical growth, thanks to increasing levels of global industrialization. That growth has come almost entirely in the form of fossil fuels [2]. Today,
fossil fuels are still the largest items on our energy menu by a large margin.

Our present energy sources have brought humankind to where we are today.
How much further can they take us?

2.1

Traditional biofuels

One of the major technological development of humankind was the ability to
control fire. Humans have been using fire probably for as long as there have been
humans [3], and the main biofuel that allowed us to use fire was wood.
8

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

Wood is the most important traditional biofuel, and it is still widely used today.
Other traditional biofuels include energy sources like charcoal, leaves, agricultural
residue, human and animal waste, and urban waste [4]. One major use for wood
is cooking, with the unfortunate consequence of significant smoke-related health
hazards [5]. But there are also relatively risk-free uses of wood, such as wood
pellets. Wood pellets are used for heating and for producing electricity, with few
environmental or other downsides [6].
Wood as an energy source can be essentially risk-free, and it can also be sustainable: Trees that are specifically grown on plantations to serve as a source of
energy do not contribute to deforestation and similar environmental problems.
However, wood has a very low energy density (around 16 Mega Joules per Kilogram), and it is not readily available (There are no trees growing on Mars, for
example.). Even though wood is portable in principle (we can cut wood into pieces
and move it around), creating wood is limited by atmospheric and environmental
factors. We cannot grow trees everywhere on Earth, let alone beyond Earth.
Even though wood is likely to continue being used on Earth in the foreseeable
future, it is almost inconceivable that wood (or any other traditional biofuel) will
play any kind of meaningful role in achieving space colonization.

2.2

Coal

The primary purpose of coal as a source of energy is generating electricity (but
coal itself also has other purposes, such as being an important component in the
production of steel [7] and cement [8]).
By definition, coal as a fossil fuel cannot be sustainable. Abundant though coal
is even today, at some point, coal reserves can be depleted. Coal is also a relatively
high-risk energy source, both because, as a large emission source CO2, it is a large
drive of climate change [9] and because the extraction of coal is a dangerous, all
too often deadly enterprise [10, 11]. Furthermore, coal is also not readily available
(Again, the Mars metaphor applies: There is no coal on Mars). Coal has about
twice the energy density of wood (around 30 Mega Joules), but the fact that it is not
sustainable probably make it even less future-proof than wood. Coal is portable
in principle (we can move coal around), but given its other disadvantages, that is
essentially irrelevant. For example, we will never transport coal from Earth to
Mars in order to generate electricity there.
Under any reasonable set of assumptions, coal will not contribute in any way
to achieving space colonization.

2.3

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

Crude oil

Crude oil is perhaps the most “famous” fossil fuel. Crude oil is omnipresent in
our daily lives. We use products derived from crude oil all the time, such as
various petrochemicals (For example, plastics). But crude oil is also an immensely
important energy source: The vast majority of internal combustion engines use
fuel that is refined from crude oil.
Crude oil has much the same problems as coal: It is not sustainable (at some
point in the not-too-distant future, we might run out of oil [12]), we are likely to
reach peak oil), and it is not readily available (Or, in terms of the Mars metaphor:
We can drill for oil for Mars all we want, but there will be none). As a fossil fuel,
crude oil is also contributing to climate change, making it a risky energy source.
Fuels refined from crude oil are slightly more energy dense than coal (around 45
Mega Joules), but that still represents a low energy density (We use fossil fuels
because of their current relative abundance, not because of their energy density).
Crude oil is portable in principle (we move it around in barrels today).
Overall, crude oil will play no role in achieving space colonization.

2.4

Natural gas

Natural gas is the third part of the fossil fuel trifecta. Natural gas is mainly used
for creating heat (heating buildings and cooking) and for generating electricity.
Natural gas has a higher energy density than coal and crude oil (at around 55 Mega
Joules), but it has the same disadvantages as coal and crude oil. Just as is the case
with coal and crude oil, natural gas is not sustainable (there is a finite amount
of it), it is not readily available (Once again: There are no natural gas reserves
on Mars), and it is a risky energy source (Besides exacerbating climate change,
extraction techniques such as fracking also have more immediate negative health
and environmental effects [13].). Just as coal and crude oil, natural gas is portable
in principle; we move it around.
Overall, natural gas has the same major shortcomings as coal and crude oil,
and accordingly, it will not contribute to achieving space colonization.

2.5

Hydropower

Hydropower is an energy source that uses water flow (or gravitational potential
energy) in order to produce mechanical energy or electricity. Hydropower is not
a new source of energy. We have, for example, been using watermills for several
thousand years. Modern hydropower is mainly focused on electricity production
by building dams or pumped-storage facilities. In recent years, hydropower has
become more popular [14], not least thanks to its climate-friendly appeal and
10

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

the tried-and-true nature of the technology. Even though large hydroelectric
projects can create some environmental and social risks [15] and even though the
costs of hydroelectric projects could be higher than conventionally projected [16],
hydropower is generally a low-risk energy source. Hydropower is also sustainable
(under the assumption that water flows do not substantially change over time)
and, even though hydropower has no energy density per se (water is not directly
used as a fuel), it can provide substantial amounts of energy. For example, almost
60% of all electricity generated in Switzerland is generated with hydroelectric
power plants [17].
Unfortunately, hydropower has two major downsides: It is not readily available
and it is not portable. In order to use hydropower, we need large and mobile water
masses (Or masses of other liquids.). This condition is not even met everywhere
on Earth. Hydropower is also not portable in any meaningful way. A space ship,
for example, will never use hydropower for generating electricity.
These two major limitations mean that hydropower will probably only play
a minor role, if any, in making space colonization a reality. The engineering
principles behind hydropower are universal and it is conceivable that humans
could build hydroelectric power plants on planets and moons that have masses
of liquids (not necessarily water). But at such a point in the future, hydropower
will be more of a “nice to have”. For example, hydropower does not seem like an
energy source that will allow us to establish permanent habitats on Mars. Instead,
a colonized and massively terraformed Mars could allow for the installation of
hydropower plants – but if we are able to successfully colonize and terraform
Mars, we almost certainly have no need for hydropower.

2.6

Nuclear fission

Nuclear fission is the energy source used in current nuclear power plants. The
process is called fission because uranium (or plutonium) atoms are being split
into lighter elements and neutrons. This splitting process releases energy that
can be harvested by transforming it into other forms of energy.
The biggest difference between nuclear fission and other existing energy
sources is energy density. Even though fission does not have a single fixed energy
density (reactor types and fission material play a role), nuclear fission will typically
yield around 14’000 times as much energy per kg of fission material as a kg of
crude oil [18]. Nuclear fission allows us to account orders of magnitude more
energy per mass unit than other existing energy sources, even accounting for
the energy required to transform suitable fission material into fuel (For example,
uranium typically has to be mined and enriched before it can be used in fission.).
The risk of nuclear fission is a contentious issue. On one hand, nuclear
fission has essentially the best safety track record of all energy sources that
11

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

are currently in use [19]. On the other hand, adverse events in nuclear fission
reactors, rare though they are, can have great negative consequences – so great,
in fact, that operators of nuclear fission plants are only liable for damages up
to a certain monetary level [20]. The risk of nuclear fission plants is so great
that a regular insurance market does not exist for them. This is a situation
unique to nuclear fission. In addition, a second risk factor of nuclear fission is
the problem of nuclear waste. Currently, we do not have perfectly safe ways
for dealing with nuclear waste material that remains radioactive for thousands
of years. Currently, the main strategy is to store nuclear waste away deep into
the underground in places that will, hopefully, experience little tectonic activity
either for thousands of years or, at the very least, until we develop the technical
means to safely and permanently dispose of nuclear waste. One such technical
solution is already on the horizon: Molten salt reactor designs that are able to
use nuclear waste material as fission fuel [21]. This type of fission reactor design
has the additional benefits of effectively eliminating the risk of an uncontrolled,
catastrophic runaway meltdown chain reaction, and of producing less as well as
shorter-lived nuclear waste [22].
Nuclear fission is portable in principle, since fission material that is used as
well as the reactors that are needed can be freely transported. Nuclear fission
(or, more precisely: fuel for nuclear fission) is readily available in principle. The
elements that are suitable for current fission reactors (uranium, plutonium, and
thorium) are being mined on Earth, and they are also available beyond Earth.
Nuclear fission is also sustainable in practical terms, because there is plenty of
fission material in our Solar system and in the galaxy, and because some reactor
types, so-called breeder reactors, can actually produce more fission fuel than they
consume [23].
The properties of nuclear fission make it a potentially important energy source
for establishing self-sustaining human habitats beyond Earth. It is portable,
sustainable, and common fission materials are both readily available as well
as highly energy dense. However, nuclear fission has a risk that is difficult to
quantify. Even though its safety record is, overall, very good, potential adverse
events are so great that normal risk mitigation through insurance does not work.
In addition (or consequently), nuclear fission is a controversial energy source in
the eye of the public, and public opinion on nuclear fission tends to be volatile.
Singular accidents can have a long-lasting negative impact on the acceptance
of nuclear fission [24], meaning that long-term planning with nuclear fission
can be difficult – plans drawn up today might lose support tomorrow. So even
though nuclear fission could be an indispensable sine qua non energy source
for making space colonization possible, limited and volatile public acceptance of
nuclear fission could mean that colonization attempts that involve nuclear fission
might be difficult to realize on political grounds.

Wind power

Wind power is a fairly old energy source. For thousands of years, humans have
been using wind to propel boats and ships, and for at least a thousand years,
humans have been using windmills and wind-powered water pumps. In recent
decades, wind power has become increasingly attractive for generating electricity
through wind turbines.
Modern wind power has one major benefit: It is sustainable. As long as there
is an atmosphere on Earth, there will be wind, because wind results from uneven
heating of our atmosphere by the sun. Wind power is also a relatively low-risk
energy source. Perhaps the main risk of wind power is that large-scale land-based
wind farms could slightly increase local and regional surface temperatures [25].
That risk, however, is relatively small, because such a worst-case scenario assumes
that the majority of a large land area (such as a continent) would be covered by
wind turbines – a scenario that will almost certainly never become reality.
Wind power does have some downsides, however. Even though wind does
not have energy density per se (similar to hydropower), the output per unit of
area (sometimes referred to as power density) of wind turbines is relatively small.
For example, if the United States were to generate all of the energy it uses with
existing wind turbine technology, over 70% of the United States would have to be
covered in wind farms [26].
Wind power is also not readily available. On Earth, wind is omnipresent (from
a global perspective). Beyond Earth, however, wind is a rarity. Wind only exists
where some kind of atmosphere exists, so wind power is limited to planets and
moons that have suitable atmospheres. In consequence, wind power only has
limited portability. We can install wind turbines anywhere, but if there is no
wind blowing, no electricity can be generated. The problems of availability and
portability of wind power are an issue even on Earth today. There are great efforts
underway to make wind energy more easily storable so that it is more readily
available and more portable [27].
Even though wind is an attractive source of renewable energy on Earth, wind
power is unlikely to play a meaningful role in achieving space colonization.

2.8

Solar power

The most important energy source on Earth is the Sun: Without the Sun, there
would be no life on Earth. For the longest part of the history of humankind, we
have used Solar power more or less passively. For example, the vast majority
of agricultural plant cultivation relies on the Sun to provide energy that is then
transformed into chemical forms of energy in the plants.
In recent decades, however, we have begun to additionally harness Solar
13

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

energy more directly. Through various technological advances, it has become
possible to convert solar power to heat or to electricity. The conversion of Solar
power to electricity with the help of photovoltaic cells is at the heart of the current
interest in Solar power. Even though photovoltaic cells have first been developed
in the 1950s [28], Solar power has grown into a meaningful energy source only
in the 2000s, thanks both to greater efficiencies of photovoltaic cells and lower
production costs [29].
The two biggest advantages of Solar power are its sustainability and its availability. For practical purposes, Solar energy can be considered an unlimited source
of energy on Earth and, more generally, in our Solar system (A few billion years
into the future, the Sun will begin a process of catastrophic decay, so Solar energy
is technically not unlimited and everlasting.). Solar power is not only sustainable,
but it is also readily available: Earth is constantly bathed in Solar power (Or,
more precisely: About one half of Earth is constantly illuminated by the Sun). In
addition, solar power is also essentially risk-free.
The energy density (in the sense of power density) of Solar power is better
than that of wind power [26]. In order to generate some amount of electricity,
Solar panels require around 10 times less surface area than wind turbines.
The main downside of Solar power is portability. Solar power technology
itself is portable, but energy created through Solar panels is not being created
at a constant pace, but in fluctuations and bursts. One of the reasons for the
intermittent nature of Solar power is, of course, the daily cycle of daytime and
nighttime. In recent years, however, there have been significant improvements in
storage technologies for Solar power. Energy created through Solar panels can be
converted and stored in what amounts to large batteries, be they thermal [30] or
chemical [31] in nature.
Overall, the properties of Solar power make it an energy source that could be
conducive to space colonization. However, it is unclear what kind of role Solar
power might play. Given the abundance of Solar energy in our Solar system, it is
possible that Solar power could be a primary energy source that will drive space
colonization. Alternatively, Solar power could also become a useful secondary,
complementary energy source that is not sufficient on its own for establishing
and sustaining habitats beyond Earth. One reason why the second scenario might
be more likely is the simple fact that the potential for Solar power diminishes the
further away we are from the Sun. If we were to venture into interstellar space by
leaving our Solar system, for example, Solar power would be useless. However,
given the fact that the initial stage of human expansion beyond Earth will have
to take place in our Solar system, humans will remain close to the Sun for some
time to come.

Geothermal energy

Heat on the surface of Earth is mostly coming from above; from the Sun. However,
the surface of the Earth is also constantly being heated from below: Due to
decaying radioactive isotopes as well as the remains of the primordial heat (heat
that was generated during the formation of the Earth), the inside of the Earth is
hot. Very hot, in fact: Earth’s inner core is about as hot as the surface of the sun,
at around 5’500°C to 6’000°C.
Earth’s internal heat has been used as a source of energy for thousands of
years. For example, hot springs have a long tradition of being used for cooking,
bathing, and house heating around the world [32]. In more recent times, technological advances have made it possible make greater use of geothermal energy
for heating and generating electricity. Today, over 20 countries create electricity
from geothermal energy, and in over 40 additional countries, geothermal energy
is being used for heating (and cooling) purposes [33]. Modern use of geothermal energy is relatively young; electricity generation through geothermal power
plants began only in the 1990-ies.
The biggest benefit of geothermal energy is its sustainability: For all practical
purposes, geothermal energy is an inexhaustible source of energy (It will take
many millions of years before the inside of the Earth cools down.). Geothermal
energy does not really have energy density, but its power density (the surface area
necessary to produce a unit of energy) is comparable to that of wind energy [34].
Geothermal energy is not risk-free. Perhaps the most prominent downside
of installing and operating geothermal reactors is a noticeable increase in small
earthquakes [35]. Even though earthquakes created by geothermal energy are
low in magnitude, they can lower the quality of life and damage infrastructure
in populated areas. Geothermal energy can also have negative environmental
consequences, such as air and water pollution [36].
The major downsides of geothermal energy is that it is neither portable nor
is it readily available. On Earth, we can essentially install geothermal reactors
anywhere, but beyond Earth, geothermal energy is obviously limited to planets
and moons that have naturally occurring geothermal activity. Geothermal energy
can be harnessed beyond Earth in principle (for example, on Mars [37]), but its
availability is very limited.

Modern biofuels

All biofuels are “modern” insofar as they are the product of recent biological
processes. For example, when we burn wood, that wood has come into existence
in the relatively recent past. However, there are some biofuels that have only
relatively recently been discovered or developed as such; they can be labeled
15

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

“modern” in the sense of being relatively young technologies (or the product
thereof). The family of biofuels that are modern in the technological sense
contains energy sources such as biomass-based biodiesel and bioethanol [38] or
fuels based on lipids produced by algae [39].
Modern biofuels are mostly supplements to or replacements for fossil fuels,
primarily oil. They are, therefore, very similar to fossil fuels in terms of energy
density and in terms of portability. Some of their other properties, however, make
them more attractive than fossil fuels.
Modern biofuels are, in contrast to fossil fuels, sustainable in principle. Whereas
there is a finite amount of fossil fuels that can eventually be depleted, modern
biofuels are constantly being created. Modern biofuels are also more available
than fossil fuels: Whereas fossil fuels are available only in some areas of Earth,
modern biofuels can be created anywhere. Finally, modern biofuels are also less
risky than fossil fuels. Modern biofuels do not contribute to climate risks, because
any greenhouse gases they release have only recently been captured, so there is
no net increase in greenhouse gases.
Modern biofuels are more attractive than fossil fuels, but it does not necessarily follow from those relative benefits that modern biofuels will play a meaningful
role in contributing to space colonization. Modern biofuels are based on converting one form of energy into other; mostly, light energy is converted through
photosynthesis. In order to generate meaningful amounts of biofuels, resources
such as land area and fertilizers are required. The resource requirements are so
great that is is uncertain whether biofuels could ever replace current fossil fuel
use on Earth [40]. In order for modern biofuels to be a viable future energy source
beyond Earth, vast terrestrial and extra-terrestrial biofuel farms would have to be
established. That does not seem like a realistic scenario.
There is, however, a possible special case of modern biofuels that might have a
greater benefit in our space colonization endeavors: Algae that produce hydrogen
rather than lipids [41]. Hydrogen has over three times the energy density of crude
oil, and it is a common propellant in current rocket propulsion systems.

Summary: Existing energy sources

Table 1 contains a summary of the properties of existing energy sources as discussed in the subsections above.
As can be seen in the table, two energy sources stand out: Solar energy
and nuclear fission. Among the major energy sources that humankind is using
today, Solar energy and nuclear fission have the highest potential to contribute
to achieving space colonization capabilities. The major drawback of Solar energy
is that it requires relative proximity to a star, but in the initial stages of space
colonization, humankind will stay close to a star, our Sun. The major drawback

of fission energy is the fuzzy nature of its risk. Nuclear fission has the best safety
record of all energy sources, but the low probability, high damage nature of its risk
means that conventional modes of risk management (such as insurance schemes)
are only of limited use. However, more modern fission reactor designs could
greatly change the risk profile of nuclear fission by effectively eliminating the
possibility of a runaway meltdown chain reaction.

3

Potential future energy sources

The future is uncertain and it is, to some degree, stochastic. This means that we
cannot predict with great confidence what energy sources we might be able to
tap into in the future. However, we can assess how attractive potential energy
sources are for achieving space colonization capabilities, and we can produce
rough estimates for how likely it is that we will be able to use these potential
energy sources in a not-too-distant future.

3.1

Nuclear fusion

In two ways, nuclear fusion is perhaps the oldest future energy source. First,
nuclear fusion is the energy source that makes life on Earth possible: Our Sun is,
in principle, a giant fusion reactor, because the Sun creates the energy it sends
into space by constantly fusing hydrogen atoms into helium.
Second, the idea of harnessing the power of nuclear fusion on Earth is also
a relatively old idea. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been
research into fusion reactor designs that would make it possible to use nuclear
17

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

fusion in a stable and efficient manner [42]. Since the early 2000s, research and
development of nuclear fusion power plants has intensified, as evidenced both
by government-sponsored projects such as the enormous ITER project in France
[43] as well as privately owned and funded fusion reactor companies [44]. Even
though nuclear fusion can be achieved today in experimental fusion reactors, we
are currently neither able to make fusion a net-positive source of energy (it takes
more power to trigger fusion in a fusion reactor than can be harnessed) nor to
make it a stable and reliable source of energy (fusion reactions last a few seconds
at most).
Nuclear fusion is desirable for several reasons. Fusion reactions have very high
energy density. The most feasible fusion materials today are deuterium and tritium,
both isotopes of hydrogen. Even though a singular fusion reaction releases less
energy than a singular fission reaction using, say, uranium, the energy density
of fusion fuel is much greater per mass unit than fission. Using one kilogram of
deuterium and tritium yields up to ten times more energy than using one kilogram
of uranium [45, 46].
Nuclear fusion is a relatively low risk source of energy, not least compared
to nuclear fission [47]. There is no risk of an uncontrollable runaway chain
reaction in the case of an accident or emergency. If there is a failure in a fusion
reactor, the fusion process will simply stop. Furthermore, fusion reactors will
produce very little and short-lived nuclear waste materials. Tritium, one of the
fuels used for fusion, is mildly radioactive and has a short half-life of around 12
years. Furthermore, tritium does not need to be transported to fusion reactors
since it can be generated on-site in the reactor from small quantities of lithium.
Nuclear fusion has high availability, sustainability, and portability. Nuclear
fusion is not limited to Earth, but it can, given our current technological prospects,
take place anywhere where deuterium and lithium are available or can be generated. Nuclear fusion is also sustainable for practical purposes because fusion
materials are de facto inexhaustible on practically relevant time scales and use
cases. Nuclear fusion is also highly portable since the technology of prospective
fusion reactors is not Earth-bound.
Nuclear fusion is a highly desirable energy source that could greatly improve
humankind’s prospects for successfully establishing colonies beyond Earth. As an
added benefit, fusion reactors could also be the basis for fusion-based propulsion
in future spacecraft [48]. Nuclear fusion could therefore contribute to space
colonization in two ways: By allowing us to harness great amounts of energy, and
by allowing us to travel through space faster and more efficiently. Unfortunately,
there is no reliable estimate for when (or even if) we will be able to deploy nuclear
fusion reactors. The ITER experimental reactor in France will begin operations
in 2025, and the current wave of research and investment into fusion reactors is
unlikely to suddenly subside. However, nuclear fusion has famously been just
18

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

around the corner for decades; any prediction about when nuclear fusion will
become viable are highly uncertain at best, overconfident at worst.

3.2

Space-based Solar power

Solar power is among the most promising existing energy sources, as outlined
in subsection 2.8. The potential of Solar power, however, is not exhausted with
Solar panels deployed directly in human habitats (such as, currently, on Earth):
In principle, Solar power can also be harnessed from space.
Space-based Solar power would offer the same benefits as Solar power in
general, and on top of those benefits, greater economies of scale and greater
overall flexibility would be added. For example, we might not deem it practically
or aesthetically desirable to cover large portions of the surface of human habitats
(Earth, for example) in Solar panels. Placing an equivalent amount of Solar panel
in space, on the other hand, might be much less of a contentious issue. Also,
given sufficient technological and engineering prowess, the total amount of Solar
panels that could be deployed in space is orders of magnitude greater than the
amount of Solar panels that could, realistically, be deployed on the surface of
human habitats. In principle, it is even possible to devise massive arrays of Solar
panels that could encircle the Sun and thus generate massive amounts of energy,
as was famously described with the concept of the Dyson sphere [49].
One current major limitation of space-based Solar power is the question of
how the energy that is harnessed in space could best be transferred to the locations
where we actually need the energy. One potential way to solve this problem is to
transmit power wirelessly, for example by converting the energy into microwave
radiation or laser emissions [50, 51]. Research into space-based Solar power is
ongoing and practical experiments are likely to grow in number in the coming
years. However, it is doubtful whether the technology will mature enough to
actually provide meaningful amounts of energy within the next two to three
decades. In the second half of the 21st century, however, space-based Solar power
might have become practically viable and scalable.

3.3

Antimatter

Antimatter is matter that has the opposite properties of matter. All subatomic
particles have nearly identical “twins” that differ only in the direction of their
charge. For example, the antimatter counterpart of a negatively charged electron
is a positively charged positron. Antimatter is not the stuff of theoretical physics
and science fiction; antimatter can be observed and even created with today’s
technology.

19

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

From the point of view of an energy-consuming civilization, antimatter is an
intriguing potential energy source. When matter and antimatter collide, enormous
amounts of energy are released. The energy released by this kind of “annihilation”
reaction is orders of magnitude greater than that released by nuclear fission
or fusion. The hypothetical energy density of matter-antimatter annihilation is
immense; so much so that matter-antimatter annihilation represents one of the
most potent potential energy sources given our current understanding of physics.
Antimatter is also potentially highly available, sustainable, and portable. Antimatter exists everywhere in the universe and it can also be created artificially (in
particle accelerators, for example). There is no limit when, where, and how much
antimatter can be used in hypothetical matter-antimatter reactors.
The risk of matter-antimatter annihilation is difficult to estimate because we
are nowhere near any viable experimental reactor setups. The risk might not
be negligible, however, simply because of the large quantities of energy that are
being released. If large quantities of antimatter were to be released due to a failure
in the reactor, the resulting explosive release of energy might be devastating. But
such a speculative worst-case scenario has no basis in theoretical or experimental
research – there simply are no designs for matter-antimatter annihilation reactors,
and it is not clear how large potential worst-case adverse events would be.
The main challenge of antimatter as an energy source might not be the task
of designing and building matter-antimatter annihilation reactors, but actually
acquiring sufficient amounts of antimatter to use in such a reactor [52]. Currently,
we are unable to produce meaningful quantities of antiparticles, and we are unable
to collect naturally occurring antimatter.

3.4

Black holes

Black holes are regions of space and time that have such enormous gravity that
nothing can escape them; not even light.
However, the physicist Stephen Hawking famously proposed that, even though
nothing that enters a black hole can escape it, black holes do emit a form of
radiation that is today known as Hawking radiation [53]. One implication of
Hawking radiation is that black holes are not necessarily eternal, but that they
effectively “evaporate” over long periods of time (unless they can absorb enough
mass to compensate for the energy and mass lost in the form of Hawking radiation).
The fact that black holes evaporate means that, in principle, the radiation they are
dissipating can be harvested and used for other purposes. “Mining” energy from
black holes in this manner has first been suggested in the 1980s [54]. Unfortunately,
the properties of space-time are so peculiar near the event horizon of black holes
(the figurative point of no return) that harvesting radiation emitted by black holes
is fundamentally difficult in practical terms. Mining black holes seems not be just
20

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

a regular engineering problem and it is unclear whether black holes could ever
be meaningfully mined for energy [55].
There is a second way in which black holes could be used for producing energy.
Many, perhaps even most black holes are spinning very fast because they were
created by an imploding star that was spinning at the time of its implosion. This
spinning motion distorts a region of space around the black hole, the so-called
ergosphere. The spinning ergosphere contains immense amounts of rotational
energy that we can, in principle, tap into. A very effective way of doing so is to
direct electromagnetic radiation at the ergosphere. Electromagnetic radiation is
already traveling at the speed of light in space (so it cannot increase its speed any
more), but the rotational energy of the ergosphere can amplify the radiation that
passes through it. If we were to shoot some amount of radiation at the ergosphere,
a part of the radiation would end up being swallowed by the black hole, and
another part would escape the ergosphere with “stronger” than before; it would
be amplified.
This amplification process can be repeated multiple times by bouncing the
amplified radiation back into the ergosphere with mirrors. If we were to go
one step further and completely envelop a black hole in mirrors, the resulting
amplification of the radiation shot at the ergosphere would be immense, thanks to
so-called superradiant scattering [56]. Superradiant scattering essentially means
that mirrors built around a black hole would bounce around radiation for as long
as we want it to, and that process of bouncing around the radiation would result
in great net gains in power.
In summary, black holes as energy sources are potentially highly available
and sustainable. They can also be portable, because it is possible to create artificial
miniature black holes (Although such artificial black holes would probably not be
spinning but stationary.). Black holes do not have an energy density per se, and
the amount of energy we could harness from them is dependent on the size of
the black holes and on the technique used for generating energy. Amplifying
electromagnetic radiation by bouncing it around in a spinning black hole’s ergosphere would create more energy than mining a black hole’s Hawking radiation.
However, the ergosphere amplification method would require us to travel to
suitable black holes that already exist, whereas we could, in principle, artificially
create miniature black holes that are suitable for mining. The risks of black holes
as energy sources are not trivial. For example, artificial black holes created in the
vicinity of Earth could potentially swallow up the Earth if we failed to contain it
at a safe distance.
Even though black holes could be a potentially highly attractive source of
energy, there is no clear technological path towards tapping into that energy. In
practical terms, black hole energy is currently entirely speculative. That might
change if we were to develop the means to reliably create and control miniature
21

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

black holes, but developing such technology is a large challenge in and of itself.

3.5

Summary: Potential future energy sources

Speculating about energy sources that might become viable in the future is an
inherently uncertain undertaking, and the analysis presented above is accordingly
preliminary and incomplete. Of the four potential future energy sources discussed
above, space-based solar power seems to be the most feasible. In principle, spacebased Solar power is just the deployment of existing technology in space, with
the added challenge of transporting the energy that is being generated back to
Earth (or other human habitats). Of course, doing so is no trivial engineering feat,
but there is a clear path towards space-based Solar power.
Another future energy source that is seemingly within humankind’s grasp
is nuclear fusion. The attractiveness of nuclear fusion is obvious: If humankind
were to master nuclear fusion in the near future, a large part of humankind’s
future energy needs would be met. However, even though the core principles of
fusion energy are well understood, creating a practically viable fusion reactor
remains elusive, and it is uncertain whether there is a realistic path towards fusion
energy.
Antimatter reactors are, in principle, more attractive than fusion reactors, and
serendipitous scientific discoveries might result in leapfrogging nuclear fusion in
favor of antimatter reactors. However, almost every aspect of antimatter reactors
is purely theoretical and speculative in nature; there are no real-world efforts for
actually developing antimatter reactors.
Black holes as energy sources are similarly speculative; if anything, the actual
technology required for harnessing energy from natural or artificial black holes
is even further away than antimatter reactors.

Conclusion: What will fuel humankind’s survival?

In order to survive in the long-term, humankind has to spread beyond Earth. In
order to successfully do that, we need energy sources that satisfy a set of criteria
(energy density, availability, portability, sustainability, and acceptable levels of
risk) as much as possible.
Among the energy sources that currently exist, Solar power and nuclear
fission satisfy these criteria the most. However, in order to make successful space
colonization more probable, humankind will also need additional energy sources.
Some promising candidates are space-based Solar power and nuclear fusion, but
the practical viability of the latter is still questionable.
22

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

This conclusion has at least two important (and potentially worrisome) implications.

4.1

Nuclear fusion or bust?

The permanent human expansion beyond Earth will require large amounts of
energy: Sustaining one human life in an extra-terrestrial habitat will almost
certainly require (potentially a lot) more energy than sustaining one human life
on Earth.
Given our current technological capabilities, three energy sources are very
likely to be available in the future: Solar power, nuclear fission, and space-based
Solar power. However, it is unclear whether these energy sources will be sufficient
to power early-stage space colonization. Unless we develop a set of life-sustaining
technologies that are much more energy efficient than the technology and technological trajectories of today, space colonization might require more energy than
can be generated via (space-based) Solar power and nuclear fission. In order to
satisfy the energy needs of early-stage space colonization, humankind might need
another energy source. The most likely candidate is nuclear fusion: If we master
fusion reactors, humankind will be able to generate practically inexhaustible and
large amounts of energy, on Earth and beyond. But is nuclear fusion a conditio sine
qua non of space colonization; a necessary condition for humankind to expand
beyond Earth?
In order to answer this question, we can engage in a counterfactual thought
experiment. Given that the theoretical principles and cornerstones of fusion energy and fusion reactors are fairly well understood, let us assume that humankind
should have mastered nuclear fusion by the year 2100. Now, we enter a relativistic
time machine and travel into the year 2100 – and we see that humankind does not
use fusions reactors at all. Why could that be? There are three potential reasons.
1. First, humankind might leapfrog fusion energy in favor of some other,
more attractive energy source. For example, antimatter reactors might
serendipitously become viable, thus eliminating the need for fusion energy.
2. Second, fusion energy might become technologically viable but politically
untenable. The public view of nuclear energy might drastically deteriorate
in the future, resulting in a de facto or de iure ban of nuclear technology.
3. Third, fusion energy might turn out to be a fundamentally “hard” problem
to solve, with no practically viable solution by the year 2100.
The only desirable scenario is the first one: Hopefully, fusion energy will
become obsolete before humankind has to rely on it in order to survive.
23

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

Scenario two is unlikely. Even though public opinion on nuclear energy
is volatile, the fundamental safety benefits of fusion reactors vis-à-vis fission
reactors can be conveyed to and understood by the general public. Additionally,
it is unrealistic that any body politic would willingly opt for extinction when
faced with the choice between clean and practically limitless fusion energy versus
extinction.
The third scenario is the most worrisome. If fusion energy indeed proves to
be a fundamentally “hard” problem to solve, the expansion of humankind beyond
Earth and therefore the survival of humankind could be in peril. However, the
failure to tame nuclear fusion does not deterministically mean that humankind
will fail to colonize space, even in the absence of energy sources more attractive
than nuclear fusion. First, incremental improvements in (space-based) Solar power
and nuclear fission technologies could mean that, over the decades, these two
technologies could scale up to the levels required for early-stage colonization.
Second, it is not impossible that technological progress in other domains will
result in a set of, generally speaking, life-supporting technologies that are much
more energy efficient than their counterparts today.

4.2

Energy as the great filter: A solution for the Fermi paradox?

As far as we know, life is nothing particularly special. We do not know with high
confidence how exactly life on Earth started, but it is generally accepted that life
can arise from lifeless matter [57]. Given this general premise, there is no reason
to believe that biological life is a once-in-a-universe event that only took place on
Earth. On the contrary: If there does not seem to be anything exceedingly special
about the origin of life, then we can expect life to have developed in many places
in our galaxy and beyond. If we assume that simple biological life is not rare in
the universe, then we can also assume that some of the time, simple life forms
evolve into more complex and more intelligent life forms, such as us humans. The
existence of complex intelligent life should, at least some of the time, coincide
with the existence of technologically advanced civilizations. In other words: It is
possible that we are “not alone” in the universe.
The proposition that technologically advanced biological civilizations other
than humankind might exist is entirely plausible. But if we accept this proposition,
we need to ask ourselves an important question: Where are they?
If technologically advanced civilizations should, on probabilistic grounds,
arise often even in our own galaxy, let alone in the whole universe, it is surprising
that there seems to be no sign of any civilization. There is not the slightest bit of
evidence that extraterrestrial biological intelligence exists. This is surprising not
24

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

least because any civilization is driven by the imperative of space colonization
– in order to survive, any and all civilizations must expand beyond their home
world. Yet we seem to be alone.
This contradiction between theory and observation is the famous Fermi paradox, named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi who described the problem.
Over the decades, the Fermi paradox has been the subject of much speculation
and inquiry, and there are many possible explanations for the Fermi paradox
[58]. One set of explanations or “solutions” for the Fermi paradox relies on the
so-called great filter argument [59]. The great filter argument posits that there
might be one or several stages in the evolutionary development of technologically
advanced civilizations that are not quite as easy to reach as we might expect. The
great filter might exist at early stages of the metaphorical journey: Life might
not come into existence as often as we might believe, after all. This particular
variant of the great filter hypothesis is sometimes described as the “rare Earth”
hypothesis [60].
The great filter may also lie further ahead in the evolutionary trajectory of life.
Life might indeed be very common in the universe, but technologically advanced
civilizations might routinely fail to colonize space. A common reason for why this
might be is presented in the introductory sections above: Existential risks. Natural
as well as technologically induced existential risks mean that any civilization is
bound to go extinct in the long run if it fails to permanently spread beyond its
homeworld.
How does this great filter argument relate to the energy outlook outlined in
this discussion paper? One specific reason for why technologically advanced
civilizations might fail to colonize space and therefore succumb to existential
risks is the lack of adequate energy sources. The particular constellation that
humankind finds itself in today with regards to energy sources could follow a
universal pattern: Rapid technological progress induced by a scientific revolution
creates many new existential risks, and those existential risks ultimately outpace
a civilization’s capability for mastering colonization-conducive energy sources.
In other words: Mastering energy sources that make space colonization possible
could be a fundamentally “hard problem” that most civilizations fail to solve
quickly enough, resulting in their extinction.

Policy outlook

The future of energy is a difficult problem from a policy perspective. Obviously,
we can be reasonably confident that no one in any kind of policy-making position
wants to reduce the long-term survival prospects of humankind. However, the
link between energy, space colonization, and the long-term survival of humankind
25

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

in a policy context is novel and abstract (at least compared to more “down to
earth”, mundane policy problems). This presents us with several policy-related
challenges.

5.1

Setting the policy agenda

Energy policy is a major policy area. Energy plays an important role on every policy level (local, regional, national, international), and it is probably only
growing in importance in light of the challenge that is climate change. However,
framing the question of the future of energy supply as a long-term view of space
colonization and the survival of humankind is, at the very least, uncommon (It is
probably more realistic to assume that no policy-making body on Earth currently
applies this analytic framework.). One basic challenge is therefore to promote
this view of the future of energy in policy-making circles. Unfortunately, that is
easier said than done.
The long-term future is notoriously difficult to advocate for in the realm of
policy and politics. From a rational point of view, there are simply no special
interest groups or lobby groups that advocate for the long-term future – if there
is no one to voice grievances or demands, the policy agenda is unlikely to change.
From an irrational point of view, policy-makers suffer from the same “present bias”
[61] that everybody else suffers from: We all tend to heavily and disproportionately
discount the future utility of positive outcomes or rewards. Even though the
long-term future is enormously important, we don’t really care about it all that
much.
Bringing the long-term, space colonization frame of energy supply onto the
policy agenda is a considerable challenge. Policy-makers have little, if anything
to gain (in terms of re-election prospects, for example), and there is no lobby
with the resources traditionally required for changing the policy agenda. Add
to that the fact that any issue related to the long-term future has the automatic
connotation of being a “cerebral” or “theoretical” problem rather than something
that matters there and now. In this discussion paper, I offer no concrete strategy
for solving this challenge. One part of the solution might be to bring the issue
and the framing of the issue onto the public agenda, in the hopes of an eventual
spillover onto the policy agenda.

5.2

Climate risk mitigation and the long-term future

Energy use and energy policy is currently on the global political agenda primarily
because of climate change-related risks: Fossil fuels are a major emitter of greenhouse gases that, through gradual accumulation in the atmosphere, contribute
to global climate change. Climate change represents a major medium-term risk
26

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

for humankind; there is a nontrivial probability that climate change could have
catastrophic consequences, such as making traditional agriculture essentially
impossible or, in a worst-case scenario, making Earth uninhabitable for humans
(given our current level of technological adaptability) [62, 63, 64]. Climate change
is an existential risk, and the mitigation of climate change risks is rightfully a
global priority.
Ideally, the mitigation of climate risks will coincide with and contribute
to the development of improved or even entirely novel sources of energy that
will increase the long-term chances of humankind’s survival by means of space
colonization. This is not an unrealistic expectation, given that the mitigation of
climate risks consists, to a large degree, of replacing fossil fuels with other, less
harmful sources of energy. However, some climate change mitigation strategies
might actually harm the long-term prospects of humankind.
First, it is possible that dominant climate change mitigation strategies will
actively exclude any form of nuclear energy from the repertoire of climatefriendly energy sources. Existing and experimental (molten salt) fission reactors
could play a significant role in replacing carbon-heavy energy sources, but proenvironmental attitudes often overlap with anti-nuclear sentiments [65]. As a
result, and in combination with other problems such as large-scale market failures
of existing fission reactors (one of the reasons being that generating electricity
from fossil fuels is cheaper) [66], nuclear fission does not currently have significant standing as a “cleantech” contribution to climate change mitigation. From a
long-term perspective, an unfavorable view of nuclear energy in the context of
climate change might mean that technological progress in the areas of nuclear
fission and fusion might come to a halt (for example, due to explicit bans or
implicit disincentives). If such a scenario came to be, our attempts at colonizing
space would almost certainly fail: There are currently no alternatives to fission
and fusion, and it is highly improbable that Solar power alone could suffice for
sustaining extraterrestrial habitats.
Second, there is some probability that climate change mitigation strategies
will change the social order towards a degrowth philosophy. Degrowth is a
vague socio-economic concept and social movement that, in general, calls for a
contraction of the global and national economies by means of lower production
and consumption rates, and, to some degree, to more profound changes to the
“capitalist” system of economic production [67]. Degrowth or degrowth-like
approaches are being actively considered as climate risk mitigation strategies
[68, 69], and degrowth would almost certainly be a highly effective measure for
mitigating climate change. After all, if we were to drastically reduce or even
completely eliminate the (industrial) sources of greenhouse gases, the amount of
greenhouse gases that are being emitted would accordingly drastically sink. From
the long-term perspective of humankind’s survival, degrowth is problematic in
27

Future of energy

ZIPAR Discussion Paper Series

at least two ways. First, there is a risk that the general contraction of economic
activity would also slow or eliminate progress in the domain of energy, which
would, in turn, reduce the probability of successful space colonization due to an
absence of suitable energy sources. Second, and more fundamental: If degrowth
were to become a dominant societal paradigm, it is uncertain whether the longterm survival of humankind by means of space colonization would be regarded
a desirable goal. In a literal sense, establishing extraterrestrial colonies would
mean growth; the size of the total human population would grow, and the area of
space-time that humans occupy would grow.
In a more philosophical sense, degrowth might even be antithetical to space
colonization. Even though both degrowth and space colonization have a similar
moral goal – increasing wellbeing – , the ends to that goal are very different.
Within degrowth philosophy, the goal is, metaphorically speaking, not to “live
beyond our means”: We should strive for “ecological balance”, and such a state
should increase the average wellbeing. But the frame of reference is the status
quo; Earth and humankind as we know it today. Space colonization, on the other
hand, operates with a much larger frame of reference: All the future generations
of humans (and other sentient beings) who could enjoy wellbeing if we succeed
in colonizing space – and who will categorically be denied that wellbeing if we
fail to colonize space [70]. The goal of space colonization as a moral project is not
to live beyond our means, but to actively redefine and expand what our means
are through scientific and technological progress.
