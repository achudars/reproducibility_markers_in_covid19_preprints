Abstract
In economic evaluations of health technologies, health outcomes are commonly measured in terms of QALYs. QALYs are the product of time and
health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life, in turn, is determined by a social tariff, which is supposed to reflect the public’s preference
over health states. This paper argues that, because of the tariff’s role in the
societal decision making process, it should not be understood as merely a
statistical model, but as a major instrument of democratic participation. I
outline what implications this might have for both the method used to aggregate individual preferences, and the set of individuals whose preferences
should count. Alternative tariff specifications are explored, and future research directions are proposed.
Keywords – QALY; health state; valuation; tariff; social choice; democracy;
normative theory; conceptual model; decision making.

Introduction

2

Societal decisions, on whether or not certain health programs should be publicly

3

provided, are often informed by economic evaluations: The (additional) costs and

4

health benefits of, say a new drug a compared against alternatives courses of ac-

5

tion (e.g. another drug). The results are often summarised into an incremental

6

cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (Dakin et al., 2015). In England, as in many other

7

countries, health effects are measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY),

8

which are the product of length and health-related quality of life. The measure-

9

ment of health-related quality of life, in turn, consists of a two components: a

10

descriptive system of health states and a social tariff which maps these states to

11

preference values.

12

The currently preferred instrument for valuing health outcomes in England is the

13

UK social EQ-5D 3L tariff (NICE, 2012; MVH Group 1995). Based on democratic

14

principles, it is based on the preferences of (around 3,000) members of the gen-

15

eral public. When the tariff is applied in economic evaluations, it is supposed to

16

incorporate societal (instead of patients’) preferences into health policy decisions

17

regarding the allocation of (publicly funded) health care resources (Whitehead &

18

Ali, 2010). Therefore, I argue that tariffs should not be understood as merely sta-

19

tistical models, but as a major instruments of collective choice. As such, tariffs do

20

not only have to adhere to scientific standards, but also need to reflect the norms

21

and democratic principles of society as a whole.

22

Despite the considerable impact on health policy decision-making, the implied

23

value judgments of social tariffs have received very little attention, and research

24

into their conceptual and normative basis has been scarce (Devlin et al., 2017;

25

Dewitt et al., 2017). In this paper, I make a first attempt to examine the role

26

of the tariff within the wider decision-making framework from a collective choice

27

perspective (section 2). I go on to highlight the (im)possibility of aggregating

28

individual health state preferences into a societal preference (section 3), and outline

29

further implications for health state valuation studies (section 4), before I propose

30

future research directions (section 5).

2

The health policy decision-making framework

32

In the following, I will provide a basic framework for economic evaluations, incor-

33

porating health state values from the general population. For clarity, some simpli-

34

fications will be made (e.g. uncertainty is being ignored). Moreover, it should be

35

noted that the QALY is built on strong assumptions, including, among others, the

36

measurability of interpersonally comparable, cardinal preferences over hypothet-

37

ical health states (Carr-Hill, 1989; Dolan, 2000; Dolan et al., 2005; Fleurbaey &

38

Hammond 2004; Lipscomb et al., 2009). Challenging these assumptions is outside

39

the scope of this paper, and the function of the social tariff is only investigated

40

within this given context.

41

2.1

42

Suppose society consists of N individuals, whose preference functions over m

43

(mutually exclusive) health states, given by H = {h1 , h2 , · · · , hm }, are denoted

44

p1 , p2 , · · · , pn , with p : H → u, (u ∈ R, u ≤ 1). Note that preference values

45

over health states are measured on a ratio scale, in relation to the preference

46

for ’full health’, denoted h∗ , with p0 (hj ) =

47

states is captured by the social tariff t(.), which is an aggregate function of in-

48

dividual preference functions, given by t(hj ) = f (p01 (hj ), p02 (hj ), · · · , p0n (hj )). Let

49

S = {s11 , s12 , · · · , s21 , · · · , snm } then denote an n × m matrix containing individu-

50

als’ ’health state times’, i.e. the amount of time that individual i spent in state j.

51

If we assume additive separability and zero time preference, the number of QALYs

52

(as valued by society) accrued by all members of society Qt = {q1t , q2t , · · · , qnt } is

53

determined by the products of individuals’ health state times and the correspond-

54

ing societal valuation, given by Qt = t(H) ∗ S. The total number of QALYs in

55

society can be evaluated by the following formula:

2.2

The role of the tariff in societal decision-making

57

The aim of the health system is assumed to be the maximisation of QALYs, sub-

58

ject to a fixed budget constraint. The marginal opportunity costs for £20,000

59

are further assumed to be 1 QALY. The resulting decision-making framework is

60

outlined below, and figure 1 provides a schematic overview (superscripts are used

61

to link the text with the figure).

62

Given the stated objective, the societal decision(12) over some health program a de-

63

pends on its ICER(10) , compared to its most cost-effective alternative a. While the

64

incremental costs(8) , given by ∆ca = [cN |a] − [cN |a], can, in principle, be directly

65

observed in a study(6) , the incremental QALYs(9) ∆Qta are not only determined by

66

the incremental health outcomes(7) ∆Sa = ([S|a] − [S|a]), but also by the social

67

tariff(5) t(.), with ∆Qta = t(H) ∗ ∆Sa . To derive t, however, first individual health

68

state preferences(3) have to be elicited, e.g. using the time-trade-of method(2) .

69

Preferences are then aggregated(4) , as specified by f (.), before the tariff can be

70

used to translate health outcomes into QALYs.

Ovals represent functions and rectangles the inputs/outputs.

Finally, program a should be adopted if its ICER is smaller or equal to £20,000.
71

The societal decision function(11) W (.) can be defined as follows:

 0 if
W (a) =
 1 if

∆ca
∆Qta

> 20, 000

∆ca
∆Qta

≤ 20, 000

72

The overview (see figure 1) illustrates the central role of the social tariff t(.) in the

73

decision-making framework: the tariff specifies the societal value of the time indi-

74

viduals spend in any health state other than full health, and thereby, it determines

75

to some, potentially great extent whether or not a health program is considered

76

cost-effective. Depending on the distribution of preferences, the method of aggre-

77

gation f (.) can, thus, also have significant impact on societal decision-making.

78

2.3

79

Before I go on to discuss the aggregation of individual preference functions, it will

80

be useful to briefly consider what the resulting societal preference values represent.

81

First of all, it should be noted that the current social tariff framework is fundamen-

82

tally incompatible with the notion of utility maximisation. This is because, even

83

though the tariff is based on individual (health state) preferences, it is not individ-

84

ual i’s own valuation of their own health state(s) that informs societal decisions.

85

Instead, a change in individual i’s health from state j to state k is valued by the

86

aggregate preference of society. This includes individuals who are neither in health

87

state j nor k, as well as individuals who are not affected by the decision, at all.

88

Since individual i’s preference will generally not be identical to the societal prefer-

89

90

The social tariff as an instrument of collective choice

ence, p0i (hj ) 6≡ t (hj ), it follows that maximising societal QALYs is not the same as
P P
Pn Pm 0
maximising health-related utilities: ni=1 m
j=1 t (hj )∗sij 6≡
i=1
j=1 pi (hj )∗sij·

91

A more convincing interpretation of the QALY can be derived from ’extra-welfarism’,

92

which offers an alternative approach for the evaluation of health policies beyond

93

utilities (Brouwer et al., 2008; Coast et al., 2008; Cookson 2005; Culyer 1989).

94

Here, health is not primarily recognized as a source of utility, but it has a social

95

value in itself. In fact, this is how the QALY seems to be generally understood:

5

96

as an operational definition of health. Hence, the social tariff should not be re-

97

garded as a summary function of individual (health-related) utilities, but rather as

98

a mechanism, through which society collectively derives an interpersonally com-

99

parable index of value for different sets of health functionings (Cookson 2005).

100

3

Aggregating individuals’ health state preferences

101

3.1

102

With only few exceptions (e.g. Shaw et al., 2010), health state valuation studies

103

have used the arithmetic mean to aggregate individual preferences into a societal

104

preference (Xie et al., 2014; MVH, 1995). If the tariff would reflect (health-related)

105

utilities, the use of the mean could potentially be justified by utilitarian welfare

106

maximisation through potential pareto improvements. But, as argued above, the

107

current framework is incompatible with this interpretation of the QALY (Devlin et

108

al., 2017). Within the ’extra-welfarist’ approach, however, there does not seem to

109

be a normative basis for selecting the mean over any of the (infinitely) many other

110

possible aggregation functions (Roberts 1980). In particular, it cannot be assumed

111

that there is an objectively true value for each health state. Differences between

112

individuals’ health state valuations can, therefore, not be regarded as measurement

113

errors, which cancel out when taking the average. Rather, differences have to be

114

understood as genuine disagreements. If all individuals had similar preferences,

115

however, the choice of the aggregation method would be trivial. Yet, empirical

116

studies show that health state preferences differ considerably (Xie et al., 2014;

117

also see figure 2), and the societal preference is thus intimately dependent on the

118

method of aggregation – if the method is changed, the outcome might differ. This

119

raises the question: how should preferences be aggregated?

120

The (im)possibility of aggregating individual preferences into a social preference

121

has been extensively discussed in social choice and welfare economic literature.

122

Various welfare functions and voting rules have been axiomatically examined and

123

their attractions and drawbacks have been described (Arrow 1951; Brandt et al.,

Problem statement

6

124

2016; Fleurbaey & Hammond 2004; Sen 2018). Seminal findings suggest that no

125

method can be assumed to be unequivocally superior, or unanimously accepted.

126

The decision which method to use always requires making value judgments. This

127

means, to be able to say one method is better than another, it first needs to be

128

decided what values should be incorporated. However, since this question has not

129

yet been addressed in the context of population-based health state valuations, it

130

is unclear what properties these functions should have. Currently, it is not even

131

obvious what types of aggregation functions are admissible at all. In a recent dis-

132

cussion paper, Devlin et al. (2017) suggested that a reasonable starting point for

133

conceptualising a social tariff would be the fundamental principle of the democratic

134

system within which the health system operates: the majority rule. As an exam-

135

ple, they consider the most common measures of central tendency (mode, mean,

136

median), but do not derive at a conclusive solution. In the following, I expand on

137

their analysis and show that none of the three measures can appropriately reflect

138

the majority view.

3.2

Measures of central tendency and the majority rule

140

3.2.1. The arithmetic mean

141

The arithmetic mean is commonly used to aggregate preferences in health state

142

valuation studies (Xie et al., 2014; MVH, 1995), and it has convenient properties:

143

it is easy to compute and to predict using regression models, and, unlike the

144

median or mode, it is consistent with [f (p1 (h1 ), pn (h1 ))] − [f (p1 (h2 ), pn (h2 ))] =

145

f ([p1 (h1 )−p1 (h2 )], [pn (h1 )−pn (h2 )]). However, it takes into account the preference

146

intensity of individuals, and thus does not reflect the majority view: the mean gives

147

more weight to individual values that are distant from the average, which makes

148

it sensitive to outliers. This clearly conflicts with the democratic principle of

149

’one man (or woman), one vote’. As an example, consider figure 2. The histogram

150

shows the distribution of 735 individual preferences values for the EQ-5D 3L health

151

state, ’11131’ (no problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities and no anxiety

152

or depression, but extreme pain or discomfort). The mean value is 0.24, but 58%

153

prefer a higher value. Individuals with a preference value of -1 had much more

154

weight in the estimation than individuals with preference values of 1 (1.6 times),

155

0.5 (4.7 times), or 0.3 (19.4 times).

156

3.2.2. The mode

157

Selecting the most frequent value from a complex distribution of cardinal prefer-

158

ence values seems to be meaningless. The frequency of values mainly depends on

159

the accuracy of the measurement and the extent of up- and down-rounding. In

160

our example (figure 2), 1 is by far the most frequent value (n=72). However, 90%

161

(n=663) prefer a lower value. Overall, in the MVH (1995) data, all health states

162

have a mode value of either 1, 0, or -1.

163

3.2.3. The median

164

At first glance, the median provides a promising alternative: according to the

165

Median Voter Theorem (Black 1948), a majority will select the outcome most pre-

166

ferred by the median voter (given single peaked preferences). Correspondingly, in

167

our example, there is no majority for a value that is higher (preferred by 49.5%)

8

168

or lower (preferred by 48.3%) than the median (=0.43). From this one might con-

169

clude that this is the value that the majority supports. However, the Median Voter

170

Theorem only applies to voting on one dimension. For multiple dimensions, there

171

is not necessarily a stable majority, and societal preferences might be intransitive

172

(McKelvey 1976). For the valuation of multiple health states, this means that al-

173

though median values would reflect the majority view for each state individually,

174

combining the median values of multiple health states into a social tariff might

175

not represent the majority view globally. Moreover, the interpretation of median

176

preferences is further complicated by the fact that the difference between the me-

177

dians for two health states is not equal to the median difference. This can lead to

178

paradoxical results, as the following example may illustrate.

179

Suppose individuals x1, x2 and x3 have preferences over health states h1 and h2 :

180

x1 prefers h1 (px1 (h1 ) = 0.65) over h2 (0.44); x2 also prefers h1 (0.94) over h2

181

(0.83); and only x3 prefers h2 (0.98) over h1 (0.34). One could thus conclude that

182

a majority of individuals prefers h1 . However, the median values for the two health

183

states are 0.65 and 0.83 (the geometric medians are 0.68 and 0.72), which would

184

indicate that the group prefers h2 . See figure 3 for a visual illustration.

Figure 3: The ’median health
state paradox’. Even though
a majority of individuals (green
dots) prefers health state h1 over
state h2, based on median (blue)
or geometric median (red) health
state values, the group prefers
h2.

3.3

Constructing a democratic social tariff

186

None of the three measures of central tendency discussed above are able to incor-

187

porate the majority rule into the social tariff, let alone into decision-making. As

188

the ’median health state’ example has shown, it even seems questionable whether

189

the majority rule can be meaningfully applied at the health state level at all. In

190

the following, I will thus outline an alternative approach: a re-formulation of the

191

social tariff as a majority voting system over health programs (see figure 4). Even

192

if the proposed method is unlikely to be considered a viable alternative to the

193

current system in the near future, it might serve to illustrate the conception of the

194

social tariff as an instrument of democratic participation.

195

As noted above, the incremental societal QALYs of program a are given by ∆Qta

196

whereby the superscript indicates that incremental health state times ∆S are val-

197

ued using the societal tariff t(.). Alternatively, QALY estimates could be de-

198

rived from individuals’ health state preference functions directly, with ∆Qpai =

199

p0i (H) ∗ ∆S. The societal health effects of program a would then be evaluated by

200

all individuals i ∈ N separately (i.e. how many QALYs does program a generate

201

in society from the perspective of individual i?). Imposing the societal efficiency

202

decision rule W (.) on everyone, individual i’s decision function is given by

di (a) =


 0 if
 1 if

∆cc
p
∆Qai
∆ca
p
∆Qai

≤ 20, 000
> 20, 000

203

Subsequently, the societal decision rule could be re-formulated as a majority voting

204

system: individual decisions d1 (a), d2 (a),..., dn (a) could be summed up, and a

205

should be adopted by society, if a majority of individuals ’voted’ for it. The

206

modified societal decision function W 0 is given below.

 0 if
W 0 (a) =
 1 if

207

If more than two health programs are evaluated at the same time, majority voting

208

has important limitations, and alternative voting rules should be considered (e.g.

209

Brandt et al., 2016 provide a contemporary overview).

210

It should be stressed that the proposed change would only affect the level and

211

the method of aggregation, while the source (the general population) and the ob-

212

jects (hypothetical health states) of preferences remain the same. Conceptually,

213

however, this method offers a clear advantage over the current system: it would

214

give all individuals equal weight in the decision. Furthermore, it would also be

215

more transparent, in terms of how many individuals do and do not support a given

216

policy decision. Thereby, the voting system might not only be more democratic,

217

but also easier to understand than an average societal health state tariff. Never-

218

theless, one might rightly object that the informational demands of this system

219

would be significant. Detailed primary data on the health outcomes, as well as

220

individuals’ health state preference functions would be required. Moreover, if the

221

threshold of 20,000 GBP is assumed to be based on the societal opportunity costs,

222

each individual could, in principle, have a different threshold, depending on how

223

many QALYs are currently being generated in the health care system from their

224

perspective (i.e. according to their individual preference function).

Figure 4: A democratic reformulating of the social tariff as a majority voting system.

225

Democratic representativeness of the social tariff

226

From a democratic perspective, it is not sufficient to address the question how

227

preferences should be aggregated. It also needs to be determined whose preferences

228

should count. Even if the public is to be accepted as the source of preferences, it

229

has not been established what practical implications this may have for health state

230

valuation studies. In the following, I make some recommendations for aspects that

231

should be considered.

232

Firstly, the surveyed group of individuals should be representative of the society

233

for which a decision is to be made. This means, participants should be selected

234

randomly. After the data are collected, all reasonable efforts should be made

235

to retain representativeness throughout subsequent analyses. This implies that

236

incomplete cases should not be excluded, nor should missing values be ignored.

237

The exclusion of 399 (12%) participants from the in the MVH study (1994) because

238

of missing values appears disconcerting in this regard. Missingness is unlikely to be

239

(completely) random, and appropriate imputation methods should be considered

240

(Rubin 1976). Moreover, seemingly irrational preferences – e.g. assigning the same

241

value to all health states (Lamers et al., 2006) – should also not automatically

242

be removed. Preferences might be consistent with some underlying beliefs, and

243

researchers should not presume to make judgements about them (Devlin et al.,

244

2017).

245

Secondly, democratic representativeness also commands that only those individuals

246

are considered in the tariff, who are members of the very society, for which decisions

247

are to be made. Health preferences vary across different regions and cultures

248

(Gerlinger et al., 2019). NICE’s decision to use a UK-wide, instead of an English

249

tariff, to value health outcomes seems problematic in this regard, as it might well be

250

the case that the four UK countries also have distinct preference profiles. One could

251

take this a step further and argue that local authorities should also consider the

252

use of local tariffs to evaluate local health programs, if the preferences of the local

253

community are assumed to differ from the rest of the country. Whether the benefits

254

of more accurate QALY estimates actually outweigh the costs of constructing local

12

255

tariffs, will depend on the regional heterogeneity of preferences and the uncertainty

256

around the policy decision. However, due to the scale of health care budgets, wrong

257

decisions, based on biased estimates, could have significant opportunity costs.

258

Finally, it seems self-evident that an individual’s participation in collective, demo-

259

cratic decisions needs to be intentional and deliberate. First and foremost, this

260

means that participants in health state valuation studies need to be informed about

261

the (potential) purpose of the survey (Israel 2015). Using participants’ stated pref-

262

erences to inform policy decisions without obtaining informed consent for doing so

263

does not only violate the autonomy of the participants, but it also seems utterly

264

undemocratic. Given the potential impact their responses may have on health

265

policy decisions, some individuals may want to give their answers more thought,

266

and some may also prefer to abstain from participating. Hausman (2010) fur-

267

ther proposed that societal decisions should not be based on individuals’ ’private’

268

health state values at all. Instead, public deliberations would be required to derive

269

an adequate information basis for economic evaluations. I would argue that, at

270

the very least, participants in health state valuation studies should be given the

271

opportunity to reflect on their responses and to seek additional information about

272

the health states they are not familiar with (Devlin et al., 2019; Gansen et al.,

273

2019).

274

5

275

I have outlined several research gaps related to the use of social tariffs in economic

276

evaluations.

277

Considering the significance of the tariff for health policy decision-making, further

278

research is urgently needed. It seems particularly important to establish a better

279

theoretical basis for the use of social tariffs in health economic evaluations. Before

280

more appropriate theories and methods can be developed, however, it will be the

281

responsibility of the decision makers to better define what the objective(s) of the

282

health system, and what the function of the social tariff ought to be (Devlin et

How to move forward

13

283

al., 2017). It should be stressed that the group of decision makers that should be

284

considered relevant does not only include elected politicians and civil servants, but

285

also members of the general public, on which ultimately all the power in a demo-

286

cratic society rests. Health economists can support the search for more appropri-

287

ate preference aggregation methods by translating normative value judgments into

288

corresponding decision rules. To this end, Dewitt et al. (2019) proposed a deliber-

289

ative approach for eliciting the meta-preferences over aggregation procedures. In

290

a first step, relevant ethical norms and societal values are identified from decision

291

makers. Potential social tariffs are then constructed and subsequently presented

292

to the participants. The preferences over the aggregation procedures (i.e. their

293

meta-preferences) are then elicited in an iterative process.

Under the assumption that the social tariff represents a major instrument of demo-

296

cratic participation, this paper raises several critical questions and challenges the

297

conceptual foundation of the current framework. Although the practical implica-

298

tions are still to be determined, a democratic (re)interpretation of the social tariff

299

would undoubtedly have important consequences for population-based health state

300

valuations. A new line of research is proposed to establish a conceptual basis for

301

social tariffs from a democratic perspective.
