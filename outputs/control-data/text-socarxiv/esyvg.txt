"18" "Abstract"
"19" "Objectives : T he likelihood that  serial murderers  are responsible for  most  unresolved homicides  and missing persons was examined  by investigating the accounting of the phenomenon in the context of a declining prevalence ."
"20" "Methods :  A mixed methods approach was used , consisting of  a review of a sample of unresolved homicides ,  a comparative analysis of the frequency of known serial homicide series and unresolved serial homicide series ,  and  semi-structured  interviews of experts ."
"21" "Results : T he past decade contained almost half the cases (13%) that existed at the  1980s  peak of serial homicide (27%) . Only  282 (1.3%)  strangled females made up the  22,444 unresolved homicides  reviewed. M ost  expert  respondents thought it unreasonable  that  any meaningful proportion of missing  persons  cases  are  victims of serial homicide."
"22" "Conclusions : Technology, s hifts in  o ffending  b ehavior , p roactive  l aw  e nforcement  a ction , and v igilance of  s ociety  have transformed serial killing and  aids in viewing offenders   as  people impacted by societal shifts and cultural norms.  The absence of  narrative details inhibited some aspects of the review. A n exhaustive list of known unresolved serial homicide series  remained elusive as   some  missing persons are never reported .  F uture research should incorporate  those  intending  to murder serially ,  but whose efforts were stalled by arrest, imprisonment ,  or death ."
"23" "KEYWORDS : serial killer, recidivism, homicide, definition, criminology"
"24" "S erial homicide is given  undue  attention  as  over half of women  killed  in  the United States  are  felled by  intimate partner s  ( Khazan , 2017) .  T he  impact  that  serial murders  have  on rates of violence is  overstated  due to  influence  by congressional mandates, journalistic license,  popular   opinion,   entertainment  culture,  media exaggeration,  shifts in public policy prerogatives, experiences of surviving victims ,   and  agendas of  killers themselves .   C onfusion surrounding homicide rate increases (Asher, 2017; Economist Data Team, 2017;  Park & Katz ,  2016;  Winkley , 2017),  missing persons (Davis & Hermann, 2017)  and  the  sentiment that all killers are  serial  murderers merely stripped of means and opportunity (M. William Phelps, personal communication, 14 April 2016)   has sustained  a   reliance on anecdotes   to inform on serial murder .   Because t hese  knowledge gaps  hinder   empirical analysis ,  impede study,  interrupt investigations  and  continu e  a legacy of stereotypes , this current research aims to provide perspective regarding the presence of serial murderers in modern society."
"25" "S erial murder is often probed as the first possibility as in recent panics along 93 rd  Street ( Ferrise , 2017; Goldenberg, 2017;  Horansky , 2017), jogging paths (Williams, 2016), waterways ( Herzog, 2016;  Rocheleau , 2017),  trail s  ( Paul, 2017 ) and  homeless camps ( Robinson,   2018 )  even though  homicide s are   generally  a one-off occurrence s , and  most offenders that fit a deviant profile  ( Lohr , 2016b)  are not serial murderers.  L aw enforcement organization s   ( LEO )  fear that lack of vigilance could result in failures like Project KARE ( McClearn , 2017)  and  increasingly rely on offender profiling  rather than await  an investigative “tipping point” before taking conceptual leaps pertaining to serial murder   ( LePard et al., 2015).  The juxtaposition of  characteristics  related to victimization can be indicative of serial murder activity ,  but  constant analysis of  these groupings together can cause police detectives ( Augenstein , 2017;  Lohr , 2016a ), citizen sleuths (Thomas, 2017), journalists ( Dissell , 2017;  Guenthner , 2017) and family members (Anthony, 2015) to draw non-existent parallels between cases based only on minor similarities ."
"26" "Are Serial  Homicide Offenders   Hidden in the Murder “Surge” ?"
"27" "Attorney General  Jeff Sessions  has called a recent “surge” in murder rates a “dangerous permanent trend” (Bump, 2017) . Subsumed within this “surge” is posited to be an increase in serial homicide ,   even though  homicidal violence has been declining for decades (Pinker, 2012;  Roser , 2017).  Stote  and Standing (1995) found no sudden emergence of serial killers when investigating the supposed epidemic of serial homicide. Still, the belief  that  many successful killers have gone undetected endures (Giannangelo, 2012) bolstered by coverage of abysmal homicide clearance rates ( Gramlich , 2017 ), issues facing detectives ( Henderson, Tracy,  Parascandola  &  Mcshane , 2016;  Ransom, 2016; Kelly, Lowery & Rich, 2016 ) reports of the sheer number of unresolved homicides (Stein, 2017) reference to the latter as a national crisis ( Adcock, 2017 ) and speculative estimates  based on bad  data (Lester, 1995; Miller, 2014). The lack of  consensus  regarding the   absence of   official  statistics  on   serial murderers (McNamara & Morton, 2004)  bolsters s upport  for  the resurgence of true crime  which  is built on  assertions  that serial murderers are  not only  the worst type of criminal ( Shenfeld , 2018) , but that they   are  also   ‘ everywhere ’  (Byrne, 2017;  Dumcius , 2017; Key, 2018;  Kutner , 2017;   Nickeas , 2018;   Sasko , 2018; Sweeney, Williams-Harris,  Gellatly , 2017;  Whiffen , 2017 ) .   These ideas are  remnants of an  assumption regarding linkages between thousands of unresolved homicides (Yaksic, 2018a)  and each has  given rise to  the misconception  that  serial homicide  is not   declin ing ."
"28" "Frequency  Estimation  of Undetectable Events"
"29" "Certain  factors  affect   frequency estimates   (Moss,  2015 ; Racine,  2015) ,   such as   t he  unknown and supposed  proportion of the “dark figure of crime”  that  serial murderers occupy .  T he re is a  discordance in the relatedness between missing and unidentified persons, un re solved murders, no-body homicides, equivocal and mislabeled deaths, the “missing missing”  (Quinet, 2007) ,  and  the unclaimed dead  [ a grouping  referred to herein as  ‘ the discordance ’ ] .   Endeavors to address the incidence of serial homicide have stalled since the 1990s ( Hinch  & Hepburn, 1998;  Kiger , 1990; Mott, 1999; Schlesinger, 2001;  Stote  & Standing, 1995 ) while  assumptions about the scope of investigations (Freeman, 2018)   fuel  the  b elief that serial murder  is an  epidemic .   C laim s of  two serial killers  operating   in every city ,  that  between 200 and 500 serial murderers kill 2,000 to 3,500 victims a year  ( Miller, 2014 ) ,  or that  two-thousand serial murderers are active  ( Wilkinson, 2017 )  are   more than seventy times the average number of offenders apprehended  annually  in the United States .  Meanwhile, m ore conservative estimates  suggest  the number  of active serial murderers  to be  around 30 ,  in a given year ( Pappas, 2018 ) ."
"30" "Stranger Murderers and the Conjecture of Additional Victims"
"31" "McIntire (2016)  has  use d  data visualizations to illustrate  that the profile of a serial killer is more nuanced than Hollywood depictions,  popularized by  a  study conducted  in the 1980s  by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (Beasley, 2004) and showcased in  the Netflix series  Mindhunter   ( Trenholm , 2017) .   T he myths about serial homicide  originated  with the FBI ,  namely   through  the   u se of  vague  phraseology to explain the pervasiveness of offenders .   S erial homicide s were  classif ied as  “stranger murders” (Reid, 2017a)  which led   to a still  unrefuted  theory that link s  falling  homicide  clearances  with  an increase in serial murders  (Schlesinger, 2001) .  Researchers have struggled with the suggestion that not all serial murderers are predetermined to become killers and that they are not compelled to complete their actions."
"32" "I t is inaccurate to attribute most stranger or unknown homicides to serial murder   ( Hinch  and Hepburn,  1998)   because of  quantification  problems such as incomplete data ; doing so  invite s  conjecture about the missing records. Quinet and Nunn (2014)  challenge   the myth that unresolved homicides are disproportionately stranger homicides .   They revealed  that decreased clearance rates are not due to increased stranger homicides  and  that the hidden proportion of unknown offender homicides that are stranger homicides has not increased.  Pastia , Davies,  and   Wu (2017) found that  incident characteristics  -  notably drug or gang involvement  -  determine diff erences in clearance , a  population  that   inh abit s  the “dark figure of crime”   ( Sarteschi ,  2016) ."
"33" "Missing Persons and Serial Murder"
"34" "Shanafelt  and  Pino  (2013) propose that  serial killing  should  be  examine d  in a larger context  as  these offenders   are credited with scores of both unknown perpetrator homicides and deaths of missing persons ( Homant  & Kennedy, 2009). I t is rare for serial murders to occur without  the discovery of remains  (LePard , Demers,  Langan , & Rossmo , 2015) and rarer for the results of confession s  to contain references to unclaimed bodies or for offenders to be the subject of “no-body” prosecutions (Tad  DiBiase , personal communication, 5 December 2016) .   However, due to   a  lack of  accurate data on the number of missing persons  who   are  homicide  victims, the percentage of missing persons  killed  by serial murderers  is   un known.  The state of missing  persons has been  called  a “silent mass disaster” (Ritter, 2007) ,  but the majority of records in the  FBI’s Nat ional Crime Information Center  database in 2014 (635,155) were cleared at a rate of 99.87 percent  (Yoder, 2016).  Reflective of the FBI clearance rate,  missing persons are  frequently   found unharmed with a small minority reaching the rank of “critical missing” ( Jones, 2017 )."
"35" "Has Serial Murder Been Redefined  to Inflate the Problem ?"
"36" "S erial killing incidence rates  are   complicate d by a narrow   focus on victim thresholds  and  time intervals ( Homant  & Kennedy, 2009) , a n   emphasis   on terminology (Reid, 2017b) and an inconsistent application of rigor to inquiries ( Dowden, 2005;  Levin & Fox, 2017 ) , all of  which  are tension that  distract  from  empirical   investigation  ( DeLisi ,  2015) .  The FBI’s r educ tion of  the  victim threshold   from three to two   is  interpreted as  a maneuver that  artificially expand s  the boundaries   of a series  by accommodating offenders whose crimes fall short of earning categorization as “serial”  ( Yaksic, 2018b ) .  This may   make  the ‘serial killer problem’  appear more significant ( Hodgkinson , 2016) ,  but  even in this context,   there  appears to be a  decrease  in  serial murder ."
"37" "To test the impact that definitions may have on how the decline is measured, serial and spree killers were separated using  components  distinct  to  these designations  ( Schlesinger ,  Ramirez,  Tusa , Jarvis,  &   Erdberg , 2017 ) .  Figure  1  shows that an inverse relationship exists  between these two categories ; when serial homicides increase, spree killings decrease and vice versa.  From   2014 to  the most recent  period  that data is available  (mid-2018) ,  it is evident that  both serial and spree killings have declined   along a similar downward trajectory."
"38" "[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]"
"39" "Stuck in the  “ Golden Age ”  of Serial Murder"
"40" "Those bereft of  serial murder’s  “golden age” (Reid, 2017a) posit theories of forensically aware  prolific  murderers with superior intellects and cunning abilities ,   contrary to a statistical decrease in  the subset of  murderers   who   kill  more than three times the FBI’s  current  allotted victim threshold   (Aamodt, Fox, Hickey,  Hinch ,  Labuschagne , Levin, McClellan, Nelson, Newton, Quinet, Steiger, White, & Yaksic, 2016) .  Morton, Tillman and Gaines (2014)  found   that  offenders took no precautions to disguise their identity ,  or avoid leaving evidence ,   over half the time and  took no action to alter crime scenes  almost half  of  the time .  The argument that serial murderers are trolling the countryside  undetected  is strengthened because some  are captured   by  chance ( Klint , 2016 ) ,  and commentary  advocates  additional victims  (Freeman, 2018)   through vague, speculative, or   nonexistent linkages (Harris, 2016;  Homan, 2015;  Mazzola , 2017; Smith, 2016; Ward &  Shehade , 2016).  Proponents of the idea that serial homicide is increasing may create or exaggerate a social problem ( Kiger , 1990) and yearn for a return to  a  profitable heyday."
"41" "Tracking a Precipitous Decline"
"42" "T he first anecdotal ( Yaksic , 2005), academic (Quinet, 2011) ,  and journalistic (Beam, 2011) mentions of a decline in serial homicide  appeared  long after  Cavanagh’s  (1993) work on experimental procedures in estimation . Potential reasons for the observed decline  ha d   been introduced (Yaksic, 2013, 2015 ;  Vronsky , 2018 ) ,  but  they have been  countered by  inaccurate representation of   statistics .   Quinet (2011) calls the reduction in detected cases of serial murder by decade  as,  “dramatic” and dispels the notion that a paucity of information has negatively affected  our  ability to assemble data ;  by noting that media coverage has increased to match the public interest.  Levin and Fox (2017) consider the collective impact of unresolved and  undetected homicides alongside the methodological caveats concerning the completeness of data, improvements to data accessibility  and  quality ,  awareness by LEOs and interest by the general public  to  conclud e  that serial homicide has diminished over the past decade or two."
"43" "A recent  snapshot of  stories related to  s erial homicide , alongside renewed interest in longstanding dormant series from wide ranging areas of the country ,  does  make it  appear  that the phenomenon  has increased,  but  the length  of these cases can  span many years .  A story appearing in the current  news cycle  may be the result of decades of activity.  For that reason,  it is deceptive to count the resolution of  these  homicides among the logs of their clearance year as it inflates serial murder’s contribution to end of year rates, further confusing efforts to establish an accurate snapshot of offending.  LEO s review  unresolved homicides  upon the discovery of suspected serial murders  and craft  readiness plan s   to  prepare for the appearance of  these killers  in their community ( Andreu , 2017)  which  enhances  the belief that crime rate increases can be attributed to  these offenders  when other  more plausible  explanations like  border offenses (Sean  Holstege , personal communication, 16 November 2016), human trafficking ( Department of Justice, 2017) ,   or gang violence  ( Hellgren , 2017;  Wang, 2016)  are to blame ."
"44" "The Killing Season"
"45" "Our lack of knowledge about the  number  of serial murderers in modern society was brought to the forefront by   the   docu -series  The Killing Season   ( Yandolino , 2016). This program advocated that serial homicide  offenders capitalize on systematic ignorance and broken systems to elude authorities, be they communication barriers among LEOs, weak mental health   institutional  structures, ineffectual legal proceedings and inadequate deterrents . These  concepts , so the series argues,  work in tandem to allow thousands to kill unmonitored and with impunity.  T o prove an increase ,   s howrunners   marr ied  three separate approaches : a n algorithm created by the Murder Accountability Project (MAP) (Hargrove,  Witzig ,  Icove , Harry, Arntfie ld, Yaksic, Lang, & Wolf, 2017),  tabulation s   from  the FBI’s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program ( ViCAP ) Highway Serial Killings Initiative (HSKI) (Newsweek Staff, 2011) ,  and the  “ Gone Girls ”  profile ( Warner, 2016 )."
"46" "The  MAP algorithm pinpoints clusters of supposed serial homicide activity by utili zing the FBI’s  Supplemental Homicide Reports  ( SHR )  to build a  count of un re solved homicides .   T he HSKI index es  the number of unexplained deaths occurring on or near major highways.  B oth  programs tally  two  killings  as related if even the remotest similarities are shared , a  methodology  that  overemphasizes  linkages  with little value if  they were to be  considered separately.  Emphasis on   these e fforts furthered the premise that hundreds of serial murderers are roaming unabated, “more than in our nightmares” (Romano, 2016)   which induced hysteria by inflating the threat serial murderers pose in modern society . MAP assum es  that uncaught offenders  are an overlooked facet of society  that  will inevitably kill again using identical methods of  operation ,  and that most cities retain a few active serial murderers ( Kolker , 2017) ,  assertions put forth in claims  of  jogger abductions (Hansen, 2016) ,  and murders staged a s suicides ( Augenstein , 2016)."
"47" "There are some caveats regarding  The Killing Season . The forecasting methods utilized by MAP were trained against the Green River Killer, notorious for a remarkably uncommon use of clustering victims in tight geographic spaces. The HSKI advertises the identification of 450 suspected offenders (Department of Justice, 2016) ,   but some unknown percentage of these  murderers would have to be ‘one-off’ killers given the publicized victim count of 750 deaths. Because a victim’s death must be paired with at least one other to be counted as part of a series (Morton & Hilts, 2008), the victim count should reach at least 900 if each offender killed at least twice. Efforts to link homicide victims to data points in the HSKI have been unsuccessful (Pacheco, 2010)  because  timelines relate d to the 450 potential suspects  span back  to  four decades (Terri Turner, personal communication, 15 December 2016)."
"48" "Suspected and Probable Explanations for the Decline in Serial Homicide"
"49" "Quinet (2011) credits progress made  in reducing  the serial  murderer’s  active killing periods and the average length of time they remain active  since the 1970s  to lessening “linkage blindness” and the creation of the  National Missing and Unidentified Persons System .  T o  grasp  the decline , w e must appreciate that  it  evidences that choices among the serial homicide offender population are possible and that small changes in their experiences have tremendous effects , meaning that  serial killers result  from  combinations of highly unique factors ( Homant  & Kennedy, 2009)  and  function   in terms of widely shared cultural and psychological processes ( Shanafelt  &  Pino , 2013)  and  social context ( Shanafelt  &  Pino , 2015). These influences are important when considering  changes in the incidence rates of serial killing over time ( Homant  & Kennedy, 2009) ,  categorized  here  into three domains:  Shifts in Offending Behavior, Proactive Law Enforcement Action, and Increased Vigilance of Society."
"50" "The landscape of  serial  murder has been impacted by technological advances that make some of the factors in the three domains possible. T he advent of cell phones, always connected social media accounts, assault prevention software (Glaser, 2016), facial recognition (Waddell, 2016), crime awareness mobile applications (Summers & Johnson, 2016) and the dawn of the  surveillance age place offenders at exceptional risk of being detected far earlier in their  offence behavior   (Sane,  Mugadlimath ,  Farooqui ,  Janagond , &  Mishra , 2017; Yaksic et al., 2018).  As potential victims turn  their  attention to alternatives that remove human contact from their day-to-day lives and migrate to services that will keep them indoors ( Vincent, 2017 ), serial homicide offenders may be unable to adapt to a future without ready access to potential victims."
"51" "Shifts in Offending Behavior"
"52" "Serial murder is no longer viewed as a shortcut to celebrity  status,  but  it  is still of interest around the world ( Donley &  Gualtieri , 2017 ). The unintentional byproduct of this attention pushes some maintaining homicidal ideation into behaviors such as a utilization of the underground sex trade and human trafficking networks, warehousing abductees (Conti, 2015),  alter ation   of modus operandi, retiring early or adopting tactics associated with the spree murderer (Aamodt & Yaksic, 2015). The Internet provides would-be offenders  an open forum to  explore activities  associated with leisure (Williams, 2016) – journaling ,  collecting pornography and photographs   – and  the opportunity to placate their  paraphilic  behavior  without exploiting unwilling participants. Much like virtual reality gaming supplies a vicarious outlet for violence, avenues  like sex dolls that simulate rape  ( Marie Claire, 2017 )  removes  contact with a victim, hence eliminating the murder of a victim ."
"53" "Furthermore, t wo occupations that serial murderers gravitate towards  –  long haul trucking and the medical industry – are placing workers under tighter scrutiny ( Bostock , 2017) or replacing them altogether (Davies, 2015). Younger offenders are growing up in a world where sentiment, supported by the collection of physical items that fuel imagination, fantasy and  rumination, is less emphasized. Enough is known about serial offending to preemptively assist would-be offenders in warding off potential symptoms  (Andrew  Reisner , personal communication, 6 May 2016) ,  or address malingering of individuals yearning to emulate these killers ( Fischer,  Beckson , & Dietz, 2016 ).  The rise in the self-harm epidemic ( Ingraham , 2016)   may be removing future threats from society."
"54" "Proactive Law Enforcement Action"
"55" "Jurisdictional conflicts between LEOs, once commonplace, have subsided in favor of increased collaboration. LEOs consult the public for assistance (Backus, 2015) more frequently ,  and  more readily  consider that a serial offender  could operate in their jurisdiction   ( Kaste , 2015). Advances in technology have made it easier for LEOs to ensure that abduction attempts (Larimer, 2016) are far less successful while harsher punishments and more restrictive use of parole ensures that would-be serial murderers are incarcerated for longer (Aamodt & Yaksic, 2015; Crockett, 2016). Many would-be serial murderers have been captured as LEOs clear rape kit backlogs (Mai, 2017;  Waltke  & Ames, 2017) and use familial DNA and genealogical techniques to reveal offenders ( Pelisek , 2017 ;  Smith, 2018 ). LEOs  benefit from the inexperience of younger offenders and stop them before they amass greater body counts (Yaksic et al., 2018)."
"56" "Increased Vigilance of Society"
"57" "Society has reversed a trend of ignorance of the serial murderers’ means and motives that had allowed them  the  freedom  that  they can no longer enjoy. Many longstanding myths have been broken, specifically regarding the “white, male, loner” stereotype  (Bartels, 2017; Branson, 2013; Hickey, 2014;  Kuhns  &  Coston , 2005; Sharma, 2018;  Walters,  Drislane , Patrick, & Hickey, 2015; Yaksic, 2006). S erial crimes had remained unresolved as investigators  adhered  too   firmly to stereotypes (Mott, 1999).   The disappearance of the 1960s “if-it-feels-good-do-it” ethos led to a  greater distrust of strangers, the abolishment of hitchhiking, and parents  who   are reluctant to allow children to play freely without supervision (Aamodt &  Surrette , 2013) , changes in behavior that have  diminished potential victim pools. Certain ruses  that serial murderers previously used to lure victims , such as posing as a photographer, are no longer plausible ,  as the veracity of others  is  easily verifiable  online . Efforts to educate the public about serial murder has led to awareness of the hallmarks ( Wall & Johnson, 2015), odd behaviors ( Gelinas  &  Hadjistavropoulos , 2015;  Woollaston , 2015), stalking offenses (Lloyd-Goldstein, 2000),  paraphilias  ( Yakeley  & Wood, 2014) ,  and violent tendencies toward animals (Broussard, 2016; Levin &  Arluke , 2016; Patterson-Kane, 2015 ) or others in youth ( Hartley-Parkinson , 2015). Countrywide movements are working to strip a generation of undrafted young men of their toxic masculinity (Gilbert, 2017) and instill in them ,  respect for women which may ward off future criminality."
"58" "Present Study"
"59" "Because LEOs have demonstrated that  homicide  clearance rates can be improved  by  implementing community policing  (a  tactic that do es  not expressly focus on addressing unresolved homicides ) , it is necessary to  review  the impact serial murderers may hav e  on homicide rates.   This  study  examine s   t he likelihood that  serial murderers  are responsible for  a significant majority of  unresolved homicides ;  by investigating the plausibility of reaching a true accounting of the phenomenon in the context of a declining prevalence .   We define  decline  as a decrease in year - over - year discoveries of new serial homicide series by way of apprehensions or clearances based on validated confessions or forensic linkages after the offender’s death."
"60" "Methods"
"61" "A mixed methods approach was used  in this study:  a review of   a sample of unresolved homicides ;  a  comparative  analysis of  the frequency of  known serial homicide series and unresolved serial homicide series ,   and   semi-structured  email  interviews of  thirty-four  experts ."
"62" "Materials"
"63" "Searching for Serial Homicide Victims  Among  The Hall of Justice Records"
"64" "T he Hall of Justice   (Sunlight Foundation,  2017 )  is  a  robust, searchable website that inventories criminal justice datasets  containing longitudinal records of unresolved homicides. Data  from  twenty- six  LEOs  across 19 states and districts is available . The population of these communities range from 51,000 to 5.3 million residents. Homicide  Watch Programs  (HWP) operating out of California contributed 15,187 cases .  Project Cold Case  of Florida  contributed  3,287 cases.  Table 1 shows  that  t he number of unresolved homicides included in this review totaled  22,444 . To ensure the status of the record was  legitimate,  updated ,  and current, unresolved homicide records must have been maintained by a LEO or journalistic source. Unresolved homicide records contained on the LEO websites spanned from a low of three to a high of 1,347. The Colorado and Georgia Bureaus of Investigation and Texas Department of Public Safety contained records also maintained by local LEOs  and  overlapping records  were removed . The earliest unresolved homicide originated in 1950 with  most  recent records generated in 2016. LEOs maintained data for an average of 28 years and HWPs for 16 years. To create a cohort most closely resembling  the “typical” serial homicide victim  ( James  &   Proulx , 2016;  Kraemer, Lord,  &  Heilbrun , 2004;   Sturup , 2018 ) ,  this  study   focused on the number of  female victims whose wrongful death resulted from  strangulation, suffocation or asphyxia.  There were no prerequisites for sexual violence to accompany the commission of homicides.  All  homicides resultant from firearm usage were excluded."

"66" "Comparative Analysis of Known Resolved and Known Unresolved Serial Homicide Series"
"67" "D ata on known resolved serial homicide series  was derived  from the Consolidated Serial Homicide Offender Database (CSHOD) (Aamodt et al., 2016).  To avoid controversy (Yaksic, 2018b), w e utilized the three - victim threshold to generate the count of  homicide  series  and excluded a ll non-US killers ,  those who operated in multiple countries including the US ,   and those  who killed solely prior to 1970 .  The final sample consisted of  1,638 offenders.   To avoid selection bias ( Harbort  &  Mokros ,  2001;  Kiger , 1990; Mott, 1999),  counts of separate and unique known unresolved serial homicide series were collected from various sources — media reports, textbooks (Mendoza, 2002; Newton, 2006), independent datasets ( Mott, 1999; Quinet, 2011 ) ,  and cases submitted to the authors.   A total of  104  k nown unresolved serial homicide  series spanning four and a half decades were assembled (see supplemental materials).  To generate Figure  2 , s eries conclusion dates were used as the endpoints and overlaid with counts of known resolved series from the  CSHOD."

"69" "Attitudes  Towards  Unresolved Murders in the Context of Serial Homicide"
"70" "To understand current attitudes on how  the discordance  relates to serial homicide, t hirty- four  subject matter experts  [ 15  professors,  seven  law enforcement officers,  five  practitioners ,  five  centers,  two   reporters ]  were  identified as maintaining expertise in one or more of three domains: 1)  serial  homicide ,  2)  missing persons,  3)  unresolved homicides  (Table  2 ) .   They were  interviewed via email   using a semi-structured approach  (see  A ppendix  1  for list of questions) ."
"71" "Results"
"72" "Hall of Justice  Records"
"73" "Of the 22,444 unresolved homicides, 282 (1.3%) were committed against females  and  caused by  strangulation, suffocation ,  or asphyxia ."
"74" "Known Resolved and Known Unresolved  Serial Homicide Series"
"75" "Figure  2   demonstrate s  that  the number of serial homicide  series  peaked in the 1980’s at  441 , a number previously seen at  258  in the 1970s . As of 1990 ,   these  number s  dropped to  414 , and continued  falling , marking 293   in 2000 . There have been 232 separate serial homicide series since 2010 . Overall, since its peak in the 1980’s ,  data shows a continuous decline in serial homicides ;   16 % of cases occurred in the 1970’s,  27 % in the 1980’s,  25 % in the 1990’s,  19 % in 2000 ’s and 13% since 2010 .   T he decline has co-occurred in both the known  unresolved and known resolved  serial homicide series. T he trajectory of both  series  –  known unresolved and known resolved  –  follow alongside each other in parallel ,  throughout the decades."
"76" "Attitudes  Towards   Unresolved Murders  in the Context of Serial Homicide"
"77" "LEO representatives disagreed with the premise that serial homicide is declining , claiming that  the number of  uncovered  killers is expansive   when coupled with the thousands more case linkages that would be possible if  ViCAP  was used  correctly . Most respondents felt that the lack of data on serial murderers could be explained by  the limited resources and administrative issues  which restrict   LEOs and hamper efforts to apprehend evolving  offenders  that are  “ more cautious and learning from the mistakes of others”. One respondent noted that the numbers of annual new un re solved homicides, missing persons ,  and unidentified bodies are “startling” and that record keeping  is  too inadequate to monitor these categories."
"78" "Professors on the whole were not convinced that serial homicide is increasing  and  claim ed  that  detection of serial murder has improved while overall counts are diminishing. R espondents were adamant that  “there is no  persuasive argument to attribute any significant number of cold cases and missing people to serial killings” and  “ no reason whatsoever to believe that any meaningful proportion of un re solved cases are the result of serial killers” ;  describing efforts to  attribute the recent homicide spike to serial killing as “ludicrous”. Another respondent pointed out that  “ the world is safer now than at any other point in history ”,  but was careful to remind of our use of anecdotal clues which provided much of what we know now about violence. One respondent suggested that there is no “ credible evidence that the number of missing persons that are actually homicides not yet known to police is very large.”  Another called for “an empirically based assessment tool to minimize cognitive biases associated with simplified heuristics based on individual investigators' experience.”"
"79" "Representatives from societies, foundations ,  and centers stated that official statistics regarding  the discordance  are unavailable and that estimates are relied upon to guide knowledge.  One respondent stated that “t here are huge gaps in data gathering which leads to guesstimating the real numbers” and that “wild guesses are dressed up to look meaningful.”   Another  indicated that it is “ far harder today to create a John or Jane Doe” and introduced a measure of skepticism that “a majority of the 40,000 unidentified human remains can be chalked up to serial killers.”   Both reporters, each supervising their paper’s homicide tracking database, were confident that serial murders are the minority exception rather than the norm among homicide cases, each noting that the hallmarks of serial homicide (strangulation, mutilation, dismemberment) are found just as often in interpersonal homicides.  Practitioners  believe that our lack of knowledge bolsters offenders and makes their careers longer. One respondent observed that researchers tend to “rig the numbers” associated with victim thresholds to  facilitate   theories."
"80" "Discussion"
"81" "Due to  perceptions of an epidemic of serial homicides, a debate exists among researchers about whether serial homicide may actually be in a decline.  T his study  u se d  the  CSHOD   and found  that there  have been fewer unresolved serial killing series as well as  a decline in known resolved serial killings.  We  determined that  the past decade contained  almost half the percentage of cases  (13%)  that existed  at the peak of serial homicide in the 1980’s  (27%) . In recent decades, there have been fewer  unresolved serial killing series  with smaller victim counts and shorter spans between first and last  known  kills. The cause of the decline in serial homicide may be  due to  developments in law enforcement techniques, in technology, and increased personal safety measures over time.  Although anyone can engage in serial murder,  mythmaking has fallaciously transformed the concept ( Homant  & Kennedy, 2009;  Jenkins, 2002 )  into one where only   t hose harboring  complex idiosyncratic combinations of emotions, memories, intentions, fantasies,  plans  ( Shanafelt  &  Pino , 2013) ,   and   warped views of  culture ( DeFronzo , 2007;   Wiest , 2016)  can kill serially ."
"82" "In the sample of experts, it was found that t hose supporting the idea that serial homicide is in decline  are  from fields outside the serial homicide mainstream. M ost of the respondents thought it unreasonable to classify any statistically meaningful proportion of missing  persons  cases as homicides, let alone victims of serial homicide.  The contrast in opinions between LEOs and professors warrants further investigation as biased or  uneducated  viewpoints may result in  repeating stereotypes.  As   new discoveries of unresolved series are at the lowest point in recorded history ,  with the number of known unresolved serial homicide series having been halved with each passing decade , the  fear that hundreds of unknown serial killers are trolling for victims  is   unwarranted .  It is unlikely that f urther victimization  will  result from the unknown offenders included in this  study ,  as they undergo   biological changes that restrict their  willingness t o continue their campaigns . The offenders responsible for half of the unresolved series in this query are, in all probability, either dead ( Reid, 2017 ) or retired ( Smith, 2018 ) ,  given that most serial murderers begin their careers  in their thirties  and  were   active for an average span of three years ( Aamodt & Yaksic, 2015 ). Results of  this study   demonstrate d  that   we cannot  attribute  any significant majority of  missing or unidentified persons  to  serial homicide activity."
"83" "Future Research Directions"
"84" "Future research should be less concerned about whether or not the decrease has occurred ,  but rather why the spike  took place   in the 1980s ( Dimond , 2014). The complexity of multiple interacting variables is often too complicated to completely understand, especially given the small  everyday life  choices that send us down paths neither anticipated nor entirely predictable  ( Shanafelt  &  Pino , 2013).   Because  DeLisi ,  Tahja , Drury,  Caropreso , Elbert, &  Heinrichs  (2016) draw a distinction between most homicides being reactive, expressive ,  and impulsive actions and those entailing homicidal ideation or planning and contemplation to complete,  Yaksic et al. (2018)  explore d  whether or not modern day offenders engage in homicidal ideation and simply fail to follow through with their schemes  and  if thinking about committing murder has dissipated along with falling homicide rates.  A true estimate of serial homicide offending will be incomplete unless it incorporates those that intended to murder serially ,  but whose efforts were stalled by arrest, imprisonment ,  or death."
"85" "Limitations"
"86" "Some   of the  potential  limitations  in this study are endemic to homicide research. The intervention of LEOs in the formative years of a serial  murderer’s  career prevent s  longitudinal research on  which traits would have coalesced during the transformative process  of  offender’s   like Christopher  Duntsch  ( Guillen , 2017) or Gannon LeBlanc, aged 23 ( Bienick , 2016).  Fa tigue ( Bialik , 2016)   may have  impacted the current study  as strain induced by reports   about death can be unsettling.  The study of  unresolved homicides  cannot  allow  researchers to analyze known events attributed to tangible offenders .   I t  was not possible to assemble an exhaustive list of known unresolved serial homicide series  because   some  missing persons are never reported to the police  and  those that are ,  can be overlooked as transient   (LePard et al.,  2015) ."
"87" "Findings from the review of the Hall of Justice records may not be  generalizable  as McNamara and Morton (2004) warn that geographic, demographic ,  and cultural issues limit the representativeness of a sample when attempting to project the national percentage of serial homicide victimization.  Many  aspects of the review, such as potential victim-offender  relationships  and if  the unresolved strangulation murders were stranger homicides , were unknown because pertinent  narrative details were unavailable .  One drawback of relying on  the  LEO websites  from  the Hall of Justice  is that the full case list is not always available ( Friedenberger  & Stevens, 2017 ) which   affects the  r eplicability   of this study. The review of these unresolved homicides could be  underpowered since  it  covered only a fraction (10%) of the estimated 230,355 unresolved homicides identified by Stein (2017)  and  it can be  too subjective to be meaningful. Although the review was influenced by two popular concepts in serial homicide research –  strangled   females   – these parameters may have narrowed its scope. The low occurrence of strangulation homicides complements  Schlesinger’s (2001) argument that serial homicide is not increasing gi ven the victimization of women has been steadily decreasing ."
"88" "Conclusion"
"89" "Much of the academic literature on serial homicide focuses on the need for better detection methods  r ather than  the etiology  and  criminogenic   factors that  influence  offender  choices .  T he reasons  for  the decline   force  researchers to acknowledge that serial murderers are people impacted by societal shifts and cultural norms as opposed to monsters mindlessly trolling and seething.  The construct of the  infallible, adaptable ,  and successful serial killer  has allowed  LEOs to attribute their  failures  in resolving homicides to being outmatched by  superior  criminals , an excuse unsupported and challenged by the observed decline."
"90" "Researchers must break away from their areas of expertise to p rovid e  the decline with ample attention and consideration ( Shanafelt  &  Pino , 2013).  DeLisi  (2015) holds researchers accountable for limiting  scholarly thought   related to  serial murder  by  shunning it as an aberration   and  relegating its study to true crime authors and expert practitioners  that  f ield questions  about  the offender’s accomplishments corresponding to body counts or methods of deaths . Researchers rarely effect change   on real world circumstances ,  frustrated  that   the decline in serial homicide has happened outside of  their  efforts  to orchestrate it. Both tracks  contribut e  to disbelief in the phenomenon  of the decline ."
"91" "The current research  attempts to  highlight perceptions within circles and subcategories of experts and  represent   the presence of serial murderers in modern society  where they  remain  a  threat to the public ( Crimaldi , 2017) . T hey are not , however,  waiting to reemerge and capitalize on a  criminal justice system  in disarray .  T he results of the current study   reveal  that  there has been a decline in serial homicide . This  may surprise  those  w ith a fascination with violence .  Although some warn of a  future  increase in serial homicide  ( Miller,   2018 ) ,  w e  are optimistic  that  the landscape  of  prior decades has  been  permanently transformed  through  technology,  s hifts in  o ffending  b ehavior , p roactive  l aw  e nforcement  a ction , and i ncreased  v igilance of  s ociety ."

"369" "Professor"
"370" "Any serious researcher would need a good deal of evidence before leaping to the dramatic conclusion that significant numbers of missing persons are in fact victims of serial killers. This is especially so given the inflammatory nature of the allegation. I would be very careful before scaring the heck out of the public with something like this. "
"371" "Professor"
"372" "Clearance rate issues reflect more gang and/or stranger violence, and ongoing interpersonal conflicts, an ice dam of problematic personalities in executive police roles. Linkage blindness leads to a number (not sure about hundreds) of serials going unnoticed."
"373" "Professor"
"374" "The population of officially “missing persons” is for obvious reasons not included in cold case files, but an unknown percentage of them are homicide victims. It is reasonable to assume that a higher percentage of serial killer victims are “missing” than those for other types of killings. Correcting for this omission of cases would be tricky to say the least, but a formula could be developed."
"375" "Professor"
"376" "Violence on the whole is decreasing, and that includes homicide and, I strongly suspect, serial homicide but context is important. Detection methods and forensic evidence, data availability and analytical capacity/ability are all contributing to the decline directly or indirectly, but also contributing to greater awareness (the general public, those who investigate- so it doesn't surprise me that law enforcement officials think serial killing is on the rise. Did they even really look for it in the past? If not, then they would have thought it had an extremely low prevalence. Now that they spend loads on software and personnel - they see more of the problem. That doesn't mean  its  on the rise, just that they're more aware). What I think leads us to believe that violence is rising is the ubiquity of information at short notice. So I believe that there is an inverse relationship between the actual numbers and awareness of violence, the latter skewing our perception of the actual rates. This increased awareness has triggered popular media treatment, which has a strong tendency to conflate, dramatize and in turn, again, skew our perception. I am acutely aware of how the media can edit out nuanced comments to make for greater drama. In more egregious cases, the experts submit, subconsciously or otherwise, to the pressure to give the producers a better quip or quote. Those who say that the numbers are rising are, like the contrarians like me, speculating. Nobody has the full picture and so we’re all left making inferences based on limited, complex data.  Which is the case of speculation about whether or not serial murderers are responsible for a large (or small, or minute) proportion of missing persons cases.  A lot of people go missing voluntarily or for a whole raft of reasons, so I would guess that the answer is “no”, but how can I or anyone know this? We cannot know the extent of serial murder. In some major cities in the US, the resolution rate of homicides is pretty low and when we consider that this only counts cases where there is good evidence of a homicide (as opposed to a disappearance, that might be the result of homicide). Serial murder has a different sort of slant. Many killings are related to organized crime, criminal gangs and  narco  trafficking and so a serial murderer takes a different form than the more popularized type in industrialized nations. Is a gang member who, over the course of his 'career', kills four people in five years are they a serial killer? Finally, I would say that estimations based on MO can’t be reliable, because there is so much overlap between serial murderers and non-serial murderers. Only in a small context can one use this with what might approximate reliability, but again, this is unknown until you catch your killer and can safely assume that the crimes are linked by triangulated data. One is using indirect evidence of multiple things to try and make an inference about a single cause/circumstance. Not reliable."
"377" "Professor"
"378" "There are some connections that have been made between serial killing and prostitution (now better understood as sex trafficking in many cases) but we don't see situations where exploiters/pimps kill the women they have under their control.  Usually it is a buyer that is involved in killing a trafficking victim who is being victimized by an exploiter. I don't see much evidence of the offender's utilization of trafficking victims as a potential reason for the decline in the data I have seen."
"379" "Professor"
"380" "The Hall of Justice data appears to be semi-longitudinal data. You wouldn’t need sophisticated statistical models to estimate the rate of serial murderers because of the reliability and validity of official homicide data. Because homicide statistics are so good your best estimation then would rely of your inclusion criteria for identifying serial murderers - in this case the M.O. (i.e., strangulation and asphyxiation) and the gender of the victim. You would of course have to analyze these offenders amongst all other types of homicide data - cold case and otherwise. From a methodological perspective I think your first line of inquiry is your best. It is important to note that the 1.3% of strangulation murders you identified only includes cold cases and not all homicides in the United States. In order to get an overall estimation you would have to also include the number of serial murders identified in cleared cases as well. While serial murderers often kill by strangulation or asphyxiation some kill using other methods such as blunt weapons, knives, or firearms. Consequently, you may be including some offenders who are not serial killers and excluding other serial murderers who use a different method(s) of killing. You would also only be identifying serial killers who kill females, thereby excluding serial murderers with male or male/female victims. With that said, while your estimation is higher than other reported rates yours is empirically based and not completely out of range which to me suggests you may be on the right track. While it would be excessively rare, it is possible that one serial murderer could be responsible for all of your cases. This in turn would drastically, affect the percentage of active serial murderers."

"382" "Indeed, serial murder has not declined and in the past 7 years has slightly increased in the US. This, in part, is due to the changing of the number of murders required to qualify one as a serial killer. In fact, the race of serial killers is changing as well. Over the past 7 years over 50% of all American serial killers  are  Black. Of course, the public perception is that they are predominately White but in American society poor blacks killing poor blacks does not attract the media. The numbers are not declining, they are changing."
"383" "Professor"
"384" "Clearance rates have been going down for a long time, as gang- and drug-type killings became more predominant and urban settings in which cooperation with authorities is eschewed became more prevalent. A few jurisdictions have gotten clearance rates very high through increased investigative sophistication and community outreach, suggesting that failures elsewhere are not due to anything exotic like serial killings; there’s no reason that would say that we should blame serial killers for any particular proportion of missing person cases. I can’t think of any persuasive argument to attribute what we know to be true – there are a lot of cold cases and missing people – to serial killings. There’s no reason whatsoever to believe that any meaningful proportion of unsolved cases are the result of serial killers. I’m aware of the highway  killers  project, but last I checked that involved some hundreds of (potential) victims and offenders – nothing like “thousands” of killers. The recent homicide spike in some cities is driven by a heightening of ordinary and well-understood urban dynamics.  It’s ludicrous to attribute that to serial killing."
"385" "Professor"
"386" "Get access to a database with missing person reports, where you have some level of definite proof of \"what happened\". Then I'd look at how those categories differ from each other: do an initial cross-tabulation to see what kind of variables differ the most. Use that \"key\" to predict the status of the missing persons in your data. We used logistic regression to do this, but Bayesian probability would probably outperform the regression. With this methodology you'd have an empirically based assessment tool, and would minimize cognitive biases associated with simplified heuristics based on individual investigators' experience."
"387" "Professor"
"388" "Researchers rely on anecdotal clues rather than statistical analysis. I liked your various hypotheses on the decline of serial killing. My first inclination would be to connect it to the overall crime decline of the past 25 years (which of course we don’t really understand either). More and smarter policing, greater public awareness of forensics, greater caution, particularly on the part of women (my generation used to hitchhike with abandon in the 1970s), increased incarceration, and perhaps a decline of the 1960s if-it-feels-good-do-it ethos may all play a role."
"389" "Professor"
"390" "We hadn't been counting a whole group of people--missing persons who had fallen victim to serial killers and especially the “missing missing” whose estimates range from 280 to 1,800 a year. We are better now than ever at detecting serial homicides so our number of active unsolved serial killings at any time has increased. Our detection of serial murder has improved, so lots of cases that would have never been noticed in decades past are on our radar. Serial murder is on the decline for all groups and nowhere near the levels  we \"knew \" about in the 1980s. How many undetected medical murderers are there in our hospitals?"
"391" "Professor"
"392" "As to whether serial killers are responsible for a large proportion of missing person cases - my initial response simply based on my experience would be to say no.  I have found the typologies presented by Walter and Keppel (power assertive, power reassurance, anger retaliatory, and anger excitation) to be empirically supported, and with that being  said,  serial killers in my experience typically fall into the two anger categories, where murder is premeditated.  Generally with these categories, and in particular with anger retaliatory cases, victims of these types of killers will undoubtedly share some characteristic, whether it  be  physical resemblance to one another, profession, etc.  If we are not seeing this type of trend across missing person cases, I would say that the majority of missing person cases  are  not a result of a serial offender. Most missing person cases, particularly for juveniles, are a result of a runaway, family, or acquaintance abduction.  Stranger abductions and homicides are most rare (approx. 115 annually). What I have found from my experience is that cases go cold for a few reasons: 1) the victim is devalued by society and/or lives a high risk lifestyle and law enforcement does not respond with the same enthusiasm as they might if the victim was middle-upper class (which is why serial offenders target these individuals), 2) the law enforcement agency responding is underfunded and understaffed to respond to the vast amount of homicides,  and 3) the detectives form tunnel vision and the real perpetrator is missed. One comment in particular stuck out to me from a law enforcement  official, that  criminals are merely getting smarter and therefore we're not finding the bodies.  While that may be partially true, when you examine the psychopathology of a serial killer, they are driven by insatiable compulsion.  While there may be intricate planning involved, they are driven by unconscious impulses they cannot control; they would not care whether the bodies are found or not, and further, many of them demand credit for their actions."
"393" "Professor"
"394" "I’ve seen researchers use interesting techniques to try to gauge the true statistical rate of under reported crimes. Teams of dedicated researchers, investigative journalists, law enforcement, and documentarians should work together to solve unsolved serial cases, like what was done in the documentary. It’s unlikely that anything like that would ever happen but it’s needed."
"395" "Professor"
"396" "While the clearance rate has been low the number of unsolved known homicides continues to rise. The best estimate is 240,000 since 1980. As for the missing persons being homicides that are not known to police -- anything is possible but there is no credible evidence that the number is very large."
"397" "Professor"
"398" "What is the rate per 100,000 persons of reported serial homicides in the U.S.? My impression, formed at a meeting at the FBI academy in the 1990s, is that known serial killers are very rare, and that the rate of serial homicides is very low--well below 1 per 100,000. I know it is probably interesting to be studying exotic forms of murder, but the real problem is the all too frequent murders of young men by other young men."
"399" "Law Enforcement"
"400" "FBI (ret.)"
"401" "I have been \"preaching\" about the need for VICAP and its use by American police departments to scores of audiences around the country since my departure from the FBI in 1995. I'd speculate that the #'s submitted to VICAP are statistically \"insignificant\" compared to reality. The sheer numbers of the annual amount of new unsolved homicides, missing persons and unidentified bodies are startling but we don't have a record keeping system accurately monitoring those three categories to determine their respective final status at the end of each year in which they were reported."
"402" "Law Enforcement"
"403" "FBI (ret.)"
"404" "Here in the US law enforcement unfortunately we don't have the time or the tools to work complex investigations. I don't believe that serial murder is in a decline at all. VICAP is still a voluntary program and if it will not be the very effective in linking cases."
"405" "Law Enforcement"
"406" "FBI (ret.)"
"407" "I would invite anyone who believes that serial killing has declined to take a look at the FBI's Highway Serial Killer Initiative. So far 10 offenders responsible for 30 victims have been arrested.  There are still over 500 unsolved cases out there. Not much of a decline in my humble opinion. Offenders are constantly evolving faster than law enforcement agencies that are plagued with budget cuts, bogged down with administrative BS and overburdened with growing caseloads and shrinking man- and woman-power. As the results from the Highway SKI are being analyzed and arrests are made, I expect the numbers to go up."
"408" "Law Enforcement"
"409" "The only reason we are not hearing about serial murder as often is due to the killers being more cautious and learning from the mistakes of others. The missing people are still missing and their bodies may never be found due to the extra precaution the serial killers are taking now.  They can’t stop their impulses and compulsions to  capture,  abuse and kill innocent victims, thus they are just hiding the corpses better and the cops aren’t finding them. I do not think they have stopped by any means."
"410" "Law Enforcement"
"411" "I'm not sure how you can legitimately estimate something like that. The HSKI murders go back over 30 years. I would say that 450 suspects is a high number. I think that it would be closer to 200. I think using their formula for estimating suspects could inflate the number significantly. I can see how that would certainly suggest an increase in serial killers. I think the numbers have actually decreased since the days of Ted Bundy. It could be more potential serial killers are being caught after one murder due to advances in technology and other factors."
"412" "Law Enforcement"
"413" "Analyst"
"414" "I believe the awareness and reporting is better so the numbers are probably better. In regards to HSKI, offenders and victims are fairly consistent across time as the project looks back to the 1980s. If there is an increase I don’t think it is a lot and can most likely be attributed to media exposure."
"415" "Law Enforcement"
"416" "I started looking at unsolved female homicides and missing females in my area a few weeks ago.  So far the parameters that I’m using are: unsolved female homicide victims age 14-40; missing females; known or believed to be involved in prostitution; 1970-present; King, Pierce, Snohomish, Lewis, Thurston and Cowlitz Counties. I got a list based on these criteria from the Washington State Attorney General’s Office, Homicide Investigation and Tracking System Unit (HITS).  After weeding out the solved cases, it looks like we have about 80 cases that meet the criteria."
"417" "Practitioner"
"418" "Bottom line is that I just don’t know. But, I did look carefully at the list of databases you sent –– “Known Unresolved Series Counts and Chart.” The ones I know well and use regularly are the cold cases for the Boulder Police Department and the cold cases for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Neither  are  listing all existing cases. Some of those unlisted cases could be serial homicides. But how do you compare whether or not serial homicide is in decline if the data for both the past and present is not all-inclusive? At the same time, some agencies today are doing a better job of reporting, while other agencies are not. For instance, Arizona has a lot of missing persons. But, that doesn’t mean there are more missing persons there. It just means that law enforcement in Arizona is doing a better job of reporting them. As to numbers of missing and unidentified, there’s a recent Fact Sheet from  NamUs  with these statistics: Nationwide: 4,400 unidentified remains per year (40,000 continue to go unidentified) Nationwide: As many as 85,000 active missing person cases at any one time. I just don’t see how anyone can answer your question without accurate information –– from both past and present –– to back it up   "
"419" "Practitioner"
"420" "Availability of data sources has changed so drastically over time that we cannot ignore the impact that may have on these numbers. I am struck by how the victim types have not really changed over the years. I would also think about what the decline in unsolved serial murders means in comparison to the solved series.  If detection is better and law enforcement is able to catch offenders more quickly and better able to identify offenders using technology, then you would expect the number of solved series to see an increase (or even stopping  them  before the numbers rise and they are categorized as serial).  Assuming the behaviors of potential serial killers are not changing drastically over time, we would expect to see more solved series than unsolved series. The data could be under-inclusive.  I would start to question if the data are missing serial killers. I would have expected the numbers to increase over time, due to the ability to link across jurisdictions. Perhaps in the past, we were unable to link them and therefore identify the connections. If the decline is true, it would indicate there is a change in society. What is different?  Technological advances/data sharing improvements/social media? Electronic communication is much easier to track than ever before. What does this change about how serial murderers behave?  Are they more likely to be caught in a shorter period of time?  Many of the more recent series are shorter in length than in previous decades. With the explosive nature of access through the internet, I wonder if there are some potential serial killers who do not act on their impulses. Pornography and violence is very accessible, along with fantasy worlds, avatars, role playing options that simply did not exist so readily 25 years ago."
"421" "Practitioner"
"422" "I kept looking for any evidence that serial killing has actually declined, but all I could find was the \"threshold\" bump to four victims  minimum, instead of three, and even with that rigging of the numbers, no statistics overall."
"423" "Practitioner"
"424" "I have found the vast majority of no-body murder cases to not be the work of serial killers. Over 50% of the cases involve a domestic relationship between the defendant and the suspect. I deal only with closed cases, not the thousands of missing  persons  cases that have never been solved. It is possible that some/many/most of these cases are the work of serial killers which would be more difficult to solve because the obvious suspect in most no-body cases, like most murder cases, are people known to the victim."
"425" "Practitioner"
"426" "I don't know how your statistical specificity can begin to align with what I believe is reality, but Bundy, Ridgeway, Bianchi and Williams are probably responsible for a high percentage of missing persons/cold cases. With crime stats we don't know what we don't know, which makes the careers of lust killers easier and longer."
"427" "Vidocq  Society"
"428" "The estimation of cold cases in the United States from 1980-2014 is 233,000. There are huge gaps in data gathering which leads to guesstimating the real numbers. Data gathering systems are grossly inadequate; right questions are not asked or explored; VICAP and VICLAS wrongly rely on MO and do not account for changing motives; sexual killers will deviate to eliminate other victims; killers of two victims are not adequately counted; unknown error rate by medical examiners determining suicide – could be homicides; wild guesses are dressed up to look meaningful."
"429" "Vidocq  Society"
"430" "There is no straightforward marker (such as cause of death, type of victim, means of body disposal, etc.) that can reliably classify a homicide as being due to a serial killer. There does not seem to be any reliable way of estimating how many of these homicides in the Hall of Justice database  are actually serial killings . Many of these deaths could instead be singleton sexual murders or personal cause homicides. As serial murder is rare, it could be that the great majority of your cases are not due to serial killers. When you’re dealing with unresolved cases, and limited background information, there would be no way to tell. Strangulation may not be distinctively associated with serial killing."
"431" "Center"
"432" "Our organization [National Center for Missing & Exploited Children] does not maintain these types of statistics."
"433" "NamUS"
"434" "UCR does not gather information on serial killers; offender’s knowledge of jurisdictional issues makes linking cases more difficult; no database for homicides equivalent to  NamUs ; investigators are overburdened with no time for proper training. Serial killers choose trucking because it provides access to victims. The entropy of any isolated system always increases as a function of time. Serial murder will increase. You must have the right tools and instruments in place to accurately measure the level and rate of increase occurring at any given time."
"435" "NamUS"
"436" "Hard to say about trends as we still work to uncover the cases from the past. That being said - it is far harder today to create a John or Jane Doe. Not so easy to strip them of their ID by removing a few items or disfiguring the body. I do not believe that a majority of our unidentified can be chalked up to serial killers. Often even before an ID is made there are serious looks at similar cases in seeking a pattern. After the ID often the theory was all for not when we learn about other logical suspects."
"437" "Reporter"
"438" "We don’t have a way to track serial homicides programmatically as part of our database. Serial cases are an exception not the norm."
"439" "Reporter"
"440" "As for the presumed increase or decrease in serial killings - my sample size is small but I have not found any evidence of serial killers running rampant. The dismemberment cases appear to be unrelated, at least right now. "
