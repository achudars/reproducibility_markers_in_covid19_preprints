BELIEF STATES IN CRIMINAL LAW
JAMES A. MACLEOD*
Belief-state ascription—determining what someone “knew,” “believed,”
was “aware of,” etc.—is central to many areas of law. In criminal law, the
distinction between knowledge and recklessness, and the use of broad jury
instructions concerning other belief states, presupposes a common and
stable understanding of what those belief-state terms mean. But a wealth of
empirical work at the intersection of philosophy and psychology—falling
under the banner of “Experimental Epistemology”—reveals how
laypeople’s understandings of mens rea concepts differ systematically from
what scholars, courts, and perhaps legislators, have assumed.
As implemented, mens rea concepts are much more context-dependent
and normatively evaluative than the conventional wisdom suggests, even
assuming that jurors are following jury instructions to the letter. As a
result, there is less difference between knowledge and recklessness than is
typically assumed; jurors consistently “over”-ascribe knowledge to
criminal defendants; and concepts like “belief,” “awareness,” and
“conscious disregard” mean different things in different contexts, resulting
in mens rea findings systematically responsive to aspects of the case
traditionally considered irrelevant to the meaning of those terms.
This Article provides the first systematic account of the factors driving
jurors’ ascriptions of the specific belief states criminal law invokes. After
surveying mens rea jury instructions, introducing the Experimental
Epistemology literature to the legal literature on mens rea, and examining
the implications of that literature for criminal law, this Article considers
ways to begin bridging the surprisingly large gap between mens rea theory
and practice.

I. Introduction
The law often requires fact-finders to use circumstantial evidence to
determine another’s mental state. These mental states fall into two basic
categories: desire states (such as intent, purpose, and indifference) and
belief states (such as knowledge, belief, and ignorance).1 Legal scholarship
1. See Kenneth W. Simons, Rethinking Mental States, 72 B.U. L. REV. 463, 476 (1992)
[hereinafter Simons, Rethinking]. The “desire states” label is a bit of a misnomer: one can
intend to do something without desiring to do it, for example, as happens when one is forced
to choose between courses of action one dislikes. Still, the label is prevalent in the legal
literature and suffices for present purposes.

has examined how laypeople ascribe desire states,2 but it has largely
ignored how fact-finders ascribe belief states. This gap in the legal literature
is surprising given the central role belief-state ascription plays in factfinding throughout the law.
Consider substantive criminal law. A defendant’s guilt or innocence,
along with his degree of punishment, frequently turns on his belief state—
whether he was “aware” of something, “believed” something, “consciously
disregarded” something, “knew” something, etc. The definitions of all four
of the Model Penal Code’s (MPC) mens rea categories—purpose,
knowledge, recklessness, and negligence—explicitly invoke the defendant’s
belief state, as do hundreds of provisions throughout federal and state
criminal codes.3 And a defendant’s punishment differs significantly
depending on whether, for example, the defendant was “aware” of a risk
(and hence was reckless, rather than negligent),4 or whether the defendant

was not merely “aware” of a risk but actually “knew” that a bad outcome
would result from his action.5
Despite the central role these and other belief-state terms play in law,6 a
fundamental question remains unanswered: what do they mean? More
specifically, when the criminal law asks jurors to determine whether a
defendant “knew” something, “believed” something, “consciously
disregarded” something, etc., and when jurors faithfully implement the
instructions they are given, what functional understanding of those beliefstate terms are they employing?
This Article is the first sustained attempt at answering that question.
Previous accounts of modern mens rea concepts have too often glossed over
it, relying on supposedly commonly shared intuitions about the meaning of
the terms at issue,7 philosophical analyses of the relevant terms,8 or
about the justifiability of penal liability for negligence has not made greater efforts to
understand the nature of awareness.”).
5. See infra notes 168-71 and accompanying text.
6. Belief states are central to many more issues, in criminal law and elsewhere, than
are apparent at first glance. For example, sticking with criminal law, even where the
pertinent statute calls for desire-state ascription and does not explicitly call for belief-state
ascription, courts sometimes explicitly instruct that a belief state satisfies the desire-state
requirement—e.g., if the jury finds that the defendant possessed knowledge that his action
would cause a given outcome, this may suffice for a finding that the defendant intentionally
caused that outcome. See, e.g., Rosemond v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1240, 1248-49 (2014).
And even where courts do not so instruct, recent empirical research indicates that a jury’s
intentionality ascription will likely track its knowledge ascription. In other words, with or
without an instruction from the court, the jury will typically deem knowledge sufficient for
intent. See Mueller, supra note 2, at 860; infra Section III.A.1. Nor does belief-state
ascription merely influence ascription of other mental states. The conclusions that factfinders make about a person’s belief state sometimes also impact fact-finders’ determination
of an act or omission’s degree of causal influence—i.e., degree to which the act or omission
caused a particular outcome—an attribute traditionally thought not to implicate mental state
ascription. See Christopher Hitchcock & Joshua Knobe, Cause and Norm, 106 J. PHIL. 587,
602-05 (2009); Nadler & McDonnell, supra note 2, at 287; Briar Helen Moir, Judgments in
Causal Chains: The Impact of Positive and Negative Motives and Outcomes on Lay
Attributions (2014) (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Victoria University of Wellington),
http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/3277/thesis. pdf?sequence=2
(reviewing the literature). In sum, a growing body of legal doctrine and empirical literature
places belief states at the center of many more legal issues than had previously seemed to be
the case.

appellate case law, statutory structure, official code commentaries, and
other sources to which jurors are not privy.9 In contrast, this Article’s
method is to examine actual mens rea jury instructions, and then, to the
extent they leave relevant issues ambiguous, to draw on empirical research
concerning how laypeople are likely to resolve those ambiguities.10
Culpability, 1 BUFF. CRIM. L. REV. 501, 529 (1998) (arguing that an expert shooter A, who
aims for B and is justified in believing he has shot and killed B, but who, it turns out,

would say” that he does not know that he has killed someone); Kenneth W. Simons, Should

10. The previous failure to ask this sort of question about jurors is puzzling. After all,

The results are surprising. This Article uncovers important divergences
between, on the one hand, what courts, commentators, and code drafters
think belief-state terms do and should mean, and, on the other hand, what
jurors are told that they mean. The four main divergences can be
summarized as follows.11 First, the distinction between knowledge and
recklessness, as defined in popular jury instructions and applied in practice,
is nearly nonexistent. As a result, jurors likely “over”-ascribe knowledge to
criminal defendants, and even where they do not, significant sentencing
interpretation). Granted, jurors, unlike judges, leave no written explanation of their decisionmaking. But much of the judicial decision-making literature adopts an “external” perspective
that seeks to explain judicial decision-making without recourse to the explanations judges
themselves give. See Charles L. Barzun, Inside-Out: Beyond the Internal/External
Distinction in Legal Scholarship, 101 VA. L. REV. 1203, 1235-36 (2015). For speculation as
to some reasons for the previous neglect, see infra Section IV.E.
11. Before summarizing them, it may help to provide a more concrete example of the
sorts of ambiguities that pervade current mens rea jury instructions. Consider the concept of
“knowledge” at work in a recent Supreme Court case, Rosemond v. United States, 134 S. Ct.
1240 (2014). Rosemond’s partner brought a gun to a marijuana deal Rosemond helped
orchestrate. Id. at 1243. At Rosemond’s trial for aiding and abetting an armed drug deal, the
prosecution needed to prove that Rosemond “knew” in advance that his partner would show
up armed, and that Rosemond “knowingly” participated in an armed drug deal. Id. at 1244,
1250. Rosemond alleged he did not know his partner would be armed. Id. at 1246. (The
aiding and abetting instructions in Rosemond, like many federal instructions, did not define
knowledge, see Jury Instructions at 46, United States v. Rosemond, No. 2:07-CR-886 (D.
Utah 2011); infra Section II.B, but even MPC-based definitions of knowledge leave open the
ambiguities highlighted below, see infra Section II.A.)
What might it mean to find that Rosemond “knew” that P, where “P” means “my partner
will be armed”? First, and least controversially, for Rosemond to have “known” that P, P
must have turned out to be true—i.e., Rosemond’s partner must actually bring a gun.
Second, it seems likely that Rosemond must have believed that P. But what sort of belief, if
any, was necessary? Must Rosemond have had an “occurrent” belief (i.e., conscious
consideration of P at the relevant time), or instead merely a “dispositional” belief (i.e., some
sort of latent acknowledgment that P, such that Rosemond, if asked at the relevant time,
would have agreed that P even though he hadn’t been thinking about it)? And would it
suffice for Rosemond to have in some sense intellectually acknowledged that P but yet act as
if “deep down” he believed or accepted Not-P, perhaps due to “wishful thinking” or some
other conative thought process? Third, Rosemond might have to have some higher degree of
subjective certainty about P than the mere belief that P is more likely true than Not-P. If so,
how much certainty must he have? Eighty percent? Ninety percent? Finally, a few
overarching questions: does the degree of morality or immorality of the actor’s P-relevant
action, in Rosemond’s case or in other cases, impact the type of belief that P, or the degree
of certainty that P, that suffices for knowledge that P? And can the requisite type of belief or
degree of certainty depend on pragmatic features of the agent’s situation—for instance, how
much time Rosemond had available to form an opinion about P? For answers to these
questions, see infra Section III.B.

disparities hinge on an unreliable distinction. Second, the legal concept of
“willful ignorance” is often a form of knowledge. Where it is not, the two
are distinguishable largely because of a difference in the actor’s practical
circumstances, rather than a difference in the actor’s mental state. Third,
important concepts like “belief,” “awareness,” and “conscious disregard”
signify different kinds of mental states in different circumstances. As a
result, jurors’ belief-state ascriptions systematically track features of the
case typically thought irrelevant to mental-state determination, ultimately
leading to mistaken convictions and acquittals. Fourth, and more generally,
modern mens rea terms are more context-dependent and evaluative than is
typically thought. This calls into question the conventional wisdom that
modern criminal codes like the MPC employ less evaluative, and more
purely descriptive, mens rea concepts than did the common law. It also has
important implications for various normative proposals premised on that
conventional wisdom.
The Article proceeds as follows. Part II addresses how MPC and nonMPC jurisdictions use and define belief state terms such as “knowledge,”
“belief,” “conscious disregard,” and “failure to perceive.” It focuses on
actual belief-state jury instructions, as well as commentary from scholars,
courts, and code drafters concerning the meaning of those belief-state
terms. It shows that jury instructions provide little explanation of belief
states, leaving a large role for jurors’ pre-existing understandings of the
terms in question. Jurors interpret ambiguous directions in a way that
coincides with their natural language-based understanding of the terms at
issue. What that understanding is, and how it is employed in response to
circumstantial evidence of mental state, is an empirical question.
Part III draws on recent empirical research at the intersection of
philosophy and psychology—falling under the banner of “Experimental
Epistemology”—to provide a descriptive account of how laypeople
interpret and ascribe “belief,” “knowledge,” and related concepts. This
literature sheds light on how laypeople resolve the sorts of ambiguities
noted in the previous Part’s discussion of common jury instructions. The
resulting picture of the various mens rea terms differs in important respects
from conventional legal and philosophical accounts of what those terms
mean.
Part IV examines the implications of the empirical research for the
criminal law’s treatment of belief states. It shows that several assumptions
underlying courts’, commentators’, and perhaps legislatures’ mens rea
analyses are flawed, resulting in misguided statutory schemes, misleading
jury instructions, and unintended effects on case outcomes. For each

[Vol. 68:497

divergence between mens rea theory and practice this Part highlights, it also
explains why the divergence matters and discusses potential ways to
address it. After discussing the four main divergences listed above, Section
IV.E considers several objections to the Article’s focus on jury instructions.
It argues that these objections are unwarranted, and that scholarly scrutiny
of mens rea jury instructions is particularly important because current
institutional mechanisms are ill-designed to flag, let alone remedy,
systematically problematic mens rea instructions.
Part V concludes.
II. Belief States in Criminal Law
This Part examines what jurors are told about the legal definitions of
belief states, as well as how legal scholars, legislators, model code drafters,
and judges describe and interpret various belief-state terms. It first
addresses instructions in MPC jurisdictions and then more briefly examines
federal instructions as a particularly important example of non-MPC mens
rea analysis.
A. The Model Penal Code
The MPC employs four main mens rea categories, listed here in order of
decreasing culpability: (1) purposely, (2) knowingly, (3) recklessly, and (4)
negligently.12 Each entails a minimum requisite belief state, and each leaves
open significant questions concerning what constitutes that belief state.
12. MPC § 2.02(2). Each state further up the culpability chain suffices to establish those
lower on the chain. Id. § 2.02(5). The MPC adds a fifth mens rea in the context of homicide,
labeled “extreme indifference.” Id. § 210.2(1)(b). Some specific crimes and affirmative
defenses delineated in the MPC involve yet other mental states including, for example,
“belief.” See, e.g., id. § 3.04(2)(c) (“[A] person employing protective force may estimate the
necessity thereof under the circumstances as he believes them to be when the force is used”);
id. § 3.05(l)(b) (providing that use of force in defense of another person is to be evaluated on
the basis of “the circumstances as the actor believes them to be”); id. § 5.01(l)(c) (defining
the elements of criminal attempt); id. § 223.6(1) (offense of receiving stolen property
requires that one “purposely receives, retains, or disposes of movable property of another
knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it has probably been stolen”); id. § 241.1
(perjury); id. § 3.02(1) (affirmative defense available where actor “believe[d]” conduct was
necessary to avoid greater harm). Non-MPC jurisdictions similarly utilize “belief” as a
mental state distinct from knowledge, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1621(2) (2012) (perjury), and
jurisdictions that typically follow the MPC at times invoke “belief” where the MPC does
not, see, e.g., 27 MD. CODE ANN., Criminal Law § 7-101(b) (LexisNexis 2012) (deception);
TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 31.0(1)(A) (West Supp. 2014) (deception); WASH. REV. CODE
ANN. § 9A.72.110(2) (LexisNexis 2014) (intimidating former witnesses).

BELIEF STATES IN CRIMINAL LAW

Since “purposely” figures less centrally in the MPC,13 I focus on the other
three MPC mental states and leave “purposely” for another day.14
1. Knowingly
MPC-based jury instructions concerning knowledge typically provide
several definitions. Knowledge of an inculpatory proposition, or knowledge
that “P,”15 is defined as (1) “awareness” that P, or (2) “awareness that it is
practically certain” that P, or (3) “awareness” of a “high probability” that P,
coupled with a lack of “actual belie[f]” that Not-P.16 Virtually all MPCbased knowledge instructions contain both definitions (1) and (2), and
many include definition (3), presenting all three definitions as nonexclusive
alternative bases for finding that the defendant acted knowingly.17 These
definitions contain two central ambiguities, addressed below.

13. Simons, Rethinking, supra note 1, at 470-71 (“[T]he concept of purpose is
surprisingly unimportant: although the [MPC] distinguishes between purpose and knowledge
in the definitional section, it only rarely distinguishes between them in the sections
specifying requirements for individual offenses.”).
14. To be sure, purpose does entail a particular belief state, both as a conceptual matter
and as a matter of legal definition under the MPC. See LARRY ALEXANDER & KIMBERLY
KESSLER FERZAN, CRIME AND CULPABILITY: A THEORY OF CRIMINAL LAW 35 (2009) (“[I]n
order to act with criminal purpose, the actor must believe that his conduct increases the risk
of harm.”); MPC §§ 2.02(a)(ii) (to act “purposely” with respect to an attendant circumstance
element, the defendant must be “aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes
or hopes that they exist”); id. § 2.02 cmt., at 229-41 (“[T]he Code draws a narrow distinction
between acting purposely and knowingly . . . . Knowledge that the requisite external
circumstances exist is a common element in both conceptions.”). That said, and somewhat
mysteriously, the MPC’s definition of purpose as to a result element does not affirmatively
require that the defendant possess any type of belief that the action at issue would increase
the result’s probability. See id. § 2.02(2)(a)(i).
15. Throughout this Article, “P” will represent an inculpatory proposition, and “Not-P”
will represent its opposite. So, for example, if “P” represents the proposition, “my partner
will be armed,” “Not-P” represents the proposition, “my partner will not be armed.”
16. See Simons, Should the Model, supra note 7, at 182 n.9 (noting that “the Code's
definition of knowledge as to a circumstance must be derived from two sources: the basic
definition, ‘aware that such circumstances exist,’ in § 2.02(2)(b)(i); and ‘aware of a high
probability of its existence,’ in § 2.02(7),” and that “[t]he latter phrase presumably controls
the former, since it is a weaker requirement.”).
17. See Robbins, supra note 8, at 226 n.3 (“Although the Code states that this provision
is designed to combat the problem of deliberate ignorance, this statement is contained only
in a comment. . . . Section 2.02(7), which contains the definition, does not place this
restriction on its use.”) (citation omitted); United States v. Jewell, 532 F.2d 697, 700 (9th
Cir. 1976) (en banc) (reasoning, in the context of willful ignorance, that “[t]o act
‘knowingly’ . . . is not necessarily to act only with positive knowledge, but also to act with

One ambiguity concerns what constitutes “awareness” and “actual
belief.” To be “aware” that P, or to “actually believe” that P, must one be
consciously considering P at the relevant time (sometimes called an
“occurrent” belief state18), or could one instead merely be disposed to
endorse P if asked, even if one is not consciously considering P at the
relevant time (a “dispositional” belief state19)? Furthermore, must one have
some sort of internal conviction or acceptance of P “deep down,” or could
one instead merely intellectually acknowledge that P, without any attendant
emotion or conation?20 Neither the MPC’s drafters nor criminal law
scholars have provided much in the way of analysis, leading Professor
Douglas Husak to describe as “scandalous” the fact that scholars have “not
made greater efforts to understand the nature of awareness,” a “pivotal
topic” that is “radically under-theorized.”21
Professor Husak begins his own analysis of awareness in the context of
negligence and recklessness with a “crucial” observation: “awareness (or
belief) need not be occurrent.”22 In other words, one can be “aware” that P
or “actually believe” that P, in the legally relevant sense, even if one is not
consciously considering P at present—so long as one has the right sort of
“disposition” toward P such that one would acknowledge its truth if asked
about it under normal conditions. Additionally, commentators construe
awareness and belief as not requiring any conation or internal conviction.23

result in another’s death. For a more traditional interpretation of “depraved heart” and
“extreme indifference” homicide, see Kenneth W. Simons, Statistical Knowledge

That is, the relevant inquiry in all cases concerning criminal knowledge is
into the defendant’s cognitive disposition—his or her intellectual
acknowledgment that P.
Another ambiguity concerns the degree of confidence one must have in
the truth of P in order to be “practically certain” that P or to be aware of its
“high probability.”24 Commentators agree on two parts of an admittedly
incomplete answer. First, the answer is not “it depends on the situation.”
Rather, whatever the requisite degree of certainty may be, it is contextually
invariant; to know that P, one needs X amount of certainty that P,
regardless of what P is. Professor Kenneth W. Simons sums up this
consensus view nicely when, in contrasting knowledge with the
predominant view of recklessness, he writes, “[o]f course, knowledge is
indeed an invariant mental state; when it is required, the actor must be
aware of a ‘high probability’ or a ‘practical certainty,’ period, without
regard to any other factors.”25
The second point of agreement among commentators is that, whatever
this certainty level is, it is above 50%, and probably considerably higher
than 50%. It must be at least above 50%, commentators reason, because
knowledge that P entails belief that P and belief that P entails
acknowledgment of P’s being more likely true than not.26 It must be

ambiguities and analysis here provided. See, e.g., TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 6.03(b) (West
1994) (defining knowledge as to a result element as requiring that one be “reasonably
certain” that one will cause the result); see also 720 ILL. COMP. STAT. ANN. § 5/4-5 (West
2014) (defining “knowledge” as conscious awareness of “substantial probability”). Ohio
avoids some of the ambiguities by defining knowledge as awareness that a result or
circumstance is merely “probabl[e].” See 29 OHIO REV. CODE ANN. § 2901.22(B) (Lexis
Nexis 2014).

significantly above 50% because (a) “[o]ne would not normally say that one
knows something unless one feels fairly certain of it in one’s mind,”27 and
(b) the MPC’s distinction between recklessness and knowledge is premised
on there being a significant difference between awareness of a merely
“substantial” probability (recklessness) and awareness of a “high”
probability (knowledge).28 The MPC’s drafters apparently considered
“high” probability to denote something significantly above 50%, as
evidenced by their distinguishing, in the Commentaries, the MPC’s “high
probability” form of knowledge from Ohio’s “more expansive” code, which
allows for satisfaction of the knowledge requirement where a result or
circumstance is merely “probable.”29
2. Recklessly and Negligently
MPC-based jury instructions defining recklessness and negligence use
similar structure and phrasing. One is reckless if one (a) “consciously
disregards” (b) a “substantial and unjustifiable risk,” where (c) “considering
the nature and purpose of the actor’s conduct and the circumstances known
difficult to imagine how one can simultaneously be aware of a high probability that a fact
exists yet believe that it does not exist.”); Husak & Callender, supra note 8, at 51 (stating
that a drug courier aware of a 33% risk that his suitcase contains narcotics could not believe
that there is a “high” probability that his suitcase contains drugs for purposes of MPC §
2.02(7)). But see Global-Tech, 131 S. Ct. at 2073 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“One can

conclude they do not infringe.”).

1987) (“Knowledge and belief are very different mental states; knowledge implies a much
higher degree of certainty.”). Going further still, Professor Robins writes that “criminal
knowledge requires certainty and a corresponding absence of doubt,” so that the MPC’s
definition of knowledge, in allowing for a probability assessment to count as knowledge
despite the fact that probabilities “impl[y] an absence of certainty,” fails to track the concept
of “criminal knowledge.” Robbins, supra note 8, at 222 & n.208.

to him,” such disregard “involves a gross deviation” from reasonable
standards of conduct.30 One is negligent if one (a) “should be aware of” (b)
a “substantial and unjustifiable risk,” where (c) “considering the nature and
purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him,” the actor’s
“failure to perceive” the risk involves a gross deviation from reasonable
standards of conduct.31 This Section notes three sources of ambiguity, and
their resolution by commentators, below.
The first source of ambiguity concerns recklessness’ requirement that the
defendant “consciously disregard” a risk, and negligence’s requirement that
the defendant “fail[] to perceive” a risk.32 Both requirements contain similar
ambiguities to those addressed above with respect to “awareness.” For
starters, does “conscious disregard” or a “failure to perceive” imply an
occurrent state, as opposed to a dispositional one? Scholars are divided.33
And must “conscious disregard” involve some sort of inner conviction, or
does it require merely a cognitive, intellectual acknowledgment that the risk
exists? Scholars seem to construe it as requiring only the latter, though
without explicitly addressing the distinction. Finally, in order to have
“consciously disregard[ed]” a substantial and unjustifiable risk, how certain
must the defendant have been that the risk was substantial and/or
unjustifiable? Scholars appear not to have addressed the issue.34
Second, both recklessness and negligence instructions require
consideration of “the circumstances known to” the defendant.35 Does
“knowledge” in this context mean the same thing it means elsewhere in the
MPC? Some scholars construe the term differently here, treating it as if it

33. Garvey, supra note 21, at 344 n.55 (collecting sources).
34. Scholars differ over the distinct but related question of whether the reckless actor
need recognize both the risk’s substantiality and its unjustifiability, or instead merely one or
the other. See, e.g., Claire Finkelstein, Responsibility for Unintended Consequences, 2 OHIO
ST. J. CRIM. L. 579, 594-95 (2005) (arguing that the reckless actor must be aware of the risk's
substantiality); Joshua Dressler, Does One Mens Rea Fit All?: Thoughts on Alexander's
Unified Conception of Criminal Culpability, 88 CAL. L. REV. 955 (2000) (arguing that the
reckless actor need be aware only of the risk’s unjustifiability); David M. Treiman,
Recklessness and the Model Penal Code, 9 AM. J. CRIM. L. 281, 362 (1981) (arguing that
“the actor need not be aware that the risk is unjustifiable”). The question I raise here is not
what the object of the reckless actor’s awareness must be—e.g., the risk’s substantiality, its
unjustifiability, or both—but rather, what it means to be “aware” of something in the
relevant sense.

means merely “belief.”36 Others argue that here, as elsewhere, knowledge
requires more than mere belief, pointing out that the MPC drafters, in
numerous spots where they intended to invoke mere belief, use the word
“belief” and not “knowledge.”37
Third, both recklessness and negligence instructions depend on whether
the risk at issue was “substantial and unjustifiable.”38 Consider the
“substantial” requirement. How much risk counts as “substantial” risk?
Some scholars treat substantiality as wholly dependent upon
unjustifiability, so that there is no substantiality requirement, only
unjustifiability.39 Other scholars, hesitant to read the substantiality
requirement out of the Code, favor an interpretation according to which a
“substantial” risk is one that surpasses an unspecified but contextually
invariant likelihood threshold—though one that is far below 50%.40 Now
consider the “unjustifiable” requirement. How risky must something be in
order to constitute an “unjustifiable” risk? All agree that the answer is,
roughly, “it depends on the situation”—i.e., on how bad it would be if the
risk came to fruition and on what reasons the actor has for engaging in the
risky activity.41 In other words, the “unjustifiability” requirement for
recklessness and negligence, along with the invocation of a “gross

deviation” from “reasonable” standards of conduct, makes these mentalstate concepts contextually “variant” and normatively “evaluative.” They
are thus unlike knowledge, which is supposed to be contextually “invariant”
and “purely descriptive.”42
B. The Federal Criminal Code
The federal criminal code employs a far greater array of mental state
terms than does the MPC,43 and these terms are typically left undefined in
the statutes in which they are found. Moreover, the same terms are defined
differently depending on which substantive crime is at issue, which federal
circuit one is in, and which judge within a given district is crafting the
jury’s instructions. Nonetheless, a broad overview is possible. It is also
worthwhile: the federal courts are a particularly important example of a
non-MPC jurisdiction, and federal judges possess greater discretion than do
judges in MPC jurisdictions in both (a) defining mental state terms invoked
in statutes, and (b) choosing which mental state terms to employ where the
statute is silent.44

interpretation. See Darryl K. Brown, Federal Mens Rea Interpretation and the Limits of

OKLAHOMA LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 68:497

There are three primary ways federal criminal jury instructions address
the concept of knowledge.45 First, some instructions leave undefined what it
means to “know” that P. For example, jury instructions in the Eighth Circuit
tend not to define the term, since, according to the Eighth Circuit Court of
Appeals, its meaning is “a matter of common knowledge.”46 Even outside
the Eighth Circuit the term is often undefined,47 especially, though certainly
not exclusively, where it is invoked indirectly, as part of the definition of
another mens rea term such as “intentionally” or “willfully.”48 Second,
many federal instructions employ the MPC’s formulation of knowledge,
defining it as “awareness of a high probability” that P coupled with lack of
“actual belief” that Not-P.49 Such instructions are often given in cases
where the prosecution presents some minimal evidence of willful
45. But see S. REP. NO. 96-553, at 60 (1980) (noting appellate courts’ use of five
different meanings of “knowledge” in the federal criminal code). The Senate Report
explains,
[knowledge] has been defined in terms of awareness; in terms of a defendant's
inference from the circumstances or belief that something is probably true; in
terms of a defendant's awareness of a “high probability” that a circumstance
exists; in terms of intentional or purposeful or “studied ignorance” as to the
existence of a fact; and in terms of “gross indifference to” or “willful neglect
of” a duty in respect to ascertainment of particular facts.

CRIMINAL JURY INSTRUCTIONS § 2.06 (Comm. on Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions Dist.

instructions simply as “with knowledge.” See, e.g., United States v. Guzman, 781 F.2d 428,
431 (5th Cir. 1986).
48. In Rosemond, for example, as is common with aiding and abetting instructions, the
instruction simply stated that the jury must determine whether the defendant “knew” that his
partner was, or would be, armed. Jury Instructions at 46, United States v. Rosemond, No.
2:07-CR-886 (D. Utah 2011). Although the Supreme Court’s decision with respect to those
instructions spoke of knowledge as “awareness,” “full awareness,” or “full knowledge,” the
Court gave no indication that the instructions erred in not defining the term itself as it
appeared in the count for aiding and abetting. See Rosemond v. United States, 134 S. Ct.
1240, 1248-50 (2014).

“knowledge” where neither statutory definition nor relevant legislative history was
available). As these and many other cases indicate, non-MPC jurisdictions such as the
federal courts are heavily influenced by the MPC.

ignorance.50 They typically add a requirement that the defendant
purposefully avoided acquiring additional certainty of P, though that
purposeful avoidance may simply be a failure to investigate when it would
have been easy to do so.51 Third, federal jury instructions often state that
“[t]he word ‘knowingly’ . . . means that the act was done voluntarily and
intentionally and not because of mistake or accident,” or some close
variation.52 Such instructions use a much more minimal conception of
knowledge than that provided in MPC-based instructions and other federal
instructions.53
As for belief states other than “knowledge,” federal instructions
frequently contain ambiguities similar to those previously noted with
respect to recklessness and negligence under the MPC.54 For example, they
employ terms like “conscious avoidance” and “awareness” that are

50. But see 1 LEONARD B. SAND ET AL., MODERN FEDERAL JURY INSTRUCTIONS § 3A.01,
at 11 (2011) (stating that “the giving of this instruction” absent evidence of willful ignorance
in a federal circuit that requires such evidence “is subject to the harmless error rule, and has
been excused on numerous occasions”) (collecting cases).
51. But see Michaels, supra note 25, at 988-89 (“In practice, the purposeful avoidance
requirement adds practically nothing” since “liability may be predicated on omission to
learn: The defendant need not close his eyes to be liable; he can be convicted for failure to
investigate.”). Indeed, Judge Posner’s opinion in United States v. Giovannetti, often cited as
a more strenuous assertion of the need for evidence of “deliberate effort to avoid guilty
knowledge,” notes that such effort “can be a mental, as well as a physical, effort—a cutting
off of one’s normal curiosity by an effort of will.” 919 F.2d 1223, 1229 (7th Cir. 1990).
52. See, e.g., PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS (CRIMINAL CASES) § 2.13 (Comm. on Pattern
Criminal Jury Instructions First Circuit 1998)); ELEVENTH CIRCUIT PATTERN JURY
INSTRUCTIONS (CRIMINAL CASES) § 9.1A (Comm. on Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions of
the Judicial Council of the Eleventh Circuit 2010). Such instructions, though common, have
received little attention from commentators discussing mental state requirements. This is
noteworthy in part because, if taken literally, popular versions of the instruction imply that a
defendant who was ignorant of P, but who would have taken the same action had she known
that P, acted “knowingly” with respect to P, since such a defendant acts “intentionally and
voluntarily, and not because of ignorance or mistake.” Cf. Michaels, supra note 25 (arguing
that a similar counterfactual-based mental state should be employed in criminal law).
53. Despite their seemingly minimal requirements for knowledge, it bears emphasis that
neither these instructions, nor other federal criminal instructions, use the term “believe” as a
substitute for “know.” In other words, in the jury instructions that follow the abstract
definition of “to act knowingly,” the issue is always presented as whether the defendant
“knew that” P, not whether the defendant merely “believed that” P.
54. See, e.g., ALEXANDER & FERZAN, supra note 14, at 25 (noting that the MPC
recklessness “formulation is substantially the same as the formulations of recklessness in
federal and state criminal codes and judicial decisions”).

ambiguous with respect to occurrent versus dispositional belief.55 Likewise,
federal statutes and instructions refer to what the defendant “actually
believe[d]” or had “reason[] to believe,” where belief may be construed as a
“deep down” emotional or conative acceptance or as merely intellectual
acknowledgment.56
III. An Empirically Informed Account of Belief State Ascription
The previous Section gave an overview of the many places where
criminal law invokes belief states. It also highlighted ambiguities in jury
instructions with respect to belief states, noting previous attempts to resolve
those ambiguities and thus to explain precisely what factual findings are
required to satisfy various mens rea requirements. This Section temporarily
sets aside commentators’ attempts to make sense of those legally salient
concepts and examines instead how laypeople, in response to circumstantial
evidence, interpret and ascribe belief states. In doing so, it draws from
experimental epistemology, an area of empirical research previously
overlooked in the legal literature.
A. Introducing Experimental Epistemology
Philosophers (and legal theorists) often appeal to supposedly widely
shared intuitions about what does and does not constitute a given belief
state.57 Experimental epistemologists investigate empirically whether
laypeople actually share the intuitions to which “armchair” philosophers
appeal, in the hopes that philosophical analyses of belief-state concepts can

55. See, e.g., United States v. Lange, 528 F.2d 1280, 1288 (5th Cir. 1976) (stating that
“conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth” plus “reckless disregard of the truth” suffices
for knowledge that a statement was false for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1001).
56. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2339 (2012) (criminalizing the harboring or concealing of
those the defendant “knows, or has reasonable grounds to believe,” have committed or are
about to commit certain offenses); Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 46 n.93 (1969)
(utilizing the MPC’s definition of knowledge, which requires an absence of “actual belief”
that Not-P); United States v. Gansman, 657 F.3d 85, 94 (2d Cir. 2011) (upholding a
“conscious avoidance” instruction employing the “actual belief” language from the MPC).

be made to more accurately account for lay-usage.58 Whatever the
implications for philosophical analyses of the concepts in question,
experimental epistemologists’ findings concerning how laypeople ascribe
belief states help fill a crucial gap in our understanding of legally relevant
belief states.
Before turning to belief states specifically, this Section begins with an
introduction to one of the central findings in experimental philosophy: the
“Side-Effect Effect.” Although the Side-Effect Effect concerns desire-state
and causal-influence ascription rather than belief-state ascription,
understanding it will help in understanding its close relative, the Epistemic
Side-Effect Effect, which concerns belief-state ascription.
1. The Side-Effect Effect
In his seminal 2003 study of desire-state ascription (more specifically,
intentionality), Professor Joshua Knobe presented subjects with the
following vignette (with two variations indicated in italics):
The vice-president of a company went to the chairman of the
board and said, “We are thinking of starting a new program. We
are sure that it will help us increase profits, and it will also
help/harm the environment.” The chairman of the board
answered, “I don’t care at all about helping/harming the
environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s
start the new program.” They started the new program. Sure
enough, the environment was helped/harmed.59
Subjects in the “help” condition were asked, “Did the chairman help the
environment intentionally?” A large majority said “no.”60 Subjects in the
“harm” condition were asked whether the chairman harmed the
environment intentionally. A large majority said “yes.”61 This
phenomenon—laypeople’s ascription of intentionality to agents bringing
about counter-normative side effects but not to agents bringing about norm-

compliant side effects62—is known as the “Knobe Effect” or the “SideEffect Effect” (SEE).
Since Knobe’s original study, a vast literature has replicated the same
basic asymmetry in a broad range of cases.63 These studies altered, among
other things, the characters, story structure, outcomes, and the properties
that study participants were asked to ascribe.64 It turns out that the SEE is
observable not just where an actor produces a bad side-effect (whether or
not he is indifferent to the side-effect, as the chairman purports to be, or
instead actively dislikes it), but also where an actor knowingly causes
something bad to happen as a means to an end (whether or not the end is
good or bad).65 And people’s willingness to ascribe intentionality in badoutcome cases persists even where the agent knew only of a very small risk
that the outcome would come about.66 It also turns out that the asymmetry
observed in intentionality ascription applies to a host of other desire-state
ascriptions such as being “in favor of” the good or bad outcome.67 And
even attributions of causal influence—i.e., the degree of causal
responsibility attributed to the act in question as opposed to other partial
causes—are significantly higher where an agent’s action results in a

62. I use the term “norm-compliant” to mean merely “not in violation of a salient
norm.” To be norm-compliant, an action or an outcome need not have resulted from any
desire or motivation to comply with a norm; it is enough that the action or outcome happens
to comply with norms. See Richard Holton, Norms and the Knobe Effect, 70 ANALYSIS 1

foreseen negative outcome rather than a foreseen positive one.68 Finally, it
turns out that the asymmetry is not merely a response to immorality on the
part of the agent. Instead, the SEE is observable where an action or
outcome deviates from normative expectations, including where the
deviation is from non-moral descriptive norms,69 and, perhaps most
surprisingly, where the action is regarded as morally praiseworthy but
deviates from prudential norms (i.e., is against the agent’s self-interest).70

These findings are all puzzling. Why would the normative implications
of the chairman’s (or other protagonist’s) action affect the degree of
intention, causal responsibility, etc., that laypeople ascribe to him or her?
Scholars have proposed numerous explanations for the SEE that, for present
purposes, can be divided into two camps: competence theories and error
theories.
First, competence theories posit that laypeople are competently applying
the relevant concepts to the vignettes they are presented, but that it turns out
concepts like intentionality and causality, properly understood and applied,
depend in part on the normative valence of the actor’s action.71 In other
words, competence theorists think that the SEE derives from a correct
understanding of the concepts of intentionality and causality. Turning to
law, some competence theorists have argued that law should reflect
laypeople’s conceptual understandings, and that law should therefore, more
often than it currently does, treat foreknowledge of an outcome as sufficient
for a finding that the actor intentionally caused that outcome.72
The second group of explanations, error theories, posit that the SEE is a
symptom of biased, or “motivated,” reasoning73—specifically, a desire to
blame those who bring about a bad outcome, regardless of mental state.74
Such error theories are sometimes called “blame first” models, because they
posit that an initial impulse to blame leads people to ascribe whatever
mental or causal attribute might justify that initial blame impulse.75

Conversely, competence theories posit that attributions of blame come later
in the process, after evaluation of the agent’s mental state.76 Error theorists
typically argue that the law should not embrace laypeople’s ascription
practices.77 Instead, error theorists think the SEE is evidence of undesirably
normative considerations entering into mental-state and causality
ascriptions that are supposed to be purely descriptive.
Neither explanation fully accounts for the data. Competence theorists
have trouble explaining why otherwise-irrelevant character information—
for example, telling subjects that the protagonist was a drug dealer—
increases desire-state and causality ascription (i.e., increases the extent to
which laypeople find that the agent (a) intended to bring about the bad
outcome and (b) was causally responsible for the outcome despite
alternative causes).78 Likewise, error theorists have trouble explaining why
the SEE occurs in cases where the agent’s norm-deviation is morally
positive or morally neutral.79 They also have trouble substantiating the
claim that blame attribution comes prior to mental state attribution, rather
than the other way around.80
Until recently, both explanations, along with all scholarship concerning
the SEE, were also premised on a crucial and unfounded assumption—
namely, that study participants regarded the protagonists in the help and
harm condition as knowing that the good or bad outcome would result.81

That is, scholars sought to explain why subjects treated actors who
“knowingly” brought about worse outcomes as if they had intentionally
caused the outcomes. Until recently, however, nobody examined whether
study participants were actually ascribing knowledge, or even belief, to the
agent in both conditions. Scholars failed to examine whether the differences
in desire-state and causality ascription might be attributable to differences
in something more fundamental: belief-state ascription. As the next Section
explains, that appears to be exactly what was happening.
2. The Epistemic Side-Effect Effect
It turns out that belief-state ascription reveals the same asymmetry
previously noted for ascription of intentionality, causality, and other
attributes.82 The first study to show this gave participants Knobe’s original
chairman vignette and asked whether the chairman “knew” that the program
would harm (or help) the environment. Respondents were significantly
more likely to attribute knowledge to the chairman in the harm case than in
the help case.83
In subsequent studies, this phenomenon—the “Epistemic Side-Effect
Effect” (ESEE)—has been consistently shown in the broad range of settings
in which the SEE has been shown.84 In short, laypeople are significantly
more likely to ascribe belief that P and knowledge that P where “P” is that a
norm-deviant outcome will result, that a norm-deviant circumstance
obtains, or that one’s action is norm-deviant, compared to where P is norm-

84. See supra notes 63-70, 82. To be sure, there are more published SEE experiments
than ESEE experiments. After all, the latter effect was discovered relatively recently.
Nonetheless, ESEE experiments to date have largely used the basic experimental structure
and vignettes that the SEE studies use, and have found results that consistently track the SEE
experiment results in these various settings.

consistent.85 While the SEE showed that normative valence impacts desirestate and causality ascription, the ESEE shows that it also impacts beliefstate ascription.
The ESEE largely explains the SEE. In the chairman studies, for
example, people are more likely to ascribe intentionality, desire, causation,
etc., in the “harm” case than in the “help” case because they are more likely
to ascribe to the chairman belief that the new policy will harm the
environment, as well as knowledge that the policy will harm the
environment. Indeed, take away the differential belief and knowledge
ascriptions, and the SEE nearly disappears.86
But insofar as the ESEE explains the SEE, the question becomes: what
explains the ESEE? Why would the question of whether or not one believes
that P or knows that P depend on the normative valence of one’s P-relevant
action? This seems contrary to just about any philosophical or legal
understanding of “knowledge” and “belief,” which are traditionally
considered purely descriptive, non-evaluative mental state concepts.87
As with the SEE, the ESEE may be explained using a competence theory
or an error theory. A competence theory would say that laypeople are
competently applying the relevant concepts to the vignettes they are
85. Indeed, the same asymmetry appears even where: (a) subjects in the “harm”
condition are told that the chairman was notified only that there was a “slight chance” that
the new program would harm the environment, and (b) subjects in the “help” condition are
told that the chairman was notified that there was a “very strong chance” that the new
program would help the environment. See Beebe & Jensen, supra note 81, at 707; Dalbauer,
supra note 82.
86. In situations where the chairman receives no information about the environmental
impact of the plan one way or another (i.e., nobody tells him it will help or harm it), the SEE
diminishes greatly. Sandra Pellizzoni et al., Beliefs and Moral Valence Affect Intentionality
Attributions: The Case of Side Effects, 1 REV. PHIL. & PSYCHOL. 201, 201 (2010). And when
subjects are explicitly told that the chairman in the harm condition believes the policy will
not harm the environment, and the chairman in the help condition believes the policy will
not help the environment, the SEE disappears completely. Id.

Pragmatic Turn in Epistemology, AM. PHILOSOPHICAL Q. (forthcoming 2016) (tracing to
John Locke the roots of philosophical accounts of knowledge as linked to “actionability”).
To be more precise, the traditional conception of “knowledge” is evaluative insofar as it
entails “justification,” which is a normative concept. But the traditional notion of
justification is epistemically evaluative; it is not supposed to concern evaluative
considerations of the sort found in ESEE cases.

presented, but that it turns out concepts like “belief” and “knowledge,”
properly understood and applied, depend in part on the normative valence
of the actor’s action.88 Turning to law, a competence theorist could argue
that law should, for example, allow smaller degrees of certainty to
constitute “knowledge” where the agent’s action was especially counternormative.89
Alternatively, one might be tempted to endorse an error-based
explanation of the ESEE. Perhaps laypeople see a bad outcome, have an
impulse to blame somebody, and satisfy that impulse by ascribing whatever
mental state seems to inculpate the actor who brought the outcome about.90
Turning to law, an error theorist could argue that the ESEE is evidence of
undesirably normative considerations entering into what should be purely
descriptive belief-state ascriptions. As a result, the error theorist might
propose means of “de-biasing” jurors’ belief-state ascriptions so that they
are unaffected by how good or bad the defendant’s actions were.
Although an error theory may be a good partial explanation for the
ESEE, it fails to account for much of the data.91 First, it fails to account for
the studies showing greater belief and knowledge attribution in cases of
morally good or morally neutral norm-deviation.92 Second, the ESEE
appears less susceptible to the sorts of otherwise-irrelevant bad character
information that, when it increased intentionality- and causality-ascription
rates in SEE harm scenarios, led some scholars to conclude that the
asymmetries were largely attributable to motivated reasoning.93
In short, the relative counter-normativity of P-relevant actions and their
outcomes, rather than, or in addition to, the blameworthiness of the agent,

89. As explained further in Part IV, infra, I am dubious of such a quick move from the
descriptive to the normative.

recent accounts of desire-state and causality ascription. See, e.g., Nadler & McDonnell,

plays a large role in determining whether an agent is deemed to have known
or believed that P. In the following Section, I explain why this is so, not by
relying on a philosophical or legal analysis of the concepts in question, but
by couching the ESEE within a broader, empirically based account of
laypeople’s belief-ascription practices and their functional concepts of
knowledge and belief.
B. Bringing the Data Together: A Descriptive Account of Belief State
Ascription
This Section provides an account of what factors influence laypeople’s
belief-state ascription, using legal examples along the way.94 It does so in
two steps, the first addressing belief ascription (along with awareness and
similar concepts), and the second addressing knowledge ascription.95 These
two steps can be summarized as follows: (1) counter-normativity spurs
belief formation, and (2) “Actionability” makes (true) belief knowledge.
1. Ascribing Belief
Under what circumstances are laypeople likely to ascribe belief that P?
In some cases, the answer is easy; perhaps the defendant admits to having
believed that P, or his actions would make no sense unless he believed that
P. But where the evidence doesn’t obviously point one way or another, layascription will be influenced by both (a) how laypeople reason about other
people’s thought processes, and (b) how laypeople interpret terms like
“belief” and “awareness.”96 I address each in turn.
a) The Norm-Violation / Belief-Ascription Heuristic
As we have seen, laypeople more often ascribe belief that P to agents
whose P-relevant actions were counter-normative. Why would laypeople
treat normative valence as relevant to the question of whether or not an
94. Although this Section uses legal examples by way of illustration, Part IV, infra,
explains more fully how these belief state ascription practices relate to criminal law.
95. This second step is where the ESEE is explained. See infra Section III.B.2.
96. This Article’s account of lay-ascription does not concern trials in which evidence
obviously establishes the defendant’s mental state, leaving no room for reasonable
disagreement. Instead, this Article addresses what might be called “close cases,” in much the
same way that theories of adjudication often focus on “hard cases” to determine what factors
influence judges’ interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. Likewise, this Article
does not attempt to delineate every single factor that might influence a given juror’s belief
state ascription even in close cases—e.g., whether the defendant appeared honest while
testifying, what the juror ate for breakfast, etc. Instead, it focuses on several
underappreciated factors highlighted by recent empirical literature discussed above.

agent believed that P? The answer is that counter-normativity comes with
the risk of sanctions, both formal and informal, and that risk makes it
comparatively more useful to form true beliefs to the effect that one is
violating a norm than to form true beliefs to the effect that one is adhering
to a norm.97 So unless evidence strongly implies otherwise, laypeople
presume that others pause to form an accurate belief one way or another
before deviating from a norm.98 In short, laypeople employ what may be
called the “norm-violation/belief-ascription heuristic”: all else being equal,
insofar as an agent’s action would make it the case that X, where X violates
a norm salient to the agent, attribute to the agent the belief that the action at
issue would make it the case that X.99 Where the norm violation is less
serious or less salient to the actor, people are less likely to ascribe such
beliefs. Conversely, where the norm violation is more serious or more
salient, people are more likely to ascribe such beliefs.
b) Different Kinds of Belief: Occurrent and Dispositional, Thick and
Thin
Laypeople’s ascriptions of belief are responsive not only to how
laypeople reason about other minds but also to what they understand terms
like “belief” to mean. As it turns out, laypeople understand the concept of
“belief” to signify several distinct types of mental states. Experimental
epistemologists noted this phenomenon when investigating why—contrary

97. Alfano et al., supra note 69, at 268-70. Of course, external sanctions need not be the
only reason norm-deviations give agents pause. Given agents’ self-interest and moral
conscience, it is sensible to assume agents are cautious about breaking norms even where
they believe the chance of detection is zero.
98. Recall that the chairman in the original ESEE example stated that he did not care
about the environment. Still, it is reasonable for study participants to posit that he cared
enough about the consequences (to others or, perhaps more likely to himself) of harming the
environment to form a true belief about it—hence the greater belief attribution to the
chairman in the harm scenario (where his actions are norm deviant) than in the help scenario
(where his actions are norm-compliant). Cf. Holton, supra note 62, at 1.
99. See Alfano et al., supra note 69, at 268 (proposing a slightly different formulation of
what they label the “Norm-violation/Belief-attribution heuristic”). Generally speaking, the
greater the norm violation, the more useful the formation of the true belief in question, and
hence the more likely the agent is to form such a true belief. As a result, laypeople will be
especially likely to ascribe to an agent belief that P where P represents a more serious or
consequential norm violation. Of course, whereas my explanation for the heuristic explains it
in terms of how people reason about other minds, a “blame first” error theory might instead
posit that the more serious the norm-deviation, the more motivated one is to blame the agent.
Either way, the resulting pattern of belief ascription is the same.

to virtually all previous philosophical accounts of knowledge100 (and
contrary to all legal accounts of knowledge)101—laypeople sometimes
ascribe to an agent knowledge that P while simultaneously ascribing to that
agent no belief that P.102 How, experimental philosophers wondered, could
people ascribe knowledge that P without belief that P? Doesn’t knowledge
entail belief?103 The answer turns out to be that knowledge does require
“belief,” but it requires a more minimal type of belief than laypeople
sometimes interpret words like “belief” to denote. This raises an important
point: when we ask laypeople to ascribe belief (along with related terms
like “awareness” and “conscious disregard”), context will determine which
type of belief they take to be at issue.
First, beliefs can be occurrent or dispositional.104 Occurrent belief is
conscious endorsement at a given moment.105 Dispositional belief is
information stored in the mind available for endorsement under typical
conditions.106 Here is one example where laypeople’s implicit
understanding of belief as either dispositional or occurrent determines their
ascriptions of belief and knowledge: Kate panics during her history exam
and, despite having repeatedly memorized the date of Queen Elizabeth’s
death, feels sure she has forgotten.107 She answers “1603,” thinking it just a

guess, but in fact that is the correct answer.108 Most study participants
presented with this vignette assumed “belief” meant occurrent belief, and
consequently ascribed to Kate knowledge that Queen Elizabeth died in
1603 but not belief that she died in 1603.109 In follow-up studies, however,
participants were primed to consider dispositional belief, and consequently
ascribed both knowledge and belief.110 Other vignettes produce similar
findings.111
To take a legal example, imagine a ski instructor, Hall, who skis down a
hill in an unusually dangerous manner, contrary to any advice he would
give even an experienced skier. Hall accidentally crashes into another skier,
killing the other skier.112 Did Hall believe his action posed such risk of
death (that is, was he aware of the risk so as to be knowing or reckless)? Or
did Hall instead have no such belief (that is, did he fail to consider whether,
or was he unaware that, his action posed such a risk, so as to be negligent or
legally blameless)? If one employs a concept of occurrent belief, one is
much more likely to conclude that Hall had no such belief; he was likely
not consciously considering the risk as he zoomed down the hill. Indeed,
because knowledge does not entail occurrent belief (i.e., knowledge can
involve merely dispositional belief),113 someone primed to consider
occurrent belief might even say Hall knew that skiing in such a manner
posed such an unjustifiable risk, but he did not believe or was not aware of
it at the relevant time, much as Kate knew but did not believe that Queen
Elizabeth died in 1603.114 But if one instead employs a concept of
dispositional belief, one is likely to conclude Hall did believe that skiing in
that manner posed a grave risk; as a ski instructor, he was likely aware of
the risk as a general matter even if he wasn’t consciously considering it at
the time.115 In short, whether the defendant was aware of the risk depends

on whether awareness is occurrent or dispositional, and some factual
scenarios and instructions prime different answers to that question.
Second, and independent of the occurrent versus dispositional
distinction, beliefs can be either “thin” or “thick.”116 Thin belief requires
merely a “bare cognitive pro-attitude,”117 the sort of belief people have
whenever they think the proposition in question is more likely true than not
true. Thick belief requires some sort of emotion or conation,118 which can
be roughly described as an “inner conviction” as to the truth of the
proposition in question.119
To see the difference between thin and thick belief, consider the
following example. George the Geocentrist answers on a test that the earth
revolves around the sun. In some sense George acknowledges this on an
intellectual level, but, due to deeply felt religious conviction, he believes
that the sun revolves around the earth.120 As it turns out, a significant
number of laypeople attribute to George knowledge that the earth revolves
around the sun but not belief that it does (once again, an ascription pattern
previously deemed incoherent).121 They do this because, contrary to legal
conceptions of belief as an intellectual probabilistic judgment, the factual
scenario implicitly primes them to consider belief in its thick form, which
requires some deeper form of mental assent or inner conviction. Other
vignettes (not involving religious faith) produce similar findings.122
To take a legal example, imagine a case in which a chairman like the one
in Knobe’s original vignette is criminally prosecuted for harming the
been aware of in the particular situation.” Id. at 15. The jury ultimately convicted Hall of
negligence, which, in line with the MPC, the jury instructions defined as “fail[ure] to
perceive” a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Id. at 18; see People v. Hall, 59 P.3d at 299.

environment.123 The question of belief state arises: Did the chairman
believe or know the environment would be harmed (recklessness or
knowledge), or did he fail to consider whether it would be harmed
(negligence or legal blamelessness)? If one employs a concept of thick
belief, one is more likely to conclude that the chairman did not believe the
policy would harm the environment. Perhaps the busy, flippant chairman
didn’t care enough about environmental harm to have formed the sort of
deeper coming-to-grips-with or acceptance that would satisfy a thick belief
requirement. Indeed, employing a concept of thick belief, one might even
say the chairman knew the environment would be harmed but did not really
believe it. Study participants in the chairman studies, after all, reported
greater confidence in ascribing knowledge to the chairman than in ascribing
belief.124 But if instead one employs a concept of thin belief, one is more
likely to conclude that the chairman did believe that the environment would
be harmed—i.e., that on a purely intellectual level, he acknowledged that
the environment would likely be harmed.
The distinction between thick and thin belief, though only briefly
sketched here, may make a dispositive difference in jurors’ mens rea
findings in numerous legal contexts, including, for example, cases in which:
(1) the defendant purports to have a deep religious conviction relevant to
P;125 (2) the defendant purports to have a cognitive defect related to
practical or moral reasoning, such as an inability to “appreciate” the
wrongfulness of her actions;126 (3) the defendant is a group entity (e.g., a
corporation), arguably incapable of possessing thick beliefs, or at least less
likely than an individual to possess them;127 (4) the defendant seemingly

(5) the defendant’s actions appear to have arisen from sub-conscious
prejudice.129
To summarize the two main points concerning belief ascription: (a)
laypeople tend to ascribe belief that P to an agent taking a P-relevant action
where P is norm-deviant,130 and (b) laypeople’s belief ascriptions are
sensitive to what type of belief (occurrent or dispositional, thick or thin)
they are primed to consider.
2. Ascribing Knowledge
When is a belief that P deemed knowledge that P? Laypeople’s
knowledge ascriptions typically reflect the following conception of
knowledge131: An agent knows that P if (1) P is true, (2) the agent believes
that P (in any sense—dispositionally or occurrently, thickly or thinly), and
(3) the agent’s belief that P is “Actionable.” The first requirement—the

corporate entity’s mental state and an individual’s mental state). In the corporate context, the
difference between thick and thin belief may influence not only the guilt versus innocence
question posed to jurors in criminal trials but also the triggering of punitive damages in civil
cases. Jurors might interpret a corporation’s having undertaken explicit cost-benefit analyses,
for example, as evidence that a corporation engaged in the sort of reflective coming-to-gripswith or premeditation sometimes associated with thick belief. Cf. W. Kip Viscusi, Corporate

capturing laypeople’s concept of knowledge (as that concept operates in both civil and
criminal cases, though the focus here is on criminal cases) than does the prevailing account

truth condition—is familiar and relatively uncontroversial.132 The second
requirement—the belief condition—is part of the traditional definition of
knowledge, though it contains some refinement in light of the different
kinds of belief described above.133 The third requirement—the Actionability
condition—is likely new to most readers and requires unpacking.134
An agent’s belief is Actionable when (a) it is relevant to some salient
practical decision, and (b) for purposes of making the practical decision, the
agent ought (rationally) to treat its truth as settled, given the agent’s values,
desires, degree of subjective certainty, and practical circumstances. In other
words, an agent’s belief that P is Actionable when, in deciding how to act,
the agent ought to assume that P.
An agent’s degree of subjective certainty is an important determinant of
whether her belief was Actionable. But—and this will be important when,
in Part IV below, we return to the supposed differences between knowledge
and recklessness—the amount of subjective certainty required to make a
belief Actionable depends on context. More specifically, the requisite
amount of subjective certainty varies according to (a) pragmatic features of
the agent’s situation, and (b) the normative valence of the course of action
at issue. I address each in turn below.
a) Pragmatic Features of the Agent’s Situation
Whether a true belief was Actionable, and thus counted as knowledge,
often depends on the practical options available to the agent at the time she
engaged in the P-relevant action in question. Agents often act in situations
that don’t require a stark choice between P and Not-P. They can hedge their

133. See supra notes 104-29 and accompanying text.
134. See Turri & Buckwalter, supra note 87, at 4. Two traditional conditions of
knowledge will strike philosophers as conspicuously absent: (1) justification, and (2) a
proper causal relation between the justificatory evidence and the belief formed. See Ichikawa
& Steup, supra note 103. Both can be set aside for present purposes. First, justification is
largely captured by the Actionability requirement and in any event appears to play a
relatively minor role in lay-ascription. See Buckwalter, Gettier Made ESEE, supra note 82,
at 368; Sackris & Beebe, supra note 128, at 189 (reporting empirical evidence that laypeople
ascribe knowledge to agents whose true beliefs are not “justified” according to the
traditional philosophical account of justification); Christina Starmans & Ori Friedman, The
Folk Conception of Knowledge, 124 COGNITION 272, 280 (2012). Second, the “causal
relation” condition is relevant to lay-ascription only in an extremely small subset of cases
and is rarely implicated in criminal cases. See John Turri et al., Knowledge and Luck,
PSYCHONOMIC BULL. & REV. 378, 382 (2015).

bets because they have courses of action available that allow for a
probability assessment to influence the action in question. When such
alternative courses of action are available, an agent’s bare belief that P (as
opposed to her more nuanced probability assessment) is less likely to be
Actionable and is thus less likely to be deemed knowledge that P.135
To take a legal example, imagine a drug “mule” who was handed a
briefcase and told to transport it for money.136 She believed it 60% likely
that the briefcase contained drugs. She wouldn’t have transported the
briefcase if she had been 100% certain that it contained drugs, but given her
view of the odds and the money involved, she decided to transport the
briefcase, which, as it turns out, did in fact have drugs inside. She believed
there were drugs inside, but did she know there were drugs inside?
Imagine two scenarios. In Scenario 1, the briefcase was locked and she
had no means of opening it. She had no way of obtaining greater certainty,
so in deciding what to do, she should have proceeded on the assumption
that there were drugs inside. In other words, her belief that there were drugs
inside was Actionable. Therefore, regardless which course of action she
ultimately decided on—transport it or don’t transport it—she will likely be
deemed to have known that there were drugs inside.137 In effect, laypeople
treat the question, “Did she know there were drugs in the briefcase?” as
meaning, “For practical purposes, did she know there were drugs in the
briefcase?”138
In Scenario 2, the briefcase is not locked and she is aware of an available
low-cost alternative course of action: she could look inside the briefcase. In
135. See generally Turri & Buckwalter, supra note 87.
136. Cf. infra notes 180-98 and accompanying text (discussing the relationship between
knowledge and willful ignorance).
137. I use the word “likely” to once again highlight that the factor affecting knowledge
ascription here influences, but does not fully dictate, an ascription of knowledge. As noted
previously, there are plenty of additional factors that would bear on whether the drug mule
would be deemed to have knowledge. As with the study of judicial behavior—or any human
behavior, for that matter—this Article does not attempt to account for every such possible
influence. Cf. supra note 96. Additionally, the phrase “will be deemed to have knowledge,”
highlights that the important thing here, as elsewhere in this Article, is whether jurors would
call a given mental state “knowledge” in every-day life or in court, not whether the mental
state lives up to some other more absolute concept of knowledge that diverges from lay
usage. See supra note 58 and accompanying text; infra note 211 and accompanying text.
138. For empirical literature concerning the related issue of stakes to the agent of being
wrong about P, and how those stakes impact knowledge ascription, see Pinillos & Simpson,
supra note 87; Chandra Sekhar Sripada & Jason Stanley, Empirical Tests of Interest-Relative
Invariantism, 9 EPISTEME 3 (2012); Turri & Buckwalter, supra note 87, at 25 (concluding
that the stakes effect on knowledge ascription is fully mediated by Actionability).

[Vol. 68:497

Scenario 2, given her preferences and the courses of action available to her,
she should not treat the truth of the proposition, “there are drugs inside,” as
settled. Instead, she should act as if “there is a 60% chance that there are
drugs inside”—i.e., she should look inside the briefcase. Whereas in
Scenario 1 there was no practical difference between acting as if there were
drugs inside and acting as if there was a 60% chance there were drugs
inside, in Scenario 2 there is a difference. Because she has this alternative
action available in Scenario 2 but not in Scenario 1, her bare belief that
there were drugs in the briefcase was Actionable in Scenerio 1 but not in
Scenario 2, and is thus, all else being equal, more likely to be deemed
knowledge in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2.
As the drug mule example illustrates, one important alternative course of
action that affects Actionability is the possibility of considering further
whether P or Not-P, either through consulting additional evidence or
through engaging in additional deliberation. Sometimes, though, that
alternative course of action is unavailable due to time constraints. An
agent’s time constraints thus sometimes affect Actionability and thereby
affect knowledge ascription.
For example, in one experiment participants were asked about a medical
student who, due to an extreme shortage in hospital personnel, is put in
charge of a patient and must decide which of three medications to
administer.139 In one scenario, she has months to decide, and she picks the
right one. In another she has two minutes to decide, and she picks the right
one. In both, she believes the medication she picks is the right one.
Participants were significantly more likely to say the student “knew” the
medication she picked was the right one when she had two minutes to
deliberate rather than several months.140 Another experiment found the
same effect when asking about whether a college student who cares a lot
about his paper “knows” his paper contains no misspellings, where in one
scenario he has five minutes to proofread it and in the other he has two
weeks.141 In short, at least in some circumstances, all else being equal, the
less time you have to consider whether P, the more likely your belief that P
is to be deemed knowledge that P.
More generally, where for practical purposes one must act as if P or NotP, one’s belief that P or that Not-P is deemed knowledge (so long as it turns
out to be true), even if one had lingering subjective uncertainty. In other

words, under sufficient practical constraints, knowledge ascription tends to
collapse into (true) belief ascription because mere belief, under sufficient
practical constraints, is Actionable.
That said, such practical constraints are often not present; agents often
have additional time to deliberate, additional evidence to consult, etc. When
the agent is not so practically constrained, the amount of subjective
certainty necessary to make a belief Actionable often depends on the
normative valence of the salient action to which that belief is relevant. Let’s
now briefly turn to those normative considerations.
b) Normative Valence of the Course of Action at Issue
Where moral norms are salient, they predominate in the Actionability
analysis. If, and to the extent that, a P-relevant action would deviate from a
moral norm in the event P is true, the agent’s belief that P is likely to be
deemed Actionable.142 In other words, the worse (in terms of morality) that
P being true would make an agent’s action, the more likely that the agent’s
belief that P constitutes knowledge that P. That’s because, where P is moral
norm-deviant, one need not have very great subjective certainty that P in
order to make it the case that one ought to act as if P—i.e., in order to make
it the case that one’s belief that P is Actionable.
Consider again the chairman example.143 Imagine that the chairmen in
the harm and help conditions each believe the vice president’s testimony,
thinking it 60% likely that the new program will help or harm the
environment as the case may be. Why might the belief be considered
Actionable, and hence knowledge, in the harm condition but not the help
condition? Because the stakes, in terms of potential moral norm-deviation,
are higher in the harm condition than in the help condition.144 The greater
the moral norm-deviation, the lower the subjective certainty required to
make the belief knowledge. This same pattern accounts for the numerous
experimental findings discussed and cited above, which go far beyond the
chairman example.145 A similar explanation even makes sense of the
142. See Beebe & Buckwalter, supra note 82, at 494; Buckwalter, Gettier Made ESEE,
supra note 82, at 380.
143. See supra note 59 and accompanying text.
144. In the help condition, whether or not the chairman’s belief turns out to be correct
and the environment is helped, the outcome will not violate a moral norm, since merely
failing to actively help the environment is not moral norm-deviant. See, e.g., Holton, supra
note 62, at 3-4; Solan, supra note 2, at 524-25. But in the harm condition, the moral stakes
are higher, since approving a policy that harms the environment is moral norm-deviant.

otherwise-puzzling ESEE findings in cases of morally positive and morally
neutral norm-deviation,146 though those cases are less directly relevant to
criminal law.147
IV. Surprising Divergences Between Mens Rea Theory and Practice:
What They Are, Why They Matter, and How to Begin Addressing Them
A brief recap is in order. Part II examined possible ways to construe the
belief states invoked in criminal jury instructions. Those instructions
contain numerous ambiguities concerning the make-up of the belief states
they tell jurors to ascribe. Commentators offering descriptive and normative
accounts of criminal mens rea concepts have sought to explain and resolve
some of these ambiguities, though without recourse to empirical findings
concerning lay-usage.
146. See supra notes 69-70 and accompanying text. Where there is no moral duty at
issue, and P’s being true would make an action go against one’s self-interest or would make
an action go against convention, for example, one’s belief that P requires less certainty in
order to be Actionable than it would require if it were norm-compliant. See supra notes 6970 and accompanying text.
Consider, as an example of the influence of non-moral norms, a long-standing puzzle in
the philosophical literature concerning lotteries: If a lottery ticket holder is aware that there
is only a one-in-a-million chance her ticket is a winner, why are laypeople hesitant to ascribe
to her, prior to the announcement of the winning number, knowledge that her ticket is a
loser? See JOHN HAWTHORNE, KNOWLEDGE AND LOTTERIES (2004); Enoch & Fisher, supra
note 57, at 573-74 (using the lottery example as an allegedly “nonpractical” illustration of
laypeople’s aversion to ascribing knowledge based on naked statistical evidence); John Turri
& Ori Friedman, Winners and Losers in the Folk Epistemology of Lotteries, in ADVANCES IN
EXPERIMENTAL EPISTEMOLOGY, supra note 58, at 45. My analysis above suggests an answer:
the lottery ticket holder, even if she believes her ticket is almost certainly a loser, should not
act on the assumption that it is a loser, but instead should act on her more nuanced
probability assessment—i.e., that she has a ticket with a one-in-a-million chance of being a
winner. There is a real, salient practical difference between these two ways of acting: in the
latter, but not the former, she should hold onto the ticket and check, when the winning
number is announced, to see whether her ticket is a winner. That is the rational course of
action for a lottery player to take, given her preferences (she has, after all, bothered to obtain
a ticket!). Because she should not ignore or discard the ticket prior to the announcement of
the winning number, her bare belief that the ticket is a loser is not Actionable, and she is thus
unlikely to be ascribed knowledge that the ticket is a loser despite the overwhelming odds
and her awareness of those odds.
147. Criminal law typically concerns deviations from salient moral norms. Nonetheless,
morally neutral and morally positive norm-deviation cases are worth noting because of their
implications (a) for error theories and competence theories (i.e., whether the SEE, ESEE,
and other findings are wholly attributable to blame-based motivated reasoning), and (b) for
areas of criminal law that do not mirror moral norms (e.g., malum prohibitum offenses).

BELIEF STATES IN CRIMINAL LAW

Part III examined the ways laypeople construe and ascribe belief,
knowledge, and other belief states. Broadly speaking, it demonstrated two
things. First, belief-state ascription (including knowledge ascription) is
much more dependent upon normative and pragmatic features of the agent’s
situation than legal and philosophical accounts have traditionally
assumed.148 Second, beliefs vary in kind—they can be occurrent or
dispositional, thick or thin—and laypeople’s belief-state ascription often
depends on which type of belief they assume they’re being asked about.
This Part returns to the specific ambiguities in mens rea concepts
described in Part II and examines, in light of the lay-ascription practices
outlined in Part III, how jurors are likely to resolve them. That is, it
examines how jurors are likely to construe and ascribe belief, knowledge,
and other legally relevant belief states in criminal trials. It focuses on
several areas of systematic divergence between, on the one hand, what
scholars, judges, and code drafters think mens rea terms mean and, on the
other hand, what those terms actually mean as implemented by jurors
adhering to jury instructions. After describing each divergence, this Section
explains why the divergence matters and how it might be addressed.
Finally, Section IV.E argues that current institutional mechanisms are illdesigned to note and remedy problematic mens rea instructions,
highlighting the need for further research in this area.
A. The Vanishing Distinction Between Knowledge and Recklessness
Recall the scholarly consensus concerning the difference between
knowledge and recklessness under the MPC. Knowledge that P is thought
to be an “invariant” and “purely descriptive” mental state: it requires (a)
true belief that P, plus (b) some contextually invariant level of certainty that
significantly exceeds a 50% probability assessment, (c) without regard to
any other factors.149 Even outside the MPC, this closely tracks the
conventional wisdom regarding what “knowledge” means when used in
148. This conclusion coheres with a more general discovery central to much of
experimental philosophy, namely, the pervasive impact of evaluative and pragmatic factors
on laypeople’s ascription of concepts previously thought to be less context-dependent and
evaluative and more purely descriptive. See Knobe, supra note 63 (reviewing the literature).
149. See Simons, Should the Model, supra note 7, at 189; Ferzan, supra note 24, at 252930 (distinguishing “mechanical” mens rea concepts such as purpose, knowledge, and willful
blindness under the MPC, from “evaluative” mens rea concepts such as MPC recklessness
and negligence); Simons, Understanding the Topography, supra note 41, at 248 n.51;
Gardner, supra note 42, at 725 (MPC “purpose” and “knowledge” are fully descriptive,
while “recklessness” has both descriptive and evaluative aspects); Alexander, supra note 41,

ordinary speech and thus when it appears undefined in statutes and jury
instructions, as frequently happens in federal criminal cases.150
Recklessness, on the other hand, is a “variant” and “evaluative” mental
state.151 What constitutes an “unjustifiable” (if not also a “substantial”)152
risk shifts according to normative and pragmatic aspects of the actor’s
situation—i.e., according to whether, “considering the nature and purpose
of the actor’s conduct,” taking the risky action represents a gross deviation
from reasonable standards of conduct.153
This distinction between knowledge as an invariant, descriptive mental
state and recklessness as a variant, evaluative mental state falls apart in
practice. As discussed in Part III, laypeople construe “knowledge” that P as
what one might call “practical certainty” that P, where practical certainty
means something like: “for practical purposes, certain enough that P to
make it the case that someone in the agent’s situation should act as if P.”154
In other words, laypeople treat knowledge as a contextually variant and
evaluative mental state much like recklessness.155
To review, here is how the normative and pragmatic features typically
associated with recklessness factor into knowledge ascription. Where
circumstantial evidence of mental state is a close call, and P turned out to
be true, jurors will employ the norm-violation / belief-ascription heuristic,
tending to construe the defendant as having had awareness of a risk that
P,156 and as having had a belief that P.157 Any type of belief—whether

154. See supra Section III.B.2. Interestingly, the MPC defines knowledge as to results in
terms of being “aware that it is practically certain that [one’s] conduct will cause such a
result.” MPC § 2.02(2)(b)(ii) (emphasis added). But there is no indication in the MPC’s
drafting history or the criminal theory literature that “practically certain,” as used in that
definition, refers to Actionability, as opposed to meaning “almost certain.”
155. For an overview of evolutionary game theory literature suggesting the usefulness of
such a practical concept of “knowledge,” see James Beebe, Social Functions of Knowledge
Attributions, in KNOWLEDGE ASCRIPTIONS 220 (Jessica Brown & Mikkel Gerken eds., 2012).
156. For this reason, it is unsurprising that, in a recent study, jury-eligible laypeople
tasked with matching descriptions of mental states to their proper MPC mens rea terms
mistakenly labeled negligence as recklessness 31% of the time. See Francis X. Shen et al.,
Sorting Guilty Minds, 86 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1306, 1343 (2011). They did this despite being

defendant’s mental state—rather than having to infer it from circumstantial evidence—

occurrent or dispositional, thick or thin—will suffice for knowledge so long
as it was Actionable.158
The question of whether a belief that P was Actionable can be restated as
follows: Would a reasonable person in the defendant’s situation have acted
as if P?159 The question can be fleshed out in terms of the pragmatic and
normative considerations outlined in Part III. For example, if the defendant
was forced to act as if either P or Not-P, and no alternative “hedging”
courses of action were available—e.g., if there was no time to deliberate, or
no additional evidence to obtain before deciding how to act—then the
defendant’s bare belief that P was Actionable. The reasonable person in
such a situation, believing that P, would act as if P.160 What if the defendant
had other available courses of action? In that case, moral norms will play a
decisive role in determining Actionability.161 The defendant’s belief that P
was Actionable insofar as (1) the defendant’s P-relevant action would be
moral norm-deviant in the event that P turned out to be true (i.e., in the
event the risk is borne out), and (2) the defendant had no overriding reason
(moral, prudential, or otherwise) not to simply take P as settled and act as if
P.162 Where P then turns out to be true—i.e., where the risk of which the
defendant was aware is borne out—the defendant was both reckless and
knowing. Virtually the same considerations determined both attributions.163
What role, then, does the defendant’s degree of subjective certainty
actually play in determining whether he possessed knowledge or instead
were to be matched. Id. at 1330-33. In the face of even a small amount of ambiguity
concerning whether the defendant was aware of the risk, people can be expected to resolve
the ambiguity in favor of a finding of awareness, even where the action at issue represented
only a trivial, non-criminal norm-deviation. See id. at 1330 (providing the language used to
signify negligence in the study’s vignettes, such as “carelessly,” “wasn’t paying attention,”
and “hurriedly”); supra Section III.A.1.

role. See supra notes 69-70, 146-47 and accompanying text.

such requirement. Compare MPC § 2.02(2)(c) with id. § 2.02(2)(b).

mere belief? Degree of subjective certainty is important only insofar as it
bears on Actionability. Any requisite certainty threshold for knowledge, if
there is one, depends on context (e.g., normative and pragmatic factors,
type of belief primed) and can get at least as low as 50%.164
But, one might object, surely jury instructions convey a different “legal
definition” that distinguishes knowledge from recklessness and renders
jurors’ prior natural language-based understanding irrelevant. Not so. Many
federal instructions offer no definition of “knowledge.”165 And under the
MPC, recall the open questions concerning what counts as a “substantial
and unjustifiable” risk that P (for recklessness), as opposed to a “high
probability” that P or a “practical certainty” that P (for knowledge). The
terms “substantial,” “high,” and even “practical,” are heavily contextsensitive, as shown not only by commonsense reflection on ordinary
language but also empirical linguistic research.166 Such vague directives
leave jurors to construe the term “knowledge” in court much as they do out
of court, which is to say, in a way that reflects the sorts of pragmatic and
normative considerations that recklessness tracks. Indeed, they are told to
do nothing to the contrary. For this reason it is no surprise that, in a recent
study, jury-eligible laypeople tasked with matching descriptions of mental
states to their proper MPC mens rea terms, even when provided the MPC’s
164. To be clear, I do not mean to imply that laypeople will always or typically think in
such numerical terms without prompting, nor that they will typically think in terms that are
reducible to numerical probabilities without losing important information potentially bearing
on the defendant’s culpability.
Moreover, where thick belief is primed, laypeople may even allow the probability
sufficient for a belief that fulfills knowledge’s belief requirement to, in effect, dip below
50%. That is, laypeople might think a thick belief that goes against the evidence—even in
the defendant’s own estimation—is nonetheless Actionable, especially where the belief in
question is perceived to be a useful or morally praiseworthy belief to have. See Sackris &
Beebe, supra note 128, at 175-87 (reporting experiments in which subjects ascribed
knowledge to (1) a father who, despite overwhelming evidence against his daughter, believes
she did not commit a crime, and (2) a husband who, despite the evidence against his wife’s
prospects for surviving cancer, believes she will survive). But see Husak & Callender, supra
note 8, at 38-39 (reasoning that awareness of a less than 50% chance that P entails “actual
belief” that Not-P).

mens rea definitions, fared only slightly better than chance at distinguishing
knowledge from recklessness, and indeed, chose “knowledge” more often
than “recklessness” when recklessness was the correct answer.167 In
practice, there is virtually no difference between recklessness and
knowledge.
This lack of difference matters for at least three reasons. First, since
“knowledge” in criminal law is a more capacious category than the
conventional wisdom suggests, laypeople likely “over”-ascribe knowledge
to criminal defendants. That is, laypeople ascribe knowledge in more cases
than would be warranted on the more lofty, rarefied understanding of
knowledge assumed in the scholarly literature, MPC commentaries, and
case law, and they do so while adhering to current jury instructions.
Second, a prosecutor’s decision to charge a defendant with a crime
requiring knowledge, as opposed to a crime requiring recklessness, can
drastically increase the defendant’s punishment without any corresponding
difference in the actual underlying mental state the jury will be asked to
ascribe. For example, in Colorado, an MPC jurisdiction, a knowing
homicide carries a mandatory sentence of between sixteen and forty-eight

167. See Shen et al., supra note 156, at 1343 (reporting that subjects: (a) correctly labeled
instances of knowledge only 50% of the time, inaccurately labeling them as “reckless” 30%
of the time; and (b) correctly labeled instances of recklessness only 40% of the time,
inaccurately labeling them knowledge 42% of the time); id. at 1346 n.94 (noting that “[i]t is
not the purpose of this Article to explore the many reasons why subjects might have
difficulty at this K/R boundary”). Study participants fared better in distinguishing negligence
from recklessness and were much more accurate in sorting other mental states. Id. at 1343
(reporting 78% and 88% accuracy rates in matching “purposely” and “blameless” vignettes,
respectively, with their proper MPC definition). In a follow-up study, “[r]educing the
communicated probability (e.g., from ‘very likely’ to ‘some risk’ and from ‘likelihood’ to
‘real risk’)” in the study vignettes’ descriptions of reckless protagonists’ mental state,
“improved the ability of participants to accurately identify the mental state”—i.e., to match it
to the correct MPC definition. Matthew R. Ginther et. al., The Language of Mens Rea, 67
VAND. L. REV. 1327, 1356 (2014). Still, the authors write,
Even in our best case, only 59% of subjects are accurately identifying
R[ecklessness] scenarios. . . . About 70% of these misidentifications are
subjects believing that a[] R[ecklessness] scenario demonstrates knowing
conduct on the part of the protagonist. We are still left with the basic
conclusion we reached in the original study: laypeople have great difficulty
identifying and distinguishing reckless and knowing behavior.

years,168 while a reckless homicide carries a non-mandatory sentence of two
to six years.169
Third, for legislatures drafting criminal codes and judges deciding which
mental state to read into statutes that fail to specify a mens rea, the choice
between knowledge and recklessness typically makes little difference to the
guilt/innocence determination under the current jury-instruction regime.
Drawing the line at knowledge, rather than recklessness, is in this respect
more arbitrary and inconsequential than has been previously assumed.170
Unfortunately, while the mental state these terms invoke may not differ in
practice, the consequences for defendants at the sentencing stage may be
great, presumably owing to legislatures’ or courts’ failure, when
determining appropriate sentences, to appreciate the lack of difference in
the underlying mental states.171
If the current distinction between recklessness and knowledge is
problematic, there are two broad ways criminal law might address the
problem: abandon the distinction or salvage it. Abandoning the distinction
would be relatively easy to implement. Salvaging the distinction is more
difficult, in that it calls for some sort of clarification in jury instructions
concerning knowledge. One way would be to explicitly quantify the degree
168. COLO. REV. STAT. §§ 18-3-103(1), 18-3-103(3)(a), 18-1.3-406 (2015).
169. Id. §§ 18-3-104, 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A).
170. The Supreme Court recently examined the applicable mens rea for the federal
statute criminalizing threats of violence. See Elonis v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2001 (2015).
The statute at issue was silent as to mens rea. The Court reasoned that negligence was
insufficient for conviction under the statute, but the Court did not reach the question of
whether recklessness would suffice or whether instead knowledge or purpose was required.
Id. at 2017. In a partial dissent, Justice Alito criticized the majority’s decision not to specify
the correct mens rea, noting “regrettable consequences” of the Court’s incrementalism. Id. at
2014 (Alito, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (“If purpose or knowledge is
needed and a district court instructs the jury that recklessness suffices, a defendant may be
wrongly convicted. On the other hand, if recklessness is enough, . . . a guilty defendant may
go free.”). Justice Thomas’s dissent implies that the majority coalition could not agree on
whether recklessness should suffice where a statute is silent. See id. at 2028 (Thomas, J.,
dissenting) (“Given the majority’s ostensible concern for protecting innocent actors, one
would have expected it to announce a clear rule—any clear rule. Its failure to do so reveals
the fractured foundation upon which today’s decision rests.”). In short, the Court couldn’t
reach consensus concerning whether recklessness sufficed or whether conviction under the
statute instead required knowledge, a debate that is likely to persist in the coming years as
lower courts decide which mens rea requirement to impose where federal statutes are silent.
171. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 544 F.3d 781, 786 (7th Cir. 2008) (concluding that
the Armed Career Criminal Act’s enhanced penalties are triggered by a mens rea of
knowledge but not recklessness).

541

of subjective certainty necessary for a belief to count as knowledge—say,
90% certainty.172 This would make knowledge a less variant and evaluative
mental state. It would also force jurors to consider belief in the probabilistic
terms in which legal scholars typically describe it, rather than the thick type
of belief that factual circumstances sometimes prime jurors to consider. In
both of these respects, knowledge would be more effectively distinguished
from recklessness than it currently is.173
In the end, one’s preference for keeping and clarifying the distinction or
instead for eliminating it properly depends on a host of normative
considerations beyond merely the difficulty, and current failure, in
effectively distinguishing the two concepts. In that vein, a cautionary note
is in order concerning how to approach the relevant normative
considerations.
Some might be tempted to base their preferred solution on whether they
endorse a competence or instead an error theory as an explanation for the
findings reported in Part III. At least, the literature concerning the SEE
showed such an inclination. Recall that in the SEE literature, competence
theorists, who believe that the SEE reveals something about the concept of
intentionality, of causality, etc., (rather than about the infiltration of bias
and motivated reasoning), seemed apt to recommend that the law more
closely track lay-judgments of intentionality and causality.174 In other
words, competence theorists said, “now that we better understand what
intentionality is (or what causal responsibility is, or whatever), let’s make
sure that where the law invokes these concepts, it uses them in accordance
with what we’ve discovered to be their true meaning.”
Error theorists, on the other hand, who think that the SEE is evidence of
motivated reasoning or some other cognitive defect, proposed that law
ought to seek to eliminate such biases in an effort to maintain the pure
descriptiveness of concepts like intentionality and causality.175 That is, error
theorists looked at the data and said, “now that we better understand what’s
getting in the way of laypeople accurately applying the concept of
intentionality (or causal responsibility, or whatever), let’s make sure that
when the law invokes these concepts, it takes pains to prevent laypeople’s

172. C.f. Simons, Should the Model, supra note 7, at 183 (making a similar proposal on

example, jurors may have trouble applying probability percentages.

[Vol. 68:497

prejudices from getting in the way of their accurately applying these
concepts.”
My cautionary note is that this method of reasoning moves too hastily
from the descriptive to the normative.176 It focuses too strictly on
conceptual analysis—on making sure that the law tracks a given term,
whatever that term turns out to mean—at the expense of the underlying
normative considerations that should be driving the analysis.177 In the end,
whether the ESEE, along with the other findings discussed in Part III,
reveals something about a given belief state properly understood, or instead
reveals something about how laypeople misconstrue or misapply that
belief-state concept, the bottom-line normative issue is whether the
outcomes in criminal trials—and thus in some sense the law itself—match
up with the proper aims of criminal law.
B. A Peculiar Difference Between Willful Ignorance and Knowledge
What little is left of the distinction between recklessness and knowledge
has important implications for ongoing debates concerning the relation
between “willful ignorance” and “knowledge,” and the propriety of
allowing willful ignorance to satisfy statutory knowledge requirements.
Willful ignorance has two broad requirements: “(1) the defendant must
subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and (2)
the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.”178
The “deliberate action” may be as minimal as “a cutting off of one’s normal
curiosity by an effort of will.”179 A paradigmatic example of a willfully
176. For this reason, an ultimate conclusion as to whether to keep or discard the
distinction between knowledge and recklessness is outside the scope of this Article. But if
that is so, then why bother discussing the error versus competence theory divide at all? In
part, as indicated, simply to head off a problematic means of reasoning through the
normative implications of the theories discussed in Part III. But also because, for those who
favor maintaining the distinction between knowledge and recklessness, the choice of an error
or a competence theory may rightly impact the means they propose for clarifying the
distinction. By highlighting the merits of a competence theory, this Article seeks to broaden
the discussion of solutions—which, in similar debates, sometimes assumes an error theory
and then gestures toward difficult “de-biasing” mechanisms—to include a relatively simple,
if only partial, solution: altering jury instructions in the hopes that people will follow them.
177. To be sure, lay-usage, along with conceptual analysis that tracks it, can be highly
relevant to a host of important issues (e.g., statutory interpretation, fair notice, crafting
implementable legal rules, etc.). My point here is simply that such analysis is less relevant to
the more fundamental question of what criminal law ought to prohibit in the first place.

179. United States v. Giovannetti, 919 F.2d 1223, 1229 (7th Cir. 1990). The MPC, which
does not define willful ignorance as separate from knowledge, does not require the

ignorant defendant is the drug “mule” who, despite her curiosity, fails to
check the contents of the briefcase she is paid to transport.180
Most scholars distinguish willful ignorance from knowledge,181 often
deeming it a species of recklessness.182 But in doing so, despite purporting
to track lay-usage or the legal meaning of the concept of knowledge, they
appeal to supposedly intuitive concepts of knowledge that track neither.183
Husak and Callender, for example, note (quite plausibly) that “[i]n most
cases, the (sincere) wilfully ignorant defendant would admit that he
believes p, but would deny that he knows p.”184 But they then proceed “on
the assumption that knowledge consists of some kind of externally justified
true belief,” and reason that “[t]he foremost question in deciding . . .
whether the willfully ignorant defendant possesses genuine knowledge, is
whether his belief in the incriminating proposition is justified.”185 In the
end, they conclude that willful ignorance is distinct from knowledge:
“Many wilfully ignorant defendants will lack sufficient justification for p,
and thus will not know p.”186 The problem with this sort of approach is that
it stresses “justification”—a necessary condition for knowledge under

“deliberate action” prong, and adds a requirement that the defendant not “actually believe[]”
that the inculpatory proposition is not true. MPC § 2.02(7). Some non-MPC instructions
further require that the defendant’s ignorance was the product of the defendant’s desire to
escape legal liability. See, e.g., United States v. Willis, 277 F.3d 1026, 1031-32 (8th Cir.
2002).

traditional philosophical accounts,187 but one that plays little role in
laypeople’s knowledge ascriptions and appears nowhere in jury
instructions.188 Much scholarly discussion of willful ignorance—concerning
both whether it is the same as knowledge and, if not, whether it is as
culpable as knowledge189—is similarly premised on conceptions of
knowledge that are out of sync with how laypeople understand the term and
how jury instructions define it.190
Putting those issues aside, it is still true that willful ignorance can be
distinguished from knowledge. For example, if the defendant has no belief
that P, then he does not know that P and can be reckless or willfully
ignorant with respect to P without knowing that P.191 But if the presence or

188. See Beebe, supra note 155 (providing empirical evidence that, for example,
laypeople ascribe knowledge to holders of true beliefs that were formed through
hallucination, or that study participants themselves judge as going against the evidence of
which the agent was aware). Nor is it clear that the question of whether one’s true belief was
justified should play a role in the relevant culpability determinations. Whereas subjective
certainty concerning a risk is typically, and rightly, thought to bear on culpability, epistemic
justification bears on it, if at all, only much more indirectly. On the culpability “grading
function” of subjective certainty, see Simons, Statistical Knowledge, supra note 23, at 15-16.
189. See, e.g., Charlow, supra note 27, at 1417-18; cf. Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.
SEB S.A., 131 S. Ct. 2060, 2069 (2011) (“The traditional rationale for this doctrine is that
defendants who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual
knowledge.”).
190. See, e.g., sources cited supra notes 7-8. Likewise, in explaining why willful
ignorance is or is not a form of knowledge, the literature often employs arguments that
assume normative and pragmatic factors play no proper role in knowledge ascription. See,
e.g., ALEXANDER & FERZAN, supra note 14, at 34 (stating as a premise that, “If a similar risk
imposition would not be deemed ‘knowing’ if undertaken for good reasons . . . then it is
misguided to deem the risk imposition ‘knowing’ merely because one disapproves of the
reasons for undertaking it”); Husak & Callender, supra note 8, at 51 (analogizing between
two instances of awareness with less than full certainty—only one of which is accompanied
by an easy means of obtaining greater certainty—and assuming that the availability of a
means of obtaining more certainty is irrelevant to whether the actor’s mental state counts as
knowledge).
191. Of course, that may be relatively rare, at least in close cases, given laypeople’s
belief-ascription practices—namely, (1) the norm-deviation / belief-ascription heuristic, and
(2) the numerous degrees and types of belief that can support knowledge ascription. Cf.
Husak & Callender, supra note 7, at 42 (“In most cases, the (sincere) wilfully ignorant
defendant would admit that he believes p”); MPC § 2.02(7) cmt. 9, at 248 (describing
“deliberate ignorance” under the MPC as involving “the case of the actor who is aware of
the probable existence of a material fact”) (emphasis added).

states would be the same as the debate over the relative culpability of
knowledge and recklessness. What else might distinguish willful ignorance
from knowledge in the typical case, where both mental states involve belief
in the inculpatory proposition?192
This Article’s analysis highlights an additional factor distinguishing
some cases of willful blindness from knowledge: the availability of a
salient, cheap alternative course of action—e.g., checking inside the
briefcase—in the case of willful blindness but not in the case of knowledge.
For example, as discussed above in Part III, the drug mule who feels 60%
certain there are drugs in the easy-to-open briefcase should not treat as
settled her belief that “there are drugs in the briefcase” but rather should act
on her more nuanced belief that “there is a 60% chance there are drugs in
the briefcase.”193 There is a real practical difference between the two: the
latter belief dictates that she look inside the briefcase, while the former
dictates treating the matter as settled and deciding whether to transport
drugs.194 In other words, the ease with which the prototypical willfully
ignorant actor could obtain additional information makes that actor’s more
nuanced probability assessment Actionable while it makes non-Actionable
her bare belief that P. Thus, in the rare instances of willful ignorance plus
belief that P but not knowledge that P, it is often the availability of an easy
means of obtaining certainty—rather than some difference in the
defendant’s subjective certainty or epistemic justification—that would
prevent the defendant’s belief that P from being deemed knowledge that P.
This distinguishing factor highlights one type of case in which a willful
ignorance instruction would mean the difference between a finding of
knowledge and a finding of no knowledge. It may also help focus the
inquiry concerning the relative culpability of knowledge and willful
ignorance. Ongoing scholarly debate on that topic might fruitfully address
what it is about having an available means of obtaining certainty that might
make a defendant more culpable at the same time it makes that defendant’s
belief less likely to constitute “knowledge.”195

reasonable investigation” plays a critical role in those cases in which willful ignorance is as
culpable as knowledge).

C. Implicit, and Outcome-Determinative, Differences in “Belief” and Its
Relatives
Now consider the issue of criminal law’s treatment of “belief,” along
with related belief-state concepts such as “awareness,” “conscious
disregard,” and “failure to perceive,” which are invoked throughout the
MPC, the federal code, and jury instructions in both types of jurisdiction.196
Recall that jury instructions in MPC and federal jurisdictions typically
invoke these terms without defining them, and that commentators construe
them as denoting thin, typically dispositional, belief states.197
The empirical studies surveyed in Part III indicate that when laypeople
are not told which type of belief state is at issue, they sometimes implicitly
assume it is thick, as opposed to thin, or occurrent, as opposed to
dispositional, based on what a given factual scenario or instruction primes
them to consider.198 When legislatures and courts task juries with ascribing
a given belief-state concept—“conscious disregard,” “awareness,” “belief,”
etc.—the very same term, as it is used in the very same statutory provision,
may be systematically construed as denoting a different type of belief state
in different cases due to small differences in the factual circumstances
and/or jury instructions. This is important because some case outcomes
hinge on whether jurors implicitly construe legally relevant belief states as
thick or thin and as dispositional or occurrent.199
The difference between a finding of belief, awareness, conscious
disregard, etc., and a finding of no such belief state can be the difference
between a defendant’s being found reckless and a defendant’s being found
negligent (or innocent, where negligence is not criminalized).200 But it can
also be the difference between knowledge and negligence (or between
knowledge and innocence). Indeed, where a notion of thick belief or
occurrent belief is primed, it may actually be easier to show that a
defendant knew that P than to show that the defendant believed that P:
laypeople may implicitly think the defendant had a thin, but not a thick
belief, or had a dispositional, but not occurrent belief, and hence find
knowledge (which can be found so long as any type of belief is present)

while simultaneously finding no belief (as they understand the concept in
context).201 While legislators and judges may assume that by implementing
a knowledge requirement, they are invoking a belief state that will be less
readily ascribed than “mere” belief, that will not always be the case. Once
again, knowledge is in some ways a less stringent and more variant
requirement than more traditional legal and philosophical accounts would
have it, in part because the law is not clear about what type of belief must
underlie it.
If the status quo is problematic because the “wrong” type of belief is
sometimes primed,202 what is to be done? Jury instructions could clarify
what type of belief is at issue in a given trial, at least where the “wrong”
type is otherwise likely to be primed. The statutes on which those
instructions are based could do likewise.203 Of course, insofar as the
recommendation is to clarify jury instructions or statutes, a natural next
question is: What is the “right” kind of belief for criminal law to specify?
This question once again should not be answered by recourse to an error
theory or a competence theory and a focus on some singularly “true”
meaning of “belief,” “awareness,” etc. Instead, it turns on complex
normative considerations outside this Article’s scope.204 But by staying
201. See supra Section III.B.1.b.
202. The status quo may also be problematic on grounds of fair notice, consistency of
implementation, vagueness and consequent prosecutorial discretion, and other problems
familiar in contexts where criminal law’s prohibitions are ambiguous. Cf. J. Kelly Strader,
(Re)Conceptualizing Insider Trading Law, 80 Brooklyn L. Rev. 1, 4 (2015) (noting that
vague mens rea elements raise “two basic due process concerns: denying potential
defendants fair notice and emboldening prosecutors to push the law beyond established
boundaries”).
203. That is, legislatures or code drafters might specify what they mean by the various
belief state terms they use, at least along the axes of occurrent versus dispositional and thick
versus thin. They might do this in the language of the statute itself, or through examples
found in official commentaries, similar to the “Illustrations” often found in Restatements of
the Law. The use of such illustrations, rather than language in the statutory provision itself,
might prove necessary insofar as the legislature intends for the type of belief at issue to be
different in different factual circumstances. In any event, clarification by the legislature
would help address fair notice and related concerns mentioned supra note 202.
204. Of course, that is not to say that there aren’t some readily apparent trade-offs
involved, whatever conclusion one ultimately draws. Consider, for example, whether
awareness should be construed as occurrent or merely dispositional. A construal of
awareness as merely dispositional risks undermining the distinction between knowledge and
recklessness on the one hand and negligence on the other. But a construal of awareness as
occurrent might unduly restrict the scope of knowledge and recklessness, and in any event
gives rise to difficulties in specifying the time at which the defendant must have had the
occurrent state.

silent on the matter, current jury instructions leave the issue up to whatever
type of belief, awareness, etc., the case happens to have primed. At the very
least, the type that is primed is not always the type that commentators
advocate employing or presume is already being employed in criminal
cases.205 Moreover, although more research must be done to determine
more precisely what sorts of instruction wording and factual circumstance
prime given types of belief, the studies surveyed in Part III evince patterns
that, even at this early stage, make some instances of unintended priming
predictable and potentially addressable.206
D. The Vanishing Distinction Between Description and Judgment
One broader divergence between mens rea theory and practice warrants
mention. An oft-recited piece of conventional wisdom in criminal law
theory is that “[m]odern criminal law codes . . . tend to make greater use of
purely ‘descriptive’ criteria, relative to ‘evaluative’ criteria,” in their mens
rea schemas than did older criminal codes.207 As Alan C. Michaels explains,
“descriptive” mens rea standards “identify the grounds for liability and
include those grounds in terms that do not require normative judgment for

205. See supra Part II. For example, as a general matter it seems unlikely that judges,
commentators, or legislators would endorse a thick or occurrent construal of belief,
awareness, conscious disregard, etc., in any case in which a jury would thereby find that the
defendant was not reckless (because he lacked the relevant type of belief) but was knowing
(because he possessed some other type of belief). See supra notes 101-02 and accompanying
text (noting the supposed incoherence of a finding of knowledge that P without belief that
P); supra note 12 and accompanying text (noting the assumption that greater culpability
attaches to knowledge than to “mere” recklessness).
206. See supra Section III.B.1.b. It is worth stressing that here, as elsewhere in this
Article, one possible alternative normative response to jury instruction ambiguity would be
to embrace it. Perhaps in each case jurors will tend to settle on the meaning of the term at
issue that, given the specific facts of the case, more closely tracks culpability than would
more precise mental state categories devised ex ante. This sort of response, familiar in
debates over the desirable degree of specificity in criminal law’s prohibitions, runs into the
problems of fair notice, etc., noted supra note 202. It is also problematic insofar as the jury
lacks information about, or ability to tailor, the defendant’s lkely punishment, and is instead
required to make a binary guilt or innocence decision concerning each charged offense.

their application.”208 In contrast, evaluative, or “judgmental,” mens rea
standards “define criminal liability in plainly indeterminate terms that call
for appraisals, assessments, or judgments beyond findings of fact.”209
Within the MPC, for example, recklessness and negligence are thought to
retain some of the common law’s reliance on evaluation,210 while
“[p]urpose and knowledge are fully descriptive,” as is the “‘substantial risk’
component of the recklessness criterion.”211
This conventional account of a modern trend toward description and
away from evaluation is somewhat misleading. “Knowledge,” for example,
held up as a paradigmatic example of an objective, value-neutral, and acontextual belief state on both legal and philosophical accounts,212 turns out
instead to be like recklessness: the very same mental events can be
knowledge or not knowledge depending on the moral valence of the actions
to which they are relevant and the pragmatic context in which the action
takes place. The same may be said for other supposedly non-evaluative
mental states invoked in current jury instructions.213
The point here is not that modern mens rea remains evaluative because
jurors engage in blame-based motivated reasoning that gets in the way of
their following directions. Quite to the contrary, the point is that modern
criminal codes, and jury instructions based on them, do not instruct jurors to
employ non-evaluative concepts. Instead, current instructions employ
concepts like “knowledge,” and descriptions like “high probability” that, on

their most natural lay-interpretation, turn out to be both descriptive and
evaluative.214
E. The Need for Greater Scrutiny of Mens Rea Jury Instructions
Before concluding, this Article highlights three potential reasons why
mens rea jury instructions and their interpretation have received relatively
little attention to date, along with explanations for why each reason is
misguided.
First, even if one is convinced that problematic ambiguities lurk within
mens rea jury instructions, one might still think that careful scrutiny of jury
instructions is unimportant because jurors are too biased or incompetent to
respond to changes in jury instructions. This objection is overblown. The
studies reviewed in Part III, along with numerous other social scientific
studies, show that jury-eligible laypeople’s belief-state ascriptions are
responsive to small changes in wording, and that their belief-state
ascriptions are largely constrained by instructions and not simply the
product of irrational, “blame early”-style motivated reasoning.215 Moreover,
even though irrational bias likely influences mental-state ascription to some
degree, alteration of misleading jury instructions represents a simpler and
more immediate reform than the sort of “de-biasing” efforts sometimes
gestured at in the legal literature on criminal law and psychology.216
One might nonetheless suggest a second set of reasons for why scrutiny
of mens rea jury instructions is not so pressing: perhaps legal institutions
already ensure reasonably well-functioning and ever-improving jury
214. This point is important not only for accurately describing current law, but also for
determining whether or how to implement various proposals for criminal law reform. See,
e.g., Youngjae Lee, Reasonable Doubt and Moral Elements, 105 J. CRIM. L. &
CRIMINOLOGY (forthcoming 2016) (arguing that “the beyond a reasononable doubt
requirement should not apply to moral or normative elements” of crimes but should continue
to apply to purely descriptive elements of crimes).
215. Of course, criminal trials differ in important respects from social science
experiments like the ones described in this Article, which, for example, do not involve group
deliberation. This does not mean, however, that they fail to predict juror behavior. See
generally Jonathan J. Koehler & John B. Meixner, Jury Simulation Goals, in THE
PSYCHOLOGY OF JURIES: CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE
(Margaret Bull Kovera ed., forthcoming 2016).
216. See, e.g., Nadelhoffer, Bad Acts, supra note 2, at 211-12 (suggesting that “[p]erhaps,
if jurors were made aware of the various—and seemingly predictable—ways that their
judgments can be unwittingly affected by evaluative considerations and blame-validation
biasing, they would be better able to live up to their legal duty to base their decisions solely
on the material facts of the case,” though noting that such reform would face serious
difficulties).

2016]

BELIEF STATES IN CRIMINAL LAW

instructions without the need for an account of laypeople’s belief-state
ascription practices. After all, confused jurors can ask clarifying questions.
Lawyers can propose alternative instructions if they are concerned that
jurors’ implicit understanding of belief state terms will hurt their client.
Appellate judges can correct and refine over time the instructions lower
courts provide. More generally, if jury instructions were really giving a
systematically different impression than judges and commentators thought
they gave, then the resulting false negatives and false positives in jury
findings would function as “red flags,” alerting us to the problem.217
Perhaps the absence of such red flags in the mens rea context means there is
no problem in the first place.
Unfortunately, current institutional mechanisms do not warrant such an
optimistic view. Jurors might not consciously consider the ways they are
resolving ambiguities in mental-state descriptions, and they are even less
likely to note how their resolutions of such ambiguities depart from those of
legal commentators.218 Lawyers, insofar as they are aware of the sorts of
subtle ambiguities noted in Part III, are unlikely to successfully propose
instructions that stray far from typical instructions, and even if they do, the
resulting instruction will in no way bind, or likely even influence, other
judges’ instructions. Moreover, even systematically “inaccurate” mens rea
ascription will not raise red flags; it is exceedingly difficult to show that a
jury in any given case got the actus reus finding right but the mens rea
finding wrong. Hence no evidence of false positives—no red flags—will
draw attention to systematically problematic mens rea instructions, even as
studies of exonerations reveal ways actus reus determinations can go
systematically awry.
As for appellate review, it ensures that jury instructions do not misstate
the law,219 but it does not ensure optimal jury instructions,220 and in fact
217. A parallel might be drawn to the way false positive guilty verdicts have led to
critical examination of pre-trial line-ups and interrogations. Cf. Robert P. Burns, Some
Limitations of Experimental Psychologists’ Criticisms of the American Trial, 90 CHI.-KENT
L. REV. 899 (2015).
218. Nor could jurors likely craft an effective clarifying question, especially given
judges’ understandable hesitancy to wade into thorny and unsettled legal issues in response
to a jury’s mid-deliberation questions.
219. That said, where counsel fails to lodge an objection to a given instruction, a
misstatement of the law will only be overturned on appeal if it was not harmless. See, e.g.,
United States v. Khan, 53 F.3d 507, 516-17 (2d Cir. 1995).
220. Indeed, appellate courts sometimes strongly support the use of particular wording in
jury instructions while nonetheless not overturning convictions based on instructions that
failed to include it, even without engaging in harmless error analysis. For example, in Jewell,

552

OKLAHOMA LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 68:497

further ensures that instructions will remain minimally error-prone and
hence less than fully explanatory.221 For better or worse, the process of
jury-instruction creation and review ensures cautious instructions that are
highly path-dependent—an amalgam of statements that happen to have
been reviewed and not found erroneous by the relevant appellate court.
In short, current institutional mechanisms are ill-designed to note and
remedy problematic mens rea jury instructions, suggesting all the more
strongly the need for further research in this area. For now, the upshot of
the current system of jury-instruction creation and review is to put pressure
on legislatures. Their definition of a given mental state must be aimed not
only at judges but also at jurors, who will often receive minimal-to-no
guidance beyond the statutory term itself and any statutory definitions.
A third and final objection to this Article’s focus on jury instructions is
more theoretical. Perhaps, in setting out to understand what belief state
concepts “mean” as they are used in criminal mens rea analysis, this
Article’s focus on jury instructions and their interpretation is incomplete or
misleading. After all, jury instructions can get the law wrong, and even
those that get the law right can still be misinterpreted, maybe even
systematically so. The very possibility of incorrect instructions or mistaken
interpretation implies that there is some “legal meaning” of these mens rea
concepts that can differ from what reasonable jurors, faithfully applying
instructions, would understand these terms to mean.
This objection highlights an interesting and under-theorized issue: How
do jurors and jury instructions fit into debates about the content of the law,
as well as the relation between the content of the law and the
the Ninth Circuit upheld a willful ignorance instruction, stressing the importance of the
phrase “solely and entirely a result of”—as used in the phrase “[you may convict if his]
ignorance . . . was solely and entirely the result of . . . a conscious purpose to disregard” the
possibility that he was transporting narcotics—as a bulwark against a conviction for mere
recklessness. United States v. Jewell, 532 F.2d 697, 704 n.21 (9th Cir. 1976) (en banc). But,
as Judge Sand notes in his influential treatise on federal jury instructions, after Jewell it is
still “not clear whether this language is ever required, even in the Ninth Circuit,” which
appears never to have reversed a conviction “for the failure to include it.” SAND ET AL.,
supra note 50, at 7. Similarly, in articulating the proper mens rea for aiding and abetting in
Rosemond, the Supreme Court at times invoked the defendant’s “full knowledge” and “full
awareness,” but there is no indication that these phrases were meant to, or will, show up in
future jury instructions concerning aiding and abetting. See Rosemond v. United States, 134
S. Ct. 1240, 1248-50 (2014).
221. Cf. United States v. Aguilar, 80 F.3d 329, 331 (9th Cir. 1996) (warning that on
review, the appellate court will “carefully” review any attempt at defining “knowledge,” and
that “[a]lthough a correct instruction may assist jurors in understanding knowledge,” “[t]he
district court is not necessarily required to define knowledge”).

communicative content of legal texts?222 Delving into that issue would,
however, take us far afield. For this Article’s purposes, it is enough to note
the ways in which mens rea belief state concepts, as they are understood
and applied by fact-finders in criminal trials, differ from the concepts that
judges presume are operative, and that scholars use in their descriptive
accounts and normative proposals concerning mens rea. Which account of
mens rea belief-state concepts might more properly be labeled an account
of the “true legal meaning” of those terms is, for present purposes, beside
the point.
V. Conclusion
This Article began with a simple question: What do legally relevant
belief states consist of? Focusing on criminal law, its method of answering
that question has been to examine jury instructions and jurors’ likely
interpretation and application of them in the face of circumstantial evidence
of mental state.223 Drawing on empirical research previously overlooked in
the legal literature, this Article helps fill a gap in our understanding of
legally relevant belief states, revealing several important divergences
between theory and practice.
As a general matter, belief-state ascription is much more responsive to
the perceived practical and normative aspects of an agent’s situation than
has traditionally been assumed. The amount of evidence one must have in
order to be taken to have formed a belief that P, and the amount of certainty
needed to make that belief knowledge, depend on what courses of action
were available to the agent, as well as how counter-normative the agent’s Prelevant action was. Moreover, concepts like belief, awareness, and
conscious disregard can mean quite different things in different contexts.
As a result, supposedly legally irrelevant factual differences and slight
alterations in jury-instruction wording systematically prime jurors to

222. Cf. Lawrence B. Solum, Communicative Content and Legal Content, 89 NOTRE
DAME L. REV. 479, 479 (2013) (drawing a distinction between “communicative content” and
“legal content,” arguing that the relationship between the two “varies with context; different
kinds of legal texts produce different relationships between linguistic meaning and legal
rules,” and discussing constitutions, statutes, judicial opinions, and contracts, but not jury
instructions).
223. Though outside the scope of this Article, a similar approach has interesting
implications for other areas of law in which belief state ascription plays an important role,
such as criminal procedure, torts, contracts, and statutory interpretation.

consider occurrent or dispositional and “thick” or “thin” forms of the
concepts in question, ultimately altering case outcomes.
As an initial step toward understanding what belief-state terms mean in
practice, this Article should help clarify what is at stake in, and how best to
implement, various proposals for mens rea reform. Its overarching
implication is that jury instructions deserve closer scrutiny and empirical
testing than has previously been undertaken. Growing appreciation for the
biases that infect the criminal trial process should not blind us to the
possibility that relatively minor adjustments to jury instructions could
positively affect outcomes in a multitude of criminal cases, bringing mens
rea concepts more in line not only with what we have assumed they do
mean, but also with what we suggest they should mean.
