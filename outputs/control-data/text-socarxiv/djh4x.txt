ABSTRACT
Objectives. This study describes the development and validation the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale
(MPNS-36) which measures the extent to which females’ menstrual practices and environments
meet their needs.
Methods. A 54-item pool was developed following systematic-review of qualitative and quantitative
studies and expert feedback. Item reduction and scale validation were undertaken using a crosssectional survey of 538 menstruating schoolgirls in Soroti, Uganda. Test-retest reliability was
assessed in a sub-sample of 52 girls two weeks after the first administration. Construct validity was
tested through relationships with hypothesised correlates: confidence to manage menses, selfreported school absenteeism, and mental health symptoms.
Results. The final MPNS-36 comprises 28 items applicable to all respondents, and 8 items capturing
washing and drying experiences for those reusing menstrual materials. A four-factor solution for the
core 28 items was the best fit for the data (RMSEA=0.028-0.029; CFI=0.961-0.964; TFI=0.957-0.959),
supplemented by two factors for reuse (RMSEA=0.021-0.030; CFI=0.987-0.994; TFI=0.981-0.991).
Subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores to support accessibility for practitioners.
Subscales were ‘material and home environment needs’ (11 items, αordinal=0.84), ‘transport and
school environment needs’ (5-items, αordinal=0.73), ‘material reliability concerns’ (3-items,
αordinal=0.55), ‘change and disposal insecurity’ (9-items, αordinal=0.80), ‘reuse needs’ (5-items,
αordinal=0.76), and ‘reuse insecurity’ (3-items, αordinal=0.56). Relationships between subscales and
hypothesised correlates supported validity. Home- and school-based items were more strongly
associated with confidence to manage menstruation at home and school, respectively. Higher scores
predicted not missing school during the last menstrual period (total score: OR=2.62, 95%CI=1.524.50). Test-retest reliability was moderate (total score: ICC(2,1)=0.69).
Conclusions. The MPNS-36 demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. It is the first measure to
capture women and girls perceived menstrual hygiene and may be used across a range of study
designs to assess menstrual needs. Future research should explore the suitability and sensitivity of
the measure across contexts.

INTRODUCTION
Reports of women’s and girls’ negative experiences of menstruation have led to an increasing
momentum to enact policies and programs to improve menstrual health.[1,2] A growing body of
qualitative studies have described the challenges faced during menstruation and their implications
for women’s and girl’s health and social participation.[3,4] Qualitative methods are well-suited to
capturing the nuances of menstrual experience. However, quantitative studies are often needed to
support decision making, evaluate interventions, and monitor progress. To date, quantitative studies
have struggled to engage with the complexity of menstrual experiences and have been limited by
the lack of available measures to capture core concepts.[5] Researchers have relied on study-based
questionnaires in the absence of evidence to direct question selection or provide insights on
measure reliability and validity.
This study reports on the development and validation of a new measure to capture women’s and
girls’ perceptions of their menstrual management needs. Here we describe: the identification of the
constructs targeted for assessment, the development of the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS),
and the pilot and validation of the measure in a sample of menstruating schoolgirls.
Menstrual practice needs
Establishing ways to measure menstrual hygiene has been an ongoing gap and research priority in
the study of menstrual experience and interventions.[6-8] Good menstrual hygiene was initially
defined as “women and adolescent girls using a clean menstrual management material to absorb or
collect blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of the
menstruation period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and having access to
facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials.”[9] This highlighted females’ physical
management of menses.[10-12] The term has since seen new iterations, drawing in other menstrual
needs including knowledge of the menstrual cycle and supportive socio-cultural environments free
from stigma and menstrual-related restrictions.[12-14] To capture these varied aspects, multiple
indicators with specific methods of assessment will be necessary. While the formal definitions of
menstrual hygiene and menstrual health continue to evolve, the need for measures capturing the
implicit core concepts remains unchanged.[8]
To inform our measure development efforts, we undertook a systematic review and meta-synthesis
of extant qualitative studies of women’s and girls’ menstrual experiences in low- and middle-income
countries (see [3]). We synthesised findings from 76 eligible studies to identify salient themes and
their relationships, developing an integrated model of menstrual experience. Of the identified
components of menstrual experience emerging from the review, two focused on women’s and girls’
physical management of menstrual bleeding; menstrual practices, and perceptions of menstrual
practices and environments.[3] In describing the former, authors of included studies highlighted the
range of practices undertaken to manage menses, often discussing the ways practices influenced
discomfort or health. In the review we highlighted the distinction between these behavioural
practices such as the type of material used, and individuals’ perceptions of practices adequacy,
comfort, or reliability. Perceptions reflected individual preferences and past experiences, resources,
knowledge, expectations and the norms of their socio-cultural environments.
Quantitative study of menstrual experience has frequently collected data on individuals’ menstrual
practices.[7] We would argue that practices alone are not well placed to capture individuals’
satisfaction or concerns, a frequent target for improvement in menstrual health programs. Measures
assessing the type of material used do not reveal if this material was preferred, just as those

3

capturing the quantity of materials used do not indicate if the user felt this was sufficient. Practices
may be classified as more favourable based on their associations with reproductive tract
infections,[15] but the usefulness of these categories is limited when considering program impacts
on other outcomes such as menstrual experience, psychosocial wellbeing or social participation. We
hypothesise that measures of individuals’ perceived adequacy of practices and environments are
likely to more closely align with findings from qualitative research and predict social participation
and wellbeing, as they acknowledge that the same practices may be appraised differently due to a
range of individual and sociocultural influences. We propose that quantitative assessment should
include measures of women’s perceptions along with their practices. Both approaches align with the
existing description of menstrual hygiene, which does not specify whether adequate materials,
disposal, cleanliness, or privacy are defined by investigators through top-down appraisal of
behaviours or defined by respondents’ perspectives.
Thus, in this study we aimed to develop a measure that can capture the extent to which
respondents’ current menstrual management practices and environments are perceived to meet
their needs. We restrict the measure to the practices undertaken and environments used to manage
menstrual bleeding; hypothesising that different measures will be needed to address other
constructs relating to menstrual pain or knowledge which are outside the scope of this work. To test
construct validity, we hypothesised that perceptions of menstrual practice needs would predict
lower school absenteeism due to menstruation, higher confidence to manage menstruation, and
fewer mental health symptoms, based on past qualitative research.[3]
Measurement considerations
MPNS development was informed by past research highlighting considerations for measurement
and preliminary investigations by our study team. First, past research has indicated that poor
attention to the full range of menstrual practices may provide a skewed appraisal of community
needs.[16] Further, fixation on one menstrual practice in measurement, such as the type of material
used, may lead to overemphasis on this aspect at the expense of others. The breadth of practices
undertaken was informed through systematic review of past research.[3] Practices identified for the
proposed measure were: menstrual materials used, frequency of changing materials, transportation
and storage of materials, handwashing during menstrual management, genital and body cleaning,
disposal of used materials, and methods of washing and drying materials, including access to a vessel
for holding water and the use of soap. This list is consistent with an independent qualitative study
which aimed to identify the breadth of practice challenges in India, lending further support to this
broad coverage.[12] A second consideration was informed by a preliminary study investigating the
location-dependency of menstrual practices. Through a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh, we
found that schoolgirls’ self-reported menstrual practices, such as the material used, varied between
home and school environments, as did their confidence to manage menses. These findings suggest
that self-report items with unclear locations may not adequately reflect the experiences researchers
are aiming to measure.[17] Third, in focus group discussions (FGDs) with enumerators who had
implemented Performance Monitoring and Accountability (2020) surveys [18] in Niger, participants
reported that survey respondents rarely immediately understood the intention of items asking
whether their menstrual environment was ‘private’ or ‘safe’. Enumerators frequently provided
clarifications based on their own understandings; which also differed. Findings from FGDs suggested
that ‘privacy’ and ‘safety’ as stand-alone terms may not be amenable to cross-cultural adaptation
and translation. Similar issues with the interpretation of ‘privacy’ were reported in an independent
field test of measures in Belize.[19] For questions aimed at capturing these concepts, we returned to
the qualitative studies from which they were drawn and identified worries about being seen or

4

harmed as origins of ‘privacy’ and ‘safety’ priorities. This approach aligned with a recent measure of
sanitation insecurity.[20] Finally, practitioners and researchers alike recognise the sometimes
contradictory requirements in wishing to best capture experiences and at the same time moderate
participant fatigue and survey length. Thus, the measure needed to balance length with
comprehensiveness.
In sum, grounded in past research we defined menstrual practice needs as a core construct for
measurement, and drew on past studies and preliminary research to guide item development.

METHODS
The MPNS was developed across three phases, summarised in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Phases of development of the MPNS-36
Conceptualisation
In the first phase we identified constructs for assessment through systematic reviews of past
research, assessed the need for new measures, and collated insights from the performance of past
questions. This is described in the introduction.
Instrument development
Using our systematic review of qualitative studies, we collated the menstrual practices reported, and
illustrative quotations of participants’ perceptions of their practices and environments. These were
included in the meta-synthesis report, see [3]. We also utilised the full set of studies thematically
coded in Nvivo 12 during the review, to provide an extensive set of quotations from which to draw
scale items.
Following initial item generation, we undertook an online survey of experts. We invited members of
the East and Southern Africa Menstrual Hygiene Research Network, and experts attending past MHM
in Ten [21] meetings to participate. Twenty-three experts provided feedback on a selection of 19
MPNS draft items. Participants identified as researchers (52%), practitioners (12%), or both (36%).
Experts rated the usefulness of MPNS items and were invited to make comments. One item was
removed from the pool due to poor ratings. Experts were also consulted regarding the response

5

format with 68% endorsing a 4-point Likert option. A further 14% preferred a 3-point scale, with
others suggesting dichotomous responses or responses varied by context/language.
Sixteen items, professionally translated into French, were presented to resident enumerators
following collection of Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) 2020 surveys in Niamey,
Niger. Items were presented as part of focus group discussions (FGDs) concerning the performance
of menstrual hygiene questions in PMA2020 surveys. Twenty resident enumerators from Niamey
provided feedback on the response options, with endorsement of a 4-point scale. During FGDs
enumerators indicated two potentially problematic items, suggesting that these were less likely to
be reported honestly by older adult women. These items were removed after piloting. During FGDs,
enumerators were asked for their impressions of what each item sought to capture. Their
interpretations matched our intentions for the items, supporting face validity.
Final item wording was refined during translation and back-translation of items and research
assistant training for the validation study in Uganda.
Instrument evaluation: Study sample and data collection
The target sample size was based on ten participants per item, a 10:1 ratio. A cross-sectional survey
was undertaken across 12 schools in Soroti, Uganda. Soroti is a regional urban centre in the Teso
sub-region of Eastern Uganda. Ugandan Demographic Household Survey (DHS) data from 2016
reports that 41.5% of the Teso region population places in the lowest national wealth quintile.
According to DHS, 39.2% of households had an observed hand washing location, 63.7% of females
had attended some primary school as their highest educational attainment.[22]
Schools recruited for the survey were already engaged with the partner NGO, Irise Institute East
Africa, were all government schools, and had been selected by the District Education Office as those
with the greatest need. Data were collected March-May 2019. Girls 12 years and older were
recruited from Primary (P) class levels P5-6, with expansion to P4 and P7 to achieve the required
sample size. In the previous year (October 2018), pupils in P6 received a menstrual education and
product (reusable sanitary pad) intervention. These students should have graduated to P7 by the
time of the survey. Grade repetition, school transfer, and the inclusion of some P7 students to
achieve the required sample meant some participants in this study had received an intervention 5-6
months prior to the survey.
Female research assistants, local to the area were trained to deliver the survey. Paper surveys in
English were self-completed by girls in groups of no more than six, with research assistants providing
verbal instruction and translation in Ateso. Group surveys lasted approximately 75-90 minutes.
Girls needed to be present at school and were recruited by class. If more girls were available than
could be surveyed, participants were selected using a simple randomisation technique (every third
girl across desk rows, repeated until the maximum number was met). Schools had at least two visits
for data collection. Almost all menstruating girls in participating classes were sampled to achieve the
target sample size. During the first data collection visit in the first 10 schools, one pre-selected
research assistant consented her group of up to 6 girls for re-test survey and recorded their names
next to an ID number. A reserve group of girls were also consented. Upon repeat visit, the target retest group were sought, with substitutions from the reserve group if needed.
Data were entered into Qualtrics survey system by trained research assistants. Fifty surveys, 9.29%,
were entered twice for error screening. Data entry error rate was 1.59%.

Survey content and question format
Demographics. Participants self-reported their age, class level, religion and grade repetition.
Household resources were assessed using four items from the Afrobarometer lived poverty
index,[23] indicating how often, over the past year, girls went without food, clean water, medicine
and school supplies.
Menstrual practices. A suite of questions asking girls about their menstrual practices were
asked as part of the concurrent development of the menstrual practices questionnaire (MPQ).
Behaviours were reported for the last menstrual period, consistent with MPNS items. For the
present study, we used items capturing the menstrual materials used during the last period at home,
frequency of change of menstrual materials and location of material change.
Last menstruation. We asked girls to estimate the timing of their last menstrual period in
broad terms “I have my period now”, “last week”, “within two weeks”, “within three weeks”, “one
month” or “more than one month ago”. For girls undertaking the re-test survey, those selecting the
first two options were coded as reporting on a new period.
MPNS item pool. The 54 draft items were included in the participant survey. On each page,
participants were reminded that items referred to the last menstrual period. The items took the
form of a personal statement followed by response options “never”, “sometimes”, “often”, and
“always”. Response options were accompanied by a visual tool, see Figure 2. Participants had been
familiarized with Likert responding earlier in the survey for agreement and disagreement items. The
MPNS section of the survey was preceded by an activity. Research assistants had a large version of
the visual tool and asked participants to report as a group on the frequency of a variety of school
activities. For example, “How often do you have a lunch break during the school day?”, “How often
do you have tests at school?”. The activity allowed research assistants to engage students regarding
the selected response category.

Psychological symptoms. Psychological health was assessed using a modified version of the
Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21).[24] For length, we selected only the depression and
anxiety subscales and one item was removed from each scale. We removed anxiety item “I was
aware of dryness of my mouth”, and depression item “I felt down-hearted and blue” as these were
perceived to present challenges for translation. Language was simplified for translation, for example
“I couldn’t seem to experience any positive feeling at all” was simplified to “I couldn’t experience any
positive feelings”. Participants reported how often over the past week they experienced each
statement in the list. Response options were simplified to: 0 “never”, 1 “sometimes”, 2 “often”, 3
“almost always”. For analysis we used a total symptoms score, with depression and anxiety items
transposed onto a 7-point scale to reflect the original. Total scores could range from 0 to 42.

7

Confidence to manage menstruation. Girls reported on a 4-point Likert scale from “Strongly
disagree” to “Strongly agree” their agreement with the statement “I feel confident to manage my
menstrual period at home” and “at school”. This was accompanied with a note that managing
menstruation means “collecting materials, changing, washing drying and disposing of materials
during your period”. Dichotomous responses of “confident” (agree or strongly agree) and “not
confident” (disagree or strongly disagree) were used for analyses.
School attendance. Participants self-reported if they “usually” missed school during
menstruation, providing “yes” or “no” responses. For comparison, girls reported if they missed
school during their last menstrual period “yes”, “no”, or “not applicable” if their last period did not
fall during school time.
Instrument evaluation: Analyses
Analyses were undertaken using Stata 15 and R Version 3.6.0.
Item responses were investigated through descriptive statistics. We used random split-halves of the
data to develop then test the emerging factor structure. Acknowledging the ordinal nature of the
data, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with principal axis factoring was undertaken using the
polychoric correlation matrix. We used scree plots, eigenvalues >1 (Kaiser criterion), and theoretical
plausibility as criteria against which item reduction and final factor structure were determined. We
anticipated a-priori that any emergent factors would be corelated, and specified oblique rotation,
using promax with Kaiser normalisation. To maintain content validity, we prioritised coverage of
menstrual practices before selecting items with the highest factor loadings during reduction. Items
with loadings <0.30 were considered to have poor loading. During exploratory factor analysis we
permitted cross-loading for two items which applied to both school and home settings. These were
confined to a single factor in the final model.
We explored potential predictors of missing data including class level, age, and household resources
and identified no pattern of missing data. Little’s MCAR (missing completely at random) test was
non-significant χ2=4107.57, p=0.246, further supporting our assumption that there was no pattern. A
total of 13 girls (2.4%) were missing more than 2 items on the final 28-core item measure and were
excluded from final analysis. Missing data were deleted pairwise for EFAs.
We undertook confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the lavaan package in R. Reflecting the
ordinal nature of the data, we used a robust diagonally weighted least squares estimator (DWLS).
DWLS requires complete data. Multiple imputation using chained equations with the mice package
in R was undertaken for girls with 2 or fewer missing items. As lavaan does not support multiply
imputed data with DWLS estimation, we extracted ten imputed data sets and ran the CFA on each.
We combined factor loadings using Rubin’s rules.[25] There is little guidance on combining model fit
statistics across imputations, so we provide the range of root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI).[26] We considered RMSEA ≤0.05
as indicative of close fit, with RMSEA ≤0.08 as fair fit, and CFI and TFI ≥0.95 as indicative of
acceptable model fit.(27) Final CFA structure was compared to bi-factor and hierarchical models
using model fit statistics, item loadings and theoretical plausibility.
Measurement invariance was assessed by comparing the final CFA model between girls’ who
reported using only disposable sanitary pads at home, to others. We tested for threshold and
loading invariance, using updated guidance for multi-group CFA for ordinal data.[28,29]

8

Internal consistency was computed using the polychoric, rather than Pearson, correlation matrix to
generate an ordinal alpha.[30] We also provided Cronbach’s alpha based on Pearson’s correlations
for comparison, although this has been suggested to underestimate associations in ordinal data.(30)
We prioritised capturing experiences across the breadth of menstrual practices, recognising that
measurement can bias attention towards particular practices. We also hypothesised that girls were
likely to experience varied practices and environments with different levels of acceptability. Thus, apriori, we were willing to sacrifice some degree of internal consistency for coverage. Nevertheless,
we applied a conventional αordinal≥0.70 as indicative of satisfactory reliability. Test-retest reliability
was assessed using intra class correlation coefficients (ICCs) calculated using single-measure, twoway mixed-effects models, with absolute agreement.[31] We assessed test-retest reliability
separately for girls reporting on the same or different menstrual period to their original survey.
Although guidelines on acceptable ICCs are unclear, we considered an ICC between 0.50 and 0.75 to
represent moderate reliability, and greater than 0.75 to represent good reliability.[31]
The lack of available measures for menstrual health constructs limited comparators for convergent
or divergent validity. Drawing on hypotheses from qualitative research, we tested predictive validity
though associations between the MPNS and confidence to manage menstruation, mental health and
school absenteeism. Bivariate relationships were tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficients for
continuous variables, and binary logistic regressions for dichotomous outcomes (school
absenteeism, and confidence to manage menstruation).

RESULTS
Participants
A total of 538 menstruating girls were surveyed. The mean age of the sample was 14.49 (SD=1.20).
Self-reported ages were 12-19, with one girl indicating 11 years on the survey but reporting being 12
during eligibility screening. Most of the sample were drawn from Primary Class Level (P)6, 59.29%,
with an additional 18.40% from P5, 16.91% from P7 and 5.39% from P4. Most girls, 72.95%, had
repeated a class level. Ninety-five per cent of the population were Christians with the remaining 5%
Muslim. Of the sample, 83.07% had gone without food, water, medicine or school supplies in the
past year. The mean score for symptoms using DASS-21 items was 12.66 (SD=6.48).
In multi-response option questions capturing all menstrual materials used at home during the last
menstrual period: 58.10% of girls used disposable pads, 32.03% reusable pads, 19.93% cloth, 13.22%
used their underwear alone, 7.64% toilet paper, 7.26% cotton wool and 5.40% used mattress and
other materials. A total of 291 girls (54.49%) washed and reused menstrual materials during their
last period.
A total of 59.14% changed materials three or more times on their heaviest day. Materials were
changed in a bedroom (52.42%), a bathroom (26.39%), latrine (19.89%) or outside (1.30%) when at
home. Most girls, 87.71%, had changed materials away from home at least one day during their last
period.
Item responses
The proportions of responses, and number of missing, for each item in the 54-item pool are
presented in Table 1. Frequencies highlight the menstrual management challenges facing girls. They
also show a lower proportion of girls using the ‘often’ response option. There was a low proportion
of missing data across scale items, varying from 0.00%-4.46%.

Item reduction
We removed items fitting poorly with a parsimonious and theoretically plausible factor structure,
and with the objective of balancing length with coverage. This meant poorly loading items, and some
items that duplicated concepts and had high intercorrelations were removed. Excluded items, with
reasons, are presented in Supplementary Materials 1.
Notably for item reduction, only 27% of girls always felt comfortable to use the same location for
urination during their period as when they were not menstruating, with a lower 23% girls
comfortable at school (items 33 and 37). This casts some doubts regarding responses to the
subsequent items, item 34 and 38, wherein girls reported their worries that others would see their
menstrual blood after urination. It is unclear if this question can apply accurately to those who may
have avoided usual latrines during menstruation. In EFAs we found items 33 and 37, and items 34
and 38 loaded on their own factors. Two-item factors were not considered acceptable for the
measure and all four items were excluded.[32]

Dimensionality
EFA on the first random split-half of the data was undertaken, first for the items applying to all
respondents. This process concluded with a 28-item, four-factor solution explaining 80% of the total
variance. Factorability was confirmed through visual inspection of the polychoric correlation matrix,
and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sampling adequacy of 0.72 for the final 28-item split-half sample.
Thirteen girls were missing more than two items on the final 28 core items that applied to all
respondents. These participants were excluded from subsequent analyses.
A separate EFA was undertaken in the sub-sample of participants who reported they had washed
and reused materials during their last period and answered questions concerning washing and
drying during the last period (n=286). A two-factor solution was retained, with a total of eight items
of the original 12. Factor structure and loadings are presented in Table 2.
EFA was followed by a CFA of the second split-half of the data for the 28 core items, and the entire
subset of those reusing materials for the additional 8 reuse items. The four-factor model was a good
fit for the data (RMSEA=0.028-0.029; CFI=0.961-0.964; TFI=0.957-0.959). In the initial EFA solution
two items (9 and 10) were cross loaded on home and school-related domains. This fit theoretically
with the data since these items did not specify a location. In CFA on the second split-half, these
items loaded more strongly on the school-factor and loaded poorly on the home-factor. These items
were retained under only the ‘transport and school environment needs’ factor. A final CFA on the
full data set supported good model fit for the core 28-items (RMSEA=0.028-0.029; CFI=0.957-0.959;
TFI=0.953-0.955), and the additional reuse items (RMSEA=0.021-0.030; CFI=0.987-0.994; TFI=0.9810.991).
The CFA on the full data set was compared to bi-factor and hierarchical models using structural
equation models (SEM). Neither a bi-factor (RMSEA=0.041; CFI=0.913; TFI=0.906) nor a hierarchical
model (RMSEA=0.051; CFI=0.877; TFI=0.855) were a better fit for the first imputed data set and were
not investigated further.
Model invariance in the full data set was assessed, comparing those exclusively using disposable
sanitary pad (n=191) to others (n=334). A model constraining both thresholds and loadings remained
an acceptable fit (RMSEA=0.029; CFI=0.948; TFI=0.947) supporting the generalisation of latent
constructs (subscales) across these two groups and suggesting that scores can be meaningfully
compared across those using different menstrual materials. Item 6, having enough materials to
change as often as desired, loaded more poorly when groups were separated (estimate=0.36) which
may indicate some variability in this question based on material type.

Scale scores and reliability
Subscale scores and total score were calculated as mean scores where never=0, sometimes=1,
often=2 and always=3 for positively coded items, and the reverse for negatively coded items. All
subscales have ranges from 0 to 3, and higher scores represent more positive experiences. Subscales
specific to those reusing materials were only calculated for this population. Total score included
reuse items for those to whom these were applicable. Plots showing relationships between the core
four factors, and the total score are displayed in Supplementary Materials 2.
Cronbach’s α, and ordinal α are presented in Table 3. Acceptable reliability was achieved for most
subscales. The two three-item subscales, material concerns and reuse insecurity, had poorer internal
consistency.
Fifty-six girls completed the re-test survey. Of those, three were missing scores on MPNS items at
original survey, and one had more than two missing items on the retest. Test-retest reliability for the
52 participants with repeat data using single-measure ICC are displayed in Table 3. Reliability varied
meaningfully between girls we estimated to be reporting on the same menstrual period as the
original survey, compared to those who reported having a new period. We took the reliability among
the subsample of girls reporting on the same menstrual period (n=20) as indicative of scale reliability
as questions specifically ask about the last period.

Validity
Content validity of the scale was assessed through comparison with findings from qualitative
research, FGDs with enumerators undertaking surveys of menstrual hygiene, and survey of experts.
For construct validity, we tested predictive relationships between scale scores and confidence to
manage menstruation, school absenteeism, and mental health symptoms. Bivariate associations are
presented in Table 4. Fewer worries about material reliability and changing were associated with
fewer depression and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, positive perceptions of material, home and
school environment needs were weakly associated with mental health.
More positive perceptions of materials, home and school environments predicted significantly
higher odds of feeling confident to manage menstruation at home or school. Supporting item
validity, positive school assessment was not associated with confidence at home. Material and home
environments did show a weaker, but positive relationship with school management confidence,
however this subscale includes items regarding menstrual materials and disposal which are likely to
cross settings. Fewer concerns about material reliability, insecurity in changing and disposal access
across contexts, and more positive perceptions of materials and home environments were
associated with higher odds of attending school during menstruation. A higher MPNS total score,
which captures girls’ perceptions across all practices and environments, predicted much higher odds
of confidence to manage menstruation and attending school during menses.

DISCUSSION
The Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36) is a self-report measure to evaluate the extent to
which an individuals’ menstrual management practices and environments are perceived to meet
their needs. Development was informed by past research, including review of qualitative and
quantitative studies, and expert input.[3,16,17,33] The final tool reflects experiences across a range
of practices. Emergent factors were theoretically plausible and translated into interpretable
subscales. The MPNS demonstrated good internal consistency, and acceptable test-retest reliability.
Associations with hypothesised correlates supported the validity of the measure and its use in future
research.
We hypothesised a-priori that emergent factors would reflect groups of practices, and that
appraisals of environments would load on separate factors. Hypotheses were partially supported.
The final four-and two-factor structure separated girls’ appraisals of the reliability of their menstrual
materials, home, and school environments. However, items capturing worries and concerns about
changing environments, disposal and materials, loaded separately from ratings of comfort,
satisfaction and adequacy of practices. These factors were not strongly correlated, or in the case of
‘transport and school environment needs’ and ‘change and disposal insecurity’, showed a small to
modest negative correlation. Taken together, relationships suggest that greater satisfaction and
comfort with menstrual practices does not translate into fewer worries about their reliability or risks
to privacy or safety. Appraisals of privacy needs may be more strongly dictated to by internalised
menstrual stigma, social relationships and norms, independent of the acceptability and comfort of
other practices. Inspection of bivariate correlations suggested that trade-offs may be made between
the favourability of the location to change menstrual materials and the accessibility of disposal
options, contributing to negative subscale correlations. The use of ‘worries’ terminology in scale
items was selected to best align with past qualitative reports and to prevent confusion which may
arise in positively and negatively worded items using the same response options.[3,34] However, we
acknowledge this may have been more likely to evoke anxieties than items asking about ‘comfort’ or
having ‘enough’ of various resources. Feedback from enumerators suggested that girls in this study
did not struggle with the nature of these items as the response options were in the affirmative
direction for all questions. Enumerators did report that a measure included for validation, the
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale,[35] which included positively and negatively worded items through
use of alternate wording like “I do” versus “I do not” with the same response options caused
difficulties for respondents. There was no such evidence of difficulties with reverse coded items in
the MPNS-36 in enumerator feedback, frequencies, or visual inspection of surveys. Future research
is needed to further investigate the interrelationships between menstrual needs, insecurities, and
how females make menstrual practice decisions.
Measuring women’s and girls’ menstrual practice needs involves gaining an understanding of the
acceptability, comfort, reliability of practices and insecurities around privacy, safety and exposure of
menstrual status. Drawing on this theoretical underpinning, and the relatively acceptable
performance of bi-factor and hierarchical models including a total score, we would argue that a total
score capturing perceptions across the range of practice and environmental needs is appropriate.
This score is likely to be of use to researchers and practitioners, summarising experience across the
breadth of behaviours. Subscale and total scores were calculated using mean scores rather than
factor scores. Mean scores allow for correction of single missing data points, by averaging across
other items, and are accessible for practitioners who may not have access to the statistical packages
needed to calculate factor scores. Since much of the data on menstrual experiences is collected as

18

part of NGO monitoring and evaluation, comparability across these data and that in research studies
is valuable so we suggest researchers use mean scores.
Insecurities about the privacy and safety of the locations used to change menstrual materials loaded
on the same factor for questions concerning home and school environments. It is important to note
that this indicates that these ratings co-varied, not that change locations in these settings were given
the same ratings. School environments received much more negative appraisals, captured through
frequencies and means. For research or practice evaluation that focuses on either home or school
environments, the separate appraisal of location-specific subscales may need to be validated.
However, further investigation is needed as covariation of home and school privacy ratings could
suggest interdependencies between the two. It is plausible that experiences and learned
expectations from home environments influence perceptions of school environments. Changes to
individuals’ expectations for their menstrual experience in response to interventions was an
overarching theme of a recent meta-synthesis of qualitative studies of menstrual health
interventions and would fit with this interpretation of our findings.[36] Alternatively, a joint
predictor, such as internalised stigma, may contribute to both appraisals. This should be explored in
future research and may indicate the need to assess both location responses even if interventions
only focus on school infrastructure.
Strengths and limitations
Development of items drawing on the experiences of women and girls across low- and middleincome countries through systematic review indicates the potential for the MPNS-36 to be relevant
across contexts. This approach was undertaken at the cost of specificity for the pilot population. A
measure developed through qualitative study of the Soroti schoolgirl population may have yielded a
different prioritisation of items. However, we were mindful of the ongoing measurement needs
across contexts and calls for improved comparability, particularly across trial studies.[5,8] At the
same time, piloting and validation was undertaken in a single context and the measure should be
evaluated in other languages and settings. Feedback from FGDs with enumerators in Niger, and
online survey of experts suggest some languages or contexts may favour a 3-point response scale.
Adapted response options as “less than half the time” and “more than half the time” may be more
specific replacements for “sometimes” and “often” depending on the language of the scale. Our
validation was limited by the lack of past quantitative research on predictive relationships between
menstrual experience and outcomes, and the absence of other measures against which to assess
convergent or divergent validity.
Some items asked of all respondents may not be applicable. For example, those who avoid school
during menstruation were still asked about cleanliness, privacy and safety concerns and may report
fewer worries as they manage their needs by avoiding changing materials at school. For simplicity,
we recommend not using additional filters to questions, however response patterns should be
explored in future studies and through cognitive interviewing, particularly where the measure is
used in intervention studies.
As noted in methods, item reduction drew on factor analysis, but also considered the need for
content validity through the coverage of different menstrual practices. We also prioritised brevity.
Decisions to remove some items, such as those that were felt to duplicate practices may have
reduced the internal consistency metrics of the scale but ensured items represented the breadth of
practice experiences. Two subscales of three items each, ‘material reliability concerns’ and ‘reuse
insecurity’ did not achieve acceptable internal consistency or test-retest reliability. This is likely due
to the small number of items and variability within the short set. We retained these as separate

19

subscales as we recognise concerns about the performance of menstrual materials and worries
about exposure during washing and drying are salient parts of menstrual experiences.[3,12]
Additional or refined items tested in future studies may improve the reliability of these subscales.
Test-retest reliability was assessed in a small sub-sample of participants. This sample size was
reduced further due to the differential reliability between those reporting on the same menstrual
period as their original survey. These data raise questions regarding the variability of menstrual
experiences. Findings could also suggest that participating in the survey made girls more attentive to
their needs during subsequent periods, leading to a change in their appraisals, a possibility that
should be explored in subsequent studies and larger samples.
Implications for research and practice
Quantitative study of menstrual experiences has focused on measures of menstrual practices.
Practices warrant investigation, however, increasingly menstrual health programming and policy
have recognised that individuals and communities vary in their preferences and the practices viewed
as preferable or acceptable.[37] The MPNS-36 prioritises participant perceptions of adequacy above
researcher-defined ‘adequate’ menstrual practices. Although the definition of menstrual hygiene has
evolved, the measure also provides an assessment of self-perceived menstrual hygiene status.
To date, research has relied on single practices, typically use of sanitary pads, to test associations
between menstrual health and hypothesised consequences on school absenteeism or wellbeing.
Such analyses fail to incorporate the range of practices needed for menstrual management, and
poorly translate the findings from qualitative research into quantitative research questions. The
MPNS-36 offers a way to test relationships between overarching menstrual practice experience and
education, health, wellbeing and social participation consequences in cross-sectional or longitudinal
studies. The measure could be applied in needs assessments or NGO monitoring and evaluation. The
MPNS-36 could be used in trials of menstrual health interventions to assess how programs change
practice experiences and would likely represent a key mediating assumption between interventions
such as product provision or sanitation improvements, and end line impacts such as school
attendance. Further studies will be needed to test the association between practice needs as
measured through the MPNS-36 and school attendance, triangulating self-report data with more
reliable methods such as school spot-checks.
Although the tested scale specified school as the location for a subset of items, this wording could be
adapted to the workplace, or when ‘away from home’ when applied to adult or out-of-school
samples. These groups require more attention,[3] and investigation of scale performance in these
populations would be of value.
In sum, the menstrual practice needs scale is a self-report measure specifically developed to assess
the extent to which an individuals’ menstrual management practices and environments are
perceived to meet their needs. The final instrument has high face validity, reflecting experiences
across a range of practices and the total and subscale scores could be useful in needs assessment,
monitoring and exploring intervention impact.

Ethical approvals
All girls provided signed assent to participate. Parents were informed about the study through
parent-teacher meetings at each school, teacher contact with parents, and information sheets in
English and Ateso sent home with girls prior to the study. Parents were asked to contact the school
or study staff if they did not consent to daughters’ participation, or express concerns during parentteacher meetings. No parents expressed concerns about the study and no girls declined
participation.
Ethical approval was provided by Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Institutional Review Board
(IRB approval no: 00009073), and the Mildmay Uganda Research Ethics Committee (MUREC)
(approval ref: 0212-2018). The Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST)
approved the study (ref: SS279ES). Feedback on draft measure items by experts through online
survey and focus group discussions of resident enumerators in Niger were exempted from ethical
review by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Institutional Review Board. Participants of these
consultations consented to participate.
