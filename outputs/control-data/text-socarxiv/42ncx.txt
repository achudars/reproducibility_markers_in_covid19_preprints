"7" "INTRODUCTION"
"8" "The World Health Organization has sought to make abortions safe for women around the world [1].  Abortion remains socially controversial in the United States (US) and debates on the philosophical principl e s of the procedures for medical practitioners have existed for many decades  [ 2-5 ] , which emerge as legislative measures attempting to place limits on access and types of abortion [ 6 ] .  There are other important aspects of abortion  prevalence  for public health impact. For example, a recent study found  evidence  that  infant death rates  had  declined most quickly in states  which  legalized abortion in 1970 — especially  for all low-income quintile  infants  [ 7 ] . Thus, it is plausible that  abortion  law s  have the ability to influence   infant mortality  rates  [ 7 ] .   Our investigation is not concerned with the medical ethics of abortion. Instead, we are primarily interested in identifying if abortion prevalence varies  between-women  by observable factors.  Our specific aim was to report prevalence of abortion by first age of sexual intercourse, by race and ethnic groups, and educational attainment. We hope our study contributes to research interested in serving the medical needs of women."
"9" "METHODS"
"10" "Our analysis  used information on  3,262  females (aged  >  21) from the  National Comorbidity Survey Replication   (NCS-R)  study, which was collected between 2001 and 2003 . The data  forms  part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CEPS) initiative—which aims to collect data about health in minority populations within the US  [ 8 ,9 ] . CPES surveys were sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health and data collection was conducted by the Survey Research Center of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. The NCS-R was administered using laptop computer-assisted personal interview methods at study participants’ home s ,  to a sample of non-institutionalized English-speaking adults aged  >  18 resid ing  in the continental US during the survey period.  Study participants were asked:  Have you ever had an abortion ? Participants who responded with a “yes” where coded as having an abortion. We report the abortion prevalence by age at first coitus, race and ethnic group,  age group,  and educational attainment. Age at first coitus was obtained from responses to the  following question:  How old where you the first time you had sexual intercourse ? Responses were coded by age-range groups."
"11" "RESULTS"
"12" "Table 1   shows  abortion prevalence by age at first coitus, race and ethnic group, and educational attainment. Abortions seem most  prevalent  amongst those who report having sex at younger ages. For example,  29% of females  who first ha d  sexual intercourse between ages 13 and 14  report having an abortion ,  while only 6% of those who first had sex at age 21 or above report having an abortion. Between race and ethnic groups, abortion prevalence  seems  lowest amongst Non-Latino-White females. In terms of  age and  educational attainment, abortion prevalence seems slightly higher for  younger females  with some college and beyond than those with a high school degree or lower.  From our non-representative sample of females, we find abortion prevalence is highest amongst females reporting having 1 st  coitus at young ages, females from younger birth-cohorts, and more highly educated females."

"91" "CONCLUSIONS"
"92" "Whereas other reports present data on age and race [ 10 ], our study adds the variables of age at first coitus and education. Our results indicate that p revalence of abortion may vary between  women  as a function of observable factors like age at first sexual intercourse, race and ethnic status, and educational attainment.  Limitations include that self-reporting on abortion is underreported [1 1 ]."
"93" "We hope our study  contributes to the works of other s   [ 12 ,13 ]  interested in understanding the prevalence and trends of abortions in the population.  This information can be used by policy makers in order to target specific populations --  lack of access to abortion can create unsafe abortion practices  [ 6, 14 ],  and  having  sex   ed ucation  in schools  not only delays age at first coitus but also increases contraceptive use  [ 15 ]."
