Abstract

26

A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalanced local sex ratios are correlated with social

27

consequences, including the pattern and timing of union formation, fertility and relationship stability.

28

Scholars have argued that these findings can be understood as a result of imbalances in the bargaining

29

power the respective sex holds in male- or female-skewed regions, but they remain vague on the

30

underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the literature implicitly considers individual partner market

31

experiences to be a function of local sex ratios. However, empirical evidence on the correspondence

32

between subjective partner availability and local sex ratios remains scarce. This study addresses this gap

33

by linking individual-level German longitudinal survey data (pairfam) with local sex ratios from

34

population data for different entities (states, counties, and municipalities). Using multilevel regression

35

models, this paper analyses the correlations between a subjective partner market indicator and a variety

36

of local sex ratio measures. Moreover, an event history analysis explored how either indicator relates

37

transitions into relationships. Results revealed that none of the local sex ratio measures, including those

38

for narrow age ranges and/or lower level administrative entities, significantly predicted whether

39

individuals predominantly met individuals of their own sex. Event history models yielded significant

40

correlations between this subjective partner market indicator and relationship formation for both

41

genders, substantiating the validity of the subjective indicator. For local sex ratios, results revealed an

42

additional association between local sex ratios and female relationship formation when the sex ratios

43

were adjusted for age hypergamy. Male relationship formation was uncorrelated with any local sex ratio.

44

Both evolutionary and social scientific reasoning on the consequences of sex ratio imbalances rest on

45

assumptions of subjective partner availability that may not be adequately represented by local sex ratios.

46

Future research should be careful not to equate local sex ratios and conscious partner market

47

experiences.

Introduction

50

Imbalanced proportions of men and women (i.e., sex ratios) have been widely recognized to be a

51

demographic determinant of human behaviour. A growing body of literature has pointed out that

52

imbalanced local sex ratios correlate with social consequences, including investment decisions, the

53

participation of females in the labour force, sexual behaviour and the spread of HIV, as well as the

54

incidence of violence and aggression (Bien et al. 2013; Den Boer & Hudson 2004; Diamond-Smith &

55

Rudolph 2018; Durante et al. 2012; Edlund et al. 2013; Feingold 2011; Griskevicius et al. 2012; Merli

56

& Hertog 2010; Schacht et al. 2014, 2016; Schmitt 2005; Trent & South 1988, 2012; Trent et al. 2015;

57

Filser & Schnettler 2018; Schnettler & Filser 2015). The consequences of scarcities of either sex on

58

family formation have received special attention in the literature. Specifically, there is evidence that

59

local sex ratio biases are associated with the age and proportion of individuals marrying and with

60

reproductive outcomes, as well as union formation and stability (Bauer & Kneip 2013; Filser &

61

Schnettler 2019; Kruger et al. 2010; Lyngstad 2011; McLaughlin et al. 1993; Pollet & Nettle 2008;

62

Schacht & Kramer 2016; Schacht & Smith 2017; South et al. 2001; Trent & South 1989, 2011; Uggla

63

& Mace 2016, 2017).

64

Authors have suggested a variety of theoretical explanations for these findings, yet all

65

approaches share an implicit understanding of the local number of males and females as a mating market,

66

thought to be driven by supply-and-demand dynamics (Fossett & Kiecolt 1991; Guttentag & Secord

67

1983; Schacht et al. 2017; Schacht & Kramer 2016). Specifically, scholars have argued that when either

68

sex outnumbers the other, the rarer sex holds more bargaining power and thus can leverage its scarcity

69

both on the partner market and within relationships (Guttentag & Secord 1983; Schacht & Kramer 2016;

70

Uggla & Mace 2017). Consequently, local sex ratios have been predicted to shift sex-specific incentives

71

to pursue different partner market strategies, which elicit responses in individual mating behaviour

72

(Schacht et al. 2017; Guttentag & Secord 1983; Fossett & Kiecolt 1991; Stone 2015; Pedersen 1991;

73

Kokko & Jennions 2008). The common theme of all approaches has been the perspective that local sex

74

ratios approximate an individual’s partner market. Therefore, imbalances in the local sex ratio have been

75

understood to translate into over- or undersupplies of potential partners, which in turn prompts

3

76

individuals to adjust their behaviour (Eckhard & Stauder 2018; Guttentag & Secord 1983; Schacht et al.

77

2017).

78

Yet despite the growing literature, the understanding of the nexus between population-level sex

79

ratio biases and individual behaviour remains limited. Analytically, the literature postulates a contextual

80

hypothesis linking contextual-level sex ratios and individual mating behaviour on the micro level

81

(Coleman 1986; Pollet et al. 2017). When studying contextual hypotheses suggesting behavioural

82

adaptions to the social environment, a crucial question is how closely the contextual data reflects

83

individual experiences (Gilbert et al. 2016; Iversen 1991; Nettle et al. 2012). However, the sex ratio

84

literature so far has been inexplicit on the relation of subjective partner market experiences and local

85

sex ratios. In the sociological partner market literature, scholars have emphasized that the social life in

86

modern societies is structured into “social foci” such as workplaces, voluntary organizations, or

87

hangouts (Feld 1981; Rapp et al. 2015). This insight is not necessarily at odds with the purported effect

88

of local sex ratios, because what matters is that the local proportion of men and women influences a

89

person’s probability of meeting a partner in everyday life (Guttentag & Secord 1983; Obersneider et al.

90

2018; South et al. 2001). The sex ratios in social foci may still be male- or female-biased, depending on

91

the local distribution of men and women. However, because bargaining dynamics are crucial to all

92

theoretical approaches in the sex ratio literature, cognizant decisions and subjective assessments might

93

mediate the purported relationship (Pollet et al. 2017). Unconscious, hormonal variation has been cited

94

as an alternative link between sex ratios and behaviour in the literature (Barber 2009; Maner & McNulty

95

2013; Schacht & Kramer 2016). Yet, both evolutionarily informed approaches such as the Beliefs,

96

Preferences, and Constraints (BPC) model (Gintis 2006) as well as sociological models of decision

97

making (Kroneberg & Kalter 2012) demonstrated that subjective experience provides crucial guidelines

98

for individual decision-making and behaviour. Consequently, for individuals to make decisions

99

contingent on local sex ratios, the latter should correspond to the subjective experience of partner

100

availability.

101

The literature has built on the implicit assumption that micro level subjective partner market

102

experiences are, at least on average, a reflection of the contextual local sex ratios. However, there has

103

been little empirical evidence to support the assumption that subjective partner markets correspond to

4

104

local sex ratio imbalances. To the contrary, one recent study reported that actual neighbourhood sex

105

ratios in Belfast are uncorrelated with perceptions of respondents in a street survey (Gilbert et al. 2016).

106

Nonetheless, although individuals may be unable to evaluate the sex ratios of specific neighbourhoods,

107

the subjective experience of partner markets may correlate with regional, county or municipality sex

108

ratios because they approximate partner market boundaries more accurately. Most previous studies have

109

analysed the consequences of sex ratio variation on a larger geographic scale, using data spanning

110

municipalities, counties, regions or even countries. This appears appropriate because studies have

111

consistently shown the regional nature of partner markets, including online dating markets (Bruch &

112

Newman 2019; Haandrikman et al. 2008). Larger regional entities may better approximate the spheres

113

of interaction, and therefore the respective local sex ratios could correspond to micro level individual

114

partner market experiences. However, to our best knowledge, no study exists that explored the

115

correlation between subjective partner market experiences and local sex ratios for populations in such

116

large geographic areas.

117

This study analysed how contextual local sex ratio measures relate to individual experiences of

118

partner market imbalances. Specifically, the analysis focused on the correlation between reported

119

surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals and the local proportions of men and women.

120

Combining survey data with German administrative population data enabled to create a range of local

121

sex ratio measures based on different definitions of relevant age groups and different levels of

122

aggregation (states, counties, and municipalities) to replicate the variation in operationalized sex ratios

123

in the literature. Adjusting for a number of relevant control variables, this study addressed widespread,

124

yet untested, assumptions regarding the correspondence of subjective partner markets and local sex

125

ratios. To substantiate the analysis with regard to partner market-related outcomes, a longitudinal event

126

history analysis demonstrated the predictive validity of the subjective indicator for transitions into

127

relationships. Together with this complementary analysis, this study explored the relevancy of

128

subjective partner market experiences and local sex ratio measures for union formation patterns.

5

129

Measuring the Sex Ratio

130

A key assumption in the literature on sex ratios is that individuals modify their behaviour in response to

131

imbalanced sex ratios. Therefore, any sex ratio measure should approximate the subjective partner

132

market experience to be a meaningful representation of individual mating behaviour constraints.

133

However, the literature has been inconsistent with regard to which population subgroups should be

134

considered for calculating local sex ratios.

135

In particular, the age limits used to calculate sex ratios has differed between studies. Adult sex

136

ratios (ASR) for the 16 to 40-, 45-, or 50-year-old population have been common in the literature

137

(Schacht et al. 2016; Schacht & Kramer 2016; Schacht & Smith 2017; Uggla & Mace 2017). In some

138

studies, the range has been extended to include adults up to 64 years old (Barber 2000; Kruger et al.

139

2010; Lippa 2009). A variant of ASRs are operational sex ratios (OSRs), which only include unmarried

140

or single adults (Kruger et al. 2010; Kruger & Schlemmer 2009a, 2009b). However, scholars have

141

reported that in monogamous societies, ASRs and OSRs are highly correlated (Fossett & Kiecolt 1991;

142

Pollet & Nettle 2008). Moreover, excluding partnered individuals from sex ratios to capture partner

143

markets overlooks the fact that especially in Western societies, divorces are common and infidelity

144

remains among the leading causes for divorce (Amato & Previti 2003; Rapp et al. 2015; Scott et al.

145

2013; South & Lloyd 1995). Therefore, married and partnered individuals are not permanently removed

146

from the partner market, as OSRs would imply. Accordingly, OSRs appear theoretically inferior to

147

ASRs when approximating subjective partner markets, especially given that in monogamous societies,

148

differences between OSRs and ASRs are only due to long-distance relationships and marriages any way.

149

The majority of sex ratio studies based their analyses on only a single ASR measure (see Schacht

150

et al. 2014 p. 218; Pollet et al. 2017 p. 2 for overviews). Consequently, studies commonly have assigned

151

the same ASR to all individuals within the same regional entity. Scholars explain their choice of relevant

152

age ranges by referring to (early) adulthood as the prime life stage for mate choice and reproduction

153

(Kruger et al. 2010; Pollet & Nettle 2008; Schacht & Kramer 2016; Uggla & Mace 2017). The intention

154

is that ASRs reflect partner market constraints during the life stages of union formation and fertility.

155

However, computing sex ratios for wide age brackets may blur partner market squeezes within certain

156

age cohorts. A potentially skewed sex ratio in one age cohort might be counterbalanced by an opposite
6

157

skew in other cohort(s) that are otherwise only of limited relevance as potential partners. This becomes

158

problematic when using wide age brackets. For instance, 20-year-olds might occasionally enter a

159

relationship with a 30-year-old individual, 50- or 60-year-old partners have been shown to be the

160

exception rather than the rule (Esteve et al. 2009; Feighan 2018; Kolk 2015; Van Poppel et al. 2001).

161

Hence, sex ratios for wide age brackets should only be loose approximations of subjective partner

162

markets since including less relevant age cohorts induces random noise in the measure.

163

Some authors have approached this problem by using narrower age brackets and by

164

incorporating age heterogamy patterns into sex ratio measures by using age shifts between female and

165

male cohorts (Parrado & Zenteno 2002). Age hypergamy, in which men are approximately two years

166

older than their female partners, is a demographic constant in many populations (Esteve et al. 2009;

167

Feighan 2018; Kolk 2015; Van Poppel et al. 2001). Sex ratios using age shifts reflect this age

168

discrepancy by including male age cohorts that are two years older than their female counterparts. A

169

more sophisticated approach that has been proposed in the literature is to weigh sex ratios based on the

170

existing age and educational homogamy patterns to obtain so-called “availability ratios” (Eckhard &

171

Stauder 2017; Fossett & Kiecolt 1991; Goldman et al. 1984). However, availability ratios have been

172

criticized for endogeneity problems as hyper- or hypogamy may themselves be responses to unbalanced

173

partner pools (De Hauw et al. 2014).

174

The current study analysed the correlation between multiple operationalisations of local sex

175

ratios and subjective surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals from a nation-wide survey. To

176

replicate the variety of operationalisations of local sex ratios in the literature, a range of local sex ratio

177

measures were calculated from German administrative population data. These measure reflected

178

different definitions of relevant age groups and for different levels of aggregation (states, counties, and

179

municipalities). Past studies have shown that future partners tend to live in proximity to one another, as

180

85% of couples in Germany live within 20 km of one another before forming a relationship (Lengerer

181

2001 p. 142). The recent rise of internet dating might obliterate regional boundaries of partner markets.

182

However, recent studies have shown that online dating markets and social networks exhibit a

183

considerable degree of regional clustering (Bailey et al. 2018; Bruch & Newman 2019). Consequently,

184

the regional nature of partner markets should still have been meaningful during the study period (2008-

7

185

2015). In Germany, counties are responsible for organizing public transport and schools, which results

186

in a noticeable clustering of social life into these entities. This leads to the general expectation that

187

counties should approximate local partner markets better than smaller (municipalities) or larger (states)

188

entities (Eckhard & Stauder 2017; Obersneider et al. 2018). Consequently, county-level sex ratios

189

should exhibit the closest relation with reports of surplus encounters with same-sex individuals,

190

compared to sex ratios for other regional entities. Moreover, age-specific sex ratios should better capture

191

partner market imbalances and therefore correlate more closely with subjective reports of surplus

192

encounters with same-sex individuals than adult sex ratios, since they approximate age bounds of partner

193

pools more adequately.

194

Methods and Data

195

This analysis combined data from two sources: First, individual data on subjective partner market

196

experience and individual-level control variables came from the first seven waves (2008-2015) of the

197

Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) (Brüderl et al. 2016a). Pairfam

198

is an annual panel survey of partnership and family dynamics in three German birth cohorts (1971-73,

199

1981-83, and 1991-93). In total, 12,402 respondents participated in the first wave of the survey. This

200

data was particularly suited for this study given its stratified two-stage sampling procedure (Brüderl et

201

al. 2016b). In the first stage, municipalities of the Federal Republic of Germany were sampled.

202

Subsequently, respondents were randomly selected based on local population registers, resulting in a

203

stratified random sample that matched the hierarchical nature of this analysis (individuals being

204

clustered into regional entities). Secondly, local sex ratios were calculated from official population data

205

for German states (NUTS level 1), counties (NUTS 3) and municipalities (LAU 1) as published by the

206

Federal and Regional Statistical Office (table series 173-43 and 173-44).

207
208

Surplus of encounters with same-sex individuals

209

The focal indicator of this study, the surplus of encounters with same-sex individuals, captures whether

210

respondents think they meet (far) more individuals of their own sex than of the opposite-sex (see Table

211

1 for the exact phrasing). Higher scores were therefore indicative of a higher proportion of interactions
8

212

with same-sex individuals relative to opposite-sex individuals. The indicator question was part of the

213

interview section for respondents who identified as singles in a preceding question. Interviewers

214

prefaced the section with the following phrase: “And now to your chances of meeting a partner. To what

215

extent the following statements apply to your situation?” Consequently, interviewers directed

216

respondents towards reflecting on interactions relevant to their subjective experience of the partner

217

market when answering the indicator question. Table 1 displays the distribution of the subjective

218

indicator and the original wording of the question, revealing that all categories were sufficiently

219

populated.

220

Since the indicator on opposite sex encounters was part of pairfam’s survey module for singles, the

221

analytical sample was restricted to respondents who are not in a relationship at the time of the interview.

222

Furthermore, due to filtering questions, the sample has been also restricted to those singles who do not

223

report that they are uninterested in having a partner. This filtering mechanism may have induced a

224

selectivity bias, as respondents in unfavourable local sex ratio environments might be more likely to

225

have stopped looking for a relationship in view of poor partner market prospects. However, this

226

eventuality has been ruled out, because logistic regressions on being uninterested to find a partner

227

yielded no significant associations with local sex ratios. Moreover, the analytical sample was restricted

228

to heterosexual individuals because the sex ratio literature focuses on heterosexual individuals and

229

homosexual relationships only constitute .3% of couples in Germany (Eckhard & Stauder 2018).

230
231

Local proportions of men

232

Local sex ratios were calculated from official annual population data for German states (Länder),

233

counties (Landkreise and Kreisfreie Städte) and municipalities (Gemeinden) as published by the Federal

234

and Regional Statistical Office (table series 173-43 and 173-44). Individuals from the pairfam survey

235

were linked with local sex ratios based on their municipality of (primary) residence. This created a

236

unique combination of the nationwide variation in local sex ratios with detailed individual-level survey

237

data. Official population data was per December 31st, and the pairfam survey interviews were conducted

238

in the autumn and spring of the respective year to allow a close chronological match of both

239

measurements. Following the recommendations of Ancona et al. (2017), this analysis operationalised
9

240

sex ratios as the proportion of the male population (PM) for the respective age groups and administrative

241

entities.

242

Instead of calculating sex ratios for the single population, the local sex ratio measures included

243

the entire population of the respective entity for three main reasons. Firstly, married and partnered

244

individuals may leave their current partner for a new relationship and therefore are not permanently

245

removed from the partner market. In fact, research has shown that the availability of alternative partners

246

increased the likelihood of union dissolutions and infidelity remains among the leading causes for

247

divorce (Amato & Previti 2003; Rapp et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2013; South & Lloyd 1995). Moreover,

248

authors have pointed out that the correlation between the sex ratio for unmarried individuals and the sex

249

ratio for the entire population of the same age bracket is very high (e.g. Fossett & Kiecolt 1991). This

250

also makes sense from a theoretical point of view: sex ratios can only differ when married individuals

251

are not living in the same regional entity as their spouses, a relationship constellation that is rare in

252

Germany (Dorbritz & Naderi 2013). Lastly and most importantly, the subjective indicator question did

253

not differentiate between encounters with married and single individuals. Consequently, including all

254

persons when calculating the local sex ratios appeared appropriate to ensure an optimal match of the

255

subjective indicator on surplus interactions with same-sex individuals and the local sex ratio measures

256

for the analysis.

257

This study used two types of local sex ratio measures: first, the proportion of men in the adult

258

population aged 16 to 39, 16 to 49 and 16 to 64 for the respective geographies replicated adult sex ratios

259

as commonly used in previous research (henceforth referred to as PMA). A second variant were age-

260

specific proportion of men in the population (ASPM) that reflected the proportion of men in a certain

261

age group, including those that are one, two, three, four or five years younger or older than the individual.

262

ASPM can be understood as an adaption of availability ratios, but they avoid endogeneity problems due

263

to the weighting of sex ratios based on existing heterogamy patterns (De Hauw et al. 2014 p. 11). For

264

example, for a person aged 30, an ASPM with a 4-year age-width reflects the sex ratio of the 26- to 34-

265

year-old population. Moreover, the analysis also tested ASPMs with age shifts that reflect men who are

266

one and two years older than their female counterpart groups to incorporate the typical age hypergamy

267

in Germany (Klein 1996). Here, an ASPM with a 4-year age-width and a two-year age shift would have

10

268

resulted in a 30-year-old man being assigned the sex ratio of 26- to 34-year-old men paired with 24- to

269

32-year-old women. The 4-year wide ASPM for women aged 30 incorporated 28- to 36-year-old men

270

and 26- to 34-year-old women. Due to data limitations, ASPMs were only obtainable for counties and

271

states. Overall, the variance of sex ratios is smaller when the geographical units are larger and when

272

more age cohorts are included in the sex ratio measures (Tables 2 & 3). The PMAs vary less than the

273

ASPMs, and sex ratios for states vary less than those for counties, which in turn exhibit less variation

274

than municipality-level sex ratios (Tables 2 & 3).

275

Statistical approach

276

The analytical approach consisted of two parts: First, the data for all seven waves was pooled to analyse

277

the association between the perceived surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals and PMAs or

278

ASPMs. To incorporate the nested data structure, three-level multilevel regression models were fitted.

279

The dependent variable on level one was the reported surplus of encounters with same-sex individuals.

280

To adjust for unmeasured variation between individuals on level two and administrative units (i.e.,

281

states, counties, and municipalities) on level three, two random intercepts were included. Separate

282

models for each measure of the local proportion of men were fitted.

283

Second, the analysis explored how both local sex ratios, operationalised as PMA and ASPM,

284

and the surplus of encounters with same-sex individuals predict union formation using longitudinal

285

multilevel discrete-time event history models. The occurrence of union formation is time-lagged to

286

avoid reverse causality. Consequently, logistic regression models including random intercepts for the

287

administrative units were fitted to predict the probability of finding a partner in the subsequent panel

288

wave. Again, separate models for each of the local PMA and ASPM measures were calculated.

289

Table 4 shows that the final samples include 3,341 men and 2,686 women for the regression

290

models at the state level. Due to missing population data resulting from administrative restructuring

291

during the observation period, the samples for counties and municipalities were slightly smaller than for

292

states. The longitudinal sample comprised 2,573 men and 2,041 women with 4,532 years at risk for

293

women and 6,655 years at risk for men. During the observation period, 1,249 women and 1,274 men

294

had formed a new union. All models adjusted for a set of individual and contextual control variables.

295

On the individual level, these were age and age squared, (being on track for) higher secondary education
11

296

(i.e., Abitur), labour force status and children. Beyond the respective measure for the proportion of men,

297

contextual control variables included residence (i.e., in East or West Germany) and the population size

298

of the residential municipality. Models were fitted separately for men and women.

299

Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for each level of measurement to

300

reveal the potential clustering of individuals in the dataset across states, counties, and municipalities.

301

The ICC describes how strongly those within a group resemble one another based on the proportion of

302

the variance accounted for by the group level (Snijders & Bosker 2012 p. 17). Due to the large number

303

of separate models, results are presented as combined coefficient plots that only contain coefficients for

304

the focal independent variablesn from each model.

305

306

Results

307

Surplus of same-sex encounters and local male population shares

308

The results from a series of regression models predicting the surplus of encounters with same-sex

309

individuals revealed that surpluses same-sex encounters (SESSI) as reported of female respondents were

310

not associated with state-level male population shares. This finding was consistent for all age-specific

311

proportions of men (ASPMs) representing populations that are one, two, three, four or five years younger

312

and older than the individual (upper right panel of Figure 1). Similarly, but one indicator for proportions

313

of men in the adult population (PMA) did not yield significant associations with SESSIs. The state-level

314

PMA for the 16- to 49-year-old population proved to be a significant predictor of SESSI reports by

315

female respondents, although the sign of the association was counterintuitive: the higher the proportion

316

of men, the more often women reported meeting more women than men. Additionally, Figure 1 shows

317

the ASPMs for male and female age cohorts that are age-shifted. Age-shifted ASPMs were

318

operationalised so that female age cohorts were one or two years younger than their male counterparts

319

to approximate common age hypergamy patterns. Yet , neither the ASPMs shifted by one year (centre

320

right panel of Figure 1) nor the ASPMs shifted by two years (lower right panel of Figure 1) yielded

321

significant coefficients when predicting the women’s reports of surplus own-sex contacts.

12

322

For men, two age-symmetrical ASPMs, but none of the PMAs, were associated with men’s

323

reports of surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals (upper left panel of Figure 1). All

324

significant coefficients were positive in sign, matching intuitive expectations: men reported meeting

325

more men when the state’s respective population aged three and four years older and younger was more

326

male-biased. Furthermore, models yielded similar associations when incorporating a one-year age shift

327

in the state-level ASPMs, such that female age cohorts were one year younger than the male cohorts

328

included in the ASPM measure. The ASPMs based on individuals three, four, and five years older and

329

younger were significantly correlated with the men’s SESSI (centre left panel of Figure 1). However,

330

none of the corresponding ASPMs with a two-year age shift predicted men’s SESSI in a statistically

331

significant way (lower left panel of Figure 1). Notably, the ICCs suggested that reports of surplus

332

encounters with same-sex individuals did not correlate within states for either women or men.

333

However, the models using PM indicators for smaller entities supported neither of these

334

significant associations with state-level proportions of men. For both men and women, county-level

335

PMAs and ASPMs failed to predict significantly surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals

336

(Figure 2). The ICCs suggested that the correspondence of subjective sex ratios within the same county

337

was slightly higher than within states, but again was negligible. Similarly, none of the municipality-

338

level PMAs were associated with SESSI (Figure 3). Again, the low intra-class correlations supported

339

this notion. In sum, local sex ratios failed to predict surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals

340

with the notable exception of selected state-level sex ratio indicators.

341

Table 5 shows the coefficients of the control variables, which remained essentially the same

342

across all models. Similarly, analysing the data for each wave separately yielded essentially the same

343

results as those presented here.

344

345

Union formation

346

Figure 4 shows the average marginal effects of the indicator on surplus of encounters with same-sex

347

individuals (SESSI) as well as the state-level proportions of men among adults (PMA) and age-specific

348

male population shares (ASPM). For both men and women, coefficients for SESSI were significantly

349

and negatively associated with union formation. In other words, the probability of finding a partner in

350

the subsequent panel wave was lower if the respondents reported a higher surplus of interactions with

351

individuals of their own than the opposite sex. The effect for women was twice as large as the effect for

352

men, suggesting a greater relevancy of surpluses of same-sex interactions for women than for men.

353

With regard to the local sex ratio indicators, male chances to find a partner were significantly associated

354

with state-level ASPMs based on a one-year age width and a one-year age shift. Here, the probability of

355

males forming a union was positively associated with a local oversupply of men. However, none of the

356

age-symmetric nor any other ASPMs proved to be significant predictors of male relationship formation.

357

Moreover, neither of the state-level PMAs were associated with men’s probability to enter a relationship.

358

For women, the state-level ASPMs were positively correlated with union formation only when age

359

hypergamy was incorporated. The probability of females finding a partner was higher when there was a

360

higher proportion of men within a state. Similarly to men, state-level PMAs were uncorrelated with

361

female relationship formation. Overall, the ICC values were low, suggesting no correlation of the

362

probability to form a union within states.

363

Models using county-level sex ratio measures yielded replicated the insignificant results for age-

364

symmetric proportions of men (Figure 5): neither the PMAs nor age-symmetric ASPMs yielded

365

significant coefficients. Male union formation was consistently uncorrelated with any of the county-

366

level sex ratio measures, including those age-specific indicators incorporating an age-shift. Similarly,

367

female relationship formation was associated with neither the PMAs nor the age-symmetric ASPMs.

368

However, all of the ASPMs with a two-year age shift, that is female age cohorts two years younger than

369

the correspondings male age cohorts, turned out to be a significant predictor of females transitioning

370

into a relationship. Coefficient estimates suggest that a higher age-specific and two-year age shifted

371

male population share within a county is associated with a higher probability for women to enter a

372

relationship.
14

373

Surpluses of encounters with same-sex individuals were consistently negatively associated with union

374

formation, and the size of the estimates does not differ between the models (see Table 6 for coefficients

375

of control variables). This underscores the independence of the subjective SESSI indicator and local sex

376

ratios as presented in the section above.

377

Similarly, Figure 6 shows that the coefficients for surpluses of same-sex interactions remain the

378

same in the models that include municipality-level proportions of men among adults (PMA). As in the

379

models for state- and county-level sex ratios, the municipality-level PMAs did not correlate significantly

380

with the probability of female or male union formation. Hence, PMAs were not a significant predictor

381

of union formation at any level of aggregation. Furthermore, the ICC values revealed that the correlation

382

of transitions into relationships were actually higher when clustered by counties than by municipality.

383

However, these differences should be treated with caution given that overall, the ICCs were very low

384

for any configuration.

385

Discussion

386

Imbalanced sex ratios have been linked to consequences for family formation, economic decision-

387

making, gender roles, partnership formation, fertility, personality, and sexuality (Bauer & Kneip 2013;

388

Feingold 2011; Griskevicius et al. 2012; Harknett 2008; Merli & Hertog 2010; Pollet & Nettle 2008;

389

Schacht & Smith 2017; Trent & South 2012; Uggla & Mace 2017). Crucial to all sociodemographic and

390

evolutionary mating market approaches seeking to explain these associations are shifts in bargaining

391

power based on differential mating opportunities in an imbalanced sex ratio environment. Implicitly,

392

such reasoning presupposes that local sex ratios correspond to subjective partner market experiences.

393

Given that

394

Kroneberg & Kalter 2012), local sex ratios should, at least on average, reflect individual partner market

395

perceptions to affect individual partner market and within relationship behaviour. However, this

396

assumption has so far gone untested and this paper was the first to test this assumption. Specifically, this

397

study analysed associations between a variety of local sex ratio measures and individual singles’ reports

398

of whether their partner market relevant interactions were predominantly with individuals of their own

these subjective experiences provide crucial guidelines for behaviour (Gintis 2006;

15

399

sex. In addition, this paper presented an event history analysis to assess how both these subjective partner

400

market experiences and local sex ratios relate to relationship formation.

401

The results of this study support two conclusions. First, subjective surpluses of encounters with

402

same-sex individuals were not predicted by local sex ratios. Across a large variety of age

403

operationalisations, neither of the local sex ratio measures turned out to be a significant predictor for the

404

subjective indicator of surplus same-sex contacts. In particular, the subjective indicator was not

405

associated with any of the variants of adult sex ratios on either county or state level. This finding is

406

particularly relevant given the widespread use of adult sex ratios in the sex ratio literature (Pollet et al.

407

2017). Future research should take into account that adult sex ratios are unlikely to correspond closely

408

to subjective, cognisant partner market experiences. However, while the surpluses of encounters with

409

same-sex individuals were not associated with county- and municipality-level sex ratios, the analysis

410

yielded significant associations between the subjective indicator and age-shifted sex ratios on the state

411

level. However, some reservations regarding the state-level findings seem warranted, because the

412

German states might be too large in geographic terms (with all but three being larger than 2,500 km²) to

413

be considered a single partner market. For example, Lengerer (2001 p. 142) reports that 85% of future

414

partners in Germany live within a 20 km radius of each other, and only 2-5% of all relationships are

415

formed between individuals living over 100 km apart. The rise of social media and online dating

416

platforms might blur regional structures of partner markets. However, recent publications suggest that

417

online partner markets exhibit a marked regional gradient, because people are mainly looking for a

418

partner from nearby (Bailey et al. 2018; Bruch & Newman 2019). Consequently, past recommendations

419

to rely on smaller entities when operationalising local partner markets continue to apply (Fossett &

420

Kiecolt 1991). Since the models using age-shifted sex ratios for the county level did not replicate the

421

state-level findings, scepticism of the substantiality of state-level associations seems appropriate. For

422

similar reasons, the significant results for state-level sex ratios and relationship formation should be

423

treated with caution and can only serve as a reference point.

424

The second main finding of this paper is that subjective surpluses of same-sex encounters

425

significantly predicted relationship formation. For both sexes, a higher proportion of interactions with

426

individuals of one’s own sex was associated with a lower probability of entering a relationship in the

16

427

subsequent period. The authors are aware that survey questions on subjective partner market experiences

428

may represent an excessive demand for respondents. However, the fact that the subjective indicator

429

correlates with this specific partner market outcome supports the idea that the analysed reports of surplus

430

interactions with same-sex individuals constituted a valid approximation of individual partner market

431

experiences. The fact that the subjective indicator had predictive validity for partner market outcomes

432

substantiates the interpretation of main results as presented above: the non-correspondence between

433

local sex ratio and the subjective partner market experiences is due to an actual disconnect rather than a

434

misreporting or non-validity of the subjective indicator.

435

Concerning the local sex ratio measures, age-specific and age-shifted operationalisations proved

436

to be advantageous over adult sex ratios when predicting union formation. Both the state- and county-

437

level sex ratios significantly predicted female relationship formation. None of the measures of adult sex

438

ratios significantly predicted entering a relationship. Most notably, age-symmetric measures, i.e., sex

439

ratios that reflected men and women of the same age cohorts, also did not yield significant correlations,

440

even if the sex ratios were limited to narrow age ranges. In fact, it was the integration of age hypergamy

441

into the sex ratio measures that yielded significant results for the effect of local sex ratio on female

442

relationship formation. However, this association was only significant when sex ratios were age-specific

443

and age-shifted. Moreover, age-specific sex ratios did not significantly predict the probability of males

444

finding a partner, replicating similar asymmetric findings by Uggla and Mace (2017). With regard to the

445

link to subjective partner market experiences, age-specific sex ratios that approximate age-hypergamy

446

patterns were not associated with the subjective partner market indicator for either sex, as was seen for

447

age-symmetric age-specific and adult sex ratio measures. This suggests that subjective partner market

448

experiences and local sex ratios should be considered as distinct context variables instead of equivalent

449

indicators and that this is even true for detailed measures of local sex ratios.

450

In sum, the results of this study suggest that local numbers of men and women may not affect

451

individual impressions of partner markets or at least the conscious individual experience of partner

452

markets. Therefore, conscious adjustments in mating behaviour in reaction to partner over- or

453

undersupplies appear unlikely. Although age-specific county-level sex ratios with a two-year age shift

454

were a significant predictor of female relationship formation, they were not correlated with subjective

17

455

reports of opposite-sex contacts. Consequently, these findings suggest that subjective and local sex ratios

456

are not interchangeable operationalisations, but rather are two separate dimensions of partner market

457

circumstances. Researchers should be aware of this distinction when offering theoretical interpretations

458

of results based on local sex ratios.

459

The subjective partner market indicator used in this study is not equivalent to the situational

460

perception of the sex proportions in a group. Instead, it approximated the everyday interactions of

461

individuals and therefore should not be interpreted as indicative of an inability to perceive sex ratios in

462

set groups. Both Alt et al. (2017) and Neuhoff (2017) demonstrated that participants are able to give

463

accurate sex ratio estimations based on short term exposure to visual and auditory cues. Against the

464

background of these findings, one potential explanation for findings of this study could be that individual

465

partner market experiences are not a direct representation of macrostructural conditions, i.e., local sex

466

ratios (Blau 1977; Filser & Schnettler 2018; Rapp et al. 2015; Schwartz 1990). Instead, individual

467

partner markets may be structured in different “foci of activity” such workplaces, voluntary associations,

468

or hangouts (Feld 1981; Rapp et al. 2015). With this in mind, studying the consequences of sex ratios

469

in interactive spheres such as workplaces (Åberg 2009; Barclay 2013; Svarer 2007), industries (Uggla

470

& Andersson 2018), bars (Lycett & Dunbar 2000), or colleges (Harknett & Cranney 2017) would have

471

the advantage of assuming that individuals are actually interacting with one another is much more

472

plausible than the same contention would be for local sex ratios. Consequently, individuals’ foci-specific

473

sex ratios might have a more accurate impression of partner supply and demand within the respective

474

foci rather than sex ratios of the local population, even for their specific age cohort.

475

This paper utilized a combination of administrative population information and survey data,

476

which is crucial to this analysis. Studies relying on such data face a trade-off between the scope of the

477

data and the ability to link survey data with survey-based partner market measures. The pairfam survey

478

data constitute a unique combination of both ends of the data spectrum. However, German county-level

479

adult sex ratios may not have sufficient variation to allow for identifying a clear effect. Local adult sex

480

ratios may vary more dramatically in selected regions, most notably in the male-skewed populations of

481

China and India (Guilmoto 2012). Nevertheless, the county-level variation in the adult sex ratios in the

482

analysed data was consistent with that of recent studies from other western countries (eg. Schacht &

18

483

Kramer 2016), and the ranges of age-specific sex ratios exceed the ranges of PMAs. A further limitation

484

is that the findings are contingent on the validity of the subjective partner market measure. Whereas

485

Rapp et al. (2015) used a detailed survey to approximate the subjective partner markets based on foci-

486

specific sex ratios, the current analysis was limited to one global subjective indicator. A closer

487

approximation of subjective partner market experiences based on a detailed inquiry of partner markets

488

in different foci would be desirable. This could reveal whether partner markets in specific foci actually

489

correspond to local sex ratios, whereas partner markets in other foci do not. In particular, detailed

490

information on job location could be of particular relevance, as 60% of German employees cross

491

municipality borders when commuting (Pütz 2017). Consequently, adding sex ratios based on the place

492

of work could yield a higher correspondence to subjective partner markets.

493

Regardless, future research on the consequences of local sex ratios should be cautious regarding

494

the assumption that individuals are aware of partner shortages or oversupplies on a local level.

495

Subjective, cognisant partner market experiences do not appear to be a direct function of local numbers

496

of men and women, and future research should consider this when interpreting findings based on local

497

sex ratios.

Results for multilevel linear regression models for the dependent variable surplus of encounter with same-sex individuals. Models include individual-level variables and ASR, income and education
as fixed effects and the respective entity as a random effect. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) describes how strongly those within a group resemble one another (0: not at all, 1: identical).
The terms σ² and τ² represent the variance between administrative and ids entities, respectively. The coefficients for individual-level control variables are virtually unchanged across models using
different sex ratio specifications.

Results for multilevel linear logistic regression models for the dependent variable transition into relationships. Coefficients are reported as logits. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) describes
how strongly those within a group resemble one another (0: not at all, 1: identical). The term σ² represents the variance between the respective administrative entities. The coefficients for individuallevel control variables are virtually unchanged across models using different sex ratio specifications.
