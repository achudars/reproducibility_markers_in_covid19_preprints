Entrepreneurial Orientation for Sustainable Competitive Advantage and Risk
Management: Evidence from Government-Linked Companies in Malaysia
Abstract
This study is an attempt to assess the status of the current level of entrepreneurial orientation
among the Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. This study collected primary
data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in
Malaysia. The data were collected based on opinions of the seven factors of entrepreneurial
orientation practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using
descriptive statistics. Further, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s alpha
test, the validity of the data was tested by checking the normality test through skewness and
kurtosis, and the consistency of the data was tested using factor analysis. On an average,
70.9% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of entrepreneurial
orientation. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on entrepreneurial orientation
than the state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of entrepreneurial
orientation of GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on recognizing individual risk takers for
their willingness to champion new projects, whether it eventually turns out to be successful or
not, encouraging employees to take calculated risks with new ideas, considering the term
“risk taker” as a positive attribute for people in the organization, and supporting many small
and experimental projects by realizing that some will undoubtedly fail.
Key Words: entrepreneurial orientation, government0linked companies, sustainable

1. Introduction
The resource-based view theory (RBV) focuses on transforming valuable resources of the
organization to assist in achieving its goals (Barney, 1991). RBV states that organizations
that are able to use or fully utilize their resources, such as raw materials, skills, etc., will have
the opportunity to gain competitive advantages over their competitors (Grant, 1991), and
offer sustainable competitive advantage to the organization (Macfarlane, 2014). Competitive
advantage is a situation where the organization is able to create or improve its product and
make it superior to the competitors’ product. Sustainable competitive advantage will help the
organization cope with the changes in the environment and stay successful in the future
(Ketchen & Short, 2014) by achieving long-term competitive advantage, which will be costly
and difficult to imitate by their competitors (Papulova & Papulova, 2006).
Sustainable competitive advantage can bring many advantages, as it is a powerful
source for the organization to achieve superior performance and create value for the
organization (Gupta & Benson, 2011). According to Barney (1991), organizations could
create competitive advantages by obtaining valuable, rare, inimitable resources, and
capabilities. Obtaining such resources will lead to value creation and sustainability in the
organization. Kraaijenbrink & Spender (2011) also state that without value creation, the
organization would have no added value and thus, there would be no reason for the
organization to exist in the market. Value creation can improve the performance of the
organization by maximizing earnings per share, ensure high levels of operational
effectiveness, and remain competitive (Gholami, 2011). This will indirectly help the
organization to implement strategies to improve their efficiency and competitiveness (Porter,
1997).

However, there is no guarantee that all of the resources will lead to competitive
advantage or value creation. This is because, according to Kraaijenbrink and Spender (2011),
people may perceive values differently. What one perceives as valuable may not be the same
for another person. Moreover, due to globalization and the increase in competition, it is hard
for organizations to sustain and cope with the rapid changes in the environment. Therefore,
organizations must be able to offer or create something new in order to differentiate
themselves from their competitors. According to Prieto and Revilla (2006), organizations that
are able to offer something different in the market have the potential to achieve superior
performance and are able to create value for their organization.
Therefore, in order to ensure the sustainability of some government agencies, the
government of Malaysia decided to privatize the companies, which led to the formation of the
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs). GLCs are defined as companies that achieve the
primary commercial objective of the Malaysian government (Khazanah, 2014) and the
Malaysian government has a direct controlling stake in these companies (OECD, 2013). The
controlling stake refers not only to the percentage of their ownership, but also their direct or
indirect influence in the appointment of directors and senior management officers. They also
make major decisions such as contracting awards, strategizing, restructuring, financing, and
acquisition and divestments through Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs). In
other words, GLCs are controlled by the Malaysian government via GLICs, Khazanah,
Ministry of Finance Inc. (MOF), Employees Provident Fund (EPF), and Bank Negara
Malaysia (BNM).1
GLCs cover a wide spectrum of economic activities from infrastructure,
telecommunication, agriculture, to financial services. Thus, GLCs play an important role in
the operation of every commercial concern in Malaysia and contribute significantly towards
improving the quality of life for the public (Abdullah, 2007; Razak, 2012). GLCs are a
corporate entity that may be a private company or a public listed company. However, GLCs
only account for about five percent of the total companies in Bursa Malaysia (formerly
known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange or KLSE), GLCs’ market capitalization amounts to
RM 232 billion, which is more than half of Malaysia’s Gross Domestic Product (Md Zin &
Sulaiman, 2011).
The main objective of an organization is to improve the performance and the business
process of the organization so that they will be as competitive as other companies in the
market (Aivazian, Ge, & Qiu, 2005). According to Phua (2001), the government economic
planners believe that the privatization of public services would bring many advantages to the
country. This is in line with past evidence that agrees privatization could increase the
efficiency of the organization, greater utilization of growth opportunities, reduce the
administrative and financial burdens of the Malaysian government, and increase Bumiputera
participants in the corporate sector (Nambiar, 2009). However, there are issues in which
GLCs are labelled as underperforming, as they deal with dual objectives, which are to make
profits and fulfil social obligations. This has given GLCs an adverse image.
Therefore, to overcome the underperformance issue, in May 2004, the government
introduced the GLC Transformation Programme. The main objective of this programme is to
improve the performance of GLCs and all corporate sectors so that they would perform
1

successfully. This transformation program is important as it is one of the journeys for the
organization to achieve Vision 2020. Quite a few GLCs have been successful in
implementing the programme, such as Telekom Malaysia, Malaysian Airport Holding Berhad
(MAHB), and United Engineering Malaysia (UEM) Group Berhad. These companies have
turned out to be more profitable and have been recognized internationally (Md Zin &
Sulaiman, 2011).
However, past studies still show that GLCs lack value creation compared to nonGLCs (Entebang, 2010; Mohamad & Said, 2011; Lau & Tong, 2008; Feng, and Sun, & Tong,
2004; Razak et al., 2011). Muslim, Hafiz, and Fekri Ali (2012) state that GLCs have suffered
from recurring poor firm performances due to the lack of value creation in their organization,
which has made them come under the government’s scrutiny. Razak et al. (2011) find that
non-GLCs’ performances are better than GLCs in terms of their corporate governance and
other forms of specific characteristics, which makes them create more value than GLCs. This
is because GLCs do not focus too much on maximizing profits, as they are also concerned
about contributing towards nation building (Lau & Tong, 2008).
Several GLCs are unable to create value and thus suffer from poor performances such
as the Malaysian Airline System (MAS) and Proton Holding Berhad. Hence, GLCs need to
put in extra initiatives to create value so that they will be able to meet the requirements and
expectations of the government and at the same time, be able to increase and add value to
their products, services, and business performance (Lawler & Mohrman, 2013; Aziz et al.,
2015a,b,c; Said et al., 2015, 2016). Khazanah (2014) states that GLCs are expected to
improve and enhance their value creation by focusing on sustainable practices and execution
from 2015 onwards. Currently, GLCs, especially the G202 companies, have started to focus
on sustainable practices to achieve long-term value creation. However, some GLCs tend to
undermine the importance of sustainable practices as they have several goals to accomplish.
Moreover, there are currently limited researches done on value creation in Malaysian GLCs
(Lau & Tong, 2008).
Under this circumstance, this study investigates the practices of sustainable
competitive advantage strategies among different categories of Government-Linked
Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. Entrepreneurship is considered one of the most important
features for an organization to gain sustainable competitive advantage, boost performances,
and create value for the organization (Entebang, 2010; Lyon, Lumpkin, & Dess, 2000).
Without the existence of entrepreneurial orientation, there will be no new ideas and the
implementation of innovation is almost impossible. Koe (2013) states that entrepreneurial
orientation leads to value creation as it improves the performance of the organization, growth,
market share, and stakeholder satisfaction. Past studies have found that organizations that
perform corporate entrepreneurship obtain higher profits (Omar & Ishak, 2013; Che Omar,
Mohamad, & Abdul Kader, 2012; Entebang, Abu Mansor, & Puah, 2006; Antoncic &
Hisrich, 2003; Ferreira, 2002). In addition, entrepreneurship plays an important role in
emerging economies as it could increase productivity, improve best practices, create new
products and services, and enhance competitiveness (Entebang, Abu Mansor, & Puah, 2006;
Bruton, Ahlstrom, & Obloj, 2008).

G20 is the selection of large GLCs, which are controlled by GLICs under the GLCT Programme and is used as
a proxy for performance of the GLCs. However, the G20 currently consists of only 17GLCs due to mergers,
demergers, divestments, and other corporate exercises over the years.

The role of entrepreneurship and its effect on GLCs’ value creation remains
unexplored, because GLCs have limited autonomy and flexibility compared to private
companies, such as having limited resources (Entebang, 2010). Some GLCs refuse to deal
with risky investments as they feel that their normal business activities are already risky and
challenging (Omar & Ishak, 2013). In addition, according to Zahra, Ireland, and Hitt (2000),
most GLCs do not engage in entrepreneurial-oriented behavior because of the limited
resources and capabilities. However, in GLCs, entrepreneurial orientation is important, as it
leads to the renewal or creation of new businesses or products and supports innovation.
Moreover, the formation of GLCs has led to entrepreneurship behaviour among the public
and government-related agencies as privatization provides an environment that encourages
entrepreneurial activities (Antoncic & Hisrich, 2003). The Prime Minister of Malaysia, YAB
Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Haji Abdul Razak, states that innovation and entrepreneurship has the
ability to create competitive advantages, value creation and improve the quality of life of the
society (Science2action, 2011). In addition, by recognizing the importance of innovation and
entrepreneurial orientation, the government has decided to create a more entrepreneurial
environment so that organizations would be engaged in a high-tech based undertaking and
have the ability to meet the demands of the market. According to Koe (2013), GLCs need to
be more entrepreneurial than bureaucratic, as it will enable organizations to create value and
improve their performances. Therefore, this study investigates the practices of entrepreneurial
orientation as a strategy of sustainable competitive advantage among different categories of
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia.
2. Methodology
2.1 Sampling and Data Collection
The data for this study are collected based on a questionnaire survey among 134 executives
and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The survey was conducted between February and April
of 2015.
2.2 Measurements of Variables
This study uses seven parameters to measure the practices of entrepreneurial orientation
adopted from Hornsby, Kuratko, and Zahra (2000). The practices of entrepreneurial
orientation are measured based on the management support for corporate entrepreneurship.
The factors are as follows:
E1
E2
E3
E4
E5
E6
E7

Individual risk takers are often recognized for their willingness to champion
new projects, whether it eventually turns out to be successful or not.
Employees are often encouraged to take calculated risks with new ideas.
The term “risk taker” is considered a positive attribute for people in the
organization.
Organization supports many small and experimental projects realizing that
some will undoubtedly fail.
Organization is actively searching for business opportunities.
Key executives are risk-takers in exploring business opportunities.
The top management of the organization considers rapid growth as a dominant
goal.

The respondents are asked to compare all the practices of innovation in their
organization against their competitors in the same industry for at least three years. The

questionnaire uses a five-point Likert rating scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree).
2.3 Data Analysis
The data are analysed using descriptive statistics. Factor analysis is used to measure the
consistency of the data. Further, the reliability of the data is tested using the Cronbach’s alpha
test. Finally, the data validity is tested by checking the normality of data through skewness
and kurtosis.

Among all of the factors of entrepreneurial orientation, the highest mean score is 4.07
for the factor of looking for new business opportunities (E5), and the lowest mean score is
3.57 for the factor of supporting many small and experimental projects realizing that some
will undoubtedly fail (E4) (Table 2). The average mean value is 3.78. There is scope to
improve the overall entrepreneurial orientation by emphasizing on the factors that are below
the average score such as individual risk takers need to be recognized for their willingness to
champion new projects, whether it eventually turns out to be successful or not (E1),

employees need to be encouraged to take calculated risks with new ideas (E2), the term “risk
taker” needs to be considered a positive attribute for people in the organization (E3), and
many small and experimental projects are needed to be supported by realizing that some will
undoubtedly fail (E4).

Overall, the federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on the factors of
entrepreneurial orientation than the state owned GLCs (Table 3). Among the factors of
entrepreneurial orientation, both state and federal owned GLCs emphasize the most on
looking for new business opportunities (E5), while the state owned GLCs emphasize the least
on considering the term “risk taker” as a positive attribute for employee (E3), and federal
owned GLCs emphasize the least on supporting many small and experimental projects
realizing that some will undoubtedly fail (E4).
The GLCs engaged in the service sector are more focused on entrepreneurial
orientation than other sectors (Table 3). These service sector GLCs emphasize the most on
looking for new business opportunities (E5), and emphasize the least on supporting many
small and experimental projects realizing that some will undoubtedly fail (E4). The GLCs
engaged in the manufacturing sector place the most emphasis on recognizing individual risk
takers for their willingness to champion new projects, whether it eventually turns out to be
successful or not (E1), encouraging employees to take calculated risks with new ideas (E2)
and risk-taking by key executives in exploring business opportunities (E6), and the least
emphasis on supporting many small and experimental projects realizing that some will
undoubtedly fail (E4) as well as considering rapid growth as the dominant goal by top
management (E7).
3.3 Diagnostic Test
3.3.1 Consistency Test
The factor analysis provides the consistency of these variables for entrepreneurial orientation
measurement. The factor loadings for all the variables are more than 0.6 (Table 2). The
ranges of the loading value of the factor is from 0.68 (E7) to 0.87 (E1). This indicates that all
of the seven variables are good to measure the practices of entrepreneurial orientation in the
GLCs of Malaysia.
3.3.2 Normality Test
The normality test is performed to check the distribution of data. According to Pallant (2013),
the normality of the data can be described by using the skewness and kurtosis tests, where the
data can be considered normally distributed when the kurtosis value is between -3 to 3 and

the skewness value is below zero. For the factors of entrepreneurial orientation, the skewness
value is -0.746, and the kurtosis value is 1.20, which are within the acceptable range.
Therefore, the data can be considered as normally distributed.
3.3.3 Reliability Test
The Cronbach’s alpha (Table 4) value on entrepreneurial orientation is 0.89, which indicates
the reliability of the questions is excellent (George & Mallery, 2003). The eigenvalue for the
test indicates that the factor used in entrepreneurial orientation explains the 60.6% variance.
The Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test indicates a value greater than 0.6 at 0.869 (Chi-Square = 508, p
< 0.000). Therefore, the sample is adequate to be used in the factorial analysis. Generally, the
test supports the variables of entrepreneurial orientation in this study.

4. Conclusion and Recommendation
Malaysia has targeted to achieve Vision 2020 to become a developed nation, but there are
many more steps to be taken in importing value creation in GLCs. This study measured the
status of the current practices of entrepreneurial orientation among different categories of
GLCs in Malaysia by assessing seven related factors. The factor analysis provided the
consistency of these seven variables for entrepreneurial orientation measurement. 70.9% of
the respondents admitted to exercising these seven factors of entrepreneurial orientation, and
their average score was 3.78 out of a 5 scale.
Therefore, there is scope for improving the practices of entrepreneurial orientation by
the GLCs. Hence, the GLCs need to put in extra initiatives to create value so that they will be
able to meet the requirements and expectations of the government and at the same time, be
able to increase and add value to their products, services and business performance (Lawler
& Mohrman, 2013). Overall, GLCs should emphasize on recognizing individual risk takers
for their willingness to champion new projects, whether it eventually turns out to be
successful or not, encourage employees to take calculated risks with new ideas, consider the
term “risk taker” as a positive attribute for people in the organization, and support many
small and experimental projects by realizing that some will undoubtedly fail. However, the
state owned or federal owned GLCs and GLCs engaged in manufacturing or service sectors
should emphasize on more focused areas for their improvement.
