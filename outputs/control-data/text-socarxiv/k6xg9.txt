Abstract

This paper examines the prehistory and history of autism in the first half of the 20th century. The
prehistory focuses on Heller’s dementia Infantilis and Bleuler’s autism and schizophrenia. The more
formal history begins with Tramer (1924), and continues with Ssucharewa (1926), which still contains
some of the best descriptions of autism, although she called the condition schizoid psychopaths or
schizoid personality disorders. There is still debate about when and whether Asperger and Kanner read
Ssucharewa (1926), but the paper was republished in German in 1932 and quoted by Kanner, post his
1943 paper. The point is that Ssucharewa publication has precedents. George Frankl, the predecessor of
Hans Asperger by many years, in the Heilpadogik Clinic was therefore a key figure in the description of
autism in Vienna and later he went to America and worked under Leo Kanner, whom he described
autism to.

Introduction
The history of autism is very complicated. It has
changed hugely in recent years. This is what the
paper is about. In the past, there have been many
errors in the history of autism which this paper
elucidates. Recent scholarship has brought to light
a much more accurate and truthful history of
autism. This paper focuses mostly on the pre and
early history of autism in the 20th century.
There are unanswered questions about whether
Kanner knew about Ssucharewa’s (1926), paper
on schizoid personality disorder/schizoid
psychopaths which was published in German in
1932. Ssucharewa described what Kanner called,
“infantile autism” in 1926 and 1932. Could
Kanner whom most professionals believe
originated autism have known about Hans
Asperger’s paper, a later description of autism,
which he called autistic psychopathy published in
1938 before the Second World War? Could Hans
Asperger have known about Ssucharewa’s paper,
published in German in 1932 having been
published in Russian in 1926? These are critical
questions in relation to the precedence in the
discovery of autism. Final proof is not available.

First decade of the 20th Century:
In Heller’s disease, (1908), the patients regressed
during the third or fourth year, became restless,
angry, whined, showed anxiety, showed loss of
acquired functions, which in a few months, led to
mutism and dementia. Speech became
impoverished and words became unclear. Some
of these may have had autism.
Kanner (1937) pointed out that, “dementia
infantilis or Heller’s disease is an illness sui
generis”. Kanner was incorrect about this. It is on
the neurodevelopmental spectrum. The same can
be said about autism. Kanner also emphasised that
autism was, “sui generis”.
Indeed, these
conditions are not specific but are part of broader
neurodevelopmental spectrums. Indeed, they are
the opposite of sui generis.

Second decade of the 20th Century:
Bleuler, (1911), goes on to state, “even in those
cases where autism is not obvious at first glance, it
can be seen that the patients always went their

own way and did not allow anybody to approach
them”. This is typical of autism.
Bleuler (1911), points out that, “autism is almost
the same thing that Freud calls autoeroticism”.
Bleuler says that they, “limit as far as possible,
their contact with the outside world. They cut
themselves off.

Third decade of the 20th Century:
In 1924, Tramer wrote a paper on one-sidedly
talented and gifted imbeciles (Lyons, 2018).
Lyons, (2018) states that the cases described,
“might warrant a diagnosis of autism spectrum
disorder”. Interestingly, this is before the
Sukhareva (1926) paper. Tramer (1924),
describes one patient specialising in painting cats.
This patient reminds me of Louis Wain,
(Fitzgerald, 2002), who also had autism. Tramer,
(1934) stated that cats, “were his companions
from early childhood”. “He had an extraordinary
memory, possibly photographic, and his pictures
of cats were very sought after. His drawing is
described as compulsive, his whole life force, his
whole primitive will power was focused on
drawing”.
Many of the cases described by Tramer (1924)
possessed, “very idiosyncratic language”. Many
of them focused on drawings. One, “produced
amazing drawings of trains, houses, towns from
memory and did his drawings with amazing
speed”. Some of them spent time in psychiatric
hospitals. Some of them painted completely
original works, while others engaged mainly in,
“producing copies”. Another child had, “difficulty
sitting still in school, had his own fixed ideas,
worked with great intensity, was idiosyncratic,
oppositional/contradictory. He had very good
memory, both auditory and visual and great talent
for drawing. Also had many various special
interests, including plants, shells, house animals,
lamps, clocks etc. He was very interested in
mathematics which kept him awake at night”. He
had, “calendar, calculating skills”, (Tramer, 1926).
Another, “ignored the corrections made by his
teachers, had monotonous voice. His strength was
in mathematics and he used his own methods to
find solutions and was unable to do it in writing as
instructed by his teacher”. He had idiosyncratic
ways of solving maths problems”. He has, “an

excellent memory”. He liked, “order, he appeared
stiff and monotonous, is generally extremely
calm, however if challenged, he becomes violent,
only then to revert back to his cold calmness”,
(Tramer, 1924).
Another, “enjoyed torturing animals; has a sadistic
component; suffers from constant, almost daily
mood changes, has temper tantrums, throws
himself to the ground, pulls his hair out. He is
extraordinarily musical, has absolute pitch and
great memory”. Today, this would be described
as criminal autistic psychopathy, (Fitzgerald,
2010). Another produces, “astonishing
technical/architectural drawings without having
had previous training. He insists that his drawings
are the product of his own imagination and not
copies”, (Tramer, 1926).
The same could be said of so-called dementia
praecocissima by De Sanchez Sanctis (1925).
Some of these children would overlap with socalled Heller’s disease. Again, you have
regression around the fourth year, with catatonic
symptoms, stereotypical outbursts of anger,
echolalia and emotional blunting.
In terms of classic descriptions of autism, the story
begins in 1926 when Ssucharewa, a Russian
psychiatrist wrote her paper on schizoid
psychopaths in children. This is a paper and
contains the best descriptions of high functioning
autism, surpassing Leo Kanner and Hans
Asperger. She starts out with a discussion of
schizoid personality disorders of childhood, which
would now be called high functioning autism. She
mentions this by an, “artificial construct”, if one
were to believe Bumke, (1924). In actual fact,
Bumke was wrong to describe it as an artificial
concept. Ssucharewa, (1926), discusses the
relationship between schizoid personality and
schizoid in a very modern sense, which is still an
issue to this day. She points out that, “clinical
research into the prepsychotic personality of
people with schizophrenia, has shown this to be
similar to the picture of schizoid personality
disorder”.
She goes on to describe classic case histories of
high functioning autism which she calls schizoid
personality. These case histories have family
histories which are very commonly found in
autism today. Some of the issues in the family
histories include, “outbursts of anger;

pathologically suspicious”, obsessional states”,
“poor adaptive capacities”, “anxiously passive,
afraid of empty rooms”. Other features in the
family histories of these patients were, “odd
thought processes”, schizophrenia, eccentric and
irritable. Also included in the family histories are
comments like, “extremely shy, only sociable
within a small intimate circle, colourless
personality, with heightened suggestibility and
poor
adaptive
capacities”,
dominating,
quarrelsome, suspicious and miserly, intelligent,
obstinate, quarrelsome, egocentric, children
preferring adult company, dominating and
despotic, eccentric, played alone and thought up
his own games, mathematically gifted, stubborn,
clumsy. These features in the family histories of
the patients with high functioning autism/schizoid
personality that she describes would be part of a
broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders;
the typical kind of family histories we see in our
patients with autism today. We are very familiar
in our histories today of persons with autism
having family histories of persons with
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism etc.
In terms of etiology of the schizoid conditions she
mentions, “inborn abnormality of certain brain
regions, (cerebellum, basal ganglia, frontal
lobes)”, even though this was written in 1926.
The case histories show evidence of meeting
some of the criteria for autism spectrum disorder
DSM 5 (APA 2013). Children were, “shy, easily
frightened and suspicious… shunned the
company of other children”. She describes one
having, “unusual interest in death”, and death
anxiety is very common in children with autism
today, who are able to speak and tell us about it.
Things that she described include repetitive
language, restless sleep, being very good at music,
having concentration problems, basically today
these would be described as attention deficit
disorder DSM 5 (APA 2013). Motor descriptions
were described by her in detail and she described
motor movements as being, “clumsy and
awkward”, “gait clumsy and awkward”, being
avid readers, having, “droopy and lax joints”.
The social relationship difficulties she described
would be typical of autism. She described
wandering aimlessly. She also described, “playing
the joker, and becoming the butt of peers”. She
describes talking and behaving like an adult. She

describes one patient as being nick-named, “the
talking machine”. She describes the
hypersensitivity of the children to any criticism.
She describes their preservation of sameness, and
their intense persistence in activity. She describes
their heightened suggestibility and their clowning
and their impulsive odd behaviour. She describes
the children reared in orphanages who came out
with a very similar phenotype to the one that she
has described and which we are very familiar now
from the psychological studies of children in
orphanages, (Rutter. 1998). She describes no
intellectual decline as compared to schizophrenia.
Some of the language problems she described
include talking incessantly, rhyming, endless
questioning, monotonous tone of voice. She
describes talking like an adult. She describes
attraction to abstract ideas, to philosophy.
She goes on at great length looking at the
relationship between autism and schizophrenia
which we still haven’t sorted out today and the
comments that she made about that relationship,
and are still being debated today, (Fitzgerald,
2012).
In 1941, Bradley purchased probably the only
book on Kanner’s subject childhood
schizophrenia in America. It is very likely that
Kanner read it since it was the only book
published in America on his topic, in that
particular year. This book contains references to
Sukhareva, (Ssucharewa). This is a critical piece
of information on the origins of autism.
Leo Kanner does quote this second publication in
1932 in his article in 1949 (Kanner, 1949). He
quotes it again in his text book; “Child
Psychiatry”, (Kanner, 1972). The big question
which is unresolved is whether he was aware of
the Russian paper, published in 1926. This would
have antedated his meetings with Frankl, who
gave him the autistic profile from his clinic in
Vienna where he worked with Hans Asperger. It
is likely he did read it because he was a linguist
and knew the literature in extraordinary detail and
that he did read it in the 1930s. The latest he could
have read it would have been 1941, when it was
in Bradley’s book. In addition to this, he spoke
German, and could have read the 1932 paper. He
was massively well read in the German literature
and spoke German. In this paper, Ssucharewa,
(1926) does also use the word, “autistic reactions”.

Ssucharewa (1926) also uses the phrase, “an
autistic attitude”. She also has a very good
discussion on the boundaries between psychiatric
conditions and between, “sick and healthy
people”, which is very modern sounding. This
paper (1926/1932) should be on the essential
reading list of every psychiatrist in training.
Manouilenko and Bejerot (2015), pointed out that
Sukhareva (1959) replaced the term, “schizoid
psychopathy”, with, “autistic (pathological
avoidant) psychopathy”. Clearly, she was
influenced by Hans Asperger in the change of
name, but the names are simply synonyms. Of
course, Frankl, Weiss and Zak taught Hans
Asperger
about
autistic
psychopathy.
Manouilenko et al, (2015), pointed out that,
“Asperger, (1944), specifically stated that his aim
was to report on a personality disorder already
manifest in childhood, which to his knowledge
had not yet been described”. This is remarkably
similar to Kanner’s description of autism, making
the same claim that it had not yet been described.
It is very puzzling to know why Asperger hadn’t
referenced Sukhareva since it was in the German
literature which he was very familiar with. Most
of the people that he quoted of course in his article
in 1944 had Nazi leanings or were members of
the Nazi party. In addition, Russia was at war with
Germany at this time, which might explain his
reluctance to reference a Russian. The Gestapo, if
they read his papers, wouldn’t have appreciated a
Russian citation. Asperger was held in the highest
regard by the Gestapo during the Second World
War and this has been documented many times
(Sheefer, 2018).
What is extraordinary is that Gerhard Bosch’s
book published in 1962 in German makes no
reference to Sukhareva, when she had published
in German. Possibly this gives us a warning about
how easily publications can be missed, even if
they’re in the person’s own language. This book,
by Bosch, was re-published in 1970.
Georg Frankl started working in the
Heilpedagogical clinic in 1927 and Silberman
(2015) states that, “Frankl became Asperger’s
chief diagnostician”. Indeed, it’s quite different
from this. It was Frankl who basically mentored
and taught Asperger about child psychiatry and
about autism. Frankl taught Asperger when he
arrived at the Heilpadogik Clinic and later taught

Fitzgerald, MM. The history of autism in the first half century of the 20th century: new and revised

Kanner when he went to work with him in the
United States.
In 1928, Sister Viktorine Zak, who was the chief
nurse in the Heilpedagogical Clinic, in an article
described the method that led to the diagnosis of
autism. Sheefer, (2018) in translation noted that
Zak, “urged caregivers to recognise uniqueness of
all children through evaluation of their
“characters”, because, “the personality shows
itself in small things”, and, “staff should focus on
minute observations and, “minute diagnosis”, and,
“to experience the child’s thought processes
empathically”. This is how autism came to be
discovered. The 1928 (Zak) article was published
in The International Council of Nurses (Sheefer,
2018).
Further relevant comments in the literature
include Gruhle (1929) who describes an,
“extreme feeling of loneliness” and, “inability of
the patients to adjust themselves emotionally to
their surroundings or to project themselves into
the emotional lives of others”, (Bosch, 1970).
Binder, (1930) notes that in persons with schizoid
autism there was a tendency, “to cling to self”, and
to “shrivel up”.
Asperger arrived in the clinic in 1932. He was
very inexperienced and really a trainee, (Sheefer,
2018). It was shortly after graduation.
Because Asperger was a, “good Natural
Socialist”, he was appointed director of the clinic
in 1934. This was over Frankl, who was Jewish,
(Sheefer, 2018).

Psychosis, 1937:
Kanner, (1937) described a classic case of autism
as major psychosis over ten years after Sukhareva
described the classic profile. Kanner was mistaken
here with his psychosis diagnosis when he
described the child who was, “throwing his hands
about”, in a peculiar fashion, very fretful as a
baby, always crying, severe temper tantrums,
throwing knives and scissors at his sister. He
twitched his shoulders with a crowd and had other
tics. He was inattentive, restless and preoccupied
in school. He failed in the third and fifth grades. It
took him a great deal of time to put his clothes on
in the morning. He required a great deal of
independent support, despite being intelligent. He
had feeding problems and would dawdle over his
meals. He was scared by the reflection of the

street lights on the ceiling. He was a reclusive
youngster who preferred to play alone. He liked to
read, “deep books”. He had major narrow
interests. He was very irritable. Kanner’s book
was published in 1937 and clearly, he knew
nothing about autism at that time. One assumes
that he wrote it during 1935/1936 for publication
in 1937. His introduction to autism was going to
come from Frankl and Weiss who came from
Aspergers’ department in Vienna to work with
Kanner just after this time. Frankl arrived in 1938
to Kanner’s clinic.
In 1935, Anni Weiss published a paper in the
American Journal of Orthopsychiatry on,
“qualitative intelligence testing as a means of
diagnosis in the examination of psychopathic
children”. Kanner had his textbook of child
psychiatry written at this time. At that time, autism
would have been included under the label,
“psychopathic” in Vienna. She describes a classic
autism case which Kanner didn’t reference in
1943. Kanner tended to avoid any references to
precedents before his 1943 paper. The case she
describes is a classic case of autism and of course,
Weiss did also work with Kanner before the
Second World War. This child was strange and
one-sided in his behaviour. He had huge social
interactional skills deficits. Weiss (1935) describes
his, “extreme nervousness and his queer and
helpless behaviour in his intercourse with other
children”. He was, “afraid of children”. He was
afraid of, “loud noises”, and was, “very clumsy
and helpless”. Disturbances of routine upset him.
Children called him, “the fool”. His grandmother,
who was looking after him, thought that he was
clever. Of course, his huge problem was his
autistic social interactional skills difficulties. His,
“muscular system (was) weak”. He, “held himself
badly, his arms dangling and his head generally
hanging forward. His movements were awkward
and without vigour”. He had, “a monotonous way
of speaking”. He lacked the ability for, “selfpreservation and self-defence”, (Weiss, 1935).
There is no reference to this paper (Weiss, 1935)
in Kanner’s (1973) collected papers on Childhood
Psychosis or in his 1943 paper.
In 1935, Joseph Michaels published an important
paper in relation to the history of autism. It was
published in the American Journal of
Orthopsychiatry, one of the journals that Kanner

Editorial

published in (Kanner, 1949). It was called The
Heilpedagogical Station of the Children’s Clinic
at the University of Vienna. What was particularly
interesting about that paper is that Hans Asperger
who was there in a very minor role at the clinic at
that time, so minor that he wasn’t even
mentioned. He was a trainee. The only two people
mentioned in relation to the work there at that time
was Anni Weiss and Georg Frankl. Sheefer
(2018), makes a very important comment on that
paper in relation to the word, “autistic”. She states
that, “Michaels also suggested the staff’s casual
and shared use of the term, “autistic”. He,
(Michaels, 1935), described their concept of,
“artistic children”. Assuming, “artistic”, is an
English mistranslation of, “autistic” since art is
nowhere near his reference – Michael describes
how, “artistic children may require special
personal guidance”, because they have difficulties
joining the, “group”, as frequently their attention
and feelings are elsewhere”. I believe Sheefer is
correct and it’s impossible to believe that Leo
Kanner never read this paper, since it was on one
of his regular journals, where he published.
Sheffer describes, “in 1934, Frankl describes
those who, when, “surrounded in a group of
children”, do not sense the atmosphere and so
cannot adapt”. This is classic autism. Sheefer
points out that, “Frankl believed this was due to
the youth’s “poor understanding of the emotional
content of the spoken word”. (Translation Sheffer
2018).
In 1937, Frankl (Sheefer, 2018, page 56), noted
that, “the youth’s detachment and disobedience
did not represent their true emotions behind their,
“mask-like faces” – which could, “frequently lead
to severe misunderstandings”. According to
Sheefer (2018), Frankl listed several conditions
that might lead to milder social idiosyncrasies and
that, “he distinguished the children he was
describing from those he saw as much more
impaired, who had, “extreme autism”, (Autismus;
emphasis in the original), and were, “autistically
locked”. It’s very clear where Asperger would
have got his training in autism and it was from
Frankl, Weiss and Zak and his ideas on autistic
psychopathy when he gave his lecture in 1938.
Shortly after both of those publications, Leo
Kanner had Weiss and Frankl working for him
and training him in “Autismus”.

Desperet (1938), described children who showed,
“unsociability, withdrawal, a tendency to
dreaming, fearfulness of new affective context,
irritability,
sometimes
hyperactivity
or
aggressiveness, a tendency to live in their own
world”, which she called schizophrenia.
Georg Frankl arrived in Kanner’s clinic in 1938
and evaluated one of the first patients that Kanner
used in his 1943 paper in that year. I assume this
is what Kanner means by 1938 in his 1943 paper.
Georg Frankl was a senior psychiatrist in the
Heilpedagogical Station of the Children’s Clinic
in 1932 when Hans Asperger arrived and was a
rather minor figure there, really little more than a
psychiatric resident in psychiatry. Asperger,
because of his commitment to national socialism
and not being a Jew was promoted as director of
the clinic over Georg Frankl in 1934. This was
Asperger’s first major benefit from national
socialism and was the beginning of the slippery
slope for him, which led to the referral of patients
for euthanasia, (Sheefer, 2018).

Fourth decade of the 20th century:
Bender and Schilder’s (1940), description of
impulsions: a specific disorder of behaviour of
children were describing autism spectrum
disorder before Kanner. They describe these
children as, “preoccupied with certain activities
such as continuously looking at and handling an
object, counting and talking about numbers,
turning door knobs, drawing specific objects or
excessive walking … hoarding, stubbornly
fighting any interference with poor adjustments at
school, (Kanner, 1972).
Kretschmer (1942), points out that, “the
characteristics chiefly responsible for the
development of autism are to be found in the area
of temperament. For him, autism was, “a schizoid
type of temperament”, and he describes two
types; (1) where there is, “a painful contraction
into oneself”, while the other is an, “inactive and
contemplative dream life, type”. For Kretschmer,
“the patient is cramped and numb at the same
time”.
In 1942, Frankl sent Kanner his paper on children
with problems with affective contact, a key event
in the understanding of the origins of autism. This
was mentioned in a letter by Kanner, (Robinson,
2016). Kanner sent this letter to the publisher of

Fitzgerald, MM. The history of autism in the first half century of the 20th century: new and revised

the Journal Nervous Child which Kanner was
editing. Kanner stated that he had received a paper
from Georg Frankl (1942), about children with
affective contact problems and that he was going
to write a paper on the same topic himself and this
became the 1943 paper. Of course, Frankl had
trained Kanner on autism from 1938 to 1943 and
indeed, some of Frankl’s cases are documented
by Kanner in his 1943 paper. There needs to be
no more mystery about the year 1938 which was
the year that Frankl arrived to work with Kanner
in Baltimore or where Kanner got his idea of
autism from.
There is wide knowledge about Kanner’s 1943
paper. It was only since Van Krevelen (1962,
1971), and Lorna Wing, (1981), brought
Asperger’s 1944 paper to the attention of the
English-speaking world. Indeed, one of Van
Krevelen’s papers was published in Kanner’s
journal, the Journal of Autism and Childhood
Schizophrenia, as it was called at that time. This
shows that Kanner knew of Asperger’s 1944
paper because he was the editor of the journal.
In the fourth edition of Kanner’s (1972) textbook
on child psychiatry, he quotes over twelve
hundred authors from all over the world. One
thing is certain; he was a linguist and was vastly
knowledgeable about the literature on child
psychiatry and because he spoke many languages,
more knowledgeable about the literature in child
psychiatry than any other child psychiatrist at the
time, or possibly since. Frankl and Weiss are
absent from this vast author list as are their papers.
Silberman (2015), has elaborated on these
historical issues in his book, “Neurotribes”. This
paper here extends historical knowledge beyond
“Neurotribes” and provides further historical
information.
