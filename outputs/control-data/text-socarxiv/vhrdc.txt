Spatial Information and the Legibility of Urban Form:
Big Data in Urban Morphology
Geoff Boeing1
University of Southern California

Abstract: Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical cartography and
visual communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial patterns, propose designs,
compare alternatives, and engage the public. Classic urban form visualizations – from
Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s figure-ground diagrams
of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible
information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart
Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in
an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer
new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This
paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and
morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring
urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and
data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping
platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different
study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age
of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide
urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

1. Introduction
Information management is an important component of urban research and praxis. Datadriven modeling and exploration of cities entail cycles of information management activities –
from data acquisition and transformation, to structuring and interpreting data to produce
useful information, to knowledge dissemination for planning and advocacy. This paper
considers urban morphology through these information management processes in the Smart
Cities paradigm.

The Smart Cities paradigm aims to understand cities through user-generated content,
ubiquitous sensing, and automatically harvested data (Batty et al., 2012). While this often
takes the form of a modernized cybernetics through top-down monitoring, optimization, and
control, there is greater potential in this paradigm’s critical turn to richer problem sets
(Goodspeed, 2015; Kitchin, 2016). Rather than considering livability as an optimization
problem, planners might use urban data to enrich socio-political processes of community
advocacy, understanding, consensus-forming, and public decision-making. Critical
approaches might identify sampling biases in user-generated content to adjust for overrepresentation of certain groups in these datasets and to foreground marginalized voices.
User-generated spatial data can be used to introspectively unpack planning and design
histories and the spatial logics they have manifested in different places as a function of era,
politics, culture, and local economic conditions. Interpretative and narrative approaches can
enrich and contextualize data-driven urban morphology (Erin et al., 2017; Moudon, 1997).
Spatial information (and in turn information management) plays a central role in this
space as nearly all urban and human processes are spatially-situated. In particular, this paper
reflects on user-contributed big data about spatial infrastructure that allow us to examine the
physical substrate that constrains and shapes the flows of people, goods, and information
through urban space (Batty, 2013). Street networks are the paradigmatic example of such
infrastructure. Researchers have explored these networks in recent years to model trips and
traffic, to uncover fundamental patterns in city organization, and to explore urban planning
and design histories. OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a worldwide mapping community and online
geospatial information system – has played an increasingly key role in these streams of
scholarship as it provides a freely available, high quality source of data on street networks and
other urban infrastructure worldwide (Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball, 2017; Jokar
Arsanjani et al., 2015).
This paper builds on recent work by Crooks et al. (2016) – who argued that big data
is an underexplored, emerging frontier in urban morphology – to introduce and review
examples of analyses that help to reveal and explain the urban form. In particular, it focuses
on a motivating question: how can user-contributed big data be collected, organized, and
modeled to explore the various spatial logics resulting from urban planning, design, and
evolution? It takes up Crooks et al.’s call to develop workflows that integrate both data-driven
and qualitative (i.e., interpretive or narrative) methods of urban morphology in today’s era of
ubiquitous urban big data. Situating this theoretical work in the visual culture of planning,
this paper presents a visualization-mediated interpretative process of urban morphology.
This paper is organized as follows. First it situates analytical cartography within the
theoretical framework of the visual culture of planning, which has traditionally sought to
visualize urban space to understand city presents and futures (Gage, 2009; Gissen, 2008;
Jacobs, 1984; Shanken, 2018; Söderström, 1996; Tobler, 1976) – from Nolli maps (Hwang and
Koile, 2005; Verstegen and Ceen, 2013) to figure-ground street diagrams (Jacobs, 1995) to
rose diagrams (Mohajeri and Gudmundsson, 2014). Then it discusses an information

2

management workflow for collecting, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing OSM big data
using open source tools like OSMnx and computational methodologies. Finally, it considers
what these data-driven techniques reveal about different places and modes of urbanization
before discussing implications for the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities. It argues
that such historically- and culturally-informed quantitative methods are essential for
understanding the patterns and forms resulting from urban processes.

2. Spatial Information and Urban Form
Much like the broader field of information management, many of the former central
challenges in collecting, storing, and sharing spatial data have now evolved into commonplace
processes and standardized platforms to largely alleviate technical burden. Today, greater
emphasis belongs to the role that spatial information systems play in shaping urban patterns
and processes from travel behavior, to housing markets and gentrification, to the ways in
which planners, designers, and citizens engage with spatial information (Batty, 2005; EvansCowley and Griffin, 2012). This engagement is critical both for evidence-based city planning
as well as for collaborative community-building in an era of ubiquitous technology. In
particular, the Smart Cities paradigm today aims to quantify and measure urban patterns and
processes in a positivist approach to understanding, controlling, and improving cities through
information technology (Angelo and Vormann, 2018; Kitchin, 2016; Krivý, 2018; Townsend,
2015; Watson, 2015). As an epistemological project, Smart Cities research and practice take
many diverse forms (Albino et al., 2015; Ismagilova et al., 2019; Lytras and Visvizi, 2018;
Stone et al., 2018; Visvizi et al., 2018).
One such subject of urban morphology research today intersects Smart Cities,
computational geometry, and network science to explore the patterns of urban form and
circulation through large, harvested, user-generated data sets. Scholars have investigated this
to explore travel behavior, public health and safety, and residential sorting (Ewing and
Cervero, 2010; Hajrasouliha and Yin, 2015; Levinson and El-Geneidy, 2009; Marshall et al.,
2014; Porta et al., 2012; Southworth and Ben-Joseph, 1995; Xiao et al., 2016; Zhong et al.,
2014). Spatial information plays an important role in urban simulation for community
visioning (Vanegas et al., 2009; Waddell et al., 2018), streetscape quality analysis (Shen et al.,
2018), and predicting urban attributes from street imagery (Arietta et al., 2014). Another
research stream examines the spatial ordering of cities’ configuration and orientation through
circulation network patterns (Barthelemy et al., 2013; Barthelemy, 2017; Boeing, 2019; Buhl et
al., 2006; Chan et al., 2011; Courtat et al., 2011; Gudmundsson and Mohajeri, 2013; Louf and
Barthelemy, 2014; Mohajeri et al., 2013b; Mohajeri and Gudmundsson, 2012, 2014). Various
spatial logics and ordering principles exist in planned, unplanned, formal, informal, gridded,
and organic urban patterns (Kostof, 1991; Rose-Redwood and Bigon, 2018; Smith, 2007) –
and a city without one single, formal, geometric ordering logic may have well-defined, highfunctioning physical and social structure (Hanson, 1989).

3

Data-driven urban morphology seeks to explore urban form and spatial order –
modeling spatial data to trace histories, configurations, and orientations in physical space –
but requires a grounding in narrative and interpretative approaches to reveal the nuance of
local context and history. The urban historian Spiro Kostof (1991, p. 10) said: “Form, in itself,
is very lamely informative of intention. We ‘read’ form correctly only to the extent that we are
familiar with the precise cultural conditions that generated it… The more we know about
cultures, about the structure of society in various periods of history in different parts of the
world, the better we are able to read their built environment.” That is, urban spatial data must
be contextually interpreted to become meaningful information. Kostof (ibid., p. 11) continues:
“There is no point in noticing the formal similarities between L’Enfant’s plan for Washington
and the absolutist diagrams of Versailles or Karlsruhe… unless we can elaborate on the nature
of the content that was to be housed within each, and the social premises of the designers.”
Here we specifically situate such visual thinking within the theoretical frameworks
developed by Söderström (1996), Gissen (2008), and Shanken (2018). Söderström traces the
distinct histories of cartography, geography, and postmodernity, arguing that the visual
representation of urban form undergirds the scientific mode of studying cities. This visual
thinking renders abstract spatial information legible to planners and citizens. Gissen explores
the historical and still evolving visual-analytical links between architecture and geography,
arguing that datascapes and visualization mediate the differences between empirical research
traditions and the creative process of urban design. Shanken argues that urban planners have
employed a constellation of visual methods to analyze spatial information and represent the
city. This representational visual culture was historically exemplified by Giambattista Nolli’s
eighteenth century ichnographic study of Rome, producing the famous figure-ground Nolli
Maps of the urban fabric (Hwang and Koile, 2005; Verstegen and Ceen, 2013). Two centuries
later, this particular methodology was explored anew by Allan Jacobs’ (1995) comparative
visual study of dozens of urban street networks around the world.
This paper takes up where these traditional manual workflows left off to explore new
computational, automated, big data methods through three demonstrative questions
important to urban morphology research. 1) How do street networks embody specific spatial
logics to organize city dynamics? 2) How do their orientations and configurations vary across
places accordingly? 3) How can we visualize these complex patterns to render their
information legible to planners and citizens using modern computational workflows and
spatial big data?

3. Working with OpenStreetMap Data
This paper explores these questions using case studies in a small set of cities and building
models of urban street networks from OSM raw data using OSMnx, a Python package to
automate and streamline OSM spatial data acquisition and analysis (Boeing, 2017). Alone,
OSM’s spatial information system and its various APIs can be challenging to synthesize and

4

work with in nuanced and theoretically-sound ways (particularly for planning practitioners):
its raw data do not lend themselves automatically to urban form/network analysis and its
custom query languages can be cumbersome for scripting. OSMnx allows researchers and
practitioners to easily download street network, building, and amenity data for any study site
in the world, then automatically construct them into street network graphs or spatial data
frames for built-in visualization and statistical analysis. This empowers new ways of engaging
with this massive repository of global spatial information.
These models are nonplanar directed multigraphs, where graph nodes represent
intersections and dead-ends, and graph edges represent the street segments linking them
(Barnes and Harary, 1983; Cardillo et al., 2006; Lin and Ban, 2013; Marshall et al., 2018;
Trudeau, 1994). OSMnx allows users to download spatial data from OSM for any study site
boundary in the world, automatically construct it into a model that conforms to urban design
and transportation planning conventions, and then analyze and visualize it (Boeing, 2017).
OSM is a valuable source of geospatial data as it has worldwide coverage, generally high
quality, and an active collaborative user community (Barron et al., 2014; Basiri et al., 2016;
Corcoran et al., 2013; Girres and Touya, 2010; Haklay, 2010; Jokar Arsanjani et al., 2015; Neis
et al., 2011; Over et al., 2010; Zielstra et al., 2013).
This paper employs two visualization methods to illustrate urban morphology
through street patterns. First, it uses OSMnx to produce figure-ground diagrams of street
networks and building footprints to compress urban form complexity, illustrate urban design,
and communicate planning decisions and histories. These are inspired by Allan Jacobs’s
(1995) classic book on street-level urban form and design, which featured dozens of handdrawn figure-ground diagrams in the general style of Nolli maps, depicting built versus open
space to illustrate street network patterns. We adapt this cartographic methodology to a
computational, big data workflow to likewise depict one square mile of multiple cities’ street
networks, considering similarities and differences. Plotting cities at the same scale provides a
revealing spatial objectivity in visually comparing their street networks and urban forms.
The second method uses rose diagrams of street orientations to visualize the spatial
ordering of urban circulation infrastructure (Gudmundsson and Mohajeri, 2013; Mohajeri et
al., 2013a, 2013b; Mohajeri and Gudmundsson, 2014, 2012). First we calculate the compass
bearings of all the street segments in 25 world cities, then visualize them with a rose diagram
in which the bars’ directions represent 10° bins around the compass, and the bars’ lengths
represent the relative frequency of street segments that fall in each bin (Boeing, 2019). This
produces a visual representation of the extent to which a street network follows the spatial
ordering of a low entropy grid versus having streets oriented evenly in all compass directions.

4. Urban Circulation Systems and Spatial Logics
Figure 1 shows one square mile figure-ground diagrams from 12 cities around the world. At
the top-left, Portland, Oregon and San Francisco, California typify the late nineteenth century

5

American orthogonal grid (Cole, 2014; Marshall et al., 2015; Southworth and Ben-Joseph,
1997, 1995). Portland’s famously compact, walkable, 200-foot × 200-foot blocks are clearly
visible but its grid is interrupted by the Interstate 405 freeway which tore through the central
city in the 1960s (Mesh, 2014; Speck, 2012). In the middle-left, the business park in suburban
Irvine, California demonstrates the coarse-grained, modernist, auto-centric form that
characterized American urbanization in the latter half of the twentieth century (Hayden,
2004; Jackson, 1985; Jacobs, 1995).
In stark contrast, Rome has a more fine-grained, complex, organic form which
evolved over millennia of self-organization and urban planning (Taylor et al., 2016).
Representing each of these street networks here at the same scale – one square mile – it is easy
to compare the qualitative urban patterns in these different cities to one another. Contrast the
order of the nineteenth century orthogonal grid in San Francisco and the functionalist
simplifications of twentieth century Irvine to the messy, complex mesh of pedestrian paths,
passageways, and alleys constituting the circulation network in the ancient center of Rome.

Figure 1. One square mile of each city’s street network. The consistent spatial scale allows us to
easily compare different kinds of street networks and urban forms in different kinds of places.

6

At the top- and middle-right, we see New York, Paris, Tunis, and Atlanta. Midtown
Manhattan’s rectangular grid originates from the New York Commissioners’ Plan of 1811,
which laid out its iconic 800-foot × 200-foot blocks approximately 29 degrees off true North
(Ballon, 2012; Koeppel, 2015). Broadway weaves diagonally across it, revealing the path
dependence of the old Wickquasgeck Trail’s vestiges, which Native American residents used
to traverse the length of the island long before the first Dutch settlers arrived (Holloway, 2013;
Shorto, 2004).
At the center of the Paris square mile lies the Arc de Triomphe, from which Baron
Haussmann’s streets radiate outward as remnants of his massive demolition and renovation
of nineteenth century Paris (Hall, 1996). The spatial signatures of Haussmann’s project can
clearly be seen via network analysis through the redistribution of betweenness centralities and
block sizes (Barthelemy et al., 2013). At the center of the Tunis square mile lies its Medina,
with a complex urban fabric that evolved over the middle ages (Kostof, 1991; Micaud, 1978).
Finally, Atlanta is typical of many American downtowns: coarse-grained, disconnected, and
surrounded by freeways (Allen, 1996; Grable, 1979; Jackson, 1985; Kruse, 2007; Rose, 2001).
The bottom row of Figure 1 shows square miles of Boston, Dubai, Sacramento, and
Osaka. The central Boston square mile includes the city’s old North End – beloved by Jane
Jacobs (1961) for its lively streets, but previously cut-off from the rest of the city by the
Interstate 93 freeway. This freeway has since been undergrounded as part of the “Big Dig”
megaproject to alleviate traffic and re-knit the surface-level urban fabric (Flyvbjerg, 2007;
Robinson, 2008). The Dubai square mile shows Jumeirah Village Circle, a master-planned
residential suburb designed in the late 2000s by the Nakheel corporation, a major Dubai real
estate developer (Boleat, 2005; Haine, 2013; Kubat et al., 2009). Its street network
demonstrates a hybrid of the whimsical curvilinearity of the garden cities movement and the
ordered geometry of modernism. The Sacramento square mile depicts its northeastern
residential suburb of Arden-Arcade and demonstrates Southworth and Ben-Joseph’s (1997)
“warped parallel” and “loops and lollipops” design patterns of late twentieth century
American urban form.
Finally, the Osaka square mile portrays Fukushima-ku, a mixed-use but primarily
residential neighborhood first urbanized during the late nineteenth century. Today, the
freeway we see in the upper-right of this square mile infamously passes through the center of
the high-rise Gate Tower Building’s fifth through seventh floors (Yakunicheva, 2014). This
peculiar intermingling of street network and edifice arose when transportation planners were
forced to compromise with private landowners seeking to redevelop their property, despite
the prior designation of the freeway’s alignment (Isaac, 2014).
To qualitatively compare urban spatial forms in different kinds of places, these
visualizations depict a mix of modern central business districts, ancient historic quarters,
twentieth century business parks, and suburban residential neighborhoods. The cities they
represent are drawn from across the United States, Europe, North Africa, the Arabian
Peninsula, and East Asia. Yet street network patterns also vary greatly within cities: Portland’s

7

suburban east and west sides look different than its downtown, and Sacramento’s compact,
grid-like downtown looks different than its residential suburbs – a finding true of many
American cities (Boeing, 2018a). A single square mile diagram thus cannot be taken to be
representative of broader spatial scales or other locations within the municipality. These
visualizations, rather, show us how different urbanization patterns and paradigms compare at
the same scale, using automatically harvested user-generated data. This can serve both as a
practitioner’s tool for comprehending the physical outcomes of planning and informal
urbanization, as well as a tool for communicating urban planning and design in a clear and
immediate manner to laymen – leveraging spatial information to improve political
collaboration and multi-level co-governance.
These uses can be seen perhaps even more clearly when we use OSMnx to visualize
street networks along with OSM building footprints, as shown in Figure 2. At the top-left, we
see the densely built form of midtown Manhattan, with large buildings filling most of the
available space between streets. Within this square mile, there are 2,237 building footprints

Figure 2. One square mile of each city’s street network and building footprints, comparing US cities
to informal settlements in the Global South.

8

with a median area of 241 square meters. At the top-right, we see the medium-density
perimeter blocks of San Francisco’s Richmond district, just south of the Presidio. Here the
building footprints line the streets while leaving the centers of each block as open space for
residents. Within this square mile, there are 5,054 building footprints with a median area of
142 square meters. The bottom two images in Figure 2 reveal an entirely different mode of
urbanization by visualizing the slums of Monrovia, Liberia and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. These
informal settlements are much finer-grained and are not structured according to the orderly,
centralized planning of the American street grids in the top row. Monrovia’s square mile
contains 2,543 building footprints with a median area of 127 square meters. Port-au-Prince’s
square mile contains 14,037 building footprints with a median area of just 34 square meters.
OSM data and OSMnx provide planning practitioners an easy-to-use tool to visualize
and examine street networks and building footprints as a planning and communication tool.
The data in Figure 2, for instance, could help planners and residents in Monrovia and Portau-Prince collaboratively study how to percolate formal circulation networks into these
informal settlements with minimal disruption to the existing urban fabric, homes, and
livelihoods (Brelsford et al., 2019, 2018, 2015; Masucci et al., 2013; Zook et al., 2010).
Visualizing spatial information can also reveal the state assertion of power and
modernism’s inversion of traditional urban spatial order (Holston, 1989; Vale, 2008). In preindustrial cities, the figure dominates the ground as the diagram displays scattered open space
between buildings, as seen in Figure 3. But in modernist cities, the ground dominates the
figure as only a few scattered buildings are positioned as sculptural elements across the
landscape’s void. The modernist paradigm sought to open up the dense, messy, and complex
urban fabric with towers-in-the-park, spacing, highways, and functional simplicity (Boeing,
2018b; Fishman, 2011). This phenomenon is clearly seen in Brasília, the modernist capital of
Brazil, designed as a planned city in the 1950s by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer, and Roberto
Burle Marx (Figure 3). The structural order of the city also suggests “an ordering of social
relations and practices in the city” (Holston, 1989, p. 125). These figure-ground diagrams
provide a spatial data-driven method to in turn qualitatively interpret and study the urban
form and circulation networks that structure human activities and social relations.
The rose diagrams in Figure 4 offer another perspective on visualizing this structural
ordering of the city. Each polar histogram visualizes the orientation (compass bearing) of the
borough’s street segments, with bins representing 10-degrees around the compass and bar
lengths representing relative frequency (for complete methodological details and theoretical
development see Boeing, 2019). For example, in Manhattan’s rose diagram we can see the
spatial order produced by its dominant orthogonal grid (cf. Figure 1) as its street bearings are
primarily captured in four bins, offset from true North. The other boroughs have higher
entropy street orientations, not adhering as strictly to the ordering logic of a single grid. Such
an analysis can be performed with tools like QGIS or ArcGIS, but OSMnx helps to streamline
the workflow by automating the process of downloading the raw data, building the model,
and then allowing easy directionality analysis using Python libraries like geopandas and
matplotlib and the interactivity afforded by the Jupyter environment.

London, Paris, and Brasília reveal the modernist inversion of traditional urban spatial order.

Figure 5. Rose diagrams of the street orientations in 25 cities around the world.

In Figure 5 we see rose diagrams of 25 cities (municipalities) around the world. This
study scale aggregates heterogeneous neighborhoods into a single analytical whole, but offers
the benefit of capturing the scale of city planning jurisdiction to tell us about the spatial
ordering that the circulatory system provides. While some street networks in modern cities in
Canada, Australia, and China demonstrate similar low-entropy grids, far more of these cities
show higher entropy. That is, their streets are oriented more evenly in all compass directions
rather than following the spatial ordering logic of one or two consistent grids. The spatial
signature of the street grid is clearest in cities like Toronto and Beijing, while cities like Rome
and Rio de Janeiro demonstrate more-organic and less-orthogonal patterns. The patterns in
Beijing are interesting as they deviate from many of its Asian neighbors, instead conforming

11

more to the rationalist, centrally planned gridirons of Western cities like Toronto, Melbourne,
and Manhattan and suggesting a certain spatial logic undergirding its massive and rapid
urbanization in recent years.

5. Discussion
Through the tools of urban morphology and computer science, spatial information allows us
to see how urban planning, design, and millions of individual decisions shape how cities
organize and order space according to various spatial social logics and cultures. In the 1990s,
Allan Jacobs adapted the style of Nolli maps to manually illustrate figure-ground diagrams of
cities to explore their urban form. Today, OSM provides a worldwide data set to perform
these analytical cartographic workflows automatically and computationally in the Smart
Cities mode of analyzing and understanding cities through user-generated big data.
This paper operationalized OSMnx’s figure-ground diagrams and rose diagrams as
methods of hybrid quantitative-qualitative analysis of urban patterns. These visualizations
reveal the texture, grain, and spatial-ordering logic of different cities around the world.
Compressing the dense spatial complexity inherent in cities, they offer a streamlined and
legible window into the urban fabric and how the circulation system’s infrastructure
percolates through it. These figure-ground diagrams allow us to compare across places at the
same scale to better understand similarities and differences particularly in texture, grain, and
connectivity. The rose diagrams compress the complexity of street network orientation
entropy into simple plots that immediately reveal the spatial ordering of the city’s streets and
its underlying spatial logic.
These visual urban morphology methods and OSMnx workflows can help planners
convey comparative urban form to laypersons. They can destigmatize density and explain
how connectivity and urban texture vary across cities. They simplify complicated urban
planning and urban data science concepts to make them more approachable for practitioners,
community advocates, and other members of the public to engage in citizen science. Future
research can further operationalize these techniques to quantify circulation system
connectivity and griddedness, and measure how street network design has evolved across the
United States. This can provide a comprehensive understanding of a city’s morphological
trajectory through time and, in turn, help planners collaboratively shape that trajectory.

6. Conclusion
This paper explored information management processes of data acquisition, transformation,
modeling, interpretation, and dissemination for understanding and communicating urban
form. It took up Crooks et al.’s (2016) call for developing workflows that meld both datadriven and interpretive approaches to urban morphology in the burgeoning era of usergenerated big data. It discussed the OSMnx toolkit for modeling, analyzing, and visualizing

12

street networks from morphological perspectives, advancing techniques such as Jacobs’s
(1995) figure-ground diagrams and rose diagrams into reproducible, computational
workflows. It situated this theoretical work in the visual culture of planning – adopting a
visually-mediated narrative approach of exploring the urban form and in particular
demonstrating how OSM data can be modeled to explore the spatial ordering that results
from urban planning and design.
In doing so, it made three primary contributions to urban planning/morphology at
the intersection of Smart Cities and information management. First, it presented an urban
data science workflow for collecting, modeling, and interpreting user-contributed big data to
research how cities’ street networks embody different spatial logics and organize complex
human dynamics through urban space. Second, it demonstrated a big data-driven approach to
modeling and evaluating street network orientation and configuration in different places.
Third, it extended these quantitative streams of Smart Cities/information management
scholarship in a complementary qualitative direction by describing how planners can visualize
these complex patterns to make them legible to citizens in collaborative planning processes of
comparing alternative scenarios. This communicative data-driven decision-making sits at the
heart of the intersection of urban planning, morphology, and information management.
Throughout, this paper operationalized a narrative approach, following Kostof’s
(1991) emphasis on social premises and cultural conditions, to interpret urban morphology
qualitatively through data-driven quantitative analysis and visualization. This sets up two key
next steps for future urban morphology research in the Smart Cities paradigm. First, from a
big data perspective, developing richer interactive visual functionality is critical to
empowering analytical reasoning in these planning and engagement processes. Some
interaction was discussed in this paper, but this remains an important emerging frontier at the
intersection of information management and urban planning. Second, future research at the
intersection of information science and urban morphology can further develop the rose
diagrams in the context of information entropy to explore street network orientation-order
and develop new indicators of griddedness to see how planning and design paradigms have
evolved over time in different cities and countries. In tandem, information management and
urban morphology will further converge to provide comprehensive understandings of city
pasts and presents and empower planners and community members in collaborative datadriven decision-making processes.
