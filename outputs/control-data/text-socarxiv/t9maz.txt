Abstract
Research on stratification and mobility has consistently shown that there is a direct impact of
social origin on occupational destination net of educational attainment even for degreeholders. However, only a few studies applied a longitudinal and dynamic perspective on how
intergenerational mobility shapes graduates’ working careers. Using multilevel growth curve
modelling and data from the 1970 British cohort study (BCS70), we contribute to this
research by looking at the emergence of social inequalities during the first ten years since
labour market entry. We further distinguish between graduates of different fields of study as
we expect social disparities to develop differently due to differences in initial occupational
placement and upward mobility processes. We find that parental class does not affect
occupational prestige over and above prior achievement. Separate analyses by the field of
study show that initial differences in occupational prestige and career progression do not
differ between graduates from different classes of origin in STEM fields and arts and
humanities. It is only in the social sciences that working class graduates start with lower
occupational prestige but soon catch up with their peers from higher classes. Overall, our
results indicate no direct effect of social origin on occupational attainment for degree-holders
once we broaden our focus to a dynamic life course perspective.

1. Introduction
Numerous studies in research in social stratification and mobility have found that social origin
and educational attainment are both strong determinants of occupational attainment. The
Blau-Duncan model (1967) already addressed life-cycle variations in occupational attainment,
but scholars have used dynamic approaches of intergenerational inequality in occupational
careers only recently. In such a life course perspective, one asks whether initial differences in
occupational attainment between individuals from different social origin and education groups
perpetuate or increase over the life course or whether career developments offer the potential
to compensate for initial differences (e.g. Mayer 2009; Sørensen 1975). A dynamic
perspective on career advancement and progression is strongly intertwined with current
conceptual advances in theories of cumulative (dis-)advantages (e.g. DiPrete and Eirich
2006).
To account for inter- and intra-generational social mobility a few recent studies have
examined occupational trajectories and career progression of individuals with different social
and educational backgrounds (e.g. Barone, Lucchini and Schizzerotto 2011; Härkönen and
Bihagen 2011; Manzoni, Härkönen and Mayer 2014; Schulz and Maas 2012; Passaretta et al.
2018). Whereas this literature documented differences in career advancement between these
groups and over time, we contribute to previous research by looking at within-group
differences in occupational careers among degree-holders. It allows us to evaluate the impact
of so-called ‘qualitative’ differences that are assumed to be increasingly important as more
and more individuals attain higher education in the course of educational expansion (e.g.
Lucas 2001). A growing literature in education, as well as stratification research, is concerned
with graduates’ field of study as an essential dimension for variation in labour market
outcomes (e.g. Klein 2011; Van de Werfhorst 2002).
Several studies provide empirical evidence for differences between graduates from
different fields of study in various labour market returns such as occupational prestige (Katz3

Gerro and Yaish 2003; Shwed and Shavit 2006), class position (Sullivan et al. 2017) or
earnings (Kim, Tamborini and Sakamoto 2015; Laurison and Friedman 2016; Sullivan et al.
2018). Existing research commonly uses ‘snapshot’ measures at labour market entry or at a
particular age. However, occupational careers of graduates from different fields of study may
evolve differently with some fields offering better chances of occupational upward mobility
than others (cf. Rosenfeld 1992). In consequence, initial social inequalities in labour market
outcomes might decrease over time in some fields, whereas in other fields social inequalities
might even aggravate in the course of individuals’ career progression.
In our article, we, therefore, analyse occupational trajectories by family background
within graduates from different fields of study. The innovative contribution of the paper is
threefold: first, our within-group comparison allows us to analyse the impact of social origin
on career trajectories among the highest qualified that remains unobserved when modelling
social inequalities across the life course and controlling for educational attainment (e.g.
Manzoni, Härkönen and Mayer 2014). Second, this is the first study that considers the
heterogeneous effects of social origin on intragenerational mobility by analysing social
disparities in field-specific careers. Third, by observing a time-span of 10 years since entry
into the labour market, we provide evidence for a potential long-term impact of social origin
in the course of individuals’ working careers. For our empirical analyses, we use data from
the 1970 British Cohort Study and growth curve models to describe within- and betweenindividual occupational trajectories in a holistic way.
2. Previous research: Social origin, field of study and labour market returns
2.1 Family background and graduate’s career progression
Since the seminal book of Blau and Duncan (1967), research in social stratification and
mobility asks whether and to what extent social origin affects the labour market entry and
later stages in the working life. The Blau-Duncan model already emphasised the importance
4

of dynamic modelling and career progression for intergenerational mobility processes.
However, many studies applied cross-sectional analyses to examine the direct effect of social
origin on (graduates’) labour market destination using population samples (e.g. Laurison and
Friedman 2016; Wakeling and Savage 2015), considered outcomes at particular points in time
during the career (Crawford and Vignoles 2014; Macmillan, Tyler and Vignoles 2015; Britton
et al. 2016) or at specific ages (Crawford et al. 2016; Gugushvili, Bukodi and Goldthorpe
2017; Sullivan et al. 2017, 2018).
Jacob et al. (2015) and Bukodi and Goldthorpe (2011) go beyond these single
observations of labour market outcomes, but still, use only two-points-in-time measures of
individual careers. Both studies found initial social disparities in graduates’ labour market
outcomes that decreased across the working life in the UK. Based on REFLEX data, Jacob et
al. (2015) showed that parental education has a positive effect on accessing the higher salariat
class at labour market entry, but this result does not hold five years after graduation. Using
three British cohort studies (1946, 1958, 1970), Bukodi and Goldthorpe (2011) examined
individuals’ occupational earnings. Among degree-holders, they identified social inequalities
in occupational earnings in the first job but a smaller social gradient in the mid-thirties at the
time of “occupational maturity”.
In recent years, social stratification scholars have used new approaches of dynamic
statistical modelling, i.e. multilevel growth curve models, to account for social origin
differences in career advancement (e.g. Barone, Lucchini and Schizzerotto 2011; Härkönen
and Bihagen 2011; Manzoni, Härkönen and Mayer 2014; Schulz and Maas 2012; Passaretta et
al. 2018). However, all of these studies consider the whole working population without
modelling interacting effects between social origin and educational attainment on career
development. Also, previous research did not investigate more fine-grained social gradients
within the same level of education.
2.2 Graduates’ field of study and career progression
5

Field of study is an important determinant of graduates’ labour market outcomes in the UK.
Reimer et al. (2008) show that occupational status varies considerably between graduates
from different fields. In particular, graduates from education and technical fields obtain a
socioeconomic status above average whereas degree-holders in health and welfare and
agricultural fields have the least favourable positions. In contrast, Kim and Kim (2003) found
that graduates from education and humanities and arts are disadvantaged in access to the
upper service class compared to graduates in health or engineering. Regarding financial
returns, Chevalier (2011) shows a substantial heterogeneity in the average wages of UK
graduates from different fields 3.5 years after graduation. Graduates from medicine,
architecture and engineering have the highest wage returns; graduates from linguistics,
communication and arts have the lowest. Bratti, Naylor and Smith (2007) consider wage
returns of UK graduates from different fields at age 30 and show that graduates from the
social sciences have the highest wage returns, graduates from the sciences are in the medium
position, and students from the arts and humanities have the lowest wage returns among all
fields (cf. Walker and Zhu 2011).
Only a few studies so far devoted attention to field-specific career advancement, and if
so, they concentrated on earnings and in most cases were conducted in the US. Thomas and
Zhang (2005) compared the initial wages of graduates to those achieved four years after
graduation. They observed widening initial earnings differences between graduates from
business, math, science, social sciences and graduates from education-related fields and
history. Graduates from health and engineering started their career with high initial earnings
but had a rather small increase across the four years after graduation. Finnie and Frenette
(2003) analysed the earnings growth of Canadian graduates two and five years after
graduation. They showed that (male) graduates from arts and humanities have the highest
increase in average earnings over time, but still, lack behind the earnings of their peers
graduating in other fields. Using data of a panel study combined with administrative tax data,
6

Kim et al. (2015) found that STEM graduates have significant advantages regarding lifetime
earnings gains compared to graduates from the social sciences.
Studies that address variation between fields of study in social gradients in labour
market returns are rare and often limited to wages and income. In a Norwegian study, Hansen
(2001) showed that social inequalities in income are smaller for graduates in STEM fields
than for graduates in humanities and arts. For the Appalachian region in the US, Wolniak et
al. (2008) found that pre-college family income is significantly associated with earnings for
all fields except technical and applied fields. It is the greatest for STEM fields, smallest for
education fields and health sciences with arts and humanities in-between. A recent study in
the US by Manzoni and Streib (2018) showed no differences by parental education in
earnings ten years after graduation for graduates in STEM majors but identified a earnings
advantage for male graduates in arts and humanities with highly educated over their peers
from less educated families. Similarly, Hällsten (2013) found that the effect of the class of
origin on wages in the Swedish labour market is more substantial for graduates from
humanities and arts than for graduates from the sciences. For the UK, Macmillan, Tyler and
Vignoles (2015) considered variation in social gradients in access to higher managerial
positions between different labour market sectors and found a positive association between
parental class and entering a business, medical or law profession 3.5 years after graduation.
None of these studies model variation in social inequalities across fields of study in career
trajectories across the life course.
Summing up, we identify the following gaps in the literature: First, the few given
‘snapshot’ studies of graduates in the UK lacked a profound continuous empirical
measurement of career trajectories by social origin and did not sufficiently answer how social
inequalities develop across careers. Second, many studies were concerned with field-specific
wages and earnings at labour market entry but did not consider field-specific career
progression in occupations that may reveal different patterns. Finally, only a few studies
7

investigated social inequalities in labour market outcomes by field of study and if so, did not
consider career progression over time. However, the average effect of social origin on career
trajectories may be misleading if social inequalities may decrease or increase across the
working life in different fields.
3. Theoretical considerations: social origin and field-specific careers
To explain social gradients in labour market outcomes among individuals with the same
education, previous literature on intergenerational mobility commonly refers to parents’
economic, social and cultural capital that they transmit to their children (Bourdieu 1986;
Coleman 1988). Parents’ economic resources are expected to exert an influence on their
offspring’s labour market outcomes by, for instance, facilitating job search or residential
mobility. Parents’ social networks may be helpful in providing access to information about
vacancies or potential employers. Cultural capital is considered to be beneficial in the
recruitment process (cf. several contributions in Bernardi and Ballarino 2016).
Regarding career development after graduation, we need to distinguish between (1)
initial labour market attainment directly after graduation (differences in intercepts), and (2)
career progression over time (differences in slopes). We assume parental resources and
support to be particularly helpful at labour market entry when employers hire applicants for
the first time and signals of potential productivity are limited. Later in the career, employers
can either observe employees’ productivity directly or evaluate job applicants’ accumulated
work experience. Graduates from the lower class of origin may, therefore, compensate for
initial disadvantages and catch up with their peers from the higher class of origin across the
career. We expect that there are social class differentials at labour market entry. However,
these class differentials vanish across the career due to steeper career progression of those
from the lower class of origin (Hypothesis 1). For the UK, empirical results by Bukodi &

8

Goldthorpe (2011) and Jacob et al. (2015) already provide some support for the assumption of
convergence between graduates’ careers.

-- Figure I here --

To derive hypotheses on field-specific social class differentials in career advancement,
we use a combination of theories on returns to field-specific skills, labour market allocation
and promotion processes, and different labour market segments. First, a standard explanation
for varying returns to fields of study is differences in the type of graduate skills (Heijke,
Meng and Ramaekers 2003; Paglin and Rufolo 1990; Van de Werfhorst and Kraaykamp
2001). For example, Van de Werfhorst and Kraaykamp (2001) distinguish four types of
endowments: cultural, economic, communicative and technical resources. Graduates with
high levels of economic skills (e.g. business and administration, law) as well as those with
technical resources (e.g. technical fields, maths and sciences) achieve more rewarding
occupational positions in the labour market whereas graduating in fields linked to cultural
skills (e.g. arts and humanities, education) yields the lowest labour market returns. However,
these considerations refer to average returns in the labour market and do not imply any
expectations about career progression. Assuming ceiling effects, graduates starting in highstatus positions at labour market entry may have fewer chances for improvement. Second,
Klein (2011) argues that employers have imperfect information about labour market entrants’
productivity and training costs and, therefore, graduates from fields providing ‘soft skills’
have only a weak signalling value due to their low occupational specificity. As tenure and
work experience grows over time, however, graduates from unspecific fields can correct
initial mismatches, move ahead in their careers and gain promotions as employers can judge
them more accurately. Overeducation is less likely to occur among labour market entrants
9

from ‘occupation-specific’ fields, and therefore there is less need for later corrections. Finally,
the third line of theoretical explanations for field of study differences in career progression
focuses on characteristics of graduates’ jobs (e.g. Giesecke and Schindler 2008). This
approach distinguishes between highly regulated labour market sectors with fewer
opportunities (and less necessity) for occupational and career mobility and flexible market
segments with high rates of temporary employment. Strong linkages between fields of study
and occupational labour markets may, therefore, be advantageous for entry into high-status
occupations and long-term occupational stability. Summing up, we can expect appropriate
high-status positions at labour market entry for graduates from occupation-specific fields,
such as STEM fields, and less intragenerational mobility over time compared to graduates in
social sciences, arts and humanities.
Taking into account social origin, we assume parental resources to compensate for
signalling of unspecific skills. Hence, for graduates from the arts and humanities, we expect
vast social inequalities in initial labour market allocation. However, it is not clear whether and
how social gradients develop across the career. On the one hand, students from lower classes
of origin may overcome their initial disadvantages and catch up with those from higher class
of origin as their real productivity becomes visible throughout their career. (Hypothesis 2a).
On the other hand, if career advancement and promotion in the labour market of arts and
humanities requires social and cultural resources, the advantages of offspring from higher
classes may persist or become more significant due to cumulative advantages (Hypothesis
2b).
Graduates from STEM fields have acquired more specific skills and qualifications
compared to graduates from other fields. Thus, in the matching occupational labour market,
parents from STEM graduates should have less leeway on job allocation procedures than in
other partial labour markets. Also, we assume that STEM graduates enter occupations with
relatively high task specificity and thus productivity is more dependent on what was taught
10

during graduates’ studies than on pre-existing skills or resources learned in the parental home.
Therefore, we expect social inequalities among STEM graduates to be small both in initial
placement and career progression (Hypothesis 3).
In the social sciences (incl. business and administration, economics), we expect
degree-holders to enter medium-status occupational positions at labour market entry.
Regarding career progression, we anticipate increasing social inequalities over time as social
and cultural capital acquired in the parental home may facilitate access to and promotion in
services and higher managerial positions (Jackson, Goldthorpe and Mills 2005). Also, for
these graduates, intergenerational inheritance of business and self-employment may also play
a crucial role for career progression. Hence, we expect a divergence of occupational positions
over time due to a steeper slope for those from higher classes (Hypothesis 4). Figure II
illustrates these field-specific hypotheses.
--- Figure II here --4. Data, variables and methods
4.1 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)
For our empirical analysis, we use the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) which
follows the lives of people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970
(Elliott and Shepherd 2006). The original sample consisted of over 17,000 individuals. At the
ages of five, 10 and 16 cohort members were followed-up by parental interview and
examination. At the age of 26, cohort members filled in a postal questionnaire and were then
interviewed at four-year intervals from the age 30 onwards. In our paper, we use information
collected in the third sweep (age 10, Butler and Bynner 2016) and sweeps six to eight (age 3038, University of London 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). We additionally draw on the 1970 British
Cohort Study Activity Histories dataset (University of London 2016d) including retrospective
information on activity histories from the age of 16 until the interview date of sweep 8, i.e.
11

until age 38 (Hancock et al. 2011). We use retrospective information on the field of study,
type of degree, marital status and number of children from sweeps 6 to 8 (age 30-38), and
identified individual background information on the parental class, cognitive ability and
ethnicity in the third sweep (age 10).
As with other longitudinal studies, the BCS70 is subject to considerable unit nonresponse across all waves. Only around 20 per cent of cohort members participated in all
existing waves, over half of the cohort members dropped out of at least one wave but returned
to the study and one third dropped from the study entirely (Mostafa and Wiggins 2015). Unit
non-response is not random, mainly due to residential moves (Elliott and Shepherd 2006), but
the predictive power of birth characteristics for unit non-response is consistently weak across
waves and, therefore, undermines the efficacy of using non-response weights (Mostafa and
Wiggins 2015; Cumming and Goldstein 2016). There are changes in the parental class
composition across waves, but the proportion of fathers with manual occupations was mainly
falling between wave 1 and wave 3 and did not considerably change afterwards (Mostafa and
Wiggins 2015).
Our analytical sample consists of university graduates (undergraduate and
postgraduate) who studied full-time and graduated from a UK HE institution until the age of
34. We observe graduates’ career progression from their first significant job (lasting at least 6
months) until up to 10 years in the labour market. We exclude part-time students from our
sample since their educational attainment runs in parallel to their occupational career and they
are likely to have a more stable starting point after graduation when compared to full-time
graduates. Overall, we identified 1347 graduates at age 34 who were full-time students, for
whom information on the timing of graduation was available and who had at least one
significant job during the observation period.
4.2 Variables and operationalisation

12

Table I provides an overview of the variables and descriptive statistics for 951
complete cases across 99,399 person-months. Our dependent variable is the Treiman
occupational prestige scale (SIOPS) measured at each job across the observation period
(Treiman 1977). This internationally standardised scale of occupational prestige shows
remarkable stability across time and countries and is widely used in life course analysis of
occupational attainment (Härkönen and Bihagen 2011; Härkönen, Manzoni and Bihagen
2016; Manzoni, Härkönen and Mayer 2014). To assign SIOPS scores to occupations, we
recoded British SOC90 occupational codes into ISCO-88 codes. In our sample of graduates,
SIOPS scores range between 15 (e.g. building construction labourers) and 78 (e.g. university
professors and medical doctors), with an average of 54.79 and a standard deviation of 11.26.
--- Table I here --We measure months since labour market entry as the time since graduates started their
first significant job, lasting at least six months. Since we intend to capture inequalities among
graduates in career progression across the life course, we consider the time since individuals
entered the labour market rather than their actual work experience. We follow graduates for
up to ten years since their labour market entry, i.e. the measure is right-censored at 120
months. The average time that we observe graduates since labour market entry is around six
years (SD=34.52 months). To avoid the predefinition of a functional form and to allow for
variation in career progression across different stages, we model career progression as five
24-month splines and estimate linear slopes for each range.
Our measure of months since labour market entry does not account for career
circumstances, career breaks and re-entry into the labour market due to family formation.
Therefore, we control for part-time employment, the number of children and marital status.
All these control variables are time-varying measures to account for changes in family
circumstances across the occupational career.

13

We operationalise our main independent variable, class of origin, with the 7-class
‘analytical’ version of the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC), an
improved operationalisation of the EGP class schema (Goldthorpe 2007). To construct NSSEC codes, we rely on data on parents’ occupation provided by Gregg (2012). We use the
highest class position of both parents and aggregate this measure into three classes
differentiating between salariat class (1. higher and 2. lower managerial and professional
occupations), intermediate class (3. intermediate occupations, 4. small employers and own
account workers, 5. lower supervisory and technical occupations) and working class (6. semiroutine and 7. routine occupations).
To operationalise field of study, we follow Bratti et al. (2007) and Walker and Zhu
(2011) differentiating between three broad groups: 1) humanities (incl. arts.) 2) social
sciences, 3) and fields in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) (for
details on aggregation see Appendix Table AI). We additionally consider law and medicine as
a fourth category as their professional career pathways are unique and, therefore, we refrain
from mixing them with other fields. Field of study is operationalised as time-varying since
individuals may change their field of study from undergraduate to postgraduate studies or
may study for a second degree in a different field. The type of degree differentiates between
first degree and postgraduate degree. Likewise, we measure this in a time-varying way so that
it captures changes in educational attainment.
We also control for background characteristics such as gender and ethnic origin. Due
to the small sample size, we only differentiate between individuals originating from the UK
and individuals originating from a different country.
Following Breen and Goldthorpe (2001), we operationalize cognitive ability by
totalling all four conducted British Ability Scales (BAS) assessments (Elliott, Murray and
Pearson 1979) – two verbal subscales (word definitions and word similarities) and two non-

14

verbal subscales (recall of digits and matrices) - and standardised it to a mean of 100 and a
standard deviation of 15.
4.3 Analytic strategy
To analyse the association between graduates’ social origin and occupational attainment over
the early working life, we use growth curve modelling (Halaby 2003; Steele 2008). Growth
curve modelling allows for the inclusion of time-constant and time-varying variables while
putting particular emphasis on the modelling of time, in our case, career progression over the
early life course and its association with covariates (i.e. differences in career progression by
covariates).
Our baseline growth curve model is as follows:
5

yit   0   1sTimeits   2Classi   3 Ethnici   4Cog i  5 Fieldit   6 Degreeit   7 Marstatit
s 1

 8Child it   9 Partit  i   it

The model includes the five 24-months splines, dummy variables for class of origin, ethnic
origin, fields of study, type of degree, marital status, part-time employment and linear
specifications for cognitive ability and the number of children. It also contains a personspecific unobserved factor  (random effect) and a time-varying error term  . The intraclass
correlation - which we calculate based on the variances of the error terms

(    2 / ( 2   2 )) - shows us how much of the overall variance in occupational prestige is
due to variation between individuals and due to variation within individuals across the early
and mid-career. The stronger this intraclass correlation, the more inequality between
graduates in occupational prestige exists and the fewer within-changes we can identify across
graduate careers.
The 1s estimates indicate the average monthly change in occupational attainment
within the 24-month splines. The remaining  coefficients indicate the strength of
15

associations between the respective variables and occupational prestige averaged across the
early working career. To test our first hypothesis, we extend our baseline model by including
interaction terms between graduates’ class of origin and our five splines for time since labour
market entry. To test the hypotheses on field-specific social inequalities, we run our extended
model including the interaction between graduates’ class of origin and spline for the three
different field groups separately.
5. Results
5.1 Occupational prestige across the early career
Table II indicates a series of growth curve models. To decompose the total variance
into variance between individuals and within-variance across the career, our first model (M0)
is an empty model without any covariates. Model M1 introduces five 24-months splines to
show how occupational prestige changes over the first ten years after labour market entry.
Model M2 accounts for the class of origin, ethnicity and gender (also includes the family
variables and an indicator of part-time employment). Model M3 investigate whether social
inequalities in occupational prestige are due to differences in cognitive ability. To account for
differences in graduate characteristics that may explain a class of origin gap in occupational
prestige, we include the field of study and type of degree in the last model (M4).
The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICT) as shown in M0 indicates to what extent
the total variation in occupational prestige is due to differences between graduates rather than
within-differences across the career. In our sample, the ICT shows that 71 per cent of the
overall variance is due to differences in occupational prestige between graduates. Thus,
differences in occupational prestige between graduates rather emerge at the beginning of the
career, and there is only modest career mobility over time that corrects for these initial
differences. Compared to working populations in Germany (Manzoni, Härkönen and Mayer
2014) or Italy (Barone, Lucchini and Schizzerotto 2011), however, the ICT is smaller, i.e.
16

career mobility (among graduates) is higher than in these settings. It may indicate that the UK
labour market is more dynamic than labour markets in other countries or that graduate labour
markets offer more leeway for career progression or both.
Model 1 in Table II introduces the five 24-month splines. Graduates’ make progress in
their career predominantly in the first two years after they gained their first significant job:
The average graduate gains 3.02 (24 x 0.126) SIOPS points across the first 24 months. In the
following two years, career progression slows down but graduates, on average, still achieve
considerable gains (1.032 SIOPS points, 24 x 0.043). After four years since the first
significant job, graduates appear to be more established in their careers and change in
occupational prestige is limited but not entirely stopped. Graduates, on average, gain 1.56
SIOPS points (24 x 0.027 + 24 x 0.017 + 24 x 0.021) across the following six years. Overall,
graduates gain, on average, 5.6 SIOPS points across the first ten years since labour market
entry.
Model 2 includes the background characteristics of class of origin, ethnic origin and
gender. While all estimates are in the expected direction, effect sizes are rather small.
Graduates from an intermediate class background gain, on average, 0.521 SIOPS points and
working-class background gain, on average, 1.829 SIOPS points less than graduates whose
parents belong to the salariat class. Hence, among UK graduates, prestige differences by class
of origin across the occupational career are rather small. Accounting for cognitive ability
(M3), these class of origin differences further reduce but do not entirely vanish when
differentiating between graduates from working class and salariat class background. The last
model (M4) additionally accounts for the field of study and type of degree. Differences
between graduates from fields of study regarding occupational prestige are small and do not
show a clear pattern. Graduates who achieve a postgraduate degree have a substantial
advantage in occupational prestige compared to degree-holders. Accounting for these
graduate characteristics reduces the contrast between graduates from working class and
17

salariat class background in occupational prestige marginally. Averaged across graduate
careers, the direct effect of class of origin on occupational prestige net of cognitive ability and
horizontal educational differences appears to be negligible.
5.2 Occupational career progression by social origin and field of study
So far, the effects of career progression analysed in Table II refer to average careers.
We now turn to the results on career progression by class of origin as expressed in hypothesis
1. Figure III shows the predicted SIOPS scores by class of origin and time since labour
market entry while holding the other variables at their reference value (see full estimates in
appendix table AII). In this figure, we can see small differences in occupational prestige
between graduates from working-class background and graduates from both intermediate and
salariat class background at labour market entry. This difference becomes slightly stronger
across the first two years as graduates from salariat and intermediate class backgrounds have
steeper growth curves than graduates from working-class background. In the following two
years, occupational prestige continues to grow to the same extent as previously for workingclass graduates, while growth slows down for graduates with higher-class backgrounds.
Hence, graduates from working-class backgrounds catch up with their peers from more
advantaged backgrounds after four years in the labour market.
To test our field-specific hypothesis, we predict SIOPS scores by class of origin and
time since labour market entry for the different field of study groups separately (see full
estimates in appendix table AIII), results are shown in Figure IV. Unfortunately, we cannot
consider social inequalities in career progression within law and medicine as the number of
cases is too small to conduct such an analysis. In humanities, class of origin differences are
minimal. If at all, working-class graduates tend to be disadvantaged in their career
progression in the first two years after gaining a first significant job but they catch up with
their peers from more advantaged backgrounds afterwards. Likewise, we do not find
18

substantial social inequalities in career progression for graduates from STEM fields.
Working-class graduates achieve slightly higher scores of occupational prestige at all stages
of their career. In contrast, working-class graduates in the social sciences have, on average, a
prestige score at labour market entry that is about five SIOPS points lower than the score of
graduates from more advantaged backgrounds. Graduates from working-class backgrounds
can overcome this initial disadvantage and catch up with their peers from higher-class
backgrounds eight years after graduation.
6. Discussion
We examined early occupational careers of degree-holders in the UK and the long-term
influence of social origin up to 10 years after labour market entry. Differentiating between
graduates of different fields allowed us to describe the evolution of social inequalities on top
of the educational level. Given the increasing share of degree-holders in the UK (and
elsewhere) qualitative differences such as field of study may have become increasingly
crucial for processes of social stratification. By adopting a dynamic approach looking at
intergenerational occupational mobility, we wanted to detect whether and to what extent
social inequalities in the early career are strengthened or mitigated, and whether initial
disparities and differences in career progression vary by field of study.
Averaged across the whole observation period of 10 years after labour market entry,
we did not find significantly lower occupational attainment for graduates from working-class
backgrounds compared to graduates from higher classes of origin. When we looked more
closely at the effect of social origin at different stages of the career, our illustration of career
patterns showed lower occupational attainment of working-class offspring at labour market
entry. However, due to a steeper career progression, they catch up with the careers of their
peers from higher classes of origin four years after labour market entry. This result provides

19

evidence for our first hypothesis and is in line with previous research (Jacob, Klein and
Iannelli 2015; Bukodi and Goldthorpe 2011)
Regarding the development of occupational prestige in different fields of study,
progression and social origin differences of career growth vary by field of study. In line with
our expectations, we found social inequalities in occupational prestige neither at labour
market entry nor in career progression in STEM fields. Contrary to our assumptions, there
were also no social gradients in occupational careers for graduates in arts and humanities. We
observed more pronounced inequalities among graduates in the social sciences but in the
opposite way that we expected. Working-class graduates attain significantly lower
occupational prestige at labour market entry compared to other graduates. However, they
catch up with their peers and achieve the same level of occupational prestige a few years after
labour market entry.
Our results contribute to research on social inequalities in graduates’ labour market
outcomes. In line with previous results on UK graduates using the same dataset (e.g. most
recently Sullivan et al. 2017, 2018) we did not find a substantial direct effect of social origin
on graduates’ average occupational attainment over the period of ten years after labour market
entry. However, we found different patterns of career progression that we would not have
been able to detect in ‘snapshot’ analyses. Graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds have
lower occupational attainment only at labour market entry and due to a steeper progression
achieve about the same level of occupational prestige than their peers rather early in their
career. Ad hoc explanations could be that the graduate labour market is rather formalised and
bureaucratic or that those working class children that achieve a degree are a selective group of
students with productivity-enhancing characteristics. Our results also support the thesis that a
degree is an “equaliser” for labour market outcomes as social origin has no effect on
occupational prestige over and above attaining a degree in the long run (Torche 2011). The
‘null’ result of no social gradients in the labour market is not common in social stratification
20

research where scholars more frequently stress and empirically find cumulative (dis)advantages.
Our results also highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in social
inequalities in the labour market within broader educational groups. We only found social
class differences in occupational prestige at labour market entry among graduates from the
social sciences but only marginal differences among graduates from the humanities and
STEM fields. This variation in the social gradient in occupational prestige is hidden if we just
look at the average association between social origin and graduate careers. We cannot
empirically test however why this is the case. What we can exclude is the possibility that
graduates from higher classes of origin have social or ‘soft’ skills that are advantageous in
gaining access to higher managerial occupations as these skills should be valuable and give
them an advantage over graduates from working-class origin throughout the career. It could
be that parental social capital is essential to gain access to prestigious entry positions for
social science graduates. It could also be that graduates from the social sciences have a high
risk of being overeducated at labour market entry and parental resources protect graduates
from advantaged backgrounds from having to accept a vertically mismatched position.
However, these potential mechanisms could also be valid for the humanities for which we did
not find these social inequalities.
Our study has several limitations: First, our study is merely descriptive in analysing
the career trajectories of graduates from different social backgrounds. A causal interpretation
of our estimates rests on the strong assumption that there are no important unmeasured factors
that influence degree attainment in different fields of study, occupational attainment and its
progression, and at the same time vary by social origin. Graduates from lower class
backgrounds may be a selective group regarding characteristics such as motivation,
aspirations, preferences, extracurricular and other activities that, in turn, affect labour market
21

entry and career progression. Compared to previous studies that focus on graduates, our study
is, however, unique in accounting for cognitive ability differences between graduates from
different backgrounds and as such may address a considerable part of the selectivity in our
graduate sample.
Our second limitation is the small sample size and weak statistical power especially
when we focus on social inequalities in career progression within fields of study. Compared
to graduate surveys, our data provide the advantage of looking at graduates’ long-term career
mobility in a more dynamic perspective. Nevertheless, in future research, these results need to
be replicated with larger samples.
Third, our paper solely focused on the outcome of occupational prestige. Extending
our analysis with income appears to be promising as income has a stronger variation than
occupational prestige and is less prone to ceiling effects. Hence, inter- and intra-generational
mobility patterns may be different from what we observe in our analysis when using income
(Sullivan et al. 2018; Witteveen and Attewell 2017 for the US).
Finally, we did not assess career progression beyond ten years after labour market
entry. We cannot exclude the possibility that social inequalities emerge again in the later
stages of the life course. Also, social disparities may go beyond occupational stratification,
i.e. regarding allocation into different labour market sectors, different employment statuses,
and different geographic locations as has been examined by Manzoni and Streib (2018) in the
US context.
Given the insights gained by applying a dynamic perspective on the career progression
of graduates, we suggest that longitudinal approaches on intergenerational mobility need to be
further developed, both theoretically and empirically, to gain a better understanding of
underlying mechanisms on when and how social inequalities emerge, increase or even decline
over the life-course.
