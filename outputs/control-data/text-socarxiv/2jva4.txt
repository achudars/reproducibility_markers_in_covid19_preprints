Work Demands and Resources and the
Work–Family Interface. Testing a Salience Model
on German Service Sector Employees∗

Abstract
The present study tested an extended version of Voydanoff’s (2004)
‘differential salience vs. comparable salience’ model in a sample of German
service workers. Our findings partially support the model in a different
national/cultural context but also yielded some divergent findings with
respect to within-domain resources and boundary-spanning demands. In
line with the theoretical framework, work-to-home interference (WHI)
mainly occurred because of high work demands and not because of a
lack of work resources. Boundary-spanning resources yielded comparable
potential to reduce WHI and enhance work-to-home enrichment (WHE).
WHE was expected to more likely occur due to the activation of work
resources rather than the absence of work demands. However, control
over one’s work did not have a significant impact on WHE. In addition
and contrary to the theoretical model, boundary-spanning demands were
found to be differentially rather than comparably salient to the work–
family interface.

Introduction
Women’s increasing labor force participation, globalization, downsizing, and
flexible work patterns have led to feelings of increasing work pressure, stress,
and conflict between work and private life among employees (Green, 2006). Consequently, studies of the work–family interface have long been dominated by a
conflict perspective, and a vast body of research has examined the causes and

Research for this study was partly supported by the European Commission through funding
of the cross-national collaborative research project ‘Quality of Life in a Changing Europe’
(Bäck-Wiklund et al., 2011), within which the data were collected.

consequences of conflict between the work and family domains (see Eby et al.,
2005, for an overview). However, the processes through which characteristics
associated with the work and family domains influence each other, are not necessarily uni-directional and uni-dimensional. Recently, the research focus has
shifted to include a more positive view of the work–family interface by investigating the beneficial aspects of multiple role engagement such as work–family
enrichment or facilitation (e.g. Barnett and Hyde, 2001; Beham et al., 2010;
Drobnič et al., 2010; Greenhaus and Powell, 2006; Grzywacz and Butler, 2005;
Voydanoff, 2005a).
Studying both perspectives provides a richer picture of the work–family interface. In this line of research, negative and positive work-to-home interference
consists of cognitive appraisals of the effects of the work domain on the family
domain, and vice versa. The perception of work–family conflict or enrichment
derives from assessing the extent to which demands hinder, or resources enhance, the performance of work and family roles. However, the patterns of association between resources and demands on the one hand, and enrichment and
conflict on the other are complex and not immediately evident. For example,
can high resources in the work domain compensate for job demands to prevent
conflict at the work–family interface? Voydanoff (2004) provides a comprehensive model in which within-domain work demands and resources are expected
to have differential salience for work–family conflict and facilitation, whereas
boundary-spanning resources are expected to show comparable relationships to
conflict and facilitation. We build upon Voydanoff’s (2004) ‘differential salience
vs. comparable salience’ model to examine an integrated model of work demands
and resources and the work–family interface.
Our study extends the existing literature in several ways. First, Voydanoff’s
(2004) model has only been tested using a sample of employees in the United
States. By analyzing German service sector employees, this study contributes to
the increasing body of international work–family research. Testing theoretical
models in different national/cultural settings is an important precondition for
drawing firm conclusions. Although Voydanoff (2004) in principle found support
for her model, empirical findings yielded some deviations from her theoretical
model (e.g. time pressure, a within-domain work demand, also decreased workto-family facilitation; meaningful work, a within-domain work resource, also
reduced work-to-family conflict). Hence, additional empirical tests are needed
to further assess the usefulness of the model. Second, we extend the original
‘differential salience vs. comparable salience’ model (Voydanoff, 2004) of withindomain demands and resources and boundary-spanning resources by also including demands that span across the domains. Boundary-spanning demands have
been suggested by Voydanoff in a later article (Voydanoff, 2005a). Similar to
boundary-spanning resources, boundary-spanning demands are expected to be

2

comparably salient to negative and positive work-to-home interference. However, this has not been empirically tested in an integrated research model yet.
Third, we provide initial empirical evidence for antecedents of positive work-tohome interference in a German context. Whereas the conflict perspective and
its negative impact on employee well-being have received considerable empirical
confirmation in German samples (e.g. Jacobshagen et al., 2005; Wiese, 2004),
the positive view of the work–family interface has been neglected thus far in
work–family research in Germany.
To begin with, a brief overview of the theoretical background of the involved constructs is provided. Based on the ‘differential salience vs. comparable
salience’ model (Voydanoff, 2004), a set of hypotheses is developed and tested.
Finally, the results, implications, limitations of the study, and future research
suggestions are discussed.

Theoretical framework
The work–family interface
Two competing theoretical perspectives have been applied in empirical studies
on the work–family interface to explain the outcomes associated with engaging
in multiple roles in life. These are the scarcity argument (Goode, 1960) and the
enhancement argument (Marks, 1977; Sieber, 1974) of role theory. According
to the scarcity argument (Goode, 1960), a person has a limited amount of resources and energy. Engaging in multiple life roles such as work and private life
means competition for these limited resources, thereby leading to the experience
of work–family conflict (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). Whereas early studies
conceptualized work–family conflict as a uni-dimensional construct (e.g. Kopelman et al., 1983), later research distinguished two directions of interference,
namely work interfering with family/home (WHI) and family/home interfering
with work (HWI) (Beham et al., 2014; Frone et al., 1992, 1997), and three dimensions of interference, namely time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based WHI
and HWI (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). The two different directions of work–
home interference received considerable attention in empirical studies and were
found to have different antecedents (see Byron, 2005, for an overview). However, only few studies assessed work–home interference as a multi-dimensional
construct (Eby et al., 2005). Those studies investigating the three dimensions
of WHI separately only found little differences in the relationships with workrelated antecedents (e.g. Chen et al., 2009; Fu and Shaffer, 2001; Lapierre and
Allen, 2006; Spector et al., 2007).
The enhancement argument, based on the work of sociological theorists in
the 1970’s (Marks, 1977; Sieber, 1974), suggests that engagement in multiple
life roles can generate social and economic resources (e.g. social support, added
3

income, opportunities to experience success), and thus can be beneficial for individuals (Barnett and Hyde, 2001). In a study spanning thirty years, Moen et al.
(1992) showed that multiple-role involvement had a long-term positive effect on
the health and social integration of women. In spite of compelling evidence that
multiple roles can be beneficial, research on the work–family interface has been
heavily dominated by a conflict perspective based on the scarcity argument of
role theory (Goode, 1960). Only recently have work–family scholars developed a
variety of constructs which capture the positive side of the work–family interface,
such as positive spillover (Hanson et al., 2006), facilitation (Van Steenbergen
et al., 2007), and enrichment (Greenhaus and Powell, 2006).
In the present study we focus on work–home enrichment, which is defined
as ‘the extent to which experiences in one role improve the quality of life in
the other role’ (Greenhaus and Powell, 2006, p. 73). Similar to work–family
conflict, work–home enrichment is a bi-directional and multi-dimensional construct: work experiences can improve the quality of family/private life (workto-home enrichment; WHE), and family/private experiences can improve the
quality of work (home-to-work enrichment; HWE). WHE consists of three dimensions: developmental, affective, and capital enrichment, whereas HWE is
comprised of slightly different dimensions, namely developmental, affective, and
efficiency-based enrichment (Carlson et al., 2006). Greenhaus and Powell (2006)
distinguish two paths through which the performance of the other role can be
improved: resources such as skills, material resources or social capital improve
the performance in the other role either directly (instrumental path), or indirectly through the creation of positive affect within one domain which in turn
improves the quality of life in the other domain (affective path).
Empirical evidence on antecedents and outcomes of work-to-family enrichment has only recently emerged and few studies have been conducted in a nonUS study context (e.g. Baral and Bhargava, 2010; Bhargava and Baral, 2009;
Siu et al., 2010a). Work-identity, job salience, supervisor support, developmental experiences at work, team resources, and job characteristics such as job
autonomy, skill variety and task identity, were found to be positively related
to WHE (e.g. Baral and Bhargava, 2010; Bhargava and Baral, 2009; Hunter
et al., 2010; Siu et al., 2010a). With respect to outcomes, WHE was linked
to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, job and life
satisfaction, project satisfaction, relationship quality, and health (e.g. Baral and
Bhargava, 2010; Bhargava and Baral, 2009; Gareis et al., 2009; Wayne et al.,
2006). Research on the relationships between work-related antecedents and the
three dimensions of WHE is confined to the bivariate results reported by Carlson
et al. (2006).

Differential salience vs. comparable salience model
Building on the dual-process model of work–home interference (Bakker and
Geurts, 2004), Voydanoff (2004) suggested an integrative framework of demands
and resources, which combines both arguments of role theory. The ‘differential salience vs. comparable salience’ model proposes that within-domain work
demands and resources are differentially salient to negative and positive work–
family interference whereas boundary-spanning resources are comparably salient
to negative and positive work–family interference. We extend this model by
including boundary-spanning demands which Voydanoff introduced in a later
study (Voydanoff, 2005a), and thus were not part of the original salience model.
Similar to boundary-spanning resources, boundary-spanning demands are expected to be comparably salient to both WHI and WHE, but relationships are
expected to be in the opposite direction.
Within-domain work demands refer to ‘physical, social, or organizational
aspects of a job that require sustained physical or mental effort, and are therefore
associated with certain physiological and psychological costs’ (Demerouti et al.,
2001, p. 501). According to the scarcity argument (Goode, 1960), within-domain
work demands limit the ability of employees to successfully manage their nonwork domain responsibilities and are thus salient to negative work-to-family
interference. Voydanoff (2005a) distinguishes between time-based and strainbased work demands. Time-based demands such as long working hours and
overtime may reduce individuals’ time available for family life, and thus make it
difficult for them to fulfill their family obligations. Strain-based work demands
constrain an individual’s ability or willingness to meet the obligations of the
family role and can lead to the experience of stress and strain (Frone et al.,
1997). Both types of work demands have consistently been found to be related
to work–family conflict (e.g Beham and Drobnič, 2011; Frone et al., 1997; Major
et al., 2002; Voydanoff, 2004, 2005b).
Within-domain work resources refer to aspects of one’s job that are either
functional in achieving work goals, reduce costs associated with job demands,
or stimulate personal growth and development. Job resources can either be intrinsic to the task (e.g. job variety, job autonomy, feedback) or located in the
context of the workplace (e.g. learning and career opportunities, social support
at work) (Demerouti et al., 2001). According to the enhancement argument of
multiple life roles (Sieber, 1974), participation in the work role can generate a
number of domain resources such as skills, abilities, certain behaviors and social
support, that enable employees to function better in the family domain. In addition, psychological benefits and rewards generated at work such as motivation,
a sense of accomplishment, and self esteem may spill over from work into family
and increase positive work-to-family interference (Voydanoff, 2004). Empirical
studies have revealed positive relationships between work resources such as job

5

autonomy, job variety and complexity, learning opportunities, meaningful work
and respect, and work-to-family facilitation (Butler et al., 2005; Grzywacz and
Butler, 2005; Voydanoff, 2004).
Whereas within-domain work demands and resources are characteristics of
the work environment which deplete or enhance the ability of employees to meet
the obligations of the family domain, boundary-spanning demands and resources
directly address the connection between work and family/home. An unsupportive work–family culture or bringing work home are examples of boundaryspanning demands. Support from supervisor and colleagues and flexible working
arrangements are examples of boundary-spanning resources (Voydanoff, 2005a).
According to the theoretical model, boundary-spanning resources have the potential to both decrease negative work-to-family interference and enhance positive work-to-family interference through processes that increase the ability of
employees to manage work–family boundaries (Voydanoff, 2004).
Boundary-spanning demands, on the other hand, may limit employees’ transitions between work and family domains and increase role blurring between
domains, thereby hampering employees in effectively functioning in the work
and family domains (Voydanoff, 2005a). Empirical studies revealed negative
relationships between aspects of a supportive work–family culture such as a
supportive supervisor and colleagues with work-to-family conflict, and positive
relationships with work-to-family facilitation and enrichment (e.g. Siu et al.,
2010a; Thompson et al., 1999; Voydanoff, 2004). Aspects of an unsupportive
work–family culture, such as organizational time demands and career consequences, were found to be positively associated with work-to-family conflict
(e.g. Beham and Drobnič, 2011; Thompson et al., 1999). The use of work–family
policies has been linked to increased levels of work-to-family facilitation, and to
decreased levels of work–family conflict (e.g. Anderson et al., 2002; Thompson
et al., 1999; Voydanoff, 2004).
Based on Voydanoff’s (2004) integrative framework, we developed a set of
hypotheses for a variety of within-domain demands and resources, boundaryspanning demands and resources and both work-to-home interference and workto-home enrichment. Figure 1 gives an overview of the study variables and the
hypothesized relationships.
In line with Voydanoff (2004, 2005a), we propose that WHE is more likely
to occur due to the activation of work resources rather than the absence of
work demands. Likewise, we expect employees to experience WHI mainly because of high demands in their work environment and not because of a lack of
work resources. Boundary-spanning resources are expected to reduce the level
of WHI and enhance WHE experienced by the employee, whereas boundaryspanning demands are expected to increase WHI and decrease WHE. Several
study hypotheses are developed in more detail in the following section.

Hypotheses
Work demands
The negative impact of long working hours and overtime on employee’s abilities
to effectively manage the work–family interface has been a prominent theme in
work–family research. According to the rational model of work–family conflict,
the level of negative work-to-home interference perceived by an individual rises
in proportion to the number of hours spent at work (Greenhaus et al., 1987).
This argument is supported by a number of empirical studies which revealed
a positive relationship between working hours and work interfering with home
(e.g. Byron, 2005; Jacobshagen et al., 2005; Kossek et al., 2006; Major et al.,
2002; Voydanoff, 2004, 2005b). In addition, being required to work overtime on
short notice clearly limits employees’ abilities to meet non-work responsibilities,
and increases negative interference from work into private life (Voydanoff, 2004).
Accordingly, it is hypothesized:
Hypothesis 1. Working hours will be positively related to WHI.
Hypothesis 2. Overtime on short notice will be positively related to
WHI.
Psychological job demands refer to stressors that are directly related to the
job task and workload accomplishment (Karasek, 1979; Karasek et al., 1998).
A heavy workload and conflicting job demands, for example, may create strain
which spills over into private life and increases the experience of WHI (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). Several empirical studies have revealed positive relationships between psychological job demands and work–family conflict (e.g.
Bakker and Geurts, 2004; Jacobshagen et al., 2005; Spector et al., 2007; Voydanoff, 2004, 2005b). In line with these findings, it is hypothesized:
Hypothesis 3. Psychological job demands will be positively related
to WHI.
Global competition and restructuring have increased employee’s feelings of
job insecurity, and its detrimental effects on employees’ attitudes and wellbeing
are well documented in the literature (see Sverke and Hellgren, 2002, for an
overview). The present study focuses on perceived job insecurity (rather than
on actual job loss) which refers to an individual’s fear or worry about the job
future (Sverke and Hellgren, 2002). Concern over losing one’s job presents a
threat to the economic well-being required for the stability and quality of one’s
family life (Voydanoff, 2005b). Perceived job insecurity has been found to be
related to higher levels of work-to-family conflict in employees (e.g. Batt and
Valcour, 2003; Jacobshagen et al., 2005; Voydanoff, 2004, 2005b). Accordingly,
it is hypothesized:
8

Hypothesis 4. Perceived job insecurity will be positively related to
WHI.

Work resources
Work resources can either be associated with the job itself or with the broader
work environment (Demerouti et al., 2001). In this study, we specifically focus
on two types of work resources intrinsic to the job, namely job control and
skill/job variety. Job control refers to the degree to which an employee perceives
that he/she can control when, where and how to do his/her job (Kossek et al.,
2006). Having greater control over one’s work increases the ability of employees
to better manage their work and non-work demands, and may thus improve
the quality of their private lives (Beham et al., 2012; Drobnič et al., 2010; Präg
et al., 2010). Job or skill variety refers to the level of skills and creativity a job
requires and to the employee’s flexibility to decide which skills to employ at work
(Karasek et al., 1998). A job that requires creativity and a variety of skills may
not only create the experience of meaningfulness in one’s work (Hackman and
Oldham, 1976), but may also enable employees to increase their performance
in both the work and the family domains (Voydanoff, 2005b). Research has
revealed positive relationships between job control, job variety and work-tofamily facilitation (Butler et al., 2005; Grzywacz and Butler, 2005; Voydanoff,
2004). Accordingly, it is hypothesized:
Hypothesis 5. Job control will be positively related to WHE.
Hypothesis 6. Job variety will be positively related to WHE.

Boundary-spanning demands and resources
A supportive work–family culture and work–family policies are important components of a family-friendly work environment (Allen, 2001). Work–family culture refers to the underlying values, beliefs, and shared assumptions regarding
the priority of work over family (and vice versa) in organizations (Thompson
et al., 1999). Voydanoff (2004) argues that a family-supportive organizational
culture legitimizes employees’ non-work needs in the workplace and their efforts
to meet private responsibilities. A supportive work–family culture may thus
reduce employees’ strain and discomfort associated with work-to-family conflict
and increase positive spillover between work and the non-work domain.
Work–family culture is defined as a multi-dimensional construct in work–
family literature, with organizational time expectations, negative career consequences, supervisor and coworker support comprising the major dimensions of
work–family culture (Dikkers et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 1999). Empirical

9

studies, yielding different relationships between various dimensions of work–
family culture and work-to-home interference, provide support for its multidimensional character. Whereas organizational time demands were found to
be related to higher levels of WHI (e.g. Beham and Drobnič, 2011; Thompson
et al., 1999), supervisor and coworker support were associated with decreased
levels of WHI (e.g. Lapierre and Allen, 2006; Thompson et al., 1999; Voydanoff,
2004). In addition, fewer organizational time demands were found to be negatively related to WFE (Wayne et al., 2006). Having supportive supervisors
and coworkers may lead to more positive affect, a sense of energy, or confidence from work which carries over the family domain and increases individual
and family functioning (Wayne et al., 2007). Supervisor and coworker support
were indeed linked to higher levels of work-to-family facilitation and enrichment
(e.g. Lu et al., 2009; Siu et al., 2010b; Voydanoff, 2004). Relating the various dimensions of work–family culture with Voydanoff’s (2005a) classification
of boundary-spanning demands and resources, organizational time expectations
can be best understood as boundary-spanning demands, whereas support from
supervisor and colleagues are boundary-spanning resources. Based on theory
(see previous section of the study) and available research evidence, it is hypothesized:
Hypothesis 7. Organizational time expectations will be (a) positively
related to WHI and (b) negatively related to WHE.
Hypothesis 8. Supervisor support will be (a) negatively related to
WHI and (b) positively related to WHE.
Hypothesis 9. Co-worker support will be (a) negatively related to
WHI and (b) positively related to WHE.
In a response to the increasing work and family demands of employees, many
organizations have implemented flexible working arrangements (FWA’s) such as
flextime, compressed work weeks, and telework. Flexible working arrangements
provide employees with temporal or spatial flexibility in the workplace, and may
thus enable them to better manage their work and non-work responsibilities.
Despite contradictory findings about the positive impact of FWA’s on work–
family conflict in two recent meta-analytical studies (Byron, 2005; MesmerMagnus and Viswesvaran, 2006), we argue that by increasing flexibility of and
control over the temporal and spatial boundaries between the work and private
domains, FWA’s have the potential to decrease conflict and increase enrichment
between these domains. In line with previous studies, which have linked flexible
working arrangements to lower levels of work-to-family conflict and increased
levels of work-to-family facilitation (e.g. Anderson et al., 2002; Shockley and
Allen, 2007; Thompson et al., 1999; Voydanoff, 2004), it is hypothesized:
10

Hypothesis 10. Use of flexible work arrangements will be (a) negatively related to WHI and (b) positively related to WHE.

Methods
Procedure and participants
Data for the study were collected from service sector employees in three organizations in the IT, retail and health care industry. The companies were identified
using the German Hoppenstedt Company Inventory, a database comprising information on 300,000 German organizations. Invitations to participate in the
study were sent to the CEO and/or the HR-manager of the respective company.
We collected data using an online questionnaire in the IT organization, and a
paper-and-pencil questionnaire in both the retail and healthcare organization,
because the majority of employees (e.g. shop floor workers, nurses, doctors) in
these organizations did not regularly work on a computer. Online questionnaires were emailed to employees in the IT organization by the HR department,
whereas paper-and-pencil questionnaires were distributed via (internal) mail
to the employees’ work addresses in retail and health care. All participants
were allowed to complete the questionnaire during working hours. A total of
3,138 questionnaires were distributed to employees of various hierarchical levels.
1,042 questionnaires were returned (for an overall response rate of 33 per cent).
After discarding incomplete cases, 999 questionnaires were retained for further
analyses. Further descriptions of the data can be found in Präg et al. (2011).
38.9 per cent of the respondents were male and 61.1 per cent were female.
The average age of respondents was 44.5 years. Seventy-three percent were
married or living together with a partner. Forty-five percent had at least one
child; parents reported an average of 1.6 children. Twenty-six percent of respondents had a high school diploma, 27 per cent had a university degree. Average
organizational tenure was 13.6 years, and 25 per cent had a supervisory position. Twenty-seven percent of the participants worked a part-time schedule of
30 hours or less per week. On average, respondents worked 37.2 hours per week.

Measures
Working hours Participants were asked to indicate how many hours they
actually work per week, including paid or unpaid overtime, but not counting
commuting time.
Overtime on short notice Participants responded on a four-point scale (1
= never; 4 = always) how often they were asked to work paid or unpaid extra
overtime hours with little or no advance notice.

11

Psychological job demands Five items taken from the Swedish Demand–
Control–Support Questionnaire (DCSQ) were used to measure psychological
demands at work (Sanne et al., 2005). Example items are ‘Does your job require
you to work fast?’ and ‘Does your job often make conflicting demands on you?’
Each item was rated on a four-point scale (1 = never; 4 = always).
Job insecurity Four items on a five-point Likert scale were used to measure
perceived job insecurity (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree) (Sverke
et al., 2004). Example items are ‘I am afraid I will lose my job’ and ‘I worry
about keeping my job.’
Job control Job control was assessed with two items taken from the decision
authority scale of the Swedish DCSQ (Sanne et al., 2005), and two items from
the psychological job control measure of Kossek et al. (2006). Example items
are: ‘Are you free to decide how your job is to be done?’ and ‘Are you free to
decide when you do your work?’ Each item was rated on a four-point scale (1
= never; 4 = always).
Job variety Three items of the skill discretion scale of the Swedish Demand–
Control–Support Questionnaire (DCSQ Sanne et al., 2005) were used to assess
job variety. Responses were made on a four-point scale (1 = never; 4 = always).
Example items are ‘Do you get to learn new things?’ and ‘Does your job require
creativity?’
Work–family culture Three items each were used to measure the dimensions organizational time expectations and co-worker support. Two items measured supervisor support. Several items were derived from the multi-dimensional
work–family culture measure of Dikkers et al. (2004). Responses were made on
a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Example
items are ‘In this organization employees are expected to put their job before
their private life when necessary,’ ‘My direct superior supports employees who
want to switch to less demanding jobs for private reasons,’ and ‘My colleagues
support employees who (temporarily) want to reduce their working hours for
private reasons.’ Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using maximum likelihood
estimation provided support for the three-factor solution: χ2 (17, N = 999) =
158.63; CF I = .95; N F I = .95; RM SEA = .08. The fit of the three-factor solution was also compared with a one-factor model and a two-factor model, but
the three-factor model did fit the data significantly better in all instances.
FWA use Participants were asked to indicate whether they had used flextime, telework or worked a compressed workweek over the last twelve months.

12

A dummy-variable was calculated with 0 indicating that no flexible work arrangement had been used, and 1 indicating that at least one policy had been
used over the last twelve months.
Work-to-home interference Three items of the SWING Work–Home Interaction Survey Nijmegen were used to assess WHI (Wagena and Geurts, 2000).
Example items are ‘How often does it happen that you do not have the energy
to engage in leisure activities with your spouse/family/friends because of your
job?’ and ‘How often does it happen that your work obligations make it difficult
to feel relaxed at home?’ Each item was rated on a four-point scale (1 = never;
4 = always).
Work-to-home enrichment Three items taken from the work–family enrichment scale of Carlson et al. (2006) were used to assess the developmental
dimension of WHE. Examples are ‘My involvement in my work helps me to
understand different viewpoints and this helps me be a better family/household
member’ and ‘My involvement in my work helps me acquire skills and this helps
me be a better family/household member.’ Responses were made on a five-point
Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree).
Control variables Sex, age, educational level, supervisor status, marital status, number of children and type of organization were used as control variables
in statistical analyses. Sex is dummy-coded 0 = male, 1 = female, supervisor
status is dummy-coded 0 = non-supervisor, 1 = supervisor, and marital status is
dummy-coded 0 = not married or cohabiting, 1 = married or cohabiting. Type
of organization is dummy-coded with IT as the reference category in multivariate analyses. Educational level was assessed by asking participants to indicate
the highest degree they had obtained on a 7-point scale.

Results
Table 1 presents Pearson’s correlation coefficients, means and standard deviations for all study variables as well as Cronbach’s alphas for the scales with
multiple items.
Ordinary least squares regression analyses were conducted to test the study
hypotheses. Control variables, work demands, work resources, and boundaryspanning demands and resources were entered sequentially into the equation.
In addition to the socio-demographic variables, industry dummy variables were
included in all analyses, with IT as the reference category. The results for WHI
and WHE are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Table 2 shows that several within-domain work demands (working hours:
β = .19, p < .01; overtime on short notice: β = .09, p < .01; psychological time
demands: β = .41, p < .01 and job insecurity: β = .17, p < .01) were positively related to negative work-to-home interference (Model 2). Adding work
resources had hardly any effect on the coefficients. However, when boundaryspanning demands were entered into the equation, overtime on short notice
ceased to be a significant predictor of WHI. Accordingly, Hypothesis 2 was not
supported, whereas Hypotheses 1, 3, and 4 received support by our data. In line
with predictions, organizational time expectations (β = .16, p < .01) were significantly and positively related to WHI, thus confirming Hypothesis 7a. Several
boundary-spanning resources were significantly and negatively related to WHI
(supervisor support (β = −.09, p < .01); co-worker support (β = −.07, p < .05);
FWA use (β = −.09, p < .05). Thus, Hypotheses 8a, 9a, and 10a were supported. No significant relationships were found between within-domain work
resources and WHI, which is in line with our theoretical model in Figure 1.
Table 3 reveals that work demands were not significantly related to WHE
(Model 5), which is in line with our theoretical model. Several boundaryspanning resources, supervisor support (β = .11, p < .01), co-worker support
(β = .12, p < .01), and use of flexible work arrangements (β = .11, p < .05) were
significantly and positively related to WHE, thus confirming Hypotheses 8b,
9b, and 10b. Contrary to predictions, boundary-spanning demands were not
significantly related to WHE. Accordingly, Hypothesis 7a was not supported.
Among job resources, only job variety (β = .12, p < .01) was significantly and
positively related to WHE (Model 5), supporting Hypothesis 6. Contrary to
Hypothesis 5, job control did not reveal a significant relationship with WHE.
Examining the coefficients for control variables in the final models of Tables 2 and 3 reveals that sex was found to be significant in both Tables. Other
things being equal, women experienced both higher work-to-home interference
and higher work-to-home enrichment than men. Supervisors reported significantly higher levels of work-to-home interference due to higher work demands
(Model 1 in Table 2). When these are held constant (Model 2), the difference in WHI between supervisors and non-supervisors becomes insignificant. In
addition, supervisors consistently report significantly higher levels of work-tohome enrichment than employees without supervisor responsibilities (Table 3).
It seems that a management position supplies individuals with more or better
skills and knowledge which translate into a better performance in the family
domain than a non-management position. With respect to industry effects,
there are indications that employees in retail experience less work-to-family enrichment than other employees. However, this relationship is not statistically
significant once boundary-spanning resources are included in the analysis, indicating that retail workers have fewer resources at their disposal than health

Discussion
Summary and interpretation of results
The present paper tested an extended version of Voydanoff’s (2004) ‘differential
salience vs. comparable salience’ model in a sample of German service sector
employees. The model posits that work demands and resources are differentially salient for work–home interference and work–home enrichment, whereas
boundary-spanning demands and resources are comparably salient to both concepts. The present study partially supports the extended salience model, yielding some findings that diverge from Voydanoff’s (2004) theoretical framework
as well as her previous empirical findings. In line with the theoretical model,
work demands including working hours, psychological job demands, and job insecurity were found to be significantly and positively related to WHI. Contrary
to predictions and Voydanoff’s (2004) findings, overtime on short notice was not
significantly related to WHI. The relationship became insignificant once organizational time expectations were taken into account, thereby suggesting that
overtime on short notice may act as a mediator. Being asked to stay longer at
work on short notice seems to create perceptions of a time-demanding organization which does not respect employees’ non-work responsibilities and private life
besides work. Such perceptions constitute an important part of an organizations
work–family culture, and were found to increase employees’ feelings of work negatively interfering with their private life. According to Voydanoff’s (2004) classification of boundary-spanning demands and resources and the salience model,
organizational time expectations are boundary-spanning demands which have a
comparable impact on both forms of work-to-home interference. However, the
present study fails to find a significant relationship between organizational time
expectations and WHE, thereby suggesting that boundary-spanning demands
are differentially rather than comparably salient to the work–family interface.
Several boundary-spanning resources, support from supervisor and colleagues
and the use of flexible working time arrangements yielded significant, negative
relationships with WHI and significant, positive relationships with WHE. Supportive supervisors and co-workers are important resources that enrich employees’ lives and can offset negative work-to-home interference in organizations
with high organizational time expectations. Boundary-spanning resources explained four per cent of the variance in WHI and two per cent of the variance in
WHE, thereby confirming the argument of comparable salience of the theoretical
model.
Among work resources, only job variety was found to be significantly related
to WHE. Contrary to our theoretical model, job control was not significantly re18

lated to work-to-home enrichment. Voydanoff (2004) found a positive, although
small effect (β = .05, p < .05) of job autonomy on work-to-family facilitation.
There are two possible explanations for these divergent findings. The first one
is based on the different dependent variables used in both studies. Whereas
the present study focused on work-to-home enrichment (Greenhaus and Powell,
2006), Voydanoff (2004) looked at work-to-family facilitation. These are different constructs in the work–family literature. Work-family facilitation occurs
when an individual’s engagement in one life domain (e.g. work) results in enhanced functioning of another life domain (e.g. family) (Wayne et al., 2004).
Hence, facilitation focuses on improvements in system (e.g. family) functioning,
whereas enrichment focuses on the improvement of individual performance or
quality of life (Carlson et al., 2006). For example, the application of participative management skills at home may enable an individual to perform more effectively as a parent (enrichment), and may further lead to less conflict and better
parent–child interactions (facilitation) (Wayne, 2009). In addition, whereas the
Voydanoff (2004) measure focuses more on the affective component of facilitation (e.g. moods and energy that are transferred), the present study focuses on
developmental work-to-home enrichment, one of three different dimensions of
WHE (Carlson et al., 2006). Developmental WHE refers to the acquisition or
refinement of skills, knowledge, behaviors, or ways of viewing things rather than
moods and attitudes (affective WFE). Job control/autonomy is a psychological
construct that provides employees with a sense of control, which in turn may
well stimulate affective WFE or the form of facilitation examined by Voydanoff
(2004). However, having control over one’s work may not necessarily provide
employees with tangible skills or knowledge necessary for developmental workto-family enrichment to occur.
A second explanation may be grounded in the respective work environments.
Recent research on contemporary, post-Fordist work environments yielded some
ambiguous findings with respect to job control and employee behaviors and
work-to-home interference. Van Echtelt et al. (2006), for example, found that
employees in organizations which provided them with high levels of control over
working time and location, worked much longer hours than they actually wanted
to (the ‘autonomy paradox’). In these work environments the focus was on task
and project completion rather than on clock time. Employees were so immersed
in completing their work tasks and projects that they spent even more time at
work. Although they formally had the right to adjust their working hours, the
work environment did not allow an actual reduction. Contrary to the view that
schedule control and job autonomy are resources that decrease WHI, Schieman
and Glavin (2008) hold them responsible for a ‘blurring’ of the borders between
work and home. They were able to show that this work–home role blurring
is associated with increased levels of work-to-home conflict. In a similar vein,

19

Schieman et al. (2009) found that employees with high levels of authority and
decision-making latitude experienced higher levels of negative work-to-home interference. They argued that because of certain ‘cultural dictates’ (p. 986)
about flexibility in organizations, work resources might not realize their positive impact on the work–non-work interface. These studies thus provide some
indication that job control may only exert its positive impact on work-to-home
enrichment under certain organizational conditions. Future research may apply
a more complex view of the relationships between within-domain and boundaryspanning demands and resources and the work–family interface (e.g. by including interactions between various demands and resources).
To summarize, work resources explained two per cent of the variance on
WHE. Neither job control nor job variety revealed a significant relationship
with work-to-home interference. Despite the non-significant relationship between overtime on short notice and WHI, work demands explained 33 per cent
of the variance in WHI. No significant relationships were found between workdemands and WHE. Boundary-spanning resources were comparably salient to
WHI (four per cent of variance explained) and WFE (two per cent of variance
explained), whereas boundary-spanning demands were only find to salient to
WHI. Overall, these findings partially confirm our extended salience model.

Theoretical and applied implications
The findings of the present study have several theoretical implications. First,
the study tested Voydanoff’s (2004) differential salience vs. comparable salience
model in a different national context. To our knowledge, the model has only
been tested with a US sample of employees. However, testing theoretical models, especially across different national/cultural settings, are important before
firm conclusions can be drawn. Further, the present study extends Voydanoff’s
(2004) model by including boundary-spanning demands which have been suggested by Voydanoff (2005a). However, our findings, drawn from a German
sample of service sector employees, suggest that boundary-spanning demands
are differentially salient rather than comparably salient to WHI and WHE. With
respect to boundary-spanning resources, our study confirms that there is a merit
in distinguishing boundary-spanning resources as conceptually different from
within-domain resources as they are related to both WHI and WHE. Finally,
the study provides initial empirical evidence on antecedents of work-to-home
enrichment in a German work context.
From an applied perspective, the findings of the present study suggest that
organizations which aim at reducing employees’ work-to-home conflict need to
go beyond the mere reduction of work demands and create a family-supportive
work environment. This is a challenging and long-term task for organizations,
but the findings of this study suggest that it is worthwhile for companies to
20

engage in this endeavor. It is particularly beneficial for organizations to invest
into employees’ boundary-spanning resources because support from supervisor
and colleagues as well as flexible work arrangements (all important components
of a family-supportive work environment) were found to lead to two positive
consequences for employees: less negative work-to-home interference and higher
work-to-home enrichment. In addition, organizations need to be careful in creating perceptions of a time-demanding organization that does not respect employees’ non-work obligations. Once established, deeply held beliefs, assumptions,
and values about the priority of work and family life are difficult to change
(Andreassi and Thompson, 2008).

Limitations and future research suggestions
When interpreting the results of the present study, several limitations of the research design should be kept in mind. First, the sample is comprised of service
sector employees, meaning that the results may not generalize to a larger population of workers. Future studies would benefit from investigating a broader
array of industries. A second limitation of the study is its cross-sectional, nonexperimental design which does not allow for definite causal conclusions (Spector, 2002; Stone-Romero and Rosopa, 2007).
Although the results of the study are largely consistent with the assumed
causal model in Figure 1, we cannot rule out rival explanations of detected relationships. Experimental research designs and longitudinal studies are required
in the future to clearly determine the directionality of the proposed relationships.
Further, all variables were self-reported by the study participants, introducing
the possibility that common method variance may influence the results. In order to empirically address this issue, Lindell and Whitney’s (2001) partialling
technique was applied in this study. Correlations remained significant, suggesting that the results are not significantly affected by common method variance.
However, future research should definitely aim at collecting data from multiple
data sources.
Apart from methodological improvements, several content-related suggestions for future research can be pointed out. As already mentioned in the discussion section, the present study examines a different concept of positive workto-home interference, namely work-to-home enrichment (Greenhaus and Powell,
2006), as compared to work-to-family facilitation in the Voydanoff (2004) study.
A further check for the robustness of the ‘differential salience vs. comparable
salience’ model across different cultural and national contexts would be to use
the same constructs and measures. In addition, the present study only focused
on the developmental dimension of work-to-home enrichment (Carlson et al.,
2006) and applied a uni-dimensional measure of work-to-home interference (Wagena and Geurts, 2000). Future studies may assess whether work and boundary21

spanning demands and resources relate differently to other dimensions of WHE
and WHI. Finally, future research may include different boundary-spanning demands (e.g. bring work home) to further clarify whether these demands are
comparably or differentially salient to the work–family interface.
