The Impacts of Climatic and Non-climatic Factors on Household Food
Security of the Malaysian East Coast Poor
Abstract
Sustainable food security at household level is a national concern in many countries. The
reasons for household food insecurity include social, economic, political, and personal factors
as well as climatic changes and its outcomes. This research aims at finding out the linkage of
the factors of climatic changes, non-climatic factors and household resiliencies with the level
of household food security among the poor and low income households in Malaysia. This
study is based on primary data that were collected in Jul-Oct 2012 through a questionnaire
survey on 460 poor and low income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu
States of Malaysia. The sample was selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on
cluster random sampling technique. Initially the study measures household food security
according to the USAID-HFIA model, and ran ordinal regressions under the logit and probit
models. This study finds that household food insecurity is not only linked with social and
economic factors, but also significantly linked with the climatic factors. Therefore, the food
security programs need to be integrated with the adaption programs for climatic change.

1. Introduction
The 2008 global food crisis serves as a prelude to a more acute food crisis in the future. As a
result, food security is now a national issue for many countries. The major food security
concern is about making agricultural production sufficient for domestic consumption and
capability for making food available and accessible from international markets.
Sustainable food security at the household level is also equally important because
national food security is not enough to ensure sustainable food security at the household
level. The drivers of household food security are in fact more crucial than national level
because while food security is defined in its most basic form as access by all people at all
times to foods needed for a healthy life (FAO 2003:28). As such, the focus of food security
should be on the household as the basic unit in the society. This distinction is important
because activities directed towards improving household food security may be quite different
from those aimed at improving food security in general.
There are many factors that drive household food insecurity. According to Lovendal
and Knowles (2006), these factors include political, economic, environment, natural, social,
infrastructural, and health issues. Frankenberge (1992) puts forward that assets, community
inequalities, risk-minimizing strategies, and coping strategy are also important drivers.
Nyariki and Wiggins (1997) gives utilization of physical, natural, and human resources,
availability of technology, and off-farm jobs as factors that drives household to food
insecurity. Workneh (2006) mentions that the major drivers are capability to produce own
food, growth of purchasing power. Iram and Butt (2004), ECA (2004), Cristofar and Basiotis
(1992), and Olson et al. (1997) and Rose et al. (1995) adds household’s demography, access
to land, land tenure system, ability to utilize the land productively, and savings to the list of
2

factors. Other researchers, such as Fartahun et al. (2007), Hindin (2006), Myntti (1993),
Pfeiffer et al. (2001) Piaseu (2006) and Workneh (2006), widens the list to include women
with income-earning capability, women education, sufficient income, number of children,
social support, accessibility to productive resources, educational level, land holdings,
accessibility to transport, livestock productivity, awareness of suitable interventions, storage
technology, and unemployment level.
Changes in the climatic factors and its outcomes would also affect household food
security. According to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and Fourth
Assessment Report, food security and malnutrition will be severely affected by climate
change and variability (IPCC 2007a). FAO (2008 and 2007) has also stressed that climate
change affects the availability of food, food supply stability, accessibility to food and
utilization of food. This in turn results in negative impacts on nutrition and food security.
Water scarcity and droughts reduce the nutritional diversity and decrease the general food
consumption, which would cause malnutrition such as micronutrient deficiencies, proteinenergy malnutrition, and under nutrition (IPCC 2007). The increase in rainfall, temperature,
sea levels, salinity give rise to flooding in human settlement areas. (Cruz et al. 2007Mimura
et al. 2007). It may also causescarcity of freshwater (Kundzewicz et al. 2007), increase
diarrhea and other contagious diseases (Checkley et al. 2000; Kovats et al. 2004; Zimmerman
et al. 2007). Climatic changes also have impacts on food distribution, influencing people’s
access to markets to sell or purchase food (Abdulai and CroleRees 2001), increase food
prices (Cline 2007; von Braun 2007), and reduce real income (Thomsen & Metz 1998).
Malaysia is a fast developing country with a fairly diversified economy. According to
EIA (2005), carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Malaysia have increased by 221% during the
period from 1990 to 2004 and is included in the list of 30 biggest greenhouse gas emitters.
Global warming is expected to elevated temperature by 0.3-4.5°C. Warmer temperature will
cause sea level rise by about 95cm over a hundred-year period and changes in rainfall
between -30% to +30%. It reduces crop yield and cause drought in many areas so that
cultivation of some crops will not be possible (MOSTE 2001). Moreover, projections on
maximum monthly precipitation to increase by 51% over Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu,
while minimum precipitation decreases between 32% and 61% for the whole of Peninsular
Malaysia. Consequently, annual rainfall may increase up to 10% in Kelantan, Terengganu,
Pahang and North West Coast, and decrease up to 5% in Selangor and Johor (NAHRIM
2006). Tisdell finds that rainfall variability increases the level of environmental stress that
affects the capability of the system to maintain productivity (Tisdell 1996).
Under the current climate change scenario, temperatures above 25oC may reduce
grain mass at 4.4% per 1oC rise (Tashiro 1989), and grain yield may decline as much as
9.6%-10.0% per 1oC rise (Baker 1993). Singh et al. (1996) reveals that the actual farm yields
of rice in Malaysia vary from 3-5 tons per hectare, where potential yield is 7.2 tons. The
study also unfolds that there is a decline in rice yield between 4.6%-6.1% per 1oC
temperature increase and that doubling of CO2 concentration (from present level of 340ppm
to 680ppm) which may offset the detrimental effect of 4oC temperature increase on rice
production in Malaysia. Overall, based on the analysis of minimum and maximum yield of
the last 28 years, the macro cases of the national data from 1980 to 2008 of Malaysia show
that the yield of paddy would decrease between 43% and 61% if there is a 1oC temperature
and 1 millimeter (mm) rainfall increase (Ali and Ali 2009). In a recent study, based on the
micro data on paddy field of Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA), it was found
that in North-West Selangor, temperature increased by 1% which might lead to 3.44%
3

decrease in current paddy yield and 0.03% decrease in paddy yield in the following season;
and rainfall increased by 1% which might lead to 0.12% decrease in current paddy yield and
0.12% decrease in paddy yield in the following season (Alam et al. 2014).
Malaysia joined 185 other nations in signing the Declaration of Rome at the 1996
International Food Summit, pledging to reduce the prevalence of hunger by at least 50%,
within its own jurisdiction, by a target date some time in the early 21st century. However, in
Malaysia, the food security has been embedded into the theme of self-sufficiency level that
referred to paddy or rice sector only (Arshad et al. 1999; Alam et al. 2011; 2012a), instead of
having a specific or special policy on overall food security. To ensure food security in
Malaysia, the government adopts two strategies, such as establishing self-sufficiency level
and building rice stocks both domestically and internationally. However, Malaysia has never
met the food self-sufficiency level. About 10% to 35% of total required rice is imported from
neighboring countries, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. The
highest food self-sufficiency level for the country was 95% and the lowest was 65%, which
were recorded in 1975 and 1990 respectively.
As climate change is one of the major potential threats to national food security in
Malaysia, there is a strong possibility that climatic change is linked with household food
security of the country. To ensure food security and proper policy options in Malaysia, it is
very important to study the current situation of household food security and the linkage
between the changes in climatic factors and sustainable food security at household level.
Very few works have been conducted on the impacts of changes in climatic factors and its’
outcomes on household food security in Malaysia (Alam et al., 2016a; 2016b). Hence, this
paper is an attempt to conduct an in depth study on this issue. The findings of this study will
be helpful for the policy makers to achieve the Vision 2020 – to become a fully developed
nation by the year of 2020 – and setting targets in national development plans on food
security, socioeconomic betterment, and poverty alleviation.
2. Data, Model and Methodology
2.1 Data Collection
For the empirical assessment, this study mostly relies on primary data that are collected
through an extensive questionnaire survey at household level in East Coast Economic Region
(ECER) in Malaysia. This study has selected ECER as the study area because ECER is more
than half of the Peninsular Malaysia with the area of about 66,000 sq kilometer that covers
the states Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and the district of Mersing in Johor (Figure 1).
ECER is very crucial for two major reasons; (a) ECER is the most vulnerable area in
Malaysia due to climatic changes and (b) the income level of this region is low and poverty
rate is high that is a hindrance to achieve vision 2020 (Alam et al., 2012b; ECER Master
Plan. 2007, 2008). The population of ECER was about 3.95 million,
which represents 14.8% of the total population of Malaysia in 2005. In 2004 the incidences of
poverty were 10.6%, 4%, and 15.4% in Kelantan, Pahang, and Terengganu respectively,
whereas for overall Malaysia it was 5.7%, and the incidences of hardcore poverty were 1.3%,
1.0%, and 4.4% in Kelantan, Pahang, and Terengganu respectively, whereas for overall
Malaysia it was 1.2%. At that time, there were about 45,000 paddy farmers in the ECER, and
the average productivity per worker was RM 11,915 whereas the national agriculture
productivity per worker was RM 15,355.

4

ECER is mainly an agricultural region. In 2004, all crops production covered a total
area of 2.22 million ha in the ECER (34.8% of Peninsular Malaysia). However, in 2008
government officially launched a very large development project to develop five key areas –
manufacturing, oil, gas & petrochemicals, tourism, agriculture and human capital
development. With the objective of fast-forwarding the inflow of FDI and industrialization in
the region, ECER Special Economic Zone (ECER SEZ) and Malaysia-China Kuantan
Industrial Park were initiated in this area. Therefore, ECER is expected to implement projects
worth an estimated RM 112 billion in value by year 2020. The ECER Special Economic Zone
(SEZ) is expected to generate up to RM 90 billion in investments and contribute RM 23
billion to the national GDP, as well as create 220,000 new jobs out of the 560,000 jobs
identified.

The study follows two-stage cluster random sampling technique. Initially the samples
are clustered by location and then by poverty category. Finally, from each category, samples
are picked randomly from the E-Kasih database – which is an integrated database system that
enlisted poor households at the national level to plan, implement and monitor poverty
programs. The urban area of Kuantan and rural area of Pekan is selected from Pahang state.
The urban area of Kota Bharu and rural area of Tumpat is selected from Kelantan state. The
urban area of Kuala Terengganu and rural area of Marang is selected from Terengganu state.
Based on the formula of required size of samples (Yamane, 1967: 886), first, 400
households were selected according to the proportion of population distribution. However, to
ensure a good number of observations for each group, which was needed for sound statistical
analysis for any particular group, another 100 households were added to the sample.
However, while targeting the sample size to be 500, after collecting and validating the data,
finally, 460 households remained in the sample. The final distribution of the collected sample
is given in the Table 1.

* In the E-Kasih system, the rural poverty data were categorized as monthly income per person up to
RM110 is hard-core poor, up to RM185 is poor, and up to RM227 is marginally non-poor, and for
urban area up to RM120 is hard-core poor, up to RM200 is poor, and up to RM340 is marginally nonpoor.

A face-to-face interview based on structured questionnaire is used to collect data,
where the respondents provide the answers and the enumerators filled-up the questionnaire.
The survey is conducted by the regular enumerators of the Implementation Coordination Unit
(ICU) agency from Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu in Jul-Oct 2012.
2.2 Model Specification
To measure the relationship between household status of food security and the climatic and
general factors affecting on food security, the following ordered dependent regression or
ordinal regression is conducted based on logit and probit models:
Zi= (Y1, Y2)
Xi= (X1, …, X63)
Zi=ƒ (Xi)

(1)

In this study, the two dependent variables, the household status of food accessibility
and household food availability, are considered as the measurements of household food
security. Household food availability is based on measurement on the direct perception of the
household, where household status of food accessibility measurement was based on the
frequency of calculation. To measure the status of household food availability, households
have been asked about their food status in last one month (see Table 2), and to measure the
status of household food accessibility, this study follows direct measuring questionnairebased techniques developed by Coates et al. (2007) for USAID which is known as Household
Food Insecurity Access (HFIA) (Table 3).
The list of the independent variables of the study consists of different resilience
factors of household (X1-X18), non-climatic factors (X18-X44), and climatic factors (X45X63). These variables are considered from all of the four dimensions of food security –
availability of food, stability of supply, accessibility to food, and utilization of food (FAO,
2005, 2008). The availability of food means sufficient quantities of quality food available at
household level. The accessibility of food means household’s access to sufficient resources,
including a set of all commodity bundles that an individual can gain access based on the
legal, economic, political, and social arrangement of a community in which they live, for
getting quality foods for a nutritious meal. Food utilization shows the significance of nonfood inputs in food security such as proper diet, clean water, healthcare, and sanitation to gain
nutritional well-being where all physiological requirements are met. Food system stability
refers to a households having access to sufficient food at all times so that they should not risk
losing access to food as a result of sudden crisis such as an economic or climatic crisis or
6

cyclical occurrence such as seasonal food insecurities. Here, the resilience refers to the
households' capacity or strength to cope with stress and hardship in case of actual or expected
food insecurity which are categorized as socioeconomic, physical assets, and livelihood
strategy and behavior. The measurements of all of the variables are given in the appendix.
To check the best fit model and robustness, this study reports both the probit and logit
model, but for analysis it mostly focuses on the logit model. Logit and probit model looks
like a sigmoid function with a domain between 0 and 1, which makes them both quantile
functions based on the assumption that logit model that follows logistic distribution and
probit model follows normal distribution. Normally, pogit model is used when every
observation has equal probability. Furthermore, a correlation analysis is undertaken in order to
find out the relationship among the relevant variables and to check the multicollinearity
problem. Finally, this study also justifies how the endogeneity and causality problems are
considered under the study.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Measurement of Household Food Security
In terms of household food availability, 14.8% say they have enough food what they like, but
majority (41.1%) of the households mention that always they don’t have enough kind of food
they like. 9.1% of the households mention that they frequently stay hungry (Table 2).

Household Food Insecurity Access (HFIA) is calculated for each household by
assigning a code 1-4, where 1=Food Secure Access, 2=Mildly Food Insecure Access,
3=Moderately Food Insecure Access, 4=Severely Food Insecure Access. Initially the data are
coded frequency-of-occurrence as 0 for all cases where the answer to the corresponding
occurrence question is “no” (i.e., if Q1=0 then Q1a=0, etc.). Then the intensities of the
occurrence of nine questions are measured in three frequencies – rarely (1-2 times per month)
or sometimes (3-10 times) or often (10+ times per month) – which indicate by Q1a to Q9a
(Table 3). Finally, the four food accessibility categories are created sequentially, to ensure
that households are classified according to their most severe response.

Category = 1 if [(Q1=0 or Q1=1) and Q2=0 and Q3=0 and Q4=0

The following table illustrates the above four categorizations, where every household
is placed in a single, unique category based on the set of the responses (Table 3).

Based on the survey, this study finds that 52.8% of the households are under the
category of “food secure access”. Among the surveyed households, 23.3% are facing mildly
food insecurity (access) who are worried about not having enough food sometimes or often,
and/or unable to eat preferred foods, and/or rarely eat a more monotonous diet than desired
and/or also rarely eat some undesirable foods (Table 4).

Among the households, 14.3% are moderately food insecure. These households
frequently sacrifice quality of food by eating a monotonous diet or undesirable foods
8

sometimes or often, and/or reduce eating the quantity of food rarely or sometimes. There are
9.6% of households that are severely food insecure who has graduated to cutting back on
meal size or number of meals often, and/or experiences any of the three most severe
conditions – running out of food, going to bed hungry, or going a whole day and night
without eating – even as infrequently as rarely or at least once in the previous month (see
details in Alam et al. 2016a).
3.2 Household Status of Food Security and Relevant Factors

The regression models based on Equation 1 show that some of the resilience factors have
statistically significant relationship with household food availability and food accessibility
(Table 5). The P-values of the likelihood ratio (LR) statistics for both models are shown
below 0.0000001 that suggest a very good fit of the models. The pseudo R-squares are 0.354
for food availability and 0.305 for the food accessibility models.
Results for household food availability (Y1) models indicate that the climatic impacts
on kitchen environment (X58) and sanitation system (X60) are statistically significant.
Among the non-climatic/general factors, competition for common resources (X31), common
resources dependency for cattle or livestock feeding (X30), incidences of disease like dengue,
malaria, heat stretch, cold, skin disease (X44), having knowledge about taking precaution
against dengue, malaria (X17), buying bulk amount of food (X12), household
poverty/economic status (X3), earning ratio (X6), and number of school going children (X2)
are statistically significant.

In terms of odds ratios, results from the availability of food at household (Y1) logit
model indicates that holding other things constant, for a unit increase in the common
resources dependency for cattle or livestock feeding (X30), the odds in favor of availability
of food at household (Y1) increases by 1.823 or about 82.3%. Similarly, there is a 160.2%
increase of odds of availability of food in the household (Y1) for a one-unit increase in
knowledge about taking precaution against dengue, malaria (X17). The odds of household
10

food availability (Y1) for household buying bulk amount of food (X12) is 304.6% higher
than the odds of household food availability (Y1) for household without buying bulk amount
of food. For a unit increase in the earning ratio (X6), the odds in favor of availability of food
at household (Y1) increases by 1.412 or about 41.2%
Holding other things constant, for a unit increase in climatic issues affecting kitchen
environment (X58) where the odds in favor of unavailability of food in the household (Y1)
increases by (1-0.329) or about 67.1%. Similarly, there is a 33.8% increase of odds of
unavailability of food at household (Y1) for a one-unit increase in competition for common
resources (X31). For a unit increase in poverty level or decrease of household
poverty/economic status (X3), the odds in favor of unavailability of food at household (Y1)
increases by (1-0.59) or about 41%. Similarly, there is a 47.2% increase of odds of
unavailability of food at household (Y1) for a one-unit increase in number of school going
children (X2).
Results for household status of food accessibility (Y2) models show that among the
climatic factors, natural disasters at local level (X45), and climatic impact on income (X46),
climatic impact on household food storage system (X48), climatic impact on household
sanitation system (X60), and climatic impact on increases of short term food prices (X62) are
statistically significant. Among the non-climatic/general factors, prices of general food items
(X22), difference between rural and city food prices (X23), low level of income (X26),
incidences of mosquitoes, insects, pest (X43), incidences of disease (X44), household
transportation (X11), household poverty/economic status (X3), earning ratio (X6), spouse
doing job (X4), and number of school going children (X2) are statistically significant.
According to the probit model, households having savings (X7) also show a statistically
significant relationship with household status of food accessibility.
With reference to the food accessibility at household (Y2) logit model, the odds ratio
indicate that holding other things constant, for a unit increase in climatic impact on household
food storage system (X48), the odds in favor of food security at household (Y2) increases by
2.269 or about 126.9%. Similarly, there is a 80% increase of odds of food accessibility at
household (Y2) for a one-unit increase earning ratio (X6). The odds of household food
accessibility (Y2) for household having transportation (X11) is 176.9% higher than the odds
of household without having transportation. The odds of household accessibility (Y2) for
spouse doing job (X4) is 319.1% higher than the odds of household without spouse doing job.
The odds of household food accessibility (Y2) for household have savings (X7) is 48.9%
higher than the odds of household without having savings.
For this model, the odds on climatic factors indicate that holding other things
constant, for a unit increase in natural disasters at local level (X45), the odds in favor of food
accessibility at household (Y2) decreases by (1-0.747) or about 25.3%. Similarly, there is a
69.7% decrease of odds of food accessibility at household (Y2) for a one-unit increase in
climatic impact on income (X46). For a unit increase in climatic impact on increases of short
time food prices (X62), the odds in favor of food accessibility at household (Y2) decreases by
(1-0.731) or about 26.9%. Similarly, there is a 33.7% decrease of odds of food accessibility at
household (Y2) for a one-unit increase in prices of general food items (X22). For a unit
increase in difference between rural and city food prices (X23), the odds in favor of food
accessibility at household (Y2) decreases by (1-0.63) or about 37%. Similarly, there is a
31.8% decrease of odds of food accessibility at household (Y2) for a one-unit increase in low
level of income (X26). For a unit increase in incidences of disease (X44), the odds in favor of
11

food accessibility at household (Y2) decreases by (1-0.741) or about 25.9%. Similarly, there
is a 28.1% decrease of odds of food accessibility at household (Y2) for a one-unit increase in
household poverty/economic status (X3). For a unit increase in number of school going
children (X2), the odds in favor of food accessibility at household (Y2) decreases by (10.486) or about 51.4%.
However, in the model, some of the variables show statistically significantly
unexpected sign in respect to their relationship with household food security such as the
climatic impacts on sanitation system (X60) and the incidences of disease (X44) show the
odds in favor of availability of food at household (Y1). Similarly, climatic impact on
household sanitation system (X60) and incidences of mosquitoes, insects, pest, etc. (X43)
show the odds in favor of food accessibility at household (Y2). Therefore, new additional
studies need to be undertaken to justify these unusual behavior of these few variables.
3.3 Model Efficiency Test
To identify if there are any multicollinearity problems present among the variables, the
Pearson Correlation tests have been performed in the study. When two variables are
considered highly correlated to each other in explaining the dependent variable, it may give
rise to a multicollinearity problem. In case of multicollinearity, the correlation value is
considered as 0.8 or above (Field, 2000: 2, 44-322). The result shows that the correlation
values among the variables fall below 0.8, which indicates that multicollinearity is absent
among the variables.
Moreover, logically this study is free from endogeneity (including causality) problem
because in the survey questions were asked about the impact of different factors on food
security not vice versa. Moreover, technically the ordered dependent regression or ordinal
regression is based on the “Generalized Linear Models” (used by EViews) and “Generalized
structural equation model” (used by Stata) where the software itself takes some instrumental
variables to solve the endogeneity problems.
4. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
This study finds that several resilience factors, climatic factors, and non-climatic factors are
statistically significant to explain the household status of food security. These variables also
differ between food secure and insecure groups.
Climate change is one of the major potential threats for household food security in
Malaysia (Alam et al., 2010, 2011). Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security
in the country, design of food security programs must integrate climatic change into the
picture, and food security approaches must recognize climate change as an important driver.
This integration also increases household capacity to adapt to climatic change. At the same
time, climate change adaptation approaches and strategies to reduce vulnerability to climate
change also increases household food security.
Prioritization of needs for investment targeted at increasing food security adaptation
to climate change is important. Climate change adaptations are concentrated on improving
the potential of people, especially the most vulnerable groups, toward adapting to climate
changes. This involves support for livelihoods that are climate-resilient, reduction of disaster
risk, advocacy, empowerment, and social mobilization to curb the underlying causes of
12

vulnerability (Alam et al. 2012a). To adequately deal with the effects of climate change on
food security, plans have to chalk out with a good analysis of the groups that are already
particularly marginal at present. They are the most affected by climate change often, and they
have very limited capacities to cope with.
Therefore, climate change affects groups that have always been at risk of food
insecurity, and it also affects new groups who become vulnerable to regional weather
changing conditions (IPCC, 2007). Most vulnerable groups already practice some form of
risk management, but their capability to adapt to climatic changes is often limited due to their
extremely restricted coping-up potential. Thus, the climate change adaptation techniques and
food security should empower the groups that are socially excluded to lower their
vulnerability and improve their resilience (Stern, 2007; Pielke et al., 2007; FAO, 1997). Work
on adaptation must address food security as a main challenge faced by the populations that
are vulnerable to the climate, while food security plans in most cases offer to people’s
capability to adapt to changes in climate, specifically when climate change is taken explicitly
into consideration.
The mitigation options are important when planning for a long future. In the long run,
the people who are vulnerable should be empowered and encouraged to adapt to climate
change by developing resilience via investments in health, social protection, education,
infrastructure, and other methods. Monitoring weather extremes and design strategies for
disaster preparation are also very important. Given these effects and the resources needed to
adapt them, resources that realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) might be
integrated. Further, the private sector should advocate mitigation methods like energy
efficiency, renewable energy, developments and infrastructure which include dams, floodresistant storage facilities, cyclone shelters, and techniques for lowering water loss in
distribution systems, etc.
Finally, local, national, and regional administrations must be provided with adequate
resources to deal with challenges of climate changes. They should put emphasis for the
building of capacity in communities that are particularly at risk for food insecurity as well as
climatic changes. We also suggest that new additional studies be undertaken to validate or
reject the overall findings of our study. The findings of the study are empirically very new.
Therefore, there are huge scopes to explore this issue further. The results of this study can be
investigated further and validated against other socioeconomic factors, demographic factors,
different locations, different economic groups, and different measurements of level of food
security.
