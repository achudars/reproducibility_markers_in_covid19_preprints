Abstract
The present research paper is a plea for a reform policy of English Language Education in Algerian
secondary-school education. It attempts to redraw the boundaries of English as a Foreign Language
(EFL) from a teaching-testing perspective based on two fundamental questions: the ‘what-toteach’ and the ‘what-to-test’, which represent the rationale of Algerian EFL classrooms. It also
expands into a discussion of the discrepancies existing between stated objectives and classroom
practice. This deviation from the prescribed syllabus is dictated by the Baccalaureate exam, a
standardized test par excellence and the ‘entry visa’ to university. The study was carried out with
a sample population composed of twenty-eight male and female students from the English
Department of the University of Tlemcen, Algeria during the first term of the academic year 20182019. The data collected tools employed in this pilot experimental study, a pre-unit test (a pretest), remedial activities, and a post-test, were conducted on the sample at the end of the
experiment. The research paper culminates with a formulation of initial pedagogical steps that are
likely to develop students’ communicative abilities within an exam-centric education system
characterized by a grammar-focused and vocabulary-building test-oriented teaching. Hence, to
negotiate a balanced approach that would accommodate both effective teaching and efficient
testing.

Introduction
The increasing importance assigned to testing and assessment within a highly exam-centric
education system has given birth to the proliferation of a pedagogical ‘malpractice’ which has de
facto imposed itself in many EFL classrooms forcing, therefore, teachers, in the name of politicoeducational considerations, to devote most of their teaching time to students test preparation. The
term ‘malpractice’ is put between inverted commas for a good reason that is explicitly stated in
many parts of this article. The overtly-manifested importance attached to scoring well in exams,
be they low stakes or high stakes, has set the pace for the EFL teaching-learning process, as high
scores have become indicative of high-quality schooling. The term ‘achievement’ has, thus, lost
its intrinsic value in the sense that it means nothing more than scoring well on tests, deviating,
therefore, teachers to teach for the test and students to learn for the test respectively. However,
teachers ought to be able to show that students are learning English and in parallel inculcate in
their learners that ability to use the language appropriately both receptively and productively in
real situations, to use an alternative definition of communicative competence. Time and again, the
teacher has proven to be the most influential school-related force in student achievement (Stronge,
2018).
Undeniably, English Language Teaching (ELT) may add something to the learners’ inheritance,
[and the Algerian EFL learner is no exception] as familiarity with other languages might add
something to ours (Barrow, 1990). Thus, English Language Education, in our opinion a more
comprehensive term, will be used throughout this article as a substitute to both ELT and EFL
teaching-learning. Yet how can English Language Education, as such, be reconsidered and
appraised in the light of the 21st century communications schemes? The task does not seem to be
an easy one. In Algeria, the French language still takes the lead in economic development,
technological advancement and commercial expansion. What is more, the Francophone lobby and
the ‘angel guardians’ of the French language are still out there blocking the road for the emergence
of other languages, not least English.
1. Statement of the Problem
1.1. High Scores: High-Quality Schooling
Rightly or wrongly, grades and marks have always been used as signposts to learning and
seemingly reliable pedagogical indices. Stiggins (2007) describes the use of standardized testing
in the 1950s as a means to compare and rank schools, school districts, states and nations. This
high-stakes testing results culture is still a commonplace heresy in the educational milieu in
Algeria. Boards of Education, school principals and headmasters not only have recourse to results
data to track the performance of their educational institution but compare their school’s
performance with that of other institutions in the province or county.
Admittedly, if learners’ performance is viewed this way and hijacked for, non-elitist or at least
non-meritocratic purposes, the Algerian education system ought, therefore, to go through a radical
change and English Language Education a metamorphosis. However, how to avoid unintended
consequences and resulting ‘side-effects’ when setting goals remains the crux of the matter to be
documented in the present research work.

1.2. Research Questions
This pedagogical perspective reflects a serious endeavour to change the traditional relationship of
assessment to learning in a probationary year where students are to sit for the Baccalaureate exam.
It is curious to note that at this level, paradoxically, formal examinations often hinder rather than
help students learn English for communicative purposes. However, authentic and meaningful
communication should be the ultimate goal of language activities in an English Language
Education classroom.
Nonetheless, it is this growing interest in the teach-to-the-test approach that provides the basis
for this article; it will address the following questions:
1. What are the main communicative deficiencies that first-year EFL students lack due to an
intensive grammar and vocabulary-focused test-oriented teaching (See Appendix A) in
secondary education, especially during their third probationary year?
2. How can teachers at university level help EFL students make up for that serious deficit in
students’ communicative abilities to achieve functional ability in English Language
Education?
1.3. Research Hypotheses
In an attempt to provide satisfactory answers to the research questions mentioned earlier, we have
constructed our hypotheses which formally stated are:
1. First-year EFL students display some serious deficiencies in terms of language use. This
represents a major handicap affecting negatively their communicative abilities as a result
of an English Language Education which draws heavily on the principles of the teach-tothe-test approach at the secondary education level as a preparation for the Baccalaureate
Exam.
2. First-Year EFL students can be offered supplementary learning sessions aiming to upgrade
their communicative abilities. This compensatory language adjustment would consist of
communication-based activities.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Genesis of a System
The current positivist-oriented education system with its emphasis on the acquisition of facts is, in
effect, a legacy of the French colonial times. The French education system, heavily imbued with
the Napoleonic thought, was highly marred by hierarchical hurdles that had to be passed before
moving up from a lower level to a higher one. This is how an exam-centric model of education
works and this is the model which independent Algeria inherited from France and is being
practised and perpetuated in post-independent Algeria. This state of affairs illustrates clearly that
there has never been a deep concern among education policymakers about many aspects of
education. Educationalists’ attempts at reforms have always been well intended, but rarely have
professionals had the opportunity to participate in the solving of background educational issues.
Worse still, attempts at reforming the education system have always moved in the reverse order,
i.e. at the expense of academic standards. On the other hand, the pseudo-reform committee

meetings are deliberately orchestrated to gain the acceptance of what has already been taken before
the meeting and allow only ‘cosmetic changes’. One may add for the purposes of this argument
and making use of statistical evidence, that the success in the Baccalaureate exam noticed a steep
fall in its rate. In the 1970s, the rate of success was between 60% and 70% (Benghabrit-Remaoun,
1998); at present, it oscillates between 50% and 55% (2016: 49.79%; 2017: 56.07%; 2018: 55.88%
Algérie Presse Service, July 2018).
Demands and calls for a global and profound educational reform and the inception of a qualitybased education have always been the hobbyhorse of many opposition parties. Though the
situation stands in a different light today, it is not likely to change soon. An exam-centric education
system may be at odds with the requirements of the 21st century constructivist-oriented educational
paradigms, and as Bolitho (2012) posits:
There is no doubt that in educating the citizens of tomorrow, we should be preparing them to cope
with change in our increasingly globalised world. Among other things, this seems to mean laying
emphasis on using language as a tool for communication and accessing information. These features
should be in evidence in the curriculum and in textbooks as well as in classroom practices. (p. 35).
2.2. Clearing the Ground
The core of the issue in the present article is, in effect, an attempt to understand how a pedagogical
‘malpractice’, driven by high-stakes testing, influences stakeholders’ perception of English
Language Education from a teaching-testing perspective. This approach to language teachinglearning-testing has led to the emergence of a number of alternative terms and phrases, item
teaching, curriculum teaching, test-oriented teaching and teaching to the test, to refer to a
classroom setting in which testing is regarded as an end in its self rather than a by-product which
the student will take in his stride (Alexander, 1972). For the sake of methodological uniformity,
the term teach-to-the-test approach will be used throughout this research work...
2.3. Defining an Approach
The term teaching to the test is used to refer to the implementation of an ensemble of in-class
pedagogical practices and activities and out-of-school remedial coaching services aiming primarily
to prepare learners for standardized tests and high-stakes exams, and by extension to cover all
types of exams and tests. This approach to language pedagogy is very likely to lead to a type of
teaching and learning which focuses on a mere reproduction of memorized isolated grammatical
items, or at worse to outright and downright cheating. Therefore, in one way or another learners’
success becomes highly dependent on their ability to reproduce a fixed body of knowledge
(Schweisfurth, 2011). This has always been the main argument made in pedagogical terms against
the abuses of the teach-to-the-test approach at the expense of communication practices and highorder thinking skills. This question represents the fundamental paradox in English Language
Education in the sense that, “If schools largely test and award grades for factual recall, teachers
will, therefore, stress memorization and recall in their teaching, possibly at the expense of
communication skills and critical thinking that are vitally important for students to possess” (The
Glossary of Education Reform, 2013). Thus, the teach-to-the-test approach, as a teaching-testing
procedure, has become both ‘carrot and stick’, dictating respectively what teachers ought to teach
and what learners ought to learn.

3. Purpose of the Research
3.1. Pilot Experiment
This research paper closely relates to a pilot experimental study which is part of an overall language
research project, the Language and Culture Adjustment Programme, hosted by the ESP Teaching
Laboratory at the Algerian University of Tlemcen. Since its inception in 2016, the programme has
served a three-fold purpose: for one thing it aims to provide a linguistic support to students who
suffer from a serious lack at the level of the communicative skills drawing on the principles of a
communicatively-responsive pedagogy, for the other to help student whose knowledge about
Anglo-Saxon culture, namely British and American, falls short of the level demanded to adopt a
culturally-responsive pedagogy and thirdly, to invest in the rehabilitation of the ESP enterprise. In
short, the programme is intended for university students, regardless of their specialism, who wish
to develop their communicative abilities (communicative competence) and cultural competence in
English and in ESP training. The programme is collegially run and is imbued with a good sense of
teamwork. A group of EFL teachers and doctoral students offer those remedial courses on a regular
basis and whose efforts, hopefully, will be validated. The first objective of the Language and
Culture Adjustment Programme is our direct concern.
To limit the scope of the present research paper, no reference will be made to the culturallyresponsive pedagogy, and the term communicatively-responsive pedagogy will be used throughout
this article in its inclusive sense. It is hoped that it stands sufficiently following the different views
to be ambivalent and cover all aspects of the models relating to the concept of communicative
competence (Hymes, 1972; Canale & Swain, 1980, 1983; Bachman, 1990; Bachman & Palmer,
1996). Secondly, it is clear that an exhaustive survey of the different components of the
communicatively-responsive pedagogy, though they are of value to EFL students, would be well
beyond the scope of this research work.
3.2. Participants
Twenty-eight EFL students, representing our sample population, were selected for the pilot
experiment based on the results obtained in the English test in the Baccalaureate Examination (June
2018). Worth noting here is that the Algerian academic evaluation system follows the French
numerical scale moving from 0 to 20. The students scored reasonably well in the English test
(between 14/20 and 17/20). At this level, it should be noted that there is less need for pattern
control, as the foundations have been laid. The students demonstrated a good working knowledge
of the English language structures (usage); yet, unable to express themselves appropriately in terms
of some language functions (use), to use Widdowson’s (1978) dichotomy. In down-to-earth terms,
their communicative skills leave a lot to be desired.
3.3. Communicatively-Responsive Pedagogy
By way of introduction, it is worth noting that the term communicatively-responsive pedagogy is
used as an extension to Ladson-Billings’ (1994) term culturally-responsive teaching, i.e. the ability
to develop one’s cultural competence on a cross-cultural basis. In our very specific context,
communicatively-responsive pedagogy recognizes the importance of the language functions the
student will learn and the topics and notions he will learn to talk about.

3.4. Description of the Course
The communicatively-responsive pedagogy, as a course, tries a much as possible, to cover the four
language skills, as well as improving pronunciation and building vocabulary. Particular emphasis
is placed on listening and speaking as they represent the hallmark of any communicatively-oriented
pedagogy. The language used in the course is predominately British English, however, reference
is made whenever the difference between British English and American English is significant,
especially at the level of vocabulary. As a syllabus, the course links communicative functions to
topics through carefully graded grammatical structures that are needed for a basic level of
proficiency. In this way, there is a link between grammatical form and communicative function.
As for the map of the course, in very broad terms, it is divided into six units each of which
consists of three Parts. The units are preceded by a Pre-Unit Test (See Appendix B) and followed
by a Consolidation. The searching test, based on an assumed knowledge, is administrated to the
students before they embark on the unit properly. The test aims to assess much more the students’
communicative abilities before the course begins. It closely relates to the functions that
subsequently the teacher is to deal with in the Unit. The Parts are interrelated based on a synchronic
progression, and the consolidation closely relates to the language structures, words and expressions
to remember from the different parts.
3.5. Pre-Unit Test
At first sight, the activities in the Pre-Unit Test seem to be within the reach of an Algerian firstyear EFL student who has a fair knowledge of the English language. A student who spent seven
years of English Language Education, four years at the middle-school level and three years at the
secondary-school level, i.e., (B1) intermediate level on the Common European Framework of
References for Languages scale, (CEFR). A word of information is necessary here; the activities
in Appendix B were chosen randomly from the Pre-Unit Test. Through the different exercises, our
sample population was asked to perform specific language tasks:
•
•
•
•
•
•

To provide suitable conversational expressions for specific purposes (opening conversation
and expressing apologies).
To complete the missing parts of a conversation while focusing on some grammar points,
vocabulary, fixed conversational routines, and tag questions.
To supply information following a model provided in the instructions.
To read words (names of countries and their corresponding proper adjectives and
occupations) aloud with the correct pronunciation.
To behave linguistically in a socially appropriate way to the setting (formal/informal
language).
To correct language mistakes in sentences.

3.6. Correction
Two teachers, a doctoral student and a senior lecturer, were designated to correct (C1) and crosscorrect (C2) the Pre-Unit test in accordance with a pre-defined correction grid. The students’ exam
copies were corrected anonymously, substituting, therefore, the names of the students by letters in
a bid to avoid any subjective and biased evaluation (See Table 1). The marks were then compared
to the marks previously obtained in the Baccalaureate EFL exam. This clearly showed discrepant

results. Six overall language remarks were made concerning the test’s results. These remarks
reflected the students’ weaknesses at different language levels (each number referring to a specific
remark), and were formulated as follows (See Table 2):
1. Inability to differentiate between formal and informal discourse.
2. Inability to select appropriate conversational routines.
3. Inability to provide suitable expressions.
4. Inability to complete the sentences with the correct word.
5. Inability to choose the word/phrase to complete the sentence.
6. Inability to supply information following a model.

Table 1 shows that the two corrections (C1) and (C2) do not differ greatly in most cases. Thus, this
quasi-absence of significant differences between the assigned marks clearly indicates that the
teachers in charge of the correction followed rigorously the correction grid instruction.

Table 2 confirms our first research hypothesis; most first-year EFL students at the Algerian
University of Tlemcen, to some extent and by extension of our sample population, display serious
weaknesses at the level of language use. When asked to perform communicative functions, they
rely mostly on the Knowledge about Language (KAL) they have gained though an intensive
learning of the English language which has always drawn heavily upon the basic principles of the
teach-to-the-test approach. This is another way of saying that the marks obtained in the
Baccalaureate English exam, somehow, do not faithfully reflect the students’ real good command
of the English language. Consequently, a compensatory language adjustment imposes itself to
redress inefficiency in students’ communicative abilities to hopefully entrench quality in English
Language Education. This remedial work, an integral part of The Language and Culture
Adjustment Programme, comes to confirm our second research hypothesis.
3.7. Recommendations
Arguably, it is high time teachers should realize the very limits of examinations-oriented teaching
approaches on quality education, and account for the negative effects they yield on learning
achievement among EFL students at different levels. Learning a language is not a matter of
producing and reproducing, on the basis of a stimulus-response scheme, fixed bodies of knowledge

consisting of grammatical structures and lexicon for the purposes of scoring high and passing of
exams. A language, not least English as a global language, ought to be learned not only of as
systems of systems, phonological, grammatical, semantic, but also as a means of communication
embodying a set of competences: linguistic, communicative, pragmatic, and cultural.
Within the globalization framework, a good working knowledge of the English language has
become a sine qua non-condition to positively cope with the market demands and efficiently
respond to the requirements of the communications schemes of the 21st century. In this very
specific context, teachers and students should view the teaching-learning of the English language
from three different yet complementary perspectives:
1. The pedagogical perspective in which English is seen as an important subject of the school
curriculum, and, therefore, as an asset that can enrich the students’ exit profile.
2. The educational perspective in which English is viewed as a sign of a well-rounded
education.
3. The philosophical perspective in which English, as an international language, can help
increase cultural awareness and cross-cultural understanding, which in turn help to promote
international understanding, and ultimately develop the sense of tolerance vis-à-vis others’
differences.
4.
However, these cannot be achieved without first and foremost a teaching-learning of English which
moves beyond exam-oriented instructional models of English Language Education.
Conclusion
This research paper is a report of a pilot experiment on the negative effects of the exam-centric
education system, not least in English Language Education classrooms, on students communicative
abilities. As teachers of English, we have always complained about this ‘unhealthy’ and ‘unethical’
and counter-productive system which has led to the proliferation of a type of teaching drawing
extensively on the teach-to-the test principles. The immediate goal and the principle motivating
drive for students are, therefore, to pass exams. We have always believed, and our experiment
supports our opinion, that this shift in interest would lead to the emergence of successful learners
on ‘Exam English’ seats but ineffective and very incompetent ‘English users’ in real-life context.
What is more, a discrete-item oriented teaching and the teach-to-the-test approach make a
perfect marriage. The memorization of the grammar rules and the application of the deductive
processing to the various English language tests are vivid illustrations of a harmonious union. Thus,
by analogy with what was said more than fifty years ago by Rivers (1968), we can confirm that
many a student well-taught Exam English and well-trained in exam-technique preparation will find
himself at a loss in conducting a conversation with a native speaker of English. Such a student may
be perfectly at home with the grammar of English and its meta-language, yet find his ears assailed
by unfamiliar phrases as soon as he hears two Britons or Americans in a discussion. He may be
able to talk fluently and prescriptively about tenses and prepositions, conditionals and the like, but
unable to greet, introduce, begin conversations with strangers and foreigners or say goodbye
according to the rules of speaking, to borrow Hymes’ (1972) term. This is another way of saying
that the teach-to-the test, the incarnation of an exam-centric education system par excellence, not

only does harm to the communicative abilities of EFL learners but in the long run to the promotion
of lifelong English Language Education as well. However, in this very specific context, the
equation between teaching and testing becomes more complex.
