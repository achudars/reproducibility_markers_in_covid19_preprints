Abstract
We use high-resolution satellite data to determine how Amazonian deforestation
changes discretely at the Brazilian international border. We document two dramatic
reversals. In 2000, Brazilian pixels were 37 percent more likely to be deforested, and
between 2001 and 2005 annual Brazilian deforestation was more than three times
the rate observed across the border. In 2006, just after Brazil introduced policies
to reduce deforestation, these differences disappear. However, from 2014, amid a
period of economic crisis and deteriorating commitment to environmental regulation, Brazilian deforestation rates jump back up to near pre-reform levels. These
results demonstrate the power of the state to affect whether wilderness ecosystems
are conserved or exploited.

Introduction

This paper explores the degree to which national policies can exert regulatory control over
conservation by examining whether there are discrete changes in deforestation at national
borders. Because political and hence policy jurisdictions stop at the national border – but
satellite data on conservation outcomes can be measured uniformly across the geography
– by analyzing satellite data on deforestation at the international border we can precisely
isolate the effect of national policies, holding constant the underlying geography.
We do so in the context of one of the most important global ecosystems: the Amazon
rainforest. Covering more than two million square miles – about the size of the contiguous United States west of the Mississippi River – the Amazon plays a crucial role
in the global carbon cycle and hosts an astounding amount of biological diversity. The
Amazon is a global public good – its immense size implies that the rate at which it is
deforested will affect the pace of global warming (IPBES, 2018). Hence understanding
whether conservation efforts by Amazonian nation states are effective is an issue of international importance. Indeed if these national policies have no de facto bite then this
renders ineffective both national and international accords to slow Amazonian deforestation (Fearnside, 2012).
To study the impact of national policy in the Amazon, we use newly-updated annual
30-meter resolution Landsat 7 data which allows us to monitor deforestation in a consistent manner over time and space from 2000 to 2018 (Hansen et al., 2013). The high
resolution allows us to zoom in close to the border to identify precise effects – our preferred
specification uses a bandwidth of only 25km on either side of the national border. We
show that areas on both sides of the border look similar in most important geographic
respects, such as slope and distances to urban areas, water, and roads. This is to be
expected given that historical borders were drawn with little regard to local institutions
and with limited knowledge of the underlying geographies. While our focus is on results
analyzing the entire 12,800km Brazilian border in the Amazon, we perform a robustness
exercise restricting attention to “artificial borders” – i.e., typically straight lines drawn in
unknown territory by former colonizers and which do not correspond to any preexisting
natural or institutional border (Alesina et al., 2011).
We investigate the role of national regulation of deforestation by running spatial regression discontinuity designs, using as running variable the distance to the Brazilian
national border. This paper therefore fits within a rich literature using borders to look at
policy effects.1 We document five striking facts. First, we show that up until about 2005,
the level and rate of deforestation was dramatically higher on the Brazilian side of the
1

While borders have been shown to be associated with policy outcomes in developed countries (Black,
1999; Holmes, 1998; Turner et al., 2014) where regulations are tightly enforced, the evidence in developing
countries is more mixed (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2014; Pinkovskiy, 2017).

border than in its neighbors. This was associated with Brazilian policies to develop the
Amazon. When our data starts in 2000, Brazilian land was 37 percent more likely to be
have been deforested than similar lands located just a few kilometers away across the border. From 2001 to 2005, the annual deforestation rate was more than three times higher
on the Brazilian side of the border than in neighboring countries. These differences are
similar across the borders with both Bolivia and Peru – the two border segments where
the so-called “Arc of Deforestation” intersects the international border – indicating that
the differences are due to policies in Brazil, rather in countries across the border.
Second, we show that the discontinuity in deforestation rates disappears precipitously
in 2006 – just as Brazil was implementing substantially tougher national policies targeting
illegal deforestation. In November 2004, Brazil launched the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) which strengthened
the legal penalties associated with illegal deforestation, particularly on unclaimed and private land outside protected areas (Nepstad et al., 2009). PPCDAm was bolstered in 2006
by the Law on Public Forest Management, and by the Center for Environmental Monitoring becoming fully operational, which together enabled the Brazilian state to couple
satellite-based detection of deforestation with police and army enforcement operations
targeted at areas where illegal deforestation had been detected (MMA, 2008).
Third, we document that the positive impacts of the Brazilian forest policy were
relatively short-lived. Starting in 2014, deforestation rates in Brazil have started to return
to near pre-2004 levels. Again, we find discontinuously higher deforestation that goes right
up to the international border but not across it, which suggests that these changes were
caused by Brazilian policies. This second reversal coincides with a period of economic
crisis and lowered commitment to environmental regulation with many of the regulatory
changes brought in by PPCDAm being undone (Ferreira et al., 2014). Most notably, the
New Forest Code enacted in late 2012, and disputed in the Supreme Court until 2018,
set an amnesty for “small” properties that had deforested Legal Reserve areas before
2008 – in practice, forgiving 90 percent of the rural properties in the area for engaging in
crimes of illegal deforestation (Soares-Filho et al., 2014). This reversal is consistent with
the hypothesis that environmental protection was weakened and reversed under political
pressure (Fearnside, 2016; Azevedo et al., 2017; Freitas et al., 2018; Soterroni et al., 2018).
Newly released satellite data therefore allows us to document this widespread reversal
across the Brazilian Amazon, and in particular, our border analysis shows that this is a
uniquely Brazilian phenomenon. This is concrete evidence that the Brazilian state is now
favoring exploitation over conservation.
Fourth, we show that de jure land use restrictions on the Brazilian side matter – even
at the border. We find that areas designated as protected areas in Brazil have always
been less deforested than unprotected lands just on the opposite side of the international

2

border, and this remains the case from 2006 onward. The Brazilian state was therefore
able to enforce environmental regulations when there was the political will to do so even in
these outlying areas. Instead, reductions in deforestation following the mid-2000s policy
changes in Brazil were most pronounced on unclaimed and private lands outside protected
areas – precisely the types of lands where the increase in enforcement by the Brazilian
state was most pronounced (Appendix B.3).
Fifth, we find that the Brazilian effort to cope with illegal deforestation was effective
to reduce forest loss exactly in those areas closer to economic activity, at least initially.
We further document that while the effects of Brazilian deforestation policy started to
weaken first in areas further from enforcement bases (in the middle tercile of distance,
between 560-880km away from enforcement centers), by 2015 the impact of Brazilian
deforestation policies was severely undermined even in areas closer to law enforcement.
In sum, in the first reversal Brazilian effort to cope with illegal deforestation was effective
in reducing forest loss exactly in those areas closer to economic and market pressure and to
law enforcement bases. However, as the policy position towards environmental regulation
shifted in Brazil it was precisely these areas that experienced accelerated deforestation
during the second reversal.
Combined, these results – the sharp discontinuity in deforestation levels and rates
at the border, the dramatic change in deforestation at the border when then national
government cracked down, the fact that protected areas in Brazil were always less likely
to be deforested than corresponding lands just across the national border, and the reversal
of deforestation rates exactly in the areas where environmental policies were previously
highly enforced – demonstrate the remarkable reach of the Brazilian state to exploit or
conserve its natural resources. They suggest that the rapid deforestation in the Brazilian
Amazon in the early 2000s was a consequence of a pro-exploitation policy environment.
This policy stance was sharply reversed in the 2006-2013 period with laws to protect the
Amazon rainforest being introduced and enforced. This position stalled and reversed in
the post-2013 period during a period when political and economic crisis collided with a
weakening of forest conservation laws.
Our results help to understand why the Brazilian Amazon was the only major area
of tropical forest that has experienced falling rates of deforestation since the mid-2000s
(Figure 1), and why this downward trend has reversed during the past few years. Brazil
– which contains 65 percent of the Amazon rainforest – moves from having almost the
highest rate of deforestation in 2001 to having the lowest rate in 2013, with the trend
reversal occurring in the mid-2000s (see, e.g., Nepstad et al., 2009; Nolte et al., 2013;
Godar et al., 2014). In strict contrast Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
the non-Brazilian Amazon (which contain the bulk of the remaining tropical forest) experience rising deforestation rates across the 2001-2018 period. Identifying the role of

3

Brazilian government policies in causing this decline in deforestation – and its subsequent
increase – is challenging as these policies were applied throughout the country. The same
challenge applies to understanding why this trend reversed from 2014 onwards.2 By zooming in on the national border, where Brazil’s policy reach ends, we can precisely identify
the limits and impacts of being in Brazil and under the Brazilian policy regime.3 The
methods employed here therefore may be usefully employed by governments concerned
with wilderness conservation in other contexts.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets our empirical
specification and discusses our data. We present results in Section 3. Section 4 concludes.

Empirical methods and data

2.1

Empirical specification

Our empirical analysis takes place at the 120-meter pixel resolution level.4 Our running
variable is distance to the border. Positive distances represent pixels in the Brazilian
Amazon, while negative distances represent pixels in the Amazon outside Brazil.
Our main estimating equation is
Yi = α + γBrazili + f (DistBorderi ) + δXi + εi

(1)

where Yi is the outcome of interest (forest cover in 2000 or forest loss in a given year)
in pixel i. Brazili is a dummy equal to one if pixel i is in Brazil. f (DistBorderi ) =
Brazili ∗f Brazil (DistBorderi )+(1−Brazili )∗f OutsideBrazil (DistBorderi ) is a polynomial
of distance from the border, separately on each side of the border. Following Gelman and
Imbens (2019), we use separate linear polynomials f on each side of the border for our
preferred specification, and use separate quadratic polynomials as robustness. Xi is a
vector of controls explained below. We cluster standard errors in blocks of size 25km by
25km to allow for geographical spatial error correlation.5
The coefficient of interest is γ, which measures the difference in the share of a pixel
2

Several papers use variation across Brazilian municipalities for identification. Assunção et al. (2013)
compare areas with more or less cloud cover to argue that satellite-based enforcement contributed to
reductions in deforestation, Assunção et al. (2015) compare municipalities with greater or lower “tightness
of land constraints” for farmers and Godar et al. (2014) shows that the decline in deforestation is larger
in census tracts dominated by large landholders.
3
A related literature studies how regulation and infrastructure affect deforestation (e.g., Adman, 2014;
Souza-Rodrigues, 2018; Anderson et al., 2016; Asher et al., 2017) and violence in the Amazon (e.g.,
Chimeli and Soares, 2017).
4
We aggregate from the 30-meter to 120-meter level to ease computational constraints.
5
Conley (1999) standard errors would be an alternative but is computationally challenging due to
the extremely large number of observations. Our OLS results show bias-corrected confidence intervals
(Calonico et al., 2014).

that is forested in 2000, or deforested in a given year after 2000, on the Brazilian side of
the border compared to the other side. We estimate equation (1) by OLS in our main
specifications. When we perform exercises to assess if there is heterogeneity in institutional
effects across different segments of the border and land types within Brazil, we estimate
equation (1) using a Poisson model with cluster-robust standard errors clustered at the
same 25km by 25km blocks.6 We do this because there are substantial differences in
baseline magnitudes of deforestation across the Amazon across land types, and Poisson
estimates remain interpretable as percent changes across land types.7
Our identifying assumption is that other factors that might affect deforestation change
smoothly across national borders. If this assumption is valid, by controlling for a polynomial in distance from the border, we remove additional sources of biases and allow for
causal inference. The idea that the borders are largely arbitrary is consistent with the
historical evidence - they were largely set by the 1750 Treaty of Madrid (see Appendix
B.3.4) when many of these areas deep in the jungle were largely unexplored and appeared
as blank spaces labeled “unknown country” in maps from that time (Furtado, 2012).
To explore this assumption in the data, we check for discontinuities at the border
on four factors that may influence deforestation: slope, distance to water, distance to
urban areas, and distance to roads. Appendix Table A2 shows the estimates of γ which
represent the discontinuous change in the level of these variables at the Brazilian border,
for various subsets of the border and bandwidths. Overall, columns 1, 4, 7, and 10
show that that these factors are smoothly distributed around the Brazilian border (the
remaining columns are for robustness subsamples we discuss in more detail in Section 3.1).
Nonetheless, in our main specification we estimate (1) controlling for natural covariates:
land, slope, and distance from water. We present results both without any controls and
including additional controls for distance to infrastructure in the robustness tables.
We report results using bandwidths around the border ranging from 11km to 100km.
Since we have several dependent variables, we do not have a single theory-driven optimal bandwidth. We calculate the optimal bandwidth for each dependent variable as in
Calonico et al. (2014) and in Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). To ease comparability
across equations, our preferred bandwidth is the average of the optimal bandwidths calculated across all variables using Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) method, which is 25
km from the border. We also present results using Calonico et al. (2014) method, which
is 11 km from the border. In our preferred specification using all 120m pixels within 25
km of the border, we have 1,094 clusters and 31,071,838 observations each year.
6

Since each 120m pixel is comprised of sixteen 30-meter pixels, our dependent variable is effectively a
count variable with range [0,16].
7
While we present OLS results in our main specifications for ease of interpretation, Poisson results
are qualitatively very similar. See Appendix Table A5, column 3, and note that that Poisson results are
interpretable as percent changes in the dependent variable.

2.2

Data

Hansen et al. (2013) worked with Google Earth Engine to detect deforestation using Landsat 7 data, resulting in a map of global forest cover in 2000 and consistent longitudinal
annual forest measures. We use the latest version of this data, which has annual deforestation measures from 2001 to 2018, at a spatial resolution of 30 meters across the whole
earth. The forest cover map is constructed for 2000 because Landsat 7 was launched in
the previous year, so Hansen uses it as the base cover on which he constructs annual
forest loss. Importantly, since this dataset is worldwide and does not use any national
data as inputs, we can examine deforestation rates on both sides of the border using an
exactly comparable metric. We aggregate pixels to create a resolution of 120×120 meters
to facilitate computations. Annual forest loss is defined as the share of 30m Landsat pixels
within our 120m pixels deforested within one year. Forest cover in 2000 is the average
tree cover canopy of the Landsat pixels. Summary statistics are shown in Appendix Table
A1.
We limit our analysis to the Amazon area as defined by RAISG (La Red Amazónica
de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada), taking into account the biome and the
legal Amazon limits as defined by the various countries in the region. On net, we have
more than 277 million observations in the Amazon each year.
Figure 2 shows an example of the data, displaying forest cover as of 2000. Panel (a)
shows the entire Amazon, and Panel (b) zooms in on one particular border segment, which
consists largely of straight lines. The substantially higher deforestation on the Brazilian
(right-hand) side of the border is visible.
We supplement this deforestation data with a variety of other data sources. Hydrology
data from 2000 was extracted from Google Earth Engine. Remaining data including
administrative boundaries, protected areas, elevation, slope, waterways, roads and urban
areas were extracted from OpenStreetMap’s API.

Results
Deforestation as of 2000

We begin by examining the level of forest cover in 2000, the year our data begins. Figure
3 shows the percentage of forest cover in the year 2000 averaged by eighty equal-sized
bins of distances from the Brazilian border, up to one hundred kilometers from each side
of the border. The sharp discontinuity in deforestation is visually apparent: forest cover
drops sharply exactly at the national border.
Our regression estimates using equation (1) indicate that this discontinuous change in
forest cover at the border is sizable and statistically significant. Using a 25km bandwidth,
6

forest cover in the Brazilian Amazon was around 3.9 percentage points smaller than in its
neighboring countries (cluster-robust p-value equal to 0.069; see Appendix Table A3).8
Since 89.4 percent of the land outside of Brazil was forested in 2000, this implies that
deforestation prior to 2000 was 37 percent higher just inside the Brazilian border relative
to on the other side.

3.2

The Double Reversal of Fortune – Annual forest loss at the
border

We next plot annual deforestation rates on both sides of the border between 2001 and 2018
in Figure 4. The figures show a dramatic difference in deforestation rates in 2001-2005
that come to an abrupt halt in 2006. This is the first reversal we observe. Between 2006
and 2013, deforestation activity is spread smoothly on both sides of the Brazilian border.
The change in 2006 comes from decreased deforestation in Brazil, rather than increased
deforestation on the other side of the border. Deforestation rates in 2014-2018 return to
close to the levels seen in the early-2000’s, mostly driven by an increase in deforestation
activity in Brazil.
We estimate RD models separately for each year. Figure 5a plots the RD coefficient –
γ in equation (1) – from each year, along with 95 percent confidence intervals, using OLS
regressions and a 25km bandwidth. We estimate annual deforestation rates of about 0.2
percentage points higher per year on the Brazilian side of the border through 2004. Since
deforestation on the other side of the border ranged from 0.05 to 0.07 percent in other
Amazonian countries, the estimates imply deforestation rates in Brazil were 3-4 times
faster than on the other side of the border.
The dramatic changes we observe at the border correspond to policy changes in Brazil.9
First, the precipitous decline in deforestation at the border in the mid-2000s corresponds
to a period of environmental policy strengthening in Brazil (Appendix B.1). This followed the appointment in 2003 of Marina Silva as Minister of Environment in the Lula
government who was from the Amazon region and had a strong predilection towards conserving the rainforest. Although the comprehensive PPCDAm plan, which she helped
craft, was released in 2004, its actions were implemented gradually: most notably with
the Law on Public Forest Management and Center for Environmental Monitoring becoming fully operational in 2006. This allowed the satellite-based deforestation detection
system (DETER) to become a key tool for targeting law enforcement activities in the
Brazilian Amazon, including sending in federal police and troops to arrest illegal loggers
and confiscate their machinery (MMA, 2008). Consonant with this, Figure 4 shows that
8

Results vary from 2.8 percentage points to 5.6 percentage points, depending on bandwidth, which we
vary from 11km to 100 km. Estimates with alternate bandwidths are shown in Appendix Table A3.

Appendix B.2 provides a summary of the main policies in Brazil and neighboring countries.

in 2006 deforestation on the Brazilian side of the border collapses and the discontinuity
at the border is eliminated. Taken together, these results point to an important role for
Brazilian policy in determining deforestation rates at the border.10
Figure 4, however, also shows that the deforestation rate on the Brazilian side of the
border resumes growing in 2014. This is the second reversal we observe. Increased deforestation in Brazil is associated with a lowered commitment to environmental regulation.
In particular the new Government of Dilma Rousseff introduced a New Forest Code in
2012, which gave an amnesty to those who had engaged in illegal deforestation before
2008. Though contested in the courts (and finally ratified by the Supreme Court in 2018)
this introduced considerable uncertainty as to whether illegal deforestation was a crime.
Brazilian environmental governance was undermined over the years since 2012 by the
growing political power of the agriculture producers, consecutive weak governments and
scarce public resources (see Appendix B.1).11
Furthermore, 2014 was a particularly turbulent year for the federal government. With
elections at the end of the year, the economy started giving signs of a long-lasting economic crisis, and a major corruption scandal erupted involving key politicians from the
administration. The upshot of this political and economic crises was that by 2016, the
budget of the Brazilian Environmental Agency (IBAMA) was only 57 percent of its budget
in 2013 (see Appendix B). The protection environment further deteriorated when Michel
Temer, the next president, signed a law that streamlined the titling of occupied public
lands, which may have further encouraged land grabs in the Amazon. After three years of
political and economic crisis, in 2017, we see that deforestation was about 0.17 percentage
points higher at the Brazilian border (cluster-robust p-value equal to 0.015).12
Newly released satellite data therefore allows us to document this widespread reversal
across the Brazilian Amazon, and in particular, our border analysis shows that this is a
uniquely Brazilian phenomenon. We observe Brazilian deforestation rates (2014-2018) in
recent years in Brazil reverting to pre-reform (2001-2005) levels thereby negating eight
years of policy reforms (2006-2013) dedicated to slowing the rate of deforestation in the
Brazilian Amazon (5a). Given that the Amazon accounts for 40 percent of tropical forests
– and Brazil for the bulk of it – this is a troubling finding. Our analysis suggest that the
10

An alternative explanation for the precipitous change we observe in 2006 is a differential change in
output prices. To investigate this, we obtained national domestic farmgate prices for soybeans, the main
crop in these regions, for both Brazil and Bolivia (the border country closest to the Brazilian agricultural
frontier), from the FAO (consistent data on cattle prices are not available). As shown in Appendix
Figure A6, farmgate prices move almost directly in parallel in both countries through 2011, and there is
no differential break in prices around 2006.

See, e.g., Tollefson (2016); Fearnside (2016); Viola and Franchini (2017); Crouzeilles et al. (2017);
Rochedo et al. (2018); Freitas et al. (2018); Soterroni et al. (2018); Tollefson (2018).
12
Point estimates are statistically significant in all other specifications – using different sets of controls,
quadratic polynomial and excluding Mount Roraima (Tables A4), using rectangular kernel, or estimating
using Poisson model (Table A5), or using 50 and 100km bandwidths (Table A3). The only exception is
when using 11km bandwidth, OLS estimation and triangular kernel (when cluster-robust p-value is equal
to 0.16).

8

recent reversal is due to political and economic crises colliding with a weakening of forest
conservation laws in Brazil (Soares-Filho et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2014; Fearnside, 2016;
Azevedo et al., 2017; Freitas et al., 2018; Soterroni et al., 2018).
These results are robust to a series of alternative specifications and samples. Our
baseline RD specifications use OLS and control for slope and distance to water, use linear
polynomials, and are estimated using the entire Brazilian border. Appendix Tables A4
and A5 show that the results are qualitatively similar if we: a) do not include the slope
and distance to water controls; b) add additional infrastructure controls; c) estimate using
Poisson models; d) use quadratic polynomials; and e) exclude a 220km buffer around the
peak of Mount Roraima, a small section of the northern border with Venezuela, which
is coincident with a mountain ridge and the only part of the border where there are
differences in slope at the border.
We also estimate results restricting the sample to areas around artificial borders, as in
Alesina et al. (2011) – i.e., borders arbitrarily drawn by former colonizers which appear
as straight lines on a map (Appendix B.3.4).13 For these borders, there is no geographic
feature at the border – and indeed, usually not even so much as a fence.14 These areas
correspond to 10 percent of our sample, so our standard errors are correspondingly larger.
Nevertheless, we find even larger effects during the period of deforestation slowdown, as
shown in Figure A1 (see Appendix Table A5). We do not observe a statistically significant
ramp up post-2014 in deforestation in this subsample, though we cannot reject statistically
the effects of the magnitude we see in our full analysis sample.

3.3

Are these differences about Brazil?

An important question is whether the differences we observe at the border reflect differences in the policy environment within Brazil, as opposed to changes happening on the
other side of the border. Examining Figure 4 suggests prima facie that they are about
changes in Brazil – the deforestation rates on the non-Brazil side of the border are remarkably similar from year to year, whereas the two reversals we document are all due
to changes (first decreases, then increases) on the Brazilian side of the border. The only
time we see major changes outside of Brazil is 2016, when deforestation outside Brazil
appears to increase – but deforestation increases even more on the Brazilian side of the
border, as shown in the discontinuity estimates.
Nevertheless, to explore this issue in more detail, we further investigate heterogeneity
in effects by land type within Brazil, and heterogeneity based on what country is on the
13

We map the segments of artificial border in Figure A7b in the appendix.
In fact, in one famous incident, President-elect Cardoso of Brazil went hiking near the border in 1994,
and accidentally ended up in Bolivia – and was there for over an hour before anyone realized he was in
the wrong country (Cardoso and Winter, 2006, pp. 218-219).

other side of the border.
3.3.1

Heterogeneity by land classification within Brazil

We begin by examining heterogeneity in effects based on the land use classification of
different areas within Brazil. Land in the Brazilian Amazon is divided into areas that
are protected for conservation and other reasons (e.g., national parks), areas which are
untitled and unclaimed and areas which are under private ownership. Since 1998, harming
native vegetation in Protected Areas (PAs) was a felony subject to potentially harsh legal
procedures and punishments – including possible jail time. This category of land thus
faced the highest level of de jure sanction throughout the 2000-2018 period. In contrast,
PPCDAm made several changes that increased enforcement outside PAs.
Most notably, until 2005, deforesting untitled, or unclaimed land, outside PAs was just
an infraction, punishable at most with fines, and individuals caught harming native vegetation or extracting resources in these lands would not even have their equipment seized.
PPCDAm, which was fully implemented in 2006 when real-time satellite data became
available for enforcement, made deforestation of unclaimed land a felony punishable with
jail time, as in PAs, and legislated that equipment (i.e., trucks and chainsaws) of violators
could be seized and confiscated.
Similarly until 2005, private properties outside PAs were required to set aside at least
35 percent of their area as native vegetation – i.e., it was illegal to deforest more than 65
percent of the private property area. Non-compliance with this threshold, however, was
just an infraction. Starting in 2005, PPCDAm both increased the required set-aside area
of private properties from 35 to 80 percent15 and conditioned access to agricultural credit
lines from public banks on environmental compliance (Assunção et al., 2013).
To explore whether differences in de jure enforcement regimes translated into differences in de facto deforestation at the border, we re-estimate equation (1) separately for
each of these three classes of land. Figure 5b presents the results, where every point is an
estimated RD coefficient (i.e., γ from (1)) from a separate Poisson regression using 25km
bandwidths.
We see that when the national border abuts Brazilian PAs we observe less deforestation on the Brazilian side consistent with these areas enjoying greater de jure protection
throughout our whole period. In strict contrast, for unclaimed lands we observe more
deforestation on the Brazilian side up until 2005, but this discontinuity is eliminated from
2006 when PPCDAm comes into full force. For private lands, while there is a dramatic
fall in the difference in deforestation rates in 2006, it is not eliminated entirely, consistent
with the fact that some deforestation was still allowed in these areas. These results con15

Pre-2005 infringements were not prosecuted but landowners were liable for any deforestation above
the 20 percent requirement from 2005 onward.

firm that – even in these remote areas very close to the international border – differences
in deforestation map to changes in land use regulations within Brazil.
3.3.2

Heterogeneity by bordering country

The border discontinuity our identification strategy exploits captures the net policy difference at the border. Although Figure 4 suggests that most of the effects we document
come from decreased, and subsequently increased, deforestation on the Brazilian side of
the border, our estimates could be influenced by changes in the environmental policies
in other countries in the Amazon region. We did not identify any crucial land use and
deforestation policy changes in neighboring countries to Brazil that could undermine our
interpretation of the estimates.16
Nonetheless, we next investigate whether the effects we see are homogeneous across all
country border segments by re-estimating equation (1) separately for the border segment
with each country. Figure A3 presents the results, analogous to Figure 5b. Our estimated
effects are almost identical when comparing the Brazilian border with Bolivia with the
Brazilian border with Peru, the two countries where the so-called “Arc of Deforestation”–
i.e., where deforestation rates are highest – intersects the international border.
We find no statistically meaningful differential deforestation in the whole period for
the more remote areas bordering Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French
Guiana (see Figure A3b), though the point estimates suggest higher deforestation in Brazil
along the Venezuelan border and the Northern border with Guyana, Suriname and French
Guiana during the early part of our sample. It is important to note, however, that there
is very little deforestation on either side of the border in these very remote locations. For
example, while the annual deforestation rate in Brazil in 2001 near the Bolivian border is
1.14 percent, it ranges between only 0.02 and 0.05 percent on all other country borders.
Thus, in the segment of the international border where deforestation is substantial, the
fact that we find nearly identical effects of being in Brazil suggests that the effects are
about Brazilian policy, rather than policies in the countries on the other side of the border.

3.4

Heterogeneity by distance from markets and enforcement

To the extent the effects we document are driven by the interplay between demand for
deforestation and enforcement, we should expect to find heterogeneity in effects along
both these dimensions. We therefore investigate heterogeneity in effects based on markets
access and enforcement. First, we look at heterogeneous effects by distance to roads as
a proxy for market access and transportation cost. We estimate equation (1) separately
for the pixels in each tercile of the distribution of distance to roads. The solid line in
16

Appendix B.2 provides a summary of the main policies in Brazil and neighboring countries.

11

Figure A4a shows the estimates for pixels within 15km to roads (the 33rd percentile), the
dashed line shows pixels between 15 and 50km to roads (the 66th percentile) and the red
line shows pixels further than 50km from roads. We see that all differential deforestation
comes from the third of pixels closer to roads. We find no clear pattern of differential
deforestation rates in pixels more than 50km away from roads.
Second, we use distance to towns or villages to capture proximity to local markets.
Similar to heterogeneity by roads, Figure A4b shows larger effects in pixels closer to
villages. This is consistent with changes in deforestation being more pronounced where
pressures for extraction are greatest.
Last, we look at heterogeneous effects by distance to the 10 enforcement bases from
the Brazilian Environmental Agency (IBAMA). Given the size of the Amazon, we see that
one third of pixels around the national border are within 565km from an enforcement base,
and one third of pixels are more than 880km away from an enforcement bases. Figure
A5 shows the estimates for pixels within each of tercile of distance to enforcement. The
results in Figure A5 suggest that the double reversal of fortune happened in areas closer
to IBAMA enforcement bases. The solid line shows that PPCDAm’s largest reduction
in annual deforestation rate happened until 2009 in the areas closest to enforcement –
within 565km. Likewise, the dark lines show that the effect of Brazilian deforestation
policy started to weaken around 2013 in areas closer to enforcement, with deforestation
rates being higher on the Brazilian side since then. The red dashed line shows smaller
annual deforestation rates on the Brazilian side of the border in more remote pixels,
further than 880km away from enforcement bases, in the whole period.
In sum, in the first reversal Brazilian effort to cope with illegal deforestation was effective in reducing forest loss exactly in those areas closer to economic and market pressure
and to law enforcement bases. However, as the policy position towards environmental
regulation shifted in Brazil it was precisely these areas that experienced accelerated deforestation during the second reversal. This analysis thus underlines the extent to which
rates of deforestation in Brazil depended on enforcement of national policies.

Conclusion

By using fine grained satellite data we are able to test whether Brazilian conservation
policies had any bite at the national border. This is an interesting exercise as there has
been considerable skepticism regarding the ability of the state to exercise control over
global ecosystems. In effect, the ability of the state to conserve ecosystems may fall as
locations become remote, which opens up opportunities for those who want to illegally
extract resources. Given that rapid environmental degradation in developing countries is
being driven by illegal extraction it is important to empirically assess whether or not the
12

state has the power to conserve natural resources in these remote locations.
This is the contribution of this paper. We observe sharp discontinuities in forest loss
at the border, a diminution in these as Brazil implemented policies to detect and penalize
illegal logging, but then document a second reversal once Brazilian enforcement slackens.
Our results therefore demonstrate the power of the state to determine whether wilderness
ecosystems are conserved or exploited. Moreover, the pattern of diminution within Brazil,
where post-2005 deforestation rates fall mainly in non-protected areas but increase amid
legal and political uncertainty post-2013, again points to the influence of national policies
on conservation.
This finding has implications beyond Brazil. The future path of the earth’s climate
will, to some significant extent, be determined by whether vast wilderness ecosystems
like the Amazon can be kept intact. The fact that Brazil moves from having almost the
highest rate of deforestation in 2001 to having the lowest rate less than a decade later is
testament to how conservation policy can be turned around. Part of this turnaround was
achieved by the Brazilian state coupling better monitoring (through use of satellite data)
with more stringent enforcement (through the use of federal police). The growing rise
in deforestation rate experienced by Brazil from 2014 onwards, however, points to how
quickly such policies can unravel when political backing for national and international
conservation efforts evaporates. Indeed, Brazil has moved from congruence to dissonance
as regards to international efforts to slow climate change by slowing tropical deforestation.
The success of wilderness conservation, therefore, ultimately depends on the policy
choices of national governments. Information on illegal logging, for example, is regularly
available to any government at a 30-meter resolution (Hansen et al., 2013). Whether or
not governments act on this information is another matter and depends largely on the
political willingness to do so. Nevertheless, the remarkable reversal we document in Brazil
suggests that it is possible to reduce the gap between de jure and de facto conservation
policy, even in wilderness areas in developing countries. This is an important proof of
concept for other countries considering strengthening their conservation efforts.
The transitory nature of the gains in Brazil, however, underlie how difficult it is to
maintain a pro-conservation equilibrium when there are short term economic gains to be
had from exploiting natural resources. More research is needed to understand how the
incentives of government’s intent on promoting growth and development can be brought
in line with longer-term conservation objectives.

Column 1 uses a triangular kernel, other columns use rectangular kernel. Columns 3 and 4 use a Poisson model instead
of OLS. Units of observations are 120-meter pixels. Standard errors clustered at 25km grids in parentheses. Number
of observations: 1,094 and 31,071,838 (columns 2 and 3), 129 and 3,134,194 (columns 1 and 4). Significance levels:

migration influx. Migrants could work as rubber tappers, but could not own land.
1904

Brazil gains control of Acre state, in the border with Bolivia and Peru. Last borders
defined in Treaty of Rio de Janeiro in1909.

1940-1945 Second Rubber Cycle (coincides with WWII). President Getulio Vargas promotes
the “March to the West” and advertises the “New Eldorado”.
1964-1980s Military Dictatorship promoted the occupation of the area.
1976

Regularization of land titling for properties under 60 thousand hectares that were
occupied illegally but in “good faith”.

1978

Population in the Legal Amazon 7 million people.

1980s

Environmental concerns start to emerge and the main local environmental leader,
Chico Mendes, is murdered in 1988.

1990s

New large population influx with cattle ranching and soybean plantations expansion.

2000

Population in the Legal Amazon 21 million people.

2002

The Amazon Protected Area Program (ARPA) is created to expand the Brazilian
National System of Protected Areas (SNUC) and to guarantee financial resources
to promote sustainable development (Federal Decree 4.326/2002).
Creation of Ecological and Economic Zoning, EEZ, (Federal Decree 4297/2002).

2003

The first presidential mandate of Lula da Silva begins. Marina Silva is appointed
Minister of the Environment.
The rural caucus in congress (the “ruralists”) win 73 seats (14% of the congress).

2004
17

In November, the Ministry of Environment launches the first phase of PPCDAm.17

The first phase was originally planned to be implemented from April 2003.

19

2004-08

Demarcation of the perimeter of new Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands;
both are Protected Areas.18
Banning of over 60,000 illegal rural property titles.
Development of the remote-sensing system DETER by INPE.

2005

Demarcation of Conservation Units in the areas surrounding the highways BR-319
(Manaus – Porto Velho) and BR-163 (Tenente Portela – Santarém).19

Background
Environmental Regulation in the Brazilian Amazon

Until the 1960s, the Brazilian Amazon’s native vegetation was largely preserved and inhospitable, popularly known as the “Green Hell” (Inferno Verde). The area had a small and
sparse population living at subsistence levels, primarily involved in the extraction of rubber, as
well as an indigenous population. Between 1964 and 1985, the military government promoted
the occupation of the region by non-indigenous people with large infrastructure construction
projects – e.g., by building roads and hydroelectric power plants – and by promoting the titling
of occupied productive land (Pfaff, 1999). Consequently, a substantial number of migrants
moved to the Amazon area, creating a boom of cattle ranching in the region.
Environmental consequences were not a central concern of Brazil during this period. Indeed,
the Ministry of Environment (MMA) was created only in 1985, and the Brazilian Environmental
Protection Agency (IBAMA) only in 1989. Even after the creation of IBAMA, and despite
the enactment of the first Environmental Crimes Act in 1998, penalties for deforestation and
squatting on unclaimed land were weak, and there was little coordination among federal agencies
attempting to enforce these laws. On net, between the 1980s and 2004, the deforested area
grew from 6% to 16% of total forest land in the Brazilian Amazon (MMA, 2013).
B.3.2

The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the
Legal Amazon (PPCDAm)

The government of president Lula da Silva brought a new light to the environmental agenda
in 2003, with the appointment of Marina Silva as Minister of the Environment. In 2004,
the Brazilian federal government launched the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of
Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) to crack down on deforestation in the Amazon.
PPCDAm led to changes in both the legal sanctions for deforestation, as well as substantial
changes in the enforcement of environmental regulation. In particular, a new remote-sensing
system for environmental monitoring and enforcement was created (DETER), which in turn
fed coordinated enforcement actions between many government institutions (see more details
in Assunção et al., 2013).
In sum, while the vast majority of deforestation in the Amazon was illegal prior to 2005,
the de jure legal sanctions associated with deforestation substantially increased in 2005.
Yet despite all the migration and infrastructure policies supported since the military government, and despite all the recent enforcement measures promoted by the PPCDAm, the deep
Amazon – the area we study in this paper – is still very much a frontier region. Cattle ranchers and illegal loggers are still active. “At the end of the road, on the Amazonian frontier, it
feels like the Wild West, except with motor bikes and cell phones,” wrote the Vice President
and Chief Scientist of WWF, Jon Hoekstra, back in 2010.24 In an interview to the New York
Times in 2014, a top official of IBAMA, Luciano Evaristo, said about one county black listed

25

by the government, Novo Progresso (literal translation New Progress): “this is the Wild West
of environmental crimes. We are waging an endless war.”25
B.3.3

The second reversal

The driving forces of the reversal we observe starting in 2014 cannot be mapped to a single
policy or de jure regulatory change. Brazilian environmental governance was undermined over
the years since 2011 by the growing political power of the agriculture producers, consecutive
weak governments and scarce public resources.26
Political support for the environmental agenda. The loosening of environmental
agenda began in 2011 with President Rousseff’s first mandate. The new government adopted a
more conservative environmental position relative to the previous year, with a greater focus on
promoting economic development through large investments in infrastructure.27 As Viola and
Franchini (2017, Ch. 5) describes, the “Rousseff administration displayed a visible neglect for
forest-related and environmental issues”. The growing political power of the “ruralists” – i.e.,
the rural caucus of Congress (Rochedo et al., 2018) – also contributed to the reduced political
will to sustain and advance the environmental agenda of the previous years. The number of
congressmen in the “ruralists” caucus had grown to 142 in the 2011-2014 legislature – 28% of
the seats – from 116 and 79 in the previous two legislatures. The ruralists continued to grow
and to push an environmental deregulation agenda in 2015, when this political group elected
207 congressmen – 38% of the Congress (Crouzeilles et al., 2017; Freitas et al., 2018)
Background economic and political turmoil. The widespread social mobilizations in
2013 set the government in crisis, which was fired with a series of corruption scandals involving
all levels of the Workers Party administration (Viola and Franchini, 2017). As 2014 was an
election year, the government increased public spending to gain the popular support needed
for re-election. These economic measures helped re-elect Ms. Rousseff but deteriorated the
fiscal situation of the federal government, setting the country in its worst economic crisis ever.
Brazilian GDP shrank by 3.7 % in 2015 and by 3.5 % in 2016. Unemployment rate surged
quickly. The focus of the federal government shifted to control the economic crisis and the
consequences of the corruption scandals. In such unstable political scenario, Ms. Rousseff
was impeached by the congress in 2016. The new president Michel Temer was the former
vice-president and also involved in the alleged corruption schemes. With very thin public
support, the new president had to accommodate the demands from his supporters in congress,
in particular, the ruralist caucus.
Environmental regulation. As consequence of this political shift, the congress approved

26
See, e.g., Tollefson (2016); Fearnside (2016); Viola and Franchini (2017); Crouzeilles et al. (2017); Rochedo
et al. (2018); Freitas et al. (2018); Soterroni et al. (2018); Tollefson (2018).
27
Still in President Lula’s government, Ms. Rousseff had an investment agenda to promote growth (Plano
de Acelera;’ao do Crescimento, PAC) and was an antagonist of Ms. Marina Silva, the Minister of Environment
who led PPCDAm. Ms. Silva eventually left the government and the Workers Party, while Ms. Rousseff was
chosen the Workers Party’s candidate on the 2010 presidential election.

26

of the New Forest Code (FC) in 2012 – Law 12.651/2012. This is the main change in environmental regulation in the period. The revised FC had many controvert points, one of them the
forgiven of “small” properties (those with less than 440 ha in the Amazon) that had deforested
before 2008 beyond the maximum allowed by PPCDAm. This effectively would give amnesty
to illegal deforestation inside private properties for 90% of Brazilian rural properties, with potential impact of reducing the Brazilian environmental debt by 58% (Soares-Filho et al., 2014).
Another contested point, the authorization of exploitation of Areas of Permanent Protection
(APP), such as riparian zones, was decentralized from the federal to the state governments.
The constitutionality of different items of the new FC were contested in the Supreme Court
already in 2013. The FC stayed under analysis until 2018, when the Supreme Court sanctioned
the New Forestry Code, including the amnesty item. After 2012, congress made repeated efforts to undo key aspects of the regulatory framework – for example, the revoke of protected
areas, and the discontinuation of environmental licensing for infrastructure projects (PEC 65).
In 2017, the congress approved a law (no. 3.465/2017) simplifying the requirements for land
regularization and titling of occupied public land in rural and urban areas. Rural smallholders
that settled in unclaimed lands before December 2016 could obtain land title for free, while
larger properties had the option to pay for the land title.
Enforcement capacity. The resources available to IBAMA (the Environmental Regulatory Agency) to enforce environmental regulation were trimmed over the years. An audit from
the Office of the Comptroller General (CGU, 2016) document that the number of IBAMA’s
enforcement officers fell 13.1% between 2010 and 2012, and fell 24% between 2010 and 2014.
The report also attend that the officers still working in 2016 tend to be older – 38% of them
had been working at IBAMA for more than 30 years. Figure A8 also shows that the budget of
IBAMA was cut by 34.2% between 2013 and 2014. During the two years of Ms. Rousseff second
mandate, IBAMA’s budget was cut additional 13.5% relative to 2014. In 2016, the budget of
IBAMA was 57 percent of its budget in 2013.
Thus, more than the de jure impact of the new FC, the “amnesty afforded by the new FC
could lead to the perception that illegal deforesters are unlikely to be prosecuted and may even
be exonerated in future law reforms” (Soares-Filho et al., 2014, pg.364). This perception should
have been reinforced by the deterioration of enforcement apparel. Although it is difficult to
map how the New Forest Code or the constrained enforcement capacity of IBAMA affected
deforestation in each type of land, our results in Figure 5b indicate a trend reversal starting
in 2012 specially in private properties and unclaimed lands. The average point estimate of the
differential impact of Brazilian policies in private properties that abut the national borders is
81% larger in the 2014-2018 period than in 2009-2011.
B.3.4

The formation of the Brazilian border

Since we focus on the Brazilian border, it is useful to understand briefly the history of how
the border was drawn. The broad limits of the Brazilian territory were defined in the colonial
period when the Portuguese and the Spanish Crowns had very limited knowledge about the

precise geography of the center of the South American continent. As such, they usually do not
correspond to major differences in economic opportunity – and as we will see, include many
arbitrary straight-line segments.
The Treaty of Madrid defined the general lines of the Portuguese – Brazilian – border with
the Spanish colonies in 1750. When drawing the Treaty of Madrid map, Portugal and Spain
agreed on two general guidelines: (i) who had first established local presence should keep the
area (uti possidetis); (ii) rivers should be used as border divisions as much as possible to easy
demarcation. The main objective of Portugal during the negotiations was to hold the control
of the (known) mining regions located between the center of the continent and the Atlantic
coast, pushing the border West to keep potential invaders away. The main objective of the
Spanish crown was to maintain navigable access to the sea. As such, the Treaty of Madrid set
the limits of the colonies in that region would be defined by the Paraguay and Guaporé Rivers,
which are located more than 200km and more than 500km, respectively, from the Portuguese
westernmost important settlement, Cuiabá.
At the time, in the middle of the 18th century, the areas in the center of the South American
continent – and which form the borders we study today – were still largely unknown. This was
particularly true for the Amazon area and the Northern segment of the Brazilian border. Indeed,
the magnitude of this “unknown” land can be seen by the vast blank spaces in the base map
used in the Treaty of Madrid: Carte de l’Amérique Méridionale.28 In fact, the precise location
of rivers’ springs and mouths – and what was between them – was not exact. The straight-line
28

“[The] Carte de l’Amérique Méridionale shows, with great detail and many new local circumstances, the
empty state of our knowledge with large completely naked spaces” (D’Anville (1779)).

28

segments we can see in the Brazilian border are a consequence of this lack of information.
These are due to rivers that followed a different path than the predicted one or that ended
before reaching other geographic feature – and in such cases, the Treaty of Madrid (and the
subsequent 1867 Treaty of Ayacucho) specified that a straight line should be used instead.29

29

Article VI of the Treaty of Madrid says “... and, from there, seek the straight line by higher ground to the
main head of the more nearby river, which flows into the Paraguay River for its Eastern bank, which might be
what they call Corrientes.” The Treaty of Ayacucho (1867) that defined the precise border between Brazil and
Bolivia, more than 100 years later, writes: “This river to the West follow the border by a parallel, taken from
the left bank in South latitude 10º 20’ until you find the Javary River. If Javary River has its sources North
from this East-West line, follow the border, from the same latitude, for a line to get the main source of said
Javary.”.
