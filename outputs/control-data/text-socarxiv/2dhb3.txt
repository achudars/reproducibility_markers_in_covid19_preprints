Abstract
The purpose of this study is to investigate the tax culture of tax payers in the Iranian Tax Administration.
This was an applied-descriptive survey study. The statistical population was divided into three groups
according to the share of tax revenue in 2017 and 12 provinces from 31 provinces selected by cluster and
quota sampling. The sample size was calculated using the Cochran formula for a large population of 690
people for each group. A questionnaire was used to collect data. The content validity of the questionnaires
was confirmed by the experts and the construct validity was verified by factor analysis. The reliability of
the questionnaires was also calculated using Cronbach's alpha (0.925). The data were analyzed using
correlation coefficient, mean test and factor analysis using the Structural Equation Modeling in LISREL.
The results showed that each of the components of the tax culture of the tax payers was higher than
satisfactory.
Key words: Culture, Tax culture, Tax payers
Introduction
Tax culture is a mixture of attitudes, beliefs and actions taken by people regrding the tax system and we
learn about what is our duty considering the tax system and what role should we play. Financing government
expenditures through tax revenues is one of the issues that has been considered by government in recent
years in developing countries, including Iran (Mahboubi et al., 2011). Efforts to create a leading and strong
tax culture in the country can have a significant impact on reducing costs, increasing government revenues
and creating effective controls that increase social justice and welfare. Therefore, development of the tax
system of each country is considered as the main symbols of its comprehensive and balanced development.
The key role of culture is not solely limited to implementation of tax laws. In all democratic societies, the
rate of growth and awareness of the laws and its consequences will make the system more effective. To this
end, policymakers of these types of societies believe in a direct link between culture and law (Salehi et al.,
2014).
With the creation of a coherent tax system, government reliance on oil revenues is reduced and a large
portion of its current and developmental costs are provided. In this context, it seems necessary to develop
and promote a tax culture. However, for cultural development in all societies, one cannot predict a fixed
criterion (because there are many factors in the cultural impact of each society separately), but what is
common in all societies, is the reaction and influence of laws from the culture of each society (Shamsuddini
and Shahraki, 2016). Although the rule of law cannot be separated from people's thinking about the law,
and customs are usually used in the creation of laws, it should be considered that in dealing with important
phenomena, coordinating people attitudes of this specific term requires planning and futurism (Hassan
Ghayamety Arani, 2013).
Iran is a low-income and low-tax country among the countries of the world in terms of tax effort (Lee Blanc
et al., 2008), so that, the escape and tax avoidance is a social norm (Salehi et al., 2014).

All this suggests an accurate and important point: the state of our tax culture is not in a good condition, and
our society suffers from the weakness of the country's culture. Therefore, the main question of the present
research is as follows: What is the status of the components of the tax culture of the taxpayers in the studied
population?

Based on the results of his
research,
positive
attitude
towards the job and the
appropriateness of the business
environment of the tax brokers,
enforcement of guarantees and
respect of the clients and
protection and safeguarding of
their employees are among the
factors influencing the culture
Taxes.
The results of the research
showed that according to the
hierarchical analysis method,
public trust in tax allocation and
consumption, honesty and sense
of responsibility of taxpayers
and appropriate tax culture (tax
belief among the general
population) are respectively the
most important factors affecting
tax compliance.
There is a meaningful
relationship between
management factors and the
promotion of tax culture as a
result of increased tax
collection. Simplicity and
comprehensiveness of laws and
regulations, the implementation
of modern procedures, the
availability of equipment and
administrative facilities, and
continuing training, are effective
in developing and promoting a
tax culture.

The dynamic behaviors of tax

The results of the test showed
that: 1. Level of tax culture
among the population is below
the average; 2. Lack of
knowledge of the people about
the importance of paying taxes is
one of the factors inhibiting tax
culture; 3. Simplifying the texts
of tax laws and rationalizing the
stages of obtaining taxes have an
impact on the promotion of tax
culture; 4. Education of people
with tax laws and regulations
reduces diagnosis and promotes
tax culture; 5. Increasing the
equity and functioning of the tax
organization has an impact on
promoting tax culture; and 6
Honesty and the sense of
responsibility of tax payers are
one of the factors promoting tax
culture.
There
is
no
meaningful
difference between the tax
culture and the level of expertise
of physicians
The results of a survey conducted
on 195 of the tax payers in West
Tehran indicate that there is a
relationship between the need to
pay taxes, tax laws, how taxes are
levied, tax officials, and the tax
culture.
Standard deterrent policies
cannot
eliminate
multiple
balances, instead policies that
impose a strong moral tax on
taxes and corrupt politicians can
lead to a unique balance.
Regarding compliance with tax
laws, tax management and tax
reform have been assessed for
taxpayers and taxgivers. The
results obtained from these
studies show that differences in
tax culture lead to different
consequences for tax collecting.
Over the past two decades, new
approaches
(eg
laboratory

Bai-Alddar et al. (2013)

Study of the impact of national
culture on levels of tax evasion

experiments,
material-based
modeling, etc.) have been
developed with the viewpoints of
how to increase behavioral
dynamics or avoid tax evasion. In
addition, there is empirical
evidence that supports the role of
such interaction dynamics.
After controlling the factors
mentioned above, a subset of the
influential cultural values that
are stipulated by the levels of
irregularity to predict tax
evasion. The findings suggest
that there are a number of
experimental empirical and
experimental research concepts.

Methodology
The present research was a quantitative exploratory applied descriptive case study. The statistical
population was selected from the tax payers of Iranian tax administration and random cluster sampling was
used to select participants from each province. Since the size of the statistical population was large, it was
not possible to examine the ideas of the entire statistical population in terms of time and cost. Therefore,
cluster sampling was done as follows:
In the first stage, the statistical population (31 provinces of the country) was divided into three groups of
provinces with high, medium and low tax revenue, based on the tax revenue share of each province to total
tax revenues of the country in 2017. The first group devoted 48%, the second group 23% and the third
group 29% of the total tax revenue. According to the quota sampling, 7 provinces from the first group, 2
provinces from the second group and 3 provinces from the third group were selected randomly.
Accordingly, due to the large statistical population and the standard deviation of 0.67 and accuracy of 5%,
the sample size is calculated for each group from the below formula:

ùëçùõº √ó ùúé
ùëõ=(

2

ùëí

)2 = (

1.96 √ó 0.67 2
) = 690
0.05

For this purpose, 690 people were selected as a sample group. Finally, in order to prevent the participant
fall, to ensure delivering the questionnaires, a sample size of 800 persons per group was determined.
In the present study, both field and library methods were used to collect data. The research tool was a
researcher-made tax culture questionnaire whose face and conceptual validity was verified by the experts.
Then, for measuring the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha was used and it was 0.925, which
is a relatively good reliability.
The results of fitting the pattern of each of the model structures using the confirmatory factor analysis are
shown in Table 3. According to the presented indices, it can be said that the model of measurements has
appropriate fit. The results of the path coefficients and the t-Value are shown in Table 2.

Considering that the ratio of chi-square is less than 5, and the RMSEA index is less than 0.08, it shows that
the model has a good fit. Other indicators such as the NFI, the NNFI, the IFI, the CFI were used and values
above 0.9 of these indicators suggested a very good fit of model compared to other models.
In this research, after data editing, coding and entering of data, descriptive and inferential statistical methods
were used to analyze data in SPSS and Amos software.
Normality of data: According to the central limit theorem, this assumption is adhered to for single-variable
data and the present research data are normal.

Investigating the Status of Taxpayers culture and its Components in the population
The main question: What is the status of the tax culture of taxpayers in the studied population?

H0: The tax culture of taxpayers in the studied population is not in desirable condition.
H1: Tax culture of taxpayers in the studied population is in a favorable situation.
As shown in Table 8, given that the significance level of the test (0.000) is less than the significant level
(0.05), hypothesis one cannot be ruled out. In other words, according to the average obtained for this
variable and the index of Abbas Bazargan et al., it can be said that the status of tax culture in the studied
population is more than satisfactory.

Discussion and conclusion
The findings of this study showed that according to the mean scores obtained, each of the components of
the tax culture of the tax payers is more than satisfactory.
The ranking of the components of tax culture in the studied population was the "timly submission of tax
returns", the "timely payment of taxes", and "filing in the tax unit", respectivly. Therefore, the research
suggestions are as follows:
- Confidence building between tax authorities and taxpayers through holding reflection sessions.
- Strengthening Corporations and train them to promote tax culture among payers.
- Persuading taxpayers to pay taxes by using mass media.
- Promoting the importance of taxes by clerics and expressing tax debates and their necessity in the Islamic
society and obligation of tax payment by the islamic scholars.
- Familiarizing tax payers with tax collection procedures, specifying tax collection procedures and easy
access to tax laws.
- A clear and accurate description of employee policies, staff accountability and tax organization;
- Improving skills and experience in tax staff.
- Attention to the law on the ability to taxpayers‚Äô payment, heavy fines for offenders.
- The existence of tax punishments commensurate with the conduct of taxpayers, familiarity of tax brokers
with tax laws.
- Familiarity of tax brokers with the process of collecting taxes.
- Participation of tax payers in successful performance in organization policies.
- Notification of spending taxes to the taxpayers.
