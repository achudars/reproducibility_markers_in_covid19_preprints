INTRODUCTION

Summary
Identifying Open Access (OA) publications might seem a trivial task while practical efforts prove
otherwise. In this project, we wanted to assign OA tags to publications in KB database. We queried
KB in-house database up to 2017 (including Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus) for all articles and
reviews. We then matched the corresponding DOIs to three sources of OA information: Unpaywall,
Crossref and Bielefeld list of gold OA journals. This allowed us to define the OA status for publications.
We found close to 14 million publications (articles and reviews between 2000 and 2016) from WOS
(69.75% of all) and close to 18 million from Scopus (68.67% of all) with an equivalent DOI in Unpaywall.
We matched KB publications database with Crossref data (from April 2018) and found 53 distinct
licence URLs, which define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. We found
that more than half a million publications have more than one licence record in Crossref (in contrast
to near 8 million with only one record and more than 6 million without a licence URL). We evaluated
if these licences were open or closed access. We also matched respective journal ISSNs with DOAJ
and ROAD databases and presented a categorization of publications to Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and
Delayed OA accounting for uncertainty due to missing licence information via a new sub-category
Probable Hybrid OA. We validate our findings via manual checks and a crosscheck of OA information
from the aforementioned varying sources. While the manual check on a sample of publications
revealed a small but noticeable degree of apparently incorrect meta-information on publication’s
OA status, the contrast of OA information from the diverse OA information sources highlights the
partially unsteady base for an OA monitoring based on open data.

Introduction
Open access (henceforth OA) in scholarly communication describes unrestricted access to published
peer-reviewed documents written by and addressed to researchers. These documents have traditionally been disseminated via publications in scientific journals, which charge for access to the
respective content (“pay-to-read”). Stimulated by a call for greater openness and transparency in
general (“open science”), the OA movement has nowadays been accepted as one, though not the
only, alternative for the dissemination of scholarly documents. Even publishers seem to embrace
this new model as providing a suitable infrastructure while at the same time securing their own
economic interests (“pay-to-publish”). This inter-mixture of interests has resulted not only in one,
but several forms of OA publications, which can tentatively be categorized as follows:
• Gold OA: A document published in a journal entirely devoted to OA. The OA character of the
journal is usually defined via inclusion in lists like the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)
or Directory of Open Access scholarly Resources (ROAD).
• Hidden gold OA: A document published in an OA journal not listed in Gold OA directories
• Hybrid OA: A document published in an subscription journal, but freely accessible due to a fee
paid by the authors to the publisher
• Green OA: A version of the published document archived by the authors in a repository or on
a personal website in line with the rights granted by the publisher to the authors
• Delayed OA: A document published in a subscription journal, but becoming free to read on
the publisher’s website after a pre-defined time period
• Bronze OA: A document published in a subscription journal, but being made freely accessible
at the publisher’s will.

INTRODUCTION

• Black OA: A document made freely available by ignoring copyright. According to some publishers, documents provided by academic social networks like ResearchGate might also fall into
this category.
Due to the individual ascription of single publications to one or several of these categories and
the decentralized structure of the scientific publishing market with a variety of diverse publishers,
the identification of OA is less trivial than it might seem. Nearly all large bibliometric data providers
rely on external information from a single source to provide information on OA1 and most large scale
undertakings by the scientometric community to obtain reliable information on OA prevalence rely
on the use of web crawlers [1, 7] with their inherent uncertainty on the scope, quality and timeliness
of the outcome.
Enriching the KB infrastructure with reliable (even if only partial) information on OA would
broaden the available information base. This could be used to improve reports and reporting tools
written by the KB partners and would also allow analysis of a further facet of current scientific
communication practices and its implications for science studies.
Consequently we match WoS and Scopus to three different and freely available sources of OA
information: Unpaywall, Crossref and Bielefeld list of Gold OA Journals. We compare the information content of each source concerning the aforementioned OA categories in order to assess the
information surplus each source potentially provides and report on the general matching feasibility
of each source with the WoS and Scopus to appraise the trustworthiness of a WoS/Scopus based
analysis of OA uptake.
Inspired by the Hybrid OA Dashboard [5] we applied licensing information supplied by publishers
to the publisher association Crossref to identify OA publication. The restricted access to published,
peer-reviewed documents is enforced via a legal framework, which is predominately based upon
copyright laws. In the publication process authors transfer the copyright (or solely the exclusive
reproduction rights) to a publisher and the publisher uses these rights as a legal instrument to restrict
access. Given this perspective any identification of OA publications must therefore also be based
upon legal information, which defines the access character of the publication as imposed by the
copyright holder, i.e. the licence supplied by the publisher to Crossref.
Unpaywall [10] is an open database of information on the access status of more than 20 million
scholarly publications. In their words, they “harvest Open Access content from over 50,000 publishers
and repositories, and make it easy to find, track, and use”. Consequently their web crawler might also
identify green OA publications on repositories or bronze OA publications on publishers’ websites.
The Bielefeld list of Gold OA Journals might be distinguished by its more narrow focus on the
identification of Gold OA journals by combining popular Gold OA journal list like Directory of Open
Access Journals (DOAJ)2 and Directory of Open Access scholarly Resources (ROAD)3 stressing the
ambiguity of OA information sources.
The structure of the report is as follows: In Section 2, we present our data and methods. In
Section 3 we present our findings, while we discuss our main results in Section 4.

DATA & METHOD

Data & Method
We queried all publications from Scopus and WOS in the KB database (wos_b_2017 and scopus_b_2017)4 . Data included a publication’s unique KB identifier and DOI. We matched those
DOIs with the Unpaywall database from April 18th 2018 currently available in the KB infrastructure
to determine the OA status for each single publication. Note that current Unpaywall data on KB only
includes the so called best OA location per DOI in Unpaywall terminology. Therefore more detailed
information will be available once other Unpaywall OA locations are added to the KB infrastructure.
In parallel to Unpaywall, we also matched those DOIs with Crossref data (snapshot from beginning
of May 2018) and retrieved the available information on the licences of publications5 .
We used the journals’ ISSNs provided by Wohlgemuth, Rimmert and Winterhager [14] (and the
updated version in Rimmert et al. [9]) to identify Gold OA publications. They use different known OA
indexes (e.g. DOAJ and ROAD) and determine if the respective ISSN is listed in those databases. They
differentiate between ISSN and ISSNL with the latter being more fine-grained by adding a specific
ISSN to some special issues. We tried both ISSN and ISSNL, since the latter had higher matching
records, therefore in our analysis presented in the Results section we use the ISSNL.
An initial list of licences had been compiled by the “Dissemin”6 project. Seven licences7 might
be found on the dissemin project’s Github repository of which two were missing from the 56 unique
licences we identified in Crossref corpus (matched with WoS, respectively Scopus) while many others
are added and investigated in the Results section.
It is necessary to note that some publications had multiple licence URLs in Crossref database
(see Table 2 for the frequencies of these publications), we followed a procedure with four steps to
ensure using only one licence per publication:
1. If a publication had only one record in Crossref database, whether it had an OA, non-OA8
licence or no licence information (i.e. NA), we used this status and categorized the publication
as a unique one.
2. If a publication had multiple OA licence URLs, we removed the duplicates and categorized it as
OA.
3. If a publication had a mixture of OA and non-OA licence URLs, we removed the duplicates and
categorized it as OA.
4. If a publication had multiple non-OA licence URLs, we removed the duplicates and categorized
it as non-OA.
A research assistant controlled the unique licences (a total of 56) we extracted from Crossref
with available information online to categorize them as OA and non-OA. We used this categorization
4 We wrote SQL and R [8] scripts to interact with in-house Scopus and WOS databases in KB. To work on data, we used
base [8], dplyr [13], stargazer [4], ggplot2 [12], tidyverse, jsonlite [6] and stringdist [11] packages to write data cleaning and
statistical analysis procedures.
5 It is necessary to note that our effort to send large number of requests to Crossref API (even while using plus service
and through both RCrossref package in R and more fine-grained HTTR requests directly to Crossref API) faced timeout and
response time errors and alternatively we chose to use the in-house snapshot of the Crossref data to circumvent the above
error. This meant parsing large corpus of JSON files which can be time consuming depending on the goals of the analysis. Any
effort on automating the proposed OA identification procedure needs to overcome the technical issues like this.

DATA & METHOD

in parallel to established OA identification procedures (e.g., searching for journal’s ISSN in DOAJ in
Gold OA identification) to ensure a higher level of validity in our results.
In OA Identification process and in order to determine if a publication was OA or not, as
mentioned in our proposal (page 3), we applied a multi-category view separating Gold, Hidden Gold,
Hybrid and Delayed OA, while doing so, we reached a new subcategory of Probable Hybrid OA to
account for uncertainty arising from incomplete licence information on Crossref.
Our investigation strategy for each category was as follows:
• Gold OA: As described earlier, we used the ISSNs provided by Rimmert et al. [9] to determine
Gold OA. We matched the respective ISSN (from both WOS and Scopus) with DOAJ and ROAD.
If the respective ISSN was listed in one of those directories, the publication is categorized as
Gold OA.
• Hidden Gold OA: We applied the KB issue identifier from WOS and Scopus to determine the
journal issue and looking at the licences of all publications in a single issue, if all publications had
OA licences, but the ISSN was not indexed in DOAJ or ROAD we categorized it as Hidden Gold
OA. A cross-check among all issues of the respective journals is currently not implemented.
• Hybrid OA: If an issue had at least one non-OA publication while having one or more OA
publications, we categorized the OA publications as Hybrid OA.
• Probable Hybrid OA: If an issue did not have a non-OA publication while having one or more OA
publications and some publications in the issue didn’t have licence information, we categorized
them as Probable Hybrid OA.
• Delayed OA: In all of the above cases, we looked into delays based on Crossref metadata
(a difference in terms of days from day of publication and the date licence was assigned to
the publication as described in CrossRef-API [3], this is the time period known as embargo
time9 ) to determine if they were Delayed, therefore each of the above categories were split to
two groups, delayed and not-delayed. Publication with multiple licence URLs on Crossref and
diverging delay information for each of these licences (2.5% of all publications) were excluded
from the analysis.
• Closed Access: Strictly speaking, if the number of publications in an issue was equal to the
number of non-OA publications and the ISSN was not indexed in DOAJ or ROAD, we categorized
them as Closed Access.
• Not available (NA): A publication that was not fitting in any of the above categories or did
not have a licence URL to determine its condition was categorized as NA. Number of NAs are
higher than Closed Access publications, since we aimed to keep the definitions as strict as
possible.
It is important to note, in our matches with OA databases, we needed to use the DOI, which is
not as standard as it is hoped. We found contradictory cases of duplicate DOIs and upper and lower
case usages which is not coherent either by the publisher or OA metadata providers or even between
WOS and Scopus. As an example, while exact matching it is possible to find 11,346,682 (57.03%)
article and review publications from WOS with a match on Unpaywall, once lower case DOI is used,
this is increased to 13,886,618 (69.8%). Furthermore some DOIs are mentioned several times in
WoS, repectively Scopus, refering to different publications and consequently violating the identifier
9 As described in CrossRef-API [3], the delay in days field in Crossref API and metadata: license.delay returns an integer number where difference between publication date and the license ref’s start_date attribute is <= {integer} (in days). Example,
to query “all works funded by 10.13039/100000015 where license = CC-BY and embargo <= 365 days”,following URL could be
send to Crossref API: https://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100000015/works?filter=license.url:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,license.delay:365

function of the DOI. Therefore, in results presented we have first trimmed and lower cased the DOI
from both data sources, excluded publications with duplicated DOIs and then matched them.
While this inconsistency in the data processing in WoS or Scopus can be resolved, other issues
persist and confine the matching. In detail we observe 63 (913) journals indexed in WoS (Scopus)
between 2000 and 2016 without an ISSN, 23,000+ (140,000+) articles and reviews between 2000
and 2016 without a unique DOI (which are excluded from our results), 5,700,000+ (7,400,000+)
publications without any DOI and 2,700,000+ (4,500,000+) publications with a DOI which can’t be
resolved on Crossref. Potential remedies like an alternative match on title information have currently
not been implemented.
It is necessary to note that current report is an updated version of the initial KB report, in which
we have parsed Crossref JSON files and matched publications with Crossref and Unpaywall again. In
current update, we used the above mentioned DOI matching strategy (i.e. limited to only articles
and reviews between 2000-2016 excluding publications with duplicated DOIs) while the two random
samples discussed in the end of this report are unchanged (since the licence status and publication
type of them were intact). This update increased Unpaywall and Crossref matches and coverage
rates.In all the results that follow, while discussing WOS and Scopus we refer to the limited subset
based on the above selection criteria.

Results
We present the results in two main sections, one regarding Unpaywall and the other one licences
extracted from Crossref. We then present the comparison between OA information deduced from
Unpaywall and Crossref and the results of our manual checks on random samples for robustness
of the results. In the following results (in Unpaywall and Crossref results sections), publications
are limited to only articles and review papers published in 2000-2016 excluding publications with
duplicated DOIs and publications without a DOI.

Unpaywall Data
Table 1 shows the number of articles and review papers from WOS and Scopus which could be
matched with an equivalent DOI record in Unpaywall database. It presents also the total number of
publications in WOS/Scopus in separate rows (including the problematic cases discussed before with
duplicated DOIs) to provide a baseline for comparison. In our OA identification results that follows,
we have excluded all problematic cases. Unpaywall data currently available in the KB infrastructure
assigns an OA and non-OA status to each single publication and the accompanying journal.
Figure 1 presents a crosscheck of Unpaywall OA information via Bielefeld list of gold OA journals.
Due to a low degree of details on the currently available Unpaywall data in the KB, such a comparison is
currently limited to identify gold OA journals of the Bielefeld list in the Unpaywall corpus. Accordingly

Figure 1: Journals indexed in WOS and Scopus matched with Unpaywall database and crosschecked

Missing on DOAJ in these Figures refer to those journals whose ISSN was missing from Rimmert et al.
[9] data, therefore we could not check if the ISSN is listed in DOAJ or not while Others means the
ISSN was existing in Rimmert et al. [9] but it was not listed as OA in DOAJ.

Crossref data
We matched KB publications to Crossref data from May 2018 and found 53 distinct licence types
for all of the publications. Table 2 presents a descriptive view on whether publications have licence
information recorded in Crossref. As described in the Data & Method section, some of these publications had more than one licence information in Crossref (as an example, the number of DOIs that
each have 6 licence records on Crossref are 1,152). In case of multiple licences, if a publication had
at least one OA licence, we categorized it as OA. Table 7 in the Appendix section presents a list of
these licences, their frequencies and respective OA status10 .
Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA
Applying the assumptions detailed in the Data & Method section we may separate several OA types.
Hence, Figure 2 present the Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA status of the publications
from WOS and Scopus. To make these Figures more readable, we removed NA (those without a

information on other webpages of the same website (i.e., “http://www.bmj.org/licenses/tdm/1.0/terms-and-conditions.html”
which in newer link in “https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/publishing-model” it is stated that “All research papers in The BMJ
are published with open access, and this also fulfills the requirements of the US National Institutes of Health, the UK Medical
Research Council, the Welcome Trust, and other funding bodies by making the full text of publicly funded research freely
available to all on bmj.com and sending it directly to PubMed Central, the National Library of Medicine’s full text archive.”, as
a result we treated those publications as OA, and in case of “http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/userlicense.xhtml” in the newer
link in “https://www.pnas.org/page/authors/licenses” it is mentioned that “All PNAS articles are free online within 6 months
of publication. Authors who choose the open access option will have their articles made available without cost to the reader
immediately upon publication. All content, regardless of funding, is automatically deposited by PNAS in PubMed Central and
made free within 6 months of publication.” so we treated them as TDM or Other).

Unpaywall and Crossref comparison
Figure 3 presents the OA status of WoS and Scopus indexed publications as detailed in Unpaywall and
Crossref. Apart from the OA (licence) status we also highlight matching issues, i.e. indexed publication
without a recorded DOI or a recoreded DOI which can not be matched to either Unpaywall or Crossref.
The large share of Scopus indexed publication with a recorded DOI, but no match on Crossref is
especially composed of Chinese journals which probably refer to a different DOI registration agency
than Crossref. Note that share of OA publications is increasing over the years. Coverage of Unpaywall
and Crossref is, clearly for WoS and to lesser extend for Scopus, increasing as well.
Figure 4 presents the share of WoS and Scopus indexed publications with an open access licence,
respectively OA status on Crossref and Unpaywall. We limited the years to 2000-2016 to show the
most recent trends. Both sources show an increasing trend of OA publications in recent years while
Unpaywall has a higher coverage that we suspect could be due to Green OA and especially Bronze
OA [2] inclusion. While we used licences information from Crossref but current Unpaywall data on
KB database does not allow us to determine the extend to which the presented share in Unpaywall

developed using respective licence URLs. We double checked the contradictory cases and improved
our while-list of OA licences, while some of the contradictions remain (e.g., Unpaywall declares those
publications as OA while they are closed access or vice versa, in case of licences on Crossref that
are open access while the publication is declared as non-OA on Unpaywall). Especially green and
bronze OA publications might not be inferred from the licence alone, but can be identified via the
Unpaywall web crawler.

and 14.54% in Scopus) or vice versa, OA publications (based on either Unpaywall, Crossref or both)
that are not accessible online (17.57% in WOS and 16.74% in Scopus). Note also the contradictory
cases between Crossref and Unpaywall, where metadata from one shows OA and the other Closed,
which requires further probes (22.98% in WOS and 22.91% in Scopus). One could follow-up and
use PDF URLs provided by Unpaywall in large scale to control the ratio of publications which can be
accessed.

Conclusion
It is clear that publishing as OA is on the rise in recent years. This trend is observed similarly in WOS
and Scopus (while Scopus has higher raw publication counts but trends are identical) and based on
OA identification stemming from both Unpaywall and Crossref. But still the majority of publications
are closed access. We observed that despite the high coverage of Unpaywall (higher than 68%
of articles and reviews in both WOS and Scopus), it doesn’t provide enough metadata (as of April
2018) for an exhaustive OA categorization thus could be limiting for large scale OA monitoring in the
leading bibliometric databases. On the other hand licence information from Crossref is more detailed
and provides an additional legal perspective to complement Unpaywall metadata, but potentially
lacks in coverage till publishers completely take on the responsibility to provide a wide range of
metadata to Crossref. Participation reports by Crossref showing the availability of, among others,

licence information by individual publishers currently does not constitute a helpful monitoring tool,
as it does not diferentiate between licences on the (open) access status or the completely unrelated
text and data mining purposes. In the meantime a more detailed provision of Unpaywall data in the
KB infrastructure could help to clarify the additional information value of each source.
We observed several contradictions between the applied OA information sources and manual
random checks. Some publications were OA (based on their licences or Unpaywall status) while
their PDF files were not accessible through publishers’ websites. Some publications were closed
access, while their PDF files were accessible questioning the validity of the provided OA metadata
and highlighting the unsteady base of publicly available OA information.
We found that the issue of multiple records for some publications or multiple licence information
is something that needs to be seriously considered in a licence based OA monitoring. While we tried
to test different scenarios in OA identification, still there are publications that won’t fit into any of
the scenarios and we had to categorize them as NA (since we wanted to keep the Closed Access
definition as strict as possible), these are the publications that need to be further studied and usually
the metadata of the OA databases are lacking for them. Furthermore separating licences for text
and data mining use cases from licences governing access rights might streamline the licence based
analytical pipeline.
Finally a critical review of the normalized DOI matching strategy applied in this report (e.g. the
match between KB data and Crossref was improved by normalizing DOIs e.g., roughly 21% in WOS
and 29% in Scopus) but finding alternative approaches to match metadata of publications from
WOS/Scopus with Crossref and Unpaywall (e.g., using a combination of title, journal name, and other
metadata) might lead to an increase in coverage (or less false positives) and could generally improve
the validity of OA monitoring approaches.

Appendix
Table 7 presents all of the unique licences we found in Crossref and OA status our research assistant
obtained manually using available information on each licence URL on the web. As described in Table
2), this table includes DOIs with multiple records on Crossref.
Tables 8 and 9 present a yearly view to publications from WOS and Scopus, respectively, which
do not have a licence URL recorded in Crossref.
Tables 10 and 11 present the number of publications from WOS and Scopus which did not match
any of the OA categories we presented in Figures 2. These numbers were filtered out of the two
Figures to make them more readable.
