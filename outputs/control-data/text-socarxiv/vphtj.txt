Abstract
This paper develops new text-mining methods to measure the recognition of
American workers in the U.S. press and in American movies. The text-mining program
searches 167,193 newspaper articles and 18,056 movie plots for over 35,000 job titles and
codes them into standard U.S. Census occupational categories. These occupations are then
recoded into common definitions of the working class and tracked over time. For The New
York Times since 1980, recognition of working-class jobs has not declined, but it was
always low. For regional American papers like the St. Louis Post Gazette, the Detroit News,
or the Tampa Bay Times, working-class occupations had once enjoyed higher levels of
recognition, but the rates have declined recently to levels similar to the New York Times.
U.S. produced movies show a similar decline since 1930 in working-class inclusion.

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”?
The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture
“...the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored,
and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities
crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and
women of our country.” Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention
2016.
The Trump campaign message resonated with a broad section of American voters.
But was there any truth in the claim? Had the American cultural elite neglected, ignored,
and abandoned the working class? Working-class incomes had stagnated for decades.
Small towns and mid-size cities throughout mid-America were suffering. Was anybody
paying much attention?
This paper develops new text-mining methods to evaluate the presence of and
changes in the recognition of American workers in the popular press and in American
movies. The text-mining program searches 167,193 newspaper articles and 18,056 movie
plots for over 35,000 job titles and codes them into standard U.S. Census occupational
categories. These occupations are then recoded into common definitions of the working
class and tracked over time.
Two aspects of the neglect hypothesis are investigated. First, has the presence of
the working class declined in recent years compared to what was standard in past decades?
Second, were coastal elites especially neglectful of workers compared to popular culture in
mid-America?
The results show that for a coastal elite newspaper like The New York Times,
recognition of working-class jobs has not declined, but it was always low. For regional
American papers like the St. Louis Post Gazette or the Detroit News, working-class

occupations had enjoyed higher levels of recognition, but the rates have declined recently
to levels similar to the Times. A second analysis of U.S. produced movies shows a similar
decline since 1930 in working-class inclusion. Some measures show a brief resurgence in
the 1970s but declining consistently in the decades since.
Conceptual Approach
In her 2017 ASA presidential address, Michéle Lamont paints a two dimensional
space of cultural inclusion and exclusion: recognition versus neglect and praise versus
stigma (Lamont 2018). Both dimensions are important, but it’s often praise versus stigma
that captures our attention while recognition versus neglect is overlooked as a means of
social exclusion. Trump appealed to working-class Americans along both dimensions, but
it was the “neglected, ignored, and abandoned” line that formed a distinctive appeal. It
both resonated with workers’ beliefs in their “rightful place” in American society and their
contempt for progressive elites who had ignored their struggles while benefiting from the
globalization that had wrecked their working-class communities. Lamont, Park, and AyalaHurtado (2017) counted 217 times in 73 election campaign speeches that Trump referred
to workers, “which makes this group one of the most frequently mentioned categories.”
The separate dimensions of recognition and valuation are related in interesting
ways. Together, they do not create a fully saturated two-dimensional space. Recognition
may be either positive or negative; stigmatizing a group is not ignoring them. But neglect,
almost by definition, can be neither stigmatizing nor honorific; it is exclusionary but
without any specific content that is stigmatizing. So, we need to consider a two
dimensional space that is not fully saturated. A good representation would be more
triangular (see Figure 1).

A full consideration of cultural inclusion and exclusion must address both
dimensions. Trump not only highlighted workers’ distress, he also praised the traditional
working-class values of hard work (Lamont, Park, and Ayala-Hurtado 2017). But because
neglect can be neither explicitly positive nor negative, it requires our first research
attention. Once recognition is established, we can ask whether it asserts honor or stigma.
Past Research
Although there is a rich research literature on how the working class is portrayed in
popular culture (e.g., Ross 1998, Bodnar 2003, Kendall 2005), there is less on how much,
where, and when it is represented at all. Recognition or neglect have been more
prominent issues for other excluded groups: the sheer extent to which women, ethnic and
racial minorities, the poor, or LBGTQ groups are represented in movies, television, or the

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

4

media is a well-accepted part of research on their cultural exclusion. But the role of neglect
is less often incorporated into cultural studies of the working class.
There is an interesting study of working class images in magazine advertisements
(Paulson and O’Guinn 2012) – the hardworking Kelly Springfield tire man, the neighborly
Culligan water man, and the collaborative team of Amtrak workers. The sample is small,
but the frequency of these working-class images has declined since 1970 although they
were less common before 1970 also.
There is a substantial, more qualitative. literature on the content of that recognition
when it does occur, recognition of other groups in the news and in movies, and a rich
ethnographic tradition of recognition of working-class life among individual Americans.
Content analyses of class divisions have more often focused on the poor (e.g., Misra, Moller,
and Karides 2003, Rose and Baumgartner 2013) or elites (Van de Rigt et al. 2013). The
growing development of text-mining methods together with the availability of historical
digitized records opens up new opportunities for tracking changes in American culture not
only for recognition of the working class but for a wide variety of groups and social
relationships.
Methods
Coding occupations from texts
The text-mining program (Vanneman 2019) uses a lexicon that matches texts to a
list of over 35,000 natural language job titles each of which is paired to a numeric code
based on the 2010 U.S. Census occupation codes. The job titles are one- to three-word
phrases commonly found in English texts. The program matches first on the three-word

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

5

job titles, then the two-word, then single word job titles. This order ensures that “deputy
attorney general” is coded as a government official, not a police officer (“deputy”), lawyer
(“attorney”), and a military officer (“general”).
The origins of the job title list were two files of occupational coding instructions, a
2016 Census list of over 31,000 job titles ( https://www2.census.gov/programssurveys/demo/guidance/industry-occupation/occupation-index-september-2016.xlsx)
and a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) file of 10,000 job titles. Both lists required
substantial revision before they could be used with natural language text files. The Census
list, while quite comprehensive, often had multiple occupation codes for a single job title
depending on the industry location, only one of which could be used in a lexicon. Many job
titles, although readily interpreted by human coders, were not phrased as they would
appear in natural language (e.g., elevator mechanics are listed as “Mechanic, elevator”).
The BLS list, while having a unique occupation code for each job title, excludes job titles
that have more than a single Census occupation code.
The Census and BLS lists have been expanded to include military titles (e.g., General,
troop) and several illegal activities (e.g., thief, sex worker) not usually included in
occupational codes. Several occupational categories have been divided into subcategories
because of their frequency in popular culture (e.g., chief executives have been divided to
identify the President, governor, and other government chief executives). Several
gendered job titles have been divided to maintain that distinction (e.g., waiter is 4110 and
waitress is 4111; police officer is 3850 and policeman is 3851). New occupational
categories have been created for ambiguous job titles that fit within a broad range of

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

6

occupational codes (e.g., “senior partner” is coded as “Professional or Manager, not
specified” = 3280).
Some of the difficulties in applying a list of job titles to natural language text mining
are inherent in the complexities of English. These ambiguities create both errors of
omission and errors of commission. For example, many job titles are also proper names
(e.g., “Potter”) or names of sports teams (e.g., “Packers”, “Boilermakers”). To exclude these,
a second list of over 80 titles were coded as jobs only if not capitalized, eliminating the
proper names but thus missing some cases of actual jobs which were capitalized because of
sentence or text context (e.g., in newspaper headlines or at the start of a sentence). Other
phrases are job titles only when capitalized (e.g., “general”, “justice”) and so were coded as
occupations only if capitalized.
Some job titles have other common English meanings that cannot be disambiguated
by capitalization. “Cast”, for instance, is often the cast of a movie or play (2700, actors) but
is also used “to cast a vote”, “to cast doubt” or an “orthopedic cast” for a broken bone.
When the alternative meanings could themselves be identified (e.g., cast a vote), the
program codes them as non-jobs (9999). Having distinguished these other nonoccupational meanings, “cast”, by itself, then most often means the cast of a show and is
coded as 2700. Other job titles have meanings that are only occasionally actual job titles in
natural language (e.g., “driver”, “guard”, “page”) and so are not given an occupation code,
even though they do sometimes identify a job.
While many job titles are associated with multiple occupations, often those
occupations are quite similar so coding errors would be minor. However, some job titles

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

7

can be used for very different occupations. A painter could be an artist or a construction
worker. A scout could be a military observer or a talent scout for a sports team. Without
more consideration of the context than is now practical, these job titles cannot be
disambiguated. The text mining program often uses the code for the job more commonly
found in these texts (e.g., painters are 2600: artists; scouts are 9812: military). When the
text is more detailed, alternate codes can be assigned (e.g., “house painter” is 6420:
painters – construction). Nevertheless, some job titles are so ambiguous that they have
been given a separate occupation code, 9997, for example, “crew”, “intern”, or “officer” and
are not included in the analyses.
Some job titles refer to quite different occupations, but can be grouped into a broad
category encompassing the main meanings. For instance, “director” can be either a
director of a movie or play (= 2710, producers and directors) or a director of a corporation
or nonprofit (= 430, managers, other). More detailed job titles can be better classified (e.g.,
“executive director” is most often a manager not a dramatic director). However, when
unmodified, “director” is coded as a “professional and manager, not specified” (= 3280).
Other job titles that usually, but not always, refer to managerial and professional positions
(e.g., “aide”, “associate”, and “staff”) are given the code of 3288, general, likely professional
or managerial.
The job title list, the expanded occupational categories, and the python program
using the lists are publicly available (https://github.com/ReeveVanneman/occupations).
All are continually being revised based on experience, and suggestions or corrections are
welcome.

Working class code
A long research literature has debated which occupations and economic roles
should be classified as working class. The classification problem is further complicated in
natural language texts by ambiguous terms that often, but not always, connote workingclass positions. The main definition used in this paper derives from a tradition that
emphasizes class as a social relationship between positions with or without power over
other workers (Wright and Perrone 1977). Middle-class positions, in this definition, are
those who, like capital, control other workers but who, unlike capital, do not own the
means of production that employ them. Although initially this definition cross-cut
occupational classifications (e.g., carpenters can be workers, middle class, petty bourgeois,
or even employers), middle-class positions can be approximated by occupations that the
Census defines as managerial and professional (e.g., Vanneman 1977). Most of these
occupations have either direct supervisory control over other workers (e.g., managers) or
control over the organization of work (e.g., engineers) and its ideological supports
(Poulantzas 1974, Ehrenreich and Ehrenreich 1979). Coding professionals and managers
as middle class leaves most other occupations as working class. These include not only
blue-collar manual occupations (which encompass service work like food, recreational,
cleaning, and personal services), but also white-collar occupations such as clerical and
retail sales work as well as all technicians.
The overall working-class category also includes some job titles that could not be
coded into a single occupational category but encompass a broad range of work and
occupations that are clearly working class (e.g., “laborer” or “unskilled worker” and are
coded into a broad occupation category, 9760= laborer, nec). Such broad working-class

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

9

occupational categories are created for unskilled labor, skilled manual labor, and
unspecified clerical and retail sales work. They do not fit a standard Census code but are
given their own code that is included with other working-class occupations into the broad
working-class category.
More problematic are job titles that could refer to almost any occupational category
(e.g., “employee”, “crew member”, or an unmodified “worker”). In context, these
ambiguous titles most often implicitly refer to working-class rather than professionalmanagerial positions. They too are given an “occupation” code separate from the Census
codes, and can be combined with other working-class occupations in the broadest workingclass classification.
For robustness, this research has used three separate definitions of working-class
occupations ranging from the narrowest encompassing only manual blue-collar
occupations, an intermediate definition that also includes white collar occupations in
clerical and most sales jobs as well as most technicians, and the broadest which adds the
ambiguous titles that usually but not always signal working-class positions (e.g.,
“employee”). The frequencies of an article with any working class title vary as expected
across the three definitions. For instance, 30 percent of articles in the Times include a
mention of at least one working-class job title according to the broad definition; 24 percent
according to the intermediate definition; and only 11 percent when restricted to blue-collar
occupations. However, the regression results are generally similar across all three
definitions, so the reported results focus on the intermediate definition which includes
white collar job titles but excludes the somewhat ambiguous titles such as “employee” or

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

10

“worker”. The occasional differences in results across the three definitions are noted when
appropriate.
Other occupational classes
Four other categories of occupations are kept separate from a working-class middleclass dichotomy because of their prominence in institutional culture like the news and
Hollywood movies and their alternative positions in a simple middle-class vs. workingclass clasification. First, an “upper-class” category is reserved for capitalists (e.g.,
“financiers”, “industrialists”, “tycoons’), inherited aristocratic positions (“queen”, “duke”,
“sultan”), and inherited wealth (e.g., “heiress”, “landed gentry”).
Second, both the news and movies include a disproportionate inclusion of police so
they are separated into their own classification (including “cop”, “detective”, “FBI agent”,
“police chief” and other related titles). Similarly, the military, both officers and enlisted,
are a separate category excluded from the middle class – working class division. Finally,
although usually a smaller category than any of the above, farmers are separated into their
own category. Together, these other categories account for 31% of all occupational
mentions in the Times and occur at least once in 55% of the articles.
In addition to these occupation-based class codes, the program also separately
counts direct mentions of class and income-based categories: “blue collar”, “working class”,
“middle class”, “rich”, “poor”, and similar references. While it might be expected that these
class categories would be associated with the occupation-based categories, the correlations
are actually quite low (between .04 to .09) and generally lower than the correlations across
class within either the occupation-based or class-based codes. The class-based codes are

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

11

also less common. Especially for the newspaper articles, it would appear that the two types
of codes reflect different styles of recognizing class: one more specific and concrete, the
other more general and conceptual. The regression results are also quite different.
Measures of working-class recognition
The basic measure of working-class recognition is the simple dichotomy of whether
the text (a newspaper article or a movie plot) includes any mention of a working class job
title (as defined in the three alternatives described above). A second, more intensive,
measure requires at least three mentions of a working-class job title. Finally, a third
measure calculates the proportion of all occupational job titles coded in the text that are
working class. The three measures generally show similar comparisons across newspapers
and trends over time. The two alternative measures are reported only when substantive
differences are found with the simple presence vs. absence measure.
Text Sources
Newspaper articles were downloaded from Lexis/Nexis fully digitized records.
Lexis/Nexis has a limited sample of digitized newspapers and limited but varying years for
each source. Table 1 lists the years and number of articles for six newspapers that have
sufficient annual records to test the declining recognition hypothesis. Seven days were
sampled in each year (e.g., the second Monday in January, the last Thursday in October). All
articles from the sample day in each year were downloaded into a text corpus for each
newspaper. Very short articles (under 25 words) or very long articles (over 2500 words)
are dropped from the analyses, generally between 2 and 5 percent of all articles in each
paper.

Very long articles ( > 2500 words) and very short articles ( < 25 words) were dropped from the
analysis of each newspaper.
As in many analyses of the press, The New York Times is the principal representative
of the Eastern elite news media. Digitized texts are available from 1980 until the present.
Unfortunately, the major California newspapers are not available in Lexis/Nexis for
comparison of elite news sources from both coasts. In mid-America, the St. Louis PostDispatch has the longest series of digitized articles dating from 1989. Comparisons are also
made to three other mid-American newspapers, the Detroit News, the Pittsburgh PostGazette, and the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Finally, Lexis/Nexis has a reasonably long series
from the Tampa Bay Times (formerly the St. Petersburg Times) for analysis of a non-elite
but Southern news source.
Movie plots were downloaded from Wikipedia entries for U.S. produced (or coproduced) movies from 1930 to the present. While other internet summaries are available,
no other source of plot summaries is as complete or as well standardized. Wikipedia
editing guidelines suggest 500-700 word plot summaries, and non-conforming summaries
are regularly noted and revised. Wikipedia also maintains lists of all U.S. produced movies
for each year totaling 23,721 movies from 1930 through 2018. Of these, 98% have their

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

13

own web pages on Wikipedia, and of these 79% have a plot summary on the web page.
Coverage is better for more recent decades. Prewar decades may be especially incomplete,
but results do not suggest any discontinuities so the full annual results are reported here.
Analyses
Trends were analyzed with logistic regressions of working-class presence on the
year of newspaper publication or the year of the movie release. To compare working-class
recognition in the Times with regional newspapers, a simple dummy variable for the
regional newspaper and its interaction term with year are included. Year is centered at
2000 in these models so that the coefficient for the regional newspaper estimates the
difference in the two newspapers for that year. For these comparisons, the longer Times
data were limited to the years when digitized records were available from the regional
newspaper. More detailed analyses are presented graphing estimated probabilities for
each year from a regression that included dummy variables for each year.
All regressions include controls for the size of the text, measured as a cubic function
of the number of words in the text. Those three size coefficients are almost always
statistically significant: the longer the text the more likely a working-class job title is
included but to a declining degree. For newspapers, a control is also included for whether
the article appeared in the sports section. Athletes, referees, and coaches are, by Census
definition, professionals, so sports articles include on average more middle-class and fewer
working-class job titles. Sports articles are also a larger proportion of articles in regional
papers so this control corrects for that difference. Dummy variables are also included for
the day of the week, but these differences are far smaller than the controls for the length of
the article or the section of the paper. All predicted probabilities reported below include

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

14

controls for article length (estimated at 600 words for newspaper articles or 400 words for
movie plots), sports section, and the day of the week. Full results are available in the online
tables.
Results
New York Times
The fifty most common job titles in the Times are listed in Table 2. Except for the
general and somewhat ambiguous titles of “employee” (#21) and “worker” (#25), none are
from the working class. The highest ranking job title coded as working class is “chef”
(#137), and many of those titles are references to head chefs running a restaurant who are
more properly middle class. Next most common is #195 “secretary”, but a significant
minority of those are misclassified (lower case) references to Cabinet and corporate
secretaries (e.g., “Secretary of State” is #110). Even further down the list are “salesman”
(#223), “maid” (#246), and “mechanic” (#253).

On average since 1980, 24.1% of Times articles have mentioned a working-class job
title (29.4% if we include the more general, employee, code; but only 10.8% articles include

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

16

a blue-collar job title). These working-class job titles account for only 5.1% of all job titles
included in the Times. These frequencies are, as expected, far lower than for middle-class
occupations (90.0% of articles) or even upper-class occupations (40.1%).
The annual trend of working-class job titles in the Times, controlling for article
length, is negligible (β= +0.001, which could easily have occurred by chance). More
intensive measures of working-class recognition do sometimes show negative trends over
time, but they are still quite weak. For instance, articles with three or more mentions of a
working-class job title show a weak decline over time (β= –0.003, p<.10). Only the
mention of specifically manual, blue-collar occupations has declined noticeably over time
(β= −0.005). This translates to a predicted 1.6 percentage point drop (from 9.6% to 8.0%)
between 1980 and 2019 for a standard length article of 600 words.
Similarly, the recognition of the working class as a specific class category is low and
unchanging. This code is a composite of several phrases but mostly “working class” (61%)
and “blue collar” (31%). Only 1.4% of Times articles use one of these working-class labels.
This is less than the use of labels for the “middle class” (1.8% of articles) or for the “upper
class” (including “rich”, 7.1%) or for the “poor” (9.8%). Like working-class occupations, the
use of a working class label has been quite steady over time (β= +0.004 which is not
statistically significant).
In short, there is only weak evidence of any major decline in the Times recognition
of working-class occupations or a working-class label itself with a possible exception of the
subcategory of manual, blue-collar occupations. The Times’ recognition of the working

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

17

class is below that of middle-class or even upper-class occupations, but that has always
been true. There is little to suggest any recent changes.
St. Louis Post-Dispatch comparison
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has the longest digitized record of any mid-America
paper (from 1989) and provides an appropriate comparison for coverage of the working
class with that of the Times. The Post-Dispatch was the paper of the legendary Joseph
Pulitzer and remained in the Pulitzer family until 2005. It is now the only paper publishing
in the St. Louis metropolitan area.
The Post-Dispatch has had a generally higher inclusion of working-class job titles
than the Times (29.8% of articles annually vs. 23.8% for Times articles of similar lengths in
the same years), but that inclusion has declined so the year interaction comparing trends
with the Times (β= -0.014) is statistically significant. Other measures of inclusion of
working-class job titles (e.g., limiting the measure to manual, blue-collar job titles, counting
more intensive article with three or more mentions of working-class occupations) show a
similar pattern of higher recognition in the Post-Dispatch but declining over time.

Sample sizes: New York Times= 43,174; St .Louis Post-Dispatch= 28,002. Each logistic
regression includes controls for the day of the week, a cubic function of article length, and a
dummy variable for sports section. Year is centered at 2000, so, because of the interaction
term, the coefficient for “paper” (the St. Louis Post-Dispatch) represents the estimated
difference from The New York Times at that year.
Most other measures of working-class recognition show this same pattern of higher
but decreasing levels in the Post-Dispatch. The exception to this pattern is a named
“working class” in an article. While neither paper uses “working class” or its close affiliates
like “blue collar” very often, in the Post-Dispatch it is even less common (0.4% of articles)
than in the Times (0.8%). Like working-class job titles, a named working class is found
slightly less often in recent years in the Post-Dispatch (β= −0.020, p=.05), but not in the
Times (β= +0.005, n.s.). So, although for neither newspaper is there much use of working
class labels, it appears that the Times is more willing to discuss the working class in the
abstract – as a general category – but less often actual specific working-class jobs that
working-class readers might recognize. And while the Post-Dispatch began the period with
more recognition of working-class jobs, in recent years that recognition has declined to the
same low levels of the Times.
Figure 2 plots the decline in working-class job titles more precisely by estimating
each year separately. The decline is fairly steady after the turn of the century, and by the
end of the second decade of this century, the predicted probabilities are close to the low
level of the Times.

Comparisons with other regional newspapers
Two of the other three mid-America newspapers show much the same pattern as
the Post-Dispatch although the data cover fewer years (Table 4). The digitized record for
the Detroit News begins only in 1999, but the regression results are quite similar to the
St.Louis Post-Dispatch. In 1999, the predicted probability of including a working-class job

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

20

title was 31.8%, compared to 25.2% for the Times. It soon declined, however, and for the
latest year the Detroit News predicted probability (24.0%) was barely above the Times
(23.3%). The rate of decline (β= −0.020) is even steeper than for the Post-Dispatch,
perhaps because of the later initial year.

1. St. Louis Post-Dispatch

Note: See Table 1 for years and sample sizes of individual newspapers. All five logistic
regressions include controls for the day of the week, a cubic function of article length, and a
dummy variable for sports section. Year is centered at 2000 in each of the repressions, so,
because of the interaction term, the coefficient for the regional newspaper represents the
estimated difference from The New York Times at that year.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also shows a significantly higher proportion of articles
with a working-class job title in 2000 than does the Times , and the decline since 1993 (β=
−0.011) is steeper than for the Times. The St.Paul Pioneer Press is a partial exception to
these patterns. In 2000, the estimated proportion of articles with a working-class job title

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

21

(31.9%) is only slightly above (β= +0.085, p<.05) that for the Times (31.8%) and neither
the Pioneer Press nor the Times shows any consistent decline from 1995 to 2019.
The Tampa Bay Times shows a similar pattern to the St.Louis Post-Dispatch and the
other mid-America papers. The digitized texts date from 1987 (when it was the St.
Petersburg Times), and for the rest of that century the proportion of articles with a
working-class job title was consistently higher than for The New York Times. In 2000, an
estimated 31.9% of Tampa Bay Times articles included a working-class job title,
significantly more (β= +0.388) than the estimate for The New York Times (24.1%). But
working-class recognition declined over the period (β= −0.011).
The regression results for the regional newspapers confirm the “neglected”
hypotheses: the elite New York Times has paid less attention to working-class positions
than have the regional papers, but the regional papers have recently declined to levels not
far above the Times.
The linear year coefficients in the regressions of Tables 3 and 4 actually understate
the declining recognition of the working class. Figure 2 showed that the decline for the
St.Louis Post-Gazette was steeper in more recent years. That acceleration of the decline is
even more apparent for the other regional papers. Figure 3 plots the predicted annual
percentages of articles with a working-class job title for each of the other four regional
papers. For each paper, the decline accelerates or is only observed in the 21st century. The
decline for the Tampa Bay Times is especially steep. Even the St.Paul Pioneer Press, for
which the linear regression line was not statistically significant, shows a decline in
working-class recognition after the first decade of this century.

Movies
Wikipedia plot summaries are available for 18,056 U.S. produced movies from 1930
to 2018. The 50 most common job titles (Table 5) show many similarities and some
interesting differences with the list from the Times in Table 2. Not surprisingly, the police
are more prominent, including detective (#12), sheriff (#16), cop (#22), and police officer
(#24). The military is also more prominent, as are criminals and performers.

Capitalized job titles are counted only when capitalized in the text.

For our interest in working-class neglect, the general pattern is quite similar. Again,
the most common references are to the general, broad mentions of “employee” (#35) and
“worker” (#61). The movie list does include “secretary” (#42), but all the remaining job
titles are middle and upper class or police and criminals. Further down on the list (but
higher than for the Times) are “servant” (#59), “maid” (#67), “waitress” (#87), “bodyguard”
(#95), and “sailor” (#98),
Less than half (40.2%) of Wikipedia movie plot summaries include even a single
working-class job title, well below the percentage with a middle-class job title (81.0%).
Movies with a manual, blue-collar job titles are even less common (34.0%). The low
recognition of working class jobs in movies has declined since 1930 (β= −0.011), a
predicted fall from 54.2% of 1930 movies to 31.1% in 2018. Other definitions of workingclass occupations and other measures of incidence show similar negative trends (Table 6).

The 1930-2018 decline appears quite steady throughout this period for at least one
mention of a job title for the main working-class definition (see the top line in Figure 4 ).
Most other definitions of working-class occupations and other measures of recognition
show similar steady declines throughout this period. An interesting exception to the steady
declines is the decline for the more intensive working-class recognition (three mentions or
more in the plot summary). While also a generally negative trend (β= −0.013), there is a
noticeable resurgence at the end of the 1970s when movies such as Taxi Driver (1976),
Deer Hunter (1978), Norma Rae (1979), and 9 to 5 (1980) appeared (see the lower line in
Figure 4).

Discussion
The results for both newspapers and movies show a surprisingly clear confirmation
of the declining recognition of the working class in American popular culture. While three
of the four regional newspapers examined had once included substantially more workingclass content than did the elite press (as represented by the Times), that recognition is no
longer true for any of them. The decline in working-class recognition since the turn of the
century is striking in all four regional newspapers. And U.S. produced movies have shown
a steady decline of inclusion of working-class characters since 1930. The U.S. working class
may have always had reason to feel ignored by the elite New York Times, but by the time of

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

30

the 2016 election, that feeling of abandonment could well have extended to their local
papers as well. Hollywood, too, has steadily reduced their inclusion of the working class,
with a possible exception of a short period in the late 1970s.
How working-class Americans perceived this decline or whether this neglect played
a role in the Trump election is beyond the scope of this paper. The first step is to recognize
that cultural change has occurred and that in the news media at least it has historically
varied across the country. Cultural exclusion is, by itself, a cause for concern because it
contributes to inequality (Lamont 2018). Next, we might investigate possible
consequences; for example, were the regional declines in working-class recognition
correlated with the Trump vote in unexpected places?
If investigating consequences is a next step for these content analyses, we do not
have to look far for candidates that are possible causes for the cultural neglect. The decline
of working-class positions in the labor force is well documented. Using Current Population
Survey data from IPUMS with harmonized 2010 Census occupation codes (Flood et al.
2018) and with the same working-class definition used in the text mining analyses above
(but adjusting for the changing Census codes for occupations), the negative slope of
working-class occupations across time is as strong (β= −0.017) as for most of the cultural
indicators shown above. Working-class recognition may have declined in American
popular culture because the proportion of the working class in the American labor force
also declined.
Given the political prominence of the claim about working-class neglect, it might
seem surprising that there has been little attention paid to studies of this dimension of

“Neglected, Ignored, and Abandoned”? The Working Class in Popular U.S. Culture

31

cultural exclusion. Racial and gender exclusion from popular culture are more often
subjects of both academic and popular concern. And there is no equivalent dearth of
interpretive studies of how working-class characters are portrayed in movies, television,
and the popular culture. But the dimension of recognition versus neglect of the working
class has received little systematic study.
One answer for this failure may be a lack of adequate tools to evaluate class
presence and absence. Even simple content analyses of texts often depend on a search for a
particular phrase or a handful of equivalent phrases. But the presence or absence of
“working class” or “blue collar” exhibits the opposite pattern as the presence or absence of
actual working-class job titles. The more abstract descriptive phrases are more common in
the Times than in three of the four regional papers. And even in Wikipedia movie plot
summaries where those phrases are rare (0.7%), its use is slightly increasing over time (β=
+0.012), in contrast to the decline in actual working-class job titles (β= −0.011).
Having available a computer program that can code occupations from natural
language texts may be as important a contribution of this research as evaluating any
particular claim about popular culture and the working class in recent times. Occupations
are basic data for a wide variety of sociological research, well beyond issues of class
divisions. This initial program is a start, but more extensive use could result in
improvements to the program and, especially, to the lexicon of job titles and their
occupation codes.
The texts analyzed are, of course, only a small sample of U.S. popular culture. While
the availability of digitized texts has grown rapidly in recent years, and the growth of these

sources has contributed to the enthusiasm over text mining, easy access to long samples of
newspapers or other cultural produces remains a problem. The digitized Times corpus
only starts in 1980. While earlier editions are available from other sources, those records
are now stored as .pdf files. Translating those files to the raw text files needed for text
mining remains a major obstacle. The lack of texts from before 1980 is especially
frustrating because the movie texts show some intriguing evidence of a resurgence of
interest in the working class during the1970s that matches the earlier results for magazine
advertisements (Paulson and O’Guinn 2012).
The availability of regional newspapers is even more daunting. Most regional
newspapers have no digitized text archives and those that do date back a limited number of
years. Even compiling a representative sample of raw text articles for any of these papers
that do have digitized archives is a laborious task given the limitations imposed by the
existing archives. It is possible that similar analyses of other coastal and regional
newspapers would not support the patterns found here, but that is a task for future work
once more accessible archives become available.
Access to digitized movie plot summaries is far easier because of the work of
Wikipedia in collecting and producing them in a generally consistent format. Even here
substantial text cleaning is needed before analysis can begin. The main limitation for movie
plots is the dependence on Wikipedia which relies on volunteers for writing and editing
plot summaries. No other source is as comprehensive as Wikipedia, but a comparison with
even a limited number of movies plots from other sources – or, better, with a substantial
library of movie scripts – would be instructive. However, no comparison text archive is
readily accessible.

For now, another major limitation of these analyses of working-class neglect is the
restriction of the text analysis to the single dimension of recognition versus neglect. If a
newspaper or a movie includes a working-class character, there needs to be an analysis of
how that character is portrayed. The analyses above show whether a working-class
character is included or not, but we know nothing about what the newspaper or the movie
is saying about that character. The next step for text analyses of working-class exclusion
should be an exploration of the praise versus stigma dimension of cultural inclusion.
Beyond simple sentiment analyses, we need to inquire whether texts with workingclass characters include themes typically associated with working-class virtues: solidarity
(e.g., Deer Hunter), resistance (e.g., Norma Rae), and strong families (e.g., Marty) or with
typically working-class stigmas like violence (e.g., Taxi Driver) and crime (e.g., On the
Waterfront). While topic modeling might produce an inductive list of themes that could be
tracked over time (DiMaggio, Nag, and Blei 2013), the literature on working-class cultural
representation is sufficiently developed (e.g., Lamont 2000) that a more deductive set of
themes can be identified and coded using traditional content analysis procedures. These
coded texts should then provide the needed training set for developing a more automated
analysis of the much larger number of texts needed to track annual changes.
An era of sociological analyses of large text databases is surely coming (Bail 2014),
and it will change the discipline just as the arrival of large numerical databases did. The
two are not in opposition but can complement each other. If we are fortunate, text mining
could provide an intermediate line of research that bridges the gap between quantitative
social science and more interpretive studies of cultural change.
