Utterance Chunking in Instant Messaging: A Resource for Interaction Management
Modern organizations have an array of communication tools available for interacting
with both internal and external audiences. While email continues to dominate much workplace
interaction, the use of instant messaging (IM) continues to grow (Garrett & Danziger, 2007),
prompting scholars to look at how it is used in a variety of organizational contexts. In this
chapter, I first give a background on the research into IM use in organizations. I will then look at
IM as a form of conversation, and discuss why adopting a language-based approach to the study
of IM is useful for communication professionals. I illustrate this discussion with an examination
of one particular phenomenon, utterance chunking, in task-based IM interactions. Finally I will
conclude by discussing the implications of this research for business discourse and make some
suggestions for future research in this area.
Instant Messaging in Organizations
While email remains the dominant computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool in
most organizations (D'Urso & Pierce, 2009; Skovholt & Svennevig, 2013), IM is becoming more
important in a number of business settings, particularly in multinational organizations (Hunt,
2009; Yuan, Zhao, Liao, & Chi, 2013). One survey of MBA students in the United States found
that 53% worked in organizations that supported IM use (Glass & Li, 2010), while an industry
survey found that 84% of responding organizations used corporate-sanctioned, or enterprise, IM
(EIM) (Radicati & Hoang, 2011). A case study of one high tech organization found both email
and IM to be the dominant communication media, over both the phone and face-to-face (Turner,

Grube, Tinsley, Lee, & O’Pell, 2006). The differences in rates of IM usage noted across these
studies can be explained, in part, by the different organizational contexts. In particular, having a
critical mass of IM users in a workplace is one of the most important factors that influences
people’s decision to adopt the technology (Cameron & Webster, 2005). In other words, people
will be more likely to use IM when they perceive that enough of their colleagues are using the
technology. In cases where a critical mass of IM usage has not been achieved, however, other
factors can influence IM adoption, such as the influence of peers (To, Liao, Chiang, Shih, &
Chang, 2008). Similarly, organizational support was found to be a significant influence on
Chinese professionals’ use of IM at work (Ou & Davison, 2011).
Culture may also have an influence on what factors affect employees’ decisions to use IM
at work. For example, To et al. (2008) found that the perceived usefulness of IM was not an
influence on IM adoption among the Taiwanese professionals they surveyed, whereas Luo,
Gurung and Shim (2010) found perceived usefulness to be positively related to the use of IM in a
U.S.-based survey.
Affordances and Constraints of Workplace IM
IM has a number of advantages as a workplace communication tool. In particular, it
allows for near synchronous interaction, when all parties are logged in at the same time, but can
also serve as an asynchronous medium (see Darics, 2014). Used synchronously, IM allows for
easy coordination and collaboration, and the presence awareness systems built into most IM
platforms make it easy to tell when others are available and afford quick responses (Pazos,
Chung, & Micari, 2013; Quan-Haase, Cothrel, & Wellman, 2005; Shaw, Scheufele, & Catalano,
2007; Stephens, 2008). In addition to coordination, IM is frequently used for asking and
answering questions, information exchange, and other types of task discussion (Hung, Duyen,

Kong, & Chua, 2008; Luor, Wu, Lu, & Tao, 2010; Pazos et al., 2013; Quan-Haase et al., 2005).
Thomas and Akdere (2013) also argue that IM can be a beneficial tool for learning and training
in organizations. However, IM, despite its highly synchronous nature, may not be perceived as
being as effective for more ambiguous conversations, such as reaching understanding (Hung et
al., 2008). IM may also be perceived as affording more privacy when compared with the phone,
since IM conversations cannot be overheard (Cameron & Webster, 2005).
Several studies have examined the use of IM as a multitasking tool, and in particular,
how IM might serve as a source of interruptions in workflow or productivity. In their interview
with members of four different organizations, Cameron and Webster (2005) found that IM was
used for multitasking conversations, either by allowing a second channel of communication with
an existing conversational partner, or by allowing workers to carry on conversations with
multiple partners. IM was also used to “queue jump” to get the attention of a colleague who was
engaged in a conversation with a third party. Cameron and Webster’s interviewees had mixed
opinions on the interruptive nature of IM, with some respondents indicating that it could cause a
break in task focus, while others felt IM was less interruptive than other technologies, such as the
telephone. Interestingly, survey research from the United States has found that workplace IM
users reported being interrupted less frequently than non-users, and that IM did not contribute to
an increase in overall levels of work communication (Garrett & Danziger, 2007). Garrett and
Danziger argued that IM can be used as an interaction management tool, “allowing users to
create communication practices that minimize some types of interruption and negotiate the
timing of others” (p. 36). Licoppe’s (2010) qualitative analysis of IM use at work illustrated
some of these interaction management strategies and showed how they “constituted a situated,
artful accomplishment” (p. 300). Ou and Davison (2011) found that IM use contributed to work

interruptions, however it was not the only, nor the major, source of work interruptions for the
Chinese professionals they surveyed. In addition, Ou and Davison also found that IM use
contributed to a perception of improved communication quality, and interactivity, and led to an
increase in perceptions of mutual trust. IM interruptions do not necessarily lead to a reduction in
work quality, either. In a case study of administrative workers at a technical college in the U.S.,
Mansi and Levy (2013) found that accuracy on both simple and complex tasks was not affected
by IM interruptions. However, complex spatial tasks took longer to complete due to
interruptions, while symbolic tasks were not affected.
In addition to being used by individuals working alone, IM is also a tool that allows for
multitasking during group events, such as meetings, particularly when the norms of the
organization support the use of IM and other tools for extra-meeting communication (Dennis,
Rennecker, & Hansen, 2010; Stephens & Davis, 2009; Yuan et al., 2013). Dennis et al.’s
observations of two U.S.-based companies found that many IMs sent and received during
meetings were not related to the meeting at hand. Those that were, however, could have several
functions, including allowing interaction by others not present at the meeting, aiding in directing
the meeting, and serving as a clarification tool. In addition, Dennis et al. found that these IMs,
which they termed “invisible whispers,” could serve social support needs as well as task support
needs. However, using IM to multitask during meetings can lead to information overload
(Dennis et al., 2010).
Finally, researchers have also identified several personal benefits and drawbacks to
workplace IM users. Members of a global virtual team frequently chose IM over richer media
such as videoconferencing, as a way of maintaining work-life balance (Ruppel, Gong, &
Tworoger, 2013). The use of IM has been found to improve perceptions of working relationships

both within and between departments (Cho, Trier, & Kim, 2005). Quan-Haase et al. (2005)
found that IM was sometimes used to communicate with superiors about sensitive topics, such as
disagreements or difficult decisions. They argued that in the use of IM for these conversations
increases the social distance, making it easier for employees to communicate with their
supervisors. However, culture also plays a role in the relational benefits of IM, as Cho et al.
found the opposite in their study of IM use in a Korean company. The presence awareness
feature of IM, often seen as a benefit, can also cause strain in the workplace when people feel
pressured to be available (Turner et al., 2006) even to the point of working while on vacation
(Gibbs, Rozaidi, & Eisenberg, 2013).
Instant Messaging as Conversation
Research on computer-mediated conversation has documented how the structure of these
interactions varies from that of spoken conversation, due to the constraints and affordances of the
medium (e.g., Baron, 2010, 2013; Beisswenger, 2008; Darics, 2014; Jacobs & Garcia, 2013; Lee,
2007; Markman, 2009, 2013; Ong, 2011; Panyametheekul & Herring, 2003; Schonfeldt &
Golato, 2003). In particular, several researchers have noted that group chat conversations can
have problems with coherence, in part due to the inability to precisely time when messages arrive
in the chat room (Herring, 1999; Markman, 2013; Stromer-Galley & Martinson, 2009). Berglund
(2009) argued that many of the coherence issues associated with multi-party chat maybe
mitigated in IM due to the reduced number of participants, and thus this medium is worthy of
additional study. But despite a growing body of research on the impact of IM in the workplace,
very few studies examine discourse or linguistic elements in workplace IM conversations. A
language-based approach to the study of IM can help shed light on findings from previous
workplace research. For example, several studies have noted that IM is generally perceived to be

an informal communication channel (Cho et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2010; Quan-Haase et al., 2005;
Stephens, 2008; Yuan et al., 2013). Darics’ (2010) study of IM use among virtual team members
illustrates how that sense of informality can be achieved. Darics found that several orthographic
strategies, such as repeated letters, emoticons, and the use of all-capitals, along with various
politeness strategies adapted from spoken conversation fostered a sense of an informal workplace
and enhanced cooperation. Her study shows that by developing an understanding of how specific
linguistic strategies contribute to a sense of informality in IM, practitioners can begin to cultivate
a more mindful awareness of their own workplace IM use.
Cooper and Johnson (2014) compared the use of IM to audio for price negotiation
discussions. Although their research was conducted in a laboratory setting, the conditions were
designed to mimic the negotiations typically found on e-commerce sites. Overall they found that
critical comments had more impact in IM, making it less likely that the participants would reach
an agreement. Similarly, comments that threatened self-esteem increased the likelihood that
participants would fail to reach an agreement in their negotiations. Other discourse-based
research on workplace IM has examined how virtual team members use IM for both synchronous
and asynchronous interactions (Darics, 2014), and how professionals in highly connected
organizations use “quick questions” in IM conversations as a resource for collaborating on
knowledge-intensive tasks (Licoppe, Cudicio, & Proulx, 2014).
In the next section, I discuss a specific linguistic strategy frequently found in IM
conversations, utterance chunking, and provide an analysis of how this phenomenon is deployed
in persuasive, task-based IM conversations. Although the data examined here are not drawn from
a workplace context, research has shown that IM is sometimes used in organizations for solving
conflict, such as resolving a disagreement (Pazos et al., 2013). In addition, IM may be used for

persuasive interactions during e-commerce negotiations (Cooper & Johnson, 2014). Thus, we
can draw conclusions from the study of experimentally generated IM conversations that are
analogous to situations that might occur in workplace IM use.
Case Study: Utterance Chunking in Task-Based IM Conversations
What is utterance chunking? One linguistic feature of IM conversations that has been
found to be common in social IM is utterance chunking (Baron, 2010). Utterance chunking is
defined as the breaking down of “single utterances into several components, which are then
transmitted seriatim, rather than typing out the entire utterance and then transmitting it all of a
piece” (Baron, online). Utterance chunking has also been identified in business IM conversations
(Mackiewicz & Lam, 2009). Mackiewicz and Lam (2009) used a discourse analytic approach to
examine coherence in IM interaction between a director and her employee. They found that by
breaking up longer turns into shorter, rapidly sent transmissions, utterance chunking served as a
resource for providing coherence in workplace IM conversations.
The data examined below are drawn from two laboratory studies. The first examined IM
conversations between pairs that had no prior history (Strangers), while the second involved
pairs that had a prior relationship (Prior History). In the Strangers study, participants were asked
to persuade a research assistant to either adopt or reject a particular health-related policy. In the
Prior History study, participants were assigned to opposing sides of a printer use policy and
asked to persuade their partner of their side. In both studies, the persuasive tasks were similar to
types of conversations that might occur in a sales or negotiation setting in the workplace. The IM
transcripts were saved from all conversations and each participant’s computer screen was video
recorded, allowing the analysis of both the final record of each conversation along with a
moment-by-moment recording of how participants composed their IM transmissions.

In most commercially available IM systems, participants type their messages into a
composition box at the bottom of the IM window. Once the participant hits enter or clicks send,
the message is displayed in the main IM window. Unlike some very early dyadic CMC systems
(Anderson, Beard, & Walther, 2010), in IM the text typed into the composition box is typically
sent as a complete unit, rather than being displayed as it is being typed. Following Baron (2010)
I refer to this chunk of text as a transmission unit (TU). Utterance chunking occurs when a
complete grammatical unit, such as a sentence, is spread out over multiple TUs. Examples 1-4
illustrate common forms of utterance chunking.

The marked TUs in examples 1-3 illustrate how coordinating conjunctions can be used to
link multiple TUs into a single utterance. In examples 1 and two, ‘and’ is used to link the second
TU grammatically to the preceding TU, whereas in example 3 ‘but’ is the cue that links the two
TUs. It is also important to note that the presence of coordinating conjunctions does not de facto
indicate utterance chunking, as can be seen in the last line in example 3. Although here the
confederate starts her TU with ‘and,’ it is clear that here it indicates an additional thought in her
ongoing argument, rather than a grammatical connection to the preceding TUs, particularly given
that the last TU is phrased as a question, where as the preceding TUs were part of a statement of
opinion. In example 4 the subordinating conjunction ‘because’ acts similarly to the previous
examples by grammatically linking the two TUs.

Example 5 shows a slightly more complex use of conjunctions to mark utterance
chunking. While all of the TUs in this extract are from the same person, Participant 6, only the
three marked TUs are linked as a single utterance. The first of the three marked TUs is plausibly
complete, but the use of ‘or’ in the second TU and ‘if’ in the third grammatically link all three
TUs into the same sentence.

paid for all 500 up front
<M38A> if they were charge on a per page basis
<M38A> it would be a different story

Finally, example 6 illustrates another way that utterances can be broken in separate TUs.
In this extract, the TU at 13:50:20 is incomplete, as the ‘if’ clause needs a ‘then’ clause to finish
the sentence. Although the ‘then’ is only implied in the next TU, the clause provides
grammatical closure to the sentence and links the two TUs into a single utterance.
The previous examples have shown that one simple way to chunk an utterance over
multiple TUs is to end them at natural break points, such as conjunctions. This is seems to be the
most common way that utterance chunking is manifested in IM, in both these data and in
previous studies (Baron, 2010). Baron found that, after conjunctions, the next most common way
to chunk an utterance into multiple TUs was to start the second TU with an independent clause.
Less frequently found were breaks at adverbs and adverbial phrases, adjectives and adjectival
phrases, noun phrases, and verb phrases. Examples 7 and 8 show some of these additional ways
of chunking utterances.

Example 7 contains two instances of utterance chunking from different times in the same
conversation. The first sequence, from 12:20:34 to 12:20:54 consists of three TUs that form a
single utterance. Although the first TU in this sequence starts with ‘and,’ the period at the end of

the prior TU marks it as complete, and therefore the TU at 12:20:34 is the start of a new thought,
as in example 3 above. However, rather than break at the conjunction, this participant instead
breaks the TU at the prepositional phrase (for women), and then breaks at the conjunction ‘so’
for the third TU. In the second sequence, from 12:24:53 to 12:25:37, the first TU is an adjectival
phrase that, along with the comma, forecasts the continuation of this utterance, which is then
broken down into two subsequent TUs, broken at the more common point of the conjunction.

(2:24:03 PM) P15: well with some girls yes its to early but if they are
sexually active then they should otherwwise it shold be vountary. yes
they should have the decision to deside for themselves but its to help
the community. And the people around them.

Example 8 contains a combination of techniques, including a more idiosyncratic
formulation of utterance chunking. Based on the analysis of the screen recordings, the isolated ‘t’
at 2:21:15 appears to be an error. While composing the TU that is posted at 2:21:12, the
confederate types “I’m not saying I don;t t” and then backspaces to correct the typo. However, it
appears that she hit enter rather than the apostrophe (located next to each other on the keyboard)
and typed the t before noticing her mistake. She pauses briefly, deletes and retypes the ‘t’ and
hits enter, and then proceeds to type the TU that posts at 2:21:20. Thus it seems plausible that her
original intention was to break the utterance into three TUs (two independent clauses and a
dependent clause with coordinating conjunction), but having made a typing error instead breaks
the first TU in the middle of the verb phrase, a less natural place for a break to occur.

Thus far I have shown how utterance chunking in task-based conversations is typically
accomplished through breaking up utterances into multiple TUs that are linked grammatically.
These findings are consistent with the social IM conversations analyzed by Baron (2010). Baron
argues that utterance chunking in IM is a feature that makes it more similar to speech versus
formal writing. Indeed, Mackiewicz and Lam (2009) found that utterance chunking can be used
deliberately in workplace IM in order to cultivate a more speech-like, conversational style. For
practitioners, then, an understanding utterance chunking in IM offers an additional perspective
on why IM is often perceived as an informal communication channel, and can also contribute to
the development of a mindful awareness of IM style.
Utterance chunking as strategy: Holding the floor. It’s important to note that while
utterance chunking may often be a naturally occurring feature of IM conversation, it can also be
used purposefully. Mackiewicz and Lam (2009) found that utterance chunking was frequently
used strategically in the IM conversations they studied. In particular, they found that the director
acknowledged that she often chunked her utterances as an attempt to hold the conversational
floor. In CMC, a conversational floor is more than just who is taking a turn at talk, in part
because IM systems allow participants to type and send whenever they want. Instead, the floor is
the sense of what the conversation is about, including the topic and the overall speech activity
(such as explaining, chatting, arguing, etc.) (Simpson, 2005, 2013). Simpson noted that
participants work together to produce the conversational floor in CMC, and that floors can be
monologic, where one participant dominates (called the speaker-and-supporter floor), or
collaborative. However, in persuasive or negotiation-type situations, such as the ones being
examined here, participants may be particularly motivated to gain and hold the floor in order to

garner support for their ideas. Examples 9-12 illustrate different ways that utterance chunking
can be used towards this end.

s of paper espiesally for the commuters.

In Example 9 the first two marked TUs appear to be a typo, similar to example 8 above.
The screen recordings reveal that this participant first types “Dont” then backspaces to delete the
‘t,’ but again hits enter instead of the apostrophe. However, the pacing of his typing in this
excerpt suggests that the rest of this utterance was deliberately spread over the next two TUs. By
making each TU a single word, he is adding visual force to his argument, by occupying more
vertical space in the IM window. In addition, most modern IM systems have some type of
conversational monitoring element built in to them, which alerts the one partner when the other
is composing a transmission. By sending shorter TUs in rapid succession, IM participants are
potentially able to exploit this technical feature by announcing their intention to continue,
thereby adding to the visual dimension and increasing their chances of holding the floor. In fact,
it is possible that typing longer utterances in lieu of chunking them into shorter TUs may work
against floor holding, despite the conversational monitoring features, as is illustrated in example
10.

can just go and print somewhere else such as thier home
[11:10:08] <F4> when you order clothes offline ... you have to do that too

Analysis of the screen recordings reveals that immediately after M4’s TU posts at
11:09:30, the conversational monitor (in this system located at the top of the IM window next to
the IM partner’s screen name) indicates that he is continuing to type. After waiting for 19
seconds, F4 begins typing in her composition box, even though the IM window indicates that her
partner is still composing a message. Her two TUs at 11:09:54 and 11:09:56 are plausibly
interpretable as a single utterance, broken up (and with the addition of all capital letters) as a way
of getting the attention of her partner. In fact, she starts typing the post at 11:10:08 just four
seconds after sending her previous TU, even though her partner is still typing. It is of course
impossible to know if the outcome would have been different had M4 chunked his utterance into
multiple TUs, but this example does show that typing longer TUs may be dis-preferred by some
IM partners, and therefore it may be advantageous to be more deliberate about the use of
utterance chunking.
The last two examples show how utterance chunking can add rhetorical force to the
visual force achieved by sending multiple, short TUs in rapid succession.

In example 11, F13A’s first TU is a direct response to the prior turn by her partner. She
then continues to type a series of modifying phrases that function to upgrade each prior TU with
a stronger statement. In doing so, she not only gains the visual force of multiple TUs, but she
adds rhetorical power to her argument by adding emphasis in each successive chunk. The screen
recordings indicate that participant F13B started typing her next message before her partner’s TU
posted at 12:12:40, but that she pauses for several seconds after the TUs at 12:12:45 and
12:12:47 post, which may indicate that this use of utterance chunking was successful at least
momentarily garnering attention. In example 12, participant F3B accomplishes something similar
through the use of additional examples to extend her utterance. Based on an analysis of the
screen recordings, the utterance chunked across TUs 14:43:18 to 14:43:31 was most likely a
response to her partner’s TU at 14:42:56, rather than to the immediately preceding TU.
Participant F3B has already started typing her TU at 14:43:10 when the previous message posts.
After she finishes typing, she pauses for seven seconds before hitting enter, and then
immediately starts typing the TU that gets posted at 14:43:18. This suggests that she was reading
the post that “interrupted” hers, and that her next TU is a rebuttal to her partner’s argument. She
is able to rhetorically extend her argument and hold the floor by quickly composing a series of
short TUs to provide additional examples. Once again, the screen recordings show that she may
have been at least partially successful, in that her partner did not start typing again until after the
TU at 14:43:25 had posted (although the conversation monitor indicated that F3B was still
composing).
Discussion: Utterance Chunking and Interaction Management in Workplace IM

The growing body of research on workplace IM demonstrates the importance of this
medium to 21st century businesses. The numerous surveys of IM usage have helped to clarify
how widespread IM usage is, the factors that influence IM adoption, and the various tasks that
are accomplished through communication in this medium. In addition, research on IM
interruptions has generally shown the medium to be a help, rather than a hindrance, to
productivity. What is missing from this literature, however, is a critical mass of studies that
examine in-depth the discursive features and functions of workplace IM conversations. The
analysis presented in this chapter has been one attempt to fill that gap, but is limited in scope by
being drawn from lab-based task discussions, rather than bona-fide workplace interactions.
However, other research on IM shows that the particular linguistic phenomenon discussed here,
utterance chunking, does occur in business settings (Mackiewicz & Lam, 2009). In addition, the
persuasive nature of the conversations presented here are analogous to some types of workplace
IM discourse (Cooper & Johnson, 2014; Pazos et al., 2013). It is therefore useful to discuss how
insights from this analysis can be applied to business communication settings.
By using a qualitative, micro-analytic perspective, I have illustrated both how utterance
chunking is typically formulated in IM conversations, and also how it might serve as a means of
managing interaction. In particular, utterance chunking can be used strategically in business
settings to cultivate a more informal style, which could be useful in a variety of settings. For
example, researchers and industry watchers have noted a rise in the use of chat for providing
online customer support ("Can I help the next customer…online?," 2006; Klie, 2012; Sarrel,
2007). Communication professionals could incorporate a discussion of utterance chunking into
training materials for online customer support staff. By understanding how to make their IM
conversations seem more natural and friendly, online customer service workers could help

increase customer trust. In organizations that value friendliness and informality as part of the
culture, understanding utterance chunking could help employees make their IM conversations
conform to that norm (see also Darics, 2010). In addition, utterance chunking can be used in IM
conversations between coworkers as a way of lowering the social distance between interlocutors
in order to broach disagreements or conflicts. However, in cultural contexts where maintaining
formality is important, developing a more mindful awareness of IM construction, and
particularly an awareness of utterance chunking, may help participants avoid the practice when
informality is not desired. Utterance chunking may also increase the perception of interactivity in
IM conversations, which can in turn lead to an increase in mutual trust in the workplace (Ou &
Davison, 2011). Professionals who are multitasking and maintaining multiple simultaneous
conversations may also want to strategically avoid utterance chunking, because it could cause
miscommunications if people are not paying close attention to the IM conversation.
In this chapter I have also shown that utterance chunking serves as a way for IM
participants to try to hold the floor, and potentially make their contributions to the conversation
more noticeable. Floor-holding can be a way of signaling power or status in other types of CMC
(Herring, 2010; Simpson, 2005), and one study of workplace IM use has demonstrated that
supervisors may use utterance chunking strategically to hold the floor in conversations with their
employees (Mackiewicz & Lam, 2009). However, supervisors who are trying to build more
collaborative relationships with their employees may want to consider avoiding utterance
chunking in IM conversations when it might be perceived as dominating the conversation.
Finally, while this research focused on persuasive task conversations, utterance chunking
may also be useful in other types of task conversations that IM is typically used for in
organizations. Using utterance chunking to break down complex information into bite-sized

pieces, for example, may help make IM a more suitable medium for explaining processes, giving
directions, or other ambiguous tasks. Overall, by being mindful of how IM conversations are
constructed, practitioners can help employees maximize the usefulness of this important
workplace communication technology.
Conclusion
In this chapter I have shown that IM continues to be an important communication tool in
21st century organizations. However, despite the overall increase in research on workplace IM,
relatively few of those studies take a discourse-based approach. I have shown that, through a
close analysis of the discursive features of IM, scholars can contribute to both the literature and
to the needs of practitioners by helping professionals become more mindful about the way they
manage their IM interactions. Scholars of business discourse should look to the research on
email discourse in the workplace (e.g. Hössjer, 2013; Skovholt & Svennevig, 2006, 2013;
Turnage, 2013; Waldvogel, 2007) as a jumping off point for future studies of IM. Such research
would also allow a comparison to the research on social IM (e.g. Baron, 2010; Berglund, 2009;
Ling & Baron, 2007; Tagliamonte & Denis, 2008), in order to further our understanding of
which aspects of IM discourse may be more universal, and which are context dependent.
