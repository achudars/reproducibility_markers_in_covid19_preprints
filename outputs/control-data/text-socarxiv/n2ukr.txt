Abstract
Even after undertaking years of formal education to acquire the language in schools, having a poor
command of English remains a problem faced by most Malaysians, especially students in rural
schools of Sarawak. Based on the error-analysis carried out by recent research, subject–verb
agreement (SVA) is one of the most frequent errors committed by students. To overcome this
problem, teachers should significantly improve students’ mastery of SVA in the English language
through effective teaching methods. Therefore, this research was conducted to explore the effects
of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in teaching SVA among rural Sarawak learners. In this
study, 35 Form 4 students were selected from a secondary school in the Belaga District, Sarawak
as the research participants. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used as data
collection tools. Overall, findings demonstrated that students showed positive feedback after the
intervention was implemented. Results of this research will hopefully provide insights to
secondary school students, teachers and the community in the cooperative teaching and learning
of grammar.

The Effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in Teaching

Chong & Yunus

1.0 Introduction
After Mandarin and Spanish, the English language has the third largest number of native speakers,
approximately 378 million worldwide (Simons & Charles, 2018). English language is often
referred to as the lingua franca of the modern world given its usage as the dominant language in
international affairs, especially in the prospects of science and technology (House, 2014;
Thirusanku & Yunus, 2012). In Malaysia, apart from the Malay language as the national language
of the country, the second most important language is English; such ranking is explained by the
latter being broadly used in various fields, such as business, medicine, engineering and so on
(Abdullah, Rahman & Lina, 2010). Although the Malaysian Education system has emphasised the
significance of English teaching and learning in schools, poor English proficiency among fresh
graduates has been one of the top concerns faced by Malaysian employers (Ministry of Education,
2012). Since 1970, the English language proficiency among Malaysians has not shown
considerable improvement (Yunus & Saiful, 2017).
Literature is essential to guarantee students’ personal growth and contributions to society
(Ien, Yunus & Embi, 2017). However, unsatisfactory results remain despite efforts to elevate the
students’ performance in English. Many students continue facing difficulties, especially in writing
simple grammatical sentences. After years of studying the English language from primary to
secondary education, students still tend to make repeated mistakes in dealing with the subject and
verb agreement (SVA) patterns in writing their sentences owing to a lack of interest and exposure
in using the language (Nurjanah, 2017). Hence, incorporating a strategy, such as the Kagan
cooperative learning structures in the English lesson, is hoped to facilitate students’ enhanced
grammar skills, especially in mastering the SVA pattern.
Unlike the traditional English classrooms, which practise teacher-centred learning,
cooperative learning allows autonomy among learners. In the latter, learners can monitor their own
learning and could seize the opportunity to express themselves with their peers as well as the
teacher who assumes the facilitator role (Schineke-Llano, 1983). In addition, learners’ proficiency
in the English language can be improved through collaborative learning (Kwan & Yunus, 2014).
Hence, conducting cooperative learning is relevant in a language classroom as students are trained
to communicate and share ideas with other learners in the language learning process inside and
outside the classroom (Oxford, 1990; Littlewood, 1992). Yunus (2018) asserted that ineffective
conventional methods should be replaced, and educators should attempt to make a difference.
Thus, this study aimed to fill the research gap by exploring the effects of Kagan cooperative
learning structures in teaching SVA among rural Sarawak learners. This study intends to address
the following research questions:
1. What are the students’ perceptions regarding the use of Kagan Structures in their mastery of
SVA patterns?
2. What challenges do the students face whilst using Kagan Structures in their mastery of SVA
patterns?

The Effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in Teaching

Chong & Yunus

2.0 Literature Review
2.1 Cooperative Learning
As described by Kagan (1994), cooperative learning is a type of active learning students tackle in
small groups to complete specific tasks assigned by the teacher. Correspondingly, Azizineshad et
al. (2013) defined cooperative learning as a system of teaching and learning techniques. In the
process of learning, students are active agents instead of passive receivers of the product of any
given knowledge. Rewards or recognition will be given to boost students’ motivation to learn when
they successfully complete an assigned task.
The current educational system advocates learning models, which allow students to convey
and express their opinions and views in a social context as it is significant to restructure their
knowledge when learning is a major part of life. The main agenda of these learning models in
education is enabling students to recognise their potential and enhance knowledge acquisition by
comparing their schemata with the newly absorbed information (Ozden, 2004). As discovered by
recent research, the most effective state to acquire knowledge is when a learner is aware of his
needs and acts autonomously in his own learning. He should also independently identify his own
learning strategies. In short, effective learning occurs when the learner is actively engaged in the
process of knowledge acquisition.
Unlike traditional group tasks, cooperative learning emphasises on the principles of
positive interdependence and individual responsibility. The idea of group achievement being more
significant than individual achievement is instilled in every group member as students in a group
exert efforts towards a shared goal (Johnson & Johnson, 1999). Members in a group must assist,
support and encourage one another to achieve their learning target, thereby allowing everyone to
contribute to the task whilst simultaneously being motivated to learn (Johnson, Johnson & Smith,
1991).
Olsen and Kagan (1992) and Johnson and Johnson (1999) described cooperative learning
as a series of prepared group learning activities, making learning dependent on the socially
structured exchange of information between learners in groups. Each learner is accountable for his
or her own learning and is motivated to increase the learning of others. Therefore, numerous
studies have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of cooperative learning and have
consequently obtained positive outcomes. Koppenhaver and Shrader (2003) claimed that
cooperative learning increases the level of understanding and reasoning. At the same time, it
develops critical thinking as well as increase the accuracy of long-term retention. Through
cooperative learning, active participation in learning is believed to be promoted and thus lead to
improved academic achievement (Panitz, 1996).
Different scholars may have their own respective definitions of cooperative learning.
However, cooperative learning generally involves students working together or cooperating in
small groups. They are responsible for their own as well as others’ learning. Teachers act as a
facilitator in a cooperative learning classroom whilst students become active learners. Cooperative
learning aims to maximise the students’ learning through the social support they obtained from
their group members (Slavin, 1989).

The Effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in Teaching

Chong & Yunus

2.2 Benefits of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures
Various advantages of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures are identified via research (Kagan,
1995; Kagan & McGroarty, 1993). Firstly, Kagan Structures allow students to gain substantial
comprehensible input. This target is achieved as students adjust their speech to the level of their
partner because they are working together as a team. Secondly, learning is conducted in a natural
context. In a real-life scenario, language is used for functional interaction. Thirdly, negotiation of
meaning takes place to ensure that students comprehend one another. Students have the
opportunity to alter or modify their language output. Fourth, the affective filter is lowered. Students
who are often frightened to speak in front of the whole class no longer have to feel that way.
Instead of talking to the crowd, students talk with a supportive teammate. Fifth, peer support is
present. When completing a task using Kagan Structures, students are encouraged to assist and
support one another in a team. Sixth, motivation in learning is enhanced because the structures are
engaging interaction sequences. Lastly, Kagan Structures promote greater language use.
Apart from the aforementioned benefits of Kagan Cooperative Structures, recent research
also proved that these structures can increase students’ learning outcome. In an action research
conducted by Yusri, Mantasiah and Jufri (2018) entitled The Use of Two Stray Model in English
Teaching to Increase Student’s Learning Outcome, one of the Kagan Cooperative Learning
Structures was implemented. To investigate the effects of Two Stay and Two Stray (TS-TS) in
English learning, data were collected through observation, tests and questionnaires. Accordingly,
the use of TS-TS Cooperative Learning Structure increased student’s learning outcome in English
learning. Notably, cooperative learning structures produced active learners in the classroom as the
social interaction between learners was present and teamwork was fostered.
Another action research was employed to improve the students’ reading ability through
Numbered Heads Together (NHT), which is also one of the Kagan Cooperative Learning
Structures. Fanolong et al. (2016) selected a classroom of secondary students from SMA Negeri
Wawalesi as the research participants; they found that NHT was successful in improving students’
reading ability as an increment in students’ mean reading scores was observed. Students’ mean
reading score has increased from 65% in the first test to 80.3% in the second test. The finding also
indicated that NHT technique was effective in enhancing the students’ participation because
students willingly raised their hands to answer the questions during the answer-checking session.
Sabbah (2016) used a quasi-experimental research design to investigate the effect of using
jigsaw cooperative strategy, a Kagan cooperative learning structure, on ESL students’ achievement
in reading comprehension. The participants were female students enrolled in Level 4 reading
classes in the Foundation Program of the Community College of Qatar during the fourth quarter
of AY 2013–2014. The statistical analysis of the acquired data showed a positive effect of jigsaw
strategy on ESL students’ reading achievement.
3.0 Methodology
3.1 Research Design
This study employed the mixed-method research design, which involved both qualitative and
quantitative research methodologies in the process of data collection and data analysis. It was
divided into two parts to answer the two research questions. The first part of this study focused on

quantitative method. Survey questionnaires were administered to obtain the students’ perceptions
on the use of Kagan Structures in their mastery of SVA patterns, thereby answering the first
research question. The survey method was suitable for a large sample administered within a limited
time, and generalisation can be done. The results from the questionnaires were then described in
the form of descriptive statistics.
The second part of this study applied the qualitative method, using semi-structured
interviews to gather data, and subsequently discovered the challenges faced by the students whilst
using Kagan Structures in their mastery of subject–verb agreement. The interview sessions were
recorded and analysed using thematic analysis.
3.2 Research Population
The participants for this study were from a secondary school in Belaga District, Sarawak. The
research objective is to explore the effects of Kagan Structures on rural Sarawak students’ mastery
in subject–verb agreement. The research participants selected for this study were based on
purposive sampling. They were chosen on the basis of the predetermined characteristics extracted
from the requirement of the study. The participants were from different socio-economic
backgrounds but of similar language background as they were non-native speakers of the English
language.
3.3 Research Instruments
Two instruments were constructed to collect the required data. The instruments for this study
comprised a survey questionnaire on the students’ perceptions of cooperative learning and a semistructured interview.
The survey questionnaires aimed to identify the students’ perceptions on the Kagan
structures implemented. After the implementation of Kagan structures in the classroom, a set of
questionnaire was given to the participants. The questionnaire which was adapted from Hung et
al. (2010) consisted of 20 items on a four-point Likert scale from ‘strongly agree’, ‘agree’,
‘disagree’ to ‘strongly disagree’. It discovered the students’ perceptions on the use of cooperative
learning in learning English.
Interview sessions were conducted individually with the selected participants. Five
participants were randomly selected to be interviewed using the hat and draw method to offer all
participants an equal chance to be selected for the interview. The five interview questions focused
on the challenges students’ face whilst using Kagan Structures in their mastery of SVA patterns.
4.0 Findings and Discussion
4.1 Students’ Perception on the Use of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures
After the participants were exposed to the lessons conducted using Kagan Cooperative Learning
Structures, participants were instructed to complete a set of questionnaire. This questionnaire was
divided into two sections, namely, Section A: Respondent’s background and Section B: Students’
perceptions on Kagan structures. The data collected from Section B of the questionnaire were
analysed using frequency and percentages. Table 1 displays the participants’ responses based on
the questionnaire.

Epraim

I like it because it’s fun. We can… there are games so that we can
play while learning. It helps me in learning.

Fiviana

Yes, I would like it because we get to share our knowledge. There
are some of us who are better in English while some of us who are
weak. Those who understand the lesson can help those who don’t.

Lydia

I like it because if I am to do the task alone, I don’t feel confident.
In a group activity, I have friends with me. I feel more confident
that way and I feel braver to answer all the questions asked by the
teacher.

Sally

I don’t really prefer the activities because I feel shy to work with
the others. I feel shy talking to people. I prefer a normal classroom
lesson because I feel more comfortable.

Jacqueline

Yes, I like it because I’m able to understand the lesson better
when we share and learn together as a group. I would not be able
to achieve that if I study alone.

My favourite game was when we traded the yellow cards with
each other because it’s fun to exchange cards and seek for our
partners.

Fiviana

The activity which requires us to search for a partner because it is
challenging. We were using the SVA formula and some of us were
still confused. Some of us found the wrong partner as we did not
match it properly following the rule of the formula.

Lydia

I like Flashcard game the most because if I get it wrong, my
partner can correct me and I don’t feel shy or embarrassed.

My favourite is the Flashcard game so that we learn to identify
subject and verb.

Jacqueline

Mix-N-Match because we get to apply what we have learnt and
involves movement.

The Effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in Teaching

Chong & Yunus

Based on the findings in Table 1, most of the participants can be observed to display
positive responses on the use of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in teaching subject–verb
agreement. For example, 5 out of 20 items of the questionnaire achieved a 100% agreement. These
items were Item B3 ‘In small group learning, I feel learning English is more effective whenever I
help my friends’, Item B6 ‘Learning in a small group enhances my motivation towards learning
English’, Item B8 ‘I consider that learning in a small group is interesting and makes learning
enjoyable’, Item B9 ‘Hereafter, I hope to keep learning in small groups in the English classes’
and Item B16 ‘I think small group tasks help everyone learn to be responsible for our own learning
and motivate us to study hard’. Mahmoud and Mohamed (2014) reinforced the finding that
students show positive attitudes towards the use of cooperative learning approach in developing
language skills.
The interview responses supported the above statements, given that an increased
motivation to learn can be observed in the respondent’s (Epraim) expressed feelings towards the
use of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures. He stated that ‘I like it because it’s fun. We can…
there are games so that we can play whilst learning. It helps me in learning’. Purnomo (2015) has
also concluded that Kagan structures not only enhance students’ motivation towards learning but
also lead to positive social behaviours because fun learning and healthy competition are promoted.
If students enjoy whilst studying, it will directly contribute to a better academic achievement. Both
students’ motivation and confidence level to respond to questions were improved as Lydia
mentioned the following: ‘I like it because if I am to do the task alone, I don’t feel confident. In a
group activity, I have friends with me. I feel more confident that way, and I feel braver to answer
all the questions asked by the teacher’.
In addition, the highest number of participants (71.4%) agreed with Item B10 ‘I have more
opportunities to practise English in small group learning’, whilst 25.7% strongly agreed to the
same statement. This finding is implied when Lydia described that when Timed Pair Share was
conducted, ‘everyone was speaking English’, thus providing other opportunities for students to
practise the target language. The second highest is Item B11 ‘My group members perform well in
small group learning’, with 62.9% of the participants agreeing to such statement. Although the
amount of noise produced in a cooperative learning classroom may be a concern to certain teachers
and students, the result in the questionnaire showed that 54.4% of the participants disagreed with
Item B12 ‘The noise of group discussions would affect me in learning English’. Thus, the noise
may not be an issue to a majority of the students in a cooperative learning environment.
Among all 20 items, 54.3% of the participants strongly agreed with Item B5 ‘Learning in
a small group helps me learn English better’, Item B14 ‘In a small group, I learned how to get
along with classmates, interact and cooperate with them and develop my social skills’ and Item
B18 ‘It is good that students with different levels are assigned to a small group because higherlevel students could help other students in learning English’. This idea is also seen in Jacqueline’s
response when she expressed her appreciation concerning the implementation of Kagan
Cooperative Learning Structures because ‘(she is) able to understand the lesson better when (they)
share and learn together as a group. (She) would not be able to achieve that if (she studies) alone’.
Yusri, Mantasiah and Jufri (2018) also mentioned that the social interactions among students can
nurture students in becoming active learners whilst simultaneously fostering teamwork.

Chong & Yunus

Fiviana’s response was also on par with Item B18 ‘there are some of us who are better in
English whilst some of us who are weak. Those who understand the lesson can help those who
don’t’. Hence, the students can be concluded to prefer learning SVA of the English language in a
small group using Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures as the positive feedback outweighs the
challenges.
4.2 Challenges of Using Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures
Despite the positive responses from the students obtained in the questionnaire and the interview, a
part of the interview responses continued displaying some of the students’ encountered difficulties
and challenges in learning English via the Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures. Hence,
analysing the data collected is needed to identify the challenges faced by the students. Tables 4
and 5 illustrated participants’ interview responses based on Questions 3 and 4, respectively.
According to the analysis of data, the challenges identified can be divided into four main themes,
namely, 1) Lack of Communication Skills, 2) Burdening Tasks, 3) Noise Distraction and 4) Passive
Teammates.
Table 4. Participants’ Interview Responses (Question 3).

Participant

What are
your least
favourite
activities
during the
lesson? Why
don’t you
like them?

Epraim

I don’t like the last game that we played. The paper that you gave
me that had six pictures on it. Because we need to construct
words so my teammates they doesn’t know how to do it so I need
to help them while I need to think for my own answer so that
makes me busy. It feels like a lot of burdens.

Fiviana

The one which we need to produce a paragraph because the
group is not active. My friends… did not participate. They did not
give any opinion and they did not help to construct the sentences.
I asked for their help but they just kept quiet.

Lydia

The first activity, Timed Pair Share, because we need to teach our
friends about what we have learnt. Because everyone was
speaking English, I find it hard to communicate with them. I tried
to speak in English but my English is broken.

Sally

The activity which requires us to find the correct match. It is MixN-Match. It’s hard to understand and I don’t feel comfortable
because it involved too many people. I feel too shy to find the
correct partner.

Jacqueline

The writing activity because I’m not really good at writing and it’s
challenging to translate from Malay to English. My friends helped
me but there were also other words they did not know how to
translate.

Interview Response

Epraim

When I don’t know the person, I need to have courage to talk to
them. That is also another challenge to me.

Fiviana

It’s noisy because discussions are carried out. It is especially noisy
during the activity which requires us to match with the correct
partner.

Lydia

Difficulty to communicate with the others. I feel afraid to speak in
English because I’m afraid of making mistakes. It’s not because of
my friends. I, myself, feel afraid and shy to ask.

Sally

(Described in Q4)

Jacqueline

I also have problem interacting with my friends because I’m not
confident to speak in English.

4.2.1 Lack of Communication Skills
4 out of 5 participants indicated that Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures involved several
interactions among students and caused discomfort at a certain point. When the participants were
asked to state the challenges they faced, Epraim stated that he had difficulties communicating with
his teammates because he was not comfortable with them at that time. Consequently, he was
compelled to muster the courage in starting a conversation and completing the tasks assigned by
the teacher. Lydia experienced the same situation when Timed Pair Share was conducted. All
participants were required to take turns and share regarding what they had learnt in the lesson with
their friends in the classroom. She felt inferior communicating with her friends, especially when
she needed to converse in the English language because she could not speak proper English.
Moreover, she was afraid to make mistakes in front of her friends. Similarly, Jacqueline also had
problems interacting with her friends because she lacked confidence in speaking English.
The same thing happened to Sally. In the activity Mix-N-Match, Sally felt uncomfortable
because the activity involved all 35 participants. Apart from being too shy to participate, Sally
further explained that she was someone who preferred to study alone than in a small group. This
idea is also portrayed in Item B19 ‘I prefer learning in a small group rather than learning
individually, I think I am pretty good at this game’. One of the participants disagreed with the
statement, which indicated that she was not fond of learning in a small group. Thus, the lack of
communication and social skills is one of the main barriers the students must overcome in a
cooperative learning classroom.
4.2.2 Burdening Task
Apart from the lack of communication skills, two of the participants raised the issue regarding the
presence of burdening tasks. When asked about the least favourite activity, Epraim mentioned that
he disliked the writing activity, which involved one of the Kagan Structures, Flying Carpet. He

The Effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in Teaching

considered helping his friends whilst simultaneously having to complete his part of the task a
burden. Jacqueline’s least favourite activity was also writing because it was her weakness, and
translating from Malay to English was challenging for her. Although her friends actually attempted
to help her, her friends had their limitations as well.
4.2.3 Noise Distraction
As expected in a cooperative learning classroom, noise is inevitable as discussions are constantly
carried out among students to share their views on a certain topic or an assignment. The classroom
environment was slightly noisy to Fiviana, especially when it involved activities, such as Timed
Pair Share and Mix-N-Match. The latter involved several movements from the students in the
classroom. However, noise may not be a major shortcoming of cooperative learning as most of the
students did not see it as a threat.
4.2.4 Passive Teammates
Another challenge pointed out by one of the participants, Fiviana, is having passive teammates.
She described her experience in the writing activity in which the students were required to produce
a paragraph with the correct usage of subject–verb agreement. During the activity, her teammates
were not actively participating. They did not contribute any opinion and did not help construct
sentences as well. She added that even after she asked for her teammates’ assistance, most of them
only remained silent. This scenario is also shown in Item B15 ‘There are classmates who seldom
participate in a group discussion or learning, and this affects my learning as well’, with 74.28%
of the participants agreeing to such statement.
5.0 Conclusion and Implications
This study investigated the effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in teaching subject–
verb agreement. Accordingly, the findings provide a better understanding of how these structures
work as well as their effects towards language learning. Based on the findings, Kagan Cooperative
Learning Structures are beneficial to students because they can improve the students’ language
skills. As shown in the findings, they have significant effects on the students’ SVA test
achievement. Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures can also promote students’ teamwork and
interpersonal skills as students are required to communicate and discuss with one another to solve
problems or complete the tasks assigned. Every team member plays an important part in the
learning process.
Undoubtedly, this study will benefit English teachers who are teaching either in primary or
secondary schools. Considering that the study took place in a rural district of Sarawak and involved
participants who were studying in a rural school, this study suitably serves as an example for
further consideration. The lack of amenities and poor Internet connection have constantly been a
problem for teachers who are teaching in the rural area. Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures
can be utilised to overcome this problem as these structures require no substantial amenities to
conduct an engaging lesson.
Moreover, educators are constantly searching for effective teaching methods and
approaches to enhance students’ learning. The findings of this study have shown that Kagan
Cooperative Learning Structures can be proposed as one of the effective teaching methods for

teachers. An interactive learning environment is created through the use of these structures.
Specific steps or procedures in conducting the structures can be easily obtained and integrated into
the lesson at any point in time. Hence, it can lessen the teachers’ burden as time spent on lesson
planning can be reduced.
Both school teachers and educators at the tertiary level can benefit from this study.
Employing cooperative learning in colleges and universities is highly suitable, especially during
tutorials. As tertiary education involves mostly adults, they should be afforded with extra
autonomy in their own learning. Using Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures is relevant because
lecturers will only act as facilitators to monitor the students’ learning.
Based on the findings, Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures, as described in this study,
evidently provided positive effects on the acquisition of various language skills. Positive attitude
towards the learning of the English language is also promoted through these structures. Therefore,
cooperative learning is seen as a viable option for educators to deliver English lesson to among
students. However, the results of this study cannot be generalised given its limitations.
