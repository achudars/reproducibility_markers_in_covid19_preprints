Innovation Risk and Sustainable Competitive Advantages: Empirical Assessment of
Government-Linked Companies in Malaysia
Abstract
This study attempts to assess the present level of innovation status among Malaysian
Government-Linked Companies (GLCs). A set of questionnaire was distributed among 134
managers and executives from these GLCs to collect the primary data for this study. The
perspectives of executives were collected based on ten factors of innovation practices
utilizing the five-point Likert scales. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data while
the reliability and validity were tested using the Cronbach’s alpha test and the Skewness and
Kurtosis test, respectively. Factor analysis was used to test the data consistency. The findings
revealed the 82.8% of the respondents were agreeable to their firms’ emphasis on the factors
of innovation. However, it was found that GLCs that were owned by the federal government
placed more focus on innovation compared to the GLCs that were state-owned. This study
reveals that overall the Malaysian GLCs should enhance their innovation practices by placing
more focus on being engaged in the adoption of innovative designs at work, the reengineering
of business processes, innovative pricing, market distribution and promotional methods,
enhancing customer satisfaction by importing innovative warranty and maintenance systems,
as well as by importing innovative claim clearing processes and methods, and the adoption of
innovative order management and follow-up systems.

1. Introduction
The theory of resource-based view (RBV) emphasizes on the transformation of an
organization’s resources that are valuable in order to achieve its objectives (Barney, 1991).
The RBV suggests that firms that totally make use of their valuable resources including
skills, raw materials, and so on would be able to create competitive advantages compared to
their rivals (Grant, 1991), in addition to creating a competitive advantage that is sustainable
for their firms as well (Macfarlane, 2014). Competitive advantage can be defined as a
condition whereby a firm creates or improves on its own products while making it better than
the other similar products in the market, which belong to its competitors. According to
Ketchen and Short (2014), a sustainable competitive advantage would allow a firm to sustain
itself amidst environmental changes and to remain effective in the coming years through the
achievement of a competitive advantage that is long term, which would be costly and not
easily copied by its rivals (Papulova & Papulova, 2006).
Having a sustainable competitive advantage has many benefits since it is a strong source for a
firm to gain successful performance and to create value (Gupta & Benson, 2011). The study
by Barney (1991) claims that firms are able to develop a competitive advantage by gaining
rare, valuable, and inimitable capabilities and resources. Firms would be able to create value
and sustainability by gaining such resources. According to Kraaijenbrink and Spender (2011),
without the creation of value, firms would have no reason to be present in the market as they
would not be adding any value. The performance of firms can be enhanced through value
creation by maximizing per share earnings, ensuring high standards of operational efficacy,
remaining competitive (Gholami, 2011). These measures will in turn assist the firm to
execute strategies that enhance its competitiveness and efficacy (Porter, 1997).

Nevertheless, having resources alone will not guarantee value creation or gaining a
competitive advantage. The reason for this is that people conceive value in a very different
manner (Kraaijenbrink & Spender, 2011). Two people may not attach the same perception of
value to something. In addition, given the scale of globalization and the growth in
competition, it is difficult for firms to sustain and keep up with the rapid environmental
changes. Thus, firms should be able to provide or develop new products to distinguish
themselves in the market. The study by Prieto and Revilla (2006) reveals that firms with
differentiating products in the market would have the potential to reach greater heights and
also create value at the same time for their firms.
Thus, to preserve the sustainability feature in certain government agencies, the Malaysian
government privatized some of the organizations led by the establishment of GovernmentLinked Companies or GLCs. GLCs refer to firms which have achieved the fundamental
commercial aim of the government (Khazanah, 2014) with the government having a direct
control and stake in the firms (OECD, 2013). A controlling stake includes a percentage in the
ownership of the firm as well as a direct or indirect influence in appointing the senior
management and directors. It also means that the government is involved in granting
contracts, planning strategies, restructuring, finance, and the acquisitions and divestment via
its Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs). The Malaysian government controls
the GLCs through agencies such as the Khazanah, the Ministry of Finance, GLICs, Bank
Negara Malaysia, and the Employees Provident Fund.1
GLCs include a wide range of activities dealing with the economy such as
telecommunications, infrastructure, financial services, as well as agriculture. Therefore, the
GLCs have a pivotal role in the operations of each commercial issue in the country and
contribute in the improvement of the public’s quality of life in a significant manner
(Abdullah, 2007; Razak, 2012). GLCs are part of the corporate enterprise, which may include
a public listed or private organization. Nevertheless, the GLCs only represent 5% of the total
organizations in the Bursa Malaysia or previously called the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
However, the market capitalization of the market by the GLCs account for RM 232 billion,
which consists of higher than half of the GDP of Malaysia (Md Zin & Sulaiman, 2011).
The key aim of a firm is to enhance its performance and its business processes in order to
remain competitive just like other firms in the market (Aivazian, Ge, & Qiu, 2005). The study
by Phua (2001) found out that the economic planners in the government expect the
privatization of the public services would be quite beneficial to the nation. This is in
alignment with prior proof, which concurs that the privatization could develop the efficacy of
firms, create further development opportunities, lower the financial and administrative
concerns of the government of Malaysia while increasing the participation of Bumiputeras in
the corporate sector (Nambiar, 2009). However, in many instances the GLCs are mentioned
to be underperforming since they have to contend with two objective namely to address their
social duties as well as to be profitable. This concern has given an adverse image to the
GLCs.
As such, in May 2004, in order to solve this issue of underperformance, the government
developed the GLC Transformation Programme. The major aim for this programme is to
enhance the GLCs’ performance and the entire corporate division to perform in a successful
manner.

The transformation programme is a critical program because it is in alignment with the
nation’s aim to reach Vision 2020. Many GLCs have been effective in the implementation of
this programme including organizations like Telekom Malaysia, United Engineering
Malaysia Group Berhad as well as the Malaysian Airport Holding Berhad. These
organizations have become more successful in making more profits and to be recognized
internationally (Md Zin & Sulaiman, 2011).
Nevertheless, prior researches still reveal that the GLCs are lacking in the area of value
creation in comparison to non-GLCs (Feng, Sun, & Tong, 2004; Lau & Tong, 2008;
Entebang, 2010; Razak et al., 2011; Mohamad & Said, 2011). According to Muslim, Hafiz,
and Fekri Ali (2012), GLCs have been experiencing poor organizational performance because
of the lack in creating value in their firms which has caused the government to closely
monitor them. The study by Razak et al. (2011) discovered that the performances without
monitoring of the non-GLCs outperform the GLCs based on corporate governance as well as
other types of particular characteristics, that cause them to create more value compared to the
GLCs. The reason for this is due to the fact that the GLCs are not focused on maximising
profits too much since they are more concerned with nation building (Lau & Tong, 2008).
Some GLCs have not been able to create any value and have been experiencing poor
performance namely companies like the Proton Holding Berhad and the Malaysian Airline
System. Thus, the GLCs have to try harder with new initiative to create value in order to
address the government’s needs and expectations while increasing and adding value to their
services, products, and enterprise performance (Aziz et al., 2015a,b,c; Said et al., 2015,
2016a,b,c; Lawler & Mohrman, 2013; Zulkarnain et al. 2016). According to Khazanah
(2014), starting from 2015, GLCs must improve and work on their creation of value by
concentrating on sustainability practices and the execution. At present, GLCs, in particular
the G202 organizations have begun to emphasize on the sustainability practices in order to
reach value creation in the long term. Unfortunately, certain GLCs have the tendency to
disregard the significance of the sustainability practices since they have other objectives to
achieve as well. Additionally, at present, the number of researches on the area value creation
is also limited among GLCs Malaysia (Lau & Tong, 2008).
Given this situation, this study aims to examine the practices of having strategies on
sustainable competitive advantage among various categories of Malaysian GLCs. Innovation
is among the most critical component of a firm, that aims to be sustainable in the market
place (Rosli & Sidek, 2013; Shanker & Bhanugopan, 2014). It is able to aid GLCs in
enhancing the creation of value since the organizations would be able to develop some new
product or service (Munshi, 2010). Therefore, innovation is regarded as being critical since it
among the factors, which enable the firm to be sustainable and survive in the present
challenging business environment. Innovation contains important functions in the progress
and growth of the firm (Ishak & Ahmad, 2011).
In the Tenth Malaysia Plan which was set from 2011 to 2015, Dato’ Sri Mohd. Najib
Tun Abdul Razak, who is the Prime Minister of Malaysia, claimed that the government
would concentrate on improving the infrastructure in the country including the development
of skills and becoming equipped with innovation abilities. It shows that the government takes
the activities of R&D very seriously by providing venture capital funds to increase the level
2

G20 is the selection of large GLCs, which are controlled by GLICs under the GLCT Programme and is used as
a proxy for performance of the GLCs. However, the G20 currently consists of only 17GLCs due to mergers,
demergers, divestments, and other corporate exercises over the years.

of innovation in the country (Malaysia, 2010). The study by Ishak and Ahmad (2011)
suggests that GLCs must be able to strategize regarding the ways in which to optimize the
firms’ innovation capabilities to be sustainable and be capable of improving their
competencies. The research by Jaskyte (2012) claims the board of directors is the main
significant party in ensuring an organization’s innovation success. Nevertheless, they at times
appear to ignore the significance of innovation and do not consider it in a serious manner
(Wu & Cavusgil, 2006). Thus, this study examines the innovation practices for a sustainable
competitive advantage strategy among various categories of Malaysian GLCs.
2. Methodology
2.1 Sampling of Data and Data Collection
This study gathered its data from the responses given in a questionnaire survey participated
by 134 managers and executives in Malaysian GLCs. The questionnaires were distributed and
collected from February to April, 2015.
2.2 Measurements of Variables
This study aims to utilize ten parameters for the measurement of innovation practices taken
from Lin, Chen, and Shun Chiu (2010). The participants of the survey were asked about their
product, marketing, and service innovation. The factors are listed in the following:

My firm experiences the continued enhancement of current products,
processes, and services;
My firm has given its employees the opportunity to undertake innovation
training/education;
My firm regularly produces novel methods of managing the business;
My firm utilizes business process reengineering;
My firm adopts work designs that are innovative;
My firm is a leader in innovative pricing, distribution, and promotional
methods in the market;
My firm continuously widens it potential target market;
My firm enhances customer satisfaction by importing innovative warranties
and maintenance methods;
My firm enhances customer satisfaction by importing innovative claim
clearing processes and approaches; and
My firm adopts innovative follow-up and order management processes.

The respondents had to make comparisons with their rivals in similar industries over a period
of three years based on the innovation practices in their firms. The five-point Likert scale was
used in the questionnaire, which ranged from 1 to 5 or from strongly disagree to strongly
agree.
2.3 Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics was utilized to analyze the data. The data consistency was measured
using factor analysis while the Cronbach’s alpha test was utilized for the reliability testing of
the data. Additionally, the Skewness and Kurtosis testing was carried out to test the validity
of the data by testing the data normality.

38% while most of the respondents had a degree at 77.6%.

50.7% of the respondents are in the middle management job position with 39.6% coming
from the service industry and 9% from the manufacturing sector. Most of the respondents
were found in other sectors including broadcasting. Out of the GLCs analyzed in this study,
30% are state-owned and 64% are federal owned GLCs.
Slightly more than half (59.7%) of the respondents have been attached to their organization
for more than 5 years. Most of the respondents (61.2%) work in GLCs, which had more than
1000 employees in terms of number of employees.
3.2 Analysis
Ten variables were used to measure the innovation practices of the GLCs in this study.
According to the respondents, 82.8% were agreeable that their organizations practice these
innovation factors while 0.7% claimed that these were not practiced in their firms (Table 2).

Based on the innovation factors, the factor on continuous improvement received the highest
mean with 4.22 (I1), while importing claim-clearing processes and methods gained the lowest
mean at 3.7 (I9) (Table 2). Average mean value is at 3.96 for the entire study. There is
potential to enhance the overall innovative practices in these organizations by focusing on the
factors that received a below average mean score such as reengineering of business process
(I4), adopting innovative designs at work (I5), being a leader in innovative pricing,
distribution, and promotional approaches in the market (I6), enhancing customer satisfaction
by importing innovative warranties and maintenance methods (I8), enhancing customer
satisfaction by importing innovative claim clearing processes and approaches (I9), and
adopting innovative follow-up and order management processes (I10).
In general, the GLCs owned by the federal government focused more on innovation practices
compared to those owned by the state (Table 3). Based on the variables of innovation
practices in the study, it was found that GLCs owned by the state emphasized more on
offering training/education on innovation for their employees (I2) while placing the least
focus on enhancing customer satisfaction by importing innovative warranties and
maintenance methods (I8). However, the GLCs owned by the federal government
emphasized more on continued enhancement of current products, processes, and services (I1)

and not as much focus on enhancing customer satisfaction by importing innovative claim
clearing processes and approaches (I9).

Table 3 shows that GLCs from the manufacturing industry placed more emphasis on
innovation compared to all the other sectors particular on the area being engaged in
reengineering of business processes (I4) while placing the least focus on being the leader in
innovative pricing, distribution, and promotional methods in the market (I6). GLCs from the
service industry emphasized the most on continued enhancement of current products,
processes, and services (I1) while placing the least focus on enhancing customer satisfaction
by importing innovative warranties and maintenance methods (I8).
3.3 Diagnostic Testing
3.3.1 Consistency Test
Factor analysis is carried out to test the consistency of the data on the variables in the
measurement of innovation. Table 2 reveals that all the variables’ factor loading are higher
than 0.6 ranging from 0.67 (V10) to 0.84 (V1 & V2). It shows that all the ten variables are
good for measuring the innovation practices of the Malaysian GLCs.
3.3.2 Normality Test
Data distribution is tested by performing the normality test. Pallant (2013) suggests that data
normality can be tested by utilizing the skewness and kurtosis tests whereby the results of dat
that is distributed normally should have a kurtosis value of within -3 to 3 while the skewness
value should be less than zero. In this study, based on the variables of innovation, the value
for kurtosis is 0.497 while the value for skewness if -0.283, which means the data is in the
acceptable spectrum. Thus, the data can be accepted as being distributed normally.
3.3.3 Reliability Test
Table 4 denotes the Cronbach’s alpha value for innovation as 0.92, which means the
questions’ reliability is excellent as per the suggestion of George and Mallery (2003). The
eigenvalue testing shows that the factors utilized in the innovation practices explain 50.3% of
the variance. The test known as the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin reveals a value of more than 0.6 at
0.858 with Chi-Square being equivalent to 647 and p < 0.000. Thus, the data is adequate for
further testing using the factor analysis. In general, the test is supportive of the innovation
variables in this research.

4. Conclusion and Recommendations
Malaysia aims to become a developed country in line with its Vision 2020; however, there
are many steps that need to be taken by the GLCs in the area of value creation. Ten related
factors were assessed in this study to measure the current level of innovation practices of
various Malaysian GLCs from various industries. The consistency of the ten variables in this
measurement of innovation was given by the factor analysis. Among the respondents, 82.8%
agreed that these innovation practices were carried out in their organizations with an average
score of 3.96 out of a scale of 5.
Thus, there is potential for improvement in the innovation practices among the GLCs,
The GLCs should place additional emphasis in creating value in order to meet the
government’s needs and expectation while being able to develop and add value to their
products and services and performance in business at the same time (Lawler & Mohrman,
2013). In general, the GLCs must focus on reengineering of business processes, adopting
work designs that are innovative, being a leader in innovative pricing, distribution, and
promotional methods in the market, enhancing customer satisfaction by importing innovative
warranties and maintenance methods, enhancing customer satisfaction by importing
innovative claim clearing processes and approaches, and adopting innovative follow-up and
order management processes. Furthermore, GLCs that are owned by both the federal and
state governments found in the service and manufacturing industries should concentrate more
on particular areas in improving their practices in the innovation movement.
