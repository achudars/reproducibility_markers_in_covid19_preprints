"5" "A major goal of  government and non-profi t scientific funding agencies is  to  support  research and development (R&D)  that has broad impacts, generates responsible innovation, and positively impacts society .  This study proposes  a  new  framework ,  called the Inclusion -Immediacy Criterion (IIC), that better assesses the inclusion and immediacy of research to determine whether  the research helps  marginalized  communities , reduce s  inequality, and  encourages inclusive innovation.  To test the framework, the study analyzes  NSF sponsored  nanotechnology grant abstracts from  2013  to  2017 . We  find  that  109 out of the 300 grants feature research  that is inclusive , while 235 out of the 300 grants have broader impacts that  either maintain the status quo or  predominately  help advantage  groups . Using the Inclusion -Immediacy Criterion, policy maker s  and scholars  will better understand the potential impact of funded science."
"6" "Introduction"
"7" "There is a powerful desire among government and non-profit scientific funding agencies to support  research and development (R&D)  that has broad impacts, generates responsible innovation , and positively impacts society   (Bush, 1945; European Commission, 2018) .  To meet this requirement, science funding agencies  require  that principal investigators (PIs) include  broader impacts   or show  that their research  extends beyond the laboratory  (European Commission, 2018) .  Howe ver, the current  methods of assessing impact fail to  account for  two factors, the immediacy and inclusion of grant. The immediacy of a grant describes  the way the research integrates broader impacts  into the project. The inclusion of a grant  consider s  the impacts of the research on marginalized  communities. To  better assess the impacts that research has on margina lized communities, this article  outlines a new framework, called the  Inclusive-Immediacy C riterion  (IIC) ."
"8" "The IIC is a n ovel framework  that  extends   other  scholarship  that  classify  grants based on their broader impacts. Since the late 1990’s the National Science Foundation   (NSF)  has   required  scholars to discuss the br oader impacts of their research, and c onsequently, there are studies that assess the broader impact activities (BIA). The se  studies  classify the type and rate of BIA in NSF grants   (Kamenetzky, 2013; Roberts, 2009; Wiley, 2014) . However, there are several gaps in the literature.  First,  it is not clear the extent that the NSF is funding research that helps poor and marginalized communities.  The current broader impact categories intersect with  inclusiveness , but there  is  research that is inclusive and  is  not be covered by the BIC.   Second,   scholars did not measure the extent that   BIAs  are integrated into the research . Are the BIAs a core part of the project  or added as a side  activity  to the research ?   The degree that the broader impacts are  integrated into the research  effects  the type of projects  proposed, funded and completed."
"9" "The paper has six sections . S ection II  of  the article  give s  background on  the broader impact criterion  and the IIC ,  and  section III  discusses the  methods  used  test to the framework .   The team read and coded 300 NSF sponsored nanotechnology grant abstracts to evaluate the inclusiveness and immediacy of the scholarship. Section IV defines the new framework and  gives e xamples of how it is used .   Finally,  sect ion s  V  and VI discuss  the results  of the study  and  the  impact of  the framework  for sci ence policy."
"10" "Section II-  Literature Review and Conceptual Framework"
"11" "Broader Impact Criterion"
"12" "B efore the NSF existed, science policy makers, like  Vannevar  Bush, emphasized that scientific research could not be divorced from societal benefit. Bush saw science as a key component of national security, public welfare, the fight against disease, and education  (Bush, 1945) . Since Bush, the prominence of connecting science to societal impacts has remained a constant focus of scientific organizations ,  such as the Department of Energy or National Institutes of Health  (Roberts, 2009) . In 1997, the NSF formalized the need for research to make positive contributions to society by  requiring grants to discuss the way  the research will have broader impacts.  A big part of the NSF’s shift was  that  Congress was increasingly concerned with improving the  efficiency  and effectiveness of government. Congress wanted to see measurable results on how government money was spent   (Holbrook, 2005) ."
"13" "In Europe, policy makers and scientists assess the ethical value of research through the lens of Responsible Research and Innovation   (RRI). RRI “is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its   marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological  advances in our society) (von  Schomberg  2011b)”. The framework was first widely discussed in  European policy circles in 2011 and it was adopted in the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Strategy   (European Commission, 2018; Owen et al., 2012) ."
"14" "Despite the wide adoption of social standards to judge research, these types of programs are not universally popular  and  t here  are  steady  debate s  about the importance and value of the  broader impacts  and RRI   (Holbrook and Frodeman, 2007; Lok, 2010) .  One complaint from  grant applicants  is that the concepts  BIA and RRI  are  ambiguous and vague  (National Science Board, 2011; Owen et al., 2012) .   A pplicants do not know how to discuss the broader impact nor are they sure how  the proposed  broader impacts will be judged.   In response to the criticism, the National Science Foundation has regularly updated their guidelines on  broader impacts , but there is still some  confusion  (National Science Foundation, 2014) ."
"15" "A second complaint  is  that requiring broader impacts makes it harder to get grants because scientist now have the extra burden of requiring that their research direct ly  link s  to positive benefits for society  (Holbrook and Frodeman, 2007) . This  burden is  especially  felt by  junior  scholars   because they  may  not have the bandwidth  to do BIA   (Eisenstein and Cooper, 2007) ."
"16" "A third complaint attacks the philosophical roots of broader impacts and RRI. Some scientists do not believe that their research should even be judged based on its broader impacts   (Holbrook and Frodeman, 2007) .  These scientists  argue that research  may not have any apparent broad er impacts for society ,  but the topics sh ould still be explored  to fu rt her  scientific knowledge . Also,  in the future ,  the research could become  invaluable.  Other scholars argue that   broader impact criterion is based on a flawed linear model  of R&D  and the requirements do  not match that the reality of   R&D   (Holbrook and Frodeman, 2007) . Rather,   models like Pasteur’s quadrant,  a two by two grid of consideration of use and quest for  fundamental  understa nding, or the streams metaphor  of R&D  (Fisher et al., 2006; Holbrook, 2005; Stokes, 1997)  better match R&D .   Moreover, rather than forcing a natural science grant to include broader impacts, like broadening STEM participation, it would be more efficient to fund grants designed to have broader impacts.  Currently, researchers must divide their attention  and  work on projects that are not their  specialty   (Eisenstein and Cooper, 2007) ."
"17" "Finally ,  a  fourth criticism of the  requiring b roader  i mpact s  is  grant  peer review is an inadequate  process  to access broader impacts   (Bozeman and Boardman, 2009) . Peer review is  based on specialized knowledge and  most peer review panels feature experts on a given subject matter. In general , review  panels do not feature experts on broader impacts and outreach . As a result,  the panelists are  evaluating  broader impac t s without any skill in assessing the quality and potential benefit of the project   (Bozeman and Boardman, 2009) ."
"18" "Despite the criticism, requirements like BIC and RRI are not losing salience.  There are steady calls from  politicians  to make science more accountable , transparent and applied   (Holbrook and Frodeman, 2007) .  In response, science funding organizations must  keep enforcing BIA  to match legislation  (National Science Board, 2011) ."
"19" "The NSF  codified their broader impacts requirements into the broader impact criterion (BIC). The BICs are not rigidly defined, but r ather, the agency  has purposefully stated that broader impacts encompass a range of activities from increasing diversity in STEM fields to sharing results with the public  (National Science Foundation, 2014) . In general, broader impacts are categorized into eight areas: infrastructure for science, broadening participation, training and education, academic collaborations, K-12 outreach, potential societal benefit, outreach/broad dissemination, and partnerships with potential users  (see table 1)   (Kamenetzky, 2013) . In 2009, Roberts studied the  distribution of  BIC .  Roberts divides  the eight  broader impacts  categories  into criteria for  science and criteria for society. She finds that  of the grants that included broader impact statements “89% proposed broader impacts for science and 66% proposed broader impacts for society”  (Roberts, 2009) ."
"20" "Other scholars conducted similar studies but looked at  particular fields . For instance,  Kamenet z ky  analyzed broader impacts in biology, mathematical and physical sciences  (Kamenetzky, 2013)  and  Nadkarni and  Stasch  examined the broader impacts of  Ecosystems Studies Programs  (Nadkarni and Stasch, 2013) .   Watts et al. examined the Division of Environmental Biology  (DEB)   (Watts et al., 2015) .   The Watts study  had access to the full proposal, panel review summaries, and project reports of DEB. They find  that PIs proposed slightly more BIAs, 5.5%,  than they  accomplished . Another major finding was that  awarded grants proposed 10% more BIAs than non-awarded grants   (Watts et al., 2015) ."

"41" "Revising Broader Impact Criterion"
"42" "The  few  studies  on the distribution of BICs  and  the persistent  concern  from scientists  about the BIC  shows that the guidelines need to be reformed .  In 2016, a team of NSF officials and PIs held an NSF-sponsored workshop on the BIC  (Jacobson et al., 2016) . They recom mended the NSF change the  panel review guidelines, so the panel considers the inherent nature of the BIA to the research. Are the BIAs intrinsic, directly related on extrinsic to the proposed research?  Intrinsic immediacy means that the BIA is central to the research project. For instance, if a PI is developing a new  solar panel , the broader impacts  of producing  clean energy,  are intrinsic t o the grant. Direct immediacy are broader impacts that  are achieved while conducting the research.  An  example  of direct immediacy is  training graduate students while  doing research. Training the student is not the goal of the research project, but it would impossible to finish the project unless graduate students are trained. T he  third  level of immediacy is when the BIA are extrinsic to the actual  project. If a PI visits a K-12 school to share the research results on nuclear physics, then the BIA  is separate from the research and has  extrinsic immediacy (see Table  2 )."
"43" "To the immediacy classification, this project a dds a dimension on inclusivity to determine  the   types of people that benefit from the research.   Some innovations help everyone, regardless of status.  These innovation s  are classified as universal  and o ften grants with universal impact solve a market failure.  For example, research to combat the effects of climate change  solve s  a  “tragedy of the commons” market failure  (Hardin, 1968) .   The research  is important  everyone and everyone benefits from the research ."
"44" "Other innovations primarily help advantaged groups and maintain the statu s quo. These innovations  could   eventually  diffuse  to marginalized communities , but  only after they have been redesigned or afte r power groups have fully benefited from the innovation.  For example, research to design better watches and fabrics is primarily for powerful groups, like the military, or wealthy consumers that can afford that technology."
"45" "The third category of inclus ive innovation are innovations that  are designed to help mar ginalized communities directly. R&D to create a new malaria vaccine exemplifies this category because malaria predominantly impacts people in low income countries."
"46" "This project  combines the immediacy and inclusion criterion to create a new model of assessing broader impacts  called the  Inclusive-Immediacy Criterion  (IIC) . This new model  fills a gap in developing and  evaluating  broader  impacts  because it determines the potential impact of research o n  marginalized groups.  Currently,  inclusion is not a prominent factor in BIA.   By failing to account for the impact of funded research on marginalized communities, the current  BIC   signals that  inclusive  innovation is not a priority ."
"47" "In addition ,  this  new framework  does not classify broader impacts based on a list of eight criteria. As mentioned before ,  when the NSF generates a list of potential broader impact, applicants tend to simply add one of the listed impacts to the study   (National Science Board, 2011)  and a pplicants are less likely to think of creative ways to have broader impact on society. The new framework focuses on who will benefit from the project and how the broader impacts relates to the central goal of the grant.  Therefore, it does not narrow the types of broader impacts to a few categories. Finally,  the new framework can be applied to a range of funding  agencies, and projects. By designing a framework that  gives a general measure of inclusivity  is possible to compare the inclusiveness of research across funding agencies and countries."

"67" "This study is the first attempt to apply the IIC to  measure the inclusivity  and immediacy  of federally funded research proposals. To test the framework,  t his  project  examines  nanotechnology grants.  Nanotechnology is the study and manipul ation of matter between  1 -100 nanometers  in order to make novel products and applications  (Balogh, 2010) . Nanotechnology is an ideal case study for two reasons. First,   over the past 15  years, scholars have conducted numerous meta- studies of nanotechnology research ,  so there are reliable search strategies and tools to  gather a random sample of nanotechnology grants and  assess the impacts of nanotechnology   (Cozzens et al., 2013; Philip Shapira and Meng, 2009; Wang and Shapira, 2011) .   Second,  the authors have studied  inequality in nanotechnology, so they have expertise in  determining  the impacts of nanotechnology  research   on   marginalized  groups   (Cozzens et al., 2013; Subramanian et al., 2012; Woodson, 2012)   ."
"68" "To find nanotechnology grants  for the analysis , th e  project  employs   a two-stage  nanotechnology search strategy developed by Arora et al. (2012).  I n  the first stage,  the s trategy  use s   a  list of nanotechnology related wo rds to find all the grants  with those keywords .   Then ,  the s trategy   use s  a s eparate set of exclusion terms  to remove grants that  are not related to nanotechnology . Some of the exclusion terms are words like  nanoplanckton  and nanoseco n d .   The nanotechnology search strategy  found  26,474  nanotechnology grants from 2000-2017."
"69" "After developing the  corpus of  nanotechnology  grants,  we  limited the analysis to  the 6,854  nanotechnology grants from  2013  to  2017.  I n 2013 ,  the NSF made major changes to the BIC proposal guidelines   and  required  applicants  to  make their broader impacts and intellectual contribution more explicit  in grant applications . The changes to the proposal and proposal summary do not automatically  require  abstracts  to  discuss broader impacts, but it increases the likelihood that the abstracts will have broader impacts. Previous studies on BIA from 2000-2010 found that 26.2% of abstracts did not contain broader impacts even though the main proposal discussed BIA. From this observation, the  previous studies  conclud e  that analyzing the abstracts from before 2013 is not very accurate   (Watts et al., 2015) ."
"70" "Out of the  6,85 4  grants, the team randomly  selected 300 grants to code. A   sample of 3 00  gives a  margin of error is 5.53. Th is margin of error is sufficient for an exploratory qualitative study   (Bartlett et al., 2001; Raosoft Inc, 2004) ."
"71" "Parallel to creating the corpus of nanotechnology grants, the authors developed a coding strategy to   find the  distinct types  broader impacts found in the IIC   (see   Table  2 ) . The team review ed  the literature on broader impacts and inclusive innovation  to develop a  definition for each cell. Then, using a training set o f grants, the research team  define d  a coding scheme and   verbally  discussed any disagreements between the coders.  Finally,   the research team  code d the  sample of  nanotechnology  NSF abstracts to determine the imme diacy and type of inclusion of  the grant .  If there was any conflict in the coding guidelines, the researchers would discuss the problem.  The team used RQDA to manage and code the grant abstracts.  RQDA is package on the R statistical platform for qualitative data analysis."
"72" "Intercoder reliability"
"73" "To verify the accuracy of the coding,  a   second  research er in the team coded  a reliability sample of  10%   grants  from t he nanotechnology sample.  The sample was taken from the 300 grants used in the main analysis.  In the first round of intercoder tests, the  Krippendorff alpha score between the two coders was  moderately low (0.602). Upon close  inspection ,  the scores  of  the secondary coder systematically misinterpreted the codes for  infrastructure  for science, p otential societal benefit and universal intrinsic.  When those errors were  recoded based on the correct classification strategy, the Krippendorff Alpha score increase d  to 0.77 . This  sufficient  high Krippendorff alpha score  to determine that the  coders  are reliable  (Hallgren, 2012; Hayes and Krippendorff, 2007; Krippendorff, 2011) ."
"74" "Section IV- Inclusion  Immediacy Criterion"
"75" "As mentioned before, the  inclusion-immediacy framework  has  two dimensio ns each with three level s  that  form a 3X3 grid. Each cell in the grid represents a different type of inclusivity and immediacy. Unlike previous classification frameworks for broader impacts, the IIC does not classify the type of activity being conducted.  For example, the IIC does not count the number of K-12 outreach programs or university courses developed.  Rather, the IIC focuses on who will benefits from the research and the centrality of the work to the overall goals of the project. By analyzing the intensity of the broader impacts, we can better understand which populations benefit from the research. For example, developing a new malaria vaccine and posting lectures notes online impact marginalized communities different. The IIC  framework  recognize s  th e se differences."
"76" "The chart is not a hierarchy .  One  cell is  not  better than another cell . Instead the cells  represent different degrees of inclusion and immediacy. Depending on the goals of the project, it may be smarter to have broader impacts that are extrinsic to the research. Some  research  outputs are geared towards the scientific community ,  which is an advantage community. For example, many hi-tech products, like military equipment or quantum computers ,  will first be used by businesses and wealthy people ,  and over time ,  the technology should diffuse to  middle and low- income  populations .  T here nothing inherently wrong with developing the next generation computer processor, but reviewers should be aware of  that the research will primarily benefit advantaged groups."
"77" "Intrinsic / universal -"
"78" "In this cell, the grant  proposes  research that could benefit  everyone  and the broader impacts are intrinsic to the research. An example of a research project that is intrinsic universal is research on a smart grid system.  A  smart er electricity  grid  will  improve electricity distribution across  the  country and everyone,  regardless of  a person’s  income status , would benefit from  the technology   (Fang et al., 2012) . Grid improvements are non-rivalrous and non- excludable.  The broader impacts are also intrinsic to the research.  The goal of the rese arch has broad impacts.   Below is a quote from grant that is characterized as intrinsic universal."
"79" "“1438385: Advanced combustion engines being developed for meeting our transportation needs achieve improved fuel efficiency by lowering exhaust temperatures.   This puts  demands on the technology for catalytic converters, since these catalysts must become active at lower temperatures.   The proposed research addresses the design of these catalysts, leading to improvements in air quality and to societal needs for energy.”"
"80" "In this grant abstract the researchers are developing technology to lower  vehicle  emission and  improve air quality. The entire  population will benefit from this research, universal, and the broader impacts are central to the research, intrinsic."
"81" "Intrinsic/Advantage and status quo"
"82" "Grants in this category  are either  geared towards advantage groups or  maintain  the status quo power dynamic.  Though technology  developed for advantaged groups  may  eventually diffuse to marginalized communities , the users who will ben e fit from the  research in the category  will mostly  advantage  groups.  An example of  a technology that fits in  this category is  3D printers .  The first users of th is   technology   were  advantage communiti es who could  afford the  printers  and had the ability to design 3D objects.  Eventually ,  the  technology  could be  widely adopted by lower income users, but research shows that  there are systematic failures that prevent 3D printers from  automatically help ing  low income p opulations   (Woodson, 2015) ."
"83" "In the  following example,  the grant proposes a  project  to   creat e   software and  a web portal   for the chemistry community . The chemistry community  is   an advantage group because chemists tend to be a highly educated and wealthy compared to the rest of the population   (Rovner, 2014) .  As a result ,  this grant was classified as intrinsic/advantaged.   The grant “develop[s] theories a nd  computer  software  to model the motion on electrons…and  also develop an open source chemistry web portal where the chemical community and educators can access and apply these tools without expensive computer hardware, software or expertise.”"
"84" "The  team c ode s   grants   that  propose  new in frastructure, materials or datasets  as intrinsic/advantage . For example , one grants says   “1708885: The goal of this project is to create a new type of terahertz generator that is compact, inexpensive and works at room temperature.”   The BIA is intrinsic to the research and the research will primarily help advantaged groups ."
"85" "Intrinsic / Inclusive"
"86" "Research in this cell  targets marginalized groups.  A clear example of research that fits into this category is R&D on d eveloping a new malaria vaccine . Malaria is   a disease that impacts people in low income  countries,  so the inherent goal of the research is to be inclusive .  In the nanotechnology   dataset  there was a project to “ develop an affordable device that will allow the visually handicapped community to access digital information in a robust format comparable to a mobile tablet computer”. This research clearly benefits a marginalized group."
"87" "Direct/ Univer s al"
"88" "Direct  broader impacts are related to the research  project, but the broader impacts  are not the research.  However, i t would be very challenging ,  if not impossible ,  to c omplete the research without  addressing the BI C  along the way . Universal broader  impacts  help everyone regardless of status.  Direct/ Universal  grants are one of the harder cells to identify, however many partnerships  with public sector organiza tions fall into this category.  The collaboration is necessary for the  research ,  and  the  collaboration  is not the purpose of the research.  An example of direct/universal  grant   discu sses how their research will be ”   integrated into construction of hazard maps published by the Utah Geological Survey” . The Utah Geological Survey is necessary for the research and the science benefits all people."
"89" "Direct/advantage status quo"
"90" "In t his cell, the broader impacts are  directly related to the research and the main groups of people that benefit from research are advantages and status quo groups. The most common type of impact that fits in this cell is training graduate students. In general ,  graduate students are advantage group. Only 9% of  Americans  between the ages of 25-29 will earn a Master’s or higher and students with graduate degrees have many advantages over people without graduate degrees   (U.S. Department of Education, 2018) . Therefore, programs  for graduate students will, in general, help advantage groups and maintain the status quo."
"91" "Training graduate students is directly related to the research, but in most cases, graduate training in not the actual research. Training the students is a means to accomplish the end goal of the research project and in the process and student is trained.  Consequently, graduate training is categorized as direct."
"92" "We also placed sharing research results with other academics as directly related to research and benefiting advantage groups . G oing to conference and disseminating results is a key part of research process, but  it is  not the  main goal of  most   funded  project. Finally, industry collaborations are considered direct and advantaged broader impacts. Unless the industrial collaboration explicitly says that the R&D will help a marginalized group or serve the entire population, it is assumed that an industrial collaboration is profit seeking, and hence, will maintain the status quo  or  help advantaged groups .  There are rare cases where  the main goal of a  profit seeking enterprise  is to help marginalized communities, like in bottom of the pyramid innovation   (Prahalad, 2004) , but again, the authors must explicitly state that goal.  For example, one grant mentioned partnering with the  graphic processing unit ( GPU )  industry and another project developed a strategic partnership with a global automotive firm.  The results of these partnerships will help advantage groups."
"93" "A good example  of  an education program  that is  direct/advantage  is a grant that helps  “ students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships . ”"
"94" "Direct/ Inclusive"
"95" "Grants in t his cell  are   like   direct/advantaged   grants , but instead of the research helping advantaged groups , the research   directly  help s  marginalized communities. The best example of a research that fits in this category is training graduate s tudent from marginalized groups .  For example, one grant says that “ a portion of the funds will be used to develop a network of female STEM faculty in the  XXXX  region which fosters the retention and promotion of STEM women in academia, and  mentor’s  women transitioning to academia from postdoctor al and graduate positions.” Another type of grant that  fall s  in this category propose  developing research infrastru cture in a low- income country. For example, if the research team installs a water pump to supply their field station, the pump is necessary to finish the research, and  the pump  helps m arginalized communities."
"96" "Extrinsic/ Universal"
"97" "Grants in the category propos e  extra outreach activit ies  that  are unrelated  to  the  research and  will have universal impact . The most common type of activities that fits in this category are  developing a new K-12 curriculum that incorporates finding from the research.   In theory, the new curriculum could help everyone regardless of status because every child in the USA is entitled to  K-12  education. Other types of BIA that fall in this category are educating the  public  and working with public museums. Within our sample ,  a classic example of  grant with  an extrinsic universal broader impact is “ The results of this project are disseminated through a comprehensive set of education and outreach activities that include graduate curriculum development, undergraduate laboratories, and a materials science exhibit at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry”.  Developing the undergraduate and graduate course work will maintain the status quo, but creating an exhibit at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry will universally impact the Chicago community."
"98" "Extrinsic/status quo and advantage"
"99" "This cell represents broader impacts that are not related to the research and help advantage groups. Some examples of broader impacts that fit in this category are creating science podcasts and developing new graduate courses related to the research. One grant proposed to “ create a video game lab experience aimed at students and the public.”  The coders believe that the video game would mostly help advantaged communities who have access to the game and it would not automatically reach disadvantaged communities."
"100" "An example that was hard to classify was a lecture series at a senior citizen center that is “ focusing on demystifying materials chemistry”.  Th e coders debated whether the elder ly  constitute a marginalize community. They decided that in this instance the elderly community was not marginalized because the  program is hosted in an exclusive retirement community ."
"101" "Inclusive/extrinsic"
"102" "This final category represents broader impacts that ar e unrelated to the research and  will help marginalized groups.  Some potential  activities  that fit in this category are  developing a class for disabled students or creating a STEM outreach program for low-income children. One example  from the data set was an education program in Uganda for kids .  “The education plan involves collaborations with universities in Uganda, and will use hands-on experiment kits and virtual teamwork to train students to work on diverse teams to tackle global challenges"

"104" "Table  3  shows the distribution  of coding across the nine cells of the IIC .  On the immediacy dimension  the most common category was direct ( 232 ) followed by intrinsic (200) and then extrinsic (110)  grants had direct.  None of the grants only proposed broader impacts that were extrinsic to the grant."
"105" "In the other dimension, the most common type of inclusion was advantaged (235), followed by universal (213)  and inclusive (109). Within  inclusive grants 94%  of them  are about broadening STEM participation. We found only nine grants in the sample that were intrinsic /  inclusive. These grants pro po sed  activities  like water filtration systems, medical diagnostics systems, and energy storage for rural electrification.  Therefore, PIs are proposing research that is inclusive , 109 grants,  but  at lower rates than research that has universal benefit or benefits advantaged groups."

"131" "When comparing the IIC to the predefined categories of the NSF  ( Table  4 ) , there are obvious overlaps.  160 out of 162 grants  that are universal/intrinsic  have potential societal benefit  and 160 out of 174 potential society benefit grants are considered universal/intrinsic .  Similarly,  K-12 outreach and Universal/Extrinsic are closely linked together.  ( See Sankey diagram  in supplemental material  for visual representation ) .    21 5  out of 219  Training/education  grants are classified as advantaged and direction."
"132" "A smaller, yet important ,  finding addresses  a prominent  criticism of broader impacts .  Some scientist  argue  that the broader impact  requirement is inefficient because  it requires  scientists  to do  work , like developing K-12 curriculum,  that is outside of the ir  specialty   (Eisenstein and Cooper, 2007) .  Critics of the BIC argue that i t would be more  effective for  scientists  to f ocus on their research and  give grants to  teachers, museums  and community organizers to do b roader impacts. This study find that 200/300 grants abstracts propose broader impacts that are intrinsically related to the research.  There are 110 grants that include extrinsic broader impacts, but  there are no grants  in  this study  that only  proposed  extrinsic  broader impacts. Every grant in the sample that proposed a broader impact included an intrinsic or direct broader impact.  The project cannot determine the amount of effort spent on extrinsic  broader impacts, but extrinsic broader impacts are a small proportion of broader impacts."

"243" "The  IIC   addresses  a persistent problem in broader impact statements of quality vs quantity. Previous studies on broader impacts state that scholars may simply use the broader impacts as a checklist and try to score as many points as possible as opposed to suggesting a quality project   (National Science Board, 2011) . While reading the abstracts, it is easy to spot PI s  who propose an inoperable number of broader impacts without any description of how they will achieve their goals.  We code these type of grants as having broader impacts, but without details. For exa mple, when they are describing broadening participation  the  authors  simple say “ The project-related activities also ex pand the curriculum and cutting- edge research opportunities in materials science and engineering with significant inclusion of u nderrepresented students.” This grant does not give any indication of how it will include u nderrepresented groups. Since the grants  mentions that is tr ying to have broader impacts, it  must  be  code d  as broadening participation, even though  the grant does not detail how  it will broaden  participation .  In comparison ,  one grant says ,  “in order to provide an interdisciplinary science experience to high school students , Professor XXX  will develop science workshops p artnering with the YYYY  Foundation and the  ZZZZ Math and Science Program . ” This grant gave specific comments on how they have broader impacts."
"244" "To better understand the intensity of the broader impacts, the team coded   five  categories, academic collaborations, broadening  participation, Outreach/Broad Dissemination,  K-12 Outreach,  and training and education as having “with details” or “without details”  (see  Table  5 ).   In some categories, like academic collaboration, the grant abstracts contain a lot of details about the proposed broader impacts, while other categories, like training and education,  have  a larger  proportion  of the grants contain less information. For this study we cannot determine why the grant  abstracts have this type of trend, but future analyses of broader impacts  or IIC  need to be aware that  grant  abstracts  can have  include a  broader impact, yet not give  no  detail s about the pr oject ."

"264" "Th e  new coding scheme based on inclusivity and immediacy better measures the impact of funded  research , but it will not  solve all the problems  associated with requiring research to impact society . One critique of the NSF review process is that the grant review panels do not include experts on education, public outreach, and  policy   (Bozeman and Boardman, 2009; Holbrook and Frodeman, 2007) ,  and therefore ,  the expertise to decide the impacts of gran ts is not in the room. If science fundi ng agencies fully adopt the IIC ,  but do not change the composition of the   review panelists,  then  there will still be a mismatch between scientific expertise and assessing broader impacts."
"265" "This study is also limited because it  examines nanotechnology research .  Nanotechnology  is  more applied  than fields ,  like pure mathematics, and t herefore, it may be easier for nanotechnology scientists to directly tie their research to socie tal benefit. Scholars need to apply the IIC to other fields  to determine whether research in those fields  have similar patterns as nanotechnology .  Finally ,  the framework needs to be tested on  several types  of grants. For example, how well does this framework classify non-research  grants, like grants funding research experience for undergraduates or museums ?"
"266" "Overall, most of  grants in the sample  research will help everyone (universal) , 213 ,  or advantage groups , 235.  109  of the 300 grants  proposed broader impacts that were inclusive and only 9 grants propose research that is intrinsic and inclusive.  Th is  means  that  most of the  grants propose research that was not specifically directed towards marginalized groups.  Depending on the policy maker’s perspective these ratios can be viewed positively or negatively. This study cannot determine the ideal  distribution of science funding , but b y reexamining broader impacts activities through the lens of inclusivity and immediacy,  scholars  can better inform science policy decision makers  about  the impact  that  NSF sponsored research has on marginalized communities.   In addition, shifting the evaluation of  research from a checklist of broader impacts to a system that judges the nature of scientific activities  changes the discussion of broader impacts. Instead of broader impacts being an extra activity, scientists can discuss how their research has intrinsic  impact. The se changes will make science funding more impactful."
