Abstract.
Research on business, management and accounting (BMA) in the past century has been overwhelming.
Regardless of its significance, regions such as Ibero-America have been overlooked from exhaustive studies on
bibliometrics in the subject of BMA. Here, a bibliometric outlook of the subject of BMA in Ibero-America was
conducted by analyzing the ten most cited documents in BMA in each country from 1996 to 2017 using the
citation database Scopus. The main findings showed: a rapid increase in documents’ production; both Spain
and Portugal domain the overall documents’ production and citations; most of the documents are pay-walled;
the most-desired journal in the region is also the most- suspicious; a Pareto distribution in both citations by
documents and authors by documents; and institutional status has a significant effect on AACSB
accreditation.
Keywords: Business; Management; Accounting; Bibliometrics; Ibero-America.

Introduction

Since the publication of the first volume of Management Science in 1954 by The Institute of Management
Science at Columbia University, research on business, management, and accounting (BMA) has been
exceptionally fertile. This tide of intellectual productivity over the past half-century requires bibliometric
methods such as citations, co-citations, bibliographic coupling, co-authoring, and co-wording to comprehend
the dynamics related to document production and impact by journals, authors, institutions, and countries;
and the mutual influence between disciplines and the social capital of scholars from a quantitative angle
(Zupic and Čater, 2015). These bibliometric analyses also have been abundant. By performing a Boolean
search on bibliometric studies on BMA (Bib-BMA) using Scopus, 200 documents were found (i.e., 159 papers,
35 conference papers, and six book chapters) from 1996 to 2016 (Scopus, 2018). Regardless of these
developments, several Bib-BMA focused on specific countries were found, and yet no study was focused on
Ibero-America (i.e., Latin America, Spain, and Portugal). Moreover, neither institutions nor authors from
outside the United States of America (USA) have been pinpointed either when conducting exhaustive BibBMA (Podsakoff et al., 2008) nor mapping scientific excellence around the globe (Mapping Scientific
Excellence, 2018).
The intention of studying a defined set of countries instead of either the most cited documents or
authors/journals with the highest h-index in Ibero-America was to amplify the inclusion criteria of researchers
and institutions from the region excluded by previous assessments. Considering the significant correlation
between journal productivity and citations (Tsay and Ma, 2003) a study focused on analyzing the
aforementioned variables in Ibero-America would be biased towards documents published by researchers from
Spain, Brazil, and Portugal, as these are the most productive countries. While researchers from Panama,
Nicaragua or Venezuela would be out of focus. This broad inclusion would allow a refined understanding of
each country instead of focusing on a select group. Therefore, the objective of this study was to comprehend

1

the bibliometric features of the subjects of BMA in Ibero-America by analyzing the ten most cited in BMA
documents in each country from 1996 to 2017 using the citation database Scopus. A comprehensive framework
of 18 variables was developed to conduct the bibliometric overview.
In the next section, the literature review is presented, then, the bibliometric outlook is divided in seven
subsections: regional and countries, publication, citations and h-index, title text-mining analysis, authors,
and status and accreditation. In the seventh section, we conducted an analysis on the differences among
institutional status on the Field-Weighted Citation Impact, authors’ h-index, documents published, journals’
h-index, leading authors, and open access. Afterward, the results are discussed. Finally, the conclusions are
presented.

Literature review

English-language research on Bib-BMA has orbited around three centers of gravity: BMA-related subjects,
economic sectors, and specific journals. First, the main BMA-related subjects have been accounting (Chung et
al., 1992), business ethics (Ma et al., 2012; Talukdar, 2011), business and management education (Arbaugh
and Hwang, 2015), corporate social responsibility (De Bakker et al., 2006), dynamic capabilities in strategic
management (Vogel and Güttel, 2013), mergers and acquisitions (Ferreira et al., 2014), global strategy (Peng
and Zhou 2006), supply chain management (Feng et al., 2017), and university–industry–state collaboration
(Abramo et al., 2009; Marsilio et al., 2011). The most studied subjects (≥ 3 documents) have been
entrepreneurship (Merigó and Yang, 2017; Rey-Martí et al., 2016; Wallin, 2012), marketing (Baumgartner,
2010; Fetscherin and Heinrich, 2015; Kim and McMillan, 2008), innovation (Lazzarotti et al., 2011; Randhawa
et al., 2016; Yeo et al., 2015), and tourism (Koseoglu et al., 2016; Ruhanen et al., 2015). Second, the most
studied economic sector (≥ 3 documents) has been the pharmaceutical industry (Koenig, 1983; Narin and
Rozek, 1988). This is predictable, as studies on patent citations are commonly conducted to measure the
industry’s knowledge production and technological impact. Third, Bib-BMA have examined specific journals
such as Family Business Review (Casillas and Acedo, 2007), Journal of Product Innovation Management
(Durisin et al., 2010), Knowledge-Based Systems (Cobo et al., 2015), Harvard Business Review (Schulz and
Nicolai, 2015), International Small Business Journal (Volery and Mazzarol, 2015) and Journal of Emerging
Technologies (O’Leary, 2009). These studies aimed to measure the productivity and impact of researchers,
journals, business schools, and institutions (mostly universities); to map the social capital of authors and
institutions (through co-authorship) and the intellectual structure of the field (through co-citations or
bibliographic coupling); to identify consolidated or trending themes; and to restate bibliometric laws (e.g.
Bradford’s law or Lotka’s law).
The study conducted by Podsakoff et al. (2008) must be analyzed in detail. This aimed to identify the
universities and scholars that had the greatest impact and its causes in the field of management from 1981 to
2004. The authors found that only a few universities and scholars accounted for the majority of the citations;
university size, the number of PhDs awarded, research expenditure, and endowment assets had the biggest
impact on university publications, while total number of publications, years in the field, graduate school
reputation, and editorial board membership had the biggest effect on scholars’ citations. It is important to
note that only 15 universities from outside the USA and none from Ibero-America were ranked in the 100
most cited universities.
On the other hand, the Spanish/Portuguese-language Bib-BMA literature has focused on two main areas:
BMA-related topics and specific journals. First, the main BMA-related subjects that were identified were
accounting (Moya and Prior, 2008), business process management theory (Iritani et al., 2015), corporate
governance (Flórez-Parra et al., 2014) and entrepreneurship (Arias et al., 2016; Servantie et al., 2016). An
emergent subject that was not found in the English-language literature was women’s access to management
positions (Selva et al., 2011). Second, specific journals were studied such as Revista Europea de Dirección y
Economía de la Empresa (Lamazaresa and Chicónb, 2012). These studies’ objectives were similar to those

2

mentioned in the English-language review, hence, to determine who published and where common
methodologies and mapping of emerging themes.
Considering the developments of previous studies, this study would contribute in six fronts, namely: a
regional-focus in Ibero-America; to diminish the disengagement from authors, journals, and
universities/business schools from the Global-South (plus Spain and Portugal); analyzing the presence of
business schools with international accreditation (i.e., the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of
Business [AACSB]); defining the status of the most influential institutions in the region, be they private,
public or multilateral, and their effect on Field-Weighted Citation Impact, authors’ h-index, documents
published, journals’ h-index, leading authors, and open access (OA); mapping the current state of the use of
OA journals; and making available an OA database to perform replications or conduct further studies in
response to recent requests from the scientific community (Aarts et al., 2015).

Data sources

Two of the most popular data sources for scientometrics studies are Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science (WoS)
and Elsevier’s Scopus. Scopus was selected for the following reasons: institutional access; greater journal
coverage (Scopus: 20.346 journals vs. WoS: 13.605 [149% more journals]); greater social sciences coverage
(Scopus: ≈25% vs. WoS: ≈15% as a proportion of Ulrich’s periodicals directory); greater coverage of both
articles and journals published by countries in Ibero-America (e.g., Spain and Brazil); overlapping coverage
(≈84% of active titles in WoS were also indexed in Scopus); and the recent implementation of the FieldWeighted Citation Impact (FWCI) (Gavel and Iselid, 2008; Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2016). The starting point
for the analysis was fixed as 1996 because Scopus has only been adding cited references since then (Scopus,
2015). The AACSB website provided information on accredited business schools. The data used in this study

accreditation is seen as one of the “Triple Crown” of

(EQUIS). Since its foundation, the AACSB has been
virtually unchallenged in its accreditation activities, and
its standards are acknowledged as some of the most
rigorous and selective in business education (Durand,
McGuire 2005). Both research output and impact are
included in the AACSB’s standards (Standard 2:
Intellectual contribution, impact, and alignment with the
mission statement) (AACSB, 2017a, p. 18). So by
considering the AACSB, we added research impact and
output amid a broader frame of excellence in management
education. Source: AACSB website.

4 Results
4.1 Regional and countries overview 1996-2017

The increase of documents published by researchers from Ibero-America in BMA has been remarkable, with
a total of 51,082 documents published during 1996-2017. The total number of publications per year has also
increased significantly, rising from 235 documents in 1996 to 6,564 in 2017 (Figure 1). There were two outliers:
Spain and Brazil (Figure 2). Both countries published 33,471 documents during 1996-2017 (65% of the total).
Indeed, a Pareto distribution emerged whereby Spain, Brazil, Portugal, and Mexico (20% of the countries)
published 43,233 documents (84% of the total).

Publication overview

It was planned to analyze the 10-most cited documents from each of the 22 countries of Ibero-America (a total
of 220 documents) but the sample was reduced to 208 because documents from Honduras, Paraguay, and El
Salvador did not had at least one citation. The most cited documents were paywalled (94%) English-language
(78%) articles (75%). Other types of publications were book chapters (15%), conference proceedings (9%),
and books (1%). The second and third most common languages were Spanish (17%) and Portuguese (5%),
which was something of a paradox in a Spanish-Portuguese dominated region. Only 6% of the documents
were OA.
The journal Espacios was the most desired journal in the region as researchers from 13 out of 22 countries had
published at least one article. This is critical in countries such as Brazil (2,896 articles), Colombia (464) and
Venezuela (101). The data also showed that this journal has published +4,500 documents since 2007, whereas
the Academy of Management Journal, a top-tier journal, has published only 1,636 documents since 1975.

Citations and h-index overview

The average citations (137.2), FWCI (5.3), year (2007.6), and journal h-index (88.44) and complementary
descriptive statistics and correlations are presented in the Annex. The top five countries in terms of document
citations were Spain (745), Portugal (437), Brazil (315.7), Mexico (286.4), and Chile (242.4). The top five in
terms of FWCI were Spain (20.8), Colombia (20.4), Mexico (16.1), Portugal (11.7), and Brazil (7.6). Regarding
the top five countries in terms of their journal h-index, Chile (133.6), Uruguay (131.6), Bolivia (125.5), El
Salvador (124.2), and Portugal (123.1) had the most documents published in journals with a high h-index. It
was found that the methodological strategies of the 50 most cited documents were either quantitative (44%),
theoretical (35%), qualitative approach (13%) or mixed (8%).
Figure 3 shows a skewed citations distribution, as only 1% of the documents (n=2) had between 951 and
+1,000 citations, whereas 48% (n=94) had between 1 and 50 citations. The citations distribution is being
skewed daily. During a 2-week period (end of January and beginning of February 2018), 17 of the 20 most
cited documents received 2.2 citations on average. The outlier article among this group was: “A new criterion
for assessing discriminant validity in variance-based structural equation modeling”, which received five citations
(+1.3%).

Title text-mining analysis

A text analysis of the documents’ titles was conducted to pinpoint common themes that have been under the
research lens in the region. This approach has been widely used in Bib-BMA (Kostoff et al., 2001). Voyant
Tools was implemented: an open-source Web-based text reading and analysis environment that allows to
investigate patterns of words/concepts and to explore and visualize large bodies of text systematically, tasks
that would be difficult to perform manually (Sinclair and Geoffrey, 2016). Two analyses were conducted:
frequency of terms (i.e., the number of times a word is mentioned in a body of work), and collocation graphs.
A collocation graph is a network of terms with higher frequency and proximity. The keywords are shown in
dark gray and the proximity words are shown in light gray. Table 4 shows the results for the Top five
frequency of terms and Figure 4 shows the collocation graph.

Author overview

The average number of authors per paper is 4.34. In 48% of the papers, authors with an affiliation in the
region figured as the lead author. The average of documents and h-index were 23.6 and 7.36 respectively. A
document worth mentioning in terms of the number of authors is Culture-specific and cross-culturally
generalizable implicit leadership theories: Are attributes of charismatic/transformational leadership universally
endorsed? This document has more than twenty authors from countries around the world. The top five
countries by the average number of authors were Chile (8), Bolivia (7.2), Brazil (6.9), Guatemala (6.2), and
Paraguay (6.2). Spain, Paraguay, Colombia, and Cuba were ranked equal first in terms of lead authors (70%)
followed by Nicaragua (60%). The most productive authors in terms of the average number of documents
published in Scopus were from Panama (81.3), Spain (54.9), Chile (51.7), Mexico (49.8), and Portugal (36.6).
This landscape changed abruptly in relation to the average h-index of authors, where the top five countries
were Nicaragua (19.9), Paraguay (17.8), Panama (15.8), Chile (14.6) and Uruguay (11.3). Figure 5 shows a
skewed distribution in relation to documents and authors, as 1% (n=2) of the authors had published between
340 and 380 documents, while 55% (n=114) had published between one and ten documents.

Status and accreditation overview

Fifty-three percent of the organizations were private, while 47% were public. In the case of business schools,
only 32% are currently accredited by the AACSB. Private organizations dominated BMA publishing in Peru
(100%), Paraguay (90%), Mexico (90%), Costa Rica (80%), and Bolivia (80%). Conversely, the public sector
dominated in Venezuela (100%), Panama (100%), Dominican Republic (78%), Portugal (82%), and Uruguay
(70%). The top-ranked countries in terms of having at least one of the authors affiliated with an AACSBaccredited business school were Mexico (80%), Chile (70%), Portugal (70%), Guatemala (60%), and Spain
(50%).

Differences among university status in FWCI, authors’ h-index, documents published, journals’
h-index, leading authors, and open access.

Four ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) were conducted in Stata. The first was conducted to explore the
differences among institutional status on the FWCI (Table 5). There were two groups: group1: private; and
group2: public. The results showed that there was not a statistical significance in the FWCI at the p< .05 [F(1,
202)= .00, p= .96]. Therefore, public and private institutions did not differ significantly in terms of FWCI.

8). Considering the same two groups, there was not a statistical significance at the p< .05 in the journal hindex score [F(1, 202)= .66, p= .42]. In consequence, public and private institutions did not differ significantly
in terms of the number of documents published.

Discussion

Intellectual output in BMA in Ibero-America has been growing, but it is clear that Spain has been a
powerhouse in terms of both productivity and influence. Spain is also the top country in terms of the average
number of citations (745) and FWCI (20.8). Business schools in Spain have made a name for themselves, with
five being AACSB-accredited. There were also countries in Latin America such as Uruguay (131.6), Bolivia
(125.5), and El Salvador (124.2) that had articles published in journals with the highest h-index and with no
AACSB-accredited business school. However, despite the fact that authors from Spain are by far the most
cited in the region, they are hardly cited in BMA globally. For example, Garriga’s (the most cited author in
our sample) total number of citations was just 5% of the number of citations of the global-scholar Kathleen
Eisenhardt (Stanford University).
The predominant type of publication is the article, although the majority of the most discussed BMA studies
are secured behind a paywall. Researchers, institutions, students, practitioners, and policy-makers without
the significant resources required to gain access to the oligopoly of academic publishers in the digital era
(Larivière et al., 2015) are being excluded from the intellectual contributions in the subject. However, there is
no lack of these at present. Forty-eight percent of the journals in which researchers from the region have had
articles published are OA, Espacios, the most desired journal for BMA publishing, among them. Now, besides
being OA, Espacios offers other advantages such as the most cost-efficient peer-review systems. Ten out of the
32 articles published in vol. 39, No. 2 of 2018 were analyzed. The average number of words per article was
4,500 and the average time elapsed from manuscript submission to publication was 1 month or 6 days in two
cases. Authors must pay a US$150 fee, of which US$80 is refunded if the article is rejected. However, the
discussion should not be restricted to the prevalence of OA journals, but which journals have reached high
quality/ethical standards or should be added to the Beall's List. Alternatives proposed by experts such as
Isidro Aguillo (Webometrics Ranking Web editor) include the creation of an OA super-journal (e.g. Science or
Nature) for the region, crowdfunded by national science and technology institutions.
Regarding language, “global business speaks English” (Neeley, 2012). However, both Spanish and Portuguese
are not far behind as hub languages (Ronen et al., 2014). In terms of methodology, a question that arises is
whether the most discussed documents are being used as learning material. Considering that the most popular
pedagogical strategy in business schools is the case study (i.e., a qualitative approach) it was queried whether
quantitative or theoretical studies, which were the most popular methods among the sample (79%), are being
discussed beyond the BMA research environment.
As Podsakoff et al. (2008) argued, a highly skewed distribution of documents and citations also was found,
whereby a small percentage of documents (1%) were responsible for the majority of citations (951–1,000).
Moreover, this distribution is becoming increasingly skewed each week. This is another evidence of the
“Matthew effect” in science proposed by Merton (1968). The content analysis identified the most discussed
topics and the most cited papers within each topic, but there were some notable absences. For instance,
entrepreneurship is a topic on the international agenda (e.g., The Oslo Agenda since 2006 in Europe), but it is
still neither included in the BMA subcategories nor among the most cited documents in the region.

13

The advance in knowledge now relies more on packs than lone wolves. The average number of authors per
document has gradually increased from 2.7 in 2000 to 4.2 in 2015, an average annual growth rate of 10%. The
regional average is over 2.8 which was the average in the field of management (Acedo et al., 2006). This reflects
a trend toward global scientific collaboration (Wuchty et al., 2007).
In relation to document and author distribution, it was found additional support for Lotka’s law (i.e., the
number of authors publishing n papers is about 1/nc that of those publishing one paper), as just 1% of authors
had published between 340 and 380 documents. As mentioned earlier, a similar distribution is evident in
relation to document citations (Talukdar, 2011; Lopéz et al., 2016). Institutional status had no effect on
neither the FWCI, authors’ h-index, authors’ documents output, journals’ h-index, authors’ leadership nor
AO publications, but it did in AACSB accreditation. This finding supports Podsakoff et al. (2008) claim on
the effects of research expenditures and endowment assets on university publications impact. Public
universities and business schools regularly suffer budget cuts which constraint their capacity to maintain
research excellence and reputation (QS, 2013), a vital factor for achieving international accreditations such as
AACSB.
The impact factor is not free of controversy neither from its author nor the publishing elite (Callaway, 2016).
However, the paradigm persists among management scholars. A report published by the Academy of
Management (2017) found that the two most important indicators of scholarly impact are scholarly articles
in top-tier journals and scholarly citations in others’ research. The report also states that the least important
audience for scholars were students, which seems linked with the low positioning of teaching materials (e.g.,
case-studies) among out sample. As a final remark, non-traditional metrics, or altmetrics (i.e., citations on
Wikipedia, mentions in blogs or on Twitter [Altmetrics, 2018]) are being seriously considered and robustly
examined by bibliometric and scientometrics scholars (Hammarfelt, 2014).

Conclusions

BMA research in Ibero-America is passing through a throbbing period. It has achieved its highest overall level
of output in more than 20 years, but closer examination reveals a small number of powerhouses in terms of
production and influence (i.e., Spain, Brazil, Portugal, and Mexico). A detailed examination of those
countries’ research policies, incentives, research centers, allies, and business research support programs should
help to identify best practice for other countries in a region that exhibits numerous social and historical
similarities. The AACSB accreditation standards provide a good benchmark.
These practices should encourage researchers from the region to strengthen their competencies and intrinsic
motivation to enter into global discussions without discarding their local relevance (i.e., glocalizing research).
Hence, it is essential to move away from publishing in the most desired journals toward publishing in the most
relevant journals in BMA. A noteworthy discussion to be given in regional scenarios in this line is the creation
of an OA super-journal funded by national science and technology institutions to compete with the top-tier
journals. The content analysis showed that several topics on the global agenda (e.g., entrepreneurship and
sustainability [UN Global Compact]) have not been discussed in depth in BMA research in the region. It is
also crucial that those studies be used as learning material and discussed beyond traditional academic spaces.
The evident advantage of private over public business schools in terms of infrastructure, recruitment of
researchers, and research funding to pursue international accreditations and visibility, increase the already
existing gap between private and public institutions in Ibero-America. Public institutions have an
opportunity in the underexploited theatre of the (high-quality) AO. Besides the traditional measures for
monitoring impact, studies on altmetrics seem to consider a broader set of contexts in which BMA researchers
also could debate and disseminate their original research and insights.
The results obtained in this study provide a comparative analysis between countries which allows more
inclusive criteria for those with low production or impact in BMA. The OA database also allows researchers

14

and practitioners to replicate or triangulate the data in further bibliometric studies, to locate influential
researchers or organizations within countries, to identify future research allies, to study whether research
activities have been focused on the private sector, and to identify the most influential BMA journals in the
region. National science and technology institutions should also measure how close their countries are to other
countries in terms of output and impact. Critical topics that have barely been discussed thus far in relation to
the region could be identified as promising new research fields.
This study has two main limitations. Whilst Scopus is more inclusive that WoS in several BMA-related
aspects, public platforms such as Google Scholar and Dimensions, as the latter is gaining maturity, have been
showing its overlapping and broad reach by comparing with the former two. By starting the analysis in 1996,
accuracy over completeness was chosen. A considerable amount of documents published prior to 1996 were
not considered for this analysis. Future studies could compare the regional differences in terms of BMA
subjects between Scopus and WoS and other databases such as Google Scholar and Dimensions, specifically
by studying a greater time span (i.e., looking at data from prior to 1996). In addition, methodological
appraisals such as co-authorship or co-citation analysis, and altmetrics would amplify the understanding of
the researchers’ social capital and impact. Comparative analyses considering additional groups of countries
such as Eastern Europe or Asia would help to identify the framework in which the intellectual production
from Ibero-America has been finding its place in the global dialogue in relation to BMA.
