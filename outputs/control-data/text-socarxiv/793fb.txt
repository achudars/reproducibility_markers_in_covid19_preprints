"3" "Introduction"
"4" "British life was under intensive scrutiny and debate  in 1980 with concern about poor growth and rising inflation prompting a vigorous and wide-ranging discussion about both the methods and goals of public policy. In the previous year Margaret Thatcher inherited from Wilson an economy in the doldrums, failing essential services, results of chaos-inducting strikes known as “the winter of discontent,” International Monetary Fund (IMF)-mandated public spending cuts, and a balance of payments deficit.  For her, the problem was with the principle of social intervention, which is why her government called for radically new ways of rationalizing state-market relations—the essence of a reformist discourse we call “New Britain.”  On this view, the economic crisis had  forever punctured  enthusiasm for reducing class inequality to the detriment of individual energies and private enterprise. Labour-leaning elites and most of the masses did not see  statism   a catalogue of errors , however. Indeed, the dominant discourse on the political economy in 1980 was what  we call “Muddling Through ”—a commitment to broadly defined  Keynesian economics, which the nation  (“Modern Britain”)  had developed after war and which had far more to offer than was usually allowed during hard economic times ."
"5" "These two discourses exemplified the partisan/ideological divisions that  were regarded  as characteristic of contemporary Britain. However, these divisions did not apply everywhere. According to the texts surveyed,  although many agreed that the  cou ntry was slipping out of control and into financial ruin ,  most British people, the elites and the masses alike,  retained a positive view of  Britain’s power and influence in the world—from its  contribution to  the  Cold War and the UN to its  post-imperial status quo. Life under the aegis of American power, nuclear deterrence and NATO was better than goi n g-it alone in the world.  The same argument applied to European trade.   In short, Britain’s precipitous  d ecline did not necessarily mean  that Britain no longer  counted as a leading nation ."
"6" "Part  I: Text selection"
"7" "Our a rchive consists of texts sampled from  across  the following five genres:"
"8" "L eadership  speeches.   Like in 1950 and 1960,  the selection  was based  on a   combination of the  Queen’s Speech ,  which in 19 80  was  delivered in Parliament on 20  November, and the prime minister’s leader’s speech at a party conference . I n t he latter case, this was Margaret  Thatcher ’s s peech to  the  Conservative Party Conference  in Brighton on October 10, also known as “The lady’s not for turning,” a.k.a. “The Reason Why” speech ."
"9" "We collected   newspaper  items from  the  editions published on  15th day of every month  in the  left-leaning   the  Daily Mirror   and the  right-leaning   Daily Express .  According to some estimates in  the secondary literature,  The Sun  in 1980  h ad higher circulation numbers than the  Mirror . If so, the above choice relaxes the project’s selection criterion of  “select [ ing ]  two out of top three highest circulating national dailies.”   Consistent with previous UK reports, we excluded Sunday editions, which in 1980 fell on the 15th of June. Also l ike in earlier reports ,  we defined the category “op-ed” to include columns, editorials, opposite-the-editorial pieces and “letters to the editor” to cover both political and non-political commentary penned by the newspapers’ readership.  This time, however, there were more letters to the editor (122 discrete units of texts) than op-eds (81)."
"10" "Two  high school textbooks  covering aspects of modern  British history are   C.P. Hill’s  British Economic and Social History , the fourth edition, and Sked and Cook’s  Postwar Britain: A Political History , the first edition. Both text books were widely used in 198 0.  The former “ is not concerned with  the battles or with diplomacy,” but with “ British economic life, in trade, ind ustry, agriculture, and finance (p. 236).  We considered, but decided against, selecting Tony  Howarth’s   Twentieth centur y history: the world since 1900 ( 2nd  ed. by Josh  Brooman ).  Published by Longman, and “b y arrangement with the Br itish Broadcasting Company” as a television series for schools, the  Howarth  textbook was almost certainly the most popular in 1980 but we  did not use it because of the dearth of British content— none of its 48  chapter s covered exclusively Britain and only one of the corresponding BBC series programs was entitled “Britain Alone”, which was a section chapter in Chapter 30."
"11" "Out  selections  for  bestselling  novels were  The Devil ’s  Alternative  by Forsyth and  Wild Justice  by Wilbur Smith.  Although it is safe to say that both books were produced by an international publishing industry rather than a British one, what matters here is that the authors and their books count on all reasonable measures as “culturally British.”   Both novels  can be said  to belong  a spy sub-genre kno wn as “faction” (fact-fiction) and more specifica lly Cold War espionage faction.  Indeed,  Wild Justice  is set in contemporary  time,  and  Devil’s  in near future."
"12" "To select the leading UK-made movie  blockbusters of the  year  we  followed the rankings based on both reserved-ticked and general release data that appeared in  The Times  on 31 December 1970. Monty Python’s  anti-Biblical satire   Life of Brian  was number one, followed by  McVicar , a gangster movie based on true events cen tered on a famous prison escape.   Brian  was the fourth most popular movie on a box office chart dominated by  The Empire Strikes Back , while  McVicar  was in the top twenty category, ahead of the US-UK war movie  Yanks  and the rock film  Breaking Glass ."
"13" "II British Identities in 198 0"
"14" "Table 1 lists top identity categories, defined as the top 25 percent, by the raw count as recovered from the above archive (For  the complete  list of identity categories, see the project website.) On a broad view, Britain appeared to have both   strengths  and many more weaknesses .  Most weaknesses were economic  and were reflected in some combination of unemployment, rising prices, and the fact that the Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was squeezing virtually every public service budget in the country.  Whatever the angle, the elites and the masses agreed that  t he nation was  crisis-ridden :  economically depressed  and   declining  above  all, but also fearful of assorted terrorist attacks .   “Everything has gone wrong in Cold Comfort Britain,” declared the  Mirror  on  February 15 in its editorial on “the stench of unemployment.” Ten months later, the crisis only seemed worse, with political leaders appearing either unable or unwilling to address it (December 15)."

"235" "Importantly, n ational decline  wa s  understood  as moral and social  as well . No less than six letters in the sample  lament  the decline in ‘good’ B ritish manners on the part of, respectively,  the police,  government ministers, union leaders,  t elevision presenters, pubs, and  retail workers.  Also , this round of national decline was understood as qualitatively different. “ Britain was still attempting to be a world  power, without world resources,” explain Sked and Cook, referencing the 1960s (Sked and Cook 1979, p. 165).  But  it was only recently  that the  London  stock market experienced a   “ larger decline than had happened  after the Great Crash of 1929,” while i nflation was   “ uncomfortably h igher than in Europe or America” (Ibid., p. 333, 357)."
"236" "For  Thatcher  and the segment of the elite who supported her , the  main  culprit behind  the  persistent  national  malaise was  statism , coded here as the  top category.  The Queen’s s peech identified “ [t] he need to restrict the claims of  the public sector on the nation’ s  resources… to reduce the scope of nationalised and state industry, and to increase competition. ”   Concretely, the  government’s  set out to work towards denationalizing the national oil company and introducing “ oppor tunities for private investment” in transport a nd telecommunications (Ibid.)."
"237" "S tatism   was more  positively  evaluated  in the rest of the  archive , however.  In textbooks ,  the postwar welfare state  was portrayed  as a major political and social achievement , one that has been copied by other nations .  Sked and Cook describe the NHS as “an  almost revolutionary social innovation since it improved the quality of life  of most of the British people” (p. 45).  Newspaper items published in the Labour Party-leaning  Mirror   agreed with this view.  Certainly, the welfare state had its problems. The  National Health Service (NHS) , once the pride of British political ingenuity, was now characterized by “ lengthy wait times and  low quality service provision”  ( October 15, letter) and misallocation of scarce resources (February 15, letter).  That said, the dominant response was a call for more state intervention, not less—from  increasing  pensions for workers   ( April 15 )  or doing something about those Post Office deliveries (Ibid, letter; also see February 15, letter) .   Yet, even the  Mirror  occasionally accepted  that the welfare state  had to  be pruned . “ Public spending cuts are crucial to beating infla tion and bringing about Britain’ s  economic recovery,” argued an editorial published on   April  15.   An industrialist in  Wild Justice  puts it slightly differently:"
"238" "Co uld you imagine if we had a five-year wage  freeze,  and no industrial  action during that time?   It's  them or us, Peter. W e could get back to being one of the major industrial powers of the Western world. Great Britain! We could be that again."
"239" "The collectivist impulse of  statism  did not always translate into the same with  patriotism . On the score, the masses were divided, with the novels seeing it as a positive trait (but see under corrupt) and the movie  Brian  as negative. One scene:"
"240" "Brian:  Please, please, please listen!  I've got  one or two things to say."
"241" "The Crowd: Tell us! Tell us both of them!"
"242" "Brian: Look,  you’ve got  it all wrong! You  don’t  NEED to follow ME, You don’ t NEED to follow ANYBODY!  You've go t  to think for your selves!  You’ re  ALL individuals!"
"243" "The Crowd: Yes!  We’ re  all individuals!"
"244" "Brian:  You’ re  all different!"
"245" "The Crowd: Yes, we ARE all different!"
"246" "Man in crowd:  I’ m  not..."
"247" "The Crowd:  Shh h !"
"248" "Brian:  You’ ve all got  to work it out for yourselves."
"249" "The Crowd: Yes!  We’ ve go t  to work it out for ourselves!"
"250" "Brian: Exactly!"
"251" "The Crowd: Tell us more!"
"252" "Brian: No!  Tha t’ s  the point!  Don't  let anyone tell you  what to do!"
"253" "This satire is directed to all types of groupthink, including nationalism and religion, and  can also  be interpreted as supportive of liberal identity (not in Table 1)."
"254" "For the prime minister,   reform  was  a byword for privatizing state function and for shaking up the work-shy. “ Human dignity and self-respect are undermined when men and women are condemned to idleness. The waste of a country’s most precious assets - the talent and energy of its people - makes it the bounden duty of Government to seek a r eal and lasting cure ”  (the Brighton speech).  From this perspective, unemployment, forced or otherwise, was making Britain uncompetitive in the global economy , practically for the first time in modern history.   The panacea was simple: more discipline and harder work."
"255" "Elsewhere,  reformism   stood for the attempts to achieve ever-greater  fairness ,  justice , and civility . The  Victorian era , for example, was portrayed in a history textbook as the  nation’s  alter-ago: unhealthy, exploitative and unpleasant. The life of the inmates in the  country’s top Wakefield high security pr ison, an op-ed explained, is unnecessarily   brutish  because of poor policy—something that  Home Secretary Merlyn Rees  could and should change ( Mirror , September 15). As for the similar  penitentiary  in  McVicar , the conditions are relatively civilized. The prisoners have rights, and when they riot over the wearing of new prison uniforms, the warden still tries to reason with them: “ la ds, we’re all  gonna  lose on this. ”"
"256" "The Thatcher government’s  narrow definition of reform and reformism merely underscored the deep  partisan  divide in contemporary Britain.   The  pro-Conservative  Express  thus saw the perceived  turmoil in the Labour Party following Thatcher’s victory in 1979  as a  major opportunity   for the Tories (October 15, both an op-ed and a letter). The  Mirror,  in contrast, seized on what it saw to be a reversal of Thatcher’s political fortunes in March, when she failed to placate Yorkshire miners (March 15 )."
"257" "Judgin g by the letters to the editor published in  both  newspapers,  the masses  were  divided  over Thatcher’s reforms . Writing to the  Express ,  on e citizen urged the government to “buy back council houses” as a way of  aid ing  low-paid and unemployed workers  (September 15) —the precise opposite of the government’s policy . As for the new proposal for  voluntary social work,  one letter  concluded it was an “excellent idea,” while another de scribed as  something  “straig ht out of Alice and Wonderland,” suggesting that only in a magical kingdom would a government obligate unemployed individuals to engage in volunteer work as a way of demonstrating their worth (July 15, both letters)."
"258" "As in  earlier years, Britain once again self-identified as  class-based . Elite discourse normalized this as  a fact of life  everywhere, including in the countries of the Eastern bloc. In contrast, the working class thought the system  was rigged  against them, especially by the City, London’s financial district. Judging by a pair of letters published in the  Express  on October 15, 1980, students at elite public (private) schools like Harrow School and Fettes College were out of touch, and Prince Philip and the rest of “the privileged classes” were hypocritical. In  Wild Justice , however, “fine aristocratic features” are always a plus. Stride’s teenage daughter is an “old-fashioned English porcelain beauty” with a “sweet Victorian face” and “the classical English skin of rose petals.”  (Stride’s palatial family home has a name—Abbots Yew.)"
"259" "In the  right-of-centre elite  discourse,  trade  unionism  was as problematic as  statism .  In her Brighton speech, Thatcher  declared that her government was reforming  “ trade union law to remove the  worst abuses of the closed shop .”  The opinion pages in the  February 15 edition of the  Express  were devoted to trade union leader Arthur   Scargill  and his response to a  letter from a Welsh trade  unionist who asked whether he could expe ct a job when the strikes end. For the editors,  Scargill’s  error was to allow  for “force and undemocratic arguments [to win] the d ay.”  An  opinion piece published  in the  Express  several months later argued that the  government’s reform of the  state-owned and cash-strapped Britis h Rail would be successful  were it not  for  the rail union;  “some people in the  Labour  and trades union movement regard  nationalised  industries as their own property, rather than public assets” ( July 15 ).   On the mass discourse side, judging by the letters at least, there was considerable support for the strikers—see the letters on the miner  strike published on January 15 in the  Express  or those on the steel strike in the  Mirror   from April 15.  In  Wild Justice , in contrast, a strike at the  British Leyland Motor Company   is presented  as a problem solvable only via strike-busting right-wing violence."
"260" "Economic  weaknesses adversely affected Britain’s natural strengths, the foremost of which were   capitalism ,   democracy  and  orderliness .  The first category was understood as a system for  creating the largest possible economic space for  both individual and national  competition  and therefore for social, economic and even political progress. Some collateral damage was inevitable of course. A  letter to the editor published in the  Mirror  on April 15 expressed sadness about the tearing down of  Brighton ’s West  Pier  ( “our piers are a national heritage ”) but at the same time offered understanding that that “ enough cash to save it could not be raised .”  In  Devil’s , one character explains counter terrorism as a function of money : securing transoceanic tankers against terrorist attack was too expensive, hence we pretended only securing airliners mattered (Ch.12)."
"261" "Importantly, it was not always  clear that  democracy—a categ ory that seamlessly intersected with  freedom and human rights— came  before law and order .  T he pri son,  as portrayed in the movie  McVicar ,  or terrorism-ridden Northern Ireland, were clearly understood as needing less democracy, not more. Consider also the section of  Wild  Justice   where  Stride  is  court-martialed   for killing a wounded terrorist leader  in custody. There, this  “wild justice”  is portrayed  as an anti-dote to the all-too-liberal  British state   and  society .  In  Brian , terrorists are merely stupid: “We are the Judean People’ s Front crack suicid e squad! Suicide squad, attack !, ” screams Suicide Squad Leader, after which his team members all stab themselves. “That showed ‘ em , huh ? , ” he notes."
"262" "British  orderliness  was subject to exceptions as well. One example was excessive public boozing, apparently a  major   cross-class pastime.  “Hunting is a tradition for B ritish gentleman, like drinking and gambling ,” explains Wilbur in  Wild Justice ."
"263" "The evidence of decline notwithstanding,  Britain’s  influence  in the world  was  seen  as  palpable. In addition to democracy ,  orderliness  and “fine aristocratic features , ”  this influence was also a  function of  the nation’s   industriousness  and  scientific  ingenuity .  All of this  was clearly reflected  in military affairs.  Peter Stride , the extraordinary  hero  of  Smith’s   Wild Justice , is introduced as a man who hones his  terrorism-fighting  sk ills every day without a break. One night he practiced shooting until after midnight, turning his pistol into an   “e xtension of  his hand--either hand, left or right . ”  Forsyth’s  Devil  describes the British-made Nimrod as “ about the best aircraft for submarine and shipping surveillance in the  world ”  (Chapter 13)."
"264" "M uch like the elites, the British masses imagined themselves as morally superior  in the world .  One letter-writer offered a  “hurray for the Roman Catholic church in Birmingham for selling its shares in ten British firms suspected of infringing human right s in their factories overseas” ( Mirror,  October 15 ).  This is cou ld be interpreted as  evidence  of British citizens’  awareness of the inequalities faced by impoverished individuals and nations overseas).   However, it was also the case that the British actually misunderstood what moral superiority was  for . Indeed,  it was  rather  foolish to expect that a country in such a deep economic should help other countries before it helps itself:  “ why does the charity, Help the Aged, send the greatest part of its funds abroad when there are so many in need at home?”, asked the  Express  on April 15."
"265" "The mass-oriented texts  disagreed, suggesting that law and order were relative.   McVicar   presents its criminal protagonist as having  more than a few  attractive qualities .   Wild Justice  is  a story of   corruption.  A wealthy  business woman  explains to Stride that she does not use the word bribe: “this is a capitalist society, G eneral.  We prefer to talk about commissions and introducer’s  fees. ”  Later in the novel Stride uncovers   the existence of  a  powerful network  of   unscrupulous  men who rule  the world behind the scenes , a group of “politicians  and industrial leaders dedicated to restoring power to the hands of those fitted by training and upbr inging to govern.” Worse still, t he mastermind behind  all  of international terrorism named Caliph is none other than Stride’s boss  Dr. Kingston Parker , the shadowy American counter-terrorism tsar.  The  Devil’s Alternative  sends the same message. The fate of the millions is always subject the machinations of the powerful few, and the British state is not innocent: “ in 1946 as the British Foreign Office and American State Depart ment quietly conspired to  return the two million “victims of Yalta” to the mercies of Stalin .”  It is important to observe that we coded Britain as democratic twice as many times as corrupt (19 vs 10); for all the problems the nation faced in 1980, it did not appear that the British people thought Westminster and Whitehall   had  lost tou ch with “the people.”"
"266" "Another  natural  strength  of the British nation was its   long-standing  commitment to  education  and scientific discov ery.  Stride, the muscular protagonist of  Wild Justice , accumulates boo ks even if has “no time to read, ”  while the eponymous here of  McVicar  is shown on his cell bed reading  Alberto Moravia ’s  Woman from Rome .    The excellence of British universities was  always  celebrated,  not just  that of  the elite  Oxbridge  whose  ancient star continued to shine brightly even against the backdrop of the  ever rising  suns in America, but also of m any fine regional institutions  who absorbed ever-higher numbers of high school students.   Related, Britain’s world power  was further understood  as a function of constant  p articipation in  the top international research  networks  and the welcome the nation extended to  international students and  scholars ."
"267" "In 1980, everyone knew that  Thatcher was “ Britain’s first woman pre mier” (the phrase is from Devil’s, where the UK prime minister is a Thatcher-like character).  For the elite, this merely was a reminder that Britain was excessively  patriarchal —a top identity category again. O ne  newspaper  opinion piece  arguing that  “only when we have a true representation of women MPs will Westminster have a true connection with the nation – and Britain a real democracy” ( Express , April 15 ).  The same article then proceeded to defend this argument by pointing out that the Thatcher premiership was no indication of female empowerment: “[W]omen account for half of the country’ s population and 38 per cent of the workforce, ” but “ only three per cent of our members of  Parliament  are female ” and only “ 38 have served in Government a nd 12 have  reached the Cabinet.”  In assigning blame, the article draw attention the character of the House of Commons—a “man’ s club - organized and run as  such”—, as well as to “women’s attitudes to themselves,” namely their failure to resist   “ the accepted tradition that a women should tailor her ambitions to those of her husband.”"
"268" "In the business pages, the same newspaper published an opinion piece that dismissed a female business leader as “a blatant feminist when it came to selling insurance” (October 15, 1980), as well as a letter chiding the  NHS for misallocating its funds—paying for abortions but not heart-swap and kidney transplant operations (February 15).  In more mass-oriented texts, Britain  emerges as  a man’s country.  Both novels are excessively male-centric and articulate a social Darwinist world of competition involving powerful states and their tough-as-nails representatives—leaders, diplomats, spies, and military professionals.  In   Wild Justice ,  Stride  scrutinizes all women as sexual objects . They do not  seem to  object: “it is very nice to ha ve a man being masterful again, it makes me feel like a woman ,” says powerful baroness Magda  Altmann  to  him.   And  Stride cannot stand his “shapeless” ex: “ give  me a B o lshevik intellectual over a neurotic  wife any day .”   In  Devil’s , Munro discovers that one of Kremlin bureaucrats is his ex-lover, and then easily proceeds to recruit her as a spy for the West. (Munro later learns that he is himself a pawn.)   In contrast,  Brian   consistently mocks this toxic masculinity ( “ Wait till  Biggus   Dickus  hears of this ! , ” says  Pontius Pilate), albeit together with everything else .  A running  feminism-  and trans- mocking  joke in the movie is   on  Stans’s  desire to be a  woman and a  mother . One:"
"269" "Francis: Why are you always on about women, Stan?"
"270" "Stan: I want to be one."
"271" "Reg : What?"
"272" "Stan: I want to be a woman. From now on, I wan t you all to call me 'Loretta'."
"273" "Reg : What?"
"274" "Stan:  It’s  my right as a man."
"275" "Judith: Well, why d o you want to be Loretta, Stan?"
"276" "Stan: I want to have babies."
"277" "Reg : You want to have  babies?"
"278" "Stan:  It’ s  every man's right t o have babies if he wants them."
"279" "Reg : But... you  can’t  have babies!"
"280" "Stan:  Don’ t  y ou oppress me!"
"281" "Reg :  I'm  not  oppressing you, Stan! You  haven’t got  a womb!  Where’s  the f etus going to gestate?  You going to keep it in a box? [Stan s tarts to cry]"
"282" "Two:"
"283" "Judith: Here!  I’ ve got  an idea: Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not  having a womb - which is nobody’s fault, not even the Romans’  - but that he can h ave the  right  to have babies."
"284" "Francis: Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have ba bies, brother... sister, sorry."
"285" "Reg :  What’s  the  point ?"
"286" "Francis: What?"
"287" "Reg :  What’ s  the point of fighting for his right to have bab ies, when he can’t have babies?"
"288" "Francis: It is symbolic of o ur struggle against oppression."
"289" "Reg :  It’ s  symbolic of his struggle against reality."
"290" "The  press was mostly positive about  the monarchy , even on the understanding that the Royal Family stood for entertainment, not leadership. A particularly big concern in the letters to the editor sections of the two newspapers was Prince Charles and his readiness for the throne, should Queen Elizabeth abdicate). One person lamented the consequences of Charles potential marriage to Diana Spencer because of its impact on Northern Irish politics: “one would have thought that Northern Ireland had enough problems without the Protestants working themselves up over something that may never happen — Prince Charles marrying a Catholic” ( Express , July 15)."
"291" "This letter also  speaks to Britain ’ s ambiguous relationship to  religion.   Some texts, such as the Queen’s Speech or history textbooks, duly nodded to the country’s Christian roots or values.  F rom Sked and Cook , “ the  racial policies…of the  Afrikaaner  nationalists… had proceeded, despite their profess ion of Christian principles” (p. 198). Overall , however, and especially the mass-oriented sources, Christianity was  a thing of the past .  Brian  is a satirical film about  an  e pon ymous man from Nazareth who is  mistaken for a Messiah and thu s set on a life-ruining path . The  wild popularity of this movie shows that the British were keen to lampoon  religious  illusion s and double standards in 1980.  The fact that the  movie  was banned   by the Vatican and  in  some rural  part s of the UK— Cornwall , for example—only  added to its metropolitan popularity . One blasphemous scene:"
"292" "Brian: Who cured you?"
"293" "Ex-Leper: Jesus did, sir. I was hopping along, minding my own business, all of a sudden, up h e comes, cures me! One minute  I’ m  a leper with a trade, next minute my liveliho od’ s gone. N ot so much as a  by-your-leave ! “You’re cured, mate.”  Bloody do-gooder."
"294" "Another:"
"295" "Brian: I am NOT the Messiah!"
"296" "Arthur: I say you are Lord, and I should know.  I've  followed a few."
"297" "In the nation’s geographical imagination,  as recovered from our archive, “Britain”  mostly meant “England .” The nation’s capital  was  beloved and  despised at once, but undeniably “the city.” Accordingly, all other places, whether British or global, appeared to be burdened by provincial politics, morality and/or aesthetics.  One of the main divisions in  McVicar , for example,  is  between the prisoners , who mostly from  London ,  and the guards  of a maximum security prison in the Northern city of  Durham .  In one scene, two cockneys talk loudly  so that the  guards could hear them . One of them, Terry Stokes, insists that the Northerners are “fags”:"
"298" "Hey Billy, you heard the  news?   They’v e  discovered another daisy chain in the Durham Light Infantry …Found an ‘ole barrack load of ‘ em  stuck up each other… Su nk, to the nuts they were. They’re going to rename them y’  know. The Durham Bumpers. Ah, do love an arsehole these Geordies !"
"299" "( I n another scene , the prisoners  riot and then  defiantly sing the ditty “Maybe it’s because I’ m a Londoner . ” )"
"300" "On the opposite end from London was  Scotland , whose  education and gender relations  needed “improving”  (Queen’s speech). Wales was  also backward,  distinguished  in 1970  by its two development agencies—one general , one for rural Wales (Ibid.).  Northern Ireland was of course the worst of the three,  marked  as it was by terrorism  and also   “ the horrors  of urban terrorism”  (Sked and Cook 1979, p. 311). It was also hopeless: “ any solution to the problems of the pro vince seemed as remote as ever”  ( Ibid.:   364 )."
"301" "The  Irish , not just the IRA or Irish republicans, where threatening. Here is the voice of a  fictional Norwegian captain whose oil supertanker was about to  be hijacked  by seven Ukrainian terrorists:"
"302" "The man spoke like an Englishman, behaved l ike one.  But  Englishmen did not  hijack tankers, surely. Irish, perhaps? IRA?  But  he had referred to fri ends of his in prison in  Germany. Arab, perhaps? There were PLO terrorists in prison in Germany .  And  he spoke a strange  language to his companions. Not Arabic by the sound of it, yet there  were scores of different  dialects in Arabic, and Larsen knew only the Gulf Arab s. Again, Irish perhaps ( Devil’s , Chapter 11)."
"303" "Soviet ,  US , and  European  Others were all top five  significant Other  categories in 1980.  The main foreign policy goal  of the British state   in 1980  was  fending  off the  malignant influence  of the Soviet Union ,  Britain’s political antithesis. That summer Moscow hosted  “the KGB Olympics,” which were boycotted by the Americans and in which censorship and espionage was ram pant. This was  repugnant:  “As  Lord Car rington pointed out yesterday: ‘ The Soviet Union uses  sport cynically to demonstrate ‘superiority’  of the Sovi et system and Soviet politics.’ ”  ( Express , July15). The prime minister agreed, expressing a mixture of disgust and  fear towards the Soviet Other : “Soviet Marxism is ideologically, politically and morally bankrupt. But militarily the Soviet Union is a powerful and growing threat” (Brighton speech)."
"304" "The masses agreed.  The Devil’s Alternative , the year’s most outstanding novel in commercial terms and  set  in what was then the future (summer of 1982),  is primarily about the Soviets. The novel begins with  a  story of a  catastr ophic grain harvest . “[D] espite  its monolithic  appearan ce from outside,” Forsyth writes, the USSR “ has two Achilles heels. One is the proble m of feeding its 250 million  people. The o ther is euphemistically called ‘ the nationalities question ’ ” (Prologue).   But  there is a more immediate problem .  Rudin ,  the moderate  and seemingly anglophile  Soviet  leader is in danger of being overthrown by a  ruthless Politburo  faction  bent on going to war in Europe as a way of diverting attention f rom the grain shortage at home."
"305" "The  British  were taught  to worry about Marxism . This was not always so. The Sked-Cook textbook reminds the students that “ Michael Foot, for instance, could proclaim at the beginning of the 19 45 Parliament that Great Britain  stood at the summit of her power and glory because she ha d 'something unique to offer' – a middle way be tween Communism and Capitalism” (p. 55). By 1980, this middle had long disappeared.  The “truth” about the aforementioned union leader  Scargrill  was “that he is a revolutionary  Socialist ” ( Express , February 15 , letter).  B eing soft on terrorism had to do with the power of  the “extreme left of the British L abour , ”   suggested the other bestselling novel,  Wild Justice . There, one of the villains  goes even further , arguing that the “survival of the Western societies” was at stake : “ up to now we have had o ne hand tied behind our backs, while the reds and the extreme left and the members of the Thi r d W orld have had both hands to fight with  and a dagger in each one.”"
"306" "Britain’s closest friend  was once  again the US . The special relationship between Downing Street and the White House  was understood  as real: “ based on military realities as well as on sent iment and diplomatic expediency” (Sked and Cook 1979, p. 106).  In the  Devil’s,  th e U.S. president and the UK prime minister “knew each other well… Face-to- face they used Christian names , ”  while  the  Anglo-American  spy network is a “strange and  guarded  but ultimately vital alliance.”"
"307" "The U.S. alliance  was understood  as asymmetric  across all texts .  In the Sked-Cook textbook, Britain  is portrayed  as a rule-taker throughout the rise of  Pax  Americana . A sample:"
"308" "The ‘Big Three  powers, howe ver, were in fact the big two— t he USA and the USSR— p lus Great Britain ”  (p.55)."
"309" "The Americans adopted what in retrospect appears to be a curiou s double standard over questions  of international trade. They violently objected to the British system of imperial preferences and to the sterling balances accumulated by  Britain  during the war; yet they felt entirely free to defend their own high tariff barriers at a time when they h ad no possible economic rivals (p. 59)."
"310" "His first task, as he saw it, was to patch things up with America ....In  his first broadcast as Premier he declared, \"True partnership is based upon respect. We don't intend to part from the Americans and we  don't intent to be satellites.” (p. 156)."
"311" "In  Wild Justice , the other novel, Atlas Command is a n Anglo-American   counterterrorist organization  known  to no more than twenty people in the world. Tactically led by Stride, the  muscular British  major- general  of Atlas’ airborne Thor unit, the organization  is in fact steered by a piano-playing amateur philosopher in the Pentagon, Parker. The Hill textbook explains why this is the case:  “ The war of 19 39-45 radically altered Britain’ s position in the world. She was no longer a Great Power, in a globe in which only the U.S.A and the USSR were Great Powers. She was dependent on  American credit for survival,” explains the Hill textbook (p. 282).  In fact, this started already in World War I: “ To the United States Britain owed War De bts of some 850,000,000 pounds” (Ibid., p. 241)."
"312" "The British elites wished this was not so.  The Trident missile system, “ our independent nuclear deterrent ,”  was made  possible through cooperation with the US, and by agreeing to “ the stationing of  Cruise missiles in this country,” explained Thatcher to the Tory party audience in Brighton.  The  Mirror  had similar concerns :  “President Carter has a right to expect every help from the West in his struggle to free the American hostages in Ira n, but he mustn’ t expect blind obedience ” (April 15 )."
"313" "The U.S. alliance illuminated many aspects of Britain’s international position.   Although Britain understood itself as sufficiently  well-armed  for example,  the ir  country’s decline economic  woes  caused  constant foreign policy anxieties.  “We have no wish to seek a free ride at  the expense of our Allies. We will play our full part. We intend to maintain and, where possible, to improve our conventional forces so as to pull our weight in the Alliance”  (Thatcher’s Brighton speech). As for nuclear weapons, both newspaper  letters  samples offered examples of citizens fed up with  government  policy . “[B]y unilateral disarmament we can start to reverse the race to destruction,” suggested one citizen in the  Express  (October 15). Another, writing in the  Mirror , expressed anger: “in a TV interview about the possibility of a nuclear war, Home Secretary William Whitelaw remarked: ‘Of course people will die.’  Who the hell  does he think he is — God? What right has any government to make such a decision?” (August 15)."
"314" "The  press took an abiding  interest  all things American . A case in point is  the  gene ral election of November 1980 and the race  between Democrat Jimmy Carter and his Republican opponent Ronald Reagan. The opinion pieces and letters  to the editor expressed preferences for the former or dislike of the latter ( Mirror,  August 15,  letter;  Express,  August 15;  Mirror,  July 15 ).  Mass-level interest in the U.S.  was articulated in an  Express  op-ed on  Sir Freddie Laker’s  “ revolutionary air travel”: “ an  incredibly cheap  Skytrain  service  [that]  reduced th e Atlantic to the size of a pond , suddenly and dramatically making the United States ac cessible to virtually everybody [and]  making it increasingly possible for all to do a Columbus and make their own personal voyage of discovery to the New World .”  (August 15)."
"315" "The  US was both similar and different.  Frequently invoked s imilarities included freedom and democracy  but also  patriarchy (“ The only woman given a chance of selection is former Ambassador to Britai n  Anne Armstr ong,” said the  Mirror ’s July 15 reflection on the  Democrati c Party presidential primaries .). The differences were many, but perhaps most obvious in culture.  Following John Lennon’s  tragic  death in New York in December,  a letter expressed a fear that  Reagan , now the incoming president, would do nothing to change America’s strange gun laws  ( Express,  December 15 ).   Devil’s  portrays Americans as  too  materialistic and  too  religious  at once . In the author’s words,  “ the spiraling increase in U.S. oil consumption  [is]  based on the ordinary Ameri can’s conviction of his  God-given right to rape the globe’s res ources for his own comforts . ”   The U.S. is also too Irish, for that matter:"
"316" "He watched Colonel O’Sullivan lower himself into the seat in  front of him and begin  attaching his own life-support systems with accustomed ease. When the  radio was connected, the  Arizonan’s vo ice boomed in his ears."
"317" "“ You Scotch, Mr. Munro?”"
"318" "“Scottish, yes,” sai d Munro into his helmet."
"319" "“I’m Irish,” said the voice in his ears."
"320" "“You a Catholic?”"
"321" "“A what?”"
"322" "“A Catholic, for  chrissake .”"
"323" "Munro thought for a moment. He was n ot  really religious  at all."
"324" "“No,” he sa id, “Church of Scotland.”"
"325" "There was e vident disgust up front."
"326" "“Jesus, twenty years in the  US Air Force   and I get to chauffeur a Scotch  Protestant.”"
"327" "“Whatever God you pray to,  start now, and hold tight.”"
"328" "Britain’s relationship  with Europe  was  more complex. For one, there was a  major difference in valance between the friendly  but militarily weak  Western Europe and/or the European Community (EC) on the one hand and the threatening Europe that laid beyond the Iron Curtain. Southern Europe was in the middle of the  continuum, interesting for its climate but backward in terms of politics and the economy.   Within Europe, we coded  France  as the most significant Other.  The Hill textbook calls 18th century France was “ the most   civilised  country in the world” (p.202-3).  It was also a military and ideological rival: France’s militaristic  post-revolution  behaviour  at the end of that century set off a series of events that proved “ disastrous to  the reform movement in Britain” (p. 160)."
"329" "Today,  however,  France was an ally.  “ Bevin knew, on the other hand, that American cooperation was much more likely to be forthcom ing if Britain  and France wer e seen to be cooperating first,” is how Sked and Cook explain the 1946 Anglo-French treaty, adding that   there could be little  doubt of the fact that hostility  to Germany still formed the strongest common  bond between Britain and France” (p. 79-80).   That  all  being  said ,  France was decidedly  not  a model .  “ France, in particular, was difficult, insisting on an immediate British acceptance of the Commo n Agricultural Policy…” (Ibid., p. 299).  A passage in  Devil’s  about  the Amoco Cadiz affair , a big  1978 oil  spill ,  captures  a certain sense of superiority towards the European neighbor : “ the F rench refused to accept  our help, even though we had better emulsifiers and better delivery syst ems than they did. Their  fishermen paid bitterly for that particular stupidity. ”"
"330" "Britain felt   more  European  than before—at least in the elite discourse .  Sked and Cook note that in the 1960s “ Britain was still regarded by the British as he leading power in Europe and there was little expectation even in official circles that the Common Ma rket would amount to very much” (p. 169). In 1980, however, the UK prime minister was welcoming   G reece’s accession to full EC membership  (Thatcher’s Brighton speech ). That said, Britain did not see itself as being  of  Europe—consider the  Europeans’  “notoriously soft records with militant activity”  ( Wild Justice )  or their  under-investment in the military (Hill, p.300) ?  Indeed,  b oth  novels  configured   Europe  as  being too red  and too soft . Here is Forsyth, imagining a future clash with the Soviets in  Devil’s , Chapter 2:"
"331" "The military thrust would avoid the Italian and Iberian peninsulas,  whose governments, all  partners with the Euro-Communists in office,  would be ordered  by the S oviet Ambassador to stay  out of the fight or perish by joining in. Within half a decade later, they wou ld fall like ripe plums,  anyway. Likewise Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. Switzerland would  be avoided, Austria used  only as a through-route. Both would later be islands in a Soviet sea,  and would not last long."
"332" "And  here is Smith, through the words of his hero in  Wild Justice : “ A millionaire Italian liv ing in his o wn country had to be the earth’s most endangered sp ec i es after the  blue whale, Peter thought wryly” (Ibid.)."
"333" "In contrast,  Britain’s  Western  identity  was never once questioned  at either elite or mass levels. The Queen’s speech suggests that “the best hope of lasting peace lies in the effective maintenance of Western security” and Thatcher’s Brighton speech  states that  “The restoration of Britain’s place in the world and of the West’s confidence in its own destiny are two aspects of the same process.” The  Devil  novel, like Brita in’s leaders, defined the West roughly as NATO plus capitalism : “You are in Turkey. Y ou are in the West. You made it, ” says o ne of the protagonists; “ The cars are  Austins  and  Morrises , impor ted from England…Peugeots from  France and Volkswagens from West Germany. The words on the billboa rds are in Turkish. The  advertisem ent over there is for Coca-Cola.”  Maintaining Western unity was understood as paramount in the fact of the Soviet and other threats: “we simply cannot afford great fissures in the Western Alliance over  Iran,  or over Afghanistan” ( Express , April 15)."
"334" "Britain’s  defined its modernity and Western-ness in opposition to the  developing world , a.k.a., the South, which was seen as authoritarian and po orly governed, whereas Britain  democratic  and , broadly speaking,   well-governed.   The Queen’s Speech: “ serious economic problems…affect both developed and developing countries and will continue to work with other countries and international  organisations  in seeking to alleviate them.”   Like in previous years, the same speech mentioned the Com monwealth and the UN  in the same sentence, suggesting that the British elites were at ease with their country’s  post-imperial  identity.  (The Commonwealth, much like the UN, was a voluntary association of nations with shared interests.)  Both  textbooks offe red some correctives to this view . Examples:"
"335" "The basis of the whole business, the actual trade in slaves itself, was as simple as it was diabolical. Every year at a number of settlements on the West African coast, like  Cormantine  and Cape Coast Castle, there assembled crowds of wretched  N egros, men and women alike. Th ey  had been captured  in the ceaseless tribal wars, and  this was the penalty of defeat.  The victorious chieftains sold them like so many cattle to the slave-traders, who packed them on boar d their ships.  The profits from this trade went to English merchants, many of them respectable, God-fearing men living comfortable lives in fine houses in Bristol an d other towns (Hill p.59)."
"336" "the  independence of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon did, however, signify the emergence of a new Commonwealth and of a new  Commonwealth policy and spirit..   ...Despite the emergence of the new Commonwealth as a worldwide organization transcending the boundaries of race, colo ur and creed, no attempt  was made  by the Labour government  to develop it institutionally (Sked & Cook, p. 59-60)."
"337" "Judging by the novels and  Brian , however, the mas ses were tired of such lectures. Here one particularly  well-known  scene from the said movie:"
"338" "Reg : All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what ha ve the Romans ever done for us?"
"339" "Attendee: Brought peace?"
"340" "Reg : Oh, peace - shut up!"
"341" "Reg : There is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans  once and for al l ."
"342" "Dissenter: Uh, well, one."
"343" "Reg : Oh, yeah, yeah,  there’s  one.  But otherwise , we’ re solid."
"344" "Post-imperial developments created new problems at home as well. “ Commonwealth immigration into Britain increa sed dramatically after the war,” explain Sked and Cook, and already in the  1970s  there were calls for “ limits on immigration, culminating in the panic moves to sla m the door on the Kenya Asians” (p. 200, 284), especially among the Conservatives and their supporters (p. 304)."
"345" "The masses were aware of the changing demographics as well as of the darker side of their nation’s history. A letter in the  Express  from April 15 asked the British to pause over their own complicity in  Palestine ’s ongoing woes.  Wild Justice  makes it clear that the  British  state routinely “discarded the  right of habeas corpus ,” whether in the earlier counterterrorism campaigns in   Cyprus or Palestine or “n ow ” in the H block, the infamous section a Belfast prison built recently to house Irish Republican Army terrorists.  Importantly, the novel is not necessarily a critique. As  Stride’s  corrupt brother puts it : “those damned shop stewards up in Westminster may have thrown the empire away, but we st ill have our responsibilities.”"
"346" "Part II I Discourses  of British identity  in 198 0"
"347" "We interpret the topography of Britishness in 1980  in terms o f a contestation over p olitics and the economy, that is,  between “ Muddling Through ”—for “Modern Britain” was now  simply  muddling through— and “ New B ritain . ”  Identities not subject to  significant elite-mass disagreement  are grouped  under the rubric “No Contest” (Table 2)."
"348" "The disagreement between “Muddling Through” and “ New Britain ” was primarily about the political economy and specifically on the response to slowing growth and rising inflation .  The former , representing majority opinion among both the elites and the masses,  stood for small modifications to the status quo — Britain was not doing well but ne ither did the rest of the West.  On top of the  economy, this discourse  was dissatisfied with the nation’s  overall decline, class and gender hierarchies ,  corruption of the ruling elites,  as well as  unfairness and injustice . Some of these identifications  were not seen  as problems to be solved but rather challenges to be mitigated—decline, for example. Others  were not even seen  as challenges. In the mass discourse, for example, patriarchy and sexism were normal rather than abnormal. Furthermore, “Muddling Through” was proud of Britain’s democrati c and trade unionist traditions as w ell as of its education system. Finally,  disagreement  with New Britain  was se en  as merely the latest iteration of  long-standing partisan/ideological division s  chara cterizing the nation ."
"349" "Unsatisfied with the  complacency  of “Muddling Through , ”   “New Britain ”  argued for the abandonment of the Keynesian orthodoxy in economics.  Other targets in this discourse were  statism  and socialism,  which  were seen  as  tw in  atavisms of a bygone era.  More positively, “New Britain” saw the countries  as reformist,  hard-working , capitalist, still powerful, free, orderly, and competitive."
"350" "G iven  that  the debate about the wisdom of consolidating the market imperative at home did not actually translate i nto foreign policy discussions, it safe to say that  “No Contest”  shaped  foreign policy the most.  First, a part from the Soviet Union, the British feared the Irish and Irish Revolutionar y Army terrorists in particular. Second,  Britain was a strong supporter of the  UN  Charter vision of sustainable peace and common security, key principles of which are the right to security of all states and their peoples, and the primacy of conflict prevention and the peaceful resolution of disputes.  Britain was simultaneously a strong supporter of the U.S.-led Western alliance, starting with NATO but also including European integration, and an equally strong opponent of  the Soviet Empire.  Last but not least , the country understood itself as a leader of   the  still relevant  Commonwealth."
