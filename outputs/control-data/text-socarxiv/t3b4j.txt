Shall Not Be Infringed: How the NRA Used Religious Language to Transform the
Meaning of the Second Amendment
Jessica Dawson
United States Military Academy at West Point
Abstract
Understanding the deep meaning of the Second Amendment is critical to
understanding the deeper meaning of guns in American culture. The
centrality of the Second Amendment in American culture can be better
understood through the intersection of American nationalism with
Protestant Christianity. Understanding the transformation of the Second
Amendment from an important Constitutional amendment to an article of
faith in religious nationalism provides new insight about the meaning of
guns for American identity. This paper argues that the NRA has capitalized
on the religious nationalism that arose in the late 1970s alongside the Moral
Majority and has increasingly used religious language to shape the discourse
surrounding the Second Amendment. The use of religious rhetoric, such as
references to evil, illustrates the merging of American civic religion with the
New Christian Right’s rhetoric. Using issues of the American Rifleman to
investigate the changing discourse since the mid-1970s, this paper
demonstrates how the NRA increased its use of religious language to frame
the political debate about gun rights through a religious nationalist lens.

Introduction: Second Amendment and Religious Nationalism
Perhaps no other subject in America engenders the level of controversy and
intensity of emotions as the Second Amendment. Gun rights advocates and gun control
advocates occupy opposing positions on the political spectrum regarding the role of guns in
America. The Second Amendment has been a motivating force in American politics since at
least the 1960s, when violence shook the nation and a series of public assassinations lead
to a “moment of profound popular revulsion against guns” (Hofstadter, 1970, p. 9). Guns
and the Second Amendment have been widely studied in political, legal, historical,
criminological, and gender contexts, and recent studies have begun to consider gun in the
context of American religion (Mencken and Froese, 2017; O’Neill, 2007; Yamane, 2017a).
With the rise of studies of religious nationalism, the investigation of gun culture at the
intersection of religion and nationalism is a relatively recent development (Whitehead et
al., 2018). In this paper, I explore the NRA’s use of religious language to increasingly frame
the political debate about gun rights through a religious nationalist lens.
This paper contributes to the rich literature that has investigated the changing
meaning of the Second Amendment over time. The Second Amendment has been broadly
studied in political (Carlson, 2015; Horwitz and Anderson, 2009; Obert, 2018; Winkler,
2013), legal (Waldman, 2015; Winkler, 2013), gender (Dunseith, n.d.; Melzer, 2012; O’Neill,

2007), and historical (Burbick, 2006; Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018) contexts. Dunbar-Ortiz’s (2018)
Loaded: A Disarming History of the Second Amendment expanded on this rich literature and
demonstrated how larger social and political forces created the myths surrounding the
Second Amendment and the role of guns in American history. A major contribution of that
work was to situate these myths in the larger patterns of the violent control of native and
slave populations (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018; Obert, 2018). This historical context is critical for
any discussion of religious nationalism today, given the dominance of white Christian
nationalism in the current political sphere (Gorski, 2017a). Sociological studies of gun
culture and the Second Amendment are experiencing a resurgence (Burbick 2006; Yamane
2017b; Stroud 2016; Hovey et al. 2017). Recent studies have begun considering the role of
guns in American religious contexts (Mencken and Froese, 2017; Yamane, 2017a). Other
studies have analyzed gun-related texts for religious symbolism. Lamy (1992) analyzed
Soldier of Fortune magazine to demonstrate the presence of apocalyptic millennialism
(Yamane et al., 2018), laying the foundation for investigating the links between gun culture
and religious beliefs. Gibson’s Warrior Dreams (1994) also used Soldier of Fortune and
other gun magazines to explain the rise of paramilitary culture in the post-Vietnam years. I
expand on these studies to demonstrate how the NRA has increasingly used religious
language to shape its argument in favor of the Second Amendment—that is, that the right
to bear arms is part of God’s covenant with America (Gorski, 2017b).
The NRA’s role in transforming the Second Amendment to one of central political
importance has been well documented (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018; Halbrook, 2008; Melzer, 2012;
Waldman, 2015). Melzer’s Gun Crusaders provided an in-depth study of NRA members and
how the NRA as a social movement organization mobilized members with differing levels
of commitment during elections to protect gun rights through the political process (2012).
Melzer’s work revealed critical early links between the NRA’s shaping argument around the
Second Amendment and the use of religious nationalism. Members of the NRA leadership
have argued that “you would get a far better understanding if you approached [the NRA] as
if you were approaching one of the great religions of the world” (Melzer, 2012, p. 15).
Whereas much research on gun culture views the Second Amendment in a political and
legal context, I argue that the NRA has capitalized on the religious nationalism that arose in
the late 1970s with the rise of the Moral Majority and the New Christian Right (Wuthnow,
1990) and has increasingly used religious language to shape the discourse surrounding the
Second Amendment.
Before turning to the links between religious nationalism and the Second
Amendment, I summarize the political, legal, and cultural context in order to discuss how
the meaning around the Second Amendment has already been studied.
The Evolution of the Second Amendment
The transformation of the NRA from a shooting club to a gun rights advocacy
organization in the 1970s is well documented (Halbrook, 2013; Hovey et al., 2017;
Waldman, 2015; Winkler, 2013) and, because of space constraints, will be noted only
briefly here. Rising out of both the violence and high-profile assassinations of the 1960s,
Second Amendment hardliners diverged sharply from more moderate gun rights
advocates, arguing for principled opposition to any gun control measure (Knox, 2009).

Legislative Affairs (ILA), begun in 1975. He later served as the president of the NRA,
shaping the NRA’s political and legal efforts toward “Second Amendment absolutism”
(Hodges, 2015, p. 91)—that is, the unrestricted right of individuals to keep and bear arms.
Neal Knox was a subsequent director of the ILA and president of the NRA before being
replaced by Charlton Heston in 1997 (Knox, 2009); Knox remained a dedicated proponent
of gun rights until his death in 2005. Both Carter and Knox helped orchestrate the 1977
takeover of the board of directors in an event that would be known the Revolt in Cincinnati,
when members of the new guard pushed out old guard board members who were more
willing to compromise on gun rights. By focusing their efforts on electing congressmen who
supported gun rights as an individual right, the NRA sought to have this “God-given
individual right” protected by the legal system that they—and many Americans—view as
handed down by God through the Constitution (Bonikowski and DiMaggio, 2016; DunbarOrtiz, 2018; Gorski, 2017b).
Individual Rights
The key point of disagreement over the legal and historical framing of the Second
Amendment argues about whether it is rooted in “civic republicanism and militia service
[or whether]…it protected a bit more, including the right to own and acquire firearms for
non-militia-related purposes, such as self-defense”(Charles 2018, p. 302). The legal
strategy advocated by hardliners, such as Carter and Knox. centered on the goal of
enshrining the Second Amendment as an individual right (Halbrook, 2008; Knox, 2009;
Waldman, 2015). This argument was premised on the second half of the Second
Amendment and sidestepped the initial text of the amendment referring to the “wellregulated militia” (Waldman 2015). From 1980 to 1999, a “small collective of lawyers were
able to usher in a flood of individualistic studies so that they outnumbered the total
number of militia-centric studies by almost two to one” (Charles 2018, p. 301). This
individualized interpretation of the Second Amendment became known as the Standard
Model (Winkler, 2013).
Even if the Second Amendment did not enshrine an individual right in the
Constitution, “the individual right to bear arms has never depended on [the Second
Amendment]. At least forty-three of the fifty state constitutions contain language that
clearly and unambiguously protects the right of individuals to own guns” (Winkler 2013, p.
33). These are not modern legal provisions. In keeping with the individual right to keep and
bear arms already protected in the vast majority of states, the affirmation of this right at
the federal level was affirmed in the now-famous Heller case (554 U.S. 570 [2008]) argued
before the Supreme Court in 2008.
The individual rights argument is not unique to the gun rights movement. “The 14th
Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law” (MacLean, 2018, p. 14) was a
constitutional shift (Simon, 2004) that reframed how the Constitution would be applied.
States’ rights “yielded in preeminence to individual rights” (MacLean, 2018, p. 14). The
close of the 1960s resulted in a constitutional reformulation of the “central purpose of the
federal government […] to protect ordinary Americans not from abuse by state
governments, or from general economic collapse, but from acts of criminal violence by
other Americans” (Simon, 2004, p. 344). Not everyone was content with allowing the
government this authority, especially in the post-Vietnam years when the United States lost

its first major conflict and shattered the national self-image (Gibson, 1994) . This view of
the federal government as protector collided with the historical knowledge from the old
West that had “politically infantilized” individual citizens and subjugated white citizens
under the rule of territorial administrators (Obert, 2018, p. 201). Landmark civil right cases
such as Brown v. Board of Education eroded the community’s rights to decide who had
access to public spaces and instead required equality of access. Religious leaders, such as
Jerry Falwell, began invoking the language of individual rights (Bellah et al., 2007; Harding,
2000). Use of the individual rights narrative created a shared space for religious activists
and political activists (MacLean, 2018) to be joined by gun rights activists. Gun rights
advocates, then, argue that guns are the most straightforward way for individuals to
protect themselves from the failures of government
Religion, Politics, and Nationalism
Religion and politics have been intertwined throughout American history (Bellah et
al., 2007; Gorski, 2017b). Bellah and coauthors’ (2007) Habits of the Heart stands as the
seminal piece arguing that American civic life involves an element of religious obligation, a
stance that extends back through de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Two significant
criticisms of Bellah’s work are relevant to the current argument that religious nationalism
has changed discourse surrounding the Second Amendment. The first is that their work
focused predominantly on Protestant voices in American history (Yamane, 2007). This
criticism, however, enhances the current argument given its focus on the relationship
between the rise of the New Christian Right and the NRA’s rhetoric.
A second significant criticism of Bellah is that he did not clearly differentiate
between the civic religious tradition and religious nationalism (Gorski, 2017b). Gorski
corrected this oversight by clearly defining religious nationalism as the fusion of “religion
and politics, to make citizenship in the one the mark of citizenship in the other, to purge all
those who lack the mark and to expand the borders of the kingdom as much as possible, by
violent means if necessary” (2017b, p. 17). In the context of religious nationalism, the
Second Amendment serves as a means to protect the right to engage in violence (Gorski
and Türkmen-Dervişoğlu, 2013; Obert, 2018). More recently developed measures of
Christian nationalism have shown that it is a significant predictor of attitudes toward gun
control (Whitehead et al., 2018).
The rise of religious nationalism serves as a counterweight to secular nationalism,
which “contends that the authority of a nation is based on the secular idea of a social
compact between equals rather than on ethnic ties or sacred mandates” (Juergensmeyer,
2006, p. 358). Religious nationalism can be traced back to the founding of the nation
(Craven, 2017; Juster, 2018), but the current merging of religion and politics arose from the
turbulence of the 1960s, coming into full political force with Moral Majority founded by
Jerry Falwell in 1979 (Wuthnow, 1990). Although the New Christian Right as a social
movement was an influential force in American politics in the 1980s, the Moral Majority
did not survive beyond a single decade. Nevertheless, the political decedents of the New
Christian Right that emerged from it remain a powerful force in politics to date (Bowman,
2018; Gorski, 2017a; Woodberry and Smith, 1998), despite declining religiosity reported
across all religious groups in America (Chaves, 2011; Hadaway et al., 1993).

1980s to the Present: The Political Rise of the New Christian Right and the NRA
The rise of the New Christian Right in the 1980s provides the backdrop for the
present study. Following Watergate, the 1970s were racked with significant ethics
investigations at the highest levels of government, seeding concerns in conservative
communities about a nation in moral decline led by an untrustworthy government
(Wuthnow, 1990). Moral decline is at the center of the nationalist narrative (Gorski,
2017b). The NRA rose to exceptional political power under Harlan Carter’s leadership,
joining the New Christian Right in capitalizing on the conservative backlash against the
liberal gains of the 1960s (Melzer, 2012). Both the NRA and the New Christian Right see
America’s problems as evidence of moral decline (Whitehead et al., 2018). The New
Christian Right in the 1980s was something never before seen in the field of religion and
politics: a group that was “morally outraged, socially engaged and routinely politically
active” (Harding, 2000, p. 81). The New Christian Right similarly mobilized voters on issues
surrounding morality. As Harding (2000) wrote, “morality and politics were being
discussed in the same breath” ( p. 202). The New Christian Right focused on absolute
obedience to God’s laws as the solution to the moral decay in America. According to this
view, obedience to the word of God would stay God’s hand in passing judgement on the
nation (Harding, 2000; Wuthnow, 1990). The NRA mirrored this focus by casting the
Second Amendment as a God-given right whose infringement would bring disaster to the
nation (Hodges, 2015). Ronald Reagan became the first president to address the NRA and
to receive an NRA endorsement. It has been widely argued that Reagan would have lost the
election if not for the concerted effort of the Moral Majority (Harding, 2000; Wuthnow,
1990), although the actual influence of this group remains contested (Woodberry and
Smith, 1998).
The political turn toward Second Amendment absolutism was enabled by the NRA’s
ability to link “threats to gun rights and broad social and structural changes and cultural
representations linked to gender and race relations…if people perceive that their rights,
status, and identity are threatened, they will be motivated to act” (Melzer, 2012, p. 67).
Indeed, the NRA has been incredibly effective in building on the Moral Majority–prompted
culture wars (Harding, 2000; Woodberry and Smith, 1998; Wuthnow, 1990) by grafting
gun rights onto larger cultural issues. Although the actual risk of adopting gun control
legislation was at its highest in the 1960s following high-profile assassinations and rising
violence (Waldman, 2015; Winkler, 2013), substantive gun control legislation at the
national level was not passed until the Clinton administration in 1993/1994 (Dunbar-Ortiz,
2018). The subsequent association of Democrats with gun control and Republicans with
gun rights helped speed the sorting of America into “red” and “blue.” Further, over the last
40 years, political affiliation has emerged as one of the most significant predictors of
religious affiliation (Chaves 2011). This political and religious sorting enabled the NRA to
use religious rhetoric in order to link the Second Amendment to Christian conceptions of
what it means to be an American (Bonikowski and DiMaggio, 2016) without worrying
about alienating potential voters.

Recent research suggests that gun ownership is negatively associated with
religiosity (Mencken and Froese, 2017) and provides alternative ways for men to feel more
valuable to their family and community. Gun ownership is not explained solely by religious
or political culture (Stroud, 2016; Yamane, 2017b). Rather, gun ownership offers a sense of
“moral purpose to white males who have lost, or fear losing, their economic footing”
(Mencken and Froese, 2017, p. 22). In this way, the Second Amendment provides a sense of
identity that is both religious and patriotic without being explicitly tied to any one
organization or denomination. Guns offer a source of identity comparable to a sense of self
previously rooted in religious identity (Carlson, 2015; Yamane, 2017a; Yamane et al.,
2018). This identity as gun owner serving as a valued member of community is not new: it
is related to an older form of civic obligation, particularly prevalent in the South in the form
of slave patrols and militia membership, that “linked private effort [with] public order”
(Obert, 2018, p. 148).
Following the Civil War, the military served an important role in enforcing national
boundaries through the use of the conquest narrative: both physical boundaries through
the use of force in establishing the nation in the American West, and symbolic ones through
enforcing, however briefly, the political participation of freedmen in the South during
Reconstruction (Obert, 2018). The “basic formula for religious nationalism in American
history has been apocalyptic politics plus the conquest narrative” (Gorski, 2017b, p. 19).
The conquest narrative focuses on the conquering of land for the Israelites and “legitimates
political violence, particularly violent forms of nation building” (Gorski, 2017b, p. 21). The
conquest narrative provides both a religious and a nationalist justification for the central
importance of the Second Amendment by arguing that the it preserves the right of the
individual to engage in violence to defend “true Americans” from evil of a tyrannical
government or other threats to security.
Religious nationalism, then, finds fertile ground in “white respondents who have
undergone or fear economic distress tend to derive self- esteem and moral rectitude from
their weapons” (Mencken and Froese, 2017, p. 2). This same population “threatened by
rapid cultural and economic changes” may be more susceptible to “nationalist political
appeals” (Bonikowski, 2016, p. 19.7). Education becoming increasingly associated with
radical secularism (Gorski, 2017b) has influenced the idea that conservative national
identities are “explicitly delegitimized by the educational system” (Bonikowski, 2016, p.
19.7). Thus, the resurgence of religious nationalism at a time when white Christian
Americans felt (accurately or not) deep institutional insecurity about their status in
America is unsurprising (Am et al., n.d.; Figlio, 2018; Hedges, 2008; Whitehead et al., 2018).
Gun ownership in America is strongly associated with Protestantism, in a complex
relationship that may be impossible to disentangle (Yamane, 2017a). Conservative
Protestants tend to be much more literal in interpreting the Bible, arguing for a plain
reading of the text (Harding, 2000; Wuthnow, 1990). This approach can be clearly seen
with regard to the NRA’s emphasis on the plain reading of the Second Amendment’s
language “shall not be infringed” and the emergence of Second Amendment absolutism
(Hodges, 2015). On the face of it, the structure of beliefs surrounding the Second
Amendment maps onto several well-developed measures of Protestantism: (1) authority in
the Bible and (2) the belief in the sinful nature of humanity, Protestantism is also
significantly more individualistic than other Christian traditions (Weber, 2001; Woodberry
and Smith, 1998). The trust in inerrancy of the Bible is a generally accepted measure of

religiosity, particularly among Evangelical Protestants (Chaves, 2011). The absolute faith in
the Scripture is not tempered by education or reason. Viewing the Second Amendment as a
“God-given right” that “shall not be infringed” echoes in many ways the Biblical injunction
not to alter the text in any way lest the person doing the altering find a sure pathway to
Hell.
America has always been exceptional in the belief that the Constitution serves as a
covenant with God (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018). Whereas the Bible serves as the sacred text for
Christians, the religious nationalist draws on the civic religious canon in which the “gospels
are the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution” (Gorski, 2017b, p. 31). The
10 original amendments to the Constitution serve as the new Ten Commandments “handed
down by God” (Melzer, 2012, p. 14), and here the role of biblical narrative in the NRA’s
transformation of the Second Amendment plays a pivotal role.
Data and Methods
To measure the NRA’s use of religious language and how it has changed over time, I
conducted a discourse analysis of the NRA’s longest-running and most far-reaching
publication, the American Rifleman. By investigating the cultural meaning of religious
language embedded in this publication, I aim to measure “the typical interpretation of some
type of object or event evoked” by the text (Strauss, 2012; Strauss et al., 1997). By reading
the American Rifleman through a religious lens, I follow Geertz’s insight that “meanings are
socially established” (Geertz, 1973; Strauss et al., 1997, p. 15). These shared meanings can
and should be evaluated in broader cultural context of the American political and culture
wars of the last 40 years. Critically, however, shared meanings cannot establish causality
regarding the actual beliefs of individual NRA members. Instead, I investigate how the
meaning surrounding the Second Amendment has been shaped by the elites of an
organization.
Discourse can be studied without making claims about the beliefs of individuals
(Strauss, 2012; Strauss et al., 1997). Although significant potential criticisms surround
discourse’s ability to illuminate beliefs and values (Swidler 2003; DiMaggio 2014),
evidence suggests that discourse can illuminate “patterns and structures” of social life
(Wuthnow, 2011, p. 6). Through framing selection, discourse is able to enhance
communication and emotional transmission of meaning (Benford and Snow, 2000). The
similarity between social movements and religious movements (Hannigan, 1991) suggests
that applying discourse analysis to religious texts can illuminate “social practice –
patterned by the social institutions in which it is learned and…practiced…[and]
internalized so that these rules often do not require conscious deliberation and yet
observable in the structure and content of the discourse itself” (Wuthnow, 2011, p. 7).
The data for this research come from the corpus of the American Rifleman, the
official magazine of the NRA that’s been consistently published in its current form since the
early 1920s (O’Neill, 2007). An examination of the American Rifleman presents an
opportunity to study the current emergence of religious nationalism in America, primarily
because it is targeted toward broad NRA membership, rather than at core Second
Amendment supporters like other NRA magazines (Melzer, 2012). As the longest-running
NRA publication, the American Rifleman is representative of how the organization has
communicated to its broadest base of readers and provides an ability to measure change

over time. The American Rifleman has been in continuous circulation since 1923 under its
current name (O’Neill, 2007), and its circulation represents one of the top 50 magazine
distributions in the country (Waldman, 2015), even in today’s increasingly digital
environment. The NRA states that more than 2 million subscribers currently receive the
American Rifleman every month (Keefe, 2018). The American Rifleman publishes 12 issues
per year and has some long-running repeating columns, such as “The Armed Citizen”
(1920s), “Standing Guard” (1991), and “Dope Bag” (1977).
The American Rifleman includes transcripts of major speeches given at the annual
conventions each year, as well as presidential addresses focusing on key issues. The year
1977 marks the formal demarcation between the more moderate, old guard of the NRA and
hardliners who pushed them aside to gain control of the NRA during what is known as the
Revolt at Cincinnati (Waldman, 2015; Winkler, 2013). The new guard, led by Harlan Carter,
focused on Second Amendment absolutism (Hodges, 2015; Melzer, 2012). This new focus
on “shall not be infringed” reflected a long-term vision of Second Amendment absolutism
for the NRA. While the debate about the nature of the Second Amendment and the NRA’s
role as an advocacy organization predates the 1970s, I argue that the religious nationalist
transformation of the Second Amendment coincides with the rise of the New Christian
Right. Reflecting the timing of the NRA’s deliberate shift into political influence, this
research focuses on a lexical shift from 1975 to the present, beginning two years prior to
the 1977 Revolt at Cincinnati. In addition, 1975 marks the founding of the NRA’s Institute
for Legislative Affairs, the nonprofit organization focused on electing Second Amendment–
friendly congressional representatives (Bruce and Wilcox, 1998) as well as the official end
of the war in Vietnam. I begin with 1975 to show that the transformation of discourse
toward more religious language was not employed as frequently prior to the 1977 takeover
in Cincinnati or the 1980 rise of the New Christian Right. This approach allows an
exploration of how the NRA’s discourse evolved from political language to religious
nationalist framings. I am not suggesting that such discourse did not exist prior to 1977,
however, only that it shifts significantly after 1977.
My sample includes every issue from January 1975 to December 2018: a total of 516
issues. Digital editions beginning with January 2008 were downloaded from a digital
archive. Physical editions were accessed through library archives or purchased from
collectors through online vendors, such as eBay. Physical editions were scanned using
Adobe Scan to create digital editions and were then optimized for text analysis using
publicly available optical character recognition software, ABBYY FineReader. Where optical
character recognition was unclear, the actual text was read and selected passages were
transcribed. Issues average approximately 100 pages in length, with election-year issues
being about 20% larger.
I use a mixed-methods approach to analyze the corpus of the American Rifleman from
1975 to 2018. First, I familiarized myself with much of the language that appears in the text
as well as in other NRA-centric media, such as video ads, focusing on how various NRA
spokespeople currently discussed Second Amendment. I also searched for language used in
fundamentalist Christian discourse paying attention to the narrative style of moralizing
sermons (Harding, 2000; Luckmann, 2003).
Building on Morning (2008), I then coded results for direct discussions of the Second
Amendment tied to religious discourse. These often involve discussions of “God” and “Godgiven” rights. Indirect discussions focus on links between religion and nation (e.g., “God

bless” or “thank God”). Finally, I coded for implicit discussion related to the religious
nationalist discussion of the Second Amendment. Use of religious language, such as
references to mountains and sacrifice, and other metaphors create frames that may
resonate more with right-leaning audiences (Lakoff, 2004).
I focus on direct and indirect discussions using textual analysis that focuses on the
increasing use of religious language for two reasons. First, it is impossible to know what the
readers of the American Rifleman believe; however it is possible measure the text they are
reading and make assumptions about the role of the NRA in influencing the links between
religion and nationalism. This approach offers a contextualized assessment of religious
language (Engler and Gardiner, 2017) surrounding the Second Amendment as opposed to
measuring the inherently sacred properties of the Second Amendment itself. Second, direct
and indirect discussions are “particularly suited to marking trends over time because they
are relatively objective indicators” (Morning, 2008, p. S115) of the changing use of religious
language surrounding the Second Amendment over time.
Reading the American Rifleman as Religious Text
With the success of the Civil Rights movement in the Jim Crow South, groups such as
the NRA and the New Christian Right began to study how rights were invoked and how
laws were used to challenge or protect these rights in the courts (Waldman, 2015). The
New Christian Right was explicitly focused on expanding civil rights for Christian
Americans, modeling their actions on the success of the Civil Rights movement (Harding,
2000; Wuthnow, 1990). After seeing the Civil Rights movement’s legal and legislative
success, Falwell stated that he “hoped Christians would have the kind of backbone to stand
up for their rights that Civil Rights people had” (Harding, 2000, p. 22). Human, and by
extension civil, rights became formally recognized by the international community through
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 (Joas, 2013; Moyn,
2010).
The NRA, however, has not linked rights to the UN Declaration but rather draws
their conception of rights directly from God. The NRA’s tying of human rights back to God is
not merely a marketing trick by the NRA. Joas (2013) traced two streams regarding the
emergence of human rights: one that extends back through the Enlightenment and pure
reason, and another that traces back through Christianity.

Figure 1 shows the changing frequency of the word “God” in the American Rifleman
from 1975 to 2018. The figure shows that just as religious nationalism did not completely
appear on the political scene in the late 1970s, references to God appeared more frequently
following the 1977 NRA takeover by hardliners but were not entirely absent in the years
prior to Harlan Carter’s leadership. Direct references to God increased in the mid-1990s,
appearing after a reshuffling of the NRA board of directors and removal of some of the
hardline “extremists” (Knox, 2009, p. 366) by LaPierre and his supporters. The NRA
leadership frequently thanked God, who is often viewed as a shepherd leading the flock
through dark times, a reference to Psalm 23. As Melzer noted, in-person references to God
are never “tongue in cheek” (Melzer, 2012, p. 13) but are reflections of sincere belief. “God
bless” is almost always used in reference to NRA leadership, America, or political leaders.

Figure 2: Frequency of "God-given" in the American Rifleman from 1975 to 2018
Figure 2 shows the increasing use of “God-given” from 1975 to 2018 as well as the
changing associations of God-given with rights, to bear arms and self-defense. Usage of
“God-given” in the 1980s was tied to shooting ability and raw talent, a usage that
reappeared in the discussion of Charlton Heston’s talent in 2008. The sole 1990 instance is
tied to stewardship of the land, a usage that did not reappear in subsequent issues. In 1994,
there is an explicit focus on trading a “God-given right to a government granted privilege”
(American Rifleman, 1994), emphasizing the elevated status of something granted by God
as opposed to protected by government.
On the face of it, this phrase views rights not granted by government or humans but
instead as descending straight from the Creator. “God-given” appeared in the American
Rifleman approximately 64 times since 1975, but the frequency of its use was inconsistent
over time. Harlan Carter appears to have been one of the first to use the term in the
American Rifleman, two years after the takeover in Cincinnati by Second Amendment
hardliners (Melzer, 2012).
Our NRA Members stand foremost in the struggle to protect and preserve all
our God-given, constitutional and long-accepted rights. We stand foremost
among those who see and recognize clearly the unfailing mix and
combination of those rights with the right of the people to keep and bear
arms. (Carter, 1979, p. 55)
Figure 2 shows that the use of the phrase “God-given right” dramatically increased
beginning in 2008, coinciding with the rise the concealed carry movement (Carlson, 2015;
Stroud, 2016; Yamane et al., 2018). It is not merely the frequency of the phrase that
demonstrates the lexical shift but also its usage explicitly with reference to bearing arms or
self-defense.

“The American people...will never surrender their right to protect
themselves, defend their families and defend their freedom here in the
United States of America,” [LaPierre] proclaimed. "The National Rifle
Association will always defend that God-given birthright from every enemy
out there, both foreign and domestic!” (NRA Staff, 2009, p. 84).
The subsequent frequency of “God-given right” after April 2008 could be
deliberately linked to President Obama’s ascension to the White House, a president who
was deeply unpopular in certain parts of the country and was suspected of not being a
legitimately elected official (Carlson, 2015; Stroud, 2016). Additionally, for some, a black
man in the Oval Office was seen as a deep moral violation and signaled that the government
no longer worked for them perceived average (white) Americans (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018).
The NRA has explicitly invoked the Second Amendment as a “God-given right”
deliberately to remove it from the bounds of legal authority of the state. The “Standing
Guard” column, begun after Wayne LaPierre was elected as the executive vice president in
1991, offers an example of the rhetoric depicting the Second Amendment as beyond the
reach of the government.
…men and women who care about their safety will never let themselves be
shamed, ridiculed or accused of being “unreasonable” for defending their
God-given right to defend life and limb. We’ve proven it over and over again,
and we’ll do it again on Election Day. So let this be a declaration to America’s
leaders: You have no right, no reason and no authority to deny us the
protection that the Second Amendment alone guarantees. (LaPierre,
November 2014, emphasis added)
This deliberate denial of the government’s authority draws on both a literal,
originalist reading of the Constitution and the idea that the Constitution stands as a
covenant between God and the American people. It evokes a religious nationalism that
cannot be restrained by the authority of the very government it claims to support and
seeks to restrain the government’s ability to force individuals to adhere to policies they
disagree with (Bowman, 2018; MacLean, 2018). By invoking religious nationalism, the NRA
moved more mainstream, appealing to a broader themes in American nationalism
(Bonikowski and DiMaggio, 2016) of voters beyond the single-issue gun rights voters
(Melzer, 2012).
Heston’s Use of the Moralizing Sermon
The figure of Moses and the Exodus narrative is prominent in American religious
history. The Puritans saw themselves as fulfilling their role as new Israelites, setting out for
the promised land. NRA leadership has been likened to Moses, building on the prevalence
of the Exodus narrative in American religious discourse (Gorski, 2017b). A figurative
Moses, NRA President Charlton Heston was instrumental in the movement of the NRA to
the mainstream. Heston’s faith was always prominent and was reflected in many of the
roles for which he is remembered, specifically Moses in the Ten Commandments. Heston
used his iconic imagery and powerful oratory skills to invoke the link between the Second

Amendment and God and to solidify it for the faithful. By using spiritual language toward
that end, Heston successfully linked his image in the American psyche as Moses to the new
American Ten Commandments (Melzer, 2012). “God gave us Moses [referring to Heston].
Heston…is the reason the NRA has moved into the mainstream” (Melzer, 2012, p. 13).
Heston’s portrayal of Moses was significant in several deeply American ways. The
Exodus story figures prominently throughout different periods in American history
(Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018). For example, the Pilgrims saw themselves as part of the Exodus
story, fleeing a repressive England for their faith. Martin Luther King Jr. frequently invoked
the Exodus narrative in his marches for freedom in the Jim Crow South. Heston’s portrayal
of Moses built on a deeply held American belief of persecution by an unjust government
(Gorski 2017). His charisma, reflected in his oratory skills and his statesmanlike
appearance, his association with his archetypical portrayal of Moses, and his well-known
personal faith enabled him to lead the NRA membership out of the darkness of LaPierre’s
earlier missteps as well as guide the membership through the storm following the
massacre at Columbine High School in 1999 (Cullen, 2010).
Charismatic leaders possess the greatest potential to change society (Parsons, 1993)
and to shape conceptions of the sacred. As part of the sacralization process, the charismatic
leader identifies something new and central to the belief system. As Lewis and Hammer
(2011) wrote, “in Weberian terms, emergent movements typically gather around
charismatic figures” (p. 4). Charlton Heston filled this role for the NRA and used his
charisma to declare a crusade to save the Second Amendment. His rhetoric, however, was
not merely powerful speech but deliberately invoked religious language and metaphors. In
the September 1997 issue of the American Rifleman, Charlton Heston declared “My Crusade
to Save the Second Amendment” (Heston, 1997), echoing Billy Graham’s “Crusades for
Christ” a generation earlier (Wuthnow, 1990).
He used rhetoric recognized by Christian Americans, including a reference to joining
him in the arena—a metaphor drawing on the biblical story from the book of Daniel about
believers being fed to lions for refusing to reject their beliefs (Harding, 2000).
As the 21st Century dawns, I won’t stand by and watch the Second
Amendment die. Wayne LaPierre asked me to come back to the arena. It is
my time – and it is your time – to serve. (Heston, 1997, p. 12).
Heston invoked religious language in suggesting that the Second Amendment
and the Bill of Rights were handed down to America by God, building on deeply
American traditions (Bellah et al. 2007 Heston 2000a). .
You cannot evoke the spirit of this sacred text without remembering
that the script bears deep, deep scars. Friendships, families, even the
greatest of nations have been torn apart over the principles these
words so carefully spell out. Young and old, rich and poor, men and
women of all races and creeds and religions all over the earth have
stood tall – or sunk lifeless to the ground – embracing the weight of
these simple truths. (Heston, 1997, p. 32)

His reference to the “spirit of this sacred text” speaks to the Pentecostal element of
the “new Christian chimera” that was “part fundamentalist, part Pentecostal, part
charismatic, part evangelical” (Harding, 2000, p. 80). In stating that there is “something
inherently special about our nation” (Heston, 1997, p. 32), he implicitly referenced the
belief that the Constitution is a new covenant between God and the American people
(Dunbar, 1998; Gorski, 2017b).
In his “Crusade” article, Heston assumed the role of witness. “Witnessing, like
evangelistic preaching, ‘is intended to create a spiritual crisis by calling to the fore one’s
desperate and lost condition, which one many have been totally unaware of” (Harding,
2000, p. 38). He directly invoked a sense of conviction, which “engenders a sense [that]
something must be done” (Harding, 2000, p. 38).
I am back because I see a nation of children, a couple of entire generations,
that have been brainwashed into believing the Second Amendment is criminal
in origin, rather than framed within the Constitution (Heston, 1997, p. 32).
So now we must move. Understand up front that there is no room in the
middle. You must either stand aside or step forward with us in this
partnership to save the Second Amendment (Heston, 1997, p. 34)
His call to gun owners to fight for the Second Amendment echoes the structure of
moralizing religious sermons (Luckmann, 2003), drawing on prophetic biblical metaphors
deeply embedded in American culture, such as the view that the Constitution serves as a
new covenant with God (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2018; Gorski, 2017b; Melzer, 2012). Moralizing
sermons tend to have three main parts: “the description of the present evil, a prophecy of
doom, followed by a call for repentance” (Luckmann, 2003, p. 197). In Heston’s depictions,
the “present evil” is the threat to the Second Amendment, which “is America’s First
Freedom, the one right that protects all others…The right to keep and bear arms is the one
right that allows ‘rights’ to exist at all’” (Heston, 1997, p. 32). By invoking memories of how
“Americans waded up those blood-red beaches at Okinawa and fought in the muddy fields
of Vietnam for more than mere words” (Heston, 1997, p. 32), Heston implied that without
the willingness of men with guns, the Second Amendment would become nothing more
than “polite platitudes of public discourse” (Heston, 1997, p. 32).
The prophecy of doom follows. Americans will be “herded, humbled and ruled” and
will sacrifice the rest of their rights without the “right to keep and bear arms [as] the one
right that allows ‘rights’ to exist at all” (Heston, 1997, p. 32). Heston stated, “it would be a
sin against everything this nation stands for to let the cornerstone of our Constitution
erode away out of simple neglect” (Heston, 1997, p. 34), explicitly tying religious failing of
sin to the political realm of the Constitution.
The call for repentance references a frequent biblical metaphor of the mountain as
well as a regathering of the faithful (Harding, 2000): “I’m urging our NRA membership to
reunite and rededicate itself to a monumental struggle – the tallest mountain we will ever
climb” (Heston, 1997, p. 33). Not only does his reference to a mountain invoke his own role
as Moses and the receiving of the Ten Commandments, but it also draws on the civil
religious rhetoric of Martin Luther King Jr. and his well-known Mountaintop speech.
Mountains figure prominently in both the Old and New Testaments as sacred places where

individuals such as Moses and Jesus spoke with God (Harding, 2000). Additionally, Heston’s
call to repentance explicitly implored NRA members to act decisively: “there is no room in
the middle. You must either stand aside or step forward with us.” He argued that failure to
act would mean watching “an entire generation of American youth drift off course into
disaster, while the freedoms they would have cherished…erode away” (Heston, 1997, p.
34). He invoked the implicit language of rights by asking members “will you march with
me?,” implicitly linking the Second Amendment to the Civil Rights movement (Gorski,
2017b; Harding, 2000).
Heston’s speech at the NRA annual meeting following the Columbine massacre
followed a similar prophetic structure by opening with a statement of the present misery.
The prophecy of doom continues, predicting the fracturing of the country if its enemies are
successful in pitting Americans against one another.

That is its singular sacred beauty and why we preserve it so fiercely. It is not
a right without rational restriction and it’s not for everyone. Only the lawabiding majority of society deserves the Second Amendment. Abuse it once
and lose it forever. That’s the law. But remarkably, the NRA is far more eager
to prosecute gun abusers than are those who oppose gun ownership
altogether...as if the tool could be more evil than the evildoer (Heston 1999, 14,
emphasis added)

I see our country teetering on the edge of an abyss. At its bottom brews the
simmering bile of deep, dark hatred. Hatred that’s dividing our country
politically, racially, economically, geographically, in every way.
This harvest of hatred is then sold as news, as entertainment, as government
policy. Such hateful, divisive forces are leading us to one awful end:
America’s own form of Balkanization. A weakened country of rabid factions,
each less free, and united only by hatred of one another. (Heston 1999, 13
emphasis added)
I am asking all of us, on both sides, to take one step back from the edge of
that cliff. Then another step and another, however many it takes to get back
to that place where we’re all Americans again...different, imperfect, diverse,
but one nation...indivisible. This cycle of tragedy-driven hatred must stop.
Because so much more connects us than divides us. And because tragedy has
been and will always be with us. Somewhere right now, evil people are
scheming evil things. All of us will do every meaningful thing we can to
prevent it. But each horrible act can’t become an axe for opportunists to
cleave the very Bill of Rights that binds us.
…[Y]ou’d better give them that eternal bodyguard called the Second
Amendment. The individual right to bear arms is freedom’s insurance policy,
not just for your children but for infinite generations to come...

Heston served as a witness for NRA members, linking faith in God to action needed
to defend the Second Amendment. His use of moralizing sermons focused on mobilizing the
NRA membership for “averting the threat” and avoiding continuing in the “present
misery…understood as sin” (Luckmann, 2003, p. 391). Moralizing sermons “served the
construction and maintenance of moral order for many centuries in Western society” and
are a “time-honored form of direct moralizing” (Luckmann, 2003, p. 401). Heston merged
the political with the religious, referring to the individual right to bear arms as something
sacred—that is, set apart from the profane everyday life and infused with its own
referential power (Durkheim, 1912). In his call for a crusade, Heston did not, however,
directly identify the source of the threat, leaving the evil implied, and therefore more
frightening, to serve as a source of motivation for action (O’Neill, 2007).
Evil Among Us
The NRA’s use of “terror-filled narrative” provides a central theme linking the defeat
of evil to the actions taken by NRA members (O’Neill, 2007, p. 459). Evil occupies an
interesting place in American religion and society, despite the secular turn. As the sacred
slipped free of churches (Demerath, 2003), so too did the understanding of evil and the
rituals used to control it. Sociological explorations of evil have been limited, treating evil
frequently as a social problem to be solved rather than as a consequence of cultural
understandings (Alexander, 2001). After the Columbine massacre and the events of 9/11,
the media played a strong role in reshaping Americans’ understanding of evil in everyday
life. The NRA was not alone in defining Columbine using a “discourse of fear” (Altheide,
2009, p. 1365). School shootings and terrorism made evil more real for everyday
Americans and also less controllable. Evil is not objective, however; rather, the perception
of evil comes from an “interpretation of events and their presumed causes” (Turk, 2004, p.
271). That said, all major world religions “permit, and may even require, violence in the
defense of the faith” and suggest that “[c]reatures of cosmic evil…are to be annihilated”
(Turk, 2004, p. 277).
Evil, especially in these uncertain times of significant social change (Bonikowski,
2016) marks the world as uncertain—a place where “attackers challenge the trust in the
assumed order” (Altheide, 2009, p. 1361). Being confronted with evil forces people to face
the stark reality of their own vulnerability (Neiman, 2015). and religion and ritual have
served every human society’s need to control uncertainty and evil (Durkheim, 1912;
Russell, 1987). Religion, however, also competes with the state as a means of organizing
and controlling violence (Friedland, 2001), and America’s own violent founding extends
from the merging of religion and political will (Dunbar, 1998; Juster, 2018; Obert, 2018).
The NRA’s gradual embrace of religious nationalism suggests a worldview in which its
preservation of the right to enact violence “declares the absence of state guarantee,”
fundamentally rejecting the notion that the state provides any control over violence
(Friedland, 2001, p. 129). The NRA advocated protection of the individual means to engage
in violence as a means of “restoring the moral order” (Turk, 2004, p. 277)
Evil serves as a mechanism to understand direct discussions of religious language in
the American Rifleman. References to evil over time in the American Rifleman illustrates the
merging of American civic religion with the New Christian Right’s rhetoric. I coded for main
references to evil: 1) evil as an unseen or disembodied force, 2) evil used to describe the

NRA, guns or hunting by anti-gun advocates, 3) evil men or criminals, and 4) evil laws or
government.

Figure 3. References to Evil in the American Rifleman from 1975 to 2018
Figure 3 shows that references to evil appear more frequently after the takeover of
hardline Second Amendment absolutists in 1977 but increased significantly following the
Columbine massacre and the events of 9/11 in the early 2000s. Additionally, what was
referred to as evil also changed over time, shifting from describing guns as evil in an effort
to caricature gun rights opponents’ arguments to referring to a more disembodied evil. One
of the earliest uses of describing laws as evil comes from Neal Knox in 1979 where he
described laws that would deprive individuals of their rights as evil. The implication is that
anyone who would deprive a law-abiding citizen of this fundamental human right is not
merely expressing an opposing political view but is also promoting an evil agenda meant to
undermine American sovereignty (Barker and Bearce, 2013).
The past decade has brought us one fundamental truth. Evil man with evil
intent will inflict all manner of abuse on a segment of the public and the color
of an evil law and a 1968 Gun Control Act is an evil law. (Knox, 1979).
This early use of “evil,” however, laid the foundation for later such uses to describe
criminals after LaPierre was elected as the Executive Vice President in 1991. No longer
were criminals other citizens subject to the rule of law; they were creatures to be violently
removed. The institutions could no longer be trusted to uphold the moral order, so it was
left to the armed, law-abiding citizen to cleanse the streets of evil.
If my actions have spared only one family from the distress and trauma that
this habitual criminal has caused hundreds of others, then I have served my

civic duty and taken one evil creature off of our streets, something that our
impotent criminal justice system had failed to do, despite some thirty odd
arrests, plea bargains and suspended sentences. (LaPierre 2008, 12 emphasis
added)
The notion of engaging in one’s civic duty to remove an evil monster represents the
merging of civic and religious obligations. This right to self-defense draws on the deeply
embedded American right to life, which is encoded in the Declaration of Independence but
goes even further:
This right to self-defense was not invented by the American founders
but has roots that are older than civilization itself. It is inscribed on
every human heart. It is a sacred responsibility - a choice that most
mainstream Americans understand. (LaPierre, 2008, p. 12)
References to evil in the American Rifleman exploded at the same time as the
concealed carry movement around 2008, likely due to both Obama’s election and the
massive economic recession (Stroud 2016). Critically, the merging of the religion based
reference to “evil” with the language of civic duty demonstrates the how the framing
around the Second Amendment has changed over time.
Heston led the NRA through its first defiant turn following the Columbine shooting.
The NRA emerged as combative and uncompromising following the massacre by refusing
to move its annual conference from Denver (Cullen, 2010).
The majesty of the Second Amendment that our founders so divinely
captured and crafted into your birthright, guarantees that no government
desperate, no renegade faction of armed forces, no roving gangs of criminals,
no breakdown of law and order, no massive anarchy, no force of evil or crime
or oppression from within or from without can ever rob you of the liberties
that define your Americanism. (Heston, 1999, p. 14)
This approach marked a change in the NRA’s response to school shootings over the
next two decades, which was marked by a merging a defiant, “more guns” stance and
Second Amendment absolutism (Hodges, 2015) with a religious obligation to “restore the
moral order” (Turk, 2004, p. 277). This rhetorical notion of evil mirrors Falwell’s tendency
to paint political opponents as agents of Satan, focusing not on political victories that would
enable compromise but on total dehumanization of America’s enemies Clarke 2002; Oliver
and Wood 2014; Goertzel 1994; Hodges 2015).
Columbine marked a deepening of the shift in references to evil, further linking the
absence of the rule of law to the subsequent failure of the government. Defining the mass
shooters as evil builds on born-again Christians’ belief that the Devil is literal and real
(Harding, 2000) but also requires violent defensive actions rather than a reliance on the
law to restrain the lawless. This justification would be used successfully again and again
following mass shootings over the two decades following Columbine: laws would not stop
someone bent on harming the innocent (Demons at our Door, 2015; LaPierre, 2012). The
description of the Columbine shooters as “twisted terrorists” and “a stone-hearted death

squad” invokes imagery of irrational actors—monsters hiding in “plain” sight as “kids”
demonstrates the need to always be on guard.
The school terrorists were America’s children – just plain “kids” – and that
somehow the guns they used made them do it. But the Littleton, Colorado
murderers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were not America’s children. They
were a stone hearted giggling death squad who openly planned the murders
for a year – who even made school sponsored video acting out their horrific
crimes. Nobody in authority paid attention....Long before they celebrated
Hitler’s birthday by killing innocent schoolmates, these twisted terrorists
could’ve been intercepted and stopped if only if someone in authority had
paid attention. (LaPierre 1997, p. 10, emphasis added)
The Second Amendment, then, offers power to the “common man” to protect himself
and his family from extraordinary evil, and this “sacred stuff” comes directly from the
divine (Heston, 2000b). Associating shootings such as those at Columbine, Aurora, or Sandy
Hook with depraved monsters who cannot be stopped by the rule of law (Demons at our
Door, 2015), the NRA argues that the only logical step is to take up arms to protect home
and kin and that relinquishing guns in the face of evil means surrendering to it. The NRA
describes a dangerous world where freedoms are under attack not by others with whom
we disagree but by “demons among us” (Demons at our Door, 2015).

You and I didn’t choose to be targets in the age of terror. But innocents like
us will continue to be slaughtered in concert halls, sports stadiums,
restaurants and airplanes. No amount of bloodshed will ever satisfy the
demons among us. These cowards dream of inflicting more damage, more
suffering, more terror. No target is too intimate or too sacred for these
monsters. They will come to where we worship, to where we educate, to
where we live. But when evil knocks on our doors, Americans have a power no
other people on the planet share—the full-throated right to defend our families
and ourselves with our Second Amendment. Let fate decide if mercy is offered
to the demons at our door. I’m the National Rifle Association of America and
I’m freedom’s safest place. (Demons at Our Door, 2015, emphasis added)

Critically, these so-called demons are not law-abiding citizens. They are criminals,
gangsters and thugs—monsters who cannot be constrained by the law. Guns serve as a
mechanism not only to define the individual as a hero (Carlson, 2015; O’Neill, 2007; Stroud,
2016) but also to define reality around the idea that the individual is inherently dangerous
and untrustworthy, building on Protestant beliefs about the sinful nature of the mankind
and the fallen nature of the world (Harding, 2000). Ads run by the NRA support this
rhetoric, providing a dark and ominous worldview that requires “us” to protect ourselves
from “them.” The Second Amendment offers protection from these manifestations of the
evil. In this worldview, the only thing protecting the law-abiding citizen gun owner from
tyrannical government overreach is the Second Amendment. A critical part of this
tyrannical overreach involves depriving the individual citizen of the right to self-defense. In
this definition of the situation (Heise, 1979; MacKinnon and Heise, 2010), there are clearly

evil people who should not have access to guns but do, making it an abdication of an
individual’s moral duty not to be armed and prepared to defend against it. By this logic, it is
completely rational to want to take action to defend against the dangerous monsters, who,
by their very nature, generally conceal their intentions until they strike (Collins, 2014).
The Merging of the Second Amendment With Religious Nationalism
Christian nationalism has a long history in the United States (Bowman, 2018; Gorski,
2017b; Juster, 2018), and the NRA has successfully used Christian nationalist rhetoric to
turn “politics into religious obligation” (Friedland, 2001, p. 126). The conflict between the
state and religion is centrally the problem of authority. Despite being ostensibly a political
lobbying group, the NRA has yoked its model of authority to the divine, rejecting the idea
that the secular government can claim authority over what God has granted. In doing so,
the NRA has elevated the defense of the Second Amendment to the role of religious
obligation in the political sphere. As the United States turned toward secular governance,
Christian nationalism was reborn, and the NRA embraced these rhetorical devices to
further its own messaging.
The NRA adopted two critical frames that helped align the Second Amendment with
the New Christian Right’s religious nationalism: distrust in the government and rugged
individualism (Obert, 2018; Yamane, 2017b; Yamane et al., 2018). First, distrust in
government has deep roots in American history. A significant and influential stream in
Protestant thought involves the “strongly anti-political and anti-civic side. The state and
larger society are unnecessary because the saved take care of themselves” (Bellah et al.,
2007, p. xvi). Second, rugged individualism involves paranoia and fear of the state inherited
from the founding of the nation. Jeffersonian and Madisonian republicanism “viewed with
hostility not only cities, but also taxation and virtually any function for the state. A paranoid
fear of the state is not something new but can be seen from the earliest days of the
republic” (Bellah et al., 2007, p. xvi). Both of these frames built on the idea of the rights of
individuals to be free from the government’s influence in their daily lives (Bowman, 2018;
MacLean, 2018).
Under the leadership of hardliners such as Harlan Carter and Neal Knox, the NRA
began to transition to a more absolutist stance regarding the Second Amendment in the
late 1970s. With the rising political influence of the New Christian Right, the NRA
leadership began to use more religiously coded language to elevate the Second Amendment
above the restrictions of a secular government, building on New Christian Right rhetoric
about the role of God in the U.S. Constitution. The New Christian Right built on deeply
American views that the Constitution was divinely inspired: “institutional truths about the
proper form of government” and could not be altered (Gorski, 2017b, p. 181).
The NRA’s use of religious nationalism also served as means of retaining
“membership in the political community” (Friedland, 2001, p. 130) at a time when
Christian feelings of persecution by the state continued to grow (Bowman, 2018; Harding,
2000; Hedges, 2008; Woodberry and Smith, 1998; Wuthnow, 1990). Significant Supreme
Court decisions that limited the rights of Christians to pray in public schools (Bowman,
2018) along with the New Christian Right’s fear of moral decline prompted them to push
back against the power of the state by deliberately seeking to control it (Harding, 2000;
Wuthnow, 1990). In Weberian terms, the New Christian Right embraced a legal rational

authority, no longer content to wait for a charismatic authority to turn America back to the
Lord, (Weber, 1973). Conversely, the NRA sought to elevate the Second Amendment
through the use of charismatic authority while also seeking to carve protected sacred space
for it in the legal sphere.
Harlon Carter may have been “seen as Moses, George Washington and John Wayne”
(Melzer, 2012, p. 38) after the 1977 Revolt at Cincinnati, which was the dawn of the NRA’s
hardline stance toward the Second Amendment. Carter directed the political turn of the
NRA toward a hardline stance (Knox, 2009). LaPierre built the NRA as an institution
anchored in nationalism, referred to as the “rock of the NRA” (Melzer, 2012, p. 13), a not
unsubtle reference to Peter, one of Jesus disciples and founder of the Christian church.
Following Carter, however, the spirit of Moses was more explicitly embodied—both
literally and symbolically—in Charlton Heston, who arrived to shepherd the NRA faithful
across the religious and temporal boundaries of the new millennium and merged the
obligation with civic duty (Melzer, 2012).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the NRA’s use of religious nationalist discourse to elevate
the Second Amendment beyond the reach of the state. Drawing on the New Christian
Right’s belief in moral decay, distrust of the government, and belief in evil and the end
times, along with the “paranoid style of American politics” (Hodges, 2015; Hofstadter,
1970), the NRA used shared metaphors to link the Second Amendment to religious
nationalism, moving clearly toward Second Amendment absolutism. The linking of
religious language with civic duty builds on a long history of religious nationalism in
American history (Bellah, 1992; Gorski, 2017b; Yamane, 1998). The NRA may have invoked
religious framing because their membership would likely be more receptive to the frames
of religiously motivated, politically active people of faith (Lakoff, 2004). More research is
needed to explain whether this language resonated (McDonald et al., 2017) with individual
members of the NRA and, more broadly, beyond the bounds of the gun owning community.
Critically, this research does not argue that all NRA members are religious
nationalists nor that all religious nationalists are NRA members or even gun owners. There
is significant overlap in those populations, however (Hovey et al., 2017; Yamane, 2017b;
Yamane et al., 2018), and future research should investigate where those boundaries are
permeable or impenetrable. Additionally, this paper focuses on the discursive overlap
between the NRA and the New Christian Right, but more research is needed to establish
how this overlap occurred and where the boundaries lie. Although recent research has
shown a negative association between religiosity and gun ownership, this study shows how
the NRA has borrowed from religious language to create “alternative symbols and
identities” that potentially create a hybrid identity that is more religious nationalist than
purely religious or civic minded (Mencken and Froese, 2017, p. 21).
This paper does not make a causal connection between NRA rhetoric and member
beliefs. Future research should investigate to understand the ways in which gun ownership
and religious nationalism overlap with or diverge from traditional Protestant beliefs and
practices (Whitehead et al., 2018). Future research should also investigate how individuals
gun owners engage with the Second Amendment both as a focal point of religious
nationalism and as a civic and religious identity (Mencken and Froese, 2017). Additional

research is needed to investigate the ways in which religious nationalism is present or
missing in broader gun culture (Burbick, 2006; Yamane, 2017b) as well at the ways this
language is adopted or discarded by diverse groups, such as women and racial or religious
minorities.
This paper offers a potential mechanism for explaining how the NRA molded “Gun
Crusader’s deep commitment to gun rights…[as well as] to the NRA’s current and future
ability to remain a potent political force” (Melzer, 2012, p. 254). I demonstrate that the NRA
cultivated commitment to the Second Amendment as a deep-seated piece of religious
nationalism that offers “ a cultural solidarity and commitment [rooted in] identity,
morality, and patriotism [of] gun ownership” (Mencken and Froese, 2017, p. 22). Over the
last 40 years, the NRA has deliberately pivoted to protecting the Second Amendment, not as
something merely important but as something sacred to be defended at all costs from the
profane hands of the government. The NRA has done this by deliberately using religious
imagery, language, and icons such as Charlton Heston, that map onto the largely Protestant
religious beliefs and religious nationalism tracing back to the founding of the nation. The
present analysis suggests that the Second Amendment may offer a sense of meaningmaking that allows men to feel like protectors of their families and their homes against an
evil that cannot be contained by the rule of law. In this sense, the arming of the average
law-abiding citizen is a completely rational response to the increasingly random threat that
is deeply felt in parts of American society. These threats do not need to be real in order to
have real consequences (Merton, 1995, 1968).
