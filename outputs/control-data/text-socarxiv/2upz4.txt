Aspect Ratios of Historical Societies and Their Relation To Climate
Christopher Wolfram
Abstract
Jared Diamond proposed that societies grow in accordance with regional differences in climate, and that because climate varies more drastically when moving north-south than when
moving east-west, large societies will grow faster east-west than north-south. We characterize
aspect ratio for regions on the globe and find that societies are on average wider than they
are tall, supporting Diamond’s claim. However, we find a similar effect with small and large
societies, suggesting another underlying cause. We then investigate the first part of Diamond’s
claim, finding that societies do not grow in accordance with climate in the manner he predicts.

Introduction

In his book, Guns, Germs, and Steel [1], Jared Diamond proposes that the axes of continents
had, and perhaps still have, an influence on the spread of agriculture and indirectly on the spread
of technology, ideas, and societies. Diamond argues that domesticated crops and livestock will
often be best suited for the climate in which they were domesticated, guiding the spread of these
domesticates into other regions of similar climate and away from regions with significantly different
climates. He then proposes that because climate generally changes more drastically with latitude
than it does with longitude, these domesticates will generally spread more easily east-west than
they will north-south. The constraints of agriculture, he says, can then influence the spread of
technology and the growth of empires.
Though data regarding the spread of agriculture and technology is scarce, much more data
exists on the spread of societies. Mathematica provides information on the borders of about a
thousand historical and modern societies. Most of this data was originally collected as part of
the GeaCron Project (http://www.geacron.com). This data likely contains many small errors.
However, we only care about the general shape of each society, and so these small errors should
not be significant for us. In addition, it is unlikely that these errors have any particular directional
bias, and so given the amount of data, the errors should roughly cancel themselves out.
Some work has already been done on Diamond’s second claim that societies bias toward eastwest growth, but it has either been done with small sample sizes or without fully systematic methods
for characterizing the growth of the sampled societies [2, 3]. In addition, little work has been done
on Diamond’s first claim that societies grow so as to minimize the diversity of climates within their
borders. Both of these will be investigated here, starting with the question of whether societies
bias toward east-west growth.

2.1

The East-West Bias of Societies
Characterizing Aspect Ratio

We can restate Diamond’s claim in terms of aspect ratios. Diamond argues that societies on average
will be wider than they are tall, meaning that they will have an aspect ratio greater than 1. In
1

order to test this claim, we need a way of measuring the aspect ratios of every society for which we
have data.
2.1.1

Bounding Regions

There are a few intuitive characterizations of aspect ratio that we can start with. We might
imagine drawing the society in question on a map, measuring its width and height, and dividing
appropriately. However, that description ignores the important step of projecting the society from
the globe onto a map using some map projection. This method, and a number of similar methods,
is projection dependent, meaning that it will give us a different answer depending on the projection
we choose. In fact, in extreme cases we can get opposite results by choosing different projections
(Figure 1). Because map projections skew the data to give us virtually any aspect ratio, we cannot
rely on any map projection to characterize the aspect ratio of a region on the globe. Instead, we
need some projection-independent characterization.
Mercator

Lambert cylindrical projection

Figure 1: The Tsardom of Russia in 1548 using the Mercator projection (left), and a Lambert
cylindrical projection (right). The black regions show the borders of the Tsardom of Russia while
the red regions show the bounding rectangles in each projection. We can see that even though the
black regions represent the same region on the globe, they have significantly different aspect ratios
after being projected. In fact, the aspect ratio of the Mercator projected region is about 1:2, while
the aspect ratio of the Lambert cylindrical projected region is about 2:1.

2.1.2

Bounding Coordinates

Perhaps the simplest projection-independent characterization of aspect ratio is based on bounding
latitudes and longitudes. For some region on the globe, we can measure its height and width by
calculating the difference between its minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes. However,
we cannot directly compare the difference in minimum and maximum latitudes to the corresponding
difference in longitudes because degrees latitude and degrees longitude are not compatible units.
While 1◦ latitude represents roughly the same distance everywhere on the globe (just over 110 km),
1◦ longitude represents different distances depending on the latitude (ranging from 0 km at the
poles to about 110 km at the equator).
To make our measurements of height and width compatible, we would need to convert the
degrees latitude and longitude into units of distance. Figure 2 shows one method for doing this.
Because degrees latitude convert to units of distance relatively consistently, it is not hard to convert
2

the bounding latitudes into a measure of height. In order to measure width, we choose two points
at the correct longitudes and at some characteristic latitude (generally the mean of the minimum
and maximum latitudes) and measure the distance between them along lines of constant latitude.

Figure 2: The left shows the bounding coordinates of the Roman Republic in the year 129 BCE.
The right shows the bounding coordinates of the modern United States. The red-tinted regions
show the bounding latitudes and longitudes. The length of the blue lines is taken as the measure
of height and the length of the red lines is taken as the measure of width.
There are two problems with this method. First, our choice of latitude when measuring the
width can give us systematically skewed results. Here, we arbitrarily chose the mean latitude,
but if instead we chose the minimum or maximum latitude we could systematically measure each
society as being wider or narrower than we would otherwise. Second, because this method is based
on bounding coordinates, it is extremely sensitive to outliers, as has been noted before [2]. To
illustrate this, Figure 2 shows the bounding coordinates of the modern United States. The 48
contiguous states have no effect on this bounding region because the extreme points of the United
States lie in the US Virgin Islands (in the east), Guam (in the west), Alaska (in the north), and
American Samoa (in the south). As a result, the bounding coordinates of the United States mostly
contain the Pacific Ocean, and do not represent the shape of the majority of the country.
We need a characterization of aspect ratio that is not only projection independent, but also
insensitive to outliers.
2.1.3

Moments of Inertia

We can measure the width and height of each society by measuring its moment of inertia around
certain axes in 3D. That is, for some society, we start by taking its unprojected shape in 3D
(following the curvature of the Earth). We can then measure its width by calculating its moment
of inertia around a vector pointing north or south and its height by calculating its moment of inertia
around a vector pointing east or west (see Figure 3). Let vc be the vector from the center of the
Earth to the society’s center of mass, and let vp be the vector from the center of the Earth to the
North Pole. We can calculate the vector vw that points west from the society’s center of mass by
evaluating vw = vc × vp , and we can calculate the vector vs that points south from the society’s
center of mass by evaluating vs = vc × vw . The society’s moment of inertia around vs will be our
measure of width and its moment of inertia around vw will be our measure of its height.
Now that we have a measure of width and height, we can define the aspect ratio as the width
divided by the height. In many visualizations and calculations, we will look at the log of the aspect
ratio. We take the log so that defining the aspect ratio as the height over the width instead of the
width over the height is reduced to a difference in sign. We will often average using the geometric

mean of the aspect ratios because it is equal to the exponential of the arithmetic mean of the log
of the aspect ratios.

2.2

Results

We can now calculate the aspect ratio of each border shape in our dataset. We should note that
Mathematica often provides border shapes at multiple points in time for a single society, but for
much of our analysis we will only consider each society at its largest extent. Otherwise we would
give societies for which we have more detailed data more weight than societies for which we have
less detailed data. For example, Mathematica provides 63 border shapes for the Roman Empire
but only 1 for Albania, but we do not want to give the Roman Empire 63 times more weight than
Albania.
We can calculate that the geometric mean of the aspect ratios is about 1.11. Because the
geometric mean is greater than 1 (p ≈ 10−5 ), we can see that societies are on average wider than
they are tall, supporting Diamond’s claim.

Figure 4: Aspect ratio of societies as a function of area. Aspect ratio is shown on a log scale. Each
blue point represents a society at its largest extent. The horizontal red line marks an aspect ratio
of 1. Societies that are wide appear above the line, while those that are tall appear below it. The
orange curve shows the moving geometric mean with span 500 000 km2 . The plot on the right has
a smaller domain on the x-axis and uses a moving average with span 100 000 km2 .
Diamond’s argument is only supposed to apply to very large societies, so larger societies should
exhibit a larger effect. Figure 4 shows the aspect ratio of each society as a function of its area.
4

We can see that many relatively small societies seem to exhibit very little effect, while larger ones
exhibit a small and unreliable effect. The lack of a reliable upward slope and the lack of a large
difference in effect size between small and large societies suggest that there could be other, less
area-dependent factors that drive societies to grow horizontally.

Figure 5: Each disk is placed approximately at the center of each society, and its color represents
its aspect ratio. Red disks represent wide societies while blue disks represent tall ones. White disks
are neither wide nor tall.
In order to understand why societies have the aspect ratios that they do, it would help to see
not just how area affects aspect ratio, but also geography. Figure 5 shows how aspect ratios are
distributed across the globe. The orientation of nearby coasts appears to have a large effect on the
society’s aspect ratio. For example, societies in Asia Minor are mostly wide, reflecting the horizontal
coasts, while societies in northern Italy and southern India are taller, reflecting the vertical coasts.
It is possible that we have more data in regions with horizontal coasts, creating a selection bias for
more horizontal societies.
At this point, we can see that the societies about which we have data are generally wide, which
seems to validate Diamond’s claim. However, it is harder to see if there are other, larger effects
(such as the orientation of coastlines) that might overshadow the climatological effect that Diamond
proposes.

Societal Growth and Climate

Now that we have investigated Diamond’s claim about the aspect ratios of societies, we should
turn to investigate his underlying claim about the effect of climate on societal growth. Diamond
argued that societies grow more easily into regions with a similar climate to their own, implying
that societies should have relatively uniform climates. Therefore, we will begin by characterizing
climate diversity.

5

3.1

Characterizing Climate Diversity

There are a number of different variables that we could use in characterizing climate. In his
discussion of societal growth, Diamond focuses on temperature, rainfall, and vegetation. Here, we
will also consider temperature and rainfall, and we will use primary productivity as a basic measure
of the amount of vegetation [4].
Because we do not have high-resolution historical climate data, we are restricted to using modern
data. Though the modern climate may not perfectly reflect the historical climate, we will generally
look at the variance, and so uniform shifts toward more or less rain, or higher or lower temperatures,
should not affect our analysis of climate diversity.
We can start by taking monthly temperature, primary productivity, and rainfall data from
NASA NEO (https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov). We can combine the monthly data at each point
into 12-dimensional vectors representing each climate variable over the 12 months of the year.
In order to calculate the temperature diversity of a given region on the Earth, we will collect
all the 12-dimensional vectors that lie within that region, concatenate them into a single large list,
and then calculate standard deviation of all the elements of that list. Essentially, we calculate
the standard deviation of all temperatures that appear within the region at any time of year. For
example, Figure 6 shows an approximation of the distribution of temperatures that now appear in
the region that the Roman Republic covered in 129 BCE. The standard deviation of this distribution
is what we use as the temperature diversity of Rome in 129 BCE.

temperature (°C)

distribution of temperatures in the
region of the Roman Republic in
the year 129 BCE. NEO clips high
and low temperatures, creating the
spike on the right edge.

We can calculate the primary productivity diversity using the same method as for temperature.
Rainfall, however, requires a slightly altered definition. Diamond emphasizes that the amount of
rain does not matter as much as when in the year it falls. In particular, he argues that certain
crops that were bred for summer rains can have difficulties growing in regions where there are
winter rains, and vice versa. To capture this, we can calculate the standard deviation of rainfall
levels in each month, leaving us with a 12-dimensional vector representing the monthly rainfall
diversity. If one part of a society sees summer rains, while another sees winter rains, then the
standard deviations representing summer and winter months will be high, because in one month
the society will see both high and low amounts of rain in different regions. In order to characterize
the overall rainfall diversity, we can then sum the elements of this vector.

3.2

Comparisons

We now have a measure of climate diversity, but this measure is different for each society. That is,
with our current measure, we cannot compare the climate diversity of separate societies because
some societies might be more or less diverse by virtue of their location or land area. For example,
6

we would expect Russia to have a more diverse climate than Switzerland simply because it is much
larger.
In order to assess whether a society grew so as to have a uniform climate, we can compare its
climate to an approximation of the climate diversity that it gets from its land area and location.
For each society, consider a disk with the same land area and centered on the same point (Figure
7). If the society had grown so as to have a uniform climate, we would expect its climate to be
more uniform than that of its associated disk.
Figure 7: The red-tinted region
shows the borders of the Roman
Republic in the year 129 BCE. The
blue-tinted region is generated by
taking a disk and removing oceans.
The disk is selected so that the
blue-tinted region has the same
land area as the red-tinted region,
and is centered on the same point.
It is important to note that we want these disks to have the same land area as their associated
societies, and so significant bodies of water should be removed. We can use numerical minimization
to find disk radii that make land area within the disks are equal to the land area of their associated
societies.
We can divide the climate diversity of a society’s disk by the climate diversity of the society
itself to get a measure of relative climate uniformity. This gives us a ratio that we can handle in a
similar way to the aspect ratios from the previous section.

3.3

Results

Because we defined relative climate uniformity in terms of climate diversity, and we have three types
of climate diversity (temperature, primary productivity, and rainfall), we will have three types of
climate uniformity. Table 1 shows the geometric mean and standard deviation of relative climate
uniformity across all societies. The fact that the geometric means are less than 1 tells us that the
disks had slightly more uniform climates than their associated societies, going against Diamond’s
argument.

Table 1: Statistics of relative uniformities for all societies considered.
The fact that the standard deviations are so low tells us that individual disks performed very
similarly to their associated societies. This might suggest that our definition of climate diversity
always returns results in a small range. However, by looking at the distribution of temperature
diversity across all societies (Figure 8), we see that our definition gives a wide range of values,
suggesting that the similarities between the disks and their societies are not simply a product of
how we defined climate diversity.

Finally, just as with aspect ratios, Diamond’s argument applies primarily to geographically
large societies. However, Figure 9 shows that relative climate uniformity does not increase with
land area, as Diamond’s theory would suggest.

Conclusion

Diamond makes two major claims: that societies are on average wider than they are tall, and that
societies grow faster into regions with similar climates to their own.
To test the first claim, we started by characterizing aspect ratio. There is no single definition
of aspect ratio on a globe, but we developed a moment of inertia based method that is projection
independent and insensitive to outliers. With this method, we found that societies are on average
wider than they are tall, agreeing with Diamond’s claim. However, by Diamond’s argument, we

8

would expect larger societies to exhibit a larger effect, but this is not the case, suggesting another
cause. We hypothesize that the orientation of coastlines might be a bigger effect, overshadowing
the effects of climate.
In order to test Diamond’s second claim, we used modern satellite climate data on temperature,
primary productivity, and rainfall to characterize climate diversity. We created a measure of relative
climate uniformity by comparing the climate diversity of each society to a disk of equal land area.
We found that, on average, societies have extremely similar climate diversities to their associated
disks and the effect is no larger with societies with higher land area, going against Diamond’s claim.
