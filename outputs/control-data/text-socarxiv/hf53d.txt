Sharing or Limiting the Wealth? Coresidence, Parental Support, and Wealth Outcomes in
Canada

Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between coresidence with adult children, wealth, and
economic security using data from the 1999-2012 Canadian Survey of Financial Security (SFS).
The results, obtained via propensity score matching and linear regression, show that coresidence
with and parental support for adult children is negatively associated with non-home assets and
positively associated with debt levels among Canadian households. Further analyses suggest that
these relationships stem from differences in financial assets, retirement savings, student loan debt,
and credit card balances. By linking theories of economic insecurity, social capital, and life course
studies, this study demonstrates how changing trajectories among young adults and financial
hardship can influence broader household resources and stability.

Since the 1980s, rates of coresidence among young adults and their parents have risen
across industrialized countries, and especially within Canada, a trend that corresponds with
increased life expectancy for adults and a more elongated transition into adulthood for youth
(Seltzer and Bianchi 2013). During the same time, young adults, and households in general, have
experienced growing economic insecurity with declining safety nets, a tighter labor market, and
riskier employment prospects (Banting and Myles 2013; Fortin et al. 2012; Hacker 2006), which
has further increased the need for financial transfers within families. This can become especially
problematic for parents who continue to support their children into adulthood through coresidence
and other types of financial and non-financial transfers (Schoeni and Ross 2005). In such
situations, coresidence can function to stabilize resources and act as an investment for a child's
future (Bianchi et al. 2007; Swartz 2009), but it can also have destabilizing effects when parents
use limited resources to aid children at their own expense (Maroto 2017; Maroto and Aylsworth
2017).
How do changing trajectories for young adults influence parental resources and economic
wellbeing? Specifically, what is the relationship between coresidence with and support for adult
children and household wealth? To answer these questions, this study analyzed three waves of
data from the 1999-2012 Canadian Survey of Financial Security (SFS). First, propensity score
matching methods with nearest neighbor matching were used to create balanced samples for
families based on the presence of adult children in the household. This helped to reduce selection
bias and effect heterogeneity across households by creating treatment and control groups with
similar characteristics (Ho et al. 2007; Morgan and Winship 2007; Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983).
Doubly robust regression with the same covariates on the matched data was then applied to assess
the relationship between the presence of adult children and household non-home assets and debt,
two indicators of wealth and economic security that likely fluctuate with household dynamics. To

4
supplement these findings, the relationship with financial assets, savings, educational loans, and
credit card debt was also examined.
Previous research demonstrates that household structure is related to net worth where
two-adult households tend to hold more wealth than others (Lersch 2017; Lupton and Smith 2003;
Ozawa and Lee 2006; Zagorsky 2005) and extended household arrangements, most of which
contain adult children who receive some support from their parents (Choi 2003; Smits et al.
2010), are often associated with wealth declines (Maroto and Aylsworth 2017). Fewer studies,
however, have specifically addressed how continuing parental support for children through an
elongated transition into adulthood influences household assets and debt.
This research aims to fill the gap, while also considering the interconnectivity of assets,
debt, and financial situations across generations. The framework combines theories of economic
insecurity (Hacker et al. 2014; Western et al. 2012), social capital (Bourdieu 1986; Coleman
1988; Portes 1998), and the life course (Elder 1985; Elder et al. 2003) to demonstrate how
changing trajectories among young adults influence parental resources and stability. By directly
tying individual trajectories to the situations of family members, life course models acknowledge
how linked lives are embedded in webs of social obligations characterized by social capital.
Because trajectories of parents and children are linked, changes in transitions and economic
situations of children have consequences for parents. Although periods of coresidence often
improve the economic situations of young adults, support for adult children and continuing
coresidence can also strain household resources.
The findings show that coresidence acts as a destabilizing force for household economic
security through its negative association with assets and positive association with debt levels.
Even after accounting for the household's homeownership status and income, coresidence was
associated with an 18.2% decrease in non-home assets and a doubling of non-home debt.

5
Analyses of specific asset and debt variables then build on these results to demonstrate that asset
decreases primarily stemmed from financial asset declines, but debt increases were related to
educational and credit card debt. The combined asset and debt effects then influenced household
balance sheets by pulling total net worth in the negative direction among coresidential families.
Life course theories further acknowledge how individual trajectories are embedded within
and shaped by historical time and place, which requires a consideration of broader trends in
wealth inequality, economic insecurity, coresidence, and social policy. Although Canada has a
stronger welfare system when compared to countries like the United States, funding cuts to social
assistance programs and post-secondary education over the past few decades, combined with
risker job prospects and few policies that confront wealth disparities, have increased the burdens
placed on families (Banting and Myles 2013). To address this context, the paper begins with a
discussion of trends in wealth, economic insecurity, coresidence, and support for young adult
children in Canada.

Wealth and Economic Insecurity
Studies of economic insecurity expand on broader inequality research to consider the
effects of risks and shocks present in systems of stratification. In this framework, economic
insecurity refers to the "degree to which individuals experience and are protected against large
economic losses" (Hacker et al. 2014, p. S6) or the "risk of economic loss faced by workers and
households as they encounter the unpredictable events of social life" (Western et al. 2012, p. 342).
Economic insecurity further entails aspects of resource adequacy and asset sufficiency, factors
that affect a household's ability to weather different hardships and survive economic shocks
(Hacker et al. 2014). Resources come in many forms that range from government-provided social
safety nets to social networks to emergency savings funds and extended assets (Lusardi et al.

6
2011; Osberg and Sharpe 2014). Within this framework, wealth, which represents a household’s
larger stock of resources, becomes central to a family's economic security, especially when other
supports are limited (Keister and Moller 2000; Spilerman 2000).
Although wealth provides long-term benefits that include saving for retirement,
supplementing education, and supporting entrepreneurship, financial or liquid assets also act as a
buffer for economic shocks, allowing families to better manage short-term risks (Lusardi et al.
2011). In addition, despite the current declines in retirement savings that now put younger
Canadian cohorts at a higher risk of having inadequate retirement support (MacDonald et al.
2011; Messacar and Morissette 2015), pensions provide an important source of security later in
life. Due to their many benefits, assets, which include homes, vehicles, pensions, stocks, and
general savings, improve economic security and stability for households.
The relationship between debt, which includes mortgages, balances on credit cards,
vehicle debt, education debt, and other types of loans, and economic insecurity, however, is more
complicated. Access to credit presents another important economic buffer (Hacker et al. 2014),
but higher debt levels can be hard for families to balance, especially when faced with adverse
events (Maroto 2015; Sullivan et al. 2000). Thus, there are two wealth factors to consider as
measures of economic security -- assets and debt -- especially those types not connected to
homeownership, which is harder to access in times of financial hardship. These factors are tied to
economic conditions, as well as policy choices and institutional practices at the national and
provincial levels (Fortin et al. 2012; Banting and Myles 2013). They also hold implications for
household dynamics and changes in the transition to adulthood.

Support for and Coresidence with Adult Children in Canada
Parental support for and spending on young adult children has increased over time

7
(Kornrich and Furstenberg 2013), and parents tend to view their support as integral to children’s
later success (Settersten and Ray 2010). Coresidence with adult children, in particular, has
become more common since the 1980s with changing life course trajectories among young adults
(Bengtson 2001; Milan 2016; Ruggles 2007). In 2011, 59% of 20-24 year olds and 25% of 25-29
year olds lived with their parents in Canada (Statistics Canada 2016). Since 1981, this represents
increases of 43% among 20-24 year olds and 123% among 25-29 year olds. These trends mirror
previous U.S. studies, which indicated that that 57% of 20- to 22-year-olds and 25% of 23- to 27year-olds lived with their parents, and 40-50% of young adults returned home after their initial
departures (Aquilino 1996; Yelowitz 2007).
Increases in coresidence coincide with rising economic insecurity that is especially present
among young adults, who face lower wages, fewer available jobs, and higher rates of
unemployment when compared to earlier cohorts (Milan 2016; Wiemers 2014). In addition to
these labor market factors, young adults tend to have greater debt than previous generations,
particularly in the form of unsecured debt and student loans (Dwyer et al. 2011; Houle 2014).
Housing prices and affordability further influence rates of coresidence, where young adults are
less likely to live independently in more expensive areas that include Canada’s larger cities
(Milan 2016; Yelowitz 2007). As life course trajectories are embedded within time and place,
these broader trends factor into the oft cited elongated transition to adulthood.

Linked Lives and Life Course Trajectories
Most family demographers agree that the transition to adulthood has become longer and
more varied with increasing education, housing, and transportation costs since the 1970s and 80s
(Furstenberg 2010; Swartz 2008, 2009). In addition to changing trajectories for young adults, this
elongated transition also affects parents, particularly those who support their children into

8
adulthood (Kornrich and Furstenberg 2013). These relationships reflect the linked lives principle,
a key component of life course theory (Elder 1985). According to this principle, "lives are lived
interdependently and socio-historical influences are expressed through this network of shared
relationships" (Elder et al. 2003, p. 13). The strong intergenerational ties between parents and
children and the obligations embedded within their networks become especially relevant when
considering how parents support children (Furstenberg 2005).
Parental support comes in many forms that include material assistance through the transfer
of money, goods, and housing (Schoeni and Ross 2005; Seltzer and Bianchi 2013; Swartz 2009),
payment for schooling (Rauscher 2016), and childcare (Folbre 2012). The amount and type of
assistance provided also differs across families (Schoeni and Ross 2005). Parents with higher
incomes and education are more likely to provide financial transfers to children (Fingerman et al.
2015), but shared housing is more common among low-income and racial minority families
(Seltzer and Bianchi 2013). Even though support varies with the needs and circumstances of the
children (Fingerman et al. 2009; Smits et al. 2010), most youth receive some assistance
(Goldscheider et al. 2001; Yelowitz 2007) with one-third to one-half of adult youth living
independently reporting financial support from their parents (Schoeni and Ross 2005; Swartz et
al. 2011).
Overall, households and families are central to understanding aspects of wealth and
economic insecurity, which depend on social context, intra-household relationships, and
individual circumstances (Macmillan and Copher 2005). Although many studies have used this
framework to assess how parental situations affect children, fewer have studied how financial
hardship and economic insecurity among children might influence parental wellbeing (Kalmijn
and De Graff 2012). Nevertheless, changes in household structure, such as the decision to double
up with kin, can have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on family resources (Cancian and

9
Haskins 2014; Maroto and Aylsworth 2017; McLanahan and Percheski 2008). With increasing
rates of coresidence, rising debt levels, and growing economic insecurity among youth, this raises
the question of what effects might coresidence have on household wealth?

Stabilizing and Destabilizing Effects of Coresidence
Two perspectives regarding the potential effects of coresidence on assets and debt emerge
from the literature. First, coresidence could benefit household wealth through the sharing of
resources and provision of economies of scale. By pooling resources, coresidence offers certain
benefits, especially for more vulnerable groups that include single parents, young adults, and
racial minorities (Glick and Van Hook 2002; Seltzer and Bianchi 2013; Swartz et al. 2011). For
instance, Pilkauskas et al. (2014) estimated that doubling up saved urban mothers with young
children $4,000-$5,000 USD in rent per year or approximately one-quarter of their yearly
earnings.
Importantly, coresidence and asset sharing can also act as investments into a child's further
success. In Sandberg-Thoma et al.'s (2015) study, children with higher levels of education took
longer to leave their parental homes but were less likely to return after moving out. Extended
coresidence among these households helped to provide youth with additional resources that
improved their later financial situations. In addition to functioning as an investment in a child's
future, higher rates of coresidence, especially among racial minority and immigrant families, also
stem from cultural preferences (Albertini and Kohli 2013; Hardie and Seltzer 2016; Kamo 2000;
Lei and Scott 2016). In these situations, coresidence is a more normative occurrence that does not
necessarily lead to economic insecurity.
Although economies of scale provide resources for some family members, research on
intergenerational transfers, social capital, and parental spending supports a second perspective,

10
which presents a more pessimistic outcome related to the costs of raising children. As expounded
by theories of social capital, individuals are embedded in systems of normative obligations, which
provide social and financial support for members (Bourdieu 1986; Coleman 1988; Portes 1998).
However, because family members often bring different levels of resources into relationships,
social capital can have both positive and negative effects (Portes 1998). In the case of
coresidence, adult children are able to draw on familial norms of trust and exchange within their
networks to improve their situations, but parents also make sacrifices to support their adult
children that can have lasting consequences (Furstenberg 2005; Kahn et al. 2013).
To summarize, previous research has shown that parental resources offer important
benefits to adult children, but extending resources, such as housing, can also hold negative
consequences for parents. Parents' lives are linked to those of their children, which is increasingly
obvious through the support provided for adult children, the consequences of which are likely to
be reflected in household assets and debt. By examining these variables, this study expands on
previous research to assess how coresidence with and support for adult children might influence
household economic security. In doing so, this research contributes to literature on family
relationships, life course studies, economic security, and wealth inequality more broadly.

Present Study
How are coresidence with and support for adult children associated with family assets,
debt levels, and economic security? And, can the relationship be explained by factors such as
family income, homeownership, and household size? In relation to the previous literature, I expect
that households who reside with adult children will have lower assets than other households net
of key demographic and employment characteristics (Hypothesis 1) for several reasons. First,
coresidence is more common among disadvantaged households (Swartz 2009; Weimers 2014),

11
and parents with fewer resources more often offer housing as a means of financial support to
children (Fingerman et al. 2015). Norms regarding nuclear family households and preferences for
independent living also make coresidence a last resort for the most economically disadvantaged
adult children (Amato et al. 2007; Fingerman et al. 2015). It follows that households with fewer
assets will also be more likely to reside with their adult children.
Second, coresidence and general support for adult children should lead to decreases in
parental assets over time as they share resources (Settersten and Ray 2010; Swartz et al. 2011).
Although wealth transfers to adult children are a normative occurrence, supporting children into
adulthood is expensive, regardless of where children live (Kornrich and Furstenberg 2013), and it
can be especially costly for youth who live at home. For instance, Schoeni and Ross (2005)
estimated that the average family spent approximately $4,500 to $5,000 USD per year supporting
youth between the ages of 18 to 34 who lived at home. Among those living independently, family
support averaged between only $1,000 and $1,700 USD per year.
In the area of debt, I expect that households who reside with adult children will have
greater non-home debt than other households net of key demographic and employment
characteristics (Hypothesis 2). Many families take on debt to make ends meet (Sullivan et al.
2000) and parents may secure loans to support their children's development and education (Cha et
al. 2005). In addition, total household debt also likely increases with the debt of the adult child.
Young adults today are more indebted than previous generations and a larger proportion of this
debt comes from student loans and non-secured debt (Dwyer et al. 2011; Houle 2014). These
trends, which coincide with increased parental support and coresidence, have also accelerated in
recent years as a result of the 2008 recession, at least according to research conducted in the
United States (Fry and Passel 2014; South and Lei 2015).

12
Together, the expected debt and asset effects have the potential to increase economic
insecurity within households when adult children rely on parents for support and continue to live
at home (Swartz et al. 2011). Even though coresidence can improve economic wellbeing for
certain members, particularly household guests, it is likely in this situation, where norms dictate
that parents will provide more support to children than they receive, that coresidential households
will be less stable than other living situations. This should become apparent in the relationship
between coresidence, assets, and debt.

Data
In order to cover multiple time periods, I tested these relationships using pooled data from
the 1999, 2005, and 2012 waves of the Canadian Survey of Financial Security, conducted by
Statistics Canada. The SFS is a reoccurring cross-national survey focused on net worth, debt, and
assets. The survey incorporates a stratified multi-stage dual frame design constructed from the
Canadian Labor Force Survey (LFS) and the urban portion of the T1 family file (Statistics Canada
2015). To account for this sampling design, all analyses applied the survey-provided integrated
household weights. Weights were adjusted for non-response and calibrated to known population
totals based on Canadian Census data.
Although the SFS appears to underestimate financial assets and consumer debt, which is
likely due to the complexity of wealth and the difficulty many respondents have in estimating
their assets and debt (Spilerman 2000), the survey includes some of the best wealth data available
in Canada, along with important data on household structure. To address potential data issues, the
survey combined responses with information from T1 income tax files and used hotdeck and
nearest neighbor matching imputation procedures to account for any additional missing data. The
survey also computed totals from detailed debt and asset variables, which improved the reliability

13
of estimates.
The SFS uses the economic family household, comprising a group of related individuals
living at the same address, as the unit of analysis. 2 In household-level studies researchers often
have trouble differentiating between household guests and hosts (Cohen and Casper 2002; Steele
et al. 2013). In these relationships, hosts have greater resources and more independence than
guests, who do not have homes of their own (Cohen and Casper 2002). Because the primary
respondent in a given household is the economically dominant single individual or the financially
most knowledgeable member of the economically dominant couple, I assumed that the respondent
was the host with whom the adult child was living. After restricting the sample to primary
respondents age 18 and older, a sample of 33,201 households remained.3

Measures
The two primary outcome variables – logged total non-home assets and logged total nonhome debt -- provide complementary measures of the household wealth situation. Following
Hacker et al. (2014), I excluded housing wealth as a measure of economic security because home
equity is hard for families to easily access and does not fluctuate as much each year. 4 This also
helped to make the results more generalizable to families in different contexts where total wealth
was less driven by the housing market. Total non-home assets include savings, stocks, bonds,
accessible pensions, and other types of liquid and illiquid assets. Total non-home debt includes
outstanding balances on credit cards, lines of credit, vehicle debt, education debt, traditional
consumer credit, and other types of loans. All monetary values were adjusted for inflation and

appear in 2012 Canadian dollars. I also logged these variables to account for skewness.
The secondary outcome variables assess the relationship between coresidence with ten
asset and debt components -- any financial assets present in stocks, savings, pensions, and other
accounts; logged total financial assets; any savings present in checking and savings accounts;
logged total savings; any pensions; logged total pension value; any credit card debt; logged total
credit card debt; any educational loan debt; and logged total educational loan debt. Analyzing
these variables disaggregated the components behind household assets and debt, which allowed
me to determine which specific asset and debt types influence economic insecurity the most.
The primary predictor variable measures the presence of adult children over age 18 in the
household. It includes biological and adopted children of the respondent or the respondent’s
partner. I constructed this variable using information on the age and status of household members
and the respondent’s relationship to these household members. As shown in Table 1, mean nonhome assets for households between 1999-2012 were $337,900, mean financial assets were
$56,700, and mean savings were $10,800. Mean non-home debt was $25,700, mean credit card
debt was $1,900, and mean education debt was $1,800.5 These values tended to be lower because
they included households who reported no debt or assets. In addition, although approximately
42.3% of young adults aged 20-29 lived with their parents in 2011 (Statistics Canada 2016),
15.5% of households reported adult children over 18 as present. The average household size was
2.4 persons with 28.4% of households reporting children under 18 present and 60.2% with two
adult partners.

15
Coresidence, assets, and debt also vary with demographics, disadvantaged group
membership, employment circumstances, and credit market access (Spilerman 2000). I therefore
controlled for these factors to account for different explanations of family and wealth inequality.
To address how wealth varies according to life-cycle models (Lafrance and La Rochelle-Côté
2012; Keister and Moller 2000), models controlled for the respondent’s age, along with a
quadratic age-squared term to account for non-linearity in this relationship. They also included
factors related to marital status and family size, which have been shown to influence wealth
(Grinstein-Weiss et al. 2008; Lupton and Smith 2003; Zagorsky 2005), as well as coresidence
(Swartz 2009). The first of these measures was household size or the number of people in the
family household, which also accounted for the presence of other extended relatives. Models also
controlled for whether any children under 18 were present in the household, and household type,
which included categories of two adult partners (referent), single male adult, and single female
adult.6
Because wealth and coresidence vary with disadvantaged group membership (Brzozowski
et al. 2009; Glick and Van Hook 2002; Maroto 2016; Maroto and Aylsworth 2016), the models
controlled for immigrant and disability status. I included a variable that indicates whether the
respondent or the respondent’s spouse became a landed immigrant to Canada as an adult and
incorporated a measure for whether the respondent, the respondent’s spouse, or a child within the
household reported a disability. In addition to demographic factors, education and income have
generally shown a positive association with asset and debt accumulation across studies
(Semyonov and Lewin-Epstein 2013). Education is also related to economic security, higher rates
of marriage, and lower rates of multigenerational living (Cancian and Haskins 2014; Kalmijn
2013). Education was accounted for with a variable the indicates whether the primary respondent
6

Partners include married or cohabitating couples and spouses.

16
obtained a high school diploma (referent); less than a high school diploma; some college, a
university or Bachelor’s degree; or advanced education beyond a BA. As measures of the
household labor market situation, models controlled for logged total household wage and salary
income and whether the respondent or spouse was employed.
The models also included a series of control variables to account for credit market access,
standing, and behavior. I incorporated categorical variables that indicate whether household
members owned their home or had a monthly budget and controlled for whether members of the
household provided financial assistance to individuals living outside the household. In addition to
being associated with credit market standing and income, this variable also helped to account for
potential assistance provided to adult children living outside the home.
Because wealth levels and rates of coresidence vary across Canada (Milan 2016), I
accounted for region of the country and size of the area of residence. Region includes the five
major regions of Canada -- Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies, and British Columbia. Area of
residence included three Census Agglomeration (CA) and two Census Metropolitan Area (CMA)
categories ranging from rural to populations greater that 500,000. Finally, an indicator for survey
year (1999, 2005, or 2012) was included in all models to account for change over time. The
analyses therefore incorporated controls related to key explanations for wealth inequality and
varying household structures.
As shown in Table 1, 17.4% of households contained individuals who immigrated to
Canada as adults and 20.4% reported a disability. Approximately 21.5% of respondents held a
Bachelor’s degree or higher in the sample. Nationally, 25.9% of the population reported earning
at least a university degree in 2011 (Statistics Canada 2013). Average employment income across
households was $58,800, and 73% of households had a least one employed member. Income
levels were close to those reported for the average after-tax income of Canadian households

17
between 1999 and 2012, which was approximately $60,000 (Statistics Canada 2017). Similar to
other credit market variables, 61.7% of households owned their homes and 47.3% organized
monthly budgets. Finally, 49.2% of households resided in urban areas with a population greater
that 500,000, and 37.1% lived in Ontario.

Methods
In order to reduce bias caused by treatment selection and effect heterogeneity, I combined
propensity score matching methods with regression models to study the relationship between the
presence of adult children in a household and a family’s logged non-home assets and debt.
Propensity score analysis techniques use observational data to create treatment and control groups
with similar characteristics based on propensity scores that reflect the estimated probability of
receiving treatment (i.e., coresidence) given a set of covariates (Morgan and Winship 2007;
Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Combining these techniques with regression models, then allows
for the better assessment of the direct relationship between coresidence and wealth across
matched samples.
In constructing these models, I first estimated propensity scores, which range from 0 to 1
based on the probability of having adult children present in the household, using a logit model
with all key covariates described in the measures section. I then used 1:1 nearest neighbor
matching to construct a matched sample of family households with and without adult children
present.7 Nearest neighbor matching uses propensity scores to match each household with adult
children to a similar household without adult children present (Ho et al. 2011). This process pairs
the observed outcome of a household in the treatment group with the outcome of the "nearest"
household in the control group. The models help to ensure balance on observed covariates across

matched samples. The final matched sample included a treatment group 5,022 households with
adult children present and a control group of 5,022 households without adult children present. 8
After creating matched samples of households with and without adult children present, I
then applied regression models to the matched datasets using all covariates from the matching
models. Logit models were used for the binary outcomes of any financial assets, accounts,
pensions, credit card debt, and education debt. Linear regression models were used for continuous
outcomes of logged non-home assets, non-home debt, total financial assets, account value,
pensions, credit card debt, and education debt. This resulted in "doubly robust regression," where
inferences will be statistically consistent if either the matching model or the regression model is
correct (Ho et al. 2011). As suggested by DuGoff et al. (2014) and Zanutto (2015), the sample
weight variables were incorporated as predictors in the matching equations and then conducted
the regression analyses on the weighted matched datasets. Regression models also accounted for
clustering in the standard errors through sandwich estimators.

Results
The results support a situation where coresidence and support for adult children had a
destabilizing (or at very least a non-stabilizing) effect on household economic security.
Households with adult children present had lower assets and increased debt compared to those
without adult children present. This relationship held within doubly robust regression models and
net of demographic, employment, and credit market controls. Additional analyses show that many
of these relationships also stemmed from specific types of assets and debt, especially financial
assets and student loans.

debt. All models control for demographic, employment, and educational factors, along with key
credit market control variables.

As expected by the Hypothesis 1, households with adult children present held less in
assets than those without adult children present, net of household demographics, education, and
income. According to Model 1, households with adult children present held approximately 18.2%
less in non-home assets than households without adult children.9 Model 2 shows that these
disparities were also present in relation to household debt, which provides support for Hypothesis
2. Within Canada, households with adult children present held twice as much debt as otherwise
similar households without adult children present. According to these models, it appears as
though the debt effects of coresidence were larger than the asset effects. 10
The models also included a host of control variables to help account for alternative
explanations of wealth inequality. 11 Among these variables, which are also already controlled for
through the creation of matched samples, age, income, education, and credit market variables
presented some of the strongest relationships with assets and debt. For instance, a one percent

9

Because many of these coefficients exceed 0.1, I use the following formula to determine the percent change in net
worth for a one-unit change in each predictor variable: %Δ(y) = 100*(eb – 1) (Wooldridge, 2009).

Models were robust to different specifications of assets and debt that included home equity and mortgages.

Because these models are based on the matched sample data, they are not generalizable to the broader population.

increase in income was associated with a 9.6% increase in assets and a 10.0% increase in debt.
Homeownership was also an important factor for both outcomes; homeowners held 4 times the
assets and 3 times as much debt as non-homeowners. Household size was also significantly
associated with debt and assets. Interestingly, net of other factors, each of the education categories
presented a significant association with assets but not debt. Among potentially disadvantaged
groups, immigrant households held 45.7% less in assets and 52.3% less in debt than nonimmigrant households. The presence of a disability was also negatively associated with assets but
positively associated with debt. Finally, households that provided assistance to individuals living
elsewhere held 34.6% more in assets and 53.1% more in debt than households not providing
assistance.

Specific Asset and Debt Types
As a supplement to these models, Tables 3 and 4 assess the relationship between
coresidence and a set of more specific asset and debt variables. Table 3 presents results from
models estimating the relationship between coresidence and the presence of any financial assets
that include stocks, savings, pensions, and other accounts (Model 1), logged total financial assets
(Model 2), any checking or savings accounts (Model 3), logged total value of funds in checking
or savings accounts (Model 4), any pensions (Model 5), and logged total pension value (Model 6).
Table 4 presents results from models estimating this relationship for any credit card debt (Model
1), logged total credit card debt (Model 2), any educational debt or student loans (Model 3), and
logged total value of educational and student loan debt (Model 4). All models were based on the
matched data and contained the same covariates present in Table 2.

[Table 3]

21
[Table 4]
The models in Table 3 show that the asset effects of coresidence were driven primarily by
financial assets and pensions, but not by funds present in savings or checking accounts.
Coresidence was associated with a 21.0% decrease in financial assets (Model 2) and a 34.7%
decrease in pension value, but it was not significantly associated with other asset outcomes. Thus,
it appears as though supporting adult children limited a family's ability to build assets and save for
retirement.
The models in Table 4, however, show that increases in both credit card and educational
debt were responsible for the relationship between coresidence and debt. Households with adult
children present held 33.6% more in credit card debt than households without adult children
living there (Model 2). In addition, coresidential households were 15.9 percentage points more
likely to hold educational debt and held more than 4 times as much in educational debt than noncoresidential households (Models 3 and 4). This indicates that many of the wealth effects of
coresidence likely stemmed from the costs of post-secondary education in Canada, which are
often taken on by both parents and their children.

Discussion
Although the models with this cross-sectional dataset are not causal, the results support a
situation where coresidence and the continued support provided by parents to adult children
destabilizes household resources and wealth across Canadian families. Even after accounting for
key explanations of wealth inequality and differences between coresidential and non-coresidential
households, households with adult children present held approximately 18% less in non-home
assets and carried twice as much in non-home debt when compared to otherwise similar
households without adult children present. These results stemmed from differences in financial

22
assets, retirement savings, credit card debt, and educational loans. Coresidential households held
21% less in financial assets, 35% less in retirement savings, 34% more in credit card debt, and 4
times more educational debt than non-coresidential households.
These results extend conceptions of household and family structure to illustrate the
complicated relationship between coresidence, support for adult children, assets, and debt. By
highlighting the destabilizing wealth consequences associated with supporting and residing with
adult children, this study demonstrates how financial hardship and economic insecurity can spread
throughout a household. Net of family size, the presence of adult children in the household was
associated with decreased assets, increased debt, and overall resource declines beyond the general
demands of larger families. However, these disparities also likely stemmed from the costs of
supporting adult children, as well as the greater obligations within parent-child relationships.
With increasing economic insecurity and declining social safety nets, children require ever more
support from their parents, which likely limits parental assets and can even motivate parents to
take on more debt. Economies of scale are less helpful in such situations because the sharing of
resources between parents and children is generally one directional -- downwards (Kahn et al.
2013).
In addition to showing the spread of financial hardship, this study addresses theories of
economic insecurity, social capital, and the life course. Life course theories and perspectives
grounded in economic insecurity both emphasize the importance of family and household
relationships for understanding inequality, and they both stress how social and historical contexts
influence trajectories of human development (Elder 1985; Elder et al. 2003). Parental obligations
further enhance the normative embeddedness present within families (Furstenberg 2005). The
trajectories and wellbeing of parents and children are tied, and these linkages continue even once
children reach adulthood. For some parents, children are an investment; parental support now will

23
be returned later. Increases in education debt mean that many adult children are obtaining degrees
that will likely improve their later wealth and earnings. However, the ability of children to support
parents later on will also depend on their financial situations and the broader economic context.
The results present further implications for policy within Canada and in other nations.
First, they show that greater investment in social safety nets is needed if policymakers want to
limit the financial hardship experienced by adult children from spreading to entire households.
Canada still boasts a more generous welfare system than countries like the United States, but cuts
to social assistance programs, such as Employment Insurance, throughout the 1990s and early
2000s, along with the continued declines of public investment in post-secondary education, have
left many families struggling to make ends meet (Banting and Myles 2013; Luong 2010). This has
had consequences for the wealth of parents and their adult children (Semyonov and LewinEpstein 2013). In this case, returning federal and provincial funding for higher education to earlier
levels would greatly help to limit the burdens placed on families.
Second, the findings highlight outcomes associated with increasing student loan and credit
card debt within Canada. Current wealth policies and programs, such as those encapsulated within
Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) tend to
focus on asset development and benefit those with greater wealth. However, the results show that
policy should also consider debt relief and payment, particularly within the area of student loan
forgiveness. As debt ratios continue to rise, this issue is likely to become more problematic in the
years to come (Chawla and Uppal 2012).
Despite its contributions, the research is still limited by the available measures and the
cross-sectional nature of the data. Models could have been strengthened by accounting for the
presence of adult children outside of the parental home within the models, but this measure was
not present in the data. I was able to incorporate controls for age and marital status, two variables

24
that are connected to parenthood and child age. Nevertheless, it is likely that some of the debt and
asset effects of coresidence also stem from the support that parents provide to adult children more
broadly, particularly for education purposes. In order to help account for this, models also
included a control for whether households provided financial support for individuals living
outside the household. Finally, future studies that include data on the specific situations of the
adult children, why they moved home, and the length of periods of coresidence would also offer
insight into heterogeneity among living situations.
In addition, even with the use of propensity score models that help to account for
selection, the cross-sectional data allowed me to demonstrate only associations among variables,
not causal order. Although propensity score matching models help to reduce confounding, they
cannot truly recreate a randomized experiment, nor can they demonstrate causality (DuGoff et al.
2014). As a result, these data complicated the ability to fully determine whether coresidence with
adult children decreased assets or whether families with fewer assets were more likely to live in
coresidential households. It is likely that both situations influence the relationship between
coresidence with adult children and wealth. Notably, however, coresidence was negatively
associated with assets and positively associated with debt even after accounting for income and
education, and in previous research parental wealth was not a strong predictor of coresidence
(Hardie and Seltzer 2016). This indicates that even more advantaged families likely experience
wealth declines when they support adult children living at home and elsewhere.
The study also shows that more research needs to be done in the areas of wealth inequality
and economic insecurity. In recent years, researchers have begun to focus more on the debt and
housing situations of young adults, but less research has examined how financial hardship can
spread to other family members. In the case of educational debt, it seems likely that the debts of
younger generations could be paid for, in part, by older generations who currently have greater

25
resources. Household dynamics and intergenerational transfers are central to understanding
broader aspects of wealth inequality and economic stability. Thus, studies that include
information on different types of financial transfers among household and family members, as
well as their wealth situations before and after coresidence, will help to provide additional insight
into these processes. Longitudinal studies using household panel data, such as the U.S. Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), that can show how family assets and debt change over time
would be further address some of the limitations of this current study. This research would also be
bolstered by qualitative studies that can shed light on family dynamics and the distribution of
resource within households.
Overall, parent-child relationships and the support that is given within these relationships
have long-term consequences for both generations (Elder 1985). With declining social safety nets
and rising economic insecurity, more young adults require assistance from their parents to make
the transition into adulthood in Canada. This support comes in many financial and non-financial
forms, with housing being one of the most common types, especially among less-advantaged
families. Although most young adults receive some financial aid from their parents, those who
live at home tend to receive greater support (Schoeni and Ross 2005). When the continued burden
of supporting young adults is placed on parents, however, declining assets and rising debt burdens
become one of many potential negative consequences.

Unit of analysis (cases) = households (restricted to households where respondent is 18 years or older).
Most variables refer to the household as a whole. However, certain demographic variables refer to the
respondent or the respondent's spouse or partner. "R" refers to the respondent. Respondent in most cases
is also the primary earner in the household. "SP" refers to the respondent's spouse or partner (if present).
