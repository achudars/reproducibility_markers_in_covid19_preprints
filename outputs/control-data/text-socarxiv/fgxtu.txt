Climate changes that occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) had significant
consequences in human eco-dynamics across Europe. Among the most striking impacts are the
demographic contraction of modern humans into southern refugia and the potential formation of a
population bottleneck. In Iberia and southern France transformations also included the occurrence
of significant technological changes, mostly marked by the emergence of a diverse set of
bifacially-shaped stone projectiles. The rapid dissemination of bifacial technologies and the
geographical circumscription of specific projectile morphologies within these regions have been
regarded as evidence for: (1) the existence of a system of long-distance exchange and social
alliance networks; (2) the organization of human groups into cultural facies with well-defined
stylistic territorial boundaries. However, the degree and modes in which cultural transmission have
occurred within these territories, and how it may have influenced other domains of the adaptive
systems, remains largely unknown. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, this paper presents the
first quantitative approach to the organization of lithic technology and its relationship to huntergatherers’ territorial organization during the LGM. Similarities and dissimilarities in the presence
of metric and morphological data describing lithic technologies are used as a proxy to explore
modes and degrees of cultural transmission. Statistical results show that similarities in
technological options are dependent on the chronology and geographical distance between sites
and corroborate previous arguments for the organization of LGM settlement in Southern Iberia
into discrete eco-cultural facies.

Introduction

31

Centered around c. 21 ka cal BP, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was a global climate event

32

characterized by the maximum expansion of the ice sheet over Scandinavia and northern Europe,

33

along with generally cold and arid conditions in central and western Europe [1–3].

34

Climatic changes occurred during this period had substantial repercussions in the geography,

35

technology, and social behavior of human populations in Europe. Among the most drastic impacts

36

are: (1) the contraction of the human range to southern regions of Europe that served as refugia,

37

such as the Iberian and the Italian peninsulas [4–11]; (2) the consequent genesis of a bottleneck

38

scenario in human genetic diversity [12–14]; (3) and, in southwestern Europe, the advent of a set

39

of new technologies for the manufacture of lithic projectiles and knives using bifacial retouch.

40

This latter feature is one of the main elements traditionally used to define the so-called Solutrean

41

techno-complex [15]. The Solutrean is a phenomenon geographically limited to southwestern

42

France and the Iberian Peninsula, presenting a moderately short chronological range (c. 25–19 ka

43

cal BP) when compared to other pan-European techno-complexes and representing, to a certain

44

extent, an outlier within the common background persisting throughout the Upper Paleolithic in

45

western Europe.

46

For its uniqueness and rough coincidence with the LGM, the Solutrean record often emerges as a

47

promising context for examining the mechanisms of formal and chronological change of lithic

48

tools during the late Pleistocene. Further, it has been recognized as an excellent opportunity to test

49

the possible links between the development of specific technical innovations and social behavior

50

under a particular climate setting [16–18].

2

51

In fact, besides the long-standing recognition of the several types of bifacial implements as secure

52

chrono-cultural markers, their presence across southwestern Europe, and the notion that they may

53

convey complex symbolic communication, has inspired many theories and models on social

54

networks, territorial organization, demographic changes, and the subsistence of hunter-gatherers.

55

Two perspectives have been particularly relevant over time. One that denotes the existence of a

56

system of long-distance exchange and alliance networks, based on the identification of uniform

57

techno-economic patterns across all of southern France and Iberia (including the use of bifacial

58

technologies, but also the presence of similar patterns in raw material selection, systematic use of

59

heat treatment and stylistic similarities in art) [19–21]. The other, in contrast, based on the

60

recognition of spatially-patterned bifacial typological traditions (e.g., Cantabrian vs

61

Mediterranean) [15,22–24], and justified by the existence of environmental/ecological constraints

62

[7,25], seem to have resulted in the delineation of stylistic territorial boundaries and an inherent

63

recognition of social group ownership by populations inhabiting rather distant regions [26,27].

64

Overall, these patterns attest a complex form of sharing behaviors occurring across different scales

65

during the LGM. From a demographic point of view, this implies the existence of a very dynamic

66

population circulating over significantly large territories, resulting in the permutation of different

67

kinds of information, including, very likely, genetic exchange [20,28].

68

Since most models on LGM territoriality, however, are based on the study of bifacial and

69

shouldered projectiles, there is a significant lack of information on how cultural transmission, on

70

the one hand, and regional ecology, on the other, may have influenced other domains of the

71

adaptive systems. Notably, it is still largely unknown to what extent technological organization

72

and, mostly, mental templates for lithic reduction sequences, were shaped by territorial

73

organization during this period. Are similarities within regions only expressed at the
3

74

symbolic/stylistic level, with communities sharing projectile morphologies and artistic elements

75

to express belonging to a common territory? Or, on the other hand, did the contexts in which long-

76

distance contacts seem to be present also exhibit similarities at other levels of the technological

77

system, including, for example, central tendencies in the lithic reduction sequences?

78

Answering these questions becomes particularly relevant given that bifacial tools, albeit important,

79

are just a singular component in LGM technological structures. Solutrean industries are mostly

80

composed of a non-bifacial techno-typological substrate [29,30], comparable to that present at any

81

other Upper Paleolithic techno-complex [31], that formed the basis for the production of a wide

82

range of blanks and tools.

83

In this context, this paper provides the first quantitative comparison between the non-bifacial

84

components of LGM lithic assemblages from a set of sites located at geographically distant regions

85

but within the same stylistic/cultural territory. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, specific

86

technological domains of the assemblages are statistically compared to explore scenarios of

87

territoriality and the organization of technology across the LGM.

88

89

LGM archaeology in southern Iberia

90

In Iberia, four cultural facies are distinguished based on the distribution of bifacial and/or

91

shouldered point types during the LGM (Figure 1). The southern part of the Peninsula encompasses

92

two of them, known as Mediterranean and Portuguese facies [23]. Both have in common the

93

presence of abruptly retouched shouldered points [32] and stemmed and winged projectiles

94

[33,34]. They are, however, separated by the fact that at some sites from central Portugal
4

95

Cantabrian-type shouldered points (with bifacial and flat retouch) are also documented [24]. This

96

separation between central Portugal and the remaining territory also became evident in previous

97

analysis of stemmed and winged projectiles morpho-metrics. Points from central Portugal are

98

generally larger, in both length and width [26,35], and present significantly different stem shapes

99

[36] than the ones from southern Portugal and Mediterranean Spain. While these patterns seem to

100

indicate some distinction between regions, the exclusive distribution of both projectile

101

morphologies below 40º N latitude conventionally attests the validity of using southern Iberia as

102

a broad cultural/stylistic unit. Artistic particularities, mostly from mobile art, also corroborate this

103

territorial homogeneity [37–41].

part of the Peninsula, sites used in this study are marked with a star.

108
109

In chronological terms, according to the traditional models [21,23,24,42–44], backed shouldered

110

projectiles and stemmed and winged points are only characteristic of the later phases of the

111

Solutrean techno-complex (i.e., Upper Solutrean and Solutreo-Gravettian). However, this

112

interpretation has been questioned in a recent Bayesian analysis of the currently available

113

radiocarbon data [45], calling into doubt the status of those type-fossils as precise temporal

6

114

markers, and confirming their presence throughout most of the LGM time-span (i.e., c. 25-19 ka

115

cal BP).

116

LGM settlement of southern Iberia is marked by the existence of more or less dense clusters of

117

sites, that are relatively isolated from one another by geographical hiatus where the complete

118

absence or the presence of very few sites might testify human passage but not likely intensive

119

occupation [46,47]. Caves and rock-shelters are better represented than open-air locations, as are

120

multi-component sites over single horizon ones [27,45]. There is evidence for the existence of

121

different types of sites, including long-term and seasonal residential camps, shorter specialized

122

occupations, lithic cache sites, and possible aggregation sites [48]. The number of occupied sites

123

is significantly higher than during the early Upper Paleolithic and, although they tend to be in

124

coastal or near-coastal settings, inland camps are also represented, mainly as single-occupation

125

localities [49,50].

126

Rather problematic is the quality of the available data from most of these sites. More than half of

127

the occurrences are surface or mixed contexts, suffering from several limitations (e.g., lack of

128

organic materials, presence of small and/or highly truncated lithic assemblages, and occurrence of

129

thick palimpsest deposits - [21,27,45,51,52]).

130

Probably as a result of this scenario, technological analyses of LGM lithic materials are (as well

131

as faunal analysis) very limited in southern Iberia. These are mostly restricted to intra-site

132

descriptions and evaluation of the assemblages [23,35,46,47,53] and, very rarely, presenting inter-

133

site or regional comparisons using technological patterns for the construction of clear

134

paleoanthropological testable hypothesis [54].

7

135

Two rare examples are the studies conducted by Zilhão [24] and Schmidt [36]. The first, focusing

136

on central Portugal, uses assemblage composition and raw material circulation to report a scenario

137

of logistically organized resource-procurement strategies within the region. Body adornments

138

distribution and technological data allowed the author to further suggest the organization of the

139

region into smaller territories corresponding to different ethnic groups, sharing specific traditions

140

but all inserted within the same ethnic boundary.

141

The second study addresses Iberia as a whole and compares the technological organization behind

142

the manufacture and use of the different types of lithic projectiles. Previously referred significant

143

differences between northern and southern Iberia are corroborated in this study, and the main

144

outcome is that synchronic variability of Solutrean points between those regions does not only

145

relate to stylistic variations, but to regional differences deeply rooted in the distinct technological

146

strategies of tool making and tool use. Corroborating Zilhão [24] the author states that: “the

147

technological design of southern Iberian points (…) encompasses criteria of toolkits ascribed to

148

logistical mobility of collectors, with a high functional specialization of the points, and evidence

149

at `base camps’ for batch production” [36].

150

Both models seem to confirm the scarce data coming from faunal studies [55,56] that demonstrate

151

a seasonal movement of residential sites between coastal areas and the mountainous hinterland,

152

and possibly a perennial occupation of few major sites across southern Iberia [54].

153

In sum, paleoanthropological models for LGM hunter-gatherer adaptations in southern Iberia are

154

currently rather limited [20,57,58] and mostly based on the typo-technological analysis of bifacial

155

and shouldered projectiles or other “style-embedded” elements. Some of these elements report, on

156

the one hand, significantly homogeneous patterns across the region and, on the other, regional

157

particularities that suggest the organization of settlement into smaller socio-cultural territories.

158

159

Theoretical framework for cultural transmission processes

160

The diffusion of specific concepts across southern Iberia, as rapidly as it seems to have occurred

161

during the LGM, may have resulted from an array of very diverse contact behaviors.

162

Ethnoarchaeological data [59–61] has demonstrated that the process of social interaction between

163

hunter-gatherer communities can vary between episodes in which people have little contact to each

164

other’s domestic space (with gatherings occurring at the edge of their respective ranges), to events

165

in which marriage partners are exchanged, and previously foreign individuals become fixtures in

166

each other’s residential lives [62,63]. Contacts occurring anywhere between these two extremes of

167

the contact scale result in dissimilar access to information, and to different types of information.

168

In the case of LGM projectiles and remaining shared concepts, both hypotheses are viable to have

169

occurred. The design concepts of shouldered and stemmed and winged projectile points may have

170

been disseminated in intimate cultural environments with access to the full production sequences,

171

or it may, on the contrary, be the outcome of independent innovation by exposure to curated tools

172

and not necessarily to the complete technological mechanisms. Within this latter scenario,

173

although it is possible that an individual could independently develop some of the behaviors of

174

point production from examining a finished tool, it is rather unlikely that he/she would use the

175

same procedures, techniques, and methods, during the knapping process. Thus, understanding the

176

complete production process is of great importance to distinguish between modes but mostly

177

degrees of social contact, and how these vary across time. Focusing exclusively on information

178

coming from projectiles morphologies, as well as on any other class of traditionally considered

179

style-embedded items (i.e., portable art, ornaments, lithic retouched tools), will only allow to
9

180

explore the patterns of presence/absence of contacts and not the possible nature of those contacts.

181

Further, using LGM bifacial reduction sequences and projectile manufacture in southern Iberia to

182

shed light on the technological processes is a somehow hampered task. Patterns of segregation of

183

the production sequence, which comprise shaping of preforms at sites close to rich raw material

184

sources on the one hand, and export of preforms and finished points to other locations on the other

185

hand [23,36], can severely truncate the variability of technological procedures. Since, however,

186

the available information on point production attests, in a large number of cases, that bifacial points

187

were obtained from blanks produced within non-bifacial reduction sequences [24,35,64], a

188

reasonable approach is to look at the non-bifacial technology of the assemblages and check for

189

patterns of similarity/dissimilarity in the distribution of specific methods and concepts within the

190

reduction sequence continuum.

191

Such kind of analysis requires, however, a theoretical and methodological framework that would

192

allow the integration of both social interactions and ecological background as shapers of stone

193

knapping patterns across space and time. While there are many ethnoarchaeological and theory-

194

based studies addressing the meaning of morphological variations of lithic tools as indicators of

195

style and territorial differentiation, very few attempts have been made to use technological

196

processes as proxies for cultural transmission processes. The middle-range theory presented by

197

Tostevin [62,63], for studying the material evidence of social contact between Neanderthals and

198

Anatomically Modern Humans using lithic technology, is perhaps one of the most compelling and

199

sophisticated approaches. Based on a body of literature on artefact style [59,65–69], optimization

200

studies [70–73] and experimental knapping [74–77], Tostevin’s model seeks to identify whether

201

variation in lithic material culture style reflects one or more social processes, once other sources

202

of variability have been dismissed.
10

203

The present paper adopts the same body of theory to inform a technology-based approach (see

204

methods below).

205

Ethnography has shown that technological gestures are not just individual action sequences with

206

clearly defined goals, but suites of distributed behaviors reflecting complex systems that have been

207

learned and assimilated as bodily techniques. In this context, flintknapping processes are

208

considered “technological performances which can only be effectively taught and learned by

209

observation of the body movements, the handling of core and percussor, and the flake by flake

210

strategizing on how to exploit core volumes” [63]. Lithic reduction is a directional and irreversible

211

process characterized by a sequence of mechanical relationships. While these relationships are

212

influenced by multiple contextual, aspects, such as the quality of the available raw material,

213

identifying different exploitation patterns within these mechanical relationships are thought to

214

reflect a purposeful choice of particular modes of technological manipulation present in an

215

assemblage out of an equifinal pool of alternative possibilities - what Sackett [68,78,79] have

216

called isochrestic variation .

217

Based on this theoretical approach, it is assumed here that the characterization and comparison of

218

the central tendencies of lithic attributes distribution within specific and comparable clusters of

219

technological decisions can be used as indicators of behavior differentiation. In this way it is

220

possible to assess how knappers responsible for different assemblages solve problems, react to

221

different circumstances and produce artifacts according to specific learned methods, resulting in

222

the variability detected among assemblages. It is also assumed, thus, that technological and

223

technical choices, whether conscious or not, taken by knappers are integral components of cultural

224

life and are “largely dictated by the technological traditions within which they have been

225

enculturated as members of the social groups that delineate their ethnicity” [68]. The same choices
11

226

can though be subject to revision as a result of changes in the patterns of social interaction between

227

groups.

228

Consequently, the greater the similarities recorded between assemblages, the greater the

229

probability of concepts exchange to have occurred between knappers responsible for different

230

archaeological assemblages, most likely in a context of social intimacy, with full access to

231

technological conceptual schemes. On the contrary, if dissimilarities are more evident, than either

232

technological practices transmission occurred in the context of a low degree of social intimacy,

233

and/or ecological and cultural [80,81] regional constraints did not allow the generalization of basic

234

technological patterns.

235

This study builds, therefore, upon the theoretical assumption that the amount of lithic technological

236

knowledge, learned and adopted by hunter-gatherers, depends upon how and where learning

237

occurs and may reflect differential access to particular enculturating environments, and thus “are

238

determined by the mechanics of how the traits are transmitted from individual to individual and

239

by the stochastic events associated with these” [82].

240

The model expectations for different modes of cultural transmission during the LGM in southern

241

Iberia based on technological analysis of lithic attributes presented in this paper are summarized

242

in Table ??. Similar approaches using lithic technology as a proxy for demography and cultural

243

transmission have been applied in several other studies [62,83–85].

248

Some caveats are associated with the expectations presented since they result from a complex

249

interplay among patterns of inheritance, interaction, and local adaptation. Whereas equifinality and

250

the restricted options inherent to leptolithic technologies may result in similar technological trends,

251

even within communities with none or very little contact; aspects such as chronology, functional

252

variability, and ecological constraints (e.g., raw material variability) may influence the presence

253

of significantly different lithic attributes among populations with a high degree of interaction. Most

254

of these alternative explanations are related to several adaptive behaviors as they are organized

255

across different temporal and geographical scales, within which technological organization is

256

composed of a set of problem-solving processes that are responsive to conditions created by the

257

interplay between hunter-gatherers and their environment [86]. Nonetheless, even in the presence

258

of rather different assemblages due to specificities related with contextual aspects there is, based

259

on the theoretical framework presented above, and based on the assumption that all behavior may,

260

in one sense or another, be regarded as purposeful, always a bound between technological practices

261

and the definition of a particular social/cultural unit. Contextual constraints were, however, not

262

downplayed in the course of the analysis and interpretation of results obtained in this study.

263

Additionally, the focus on a small-scale analysis, taking full advantage of statistical methods, and
13

264

targeting meaningful comparability between contexts were purposefully used in this approach to

265

reduce the negative impact of possible errors and uncertainty.

277

Vale Almoinha (VALM) is a single LGM occupation open-air site located in the Portuguese

278

Estremadura. It was first excavated by Manuel Heleno in the late 1940s and relocated and dated

279

by Zilhão in 1986 [87]. The site is located in a small inland valley at c. 1.5 km from the present-

280

day coastline. Two radiocarbon dates on charcoal samples are available, dating the archaeological

281

horizon to c. 24-24.5 ka cal BP [24]. Previous analysis of the lithic materials [24,88] revealed an

282

assemblage dominated by chert, some quartzite and residual presence of quartz. Core maintenance

283

products are well represented. Lithic analysis revealed the presence of two distinct approaches,

284

one for the specific production of laurel-leaves and other to produce flakes and elongated blanks.

285

Laurel-leaf points are the well-most represented tool type, followed by unifacial flat-retouched

286

points, willow-leafs and two, questionable [36], shouldered points. The overall characteristics of

287

the assemblage and site context allowed Zilhão [24] to characterize it as a semi-permanent base

288

camp, in which are represented the various phases of the chaîne operatoire.

289

Vale Boi (VB) is a multilayered and multicomponent (open-air and rock shelter) site located in the

290

southwesternmost extreme of Iberia (southern Portugal). The site is situated in the eastern side of

291

a wide valley, 2.5 km inland from the present-day coastline, occupying a wide portion of a

292

relatively steep slope, marked by the presence of a 10-15 m high limestone cliff on the top. LGM

293

occupations are attested across all excavated areas, but the most complete sequence was identified

294

below the boulders resulting from the collapse of a relatively large rock shelter [89]. Six

295

radiocarbon dates indicate that Solutrean occupations at VB rock shelter started somewhere around

296

25 ka cal BP and ended shortly before c. 20.5 ka cal BP [45,47]. Previous analysis of lithic

297

assemblages revealed the presence of backed shouldered and stemmed and winged points across

298

the sequence of three lithostratigraphic units defined during excavation. Chert, quartz, and
15

299

greywacke are the most common lithic materials recovered, all provisioned locally, from deposits

300

situated no more than 15-20 km from the site. The density and diversity of findings, together with

301

data from faunal analysis [55,90], allowed the classification of VB as a seasonal residential camp.

302

Ambrosio (AMB) rock shelter is located in the eastern part of Andaluzia, positioned at an elevation

303

of 1060 meters above sea level, and distant 60 km from the Mediterranean coast. The shelter has

304

a south-southwest orientation and a triangular shape whose entry measures c. 39 meters wide by

305

c. 19 meters in height and extends c. 17 meters into the Miocene limestone [53]. The site was

306

excavated by Eduardo Ripoll Perelló between 1958 and 1964 and by Sergio Ripoll Lopez from

307

1982 onwards, and it is mostly known for the Solutrean parietal art [91]. The Pleistocene sequence

308

is marked by a series of Solutrean occupations organized by the excavators into three distinct

309

horizons, separated by clast-supported levels with fewer materials. Recent AMS radiometric

310

results contradict previous standard dates, indicating that the most recent occupation occurred at

311

c. 24 ka cal BP. Backed shouldered and stemmed and winged points are present throughout levels

312

II and IV but completely absent from level VI. As in the VB case, this site has been classified as a

313

seasonal residential camp.

314

The Parpalló (PAP) cave is located in a wide valley, some 6 km from the present coastline. At

315

c. 600 meters above sea level the cavity entrance is marked by a relatively narrow breach, which

316

gives access to the main room with c. 80 m2. The first work was by Breuil in 1913. Later, between

317

1920 and 1930, L. Pericot undertakes a series of campaigns resulting in the almost complete

318

excavation of the archaeological deposits [34]. With close to 8.5 meters of thickness, the

319

stratigraphy at PAP comprises Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian occupations. Unfortunately,

320

excavation was done by subdividing the deposits into artificial spits of 20-25 centimeters and

321

screening all sediments using large meshes [23]. Standard radiocarbon ages are available for levels
16

322

5’00-4’75 and 4’25-4’00, that, after Bayesian analysis date the horizons to c. 22.5-23 ka cal BP

323

[45]. Shouldered and stemmed and winged points are present throughout the sequence but clearly

324

are better represented in levels between 5.25 and 4.25 meters in depth [23,43]. This site was

325

possibly used as a residential space, although the remarkable and unique amount of recovered

326

engraved slabs [40] might indicate the presence of some symbolic or ritualistic functionality.

327

Given the size of the Spanish assemblages, materials were sampled in the case of AMB from the

328

1986 campaign [53], and in the case of PAP from sector L [23]. Although randomly selected, the

329

representativeness of these samples within each site is thought to be good, given the large portion

330

of the excavation area they represent.

331

For the three karstic contexts, a diachronic subdivision of the assemblages was also implemented

332

based on the available lithostratigraphic information and previous analysis of the materials

333

[23,43,47,53]. This subdivision resulted in a total of 10 contexts, representing, as much as possible,

334

the chronological and geographical variability of LGM adaptations in southern Iberia.

335

All sites are radiocarbon dated, yet direct comparisons between contexts are problematic given the

336

sometimes very large standard deviations of the results.

337

Further, all four chosen sites are located near raw material sources, and thus all assemblages have

338

been characterized as primary flaking assemblages, containing features such as a reasonable

339

number and diversity of core maintenance pieces and large cortical flakes. A significant difference

340

between sites is in the diversity of raw materials used. Although chert is always dominant, in

341

Portuguese assemblages a greater diversity of materials is present. In the case of VB, non-siliceous

342

raw materials were used not as alternatives to chert but for very specific functional purposes [47].

343

This pattern is consistent with that recorded for nearly all upper Paleolithic sites in the western
17

344

Atlantic facade of Iberia even when good-quality chert is available within walking distance [92].

345

To avoid a possible impact on assemblage comparability caused by the use of different raw

346

materials, only chert artifacts were selected for this study. This restriction was also imposed by the

347

composition of the assemblages since for both Spanish sites it was not possible to identify more

348

than a handful of artifacts made on other materials than chert, a fact that is also evident in previous

349

publications for Ambrosio [53].

350

351

Methods

352

Complete cores and blanks were analyzed using a set of technological variables and attributes,

353

specifically chosen to allow the isolation of separate sources of variability, including raw material

354

constraints and learned behaviors (see Supplementary Online Material [SOM] Tables S1, S2 and

355

S3 for a complete list of attributes and measurement techniques).

356

Following the theoretical background of Tostevin [62,63], Scerri [93] and Scerri et al. [84], in this

357

study variables were organized into comparable heuristic domains (i.e. Platform Maintenance,

358

Core Exploitation, Dorsal Convexities Management, Elongated blanks Production, Core

359

Morphology, and Core Use) of the technological sequences, to achieve a comprehensive structure

360

of similarity and dissimilarity between assemblages. The main goal of using these domains was to

361

isolate different sources of variability by focusing on specific sets of interrelated variables that

362

correspond to interdependent knapping actions. Breaking down the reduction sequences into

363

comparable clusters makes possible to account for possible biased samples and “broken”

18

364

sequences, not assuming that the knapping process was restricted to a specific timeframe, or the

365

work of a single individual [84].

366

The chosen variables, and respective combinations, were based on the traditional parameters used

367

in lithics attribute analysis [94,95] and the results of experimental studies available in the literature

368

[74–77,96–100]. For example, controlled knapping experiments show that blank dimensions and

369

shape are significantly affected by variations in exterior platform angles, platform depths and

370

platform preparation (e.g., faceting) [98,101]. Thus, by considering variables such as platform type

371

and blank elongation (length/width ratio) as a set of interrelated variables, the way knappers

372

differently exploited these variables can be assessed and compared across assemblages. The same

373

is true for other domains, such as the exploitation of dorsal surface convexities or the management

374

of core morphology, all with direct impact on blank morphometrics.

375

A multivariate statistical approach was used to explore the interaction of variables within each

376

domain. Since most of the attributes available were categorical, a Multiple Correspondence

377

Analysis (MCA) was used to explore the orthogonal dimensions of variability in the data. MCA is

378

well suited to lithic analysis because it allows the isolation of the different sources of variability

379

contributing to the character of each assemblage under study. When used, metric variables were

380

pooled into categories using a K-means clustering algorithm. To reduce the amount of ‘noise’ in

381

the overall variability, all categorical attributes whose representation was less than 5% within each

382

variable were also lumped together into a category named ‘Other’, before any of the analysis were

383

performed.

384

Following Scerri et al. [84] the scores and loadings of the most relevant dimensions calculated by

385

the MCA were used to identify and explore the relative contributions of aspects such as reduction

386

intensity, raw material constraints, or particular knapping styles. To analyze the main sources of
19

387

variability behind the technological character of each assemblage separately, and to assess the

388

similarities and differences between contexts, the individual scores of each relevant component of

389

the MCA were statistically tested by applying an analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA tests

390

and corresponding post hoc comparisons were run using a percentile t bootstrapped approach for

391

trimmed means (trim level was set at 20%) as implemented by Mair and Wilcox [102]. This

392

approach intended to prevent problems related to heavy-tailed distributions, unequal sample sizes,

393

and possible differences in skewness distributions of the samples. The location of individuals,

394

grouped by assemblages in the multivariate dimensions, was bootstrapped 5000 times in all tests.

395

All analyses and data processing were accomplished in R (version 3.6.1) [103]. The complete R

396

code used for all the analysis and visualizations contained in this paper is available at

397

http://www.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YD2VE. To produce those files the procedures described

398

by Marwick et al. [104] for the creation of research compendiums to enhance the reproducibility

399

of research were followed. The files provided contain all the raw data used in our analysis as well

400

as a custom R package [105] holding the code to produce all tables and figures. To enable

Results

405

General characteristics of the assemblages

406

The total number of artifacts for each context used in this study is presented in Table 3. The most

407

numerous assemblages are, respectively, PAP 4’00-4’75 (n = 2743) and VB B (n = 1723), and the
20

408

less numerous are AMB II (n = 540), and VB A (n = 493). Cores represent between two and eight

409

percent of the assemblages. VALM is the site with the highest percentage of cores (c. 8.52%), and

410

a rather low blank to core ratio (10.74) when compared to the other contexts.

414

Differences in a possible segregation of the reduction sequences seem not significant between

415

sites, with small variation occurring in the ratios of cortical to non-cortical blanks. The only

416

exceptions are the two oldest horizons from PAP and VB, which reveal the highest presence of

417

cortical elements among all assemblages. This pattern might be related to the use of different raw

418

material sources, or particular technological schemes applied during core reduction. The second

419

option seems, however, the most reasonable since differences are also evident between these two

420

contexts and the remaining assemblages, regarding the proportion of flakes and blanks with lengths
21

421

equal or greater than twice their width (elongated blanks). This type of blanks is, in fact, less

422

frequent within all complete blanks in these contexts. Additionally, a progressive change into the

423

production of elongated products is clear at both multi-layered Spanish sites, but it is not present

424

at the VB sequence. This chronological trend seems to go along with a process of microlitization

425

of the elongated products during the LGM, already noted in previous works [46], and also

426

manifested at VB [35].

427

As it is shown in Figure 2, however, the reduction sequences for elongated blanks seem to have

428

followed an unimodal tendency in all assemblages. No clear separation between blade and bladelet

429

production is attested within contexts and thus, as in other studies [107], the traditional subdivision

430

[108] was not used in the statistical tests below, where both classes were grouped as a single

431

elongated blanks category.

432
433

434

22

435

In what regards to relative flaking intensities, there are some relevant differences among the

436

assemblages used in this study. Figure 3 shows the comparison of density plots for three variables

437

- maximum length of core’s dominant scar, maximum length of primary elements (considered here

438

as blanks with more than 25% cortex on their dorsal surface), and maximum length of non-cortical

439

blanks. Following Henry [109], an assemblage which displays core scar dimensions that are near

440

equal to those of primary elements and fall within the upper range of the blank dimensions is one

441

in which cores were still usable. Most of the assemblages seem to be broadly comparable in this

442

regard, except for PAP 4’75-5’25 and VALM, which reveal a significant number of very reduced

443

cores, presenting average scar lengths much smaller than the length of primary blanks and, more

444

importantly, falling within the lower range of the non-cortical blanks.

and fully cortical blanks (magenta). Following Henry [109] the plots show the relative flaking intensity
between the assemblages. For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
referred to the web version of this article.

450

23

451

Flaking intensity comparison is also demonstrated by the complementary analysis presented in

452

Figure 4, which represents the interaction between blanks area (Width X Length), number of scars,

453

and the amount of cortical surface on the dorsal surface. All assemblages present a typical decrease

454

in the average size of blanks and percentage of cortex with an increase in the number of scars,

455

confirming that all contexts are comparable in what concerns to the general reduction continuum.

456

These results also imply that all three variables can be used as a good indicator for reduction

457

intensity within each assemblage [109–112].

458
459
460

Figure 4: Comparison of the interaction between scar number and area of blanks by cortex frequency for
each assemblage in this study.

461
462

All these patterns seem to corroborate an overall broad comparability of the assemblages. As

463

expected, some reservations should be taken regarding the site of VALM, which seems, in the first

464

instance, to present technological idiosyncrasies. These are mostly related with a lower blank to

465

core ratio, the fact that the cores seem to be more reduced than expected, and the dimensions of

466

the elongated blanks being amongst the largest of all the studied assemblages. Two reasons may
24

467

be behind this pattern: either some of the late production blanks were exported from the site, or

468

the methods used during the excavation of the site (in the late 1940s, the early 1950s) did not allow

469

the recovery of smaller materials. This latter hypothesis is perhaps the most parsimonious, given

470

the small amount of chips available from the site [24].

471

Despite the particularities mentioned above, the overall assemblage compositions are identical.

472

Together with the fact that all assemblages are considered primary flaking sites located close to

473

raw materials sources, and that all have been previously classified as residential contexts,

474

similarities in flaking intensities and reduction tendencies somehow guarantee a higher degree of

475

certainty in the comparisons made by the tests presented below.

476
477

Blank analysis

478

The analysis of blanks was organized into four domains. The first, second and third approaches

479

considered all blanks to analyze and compare strategies of platform maintenance and the

480

exploitation of dorsal convexity systems during the reduction sequence of cores. The fourth

481

domain included only one class of blanks (elongated blanks), aiming to characterize and compare

482

the organization of relevant attributes for the production of blanks with length equal or twice their

483

width. Frequencies for all attributes recorded for blanks in each assemblage are presented as

484

Supplementary Online Materials (Table S3).

485

25

486

Platform maintenance

487

The analysis of platform maintenance aimed to explore how knappers managed platform

488

characteristics to control blank dimensions and morphology across the reduction sequences. This

489

approach was accomplished by investigating the relationship between platform type, dorsal cortex

490

percentage, and blank elongation (length/width ratio). As in Scerri [84], the external platform angle

491

measurements were not available for this analysis. Considering, however, the high degree of

492

correlation between that variable and blank elongation [113], the latter was used as a proxy for

493

possible changes in the management of the external platform angle. The results from the

494

application of a MCA to this set of variables are presented in Figure 5.

495

The first two dimensions of the MCA solution represent 39.6% of the overall variability. The first

496

dimension (26%) is marked by the correlation between blanks with cortical platforms, higher

497

presence of cortex in the dorsal surface, and low elongation ratios, on the one hand, and blanks

498

without dorsal cortex, crushed platforms, and high elongation, on the other hand. In the second

499

dimension (13.6%), both cortical and crushed platforms are positively associated with high

500

amounts of cortex, while faceted platforms are associated with medium values (26-75%) of dorsal

501

cortex. These results suggest that for almost 40% of the overall variability in this domain, different

502

strategies of platform preparation are associated with different stages of the reduction sequences.

503

The bootstrapped ANOVA multiple comparison results for both dimensions of the MCA are

504

shown in Figure 6. Negative loadings for Dimension 1, marked by the dominance of crushed

505

platforms and high elongation ratios, are associated with all the assemblages from AMB and the

506

more recent horizon of PAP, with no statistical difference detected between AMB II and PAP

507

4’00-4’75, on the one hand, and AMB IV and AMB VI, on the other. The remaining contexts,

26

508

except for VALM, are all associated with the positive loadings of Dimension 1, marked by lower

509

elongation ratios, and higher frequencies of dorsal cortex and cortical platforms. What seems

510

relevant, however, is that this latter trend is counterpointed with an inversion of results in

511

Dimension 2, with the earliest assemblages of all multi-layered sites and VALM being associated

512

with higher frequencies of faceted platforms for the exploitation of partially decorticated flaking

513

surfaces, not correlated with any particular elongation category. This pattern is noteworthy since

514

it seems to show a tendency towards the abandon of platform faceting over time in multi-layered

515

sites, more pronounced at PAP and AMB than in VB.

525

Direction of Core Exploitation

526

The analysis of core exploitation using blanks aimed to characterize the way cores were rotated by

527

knappers to create different dorsal surface convexity patterns during the sequences of reduction.

528

A combination of dorsal cortex frequency, dorsal pattern, and number of scars in the dorsal surface

529

was used in the MCA. Results are presented in Figure 7.

530

The first two dimensions of the MCA solution represent close to 61% of the overall variability.

531

Dimension 1 (38.5%) contrasts the positive loadings for other patterns of a diverse set of flaking

532

strategies during early stages of core exploitation, to the use of bidirectional or unidirectional

533

strategies in more advanced stages of the sequence. Dimension 2, representing 23.2%, opposes the

534

production of blanks with few dorsal scars, using unidirectional strategies in partially decorticated
28

535

flaking surfaces, to the use of bidirectional strategies from completely decorticated flaking

536

surfaces, resulting in blanks with a high number of dorsal scars.

537

Figure 8 presents the results of the multi-comparison bootstrapped ANOVA to the individuals’

538

loadings of the MCA for the dimensions just described. While all the assemblages are only related

539

to the negative loadings of Dimension 1. This does not imply that the initial stages of reduction

540

are absent from the assemblages, but rather, as it would be expected, that they are, overall, less

541

represented than later phases of the sequence. The distribution of contexts through Dimension 2 is

542

perhaps more interest in this regard, since it shows a clear separation between VALM and PAP

543

4’00-4’75 (due to a dominant presence of bidirectional methods) and the remaining set of contexts.

544

In the latter group, however, which is clearly associated with the use of unidirectional strategies

545

on partially decorticated flaking surfaces, VB and the oldest occupation at PAP occupy the most

546

extreme positions, being significantly different from the other PAP and AMB assemblages.

556

Dorsal Surface Convexity

557

The influence of flaking surface convexities in the overall morpho-metrics of a blank has been

558

demonstrated by sereval authors [63,113,114]. In short, the ridge pattern of the dorsal surface of

559

flakes determines the path of the resulting flake because the ridges guide the force of the percussor

560

blow. Changes in the shape of the debitage surface morphology affect the dimensions of the

561

resulting blanks by changing the distribution of mass over the said blank. In this analytical domain,

562

a set of variables related to shape, including Elongation and Flattening ratios, Cross-section, Edge

563

shape, and Profile are examined for all blanks. The aim of this approach is to assess patterns of

564

blank morphological variation of each context under study, to evaluate possible

565

differences/similiarities on how knappers controlled surface convexities during core exploitation.

30

566

Figure 9 present the results of the MCA applied to these set of variables. Close to 32% of the

567

overall variability is explained by the first two dimensions. Dimension 1 (22.2%) opposes blanks

568

with high flattening and low elongation ratios and irregular or lenticular cross-sections, to highly

569

elongated blanks with parallel edges and trapezoidal cross-sections. Dimension 2, on the other

570

hand, is marked by significant positive loadings for irregular edge shapes, profiles and cross-

571

sections, and negative loadings for high flattening ratios and lenticular cross-sections.

572

The distribution of mean values from each context across the two first dimensions are presented

573

in Figure 10. As in the previsous domains, the two youngest assemblages from PAP and AMB are

574

clearly separated from the remaining ones, marked mostly by the predominance of high elongation

575

ratios with parallel edges and trapezoidal cross-sections.

585

Elongated blanks techno-morphology

586

For the fourth MCA applied to the blanks sample, only the elongated blanks category was used.

587

This isolation aimed to explore the organization of attributes in this particular technological class,

588

given its relative importance in the tool kits of the assemblages under study. Selected variables

589

included Dorsal pattern, Distal termination, Dorsal scar number, and Profile type. The results are

590

presented in Figure 11.

591

The first two dimensions cumulatively represent c. 37% of the overall variability. In Dimension 1

592

a marked distinction is made between unidirectional strategies for the production of pointed blanks

593

with straight profiles, and bidirectional patterns used to produce a variety of distal terminations in

594

blanks with complex dorsal biographies and curved profiles. All assemblages from VB and AMB,
32

595

as well as the oldest context of PAP, are positively correlated with the positive loadings of

596

Dimension 1 (Figure 12). However, the multi-comparison post hoc analysis denotes a significant

597

difference between VB and the Spanish sites, underscoring the very low frequency of bidirectional

598

strategies at VB. VALM, PAP 4’00-4’75, and PAP 4’75-5’25, on the contrary, are all driven by

599

the negative scores of Dimension 1. In this component, VALM occupies an extreme position,

600

mostly due to the high number of removals recorded in the dorsal surfaces of the blanks, which

601

somehow confirms the abovementioned patterns of more intensive core reduction at this site. In

602

Dimension 2 (11.2%), the occurrence of twisted blades and bladelets do not seem correlated with

603

any of the other variables used. Twisted profiles are, however, better represented in all the

604

assemblages but not at VB and VALM, which are instead dominated by a mixture of different

605

morphologies.

615

Core analysis

616

The analysis of cores involved two separate domains. One related to the morphological patterns of

617

the abandoned cores, and the other to core use and variation in reduction techniques. The following

618

points describe the overall results for the two core domains comparisons using the MCA and

619

ANOVA multi-comparison results. The statistical results presented for cores should be carefully

620

considered given the available sample sizes and the fact that core analysis only considers a static

621

moment of the reduction continuum.

622

Core Morphology

623

This domain of analysis aimed to compare central tendencies in core morpho-metrics using both

624

metric (Elongation, Flattening, and Weight) and the categorical variables Cross-section and Core
34

625

Type. The latter variable was included in this analysis since the types used in this study were

626

mostly defined by morphological criteria (e.g., pyramidal).

627

The first and second dimensions of the MCA explain c. 47% of the overall variability (Figure 13).

628

Positive loadings in Dimension 1 (29.4%) are related to the presence of flat cores, with irregular

629

cross-section morphologies and random organization of removals. Regarding the negative

630

loadings, Dimension 1 is mostly marked by elongated, prismatic cores, most of the times

631

presenting triangular cross-sections. The ANOVA comparison results suggest no statistically

632

significant difference across most of the assemblages, with all sites presenting a high degree of

633

variability, as shown by the large confidence intervals shown in Figure 14. Still, the presence of

634

prismatic cores seems to be under-represented at the two latest VB levels, VALM and the oldest

635

level of PAP.

636

Although representing 17.6% of the variability, Dimension 2 is much less informative than

637

Dimension 1. The positive loadings in Dimension 2 are associated with the occurrence of circular

638

or other types of core cross-sections. Only the PAP 4’75-5’25 and AMB IV assemblages show a

639

rather weak association with this specific pattern. All the remaining contexts are indifferentiable

640

in this dimension from a statistical point of view.

Core Use

651

The analysis of core use aimed to understand how knappers reduced cores using different

652

techniques to manage convexities and shape cores. Platform treatment, the number, and

653

relationship between platforms, and the type of blanks extracted were used for this analysis.

654

Categorized versions of core weight and elongation were also included to understand how

655

technological variables covary with changes in these two metrics. It is noteworthy, however, that

656

this approach is less powerful than the core exploitation using blanks presented above since the

657

observed patterns are coming from a single moment of core reduction when this was abandoned

658

for some reason.

659

The total variability calculated by the two first dimensions of the MCA is around 34% (Figure 15).

660

Dimension 1 (22.1%) is marked by a significant dichotomy between, on the one hand (positive

661

loadings), heavy cores used for the production of flakes, using 2 isolated or multiple platforms,

662

and, on the other hand (negative loadings), highly elongated cores used to extract elongated blanks,

663

using faceted platforms and opposed bidirectional strategies. The plot of trimmed mean values and

664

confidence intervals for each context in Dimension 1 (Figure 16) reveals that the averages of the

665

two latest contexts of AMB and PAP are the ones contributing the most to the negative loadings.

666

On the contrary, VB, VALM and the oldest assemblages of PAP and AMB seem to have reduced

667

frequencies of the component associated with highly elongated blanks and prepared platforms.

668

These results confirm the patterns observed for the platform maintenance and core exploitation

669

using blanks domains presented above, with a well-demarcated chronological division for the latest

670

LGM occupations at PAP and AMB.

37

671

In the case of Dimension 2 (12.3%), as in the core morphology analysis, only the positive loadings

672

of the MCA calculation seem to make a relevant contribution to the analysis. These are mostly

673

marked by the occurrence of cores with more than two platforms used for the extraction of mixed

674

products, with no significant correlation showing up between these cores and values for weight

675

and elongation. As expected, the distribution of contexts across this dimension does not seem to

676

reveal any statistically significant differences, suggesting that this technological component occurs

677

equally represented across all sites.

Discussion and conclusion

687

The analyses presented above aimed to provide a first evaluation of lithic technological variability

688

during the LGM in southern Iberia. Specifically, this study was directed to assess the levels of

689

similarity and difference within and between sites, to better understand the organization of

690

technology in a geographically well-defined cultural entity, in which long-distance contacts and

691

social networks seem to have played a structuring role. The significant variability displayed by the

692

various tests is notable, and particularly evident in the small amount of variation explained by the

693

different MCAs. Nevertheless, preliminary conclusions can be drawn using some of the detected

694

patterns across both time and space. Most of these patterns are better seen in Figure 17, which

695

compiles the overall results of the application of bootstraped ANOVA tests to the mean loadings

696

of each context within the MCAs shown above.

701
702

In the first instance, chronological change in the technological options of lithic production is

703

attested by significant dissimilarities between some contexts within multi-layered sites. This

704

pattern is mostly visible in the particularities of platform maintenance and core exploitation

705

domains. However, this seems to have only occurred at AMB and PAP. At AMB, two general

706

technological phases can be distinguished, with results differentiating between the oldest contexts

707

(AMB VI and AMB IV) and the more recent level (AMB II). At PAP, the separation also occurs

708

in the transition between the two oldest levels (PAP 5’25-6’25 and PAP 4’75-5’25) and the most

709

recent one (PAP 4’00-4’75). These disruptions are, at both sites, coincident with the transition

710

from the traditionally-defined Upper Solutrean to Solutreo-Gravettian (or Evolved Upper

711

Solutrean) phases, which is thought to have occurred, at these sites, at around c. 20.5 ka cal BP
40

712

[43,53,115]. Thus, previous differences detected between those phases, based on typological

713

grounds and pointing to a decline in the use of flat-retouched points and the increasing presence

714

of backed shouldered points [23,116], seem to be corroborated by significant changes in the

715

technological substrate. The most important changes regarding this transition comprise an

716

increasing use of reduction sequences oriented to the production of highly elongated blanks, using

717

opposed bidirectional methods on prismatically-organized cores. The absence of this tendency at

718

VB [27,45] might result from a lack of effective occupation at the site during the later parts of the

719

LGM [45,47], but also by technological drift occuring during this period across Iberia, as suggested

720

by the fact that a Solutreo-Gravettian phase was, so far, not clearly recognized in the Atlantic

721

facade of Iberia.

722

The distribution of non-significantly different statistical results in Figure 17 reveals also that the

723

degree of similarity between the earliest occupations of the spanish sites and VB is rather high.

724

Particularly, lower blank elongation and simple unidirectional reduction strategies seem to explain

725

the proximity between all levels of VB and the two oldest contexts of PAP and AMB (similar in

726

between c. 75% and c. 60% of the tests, respectively).

727

According to the traditional chronological organization of the Solutrean, differences in the extent

728

of social networks in southern and western Iberia may have separated early from later phases of

729

the technocomplex. Zilhão [21], for example, suggests a correlation between global environmental

730

constraints and point types distributions, with epochs of regional convergence broadly coinciding

731

with periods of colder climate (i.e., the Middle Solutrean), and epochs of regional divergence

732

broadly coinciding with periods of more temperate climate (i.e., Upper Solutrean). This

733

relationship can be only explained by fluctuations in size, extension and shape of social networks,

734

with more rigorous environments motivating the existence of long-distance circulation of
41

735

individuals, objects and ideas, and warmer climates being responsible for decreasing the frequency

736

and intensity of long-distance contacts and favouring cultural drift [25]. Although the results of

737

this study seem to agree with these ideas, they also become problematic when looking at the

738

chronologies and types of lithic projectiles associated with each context. In fact, under the

739

traditional scheme, all three levels of VB are considered Upper Solutrean but appear here

740

correlated with contexts classified as Middle Solutrean (PAP 5’25-6’25 and AMB VI) [43]. Thus,

741

technological convergence cannot be explained by the traditional phased model based on points

742

typology, but only by the association between the two assemblages in terms of absolute chronology

743

[45]. This, in turn, may have implications for the functional organization of settlement within the

744

Mediterranean region that require further dedicated studies to be ascertained conclusively. What

745

seems relevant is that these results open the possibility for the existence of technological

746

convergence across southern Iberia, with contact occuring in a way that enabled sharing of the

747

complete technological solutions. Further evidence for this contacts is provided by the similiarities

748

present in other aspects of the archaeological record, such as the style of the animal representations

749

in an engraved slab from VB C and the Middle Solutrean portable art elements in PAP [39,40].

750

Another relevant, general, trend is the progressive reduction of platform facetting over time at

751

AMB and PAP, even though, with exception of VALM, assemblages present reduced frequencies

752

of platform preparation. Still, although bifacial thinning flakes have been removed from the

753

analysis, the lower percentages of faceted platforms in latest assemblages at AMB and PAP is

754

probably also indicative of a gradual reduction in the importance of bifacial debitage over time

755

[94,117], since the recurrent use of small-scale flaking of striking surfaces to support “on-the-

756

edge” marginal percussion) is typically associated with bifacial knapping strategies [118]. On the

757

other hand, platform preparation through facetting has been shown to relate with a purposeful
42

758

alteration of exterior platform angles in other type of reduction schemes, to control the size and

759

shape of the extracted blanks. One cannot exclude thus that, in some of the studied assemblages,

760

platform facetting was used to control blanks’ morphometrics. At VALM, the largest frequency of

761

platform facetting preferentially associated with the production of elongated blanks seems to

762

corroborate this interpretation. Thus, the lower frequencies of platform facetting in the remaining

763

assemblages on the one hand, and their significantly high presence at other Solutrean sites in the

764

portuguese Estremadura [24] on the other hand, seems to indicate the existence of particular

765

technological solutions in central Portugal that might imply lower degrees of technological

766

knowledge sharing with the southernmost regions of Iberia. Although some aspects of the

767

singularity of VALM might originate from a biased collection of the materials during the

768

excavation, already mentioned by Zilhão [24], or even from possible differences arising from the

769

single-horizon open-air nature of VALM contra the palimpsest-derived assemblages of the

770

remaining sites, the technological dissimilarities detected in this study seem to corroborate the

771

isolation of central Portugal as an independent techno-cultural unit.

772

The Atlantic vs Mediterranean division is also noteworthy in the overall higher degree of similarity

773

between the two spanish sites, than between those sites and the portuguese assemblages. In the

774

context of the cultural transmission assumptions used in this study, it is tempting to argue that this

775

pattern might be related with a distance factor, in which geographically closer assemblages tend

776

to present a higher degree of technological similarity. A distance decay factor, in which the

777

similiatiry of cultural traits is expected to decline over distance and that some degree of spatial

778

autocorrelation should exist, is, in fact, one of the major assumptions in archaeological cultural

779

transmission processes literature [80,82,119,120]. Accepting this interpretation would suggest the

780

existence of marked technological differences between what is traditionally defined as the
43

781

Mediterranean and the Portuguese Solutrean facies, somehow confirming the typologically-based

782

interpretations.

783

Finally, it is also noteworthy that, despite the similiarites in some technological aspects, all VB

784

contexts appear isolated. In previous studies, technological idiosyncrasies of VB have been noted

785

and are not exclusive for LGM occupations [121]. Possible explanations are related with the low

786

knapping quality of chert, featuring small nodules and volumes highly fractured by tectonics [122],

787

available within the VB raw materials acquisition territory. This most likely led hunter-gatherers

788

to develop specific technological strategies fitted to the characteristics of the raw materials [123].

789

To some degree, VB technological options are stable across the site’s sequence, and independent

790

of changes introduced in tools shape at the beginning of each Upper Paleolithic techno-complex

791

[124]. In the particular case of the Solutrean and the hypotheses raised by this study, technological

792

practices transmission might have occurred in contexts of a high degree of social intimacy, but

793

ecological regional constraints did not allow the generalization of basic technological patterns.

794

As in any other geographies and timeframes, technological variation over the LGM in southern

795

Iberia was the result of a complex relationship among patterns of inheritance, interaction, and

796

regional adaptation. Population interaction across larger territories was certainly a key factor of

797

the adaptive response to the impact of climate and landscape modifications and seem to have

798

functioned through sharing behaviors of stylistic/typological concepts, but also of technological

799

solutions. Concept sharing could have occurred across regions in different acculturation

800

environments, depending on the geographical distance between communities and preferential

801

cultural ties, but also on the impact that local resources could have had in the technological

802

decisions. After all, humans, as other biota, interact with the environment at distinct scales and

803

create self-reinforcing adaptive patterns [124]. The multiple but distinct scales of self-organization
44

804

during the LGM in southern Iberia, and the distribution of behaviors within and across scales might

805

have been one of the most important generators of resilience for those communities [125].

806

Only further studies using more data from the regions addressed in this study, and other territories

807

located between them (e.g., Alentejo, southwestern Spain), will allow the ascertainment of the

808

extension of the several scales of influence and contacts.
