Abstract: Cultural schemas inform people’s perceptions of the hierarchical order of
nations, which in turn can perpetuate the power of cultural schemas. We theorise that
longstanding, western-centric schemas of development and cultural wealth are tightly
linked to people’s perceptions of national hierarchy. We examine European publics’
evaluations of their own and other European countries across many attributes using
data from the Nation Brands Index surveys. We find that European publics rank
northwest European countries highest on developmental attributes and southwestern
European nations highest on attributes of cultural wealth, while they rank eastern
European countries lowest in both categorisations. Moreover, we show that publics’
rankings of countries load to two related but distinct factors, the contents of which
closely reflect schemas of development and cultural wealth. This evidence suggests
that these two distinct schemas are simultaneously present in Europeans’ perceptions
of national hierarchy.

INTRODUCTION
People’s perceptions about the relative status position of countries are rooted in
evaluations of the quality, value and desirability of countries in relation to one another.
Such perceptions of national hierarchy constitute a set of status beliefs or assumptions
that associate more or less esteem and competence to some social groups and less to
others (Ridgeway et al. 2009). They shape how individuals, organisations and nationstates imagine themselves and others (Alasuutari and Qadir 2016; Buchanan and
Cantril 1953). Even when perceptions of national hierarchy match some observable
differences in material indicators, such as gross domestic product per capita, they are
nevertheless powerful and influential in their own right. Perceptions, rankings, and
evaluations can shape behaviour both when they are accurate and inaccurate (Davis et
al. 2012; Espeland and Sauder 2007; Frye 2017; Kelley 2017; Merry 2016). For
example, perceptions of countries quietly inform which countries receive loans from
intergovernmental organisations like the International Monetary Fund or World Bank
(Babb 2009). These perceptions may motivate geopolitical military activity among
countries that have interest in boosting their status position (Melegh 2006) and they
may also stimulate nation-branding campaigns aimed at improving a country’s image
and reputation (Rivera 2008).
Because of their underlying importance in motivating many decisions net of their
empirical accuracy, we seek to understand, measure and describe publics’ perceptions
of national hierarchy. Current scholarship theorises that dominant cultural schemas
about what makes up societal “development” and which societies are theorised as being
more or less developed inform publics’ perceptions of national hierarchy (e.g. Thornton

2

et al. 2012). We theorise that another set of schemas about cultural wealth forms the
basis of a distinct perceived hierarchical organisation of nations. In doing so, we follow
other scholars in arguing that cultural wealth is a form of symbolic capital that countries
can convert into other forms of capital that produce economic benefits (Bandelj and
Wherry 2011; Elliott and Schmutz 2016; Rivera 2008; Schmutz and Elliott 2017). In this
view, countries leverage their technological advancement, economic wealth, stocks of
education and their distinctive cultural resources as they market themselves abroad or
justify their inclusion in international communities such as the European Union.
We focus our analysis on Europeans’ perceptions of national hierarchy given its
long-standing efforts at regional integration. Scholars trace the invention of a perceived
European hierarchy of nations to the rise of enlightenment philosophy and the eastward
expansion of Europe’s boundaries (Melegh 2006; Neumann 1999; Wolff 1994). They
explain that European publics think of a regional (intra-European) hierarchy of nations
that favours western and northern countries and disfavours eastern and southern ones.
Some scholars examining contemporary quantitative measures of public opinion find
evidence of a single east-to-west slope of perceived levels of national development
(Kiss 2017; Melegh et al. 2013; 2016).
We advance this literature by assessing publics’ perceptions of nations across
many different dimensions and attributes. This allows us to consider the possibility of
“heterarchy” (Lamont 2012), that is, simultaneously existing yet independent national
hierarchies based on unique cultural schemas. We leverage data collected from
national samples in eight European countries in which respondents evaluated 23
European countries, including their own, on a large number of attributes across multiple

3

dimensions of the nation-state. Do European publics express similar or varied
perceptions about national hierarchy? How are their views consistent or dissimilar
across different dimensions of the nation-state? Are their evaluations of nation-states
tied to a single, latent schema of national hierarchy or are multiple, distinct schemas of
national hierarchy apparent in their evaluations?

BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE
Schemas of “Development” and Perceptions of National Hierarchy
Cultural schemas can take myriad forms, but research on perceptions of national
hierarchy has primarily focused on the importance of globally pervasive schemas of
national development, which many scholars describe as being part of developmental
idealism (Thornton 2005; Thornton et al. 2015). Like other ideologies, developmental
idealism is comprised of various schemas about what constitutes a “developed” country,
as well as the causes and consequences of “development.” These schemas can be
traced to longstanding theories of universal development that scholars and
policymakers have advanced for centuries, which posit that a basket of attributes is
necessary for a country to progress to a higher level of national development (Nisbet
1969; Thornton 2005). In these schemas, desirable attributes include open and
democratic governance, capitalist economic institutions, science and technology, a
modern demographic regime, personal freedoms, human rights protections and gender
equality, to name a few (Meyer et al. 1997). Scientists, policymakers, civil society
organisations and governments have broadly disseminated ideas about the attributes of
the “ideal” nation and prescriptions for how countries labelled as “less developed” can

4

progress toward “modernity” (Alasuutari and Qadir 2016; Towns and Rumelili 2017).
They have diffused their ideas to ordinary publics through a variety of means, including
public education, museums and cultural exhibits, magazines and books, international
organisations and national marketing campaigns (Boli and Thomas 1999; Lerch et al.
2017; Thornton et al. 2015).
Among Europeans, perceptions of a developmental hierarchy of nations traces to
widely disseminated historical narratives of a north-to-south gradient of societal
advancement, with the origin of “civilisation” imagined as beginning from the seat of first
Greek and later, Roman, civilisation in southern Europe (Antohi 2000). With the
economic, military and technological ascendency of western European countries
beginning in the 17th century, the perception of a north-to-south civilisation slope was
gradually replaced by a perceived east-to-west developmental spectrum that closely
tracks to the invention of “Eastern Europe” (Melegh 2006; Wolff 1994). Many other
perceived cultural distinctions reinforced belief in an east-to-west gradient of nations,
including an ethno-linguistic divide between Germanic and Slavic peoples, a religious
divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy (and further still between
Christianity and Islam), and more recent economic and political divides that imagine a
democratic-capitalist west and communist east (Neumann 1999; Schimmelfennig 2001).
One piece of evidence for the longstanding prevalence of such hierarchical views
of different European nations is the use of categorical language to classify societies and
places, such as the historically common labels of “savage” versus “civilised” peoples or
“primitive” versus “modern” nations (Swindle 2019). In certain periods of Europe,
pejorative adjectives like “barbaric,” “heathen” or “backward” have been ascribed to

5

Slavic nations, places that fell outside of the Roman Empire and also to Eastern
Orthodox religious adherents (Melegh 2006; Thornton et al. 2015:299-301; Wolff 2004).
This classification practice continues to be widespread today, although generally with
different adjectives (e.g. “less developed” versus “developed”).
Motivated by this body of research on the perceived developmental hierarchy of
nations, Thornton et al. (2012) tested the prominence of such perceptions at the
population level among lay publics using surveys fielded in a number of countries
spanning all major world regions, including Albania, Argentina, Bulgaria, China, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Malawi, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the United States.
Respondents rated countries by perceived level of “development.” From the
accumulated country ratings, Thornton et al. (2012) constructed publically perceived
developmental hierarchies of nations—one hierarchy for each measured public—and
compared them to one another. Cross-country comparisons showed that respondents
from different countries produced similar developmental hierarchies. Within-country
comparisons of developmental hierarchies by various social groups (e.g. education,
age, or gender) also found little variation in the rank ordering of countries on
development (Binstock et al. 2013). Results from additional surveys fielded in other
countries, including several European nations, have produced consistent results and
find a clear east-to-west European slope of perceived levels of national development in
line with prior historical analyses (Kiss 2017; Melegh et al. 2013; 2016; see also Lai and
Mu 2016; Thornton and Yang 2016). Furthermore, perceived global developmental
hierarchies were strongly correlated with the rank ordering of countries on the United
Nations Human Development Index and gross domestic product per capita. They

6

recognise that some people are aware of the “objective” material realities of various
countries and can correctly match their own rankings of countries to nations’ metrics.
However, they note that global indices of national development and national culture are
themselves social constructs that perpetuate the world they seek to objectively measure
(Davis et al. 2012; Kelley 2017; Merry 2016; Wherry 2004).
Multidimensional Perceptions of National Hierarchy and Schemas of “Cultural Wealth”
Despite the empirical consistency in scholarship about the prevalence of
developmental idealism, there is a theoretical tradition of multidimensionality in
conceptions of the nation-state (e.g. Smith 2008). In addition, research on “nation
branding” posits that the concept of the nation-state is multidimensional and comprised
of a country’s people, government, economy, cultural goods and natural environment
(e.g. Anholt 2007; 2010; Buhmann 2016). In this conceptualization, a country’s
economy may be viewed favourably while its governance structure is simultaneously
viewed negatively. Likewise, a country may be perceived as having an abundance of
natural amenities, but lacking in prestigious cultural heritage. This type of dimensionality
cannot be not captured on surveys that ask respondents to rate countries according to
their level of “development.”
One of the few studies that has examined Europeans’ perceptions of national
hierarchy across multiple dimensions (as opposed to the use of a single omnibus
variable such as perceived “development”) found that Europeans’ perceptions reflect an
east-to-west slope with little variation by dimension (Delhey and Kohler 2006). The
dimensions of the nation-state they examined (economy, employment, environment,
social welfare and quality of life) did not include the elements of cultural wealth that we

7

describe below and which we believe may diverge from developmental conceptions of
the nation-state. Even where prior scholarship has considered the importance of
nations’ cultural attributes on perceptions of national hierarchy, it has tended to be more
concerned with cultural compatibility in language or religion, rather than perceived
differences in the cultural wealth of nations (Delhey 2007; Deutschmann et al. 2018).
The edited volume The Cultural Wealth of Nations (Bandelj and Wherry 2011)
documents how nations engage in the cultivation and branding of their societies for
economic growth, from the cultivation of the Mundo Maya in Central America to the
expansion of the Thai silk industry. Scholarship in this paradigm defines cultural wealth
as “the value added derived from the intangible qualities of products and services
emanating in part from the perceived cultural heritage of the people engaged in their
production” (Bandelj and Wherry 2011:26). Countries with widely known and
successfully branded cultural heritage may be perceived as less risky places to visit or
invest. Such distinctions have motivated national marketing campaigns to leverage the
particularistic elements of perceived national culture and heritage (Napolitano and De
Nisco 2017).
Increasingly, the marketing of a nation’s unique cultural and natural assets is
understood to be essential for differentiating one’s own country from its “competitors.”
The importance of UNESCO world heritage site designations for international tourism
and global legitimacy represent one way that nations may display and promote their
cultural wealth, heritage and peculiarity while conforming to universal standards (Elliott
and Schmutz 2016; Reyes 2014; Schmutz and Elliott 2017). Other examples include the
marketing of a nation’s distinct cuisine, fashion, music and art (Surak 2011). Countries

8

with a history of conquest, border expansion and enlarged regional influence have
enjoyed a greater degree of cultural wealth. They are better known among lay people
and they often enjoy greater international legitimacy. In Europe, the cultural wealth of
former empires such as France, Germany, Spain and the UK is widely apparent, leading
eastern European nations to embark on their own nation branding campaigns aimed at
emphasizing their unique cultural heritages (Ociepka 2018; Rivera 2008).
The underlying presence of these two schemas—development and cultural
wealth—resembles social psychology theories of out-group stereotyping (Fiske et al.
2002). According to this literature, the primary basis for stereotypes is competence and
warmth. Though these categories are distinct, they overlap in some ways with schemas
of development and cultural wealth. Competence is often about a social group’s
perceived ability, achievement and, in a word, “development.” Warmth reflects the
perceived affective characteristics of a social group, such as its respectability and
heritage, which are core components for the creation of cultural wealth.
The literatures we have reviewed lead us to expect broad cross-national
agreement in a developmental hierarchy of nations that is primarily based on the kinds
of economic, political and social characteristics that feature prominently in schemas of
developmental idealism. At the same time, we hypothesise the existence of a distinct
hierarchy of nations based on schemas of cultural wealth. We also expect that publics’
orderings of nations along developmental and cultural factors correlate with indices of
“national development” and “national culture,” respectively.
Scholarship on perceptions of national hierarchy has also identified some
evidence of self-bias among publics. Melegh et al. (2013; 2016) found that respondents

9

in Bulgaria and Albania saw their own countries as less developed than did respondents
from other countries (see also Todorova 1997). Yet, Dorius (2016) and Lai and Mu
(2016) found that self-evaluations of national development by Chinese citizens were
higher than evaluations of China by respondents from other countries and studies on
transnational perceptions of trust and attachment across European nations find similar
evidence of positive self-bias (Delhey 2007; Deutschmann et al. 2018; Hagendoorn
1993). Given these conflicting observations, we examine whether Europeans tend to
over-rate or under-rate their own country compared to how other European publics rate
them, but we do not formulate an empirical hypothesis.

DATA AND METHODS
We conducted a data search to locate cross-national data that would allow us to
test our assertions about the dimensionality of public perceptions of national hierarchy
in Europe. This would contrast our findings with those based on surveys with an
omnibus question about countries' level of “development,” as in Thornton et al. (2012)
and other studies.
Our data search identified national-level aggregated data from the Nation Brands
Index surveys as containing many measures of Europeans’ perceptions of different
countries (Anholt and GfK 2015). The Nation Brands Index (NBI) surveys were originally
designed in 2005 by Simon Anholt, a founding pioneer of place branding marketing and
research (Anholt 2005; Roper 2008). Partnering with the widely used survey company
GfK, online surveys were administered in 2008 and 2009 to approximately 1,000
respondents in each of 20 countries, amassing over 40,000 completed questionnaires.

10

Samples were weighted to reflect the national-level demographic characteristics of each
surveyed country, matching recommendations in survey methodology literature about
internet-based non-probability samples (Baker et al. 2013). Respondents eighteen and
older completed an ex-post standardised survey containing identical questions and
response categories in which they evaluated 50 countries on a large number of
attributes related to different theorised dimensions of the nation-state that NBI
administrators summarised from literature on the historical construction of nation-states
and contemporary nation branding efforts (e.g. Anholt 2007; 2010; Buhmann 2016;
Smith 2008). The dimensions of the nation-state in which NBI administrators grouped
survey questions were: Governance, Immigration and Investment, People, Products,
Tourism and Culture.
In official reports and press releases, NBI administrators presented national-level
aggregated index scores from each surveyed public ranging from 1-50 for each country
on each of the six indices (Anholt and GfK 2015). In other words, each country received
six scores from people in each of the different surveyed nations. To calculate these
scores, NBI administrators first took the average of the scores across all survey
questions comprising each of the six indices that a given respondent from a country
assigned to another country. Then they replaced these average scores with rankings
from 1-50 depending on the relative position of each country’s average score in
comparison to the average scores of all other countries. Finally, NBI administrators
aggregated the data to the national-level, such that the final data reported how people
on average from each surveyed country ranked each of the 50 countries across each of
the six dimensions.

11

Among the 20 publics surveyed in the NBI, eight were from Europe, and among
the 52 countries that publics ranked in either 2008 or 2009, 23 were from Europe.
Owing to our interest in regional, intra-European hierarchies, we restricted our analysis
to data collected in the eight European countries—France, Germany, Italy, Poland,
Russia, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom (UK)—about their perceptions of the
23 European countries, as listed in Table 1. We note that four of these countries are in
north and west Europe and the other four are in south and east European. Our dataset
therefore included just over 2200 country rankings (8 surveyed publics * 23 rated
countries * 6 indices * 2 waves) organised into 96 national hierarchies: one hierarchy
per index, year and surveyed public.1 We reverse scaled the country rankings so 50
identified the first ranked country.

Notes: Norway and Iceland were only rated in 2008. Germany did not rate the Netherlands in 2009.
Scotland excluded from the present analysis due to lack of data on external criterion.
The individual-level data collected from these surveys are not publically
available, but the aggregated, national-level data are widely used in the growing
literature on “nation branding” in international business research, alongside other similar
country image indices (e.g. Kalamova and Konrad 2010; Kemming and Humborg 2010;

Except Iceland and Norway, which were not evaluated in 2009, and the Netherlands, which was not
evaluated by German respondents in 2009.

Mariutti and Tench 2016; see also Buhmann 2016:29-35; Merkelsen and Rasmussen
2019:69-76). Though these data may not be familiar to sociologists, the national-level
NBI data are similar to other national-level aggregated data compiled from crossnational individual-level surveys that social science researchers use, such as PEW
global surveys.
Our interest in the NBI data is that they permit us to examine publics’ perceptions
of nations across a large number of attributes, far more so than any other cross-national
survey. The full set of questions used in the NBI surveys is given in Table 2. Most
questions relied on seven-point Likert scales in which one indicated strong
disagreement and seven indicated strong agreement. A small number of questions
presented respondents with a list of word associations and asked them to select one
that most represented a country.

Likert-scaled questions comprising the Governance, Immigration and Investment
and Products dimensions showed strong overlap with international development
discourse found in academic literature, public policy documents and historical writings.
For example, questions asked respondents if each country was respectful of human
rights, a place they would like to work and a producer of science and technology (Drori
et al. 2002; Thornton et al. 2017). Questions listed under the People dimension were
similar but less clearly tied to developmental schemas, asking respondents to evaluate
people from each country as hosts, friends and employees. These four dimensions also
included many unique word associations for terms extensively used in academic writing

14

and lay discourse about world development, such as corrupt, dangerous, transparent,
backward, developing and modern (Dorius and Swindle forthcoming; Swindle 2019). In
the questions categorised in the final two dimensions, Tourism and Culture,
respondents were asked to consider each country’s buildings and monuments, music,
films, literature, sports, urban attractions and design, among other things, all of which
are discussed in the literature as symbolic resources of cultural wealth (Bandelj and
Wherry 2011). As seen in Figure 1, the distribution of country rankings on each index
was modestly left-skewed, reflecting that views of European countries is generally more
favourably than views of the non-European countries rated in the NBI surveys. The
average correlation between the 2008 and 2009 country rankings was 0.97 across
publics and indices, indicating that European publics held remarkably stable views
about the attributes of their regional neighbours. All correlations were greater than 0.93
except for Turkey, which evinced greater variation on the People index.2

2

Turkish public opinion of France, Lithuania, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Ireland, and Romania on the
People index experienced substantial absolute change from 2008 to 2009 (deviations in rank of 30, 15,
13, 9, 7, 7, and 7, respectively). To put Turkish deviations into perspective, the average deviation in 2008
and 2009 country rankings on the People index was 1.42.

We also compared the NBI data to four external criterion variables: two to
compare against schemas of development and two to compare against schemas of
cultural wealth. We report in Table 3 the descriptive statistics for these four variables.

Our first interest was to assess the level of similarity between how publics’
ranked countries in the NBI surveys and how publics rated countries on “development,”

16

as measured in nationally representative sample surveys fielded between 2005 and
2014 in four European countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania
(Kiss 2017; Melegh et al. 2013; 2016; Thornton et al. 2012). For simplicity, we refer to
the data acquired from these surveys as “Developmental Idealism (DI) data,” or “DI
data” for short, because the intention of these studies was to measure people’s views of
national hierarchy based on schemas of developmental idealism. Respondents in the DI
data rated countries on development using a 0-10 scale, with higher values indicating
higher levels of development. Respondents were not given a definition of “development”
to ensure that they rated countries according to their own understanding of the concept
(Thornton et al. 2012).3 Fifteen European countries were rated in both the NBI and DI
data, including Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Spain, Italy,
Denmark, Norway, France, Austria, Sweden, the UK, Germany and Switzerland.
The second external criterion measure we employ is the 2000 Human
Development Index (United Nations 2017) based on country estimates of logged gross
domestic product, literacy, gross school enrolment and life expectancy at birth. This
measure is of interest given prior scholarship findings of a high correlation between DI
data and the Human Development Index. The third is the logged total number of United
Nations world heritage cultural sites in each country (UNESCO 2017), which prior
scholarship states that a country can demonstrate its cultural wealth by receiving world
heritage recognition of specific in-country destinations (Bandelj and Wherry 2004). The
fourth variable is the logged total tourist arrivals to each country in 2000 (World Bank
2017), evidence of successful nation branding and global desirability as a tourist

destination (Rivera 2008). The Czech Republic and Hungary were missing tourism data,
so we excluded them from our analyses using this measure.
Our analysis begins with summary data on country rankings for each of the six
indices that constitute the NBI data. We then used exploratory and confirmatory factor
models to assess the level of association between country rankings on the six indices
and we evaluated the validity of the extracted factors using external criterion measures.
From here, we extracted factor scores so that we could consider the geography of
perceived European hierarchy. In the final step, we investigated how European publics
rated themselves relative to how people in other European countries rated them.

RESULTS
Descriptive Analysis
Country rankings on the six indices are reported in columns 1-6 of Table 4, each
of which are averaged over the 2008 and 2009 data collections to simplify presentation
of the data and to ensure we retain those countries ranked only in 2008 or 2009. We
also report each country’s average rank across the six indices (column 7) and country
specific deviations over the indices (column 8). The latter column can be interpreted as
a measure of agreement among the several publics concerning the ranked attributes of
each country listed in Table 4. A small deviation score indicates high inter-country
consensus about a country and a large deviation indicates the opposite. Countries are
sorted from the most to least favourable average ranking across the six indices.

As measured by average country ranking, European publics placed Germany at
the top of the regional hierarchy of nations, followed by Sweden and France. The top
ranked countries for each index were: Sweden for Governance and People, Switzerland
for Immigration & Investment, Germany for Products, France for Culture and Italy for
Tourism. Romania was the lowest ranked country overall, followed by Lithuania, and
Estonia. Each of the bottom ranked countries is located in what has historically been
referred to as eastern Europe, while all the top ranked countries are located in western
Europe. These data provided further evidence of an entrenched and durable east-towest perceptual slope of societal hierarchy among European publics.
The average standard deviation (SD) was 7, which suggests that Europeans in
different countries relied on common evaluative criteria when ranking their continental
peers. Austria received the most consistent ranking (SD=4.1), followed by Hungary
(SD=4.5). The least consistent rankings were given to Russia (SD=13.9), which had a
high average ranking of 44.5 on Culture, but the lowest average ranking of all ranked
European countries on Governance at 11.1. We observed several other notable
inconsistencies in countries’ rankings across indices that indicated a possible bifurcation
in Europeans’ perceptions in terms of national development and cultural wealth. Spain
and Italy received above average rankings on the attributes comprising the Tourism and
Culture indices, but below average rankings on the Governance index. Conversely,
Nordic countries tended to rank high on all but the Tourism and Culture indices.
Factor Analysis
We next considered the latent structure of the NBI country rankings through
factor analysis. High loadings to a single factor would infer that there is a uniform and

20

singular way of perceiving national hierarchy in Europe. Put another way, a single factor
would indicate that respondents’ evaluations of countries on all six NBI indices are tied
to a single, common cultural schema. If country specific cultural schemas are manifest
in publics’ beliefs about national hierarchy, factor analysis should identify eight factors,
one for each surveyed public. If public perceptions transcended national boundaries but
very by national attributes, we should observe six factors, one for each index. We
excluded publics’ self-rankings of their own nation from these analyses given the
literature on self-evaluation bias.
As shown in Table 5, We first estimated eight exploratory factor models—one for
each surveyed public—to measure the interrelationship between country rankings on
the six indices within measured publics. These models, which we estimated on
Kendall’s (tau) correlation matrices due to the ranked nature of the data, showed that
the six indices evinced similar scale properties within each of the eight measured
publics. According to conventional standards, loadings for each index were either
moderate or strong. Estimation of eight additional country specific factor models that
allowed the six indices to load to more than one factor revealed a two factor model
within each surveyed public. In the two factor models, country rankings on the
Government, Immigration-Investment, People and Products indices loaded to the first
factor and country rankings on the Tourism and Culture indices loaded to the second
factor. Oblique rotation, which assumes the two factors were related, yielded high
correlations between the two factors that ranged from 0.63 (France) to 0.74 (UK). With
few exceptions, country rankings on each index loaded strongly to one or the other
factor. Only the Products index consistently loaded to both factors at levels considered

21

moderate or high. The factor patterns suggest a relatively straightforward interpretation: country rankings on the six
indices are closely related, but load to two distinct dimensions.

Notes: Each column represents a separate factor model in which country rankings for each of the six indices were assumed to measure either a single, underlying latent factor
(top panel) within the measured public, or two latent factors (bottom panel). N=23, except Germany, which did not rate the Netherlands in 2008. Self-rankings are excluded.

A formal test of model fit, estimated from a multi-group confirmatory factor model,
indicated that the two-factor model was a better fit to the data than a single factor model
(see Appendix Table A1). Inspection of model fit statistics (χ2, CFI, TLI and SMRM) for
a scalar invariant measurement model, in which factor loadings and means were
constrained to equality in the eight measured publics, showed that the two factor model
was an appreciably better fit, though slightly below conventional cut-offs (Hu and
Bentler 1999).
We draw two broad conclusions from these analyses. First, the results show that
respondents from eight countries spanning the diversity of European geography and
culture relied on similar cultural schemas that agrees with historical narratives of an
east-to-west civilisation slope. This stands starkly in contrast with the null hypothesis
that each public would have evaluated countries based on their unique histories,
cultures and understandings of their continental peers. Second, these data form two
distinct but related scales. The content of the survey questions on the four indices
comprising the first factor is strongly related to schemas of development. The content of
the survey questions for the indices that load on the second factor relate to schemas of
countries’ distinctive national heritage and cultural wealth. Although the two factors are
correlated, their unique content suggest that Europeans relied on two distinct cultural
schemas when they evaluated countries’ attributes.
To validate our interpretation of the factor model results, we calculated bivariate
correlations between factor scores extracted from the scalar invariant, two-factor model
and four external criterion variables, which are displayed in Table 6. In line with our
expectations, the correlation between the development factor and rankings of countries’

23

perceived levels of development from the DI data was very high (r=0.94). The
development factor was also highly correlated with a country’s HDI score in 2000
(r=0.88). These two criterion variables were also highly correlated with the cultural
wealth factor, though the level of association was lower than what we observed for the
development factor. The cultural wealth factor scores were associated with world
heritage sites (r=0.63) and annual tourist arrivals (r=0.65). Criterion variables for cultural
wealth manifest much lower correlation with the development factor. These results
provide additional support for our proposition that publics hierarchically distinguish
European nations based on schemas of development and cultural wealth.

The Geography of European National Hierarchy
Viewed spatially in Figure 2, Europeans views of national hierarchy manifested a
clear gradient from eastern to western Europe. Publics perceived the countries of north
and west Europe as the most developed countries in the region, and the countries of
south and east Europe as the least developed (Panels A and C). This perceptual line of
demarcation tracks closely to long-standing divisions in Europe. The persistence of this
divide over such a long period of time is a likely reason that perceptions of national
hierarchy in Europe are so broadly shared and entrenched.

There were also several distinctions across perceptions of national hierarchy
based on schemas of cultural wealth (Panels B and D). First, Europeans perceived
some Nordic countries to be of lower cultural status relative to their position in the
developmental schema of national hierarchy. Similarly, European publics ranked
Germany first overall in the NBI data, as previously shown in Table 3, but Panel D of
Figure 2 shows that Germany trailed Italy, France, Spain, the UK and Austria on its
perceived cultural wealth. Italy, which was the ninth ranked country on the development
factor, was the first ranked country on the cultural wealth factor. Russia was viewed as
one of the least developed countries in the region but was evaluated much more
favourably in terms of its cultural attributes. These results further substantiate our
overall finding that Europeans rely on two schemas of national hierarchy.
Average Ranking Versus Self-ranking
Comparing publics’ self-rankings with the average rankings of the other seven
publics identified exceptionally large deviations, as shown in Table 7. With few
exceptions (e.g. publics in the UK and Italy ranked their own governments especially
low), self-evaluations evinced an almost universal positive bias. Publics were especially
likely to over-rank themselves on the People and Culture indices and were least likely to
over-rank themselves on the Governance index. Two eastern European countries,
Russia and Poland, had the lowest self-rankings, but the discrepancy between their
self-rankings and other publics’ rankings of them was greater than all nations except
Turkey. The five north or western European countries all rated themselves among the
top four countries (across the fifty countries they were asked about) in every index
except Government.

CONCLUSION
Our analyses indicate that Europeans’ perceptions of countries in Europe across a range of dimensions fall into two
latent categories, the contents of which are closely related to cultural schemas of “development” and “cultural wealth.”
Taken together with the accumulated literature on a perceived developmental hierarchy of nations in Europe (Kiss 2017;
Melegh et al. 2013; 2016), our findings suggest that developmental and cultural conceptualisations of national hierarchy
are firmly and centrally embedded in the mental maps of most Europeans, so much so as to constitute an implicit
European hierarchy of nations. This is not to say that material factors do not also inform publics’ views of countries, as
they undoubtedly do in many cases. Publics’ perceptions of national hierarchy can be informed by their own observations

27

and from their exposure to cultural schemas of national hierarchy. In addition, publics’
perceptions can themselves become powerful influences.
Our results gathered from Nation Brand Index (NBI) surveys produced country
rankings highly correlated with those found in surveys measuring people’s perceptions
of countries’ level of development. This remarkable given the differences in two survey
programs: the NBI survey questions spanned multiple dimensions of the nation-state
and used distinct data collection methods and samples from surveys analysing people’s
perception of national development using a single omnibus question about how different
“developed” countries are. This finding suggests that schemas of developmental
idealism are a fundamental part of the evaluations of European publics toward their
regional neighbours and that Europeans’ perceptions also likely perpetuate such
schemas.
Our results showing a unique perception of a culturally based national hierarchy,
on the other hand, support literature arguing about the importance of cultural wealth in
nations’ public reputations. While we found that European publics believed northwestern
countries to be the most developed and many southwestern countries to be the most
culturally rich, they viewed eastern countries lowest in both national hierarchies. The
distinction between schemas of national hierarchy based on concepts of development
and culture merits testing in other regions of the world, as historically dominant
European nations are likely especially rich in perceived cultural wealth. Place-branding
efforts by countries in other regions of the world suggest that cultural wealth matters
beyond Europe (Bandelj and Wherry 2011), but other forms of perceived national
hierarchies may be more relevant elsewhere (Lamont 2012).

28

Our findings also imply that countries that can both preserve and successfully
market distinctive elements of their national culture stand to reap a perceptual benefit,
which other scholarship indicates can have meaningful political and economic
consequences (e.g. Babb 2009; Davis et al. 2012; Kelley 2017; Merry 2016). Potential
consequences might be inclusion in the European Union or other international and
regional communities and new avenues for economic growth through increased tourism
or international trade agreements (Melegh 2006; Rivera 2008; Wolff 1994). But
preserving or constructing distinctive elements of perceived national culture requires a
careful balancing act. Countries of central and especially eastern Europe must balance
seeking acceptance into European proper while still being distinctive enough to attract
tourists and foreign direct investment in a global marketplace. A recent Polish marketing
slogan reflects this: “Poland is part of the West and also understands the East” (Olins
2006).
We also demonstrated that European publics ranked their own nation much more
favourably than did their regional neighbours. Further research with wider sampling
across eastern European countries beyond the three large countries we examined is
needed to see if this pattern holds. Also of interest is whether or not positive selfrankings bias is a global phenomenon that extends beyond Europe. These questions
are of foremost importance for literature on nation branding given the widespread
reliance on the NBI data and other similar indices capturing publics’ perceptions of
national hierarchies.
Much has changed in Europe since the NBI surveys we analysed were collected
in 2008 and 2009. However, publically available top ten summary rankings for all NBI

29

surveys fielded annually from 2008 to 2017 indicate that changes in the order of publics’
perceptions of national hierarchy were minimal at least through 2017.4 Of the six
European countries in the top ten rankings, all of which were of northwestern origin,
none experienced a change in rank position in excess of three places over the entire
ten-year period. More recent current events since 2017, such as Brexit, turns to
authoritarianism by Turkish and Russian governments and populist movements across
many countries, may have brought about contemporary changes in perceived
hierarchies. We encourage new data collection and research on Europeans’ and other
publics’ perceptions of countries across multiple dimensions.
