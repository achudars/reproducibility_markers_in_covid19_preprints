The Impact of Default Dependency and
Collateralization on Asset Pricing and Credit
Risk Modeling

Tim Xiao1

ABSTRACT
This article presents a comprehensive framework for valuing financial instruments subject to
credit risk. In particular, we focus on the impact of default dependence on asset pricing, as correlated
default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in financial markets. We analyze how swap rates are
affected by bilateral counterparty credit risk, and how CDS spreads depend on the trilateral credit risk of
the buyer, seller, and reference entity in a contract. Moreover, we study the effect of collateralization on
valuation, since the majority of OTC derivatives are collateralized. The model shows that a fully
collateralized swap is risk-free, whereas a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one.

Key Words: asset pricing; credit risk modeling; unilateral, bilateral, multilateral credit risk;
collateralization; comvariance; comrelation; correlation.

Introduction

A broad range of financial instruments bear credit risk. Credit risk may be unilateral, bilateral, or
multilateral. Some instruments such as, loans, bonds, etc, by nature contain only unilateral credit risk
because only the default risk of one party appears to be relevant, whereas some other instruments, such as,
over the counter (OTC) derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFT), and credit derivatives, bear
bilateral or multilateral credit risk because two or more parties are susceptible to default risk. This paper
mainly discusses bilateral and multilateral credit risk modeling, with a particular focus on default
dependency, as correlated credit risk is one of the greatest threats to global financial markets.
There are two primary types of models that attempt to describe default processes in the literature:
structural models and reduced-form (or intensity) models. Many practitioners in the credit trading arena
have tended to gravitate toward the reduced-from models given their mathematical tractability. They can
be made consistent with the risk-neutral probabilities of default backed out from corporate bond prices or
credit default swap (CDS) spreads/premia.
Central to the reduced-form models is the assumption that multiple defaults are independent
conditional on the state of the economy. In reality, however, the default of one party might affect the
default probabilities of other parties. Collin-Dufresne et al. (2003) and Zhang and Jorion (2007) find that
a major credit event at one firm is associated with significant increases in the credit spreads of other
firms. Giesecke (2004), Das et al. (2006), and Lando and Nielsen (2010) find that a defaulting firm can
weaken the firms in its network of business links. These findings have important implications for the
management of credit risk portfolios, where default relationships need to be explicitly modeled.
The main drawback of the conditionally independent assumption or the reduced-form models is
that the range of default correlations that can be achieved is typically too low when compared with
empirical default correlations (see Das et al. (2007)). The responses to correct this weakness can be
generally classified into two categories: endogenous default relationship approaches and exogenous
default relationship approaches.
1

The endogenous approaches include the contagion (or infectious) models and frailty models. The
frailty models (see Duffie et al. (2009), Koopman et al. (2011), etc) describe default clustering based on
some unobservable explanatory variables. In variations of contagion or infectious type models (see Davis
and Lo (2001), Jarrow and Yu (2001), etc.), the assumption of conditional independence is relaxed and
default intensities are made to depend on default events of other entities. Contagion and frailty models fill
an important gap but at the cost of analytic tractability. They can be especially difficult to implement for
large portfolios.
The exogenous approaches (see Li (2000), Laurent and Gregory (2005), Hull and White (2004),
Brigo et al. (2011), etc) attempt to link marginal default probability distributions to the joint default
probability distribution through some external functions. Due to their simplicity in use, the exogenous
approaches become very popular in practice.
Collateralization is one of the most important and widespread credit risk mitigation techniques
used in derivatives transactions. According the ISDA (2012), 71% of all OTC derivatives transactions are
subject to collateral agreements. The use of collateral in the financial markets has increased sharply over
the past decade, yet the research on collateralized valuation is relatively sparse. Previous studies seem to
turn away from direct and detailed modeling of collateralization (see Fuijii and Takahahsi (2012)). For
example, Johannes and Sundaresan (2007), and Fuijii and Takahahsi (2012) characterize collateralization
via a cost-of-collateral instantaneous rate (or stochastic dividend or convenience yield). Piterbarg (2010)
regards collateral as a regular asset in a portfolio and uses the replication approach to price collateralized
contracts.
This paper presents a new framework for valuing defaultable financial instruments with or
without collateral arrangements. The framework characterizes default dependencies exogenously, and
models collateral processes directly based on the fundamental principals of collateral agreements. Some
well-known risky valuation models in the markets, e.g., the CDS model, the risky interest rate swap (IRS)
model (Duffie and Huang (1996)), can be viewed as special cases of this framework, when the default
dependencies are ignored.
2

IRSs and CDSs are two of the largest segments of the OTC derivatives market, collectively
accounting for around two-thirds of both the notional amount and market value of all outstanding
derivatives. Given this framework, we are able to analyze the value of IRSs with bilateral credit risk and
look at how swap rates are affected by correlated default risk. Our study shows that counterparty default
correlations have a relatively small impact on swap rates. Furthermore, we find that the value of a fully
collateralized IRS is equal to the risk-free value. This conclusion is consistent with the current market
practice in which market participants commonly assume fully collateralized swaps are risk-free.
We also study the value of CDS contracts with trilateral credit risk and assess how spreads
depend on the risk of the buyer, seller, and reference entity in a CDS contract. In general, a CDS contract
is used to transfer the credit risk of a reference entity from one party to another. The risk circularity that
transfers one type of risk (reference credit risk) into another (counterparty credit risk) within the CDS
market is a concern for financial stability. Some people claim that the CDS market has increased financial
contagion or even propose an outright ban on these instruments.
The standard CDS pricing model in the market assumes that there is no counterparty risk.
Although this oversimplified model may be accepted in normal market conditions, its reliability in times
of distress has recently been questioned. In fact, counterparty risk has become one of the most dangerous
threats to the CDS market. For some time now it has been realized that, in order to value a CDS properly,
counterparty effects have to be taken into account (see ECB (2009)).
We bring the concept of comvariance into the area of credit risk modeling to capture the
statistical relationship among three or more random variables. Comvariance was first introduced to
economics by Deardorff (1982), who used this measurement to correlate three factors in international
trading. Furthermore, we define a new statistics, comrelation, as a scaled version of comvariance.
Accounting for default correlations and comrelations becomes important in determining CDS premia,
especially during the credit crisis. Our analysis shows that the effect of default dependencies on CDS
premia from large to small is i) the default correlation between the protection seller and the reference
entity, ii) the default comrelation, iii) the default correlation between the protection buyer and the
3

reference entity, and iv) the default correlation between the protection buyer and the protection seller. In
particular, we find that the default comvariance/comrelation has substantial effects on the asset pricing
and risk management, which have never been documented.
There is a significant increase in the use of collateral for CDS after the recent financial crises.
Many people believe that, if a CDS is fully collateralized, there is no risk of failure to pay. Collateral
posting regimes are originally designed and utilized for bilateral risk products, e.g., IRS, but there are
many reasons to be concerned about the success of collateral posting in offsetting the risk of CDS
contracts. First, the value of CDS contracts tends to move very suddenly with big jumps, whereas the
price movement of IRS contracts is far smoother and less volatile than CDS. Second, CDS spreads can
widen very rapidly. Third, CDS contracts have many more risk factors than IRS contracts. In fact, our
model shows that full collateralization cannot eliminate counterparty risk completely for a CDS.
This article also shows that the pricing process of a defaultable instrument normally has a
backward recursive nature if the payoff can be positive or negative. Accordingly, we propose a backward
induction approach for risky valuation. In contrast to the popular recursive integral solution (see Duffie
and Huang (1996)), our backward induction method significantly simplifies the implementation. One can
make use of the well-established algorithms, such as lattice/tree and regression-based Monte Carlo, to
price a defaultable instrument.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Pricing bilateral defaultable instruments is
elaborated on in Section 2; valuing multilateral defaultable instruments is discussed in Section 3; the
conclusions are presented in Section 4. All proofs and some detailed derivations are contained in the
appendices.

Pricing Financial Instruments Subject to Bilateral Credit Risk

We consider a filtered probability space (  , F , Ft t 0 , P ) satisfying the usual conditions,
where  denotes a sample space, F denotes a  -algebra, P denotes a probability measure, and

Ft t 0 denotes a filtration.
In the reduced-form approach, the stopping (or default) time  i of firm i is modeled as a Cox
arrival process (also known as a doubly stochastic Poisson process) whose first jump occurs at default and
is defined by,



t

 i  inf t :  hi ( s, Z s )ds  H i
0



(1)

where hi (t ) or hi (t , Z t ) denotes the stochastic hazard rate or arrival intensity dependent on an exogenous
common state Z t , and H i is a unit exponential random variable independent of Z t .
Dependence between the default times is only introduced by the dependence of the intensity hi (t )
on a common process Z t . Consequently, conditional on the path of Z t , defaults are independent, which is
the reason why this setup is also often called the conditional independence setup.
It is well-known that the survival probability from time t to s in this framework is defined by
s
pi (t , s) : Pi (  s |   t , Z t )  exp   hi (u )du 
 t

(2a)

The default probability for the period (t, s) in this framework is given by
s

t



(2b)

Three different recovery models exist in the literature. The default payoff is either i) a fraction of
par (Madan and Unal (1998)), ii) a fraction of an equivalent default-free bond (Jarrow and Turnbull
(1995)), or iii) a fraction of market value (Duffie and Singleton (1999)). The whole course of the recovery
proceedings under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency act is a complex process that typically involves
extensive negotiation and litigation. No model can fully capture all aspects of this process so, in practice,
all models involve trade-offs between different perspectives and views. In general, the choice for a certain
recovery assumption is based on the legal structure of an instrument to be priced. For example, the
5

recovery of market value (RMV) assumption is well matched to the legal structure of an IRS contract
where, upon default close-out, valuation will in many circumstances reflect the replacement cost of the
transaction, whereas the best default recovery assumption for a CDS is that the claim made in the event of
the reference default equals a fraction of the face value of the underlying bond.
There is ample evidence that corporate defaults are correlated. The default of a firm’s
counterparty might affect its own default probability. Thus, default correlation/dependence arises due to
the counterparty relations.
Two counterparties are denoted as A and B. The binomial default rule considers only two possible
states: default or survival. Therefore, the default indicator Y j for party j (j=A, B) follows a Bernoulli
distribution, which takes value 1 with default probability q j , and value 0 with survival probability p j ,
i.e., P{Y j  0}  p j and P{Y j  1}  q j . The marginal default distributions can be determined by the
reduced-form models. The joint distributions of a multivariate Bernoulli variable can be easily obtained
via the marginal distributions by introducing extra correlations.
Consider a pair of random variables ( YA , YB ) that has a bivariate Bernoulli distribution. The joint
probability representations are given by

where

p00 : P(Y A  0, YB  0)  p A p B   AB

(3a)

p01 : P(YA  0, YB  1)  p A q B   AB

(3b)

p10 : P(YA  1, YB  0)  q A p B   AB

(3c)

p11 : P(Y A  1, YB  1)  q A q B   AB

(3d)

E (Y j )  q j ,  2j  p j q j , and  AB : E(YA  qA )(YB  qB )   AB A B   AB qA pAqB pB where  AB

denotes the default correlation coefficient, and  AB denotes the default covariance.
A critical ingredient of the pricing of a bilateral defaultable instrument is the default settlement
rules. There are two rules in the market. The one-way payment rule was specified by the early
International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) master agreement. The non-defaulting party is not

6

obligated to compensate the defaulting party if the remaining market value of the instrument is positive
for the defaulting party. The two-way payment rule is based on current ISDA documentation. The nondefaulting party will pay the full market value of the instrument to the defaulting party if the contract has
positive value to the defaulting party.
1.1 Risky valuation without collateralization
Consider a defaultable instrument that promises to pay a X T from party B to party A at maturity
date T, and nothing before date T. The payoff X T may be positive or negative, i.e. the instrument may be
either an asset or a liability to each party. All calculations are from the perspective of party A.
We divide the time period (t, T) into n very small time intervals ( t ) and use the approximation

exp y   1  y provided that y is very small. The survival and the default probabilities for the period (t,

t  t ) are given by
pˆ (t ) : p(t , t  t )  exp  h(t )t   1  h(t )t

(4a)

qˆ (t ) : q(t , t  t )  1  exp  h(t )t   h(t )t

(4b)

Suppose that the value of the instrument at time t  t is V (t  t ) that can be an asset or a
liability. There are a total of four ( 2 2  4 ) possible states shown in Table 1.
The risky value of the instrument at time t is the discounted expectation of all the payoffs and is
given by

In theory, a default may happen at any time, i.e., a risky contract is continuously defaultable. This
Continuous Time Risky Valuation Model is accurate but sometimes complex and expensive. For
simplicity, people sometimes prefer the Discrete Time Risky Valuation Model that assumes that a default
may only happen at some discrete times. A natural selection is to assume that a default may occur only on
the payment dates. Fortunately, the level of accuracy for this discrete approximation is well inside the
typical bid-ask spread for most applications (see O’Kane and Turnbull (2003)). From now on, we will
focus on the discrete setting only, but many of the points we make are equally applicable to the
continuous setting.
If we assume that a default may occur only on the payment date, the risky value of the instrument
in a discrete-time setting is given by

We may think of K (t , T ) as the risk-adjusted discount factor, and k A (t , T ) and k B (t , T ) as the
adjustment factors. Equation (10) tells us that the bilateral risky price of a single-payment instrument can
be expressed as the present value of the payoff discounted by a risk-adjusted discount factor that has a
switching-type dependence on the sign of the payoff.

9

Equation (10) can be easily extended from one-period to multiple-periods. Suppose that a
defaultable instrument has m cash flows. Let the m cash flows be represented as X 1 ,…, X m with payment
dates T1 ,…, Tm . Each cash flow may be positive or negative. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 1: The risky value of the multiple-payment instrument is given by



(11b)

where k A (T j , T j 1 ) and kB (T j ,T j 1) are defined in Equation (10).
Proof: See the Appendix.
From Proposition 1, we can see that the intermediate values are vital to determine the final price.
For a payment interval, the current risky value has a dependence on the future risky value. Only on the
final payment date Tm , the value of the instrument and the maximum amount of information needed to
determine the risk-adjusted discount factor are revealed. This type of problem can be best solved by
working backwards in time, with the later risky value feeding into the earlier ones, so that the process
builds on itself in a recursive fashion, which is referred to as backward induction. The most popular
backward induction valuation algorithms are lattice/tree and regression-based Monte Carlo.
1.2 Risky valuation with collateralization
Collateralization is the most important and widely used technique in practice to mitigate credit
risk. The posting of collateral is regulated by the Credit Support Annex (CSA) that specifies a variety of
terms including the threshold, the independent amount, and the minimum transfer amount (MTA), etc.
The threshold is the unsecured credit exposure that a party is willing to bear. The minimum transfer
amount is the smallest amount of collateral that can be transferred. The independent amount plays the
same role as the initial margin (or haircuts).

10

In a typical collateral procedure, a financial instrument is periodically marked-to-market and the
collateral is adjusted to reflect changes in value. The collateral is called as soon as the mark-to-market
(MTM) value rises above the given collateral threshold, or more precisely, above the threshold amount
plus the minimum transfer amount. Thus, the collateral amount posted at time t is given by
V (t )  H (t )
C (t )  
 0

if V (t )  H (t )

(12)

otherwise

where H (t ) is the collateral threshold. In particular, H (t )  0 corresponds to full-collateralization2; H  0
represents partial/under-collateralization; and H  0 is associated with over-collateralization. Full
collateralization becomes increasingly popular at the transaction level. In this paper, we focus on full
collateralization only, i.e., C (t )  V (t ) .
The main role of collateral should be viewed as an improved recovery in the event of a
counterparty default. According to Bankruptcy law, if there has been no default, the collateral is returned
to the collateral giver by the collateral taker. If a default occurs, the collateral taker possesses the
collateral. In other words, collateral does not affect the survival payment; instead, it takes effect on the
default payment only.
For a discrete one-period (t, u) economy, the posted collateral at time t is C (t )  V (t ) . At time u,
there are several possible states: i) Both A and B survive. The instrument value is equal to the market
value V (u ) ; ii) Either or both counterparties A and B default. The instrument value is the future value of
the collateral, i.e., C (u )  V (t ) / D(t , u ) where we consider the time value of money only. Since the
majority of the collateral is cash according to ISDA (2012), it is reasonable to consider the time value of
money only for collateral assets. The large use of cash means that collateral is both liquid and not subject

2

There are three types of collateralization: Full-collateralization is a process where the posting of

collateral is equal to the current MTM value. Partial/under-collateralization is a process where the posting
of collateral is less than the current MTM value. Over-collateralization is a process where the posting of
collateral is greater than the current MTM value.

to large fluctuations in value. The value of the collateralized instrument at time t is the discounted
expectation of all the payoffs and is given by

V (t )  E D(t , u ) p00 (t , u )V (u )  p01 (t , u )C (u )  p10 (t , u )C (u )  p11 (t , u )C (u )  Ft 
 E  D(t , u ) p00 (t , u )V (u ) Ft   1  E  p00 (t , u ) Ft V (t )

(13a)

or





V (t )  E D(t , s) p00 (t , s)V (s) Ft / E  p00 (t , s) Ft



(13b)

If we assume that default probabilities are uncorrelated with interest rates and payoffs3, we have



V (t )  E D(t , s)V (s) Ft



(14)

Equation (14) is the formula for the risk-free valuation. Thus, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 2: If a bilateral risky instrument is fully collateralized, the risky value of the instrument is
equal to the risk-free value, as shown in equation (14).
Since an IRS is a typical bilateral risky contract, Proposition 2 squares with the results of
Johannes and Sundaresan (2007), and is also consistent with the current market practice in which market
participants commonly assume fully collateralized swaps are risk-free and it is common to build models
of swap rates assuming that swaps are free of counterparty risk.
1.3 Numerical results
To study the impact of bilateral credit risk, we have selected a new 10-year fixed-for-floating IRS
with a quarterly payment frequency. Two counterparties are denoted as A and B. Counterparty A pays a
fixed rate and counterparty B pays a floating rate. All calculations are from the perspective of party A.
The current (spot) market data are shown in Table 2, provided by FinPricing (2019). At the time
the contract is entered into, there is no advantage to either party. By definition, a swap rate is a fixed rate

Moody’s Investor’s Service (2000) presents statistics that suggest that the correlations between interest

rates, default probabilities, and recovery rates are very small and provides a reasonable comfort level for
the uncorrelated assumption.

12

that makes the market value of a given swap at initiation zero. The risk-free swap rate can be easily
calculated as 0.03433.
Since the payoff of an IRS is determined by interest rates, we need to model the evolution of the
floating rates. Interest rate models are based on evolving either short rates, instantaneous forward rates, or
market forward rates (e.g., the LIBOR Market Model (LMM)). Since both short rates and instantaneous
forward rates are not directly observable in the market, the models based on these rates have difficulties in
expressing market views and quotes in term of model parameters, and lack agreement with market
valuation formulas for basic derivatives. On the other hand, the object modeled under the LMM is
market-observable. It is also consistent with the market standard approach for pricing caps/floors using
Black’s formula. They are generally considered to have more desirable theoretical calibration properties
than short rate or instantaneous forward rate models. Therefore, we choose the LMM lattice proposed by
Xiao (2011) for pricing the defaultable IRS. We also implement the Hull-White trinomial tree to verify
the results and ensure robustness of the valuation. This paper, however, only reports the results produced
by the LMM lattice.
We first assume that i) counterparties A and B have independent default risks; ii) the hazard rates
are deterministic; and iii) both parties have a constant recovery of 60%. We use the LMM to evolve the
interest rates and then price the risky IRS according to Proposition 1. The risky swap rates are computed
and shown in Table 3.
From Table 3, we derive the following conclusions: First, a fixed-rate payer with lower credit
quality (higher credit risk) pays a higher fixed rate. Second, a credit spread of about 100 basis points
translates into a swap spread of about 1.3 basis points. Finally, the credit impact on swap rates is
approximately linear within the range of normally encountered credit quality. This confirms the findings
of Duffie and Huang (1996). Intuitively, a risk-free floating-rate payer demands a higher fixed rate if the
fixed-rate payer has a lower credit score.

We next present some new results. Assume that party A has an ‘A+300bps’ credit quality, i.e., a
‘300 basis points’ parallel shift in the A-rated credit spreads, and party B has an ‘A’ credit quality. The
risky swap rate with asymmetric credit qualities is calculated as 0.03436.
Assume  AB  0.5 . The effect of the default correlation  AB on swap rate is shown in Figure 1.
We can draw the following conclusions from the results: First, the counterparty default correlation and the
swap rates have a negative relation, i.e., a negative sensitivity of swap rates to changes in counterparty
default correlation is obtained. Second, the graph suggests an almost linear relationship between the swap
rates and the default correlation. Finally, the impact of the default correlation is modest (e.g., in the range
of [-2, 2] basis points).
Bilateral credit risk modeling is probably the simplest example involving default dependency, but
it shows several essential features for modeling correlated credit risk, which will help the reader better
understand the increasingly complex cases in the following section.

Pricing Financial Instruments Subject to Multilateral Credit Risk

The interest in the financial industry for the modeling and pricing of multilateral defaultable
instruments arises mainly in two respects: in the management of credit risk at a portfolio level and in the
valuation of credit derivatives. Central to the pricing and risk management of credit derivatives and credit
risk portfolios is the issue of default relationships.
Let us discuss the three-party case first. A CDS is a good example of a trilateral defaultable
instrument where the three parties are counterparties A, B and reference entity C. In a standard CDS
contract one party purchases credit protection from another party, to cover the loss of the face value of a
reference entity following a credit event. The protection buyer makes periodic payments to the seller until
the maturity date or until a credit event occurs. A credit event usually requires a final accrual payment by
the buyer and a loss protection payment by the protection seller. The protection payment is equal to the

14

difference between par and the price of the cheapest to deliver (CTD) asset of the reference entity on the
face value of the protection.
A CDS is normally used to transfer the credit risk of a reference entity between two
counterparties. The contract reduces the credit risk of the reference entity but gives rise to another form of
risk: counterparty risk. Since the dealers are highly concentrated within a small group, any of them may
be too big to fail. The interconnected nature, with dealers being tied to each other through chains of OTC
derivatives, results in increased contagion risk. Due to its concentration and interconnectedness, the CDS
market seems to pose a systemic risk to financial market stability. In fact, the CDS is blamed for playing a
pivotal role in the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the disintegration of AIG.
For years, a widespread practice in the market has been to mark CDS to market without taking the
counterparty risk into account. The realization that even the most prestigious investment banks could go
bankrupt has shattered the foundation of the practice. It is wiser to face frankly the real complexities of
pricing a CDS than to indulge in simplifications that have proved treacherous. For some time now it has
been realized that, in order to value a CDS properly, counterparty effects have to be taken into account.
The default indicator Y j for firm j (j = A or B or C) follows a Bernoulli distribution, which takes
value 1 with default probability q j , and value 0 with survival probability p j . The joint probability
representations of a trivariate Bernoulli distribution (see Teugels (1990)) are given by
p 000 : P(Y A  0, YB  0, YC  0)  p A p B pC  pC  AB  p B AC  p A BC   ABC

where

 ABC : E( YA  q A )( YB  q B )( YC  qC )

(15i)

Equation (15) tells us that the joint probability distribution of three defaultable parties depends
not only on the bivariate statistical relationships of all pair-wise combinations (e.g.,  ij ) but also on the
trivariate statistical relationship (e.g.,  ABC ).  ABC was first defined by Deardorff (1982) as comvariance,
who use it to correlate three random variables that are the value of commodity net imports/exports, factor
intensity, and factor abundance in international trading.
We introduce the concept of comvariance into credit risk modeling arena to exploit any statistical
relationship among multiple random variables. Furthermore, we define a new statistic, comrelation, as a
scaled version of comvariance (just like correlation is a scaled version of covariance) as follows:
Definition 1: For three random variables X A , X B , and X C , let  A ,  B , and C denote the means of
X A , X B , and X C . The comrelation of X A , X B , and X C is defined by

E( X A   A )( X B   B )( X C   C )

 ABC 
3

3

3

E X A   A  E X B   B  E X C  C

(16)

According to the Holder inequality, we have
E ( X A   A )( X B   B )( X C   C )   E ( X A   A )( X B   B )( X C   C )  3 E X A   A  E X B   B  E X C   C
3

3

(17)

Obviously, the comrelation is in the range of [-1, 1]. Given the comrelation, Equation (15i) can be
rewritten as
 ABC : E (YA  q A )(YB  qB )( X C  qC )    ABC 3 E YA  q A  E YB  qB  E YC  qC

(18)

where E(Y j )  q j and E Y j  q j  p j q j ( p 2j  q 2j ) , j=A, B, or C.
If we have a series of n measurements of X A , X B , and X C written as x Ai , xBi and xCi where i =
1,2,…,n, the sample comrelation coefficient can be obtained as:
16

i 1 ( x Ai   A )(xBi   B )(xCi  C )

(19)

More generally, we define the comrelation in the context of n random variables as
Definition 2: For n random variables X 1 , X 2 ,…, X n , let  i denote the mean of X i where i=1,..,n. The
comrelation of X 1 , X 2 ,…, X n is defined as
E( X 1  1 )( X 2   2 )    ( X n   n )

The correlation is just a specific case of the comrelation where n = 2. Again, the comrelation
 12...n is in the range of [-1, 1] according to the Holder inequality.

Risky valuation without collateralization
Recovery assumptions are important for pricing credit derivatives. If the reference entity under a

CDS contract defaults, the best assumption, as pointed out by J. P. Morgan (1999), is that the recovered
value equals the recovery rate times the face value plus accrued interest4. In other words, the recovery of
par value assumption is a better fit upon the default of the reference entity, whereas the recovery of
market value assumption is a more suitable choice in the event of a counterparty default.
Let valuation date be t. Suppose that a CDS has m scheduled payments. Let each payment be
represented as X i  sN (Ti 1 , Ti ) with payment dates T1 ,…, Tm where i=1,,,,m,  (Ti 1 , Ti ) denotes the
accrual factor for period (Ti 1 , Ti ) , N denotes the notional/principal, and s denotes the CDS premium.
Party A pays the premium/fee to party B if reference entity C does not default. In return, party B agrees to
pay the protection amount to party A if reference entity C defaults before the maturity. We have the
following proposition.
Proposition 3: The value of the multiple-payment CDS is given by

4

In the market, there is an average accrual premium assumption, i.e., the average accrued premium is half

the full premium due to be paid at the end of the premium.

Proof: See the Appendix.
We may think of O(t , T ) as the risk-adjusted discount factor for the premium and (t , T ) as the
risk-adjusted discount factor for the default payment. Proposition 3 says that the pricing process of a
multiple-payment instrument has a backward nature since there is no way of knowing which risk-adjusted
discounting rate should be used without knowledge of the future value. Only on the maturity date, the
value of an instrument and the decision strategy are clear. Therefore, the evaluation must be done in a
backward fashion, working from the final payment date towards the present. This type of valuation
process is referred to as backward induction.
18

Proposition 3 provides a general form for pricing a CDS. Applying it to a particular situation in
which we assume that counterparties A and B are default-free, i.e., p j  1 , q j  0 ,  kl  0 , and  ABC  0 ,
where j=A or B and k, l=A, B, or C, we derive the following corollary.

where O(Ti 1 , Ti )  D(Ti 1 , Ti ) pC (Ti 1 , Ti ) ; (Ti 1 , Ti )  D(Ti 1 , Ti )qC (Ti 1 , Ti ) .

If we further assume that the discount factor and the default probability of the reference entity are
uncorrelated and the recovery rate C is constant, we have
Corollary 2: Assume that i) counterparties A and B are default-free, ii) the discount factor and the default
probability of the reference entity are uncorrelated; iii) the recovery rate C is constant; the value of the
multiple-payment CDS is given by

p(t , Ti 1 )q (Ti 1 , Ti )  p(t , Ti 1 )  p(t , Ti ) .

This corollary is easily proved according to Corollary 1 by setting EXY Ft   EX Ft EY Ft 

Risky valuation with collateralization
According to the ISDA (2012), almost all CDSs are fully collateralized. Many people believe that

full collateralization can eliminate counterparty risk completely for CDS.
Collateral posting regimes are originally designed and utilized for bilateral risk products, e.g.,
IRS, but there are many reasons to be concerned about the success of collateral posting in offsetting the
risks of CDS contracts. First, the values of CDS contracts tend to move very suddenly with big jumps,
whereas the price movements of IRS contracts are far smoother and less volatile than CDS prices.
Second, CDS spreads can widen very rapidly. The amount of collateral that one party is required to
provide at short notice may, in some cases, be close to the notional amount of the CDS and may therefore
exceed that party’s short-term liquidity capacity, thereby triggering a liquidity crisis. Third, CDS
contracts have many more risk factors than IRS contracts.
We assume that a CDS is fully collateralized, i.e., the posting of collateral is equal to the amount
of the current MTM value: C(t )  V (t ) . For a discrete one-period (t, u) economy, there are several
possible states at time u: i) A, B, and C survive with probability p000 . The instrument value is equal to the
market value V (u) ; ii) A and B survive, but C defaults with probability p001 . The instrument value is the
default payment R(u) ; iii) For the remaining cases, either or both counterparties A and B default. The
instrument value is the future value of the collateral V (t ) / D(t , u) (Here we consider the time value of
money only). The value of the collateralized instrument at time t is the discounted expectation of all the
payoffs and is given by

V (t )  ED(t , u ) p000 (t , u )V (u )  p001 (t , u ) R(u )

(25b)

and D(t , u) pC (t , u)V (u)  qC (t , u) R(u) are

The first term V F (t ) in equation (26) is the counterparty-risk-free value of the CDS and the
second term is the exposure left over under full collateralization, which can be substantial.
Proposition 4: If a CDS is fully collateralized, the risky value of the CDS is NOT equal to the
counterparty-risk-free value, as shown in equation (26).
Proposition 4 or equation (26) provides a theoretical explanation for the failure of full
collateralization in the CDS market. It tells us that under full collateralization the risky value is in general
not equal to the counterparty-risk-free value except in one of the following situations: i) the market value
is equal to the default payment, i.e., V (u)  R(u) ; ii) firms A, B, and C have independent credit risks, i.e.,
 ij =0 and  ABC  0 ; or iii) p B AC  p A BC   ABC .

Numerical results
Our goal in this subsection is to study the quantitative relationship between the CDS premium

and the credit qualities of the counterparties and reference entity, including the default correlations and
comrelation in a CDS contract.
In our study, we choose a new 5-year CDS with a quarterly payment frequency. Two
counterparties are denoted as A and B. Counterparty A buys a protection from counterparty B. All
21

calculations are from the perspective of party A. By definition, a breakeven CDS spread is a premium that
makes the market value of a given CDS at inception zero. Assume that the reference entity C has an
“A+200bps” credit quality throughout this subsection. The 5-year counterparty-risk-free CDS premium is
0.027 (equals the 5-year ‘A’ rated CDS spread in Table 2 plus 200 basis points).
Since the payoffs of a CDS are mainly determined by credit events, we need to characterize the
evolution of the hazard rates. Here we choose the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. The CIR process has
been widely used in the literature of credit risk and is given by

where a denotes the mean reversion speed, b denotes the long-term mean, and  denotes the volatility.
The calibrated parameters are shown in table 4. We assume that interest rates are deterministic
and select the regression-based Monte-Carlo simulation (see Longstaff and Schwartz (2001)) to perform
risky valuation.
We first assume that counterparties A, B, and reference entity C have independent default risks,
i.e.,  AB   AC   BC   AB   ABC  0 , and examine the following cases: i) B is risk-free and A is risky;
and ii) A is risk-free and B is risky. We simulate the hazard rates using the CIR model and then determine
the appropriate discount factors according to Proposition 3. Finally we calculate the prices via the
regression-based Monte-Carlo method. The results are shown in Table 5 and 6.
From table 5 and 6, we find that a credit spread of about 100 basis points maps into a CDS
premium of about 0.4 basis points for counterparty A and about -0.7 basis points for counterparty B. The
credit impact on the CDS premia is approximately linear. As would be expected, i) the dealer’s credit
quality has a larger impact on CDS premia than the investor’s credit quality; ii) the higher the investor’s
credit risk, the higher the premium that the dealer charges; iii) the higher the dealer’s credit risk, the lower
the premium that the dealer asks. Without considering default correlations and comrelations, we find that,
in general, the impact of counterparty risk on CDS premia is relatively small. This is in line with the
empirical findings of Arora, Gandhi, and Longstaff (2009).

22

Next, we study the sensitivity of CDS premia to changes in the joint credit quality of associated
parties. Sensitivity analysis is a very popular way in finance to find out how the value and risk of an
instrument/portfolio changes if risk factors change. One of the simplest and most common approaches
involves changing one factor at a time to see what effect this produces on the output. We are going to
examine the impacts of the default correlations  AB ,  AC ,  BC , and the comrelation  ABC separately.
Assume that party A has an ‘A+100bps’ credit quality and party B has an ‘A’ credit quality. The 5-year
risky CDS premium is calculated as 0.02703.
Assume  AB =0.5. The impact diagrams of the default correlations and comrelation are shown in
Figure 2. From this graph, we can draw the following conclusions: First, the CDS premium and the
default correlations/comrelation have a negative relation. Intuitively, a protection seller who is positively
correlated with the reference entity (a wrong way risk) should charge a lower premium for selling credit
protection. Next, the impacts of the default correlations and comrelation are approximately linear. Finally,
the sensitivity slopes of the CDS premium to the default correlations and comrelation are -0.06 to  AB ; 0.09 to  AC ; -53 to  BC ; and -14 to  ABC . Slope measures the rate of change in the premium as a result
of a change in the default dependence. For instance, a slope of -53 implies that the CDS premium would
have to decrease by 53 basis points when a default correlation/comrelation changes from 0 to 1.
As the absolute value of the slope increases, so does the sensitivity. The results illustrate that  BC
has the largest effect on CDS premia. The second biggest one is  ABC . The impacts of  AB and  AC are
very small. In particular, the effect of the comrelation is substantial and has never been studies before. A
natural intuition to have on CDS is that the party buying default protection should worry about the default
correlations and comrelation.

3 Conclusion
This article presents a new valuation framework for pricing financial instruments subject to credit
risk. In particular, we focus on modeling default relationships. Some well-known risky valuation models

23

in the market can be viewed as special cases of this framework, when the default dependencies are
ignored.
To capture the default relationships among more than two defaultable entities, we introduce a
new statistic: comrelation, an analogue to correlation for multiple variables, to exploit any multivariate
statistical relationship. Our research shows that accounting for default correlations and comrelations
becomes important, especially under market stress. The existing valuation models in the credit derivatives
market, which take into account only pair-wise default correlations, may underestimate credit risk and
may be inappropriate.
We study the sensitivity of the price of a defaultable instrument to changes in the joint credit
quality of the parties. For instance, our analysis shows that the effect of default dependence on CDS
premia from large to small is the correlation between the protection seller and the reference entity, the
comrelation, the correlation between the protection buyer and the reference entity, and the correlation
between the protection buyer and the protection seller.
The model shows that a fully collateralized swap is risk-free, while a fully collateralized CDS is
not equivalent to a risk-free one. Therefore, we conclude that collateralization designed to mitigate
counterparty risk works well for financial instruments subject to bilateral credit risk, but fails for ones
subject to multilateral credit risk.

Figure 1. Impact of default correlation on swap rates
The curve in this diagram represents the sensitivity of swap rates to changes in counterparty default
correlation. Party A has an ‘A+300bps’ credit quality and party B has an ‘A’ credit quality. ‘A+300bps’
represents a ‘300 basis points’ parallel shift in the A-rated CDS spreads.
