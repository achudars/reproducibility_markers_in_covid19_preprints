Abstract
Acknowledgement appears at the forefront of the high-stakes academic genre of thesis/dissertation writing.
Previous research shows the generic structure of acknowledgements written by native Persian postgraduate
students contains a ‘thanking-God move’, absent in native English speakers’ acknowledgements. In an
approximate replication of Hyland’s (2004) study of the generic structure of acknowledgments, we aimed
to verify the occurrence, frequency, and variation of moves and steps in three small corpora of
acknowledgments from six disciplines (applied linguistics, business management, computer science,
electrical engineering, microbial biotechnology, & biochemistry). Each corpus contained 200 sample
acknowledgements written in Persian or English. The authors were native Persian speakers and native
English speakers. Fifty acknowledgements (100-400 words) were randomly selected from each corpus and
analyzed using Hyland’s model. Two coders carefully, content-analyzed, and coded the acknowledgments.
Then the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results confirmed findings of
previous research indicating that acknowledgements written by native Persian speakers (in Persian & in
English) contain all the moves and steps defined by Hyland plus a new step called ‘thanking-God’ step.
The use of this step was significantly different across Persian and English (84% in English & 100% in
Persian; X2= 1.63, p≤ 0.05) and across writers (84% Persian & 34% English; X2= 28.17, p≤.05). ‘Accepting
responsibility’ and ‘dedicating the thesis’ were used least frequently by all writers, while ‘thanking move’
and ‘reflecting move’ were used most frequently. Pedagogical and conceptual implications are discussed.

Introduction and Background
One of the major responsibilities of postgraduate learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) is to
master ‘academic discourse’. “English academic discourse is a clearly defined entity distinguished by a
series of identifiable characteristics” (Bennet, 2009, p. 44). This type of discourse, as Bennet (2009)
observes, is governed by certain principles including general principles (e.g., clarity, economy, objectivity,
argumentative techniques, & caution about claims), text structure principles (e.g., planning, text structure,
paragraph organization, coherence, & cohesion), grammatical issues (e.g., coordination & subordination,
active/passive, tense usage, & modality), lexical features (e.g., diction & technical jargon), and other
features (e.g., citation, plagiarism, & data presentation). To succeed as members of academic communities,
postgraduate EFL learners need the strategically vital familiarity with English academic discourse including
the different parts of theses and dissertations.
Recent instruction of and research on English academic discourse has been greatly informed and
influenced by developments in Bakhtinian genre analysis. Scholars working in this tradition (e.g., Giannoni,
2002; Swales, 1990) define academic discourse as a particular genre system used by academic communities
for distinct communicative purposes. This genre system includes a variety of text types used in academic
communities. Based on Giannoni’s (2002) summary, there are three major categories in the academic genre
system:
1) primary genres (research article, journal abstract, conference abstract, oral presentation, thesis,
dissertation, book, monograph, chapter, case report, review, & review article),
2) secondary genres (lecture, textbook, introductory text, post-introductory text, tutorial, & course
description), and
3) occluded genres (grant proposal, recommendation letter, request letter for material/advice,
application letter, submission letter, cover letter, research proposal, evaluation letter for
tenure/promotion, referees’ review of book/article, referees’ grant proposal review, memo to
dissertation committee, & editorial correspondence) (p. 3)
The present study looks at the genre of theses and dissertations, both of which fall under the category of
primary academic genres. The terms thesis and dissertation are not internationally used in the same way.
Whereas the terms dissertation and thesis are used for the final research work of M.A. and Ph.D. students
in the British convention, respectively, it is the reverse in the American convention. In this study, we
consider acknowledgments written by both M.A. and Ph.D. students in their final research projects. Located
on the highest point of the ‘academic genre ladder’ (Swales & Feak, 2000), the dissertation is a high-stakes
genre and probably the most important piece of writing which students perform in their academic studies
(Hyland, 2004). Written academic discourse including theses and dissertations are used not only to produce
texts representing an external reality but also to establish and maintain social relations (Hyland, 2003).
Apart from the function of transmitting information about the research carried out by authors, thesis and
dissertation acknowledgments also help establish interpersonal relations between students, supervisors,
scholars, and readers. In fact, the acknowledgment section in theses/dissertations is a section where various
manifestations of academic relationships can be observed and studied. Dating back to “a time when the
benevolence and generosity of those in authority were a prerequisite for publication” (Giannoni, 2002, p.
4), acknowledging contributions of others has now become an essential feature of academic communication
and writing, in general, and theses and dissertations, in particular (Hyland & Tse, 2004).
The acknowledgment genre is a significant academic genre particularly appreciated “by its positional
prominence, by survey data, and by its widespread use in a range of forums” (Hyland & Tse, 2004, p. 259).
Acknowledgments provide students with “a unique rhetorical space to both convey their genuine gratitude
for the assistance and promote a capable academic and social identity” (p. 259). They “allow students to

demonstrate their awareness of some central academic values such as modesty and gratitude, establish their
credibility, recognize debts, and achieve a sense of closure at the end of what is often a long and demanding
research process” (Hyland, 2004, p. 304). As Ben-Ari (1987) argues, acknowledgements are important from
a professional point of view since they enable the writer to not only manage his/her relationship with various
individuals involved in the research project such as supervisors, families, colleagues, etc. but also build
authorial credibility. Acknowledgments “support the research publication process but are not themselves
part of the research record” (Swales, 1996, p. 45). Thus, acknowledgments do not simply contain a list of
individuals to be thanked (Chan, 2015) but are “sophisticated and complex textual constructs which bridge
the personal and the public, the social and the professional, and the academic and the lay” (Hyland, 2003,
p. 265).
Research evidence on the genre structure of acknowledgments in different cultures is not yet inclusive
to clarify possible cross-cultural generic variations in this area. For example, some studies (e.g., Alemi &
Rezanejad, 2016; Abdollahian & Hashemi, 2013) have shown that Persian EFL writers consistently thank
God in their theses acknowledgments, a step claimed to be totally absent in academic acknowledgements
in other cultures. Since evidence supporting this claim is scanty, the present study methodologically
replicated Hyland’s (2004) analysis of the moves and steps of acknowledgments for further verification of
this finding on the structure of thesis/dissertation acknowledgments. The study aimed to not only verify this
previous finding but also add to the wealth of the available data.
To this end, in the current study, the frequency of moves and steps in English and Persian
acknowledgment sections of theses/dissertations written by native Persian-speaking writers were analyzed
and compared with those written by native speakers of English using Hyland’s (2004) model. Since
acknowledgments are not completely personal but reflect the writers’ linguistic and cultural background
leading them to write with different thought patterns, (Cheng, 2012), this cross-linguistic/cultural
examination of genre structure can be illuminating.
Review of Literature
Whereas a growing body of literature exists on genre analysis of thesis/dissertation introductions (e.g.,
Samraj, 2008; Soler-Monreal, Carbonell-Olivares, & Gil-Salom, 2011), abstracts (e.g., Friginal & Mustafa,
2017; Lorés, 2004; Martin, 2003, Samraj, 2005; Tanko, 2017), research article introductions (Bhatia, 1993;
Lim, 2012; Samraj, 2002), titles (Haggan, 2004; Jalilifar, 2010), method (Cotos et al., 2017; Lim, 2011,
2017), results (Atai & Falah, 2005; Lim, 2010; Williams, 1999), discussion (Basturkmen, 2012; Holmes,
1997; Lim, 2008), and conclusion (Bunton, 2002; Loi, Lim, & Wharton, 2016), there is not considerable
in-depth research on thesis/dissertation acknowledgements. A few studies have focused on different
academic features used to establish and maintain such scholarly identity and academic relationships (e.g.,
Hyland, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005; Kuo, 1999; Thompson, 2001). However, there is scanty research on
possible cross-cultural variations in the generic structure of acknowledgment sections of these/dissertations.
More specifically, based on expert views, “little is known of the ways other language groups or English L1
writers express thanks, the boundaries of personal choice, or of the influence of situational and personal
factors” (Hyland & Tse, 2004, p. 274). The latest retrieved studies, addressing a single language, are less
than two decades old (e.g., Giannoni, 2002; Hyland, 2003, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2004). Moreover, not much
is known about possible cross-cultural variations in acknowledgement sections of theses/dissertations in
various international academic contexts.
Acknowledgments, as our review of the related literature shows, are used to perform a variety of
functions. According to Hyland (2003), acknowledgments serve “as a means of demonstrating academic
credibility, recognizing debts, and achieving a sense of closure at the end of a long and demanding research
process” (p. 343). The role played by acknowledgments is related to both EFL learners and teachers.

Learners can show truths about the path that they took to complete one of their most serious academic
journeys, i.e., that of writing their thesis or dissertation. “For teachers, the fact that acknowledgments allow
learners to both formally record gratitude and construct a credible and sympathetic identity located in
networks of association suggests that this is a genre deserving of pedagogic attention” (Hyland & Tse, 2004,
p. 261). Acknowledgments provide student writers with an opportunity to appreciate the intellectual
guidance, support, inspiration, moral care, and research offered to them by different agents including
institutions, supervisors, informants, research committees, family members, etc. They bring authors into
legitimate discourse communities and guide them for future academic interactions (see Martin & Rose,
2003). In short, the literature shows that thesis/dissertation acknowledgments play very valuable roles, not
probably proportionately reflected in the volume of research devoted to them.
Seminal works on acknowledgments have attempted to explore their formal properties and show their
common linguistic and socio-communicative patterns including the analysis of their moves and steps in the
genre tradition. Dating back to 1972, one of the earliest attempts to explore the structure of
acknowledgments was the work of Mackintosh who investigated the structure of acknowledgments and
found that they were written to appreciate the help of different persons, access to data, and facilities (Tiew
& Sen, 2002). Much more recently, Hyland (2003) studied the way acknowledgments are textualized and
observed that they show rhetorical selections shaped by socio-cultural attributes. He identified both the
persons (professors, friends, family, etc.) and the activities (scholastic assistance, moral care, specialized
help, etc.) that were acknowledged in theses/dissertations at both M.A. and Ph.D. levels. He showed that
‘professors’ and ‘scholastic assistance’ were the most acknowledged ones comprising about half of the
acknowledgments. In 2004, Hyland developed a content-based framework for acknowledgments by
proposing three distinctive moves: Reflective Move (comment on the author’s experiences), Thanking Move
(appreciation of academic help, resources, family, and friends), and Announcing Move (acceptance of
responsibilities for flaws and the dedication).
Following these valuable attempts, another group of researchers have attempted to study the
acknowledging behavior of native speakers of different languages mostly based on the move and step
analysis carried out by Hyland (2004). Focusing on texts written in a particular language, this group of
researchers have not considered any cross-cultural comparisons. Examples include studies on
thesis/dissertation acknowledgments in English (Ben-Ari, 1987; Gesuato, 2008) and in other languages like
Arabic and Chinese (Al-Ali, 2009, 2010; Cheng, 2012; Cheng & Kuo, 2011; Lasaky, 2011; Zhang, 2012;
Zhao & Jiang, 2010).
Studies comparing cross-cultural variations in acknowledgements written by native and nonnative
speakers of English are very rare in the literature. Because of the academic identity roles associated with
acknowledgments, it is expected that there should be notable differences across languages and cultures in
the way people write the acknowledgements. To us, there can even be individual differences: in a very
strange case (probably aimed at showing journal gate-keepers’ and reviewers’ lack of due attention to the
acknowledgment sections of research articles submitted for publication), Beni, Koochi, and Abadyan
(2010) decided to write a very funny, totally meaningless acknowledgment that went unnoticed and was
publishedi! Generally speaking, expression and arrangement of acknowledgments are related to several
different factors such as “socio-cultural values, social norms, discourse communities, relationships between
acknowledgers and thanked addressees, identity and authorial credibility construction, and strategic career
choices” (Chan, 2015, p. 178).
Finally, some studies have shown that there are even inter-disciplinary variations in acknowledging
contributions to research. For example, research has shown that acknowledgements in soft sciences are
significantly more elaborate than those in hard sciences (Giannoni, 2002). Acknowledgements are

reportedly indicative of disciplinary practices in that scholars in hard sciences, compared with those in soft
sciences, use more acknowledgements, which might be due to the greater financial and institutional support
they receive (Cronin, McKenzie, & Rubio. 1993). Afful (2016) also found variations in acknowledgements
written by students in the English and Entomology and Wild-Life departments of a Ghanaian university.
In addition to the above studies, the related literature includes some studies that particularly look at
acknowledgments written by Persian EFL writers. Abdollahian and Hashemi (2013) used Hyland’s (2004)
model to analyze the acknowledgement sections of Ph.D. dissertations written by native Persian speakers
in English and Persian in several soft science majors. They found no statistically significant differences
between the generic structures used by these two groups. However, their analysis revealed two additional
steps, namely, thanking God and opening, used by native Persian Ph.D. students. Twenty-five percent of
the acknowledgements written in Persian included, in what was called the opening step, a Quranic verse, a
prophetic saying, prayers on the prophet, and an invocation followed by the expression and then, bringing
the author to the main acknowledgement body. Also, they reported the use of another move, i.e. thanking
God, through which the dissertation writers expressed their appreciation for God’s help. Their study,
however, does not make use of acknowledgements written in English by native English writers.
Mohammadi (2013) also used Hyland’s (2004) model to compare the generic move structures of
Ph.D. dissertation acknowledgements written by native Persian and English speakers in a wide variety of
fields including literature, translation studies, applied linguistics, history, sociology, library sciences,
theology, and philosophy. He discovered the thanking God step used by a large number of native Persian
speakers. It is noteworthy that he did not consider acknowledgements written in English by native Persian
writers, providing no basis for direct comparison of acknowledgements written in English and Persian by
native Persian writers. In a similar study (seemingly a replication of Mohammadi’s work), Lasaky (2011)
established a small corpus comprising acknowledgements written in English in applied linguistics and
found the new thanking God step reported to be used in a statistically significant way by native English and
native Persian writers.
In a later work with a remarkably similar methodology to Mohammadi (2013), Jalilifar and
Mohammadi (2014) studied 140 doctoral dissertation acknowledgments written in Persian by native
speakers of Persian and in English by native speakers of English in 7 soft science disciplines. They found
four moves with some constituting steps and reported both qualitative and quantitative variations between
the Persian and English texts. Their focus was on the role of beliefs in God in forming the structure of
acknowledgements written by Muslims including Iranians. It should be noted that their study did not focus
on English acknowledgements written by native Persian writers.
Alemi and Rezanejad (2016) analyzed the generic structure of dissertation acknowledgements
written in Persian from various disciplines in both hard and soft sciences. The results of their work revealed
that Iranian students use three main moves including ‘framing’, ‘thanking’, and ‘closing’ moves with six,
eleven, and four steps, respectively. They found some minute differences between acknowledgments
written in hard and soft sciences. Focusing on only Persian acknowledgments, their study does not provide
a good platform for any cross-linguistic comparisons.
Finally, Kuhi and Rezaei (2014) carried out an analysis of the generic features of acknowledgments
in applied linguistics written by native English writers and native Persian writers. They found that the use
of thanking God step by native Persian writers was the main difference between these acknowledgements.
To contribute to this body of research, the current study attempted to analyze acknowledgement
sections in dissertations and theses based on the descriptions of common moves and steps provided by

Hyland (2003) and explore cross-linguistic variations between Persian and English. More specifically, the
present study was guided by the following research questions:
1. In terms of frequencies of moves and steps, do thesis/dissertation acknowledgements written
by native Persian writers in English differ significantly from those written by native Persian writers in
Persian?
2. Is there any statistically significant difference between the frequencies of moves/steps in
thesis/dissertation acknowledgments written by native Persian writers in English and those in the
acknowledgments written by native Persian writers in Persian?
Methodology
The present contrastive genre analytic study focused on the description of moves and steps in
acknowledgment sections of theses and dissertations written by native and non-native speakers of English
following Hyland’s (2004) model in an approximate replication attempt. Methodological choices in the
current study described below were informed by available guidelines for the analysis of academic genres,
in general, and acknowledgment analysis, in particular (e.g. Hyland, 2003, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2004;
Swales, 1990).
Corpus
Three small corpora of acknowledgements were constructed for the purposes of the study: 1) Thesis and
dissertation acknowledgments written in ‘Persian’ by native Persian postgraduate students; 2) Thesis and
dissertation acknowledgments written in ‘English’ by native Persian postgraduate students; and 3) Thesis
and dissertation acknowledgments written in ‘English’ by native speakers of English. Each corpus
contained 200 acknowledgements of varying lengths (100-400 words) from six disciplines, namely, applied
linguistics, business management, computer science, electrical engineering, microbial biotechnology, and
biochemistry. This original data were collected from two universities in Tabriz (for native Persian speakers)
and ProQuest (for native English speakers from the US, England, & Australia) from 2012 to 2016. It should
be noted that authors were considered native speakers of English or Persian based on names, affiliations,
and biographical notes, and online data.

the distribution of the texts from each corpus. Each category of text type contained approximately 5000
words (Table 1).
Text Analysis
To analyze the selected texts, Hyland’s (2004) model of ‘move structure of dissertation acknowledgements’
was adopted, according to which there are three major moves in acknowledgment sections of

Move/Step Identification Procedures
The main task in the analysis of the data was the identification of moves and sub-moves or steps. In genre
analysis, the unit of analysis is a rhetorical move, which may carry more specific communicative functions
as reflected in steps (Swales, 2004). Following Hyland (2003), we considered any text segment (varying in
size and shape), which was constrained by a specific discourse goal, as a move. In other words, the moves
in the texts were considered as a functional unit used for some identifiable discoursal objective (see Connor,
2000; Holmes, 1997). The researchers read the acknowledgments meticulously sentence by sentence,
paying attention to the communicative purpose of each sentence. Suggestions for this type of analysis have
also been made by Bhatia (1993) based on which sentences are chosen as the unit of analysis, and their
communicative purpose becomes the identifying feature of each move. The process of identification of
moves involved focusing on formal clues such as explicit lexemes and expressions, verb forms, markers,
and sentence functions. Based on the descriptions provided by Hyland (2004), the communicative function
of each fragment in acknowledgements was given priority in identifying the move. The move structure
model was discussed and applied by both researchers to code the texts, and an inter-coder agreement of
93% was achieved. When there were disagreements in coding, the discrepancies were resolved by
discussion. In sum, linguistic evidence, practices of previous scholars (e.g. Hyland 2003, 2004), and doublecheck comprehension of the acknowledgement texts were the main guidelines in the coding process.
Data Analysis and Results
To address the first research question concerning the moves/steps common in native Persian speakers’
thesis and dissertation acknowledgments written in English and Persian, move analysis of acknowledgment
sections of theses/dissertations was carried out. The analysis revealed some interesting results: 1) the coding
and analysis of acknowledgements written by native Persian speakers (in Persian & in English) indicated
that they contained all the moves and steps defined by Hyland (2004), and 2) an additional step called
‘thanking-God’ was also discovered. In his move structure model, Hyland (2004) had suggested a fourstep thanking move. However, we needed to add a fifth step since a considerable number of the
acknowledgements written by native Persian speakers in English and Persian included strings that fulfilled
this function (N = 42, 84%: English; N = 50, 100%: Persian). Below are examples from the two types of
acknowledgements where the author’s communicative purpose was to thank God. These and other similar
instances in our sample could not be taken as academic or moral support, nor could they be coded as

thanking sources or participants directly involved in the research. Hence, they were coded as a new step,
i.e., ‘thanking-God’.

As can be seen from the results in Table 3, all native Persian speakers (100%) used the ‘thanking God’
step when writing in Persian, and 84% used this step when writing in English. In other words, native Persian
authors thanked God as an obligatory step in their writing in both their mother tongue and English. The
percentages of the use of this step (84% in English & 100% in Persian) were significantly different (X2=
1.63, p≤ 0.05).
The second research question probed possible differences between the moves/steps used in the
acknowledgment sections written in English by native Persian speakers and those by native speakers of
English. To this end, move and step frequencies were tabulated, and Chi-square tests were run in SPSS
(version 22) to find any statistically significant differences. As Table 4 shows, ‘accepting responsibility’

Moreover, Chi-square analyses indicated a statistically significant difference between native and
nonnative speakers of English in using the thanking God step (X2= 28.17, p≤.05). More specifically, only
17 native English speakers (34%) thanked God while 42 native Persian speakers (84%) used this step.
Discussion
This study was an approximate replication of Hyland’s (2004) study of the generic structure of
acknowledgment sections of theses and dissertations. It explored the occurrence, frequency, and variation
of moves and steps in three groups of acknowledgments: those written in Persian by native Persian speakers,
those in English by native Persian speakers, and those in English by native English-speaking authors.
Hyland’s (2004) model, utilized for the contrastive genre analysis of acknowledgment texts, fitted the data
(except for a minor step) and adequately explained the generic organization and communicative functions
of strings in the selected acknowledgments. Strings which could not be assigned to any of the steps or
moves specified in Hyland’s model were classified as an additional step called thanking God based on their
content. These strings could not be considered as expressions of gratitude for the moral support received
from family and friends because they had already been mentioned as realizations of another step. Findings
confirms the results of similar research by Iranian scholars (e.g., Alemi & Rezanejad, 2016; Jalilifar &
Mohammadi, 2014; Kuhi & Rezaei, 2014).
This finding can best be explained in the light of cultural/ideological dimensions of genre. As Cheng
(2012) observes, authors of acknowledgment sections are highly influenced by their cultural backgrounds
in employing rhetorical devices to fulfill communicative functions and express their identities. Iranian
students can rarely be seen to start a viva session, an academic presentation, a term paper, or in this case, a
thesis/dissertation acknowledgement without mentioning and thanking God. This additional step is, to us,
a reflection of how authors’ ideology can alter an otherwise agreed-upon generic structure. Even though
English acknowledgments written by Iranians included the thanking God step significantly less than Persian
acknowledgments (84% versus 100%), the high frequency of the use of this step in both English and Persian
texts clearly indicates how genre features may be transferred across cultures/languages.

Acknowledgement Structure in Persian and English Theses and Dissertations

Native Persian authors’ use of thanking God step reflects Fairclough’s (1995) view that the place of
text production and its situational and socio-cultural contexts highly affect its generic structure. Castleton
(2006) also confirms that social relations are regulated by religious percepts. To Castleton, such values are
indistinguishable from religious values, and communicative practices tend to be derived from an inner need
to satisfy religious beliefs. Individuals do not have to be either those who do favors or those who must
fulfill obligations for the thesis/dissertations writers to be acknowledged. They could be thanked because
of religious obligations, and in this context, the obligation to see God as present in man’s every act is very
noticeable.
Similarities between the moves and steps used by native Persian and native English writers can be
explained by a) possible similarities between the communicative purposes in the two contexts, and b) the
effect of instruction by professors and imitation of acknowledgements written by native English writers.
The findings of the study revealed that the most frequent moves in acknowledgments written in English
(by both native and nonnative speakers of English) were thanking and reflecting moves, while accepting
responsibility and dedicating steps were the least frequently used steps. The thanking-God move discovered
in the present analysis was not commonly used by native speakers of English. This finding also shows that
genres can vary across cultures. More specifically, some generic variations can assumably result from
writers’ authorial backgrounds as well as the requirements of the language in which the text is produced.
In other words, authors with different first languages write differently, and Iranian authors also write
differently when they compose texts in two different languages.
Conclusions and Suggestions
The findings of the current study not only confirm the generic structure of thesis/dissertation
acknowledgments described by Hyland (2004) but also show minor cross-linguistic and cross-cultural
variations in producing the same genre. Familiarity with these variations can be illuminating for both
research and pedagogy. As Hyland (2002) suggests, the mastery of genre knowledge would help students
in becoming members of their disciplinary community. Bhatia (1997) also confirms that genre analysis
provides novice writers with useful information about the conventions of a particular genre to enable them
to produce more complex texts. With the awareness of genre practices, novice writers can gain long-term
benefits from the explicit knowledge of genre conventions to ultimately produce more complex genres
based on genre exemplars (Loi & Evans, 2010).
Compared to the considerable amount of research on oral compliments across different cultural
settings, the literature on written acknowledgments is scanty. Future research in this area can shed more
light on the contrastive genre analysis of acknowledgements by collecting larger corpora from a wider range
of disciplines and first language backgrounds. This can provide opportunities to explore the effects of
nationality, linguistic and cultural background, and academic discipline on possible variations in composing
the acknowledgements.
