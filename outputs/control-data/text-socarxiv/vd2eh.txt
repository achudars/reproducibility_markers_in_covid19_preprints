Does Job Satisfaction, Fair Treatment, and Cooperativeness Influence the
Whistleblowing Practice in Malaysian Government Linked Companies?
Abstract
Purpose: Whistleblowing is an important factor in preventing corruption and fraud in
organizations. There is a law to promote whistleblowing practices, but the negative
subsequent effect of whistleblowing demotivates the reporting of unethical behaviours. Thus,
it is important to identify the factors that motivate an employee to exercise whistleblowing in
an organization. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether the personal factor of job
satisfaction and organizational factors such as fair treatment as well as cooperativeness
contribute to the whistleblowing practice in an organization.
Design/methodology/approach: This study collected primary data based on a questionnaire
survey from 73 respondents of the seven top most GLCs in Malaysia. The data are analyzed
using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings: The findings of the study reveal that only fair treatment is statistically significant
and positively related to the whistleblowing practice. The findings imply that if employees
perceive that the organization provides fair treatment in terms of career advancement, awards,
training, performance appraisal, job assignment, and pay increases, they would tend to report
wrongdoing activities to protect the image of the organization.
Practical implications: The findings of the study will help the policy makers to ensure better
working environment and accountability in the public sector of Malaysia and other similar
countries.
Originality/value: This is an original study based on primary data to examine the current
practices of whistleblowing and its relationship with the practices of job satisfaction, fair
treatment, and cooperativeness in the government linked companies of Malaysia.
Keywords: Government Linked Company (GLC); Job Satisfaction; Fair Treatment;
Cooperativeness; Whistleblowing practice
1. Introduction
Whistleblowing can be defined as “the voluntary release of information, as a moral protest,
by a member of an organization about illegal or immoral conduct in the organization that is
opposed to the public interest” (Chiu, 2003). Near and Miceli (1985) define whistleblowing
as “the disclosure by organization members on illegal, or illegitimate practices to persons”
(Read & Rama, 2003). Ponemon and Gabhart (1994) state that “whistle-blowing can play an
essential role as a defective control if an organization explicitly incorporates reporting
mechanism that discloses incident of wrongdoing.
As the number of fraud cases continues to rise sharply over the years due to failures in
reporting activities deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization (Said,
Alam, & Khalid, 2016; Cecilia, 2013; Chiu, 2003), whistleblowing may mitigate bigger
losses, as the longer the fraud goes undiscovered, the bigger the losses would be (Taylor &
Curtis, 2010; Cecilia, 2013; Ghani, Galbreath, & Evans, 2012). The decision to whistleblow
is considered an expression of rebellion especially in public organizations (Cecilia, 2013). It
involves conflicting values between loyalty to the organization and accountability to the
public (Johnson, 2003). Glazer (1987) states that whistleblowers are “ethical resisters in
government” who “disobey their superiors” when they bring attention to issues. The act of
whistleblowing is considered a political act when it involves public servants.
2

There are some legal protections available for whistleblowers. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (SOX) is one of the acts that has been introduced as a result of financial scandals. One
of the concerns addressed by SOX is the protection of whistleblowers. Section 806 of the Act
states that a company is prohibited from retaliating against an employee after the disclosure
of misconduct in the organization. This should increase the effectiveness of whistleblowing
activities since it has been proven that employees are reluctant to engage in whistleblowing
because of the subsequent effects (Moberly, 2006).
However, in reality there are many reasons why whistleblowing does not happen
widely. Although whistleblowing gives a spark to the monitoring control, it usually brings
undesirable consequences to the whistleblower (Chiu, 2003). Some of them will lose their
jobs, receive threats of revenge, experience social isolation at work, face retaliation from the
management, and end up getting an unfair treatment from the company. It has been reported
that 90% of whistleblowers lose their jobs or are demoted (Chiu, 2003). Such after-effects
from reporting misconduct deter many employees from reporting corporate misconduct.
Many organizations adopt a whistleblowing policy as one of the internal control
mechanisms to improve the efficiency of the monitoring process related to fraud and
corruption (PWC, 2014). However, past studies have proven that the whistleblower tends to
face consequences in the future; this is one of the factors that lead to the failure of the
whistleblowing mechanism (Ngui, 2005; Seifert, 2006). Previous studies have focused on the
effects of financial rewards associated with the whistleblowing activity. Stikeleather (2001)
found that employers can support whistleblowing and earn a higher pay-off by offering
workers with explicit financial rewards for whistleblowing, but this eventually decreases the
workers’ non-financial motivation to blow the whistle. Cecilia (2013) used a mixed method
approach to examine the relationship between individual and organizational elements that
encourage employees to report wrongdoing in the civil system. Lipman (2012) believed that
there are ineffective whistleblowing programmes conducted by organizations. The
organizational environment contributes to the effectiveness of the whistleblowing policy.
According to a PWC report (2014), organizations have an effective whistleblowing system
but they do not implement the system in real life. The effective system is only on paper but
not in practice.
Previous studies have discussed the factors that encourage employees to engage in
whistleblowing activities. Seifert (2006) found that a fair whistleblowing procedure has a
positive effect on the likelihood of reporting misconduct by employees. The fair environment
includes treatment by management, interaction with management regarding whistleblowing
as well as the whistleblowing procedure (Seifert, 2006). It is viewed that fair environment is
associated with a higher whistleblowing practice. Extensive studies have examined both
individual and organizational factors on whistleblowing practices (Rice, 2015; Cecilia, 2013;
Alleyne, 2010).
Currently, Asian countries are still in the early stage of the whistleblowing
implementation compared to some developed countries (Park, Rehg, & Lee, 2005). Negative
implication of whistleblowing is one of the possible reasons that results in Asian countries
being less aggressive in embracing the whistleblowing action (Ghani, Galbreath, & Evans,
2012). Meanwhile in Malaysia, whistleblowing is still in its introductory stage and is a lessfavoured medium to report wrongdoing in organizations (Ngui, 2005).

In Malaysia, the role of whistleblowing as an internal control mechanism is only
regarded by the statutory authorities (Anwar, 2003). The first whistleblowing law was
introduced in 2003 under the Securities Industry Act 2003. Subsequently, the Malaysian
government has encouraged all organizations to support the whistleblowing law in return
with protection to move towards a corruption-free country (Hassan, 2006). There are issues in
which GLCs are involved in fraud and corruption. The GLC Transformation Programme
(GTP) has a major role in nation-building and the strategic execution of structural economic
changes. While the GTP promises increased transparency, questions are being asked as to
whether the GLC has actually driven the economy to deliver such an assurance. As an
example related to the whistleblower website, various postings have been posted with regards
to the activities of one of the Malaysian GLCs, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)
which to date remain unanswered. Some of the questions are related to whether there has
been a falsification of documents by 1MDB1. Therefore, the involvement of the
whistleblowing practice is of utmost importance especially in the internal aspect, as it will
reduce fraud incidents.
In Malaysia, GLCs are known as the main providers of utilities, airlines, airport,
public transportation, water and sewerage, and financial services. Some of them are also
involved in the automotive, plantation, and construction industries. These organizations
employ around 5% (about 400,000 employees) of the national workforce and account for
approximately 36% of the Malaysian Stock Exchange market capitalization (Abdullah, 2005).
By considering the significance of the GLC to the economy, an understanding of the
whistleblowing practice in the GLC organizations is indeed significant, and thus requires an
intensive research.
In Malaysia, although the whistleblower protection act has been established to protect
the informer, the actual implementation remains low and the research conducted is limited.
Even though the whistleblowing act protects the whistleblower’s right, many people are still
indecisive due to personal and organizational factors. This study aims to investigate the
whistleblowing behaviour in Government Linked Companies by exploring the individual and
organizational characteristics that influence the employees’ behaviour to be involved in
whistleblowing. Evaluation of both individual and organizational factors will help an
organization to understand the factors that improve the effectiveness of the whistleblowing
system and simultaneously reduce the likelihood of fraud and corruption.
2. Literature Review and Hypotheses Development
2.1 Job Satisfaction and the Whistleblowing Practice
Alleyne (2010) found that individual factors such as attitude, commitment, personal
responsibility, and behavioural control significantly influence people to whistleblow.
Individual satisfaction will increase the likelihood of certain behaviours such as reporting
wrongdoing (Miceli & Near, 1992). Employees who are satisfied with their work,
environment, and payment are inclined to protect their jobs as well as their organization
(Cecilia, 2013). Besides, other researches have proposed that highly satisfied workers are less
likely to engage in whistleblowing. This is because the environment shapes the employees to
be efficient and follow ethical standards, thus reducing the occurrence of fraud. Job
satisfaction is significantly associated with the intention to whistleblow (Cecilia, 2013).

Meanwhile, Miceli and Near (2005) suggest that job satisfaction affects
whistleblowing since job satisfaction keeps changing in response to a speciﬁc job situation,
and it is deduced that whistleblowers are less satisfied with their jobs than the non-reporting
observers. For example, an observer of wrongdoing with a higher negative disposition is less
satisfied than one with a higher positive disposition, so he/she is likely to report the
wrongdoing. Another research suggests that job satisfaction is positively related to
whistleblowing (Viswesvaran Deshpande & Joseph, 1998). Job satisfaction is higher when
supervisors endorse an ethical working behaviour (Viswesvaran Deshpande & Joseph 1998).
The findings reveal that individuals who perceive top management as being supportive will
be more satisfied with their jobs, reflecting their ethical behaviour.
There is a mixed result on the relationship between job satisfaction and the
whistleblowing practice. Some studies have found that highly satisfied workers are less likely
to engage in pro-social behaviour (Shawver & Clement, 2008; Sims & Keenan, 1998; Vakola
& Bouradas, 2005). A study conducted by Cecilia on 36,926 employees in 24 federal
agencies in the US found a negative relationship between job satisfaction and the likelihood
to whistleblow in the federal government (Cecilia, 2013). The negative association is due to
job satisfaction, thus reducing the action that will affect the organizational image. In the
context of GLCs, an act of reporting misconduct is believed as an expression of rebellion
(Cecilia, 2013), which reflects disloyalty to the organization (Johnson, 2003) and an
indication of disobedience to the superiors (Glazer,1987). Therefore, it is proposed that:
H1: There is a significant negative relationship between job satisfaction and the
whistleblowing practice.
2.2 Fair Treatment and the Whistleblowing Practice
Fairness is a term that is often interchangeably used with justice by social scientists.
Procedural and distributive justice is closely associated with employee motivation and goaloriented behaviour (Kanungo, 1982; Lawler, 1992; Lodahl & Kejnar, 1965; Paullay, Alliger,
& Stone, 1994). Previous research has suggested that fair treatment within the workplace will
increase the report of wrongdoing in the organization (Rothschild & Miethe, 1999; Near,
Dworkin, & Miceli, 1993; Seifert, 2006; Trevino & Weaver, 2001). On the other hand, other
studies which focus on civil servants disclose that a variety of organizational and job-related
factors, such as fairness, do influence employees’ motivation and their involvement in work.
The working environment will stimulate the employees’ behaviour, thus influencing the way
they react towards their organization. Besides, fairness in reporting procedures is more
favourable and there will be less retaliation for those involved in whistleblowing (Near,
Dworkin, & Miceli, 1993). The perception of having a fair treatment will make the
employees comfortable to talk to the management regarding the matter that is against the
organizational goal. Trevino and Weaver (2001) also assessed whether the employees are
more willing to help the organization in dealing with problems that will affect the
organization’s achievement and report ethical problems to the management. The findings
reveal that a perceived fair treatment is a significant predictor of the number of reports lodged
to the management.
A study conducted by Murray (2006) shows that the inclination to report a
wrongdoing is positively related to procedural justice, interactional justice, role
responsibility, and issue severity. Justice or fairness involves all aspects in the organization,
5

which are the treatment given by the organization, procedures, colleagues, and others. The
fair treatment provided by the management results in a sense of belonging by the employees
to the company. The feeling of responsibility leads the employees to protect the company’s
image and reputation from being tarnished by malpractice (Trevino & Weaver, 2001). In
addition, fairness in the context of whistleblowing procedures and treatment will enhance the
employees’ willingness to engage in the whistleblowing practice. Retaliation is one of the
factors that hinders the employees from reporting a misconduct. Cecilia (2013), however,
discovers an opposite finding, in which there is a negative relationship between fair treatment
and report of wrongdoing. By having a fair and just treatment from the management and
colleagues, employees are keen to report any wrongdoing. Therefore, it is proposed that:
H2: There is a significant positive relationship between fair treatment and the
whistleblowing practice.
2.3 Cooperativeness and the Whistleblowing Practice
Rothwell and Baldwin (2006) state that a cooperative work environment can be found in the
organizational culture, in which teamwork and group cohesiveness prevail in the
organizational decision-making. Cooperation occurs when the employees in the organization
have a strong relationship to work together and achieve their goals. Cooperativeness and a
flexible working environment will improve productivity and workers will be more engaged in
their work. The balance demands more work and other aspects of the workers’ life in
contributing towards a cooperative and flexible environment. In addition, research has proven
that a cooperative and flexible work arrangement reduces the stress level and boosts the
employees’ satisfaction in their jobs.
A cooperative environment will enhance the decision-making process (Rothwell &
Baldwin, 2006). Research also proves that a team’s mutual interest and cooperation are
significantly related to the willingness to report misconduct. Besides, the employees are more
willing to discuss with the management regarding the misconduct done by their colleagues
(Rothwell & Baldwin, 2007). In line with previous studies, Vadera, Aguilera, and Caza
(2009) also found similar findings, in which a friendly and cooperative team is more likely to
engage in a whistleblowing practice.
In contrast, some researchers found a different association, in which a more
cooperative and flexible working environment would reduce the tendency of employees from
engaging in a pro-social behaviour. A respectful and cooperative environment provides a
better communication medium and procedures when a wrongdoing is observed, thus reducing
the implementation of the whistleblowing practice (Cecilia, 2013). However, this result was
focused on federal employees who have a different social and working environment
compared to non-federal employees. In the study, Cecilia also explains that the
cooperativeness in the federal working environment are perceived to contribute to less
wrongdoing (Cecilia, 2013). A few federal employees feel responsible for reporting
wrongdoing as the working environment itself operates as a diffuser for intervention.
Moreover, the cooperative and flexible environment with good communication and
commitment would encourage the employees to handle the misconduct internally due to an
excellent teamwork. Therefore, it is proposed that:
H3: There is a significant positive relationship between cooperativeness and the
whistleblowing practice.

3. Methodology
3.1 Sampling and Data Collection
Data for the study were collected based on a random survey from 7 out of 47 GLCs in
Malaysia. The selected companies are UMW Holding Bhd., TH Plantation Bhd., TH Heavy
Engineering Bhd., Tenaga Nasional Bhd., Sime Darby Bhd., CIMB Group Bhd., and Axiata
Group Bhd. The survey questionnaires were distributed to 120 individuals from different
positions in the 7 selected GLCs, and a total of 73 sets of questionnaires were collected from
the respondents.
3.2 Determinants of Variable
This research used the conceptual framework created by Miceli, Near, and Dworkin (2008) to
answer the issues regarding individual and organizational elements that encourage the
whistleblowing practice. This study used ten parameters to measure practices of
whistleblowing, seven factors to measure job satisfaction and fair treatment, and eight factors
to measure cooperativeness. The list of the items/parameters is presented in the appendix. A
seven-point Likert-type rating scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)
was used in the questionnaire.
3.3 Model and Statistical Test
The data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional
regression. Initially, validity of the data is tested through several standard diagnostic
procedures – the adequacy of data is tested using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test; the normality
of data is tested using the skewness and kurtosis analysis; and the homoscedasticity of data is
tested using the F-test and Bartlett Sphericity test. Then, a correlation analysis is carried out
to check the multicollinearity problem. Finally, the reliability of the data is tested by using
the Cronbach’s alpha test.
4. Results and Findings
4.1 Demographic Information
Among the respondents, approximately 50.7% are female (Table 1). Most of the respondents
are in the 26 to 30 years age group, which comprised approximately 48% of the total
respondents. Nearly all of the respondents have at least a bachelor's degree. Approximately
40% of the respondents have been working for 1 to 3 years, whereas 30% of the respondents
have been working for 4 to 5 years. As for salary ranges, 45% of the respondents stated that
their salary is within RM3000 to RM4000 range and 31% mentioned that their salary is
within RM2000 to RM3000 range.

4.2 Correlation Analysis
Correlation examines the relationship between two variables in a linear fashion (Coakes,
Steed, & Price, 2008). This analysis helps to identify whether one variable is related to
another. Prior to testing the model, the correlation analysis is performed to examine the
relationship among the variables. For this study, a Pearson Correlation test is used to
ascertain whether there are any multicollinearity problems occurring. The two variables are
considered highly correlated to each other and explain the dependent variable, which will
cause a multicollinearity problem if the values of coefficient are 0.8 or 0.9, and above (Field,
2000).
Table 2 shows the summary of the results when the bivariate analysis is done to test
the correlation between one variable to another. The statistical results show that the
correlation values among the variables range between 0.25 and 0.69. This indicates that there
is no multicollinearity problem among the variables since none of the correlation is more than
0.8. The results also show statistically significant and positive relationships among the
variables, but the whistleblowing practice shows a low level of correlations with others.

4.3 Regression Analysis
Based on the result, the regression stands statistically at a 5% (p < 0.05) level that also
indicates the homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances, but the R2 value indicates that
only 16% of the whistleblowing practice can be explained by this model (Table 3).

The regression output depicts that there is a statistically significant and positive
relationship between the whistleblowing practice and fair treatment. Hence, this result
indicates that fair treatment in regards to career advancement, awards, training, performance
appraisal, job assignment, discipline, and pay has a significant positive relationship to the
whistleblowing practice. This is similar to the studies conducted by Near, Dworkin, and
Miceli (1993), Rothschild and Miethe (1999), Trevino and Weaver (2001), and Seifert
(2006). They found that fair treatment in the workplace increases the report of wrongdoing.
The fairness in the organization will be the determinant factor for employees to be more open
in reporting any misconduct to the management (Rothschild & Miethe, 1999). Besides, fair
treatment from the management affects the employee perceptions where they believe they
own something in the organization (Trevino & Weaver, 2001). In contrast with another study
conducted by Cecilia (2013), fairness in the organization reduces the report of wrongdoing.
The difference in the findings may be due to different working environments because the
study conducted by Cecilia was done among federal employees.
The regression output shows a negative but statistically insignificant relationship
between the whistleblowing practice and job satisfaction. This result is similar to the findings
from previous studies conducted by Sims and Keenan (1998), in which they failed to find any
relationship between job satisfaction and whistleblowing. Similarly, the study done by
Shawver and Clement (2008) found that accounting professionals with higher satisfaction are
less likely to engage in a whistleblowing activity. When the employees are satisfied with the
task given and the working environment, they are less likely to report any wrongdoing in the
organization.
The regression output shows a positive but statistically insignificant relationship
between the whistleblowing practice and cooperativeness. The finding is in line with a
previous study conducted by Cecilia (2013), where it is revealed that cooperativeness and a
flexible environment has no effect on the whistleblowing practice. A cooperative
environment induces the workers to neglect any wrongdoings that occur in the organization.
They tend to accept any misconduct since they are familiar with the situations. This is
different from a study conducted by Vadera, Aguilera, and Caza (2009), in which they
revealed that strong ethics and a friendly environment increase the likelihood of the
whistleblowing practice.
4.4 Diagnostic Test
In order to ensure the data is normally distributed, the study examines the skewness and
kurtosis of the data. According to Tabachnick and Fidell (2001), the data is considered
normal if the value of skewness and kurtosis is between -2 to +2. Based on Table 4, the
9

skewness for all variables show a normal distribution as all the values are between -2 to +2
(Table 4). In addition, the kurtosis of the data for all variables shows that the data distribution
is normal.

Reliability analysis looks at the internal consistency and stability of the measuring
instrument. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is commonly used as the internal consistency
indicator. The ideal value of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient differs among various studies.
Nunnally (1978, p.226) suggests a modest reliability ranging between 0.5 and 0.6 would
suffice for an initial study. Loewenthal (2004) mentions the value of 0.6 could be acceptable.
Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham (2010) mention that the generally agreed lower
limit for Cronbach’s alpha may decrease to 0.60 in an exploratory research. Pallant (2007)
mentions it should be above 0.700. The results of the Cronbach’s Alpha for all of the
variables in this study are more than 0.9, which means all the statements are reliable (Table
4).
Moreover, by using the varimax rotations, an exploratory factor analysis is performed
to understand the correlations structure of each variable and the sampling adequacy. The
factor analysis provides the consistency of these variables for the measurement of job
satisfaction, fair treatment, cooperativeness, and the whistleblowing practice. The factor
loadings for all the variables are more than 0.6 (Appendix). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
coefficient for these dataset is 0.987 for job satisfaction, 0.91 for fair treatment, 0.826 for
cooperativeness, and 0.847 for the whistleblowing practice, indicating that the data could be
used to proceed with the exploratory factor analysis (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &
Tatham, 2010).
In addition, to test the homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances, the Bartlett
Sphericity test is conducted where the value for job satisfaction (Chi-square=380,
p<.000001), fair treatment (Chi-square=352, p<.000001), cooperativeness (Chi-square=429,
p<.000001), and the whistleblowing practice (Chi-square=673, p<.000001) are noted to be
statistically significant.
5. Conclusion
Whistleblowing is actually the act of people who believe that the public interest is important
so they get involved in reporting the wrongdoing. This study is carried out to examine the
relationship between an individual factor that is job satisfaction and organizational factors
that are fair treatment and cooperativeness towards the whistleblowing practice in
government linked companies (GLCs) in Malaysia.
This study found that fair treatment has a statistically significant and positive
relationship with the whistleblowing practice, but job satisfaction and cooperativeness have
no statistically significant relationship with the whistleblowing practice. However, there are
10

some limitations in this study that need to be taken care of in future researches by considering
a larger sample size and different groups of samples.
Whistleblowing and fraud are highlighted in numerous academic studies nowadays.
The occurrence of fraud can be reduced by the implementation of the whistleblowing practice
within the organizational culture. The findings would be useful for many parties especially
the regulatory authorities, management, and those who are responsible for persuading the
employees to be involved in reporting wrongdoing. Besides that, the management in each
organization should be more aware of the environment that will enhance the participation of
employees to report wrongdoings. In addition, the management also needs to give fair
treatment to all the employees without any discrimination. The fairness perceived by the
workers will change their attitudes and thus lead them to be involved in extra pro-social
behaviors.
