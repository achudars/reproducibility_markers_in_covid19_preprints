ABSTRACT
This study replicates Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane’s (2019b) earlier analysis of the rise of
self-defense in gun advertisements in The American Rifleman. It uses the same
methodological procedures and applies them to a for-profit, general interest firearm
magazine that has been continuously published for 65 years: Guns magazine. Like the
earlier study, we hypothesize that the center of gravity in US gun culture has evolved
over time from “Gun Culture 1.0,” the historic gun culture of hunting and recreational
shooting, to “Gun Culture 2.0,” America’s contemporary defensive gun culture, an
evolution reflected in the content of gun advertisements. The data show that the
predominance of Gun Culture 1.0 themes in advertising persists through the 1980s and
into the 1990s, when the center of gravity of gun culture begins to shift decisively
toward the Gun Culture 2.0 themes of personal protection/self-defense and concealed
carry. This trend continues through the 1990s and 2000s, with the two emphases
crossing-over in the 2010s. As reflected in advertising, in addition to other indicators
such as self-reported reasons for gun ownership, Gun Culture 2.0 is now America’s
dominant and still expanding core gun culture today.

As others have argued at great length, guns were part of the social reality of the
United States well prior to its Declaration of Independence from the British crown and
its Constitutional founding (Cramer, 2006; Dunbar-Ortiz 2018; Winkler, 2011). Selfdefense has been part of American gun culture for just as long. 18th century versions of
the same defensive “pocket pistols” that dominate today’s concealed carry marketplace
(Yamane 2019a) can be found in any museum with a substantial firearms collection. The
importance of having a defensive firearm ready at hand can be seen in late 19th century
advertisements for Smith & Wesson’s “bicycle revolver” in Forest and Stream magazine
and Forehand Arms Co.’s “That dog will never bark again!” advertisement in Recreation
magazine (see Figure 1). In the early 20th century, Iver Johnson advertised their
revolvers for home defense in Collier’s National Weekly with the tag line “Now you won’t
feel afraid.”1 And as motor cars became more accessible to the masses in the 1920s, the
need for personal protection while driving was emphasized in Colt’s firearms “Safety of
the Highways” advertisement, perhaps the original “When seconds count, police are
just minutes away” ad (see Figure 2). With the exception of the bicycle gun, parallel
advertisements for defensive firearms can be seen today, like Remington’s “Live
Ready” campaign for the R51 subcompact handgun which highlights potential threats
while driving (see Figure 3).

The existence of 18th century pocket pistols and 19th/early 20th century selfdefense based gun advertising highlights the continuity of gun culture over a long
period of time (Haag 2016). But this does not mean that nothing has changed over the
past 300 years. Examining contemporary American society, a number of observers
highlight significant developments. Although the motivations for gun ownership are
complex, the majority of gun owners today—especially new gun owners—point to selfdefense as the primary reason for owning a gun (Wertz, et al. 2018). In a 1999 ABC
News/Washington Post poll, 26% of respondents cited protection as the primary reason
for owning a gun; by 2013, that proportion had grown to 48%. Hunting, target/sport
shooting, and gun collecting together declined by a roughly equal amount (Pew
Research Center 2013). More recently, the 2015 National Firearms Survey found 63% of
respondents indicated “protection against people” to be a primary reason for owning a
firearm (Azrael, et al. 2017).
These statistics parallel the changing legal structure governing the carrying and
use of firearms for self-defense. Two hundred years after Kentucky banned the carrying
of concealed weapons in public in 1813, state or local governments in all fifty states
must have some provision in place for issuing permits to citizens allowing them to carry
concealed firearms in public. More liberal “shall issue” laws prevail in forty of fifty
states, and only nine states maintain more restrictive “may issue” laws (Steidley 2019a,
2019b). Vermont has never banned the practice of carrying a concealed weapon without
6

a permit and so does not issue concealed-carry permits. Permitless carry represents the
next phase of this liberalization of gun laws. Including Vermont, fifteen states now
allow individuals to carry a concealed weapon in public without a permit, with certain
restrictions and exceptions.
Although we recognize the contuining existence of various subcultures of guns
in the US (Kohn 2004, Luke 2019, Taylor 2013), these changes suggest the movement of
self-defense to the core of American gun culture today. With this shift, previously
dominant subcultures like hunting and recreational target shooting (Hofstadter 1970)
have become more marginal. Gun journalist Michael Bane calls this an evolution from
“Gun Culture 1.0” to “Gun Culture 2.0.” Gun Culture 2.0 centers on home and personal
protection through armed citizenship, notably the legal carrying of concealed weapons,
mostly handguns, in public by ordinary Americans (Yamane 2017).
Although examining changes in public opinion and the law are important to
documenting the emergence of America’s new defensive gun culture, these data only
track changes back two to three decades. To access a longer-term perspective on shifting
emphases within American gun culture, Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane (2019b) conducted
a systematic content analysis of advertisements in The American Rifleman magazine for
every year from 1918 to 2017. They documented a steady pattern of decline of Gun
Culture 1.0 over the past 100 years and the ongoing rise of Gun Culture 2.0. They also

7

identified the point at which the two centers of gravity in gun culture crossed paths in
the early 2010s.
The American Rifleman is a good choice for such an analysis, as the oldest and
most widely-circulated gun magazine (Hardy 2012, Rajala 2012). Part of its circulation
strength, however, is because it is offered as a member benefit to National Rifle
Association (NRA) members. As an official publication of the NRA, it is possible that its
advertising content is biased by the NRA’s political interests. Also, the NRA publishes
other magazines focusing on hunting (American Hunter, since 1973) and the Second
Amendment (America’s First Freedom, since 1997) that members can choose instead of
The Rifleman. Therefore, it is possible that changes in the content of the advertising in
The Rifleman reflects the availability of these other magazines rather than a change in the
core emphasis of gun culture. For example, if hunting appears less in advertising in The
American Rifleman over time, is that explained in part by the availability of American
Hunter for advertisers to target hunters?
This paper, therefore, replicates Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane’s (2019b) earlier
analysis of the rise of self-defense in gun advertisements in The American Rifleman. It
uses the same methodological procedures and applies them to a for-profit, general
interest firearm magazine that has been continuously published for 65 years: Guns
magazine. Like the earlier study, we hypothesize that the center of gravity in US gun
culture has evolved over time from Gun Culture 1.0, the historic gun culture of hunting
8

and recreational shooting, to Gun Culture 2.0, America’s contemporary defensive gun
culture, an evolution reflected in the content of gun advertisements.

Data and Methods
This study analyzes advertising in the second oldest general interest gun
magazine in the United States: Guns. The magazine has been continuously published
since 1955, currenly by FMG Publications in San Diego. It has a circulation of 74,333,
fewer than Handguns magazine (113,166) but more than Rifle Shooter (55,903), among
magazines that submit to audits by the Alliance for Audited Media. 2

Sampling
The sample of advertisements analyzed in this study comes from a single
randomly selected issue of Guns for each of the 65 years from 1955 through 2019. 3 We
used a random number generator set from 1 (January) to 12 (December) to determine
which of the 12 monthly issues to examine for each year. We then acquired the specified
issues either from the first author’s collection (for more recent issues), purchased them
through eBay or from FMG Publications (for older issues), or took advantage of FMG
Publications’ online archive of back issues.
Following Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane (2019b), to be included in the sample, an
advertisement had to meet three main criteria. First, the ad had to be at least one9

quarter of a page in size. Second, the ad had to be placed by the manufacturer, licensed
dealer, or importer of the product. Ads placed by comprehensive sporting goods stores
or gun stores were not coded unless the store was selling their own brand of product.
Third, the ad had to be for firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns, or a variety of gun
types), ammunition (but not separate parts of ammunition or reloading equipment),
gun accessories (products designed to be attached to or affect the utility of a firearm in
some way), or some combination of these products. These inclusion criteria resulted in a
total of 1,154 advertisements from 65 issues of Guns magazine.

Coding
Our content analysis began with 9 themes: technical superiority, hunting,
collecting, military, law enforcement, sport/recreation, tactical, personal protection/selfdefense/home or family defense, and concealed carry (Saylor, Vittes, and Sorenson
2004). After dropping advertisements that had none of these nine themes, we were left
with 950 advertisements.
Because our interest is in examining the shift from Gun Culture 1.0 to Gun
Culture 2.0, we focus here on just four of these themes, described in Table 1. Of these
four themes, hunting and sport shooting are reflective of the older Gun Culture 1.0, and
personal protection/self-defense/home or family defense and concealed carry are
reflective of the newer Gun Culture 2.0.

Table 1. Gun Magazine Advertisement Coding Scheme
CODE

CODE DEFINITION

Hunting

Product is associated with hunting, through images (e.g., owner in
hunting-related camo, animals in cross hairs) or text (e.g., “small
game”)

Sport/Recreation Product is promoted for informal recreational shooting (except
hunting), or linked to any of the various shooting sports, precision
rifle, clay target shooting, action shooting sports (3-gun, USPSA,
IPSC, IDPA), Olympic shooting, etc., through images (e.g., a shot
timer, clay pigeons, ) or text (e.g., “competition,” “plinking”).
Personal

Product is portrayed as an effective and/or important means of

Protection/Self-

home, family, and/or personal or self-protection, through images

Defense/Home

(e.g., confronting an assailant in a parking lot or alley, hiding

or Family

behind bed with gun) or text (e.g., “engineered to defend,”

Defense

“comfort runs in our family, so you can protect yours”).

Concealed

Product is portrayed as designed to facilitate the carrying of a

Carry

concealed firearm, through images (e.g., an inside the waistband
holster) or text (e.g., “IWB,” “carry more comfortably”).

11

Following Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane (2019b), we coded all themes present in each
advertisement as many reflected multiple themes. Hunting and sport shooting are often
found together, though are not identical. Likewise, many products coded for concealed
carry are also coded for personal protection/self-defense, but they too are distinct
categories.

Inter-coder Reliability Tests
As a test of the reliability of the coding scheme and instructions that were
developed, the three researchers coded the first 10 advertisements meeting the selection
criteria from the February 2017 issue of Guns magazine and the July 2016 issue of
American Rifleman, for a total of 20 advertisements. Researchers coded each ad for the
presence (=1) or absence (=0) of the attributes of interest. Krippendorf’s α (alpha) was
used to assess inter-coder reliability. According to Krippendorf (2013), it is customary to
require α ≥ .800 to conclude that the coding scheme and instructions are reliable. 4
As reported in Table 2, in the first round of testing, coding of 2 of the 4 attributes
resulted in satisfactory levels of inter-coder reliability: hunting (α=0.92) and concealed
carry (α=1.00). Coding of the other two attributes did not meet Krippendorf’s suggested
α ≥ .80: sport/recreation (α=0.52) and personal protection/self-defense/home or family
defense (α=0.64).

After a discussion of the application of the coding scheme and refinement of
code definitions, a second round of coding was undertaken, comparing three
researchers’ coding of 10 advertisements from the November 2013 issue of Guns
magazine and 10 advertisements from the May 2012 issue of The American Rifleman.
Although Krippendorf’s α increased for two attributes – Sport from 0.52 to 0.69 and
Personal Protection from from 0.64 to 0.86 – Sport remained below the acceptable level
of 0.80. In addition, Concealed Carry dropped from 1.00 to 0.64.
After further discussion and refinement of the coding definitions, a third round
of coding was undertaken, comparing three researchers’ coding of 10 advertisements
from the August 1966 issue of Guns magazine, 10 advertisements from the July 1969
issue of Guns magazine, and 20 advertisements from the December 1969 issue of The
American Rifleman. In the third round of testing, three of the four attributes of interest
13

had satisfactory levels of inter-coder reliability: Hunting (=0.90), Sport (=0.85), and
Concealed Carry (=1.00). Personal Protection dropped from round 2 to round 3, but was
very close to adequate still, with Krippendorf’s α = 0.79.
Further refinements led to a fourth round of coding of 12 advertisements in the
April 2000 issue of Guns and 13 advertisements in the October 2000 issue of The
American Rifleman. As shown in Table 2, all four attributes of interest had Krippendorf’s
α > 0.80, ranging from 0.81 for Personal Protection/Self-Defense/Home or Family
Defense to 0.85 for Hunting. At that point, trained researchers coded advertisements
independently, with the lead investigator spot-checking the results.

Analysis
Later issues of Guns magazine contain more advertisements than earlier issues.
The average number of ads for the 65 year period covered is 14.6/issue. The average for
the first five years (1955-1959) is 10/issue, peaking during Barak Obama’s first
presidential term at 26.8/issue (from 2010-2014), and declining back to 13.2/issue in the
most recent five years (2015-2019). Therefore, we normalize our results for each
individual year. Rather than giving each advertisement equal weight and calculating
the percentage of advertisements in each issue that reflect a particular theme, we
normalize the advertising content by looking at the proportion of all advertising space as
the denominator. We do this by recording and adding together the size of each ad that
14

meets our selection criteria for each issue (two, full, half, third, or quarter page). The
total coded advertising space averages 9.98 pages over the 65 years, and ranges from
1.99 pages in the March 1964 issue to 26.8 pages in the November 2013 issue.
We then multiply the presence of each coding theme in each advertisement by
the size of the ad. For example, a half page ad for a hunting rifle is 0.5, a one-third page
ad for a concealed carry holster is 0.33, and so on. Combing those products for each
advertisement in each issue then dividing them by the total coded advertising space
produces the percentage of total advertising space with that particular attribute. For
example, 6.65 advertising pages in the September 1970 issue included hunting as a
theme, out of 9.97 total advertising pages coded in that issue. So, 66.7% of all coded
advertising space in that issue of Guns included hunting as a theme.
This procedure not only controls for the increasing number of advertisements
over time, but also captures the reality that a full-page advertisement matters more than
a half-, third-, or quarter-page advertisement.

Results
Examining Gun Culture 1.0 themes of hunting and sport/recreational shooting
first, we see that these themes are present throughout the 65 years of advertising in
Guns magazine we analyzed. However, the relative proportion of all advertising space
coded that reflected these themes declined by 2019. The two themes did show different
15

patterns over the century examined. The red trend line in Figure 4 shows the pattern for
hunting. Similar to Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane (2019b), we find hunting as a theme in
gun advertising increased through the 1960s, and then declined the rest of the period
under study.

This increase in the presence of the hunting theme in Guns in the 1960s is likely
reflective of the strong interest in outdoor recreation in the broader culture during this
time period, including fishing, visiting National Parks, and RV camping (Wright, Rossi,
16

and Daly, 1983:53-55; Pergams and Zaradic, 2008). But even as these outdoor recreation
activities continued to grow through the 1970s, the representation of hunting in gun
advertising began declining, signaling a shift in the core of gun culture away from
hunting. These fluctuations also remind us of the importance of looking at the overall
trend (in red), and remembering that these trend lines only capture part of all of the
change (e.g., in Figure 4, R-square = 0.42).

In Figure 5, we see the sport and recreational shooting theme relatively stable as
a percentage of the total advertising space for most of the period under study, then
showing a pattern of steady decline in the last third. That said, the Gun Culture 1.0
themes of sport and recreational shooting continued to be an important part of
American gun culture even as it declined as a proportion of advertising we coded.
Taken together, hunting and sport and recreational shooting accounted for the majority
of advertising space coded through the end of the 20th century, even as the overall
pattern for both is one of decline (Figure 6).

As noted in the introduction, personal protection and home defense was already
a theme in some gun advertising in the late-19th and early-20th century. But ads drawing
on any of the themes in the broad category of personal protection/self-defense/home or
family defense were exceptional for the first half of the period under study here. As
shown in Figure 7, this Gun Culture 2.0 theme began to gain strength in the 1980s,
indicated by the green trendline edging upward from that point forward.

Not coincidentally, Florida’s landmark shall issue concealed carry legislation was
signed into law in 1987 (Grossman and Lee 2008, Steidley 2019a, Yamane 2019a).
Although Florida did not create shall issue concealed carry, it did open the floodgates
for a massive expansion in the number of states with liberalized concealed carry laws.
By 1990, a dozen states had laws favoring the right-to-carry concealed weapons by
ordinary citizens (Cramer and Kopel, 1994), and over the next six years, that number
more than doubled as another 16 states passed shall issue laws.

This dramatic liberalization of concealed-carry laws has led to a growing number
of Americans with concealed carry permits, thus creating a burgeoning market of
consumers hungry for commodities that promise to address the challenges of carrying a
sufficiently lethal weapon in public in a manner that is safe, accessible, comfortable, and
concealed (Yamane 2019a). This is reflected in the upward trend in advertising drawing
on the concealed carry theme shown in Figure 8. This theme reveals a pattern similar to
that of personal protection/self-defense, but with a slightly delayed onset and slightly
steeper increase in the trend.
To return to the questions posed at the outset, then, has the core of American gun
culture shifted from hunting and sport shooting to personal protection/self-/home and
family defense and concealed carry? As measured through gun advertising, we
conclude yes. Gun Culture 1.0 themes are found in a declining proportion of
advertisements in Guns magazine over the past 65 years, and Gun Culture 2.0 themes
are increasing.
Although their trajectories are converging, have Gun Culture 2.0 themes
overtaken Gun Culture 1.0 themes in advertising? To answer this question, we
combined the proportion of ads with the hunting and sport/recreational shooting
themes, and the proportion of ads with the personal protection/self-/home and family
defense and concealed carry themes. We then plotted those two trends together on the
same graph. Figure 9 shows the convergence of the trend lines for these two themes
21

from the 1970s forward, their meeting between 2010 and 2011, and divergence
thereafter, with Gun Culture 2.0 themes superseding Gun Culture 1.0 themes. Looking
at the underlying data, from 2014 to 2019, the average annual coded advertising space
reflecting Gun Culture 2.0 themes was 56.5% (range = 49.6% to 68.7%) while only 14.2%
on average reflected Gun Culture 1.0 themes (range = 0% to 25%).

Conclusion
This systematic content analysis of gun advertising in Guns magazine was
designed to replicate and test Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane’s (2019b) study documenting
a shift in the core emphasis of US gun culture from hunting and recreational shooting to
armed self-defense. The data show that the predominance of Gun Culture 1.0 themes in
advertising persists through the 1980s and into the 1990s, when the center of gravity of
gun culture begins to shift decisively toward the Gun Culture 2.0 themes of personal
protection/self-defense and concealed carry. This trend continues through the 1990s and
2000s, with the two emphases crossing-over in the 2010s. As reflected in advertising, in
addition to other indicators such as self-reported reasons for gun ownership, Gun
Culture 2.0 is now America’s dominant and still expanding core gun culture today.
Like Yamane, Ivory, and Yamane (2019b), this replication study is not without
shortcomings. First, we use the content of gun advertising as an indicator of cultural
change over time. Like other students of advertising, we cannot answer the question of
whether advertising is a “mirror” reflecting culture or a “mold” influencing it (Eisend
2010). The most likely answer is that the causal arrow is two-headed and the process is
iterative, but to conclude this with certainty requires an independent measure of social
change which is hard to come by over the long period under study here.
A second and related limitation is that a comprehensive understanding of culture
– including advertising – requires understanding not only the production or “encoding”
23

of culture as analyzed here. It also requires understanding the reception or “decoding”
of culture (Hall 1980). Here, a photo elicitation interview methodology would be a
productive approach to tapping into the thoughts, meanings, and emotions consumers
attach to particular advertisements (Harper 2002, cf. Harcourt 2006).
Third, more subtle, qualitative analyses of these changing themes would add
flesh to the skeleton of trend data we have constructed here. For example, Dawson
(2019) has recently explored the sacralization of the Second Amendment by the
National Rifle Assocation. It is possible that the same process is reflected in gun
advertising. Anecdotally, we have seen the gun manufacturer Springfield Armory
advertising an AR-platform rifle called “The Saint.” In addition, Carlson (2015), Metzl
(2019), and Stroud (2016) all highlight the importance of class, race, and/or gender
dynamics in contemporary gun culture. The existing literature on race and gender
imagery in advertising (Coltrane and Messineo, 2000), therefore, could be profitably
applied to gun advertising. In fact, the senior author of this paper is currently applying
Erving Goffman’s (1979) gender advertisements perspective to gun advertisements to
assess the extent to which gender displays in advertising have changed over the past
100 years (cf. Belknap and Leonard, 1991; Kang, 1997).
Finally, it is important to recognize that being a part of gun culture is not simply
about holding a particular set of beliefs. According to Stebbins (2001, p. 54), “Serious
leisure participants typically become members of a vast social world, a complex mosaic
24

of groups, events, networks, organizations, and social relationships.” The same is true
for participants in both recreational and defensive gun culture. America is not just a
“Gun Show Nation,” to use Burbick’s (2007) famous phrase, it is a nation of gun clubs,
training classes, shooting events, network meet-ups, gun collectors and shooters
associations. Kohn (2004) approaches gun culture this way in Shooters, but more solidly
ethnographic work like hers is necessary. Going forward, further attention should be
paid especially to the social organization of armed citizenship and concealed carry,
building on Carlson’s (2015) fine work, as well as the complex personal dynamics of
becoming a gun carrier, following in Stroud’s (2016) and Shapira and Simon’s (2018)
footsteps.
As Yamane (2017) has argued, social institutions – including the legal system,
economy, and technology – shape American gun culture. These institutions require
greater attention, as well. For example, the passage of shall-issue concealed carry laws
facilitates the widespread practice of legally carrying guns in public. The growing
practice of concealed carry also creates a number of new challenges for the individuals
who do so, as well as for the broader social worlds (other people, spaces, places) in
which they do so. The developing culture of armed citizenship addresses these
challenges both through the “hardware” of material culture like guns, accessories, and
other products, and the “software” of ways of thinking, legal frameworks, and the

25

development of relevant abilities. Gun studies scholars are encouraged to study these
aspects of Gun Culture 2.0 going forward.
