Abstract
We use novel data on police-involved deaths to estimate how the risk of
being killed by police use-of-force in the United States varies across social
groups. We estimate the lifetime and age-specific risks of being killed
by police by race and sex. We also provide estimates of the proportion
of all deaths accounted for by police use-of-force. We find that African
American men and women, American Indian / Alaska Native men and
women, and Latino men face higher lifetime risk of being killed by police
than do their white peers. We find that Latino women and Asian / Pacific
Islander men and women face lower risk of being killed by police than do
their white peers. Risk is highest for Black men, who (at current levels of
risk) face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the life
course. The average lifetime odds of being killed by police are about 1 in
2,000 for men and about 1 in 33,000 for women. Risk peaks between the
ages of 20 and 35 for all groups. For young men of color, police use-of-force
is among the leading causes of death.

Violent encounters with the police have profound effects on health, neighborhoods, life chances, and politics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Policing plays a
key role in maintaining structural inequalities between between people of color
and white people in the United States [1, 10]. The killings of Oscar Grant,
Michael Brown, Charleena Lyles, Stephon Clark, Tamir Rice, among many others, and the protests that followed have brought sustained national attention to
the racialized character of police violence against civilians [11]. Social scientists
1

and public health scholars now widely acknowledge that police contact is a key
vector of health inequality [6, 3], and is an important cause of early mortality
for people of color [12].
Police in The U.S. kill far more people than do police in other advanced
industrial democracies [13]. While a substantial body of evidence shows that
people of color, especially African Americans, are at greater risk for experiencing
criminal justice contact and police-involved harm than are whites [14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19], we lack basic estimates of the prevalence of police-involved deaths,
largely due to the absence of definitive official data. Journalists have stepped
into this void and initiated a series of systematic efforts to track police-involved
killings. These novel data enable a richer understanding of the geographic and
demographic patterning of police violence [17] and an evaluation of the magnitude of exposure to police violence over the life course.
Prior research has clearly established that race, sex, and age are closely
correlated with exposure to the criminal justice system [20, 21, 22]. Age, race,
and gender are also central to the logics that police and legal systems use to
decide who to target, how to intervene, and how much force should be applied
in the process of policing [23, 24, 5, 25, 26].

Research Strategy and Key Findings
This paper provides descriptive estimates of the national prevalence of fatal
police violence. In doing so, we contribute to a body of research that uses
demographic methods to systematically describe the depth of the involvement
of the criminal justice system in the lives of Americans [27, 28, 22, 29, 30].
We estimate the risk of being killed by police use-of-force in the United
States by age, race, and sex. We also construct period life tables [31] that
provide estimates of the risk of death across the life course, with the central
assumption that risk profiles observed between 2013 and 2018 remain stable. We
use Bayesian simulation and multilevel models to provide uncertainty intervals
for our mortality estimates.
Our results show that people of color face a higher likelihood of being killed
by police than do white men and women, that risk peaks in young adulthood,
and that men of color face a non-trivial lifetime risk of being killed by police.
Focal measures for this analysis rely on data compiled by Fatal Encounters
(FE), a journalist-led effort to document deaths involving police. Cases are
identified through public records and news coverage, and each variable in the
data is validated against published documents. Unofficial media-based methods
provide more comprehensive information on police violence than do the limited
official data currently available [32, 33, 4].
We focus exclusively on police use-of-force deaths, and exclude cases from the
analysis that police described as a suicide, that involved a vehicular collision, or
that involved an accident such as an overdose or a fall. We provide sensitivity
analyses that explore the impact of these inclusion criteria in Figure S12 in
the supplementary materials. Mortality rate estimates for all groups increase
substantially when all recorded cases are included in the analysis.

and 2017 National Vital Statistics System Data.
We describe the data and methods, their limitations, and their assumptions
in more detail in the methods and materials section below and in the supplementary materials.

Results
Figure 1 displays estimates of lifetime risk of being killed by police use-of-force
by race and sex, using data from 2013 - 2018. We estimate that over the life
course, at levels of risk similar to those observed betweeen 2013 and 2018, about
52 [39, 68] (90 percent uncertainty interval) of every 100,000 men and boys in
the United States will be killed by police use of force over the life course, and
about 3 [1.5, 4.5] of every 100,000 women and girls will be killed by police over
the life course.
Figure 2 displays the ratio of lifetime risk for each racial / ethnic group
relative to white risk for both men and women. Note that a rate ratio of one
indicates equality in mortality risk relative to whites. The highest levels of
inequality in mortality risk are experienced by Black men. Black men are about
2.5 times more likely to be killed by police over the life course than are white
men. Black women are about 1.4 times more likely to be killed by police than
are white women. Though risks are estimated with less precision for American
Indian / Alaska Native men and women than for other groups, we show that they
face a higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than do whites. American
Indian men are between 1.2 and 1.7 times more likely to be killed by police than
white men, and American Indian women are between 1.1 and 2.1 times more
likely to be killed by police than are white women. Latino men are between

1.3 and 1.4 times more likely to be killed by police than are white men, but
Latina women are between 12 and 23 percent less likely to be killed by police
than are white women. Both Asian/Pacific Islander men and women are more
than 50 percent less likely to be killed by police than are white men and women
respectively.
Among all groups, Black men and boys face the highest lifetime risk of being
killed by police. Our models predict that about 1 in 1,000 Black men and boys
will be killed by police over the life course (96 [77, 120] per 100,000). We
predict that between 36 and 81 American Indian / Alaska Native men and boys
per 100,000 will be killed by police over the life course. Latino men and boys
have an estimated risk of being killed by police of about 53 per 100,000 [41, 67].
Asian / Pacific Islander men and boys face a lifetime risk of between 9 and 23
per 100,000, while white men and boys face a lifetime risk of about 39 [31, 48]
per 100,000.
Women’s lifetime risk of being killed by police is about 20 times lower than
men’s risk. Anong women and girls, Black women and American Indian / Alaska
Native women’s risk is highest; we expect between 2.4 and 5.4 Black women
and girls to be killed by police over the lifecourse per 100,000 at current rates.
American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls are killed by police over the
life course at a rate of about 4.2 per 100,000 [1.8, 8.5]. Latina and white women
and girls have similar lifetime mortality risks, at about 2 per 100,000. Asian /
Pacific Islander women and girls are at the lowest risk of being killed by police
for all groups, with a lifetime risk of about 0.6 [0.2, 1.5] per 100,000. However,
when other causes of fatality are included in risk estimates, particularly vehiclerelated deaths, risk estimates more than double for women across all racial and
ethnic groups. We show estimates of lifetime risk at 2013 - 2018 mortality risk
levels for multiple causes of police-involved death in Appendix Figure S12.
Figure 3 displays male age-specific rates of death by police use-of-force by
race/ethnicity, and Figure 4 displays female age-specific rates of being killed by
police by race/ethnicity and age. Risk for all groups peaks between the ages of
20 and 35 and declines with age. This pattern is similar to the distribution of
violent crime.
Between the ages of 25 and 29, Black men are killed by police at a rate
between 2.8 and 4.1 per 100,000. American Indian and Alaska Native men are
killed at a rate between 1.5 and 2.8 per 100,000; Asian/Pacific Islander men are
killed by police at a rate between 0.3 and 0.6 per 100,000, Latino men at a rate
between 1.4 and 2.2 per 100,000, and white men at a rate between 0.9 and 1.4
per 100,000. Inequalities in risk persist throughout the life course.
We estimate an overall mortality rate of about 1.8 per 100,000 for men
between the ages of 25 and 29. This ranks police use-of-force as one of the
leading causes of death for young men. Between these ages, police violence
trails accidents (which include drug overdoses, motor vehicle traffic deaths, and
other accidental fatalities) at 76.6 deaths per 100,000, suicide (26.7 per 100,000),
other homicides (22.0 per 100,000), heart disease (7.0 per 100,000), and cancer
(6.3 per 100,000) as a leading cause of death.
Women’s risk of being killed by police use-of-force is about an order of mag6

nitude lower than men’s risk at all ages, as shown in Figure 4. Between 25 and
29, we estimate a median mortality risk of 0.12 per 100,000 for Black women,
a risk of 0.14 for American Indian / Alaska Native women, 0.02 for Asian /
Pacific Islander women, 0.07 for Latina women, 0.07 for white women, and an
overall mortality risk of 0.08 per 100,000 for women between the ages of 25 and
29. Police use-of-force is not among the 15 leading causes of death for young
women.
Figure 5 displays the ratio of police use-of-force deaths to all deaths by age,
sex, and race. Police use-of-force accounts for 0.05 percent of all male deaths in
the US, and 0.003 percent of all Female deaths, a low overall share. However,
this ratio is strongly correlated with age and race and is starkly unequal across
racial groups. Police use-of-force is responsible for 1.6 percent of all deaths
involving Black men between the ages of 20 and 24. At this age, police are
responsible for 1.2 percent of American Indian / Alaska Native male deaths,
0.5 percent of Asian / Pacific Islander male deaths, 1.2 percent of Latino male
deaths, and 0.5 percent of white male deaths. For women between the ages of
20 and 24, police use-of-force is responsible for 0.2 percent of all deaths of Black
women, 0.2 percent of all deaths of American Indian / Alaska Native women,
0.05 percent of all deaths of Asian / Pacific Islander women, 0.16 percent of all
deaths of Latina women, and 0.11 percent of all deaths of white women.

Discussion
Our analysis shows that the risk of being killed by police is jointly patterned
by one’s race, gender, and age. Police violence is a leading cause of death for
young men, and young men of color face exceptionally high risk of being killed by
police. Inequalities in risk are pronounced throughout the life course. This study
reinforces calls to treat police violence as a public health issue [4, 1]. Racially
unequal exposure to the risk of state violence has profound consequences for
public health, democracy, and racial stratification [7, 9, 8, 11, 5].
Results should be interpreted with several considerations in mind. While the
methods used in this paper allow for nationally precise age, race, and genderspecific mortality estimates, they may mask important subnational variation
and changes in risk over time [17, 34]. Because our analysis focuses on some
groups that have low age-specific risks, we lack the power to closely consider
spatial and temporal trends. However, in appendix Figure S3 we show that
rates of death have increased by as much as 50 percent since 2008. Also note
that while Black people remain disproportionately more likely than white people
to be killed by police, the share of white deaths has been increasing in recent
years (see Figure S5). Our approach smooths over these changes by treating
year effects as random error, but future research should examine these trends
closely. Prior research suggests that despite high contemporary rates, the risk
of being killed by police was higher in decades past [35].
FE relies on photographs and victim obituaries to classify the race/ethnicity
of victims. FE does not currently collect data on variables that may be associated with variation in risk within racial/ethnic groups such as skin tone,
7

multi-racial identity, or social class [36]. We discuss FE’s methodology and
compare FE’s racial data to other sources of data in the appendix (see Figures
S5 and S7). The meaning of race, age, and gender for police violence emerges
in the interactions between how officers perceive an individual’s identity and
the salience of these classifications for perceptions of criminality, belonging, and
dangerousness [1, 37, 10, 25]. Future work should closely consider how place,
race, gender, age, social class, and disability intersectionally structure exposure
to violence [26].
The absence of authoritative official data is a key challenge in reducing police violence. The Bureau of Justice Statistics should renew efforts to develop
comprehensive systems to track officer involved deaths [4, 38]. Both the public
interest and social science are served by increasing transparency with regard to
police use-of-force. Using such data, the research community has made strides
in identifying officers most at-risk of being involved in cases of excessive force
[39] and system failures that result in civilian deaths [40].
While our research does not evaluate the effects of policy, we believe that
several avenues of reform may be fruitful in reducing rates of death. Austerity in social welfare and public health programs have led to police and prisons
becoming catch-all responses to social problems [41, 42]. Adequately funding
community-based services and restricting the use of armed officers as first responders to mental health and other forms of crisis would likely reduce the
volume of people killed by police [42]. Increasing the ability of the public to
engage in the regulation of policing through both investigatory commissions
with disciplinary teeth and through equal participation in police union contract
negotiations would also likely reduce rates of death [43].

Materials and Methods
Our analysis relies on a combination of official and unofficial sources of mortality
data; Fatal Encounters (FE) and the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).
FE collects data on all deaths involving police through systematic searches of
online news coverage, public records, and social media. FE provides more comprehensive data on police-involved deaths than do official mortality files [33],
has a broader scope than similar unofficial efforts to document deaths, and has
been endorsed as a sound source of data by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
[44]. Despite the relatively high quality of FE, because the data rely on media
reports, counts of deaths are likely negatively biased. If any death is not covered
by news organizations or is not documented in searchable public records, it will
not appear in the data.
Between 2013 and 2018, about 9 percent of FE cases are missing data on race
/ ethnicity (see Table S1). We use multiple imputation by chained equations
[45] to address missing data for observations between 2013 and 2018. Imputation models include victim age, sex, race, cause of death, and the racial / ethnic
composition of the county in which a death occurred. We also include surnamespecific estimates of the probability of racial / ethnic group identification on

8

the US Census compiled by Imai and Khanna [46]. Results yield similar case
compositions as those we observe in NVSS and FE data, as shown in appendix
Figure S7. Listwise deletion of missing cases unrealistically understates uncertainty in our parameter estimates and negatively biases mortality risk estimates
(see appendix Figure S8).
We use these imputed data to construct multilevel Bayesian count models
of mortality risk that allow us to directly estimate uncertainty driven by small
annual age-race-sex specific death counts for some groups, by variation in underlying risk over the 6 years of FE data, and by missing data. Intervals reported
in the text are drawn from model posterior predictive distributions.
Because we lack sufficient data to track a birth cohort over the life course,
we rely on synthetic cohorts to estimate lifetime risk [31]. Period life tables
allow us to estimate deaths over the life course within a compressed period of
time by tracking age-specific mortality risk over hypothetical cohorts in each
sub-group with the key assumption that underlying age-specific mortality risks
remain constant at observed levels throughout the life course. All risk estimates
presented in this paper can be interpreted as estimates of age-specific or cumulative lifetime risk at 2013 - 2018 police use-of-force mortality rates and 2017
total mortality rates. Our methods are described in more detail in the supplemental materials, and an excerpt of our multiple-decrement period life table is
displayed in Table S4.
A replication package containing all scripts and data used in this analysis are
available through an Open Science Framework project repository (https://osf.io/c8qxh/).
