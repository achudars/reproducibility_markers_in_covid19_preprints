"6" "Abstract"
"7" "This paper uses data covering birth cohorts between 1 900 -1950 in the US to examine correlations between schooling between fathers and sons across time and place of birth.   Using CPS data with special modules that capture parental education, findings suggest  gradual increases  in  educational  mobility  across the first five decades of the 20 th  century.   There is also geographic (regional) variation that is both large and persistent, with areas of the South showing educational transmission rates that are twice as high as areas in the Northeast."
"8" "Ongoing  work  that  harmonize s  these findings with the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data and newer birth cohorts from NCES databases (High School & Beyond, NELS, ELS)  suggests larger reductions in immobility as the century unfolds ."
"9" "Introduction  and Background"
"10" "Estimating and understanding the high levels of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status has preoccupied researchers across multiple disciplines, including economics, sociology, demography, and others.  The early  economics  literature, summarized and discussed in Solon (1999) focused  primarily  on examining income/earnings correlations and issues of measurement and interpretation .  Black and Deveraux (2011 ) have recently extended this summary and included new issues and outcomes in this literature that have appeared in the last decade.  In particular, they describe the shifting focus to education and health outcomes,  the use of  new data from outside the US, and methods that attempt to focus on mechanisms."
"11" "Several stylized facts have been produced in the last decade in describing patterns of  intergenerational transmission, however the literature that explores temporal and/or spatial variation in educational mobility is relatively limited.  Chevalier et al. (2009) take a cross-country approach to the topic and use the International Adult Literacy Survey administered in 21 countries between 1994-98 for individuals aged 25-65 (i.e. birth cohorts between approximately 1930-1970).  The mobility coefficient for the US is approximately  0.36 in their data, which places the mobility in the middle of the countries, with Switzerland closer to 0.2 and Germany above 0.5."
"12" "Related to the emerging literature that focuses on temporal/spatial aspects of intergenerational mobility processes,  Chetty  et al. (2014 a,b )  has  used millions of observations from IRS tax records to show that, for the birth cohorts from around 1970  to present, the intergenerational correlation in income has been surprisingly stable and that there is substantial geographic variation in intergenerational  income  mobility."
"13" "This paper  builds on these emerging findings by exploring temporal and spatial patterns in education mobility in the US for the last 100 years by combining over 10 datasets.  The current version of the paper focuses on a single dataset, the Current Population Survey-Occupational Changes  in a Generation  (CPS-OCG) data, which includes information from birth c ohorts between around 1895-1945,  thus allowing a novel examination of temporal and regional trends in education mobility between fathers and sons.   An exploration of links between fathers’ occupational status and daughter (vs. sons) educational attainment is also presented."
"14" "Initial findings on the sample of sons with state-of-birth information available suggest that intergenerational links between fathers and  sons  educational attainment fell during the first half of the 20 th  century by close to 20%, though the magnitude of the link suggests continued educational immobility, especially compared to more contemporary birth cohorts in the US.  A second key finding is of stark regional differences in education mobility, with the South much less mobile than the rest of the country, coupled with some suggestion of convergence over time."
"15" "Research Design, Methods and Data"
"16" "Data"
"17" "This paper use s  the CPS 1962 and 1973 years, which contain the OCG (Occupational Changes in a Generation) data from Peter  Blau  and Otis Dudley Duncan.  These data include over 50,000 males born between 1887-1950.   Important for the  project is the OCG module information of reported father’s education level  from the main respondents (sons) .    Finally, state of birth information is available for the main respondents, which will allow educational mobility measures between their parents and themselves to be estimated separately by state and year of birth to examine trends and geographic variation.   The current analysis focuses on census region rather than state , with an exploration showing that using  nine Census Divisions  instead of  four Census R egion s  does not change the main results ."
"18" "Table 1 presents summary statistics for t he full sample.  Appendix Table  A1 disaggregates the  descriptives  based on census region or decade of birth.   As expected, respondents in the South have lower educational attainment than other regions (both sons and fathers) and the level of schooling has increased substantially over the 50 years of birth cohorts, from 9.3 years for those born around the turn of the century to 12.5 years for those born closer to mid-century (about a 0.85 of a standard deviation increase from the baseline level)."
"19" "Research Design"
"20" "The literature examining the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status typically utilizes a straightforward baseline empirical model:"
"21" "(1) where  represents the child’s outcome and  represents the parent’s outcome.  If  measures permanent earnings,  than   is an estimate of the intergenerational elasticity (IGE) and (1-  ) is a measure of intergenerational mobility.    Although there are important measurement issues in this baseline model when the focus is on earnings  (single vs. multiple measure of income, the ages of each generation, shocks to earnings) (Sol on 1999, Black and Devereux 2011 ,  Mazumdar  2015 ), these issues are less problematic for education outcomes."
"22" "The preliminary results in this paper use a similar basic OLS estimator that regresses years of education (son) on years of education (father) plus some basic demographic controls variables, such as age and race (recall that the sample is all male).  Future iterations of the analysis will estimate transition matrices and  non -linear  regression  models.  I stratify these basic regressions by census region and birth decade to explore trends and spatial variation in the mobility estimates."
"23" "Preliminary Results"
"24" "Using the sample of males with non-missing parental education measures who are at least 25 years old at  the time of the survey, Table 2  presents descriptive regression analysis linking father’s years of schooling with son’s years of schooling (controlling for birth year (linearly) and race of the son).  Column 1 shows the father-son association for the full sample , which like most work on more recent samples is approximat ely  0.34 , which lies in the upper part of the range of education mobility estimates reported by Mulligan (1999)  (range 0.14-0.45, average 0.29)  but is  essentially the same as  the USA estimate in Chevalier et al. (2009)  that uses different data ."
"25" "I next stratify the results by decade of birth to examine potential  temporal  trends in mobility across five decades.  Results in columns 2 -6 indeed suggest more than an 18  percent decline in immobility over time.  A pooled regression in Table 2A in the appendix suggests statistically significant differences in mobility starting around 1920  (compared with 1900) that then further expands by 1940.  Table 2 also shows the magnitude of the black-white difference  in schooling over the period (an initial  3 year  difference  that shrinks to  a 0. 6 5 year difference)."
"26" "Table 3 begins an examination of regional differences in educational mobility.  As expected, I find substantially higher immobility in the South —nearly twice the level of the Northeast region .   These regional analyses are further extended in Table 4, where I estimate decade-differences for each region separately.   By the last decade in the analysis, each region has experienced relatively substantial reductions in immobility, though the West and South start with much higher immobility .  Figure 1 also shows some visual evidence of convergence in mobility across time."
"27" "Intergenerational Mobility for Sons vs. Daughters"
"28" "Unfortunately, the CPS-OCG data did not collect father’s educational attainment for women ( i.e.  wives in CPS households).  Instead the data include measures of the main respondent’s father-in-law’s occupational status  (socioeconomic index, SEI), which is a composite of occupation-level measures of educational attainment and income.  Since the CPS-OCG collects the SEI information from both husband and wife in  each  CPS household, I can compare father-son to father-daughter statistical associations between SEI and educational attainment of the children’s generation.   Table 5 presents the results by birth decade and suggests a greater link between father and sons (i.e. higher immobility) but that each of the links is reduced over the period by  approximately 35% for males and 30% for females, though the latter happens gradually while the former is more persistent until the final decade of birth years.  Figure 2 plots the coefficients by birth decade and region.  Again, we see the South with higher levels of immobility  but also some evidence of converge over time for both genders."
"29" "Conclusions"
"30" "This preliminary draft provides a first exploration of regional and decadal trends in education mobility in the early 20 th  Century US.    A first finding is of reductions in immobility over the time period of about 20%.  A second find is stark regional differences in immobility, with the South the least mobile region, but also some evidence of modest convergence over time, especially as the time period approaches the middle of the 20 th  century of birth cohorts.  A third finding is of gender-differences in the relationships between father’s occupational status and  son’s  vs. daughter’s educational attainment.  I find a greater link during the whole period between father’s and son’s but also important regional differences, where father’s- daughter’s  have a stronger association in the South than do father/sons in the Northeast.  A few next steps are worth noting.  A first examination will be of black-white differences in these processes.  A second examination will begin to link population and policy characteristics at the state-level over this period to these processes.  A third step will be to link these findings with findings from other datasets that cover complementary birth cohorts."
