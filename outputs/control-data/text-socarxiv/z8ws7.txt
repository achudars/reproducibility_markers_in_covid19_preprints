Abstract
This research is to measure the effect of focused and unfocused feedback on second language
(L2) learners’ writing accuracy with involving gender and learners’ cultural background factors.
The study applied a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. The participants were 128 learners
at IAIN Palangka Raya, Indonesia. During the learning process, the first treatment group was
treated using Focused Direct Feedback; the second treatment group was treated using Unfocused
Direct Feedback, and the control group was not given any treatments or No Feedback. Data were
analyzed using a three-way ANOVA analyses. The analysis confirmed that the focused direct of
feedback gave a facilitative effect on the learners’ writing accuracy. In terms of gender, the
learners' writing accuracy differed significantly different between males and female. In terms of
cultural background, the learners’ writing accuracy did not differ significantly among each
ethnics. There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by
gender and the types of corrective feedback factors. There were no differences significantly on
the learners’ writing accuracy caused by cultural background and types of corrective feedback
factors. There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by
gender and cultural background factors. There were no differences significantly on the learners’
writing accuracy caused by gender, cultural background the types of corrective feedback factors.
To conclude, it was noted that gender and different types of feedback had a vital thing in
increasing learners’ writing accuracy. Corrective feedback was important for both the teachers
and learners in L2 writing class.

Introduction
During many years, Written Corrective Feedback has been observed from different views. In the
perspective of the behaviorist approach of the 1950s and 1960s, errors were regarded as nonlearning and they ought to be corrected. Historically, giving corrective feedback is seen from
various perspectives. In 1996, Truscott argued that feedback should be avoided. His response was
intended to Ferris (1999) who disagreed to Truscott's claims. Since then, some researchers
investigated on written feedback. In the perspective of the behaviorist approach, errors are
considered as the result of non-learning and must be corrected. In line with this, Bitchener & Ferris
(2012) state that errors were perceived much more negatively than today’s education. Behaviorists
assumed that errors should be corrected strictly and systematically.
Being able to write an essay has been considered as an urgent skill at an Essay Writing
class. Writing can be a hard task for learners in the classroom (Wessels, & Herrera, 2014). The
2015 syllabus for English Study Program at IAIN Palangka Raya stated that the learners were
designed to be able to write an essay about 450-500 words. Since some researchers have found
feedback to have positive and, a few of them, negative effects on L2 writing, it is important to
explore it and how feedback gives effect on the learners' writing performance. To develop learners’
writing skills, written feedback as a teaching tool has been discussed extensively in the teacher
training college. Although it may seem like something solely positive, the topic is quite
controversial; and when implementing it in writing classroom setting there are questions to be
asked. For example, does the written corrective feedback give a facilitative effect or not for the
students? the answer to that particular question does not come easily. Over the years, experts have
measured the effects of feedback on L2 writers with different results. This is one of the reasons for
the researcher to measure the effect of feedback regarding gender and learners’ cultural
background.
Researches on the impact of feedback have been conducted by some researchers. For
example, Saeb (2014) measuring the influence of focused and unfocused feedback for L2
beginners found that focused and unfocused feedback groups gave a facilitative effect on learners'
writing accuracy for both experimental classes. However, the focused and unfocused groups did
not differ significantly. Meanwhile, Sonja (2013) confirms that focused feedback was useful in
developing writing accuracy. Next, Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, & Takashima (2008) found that the
feedback gave effect for focused and unfocused class. Then, Sheen, Wright, & Moldawa (2009)
measuring the effects of the focused and unfocused approaches, found that focused feedback
contributed to grammatical accuracy. All results indicated that focused and unfocused feedback
was useful in writing’ accuracy. In the current study, Focused Direct Feedback (FDF) was
operationalized as (1) showing the error location by crossing the errors of a linguistic error (for
example observing pronoun agreement for the first writing product, examining verb agreement for
the second writing product, and examining singular plural forms for the third writing product) and
(2) giving the appropriate forms.
Unfocused feedback is the model of feedback in which all learners’ linguistic errors are
corrected by language instructors (Ellis et al., 2008; Ellis, 2009). Unfocused feedback involves
giving feedback on all errors. Here, the feedback was given on all language forms. In the current
study, Un-focused Direct Feedback (UDF) was operationalized as (1) indicating the error location

on all linguistic errors made by the learners; (2) giving the appropriate forms for all errors. Thus,
it involved giving feedback on all errors.
The other factor for successful learning in an L2 writing class is the learners’ cultural
background. Hyland (2003) states that cultural factors are reasons for writing differences. Cultural
factors formed students' background insights and it influenced their writing performance. In
addition, Made & Fitriati (2017) state that cultural aspect constraints appeared more frequently.
Indonesia is a multicultural country. It automatically makes Indonesia becoming a multilingual
country. In Indonesia, each culture has its own language and dialect. According to Brown (2007),
culture is a way of life. In the present study, there are only three ethnic cultural backgrounds being
discussed: Javanese, Banjarese, and Dayaknese. In my opinion, the students cultural background
makes the writing differences and can influence the way of the appropriate feedback. Teachers and
students from different cultures may misunderstand their communication in the writing process,
which causes ineffective feedback.
Different from all studies above, this research emphasizes on measuring the influence of
focused and unfocused direct feedback with involving different gender and learners’ cultural
background as potential factors for successful learning. The novelty of this study is that the
learners’ gender and cultural background were taken into consideration for deeper analyzing data.
The purpose was to measure the effect of focused and unfocused direct feedback by considering
gender factors: male and female; and cultural background factors: Dayak, Banjarese, and Javanese.
Therefore, the research problems: (RQ1) Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ significantly
caused by types of corrective feedback factor? (RQ2) Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ
significantly caused by gender factor? (RQ3) Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ
significantly caused by cultural background factor? (RQ4) Does the learners’ writing accuracy
differ significantly caused by the gender and types of feedback factors? (RQ5) Does the learners’
writing accuracy differ significantly caused by the learners’ cultural background and types of
feedback factors? (RQ6) Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ significantly caused by gender
and cultural background factors? (RQ7) Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ significantly
caused by gender, learners’ cultural background and types of feedback factors?
Method
This part covered the research method, design, participants, procedures, and analysis of data. The
design applied a pretest-posttest quasi-experiment. Participants were 128 L2 learners at IAIN
Palangka Raya of 2018/ 2019 academic years. The participants were assigned randomly into two
groups based on gender (male 56 and female 72), and three groups based on their cultural
background: (Dayaknese 38, Banjarese 42, and Javanese 48). They were also clustered into three
groups consisting of two experimental classes: the first treatment class (n=44), the second
treatment class (n=41), and one control class (n=43). The distribution of the participants was
described in this table 1.

Procedures
The entire study was spread over one semester in writing essay class. Each meeting was done a
week for 16 meetings. At the early beginning, all participants were given pretest to observe the
existing ability in writing an essay. During the class, the treatment group 1 was given treatment
using Focused Direct Feedback (FDF). Here, the teacher provided the feedback by (1) identifying
the errors by crossing the errors of a linguistic error (for example observing pronoun agreement
for the first writing product, examining verb agreement for the second writing product, and
examining singular plural forms for the third writing product) and (2) giving the appropriate forms.
Then, the treatment group 2 was given treatment using Unfocused Direct Feedback (UDF). Here,
the teacher provided all linguistic errors made by the learners. It involved giving feedback on all
errors. On the contrary, the control group was not given any treatments. The teacher assigned the
participants to write an essay. Then, the teacher handed the participants' writing to be assessed
without providing feedback or No Feedback (NF). At the last session, all participants were given
a writing posttest. They should write an essay about 450-500 words. The students’ composition
was scored using the scoring method as developed by Weigle (2002,) and scoring standard of IAIN
Palangka Raya (2011, p. 15). It was done to produce the right criteria to score the idea development
aspects of students’ essay writing.
Data Analysis
The hypotheses of null are: (a) the population mean of writing score did not differ due to the types
of corrective feedback factor; (b) the population mean of writing score did not differ due to the
gender factor; (c) the population mean of writing score did not differ due to the learners’ cultural
background factor; (d) the gender and types of feedback factors did not give interaction effect in
the population mean of writing score; (e) the learners’ cultural background and types of feedback
factors did not give interaction effect in the population mean of writing score; (f) the gender and
learners’ cultural background factors did not give interaction effect in the population mean of
writing score; and (g) gender, learners’ cultural background and types of feedback factors did not
give interaction effect in the population mean of writing score. Responding to the seven research
questions; a three-way ANOVA test was applied. It is used to measure the interaction effect
between three independent variables toward a dependent variable. Here, there were three
categorical independent variables being investigated, namely: gender (male-female), learners’
cultural background (Dayaknese, Banjarese, and Javanese), and types of feedback (Focused and
Unfocused Direct Feedback); and one dependent variable: learners’ writing score. The scores of
the three groups were analyzed with a three-way ANOVA and the outcomes were compared to see
the interaction effect of independent variables (focused and unfocused feedback) on the learners’
writing accuracy with involving gender factors (male and female), learners’ cultural background
(Dayaknese, Banjarese, and Javanese). All statistical procedures were calculated using SPSS
software (version 16).

Results
Before testing the hypotheses, the normality and homogeneity tests, as required in ANOVA test
assumption, were conducted. As a result of Shapiro-Wilk statistic, the sig. value (p- value) for each
category for Dayaknese FDF male (p=0.893), female (p=0.987); for Banjarese FDF male
(p=0.980), female (p=0.875); for Javanese FDF male (p=0.604), female (p=0.687); for Dayaknese
UDF male (p=0.167), female (p=0.421); for Banjarese UDF male (p=0.106), female (p=0.930);
for Javanese UDF male (p=0.071), female (p=0.410). Meanwhile, Dayaknese NF male (p=0.451),
female (p=0.990); for Banjarese NF male (p=0.279), female (p=0.280); for Javanese NF male
(p=0.786), female (p=0.758). Since all p-values were higher than 0.050, it was said that the data
were in normal distribution. Then, the output of Levene's Test was (p= 0.811 > 0.05). It meant the
data were homogenous.
Testing Statistical Hypothesis
To answer the research questions, the learners’ composition of both groups were scored by two
raters. It was found to be 0.871, showing that both raters gave balanced scores about learners’
composition (see Table 2 in Appendices).
From the table above, it was found the average writing scores of each group based on gender,
learners’ cultural background and feedback types as follows. The mean score of male Dayaknese
learners using FDF was 72.67; female 75.50; male Banjarese learners were 69.20; female 76.29;
male Javanese learners was 72.00; female 76.70. Then, the mean score of male Dayaknese learners
using UDF was 66.00; female 75.17; male Banjarese learners was 69.17; female 73.38; male
Javanese learners was 68.86; female 73.22. On the contrary, the mean score of male Dayaknese
learners without using feedback/ NF was 55.17; female 55.71; male Banjarese learners was 55.43;
female 53.56; male Javanese learners was 52.67; female 57.38. The average score of both male
and female Dayaknese using FDF was 74.29; Banjarese, 73.33; and Javanese 74.61. The average
score of both male and female Dayaknese using UDF was 71.00; Banjarese, 71.57; and Javanese
71.31. The average score of both males and females without using feedback (NF) of Dayaknese
was 55.46, Banjarese 55.36, and Javanese 55.02
There are no differences in the population mean of writing scores due to the types of feedback
factor.
To response the RQ1: “Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ significantly caused by types of
corrective feedback factor?”, the three-way ANOVA table explained the answer. From the output
in Table 3, it was seen that the F value of types WCF was 131.546 and the value of sig. was 0.000.
As it was smaller than 0.05, it was said that null hypothesis expressing that the population mean
of writing score did not give effect due to the types of feedback factor was not accepted, and the
alternative hypothesis expressing that the population mean of writing score gave effect due to the
types of feedback factor could not be rejected. Therefore, it was said that the types of feedback
gave a facilitative effect on the learners’ writing accuracy. The mean score of learners’ writing
accuracy using FDF was 73.73 and using UDF was 70.97 (see Table 4 for further detail).
Meanwhile, the mean score of writing accuracy without using feedback (NF) was 54.98. It was
said that the learners’ writing accuracy using types of feedback outperformed better than those
who did not use feedback in control groups. However, focused direct feedback class performed
similar ability as those who received unfocused direct feedback.

There are no differences in the population mean of writing score due to the gender factor.
To response the RQ2: “Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ significantly caused by gender
factor?” it was seen on the three-way ANOVA table. From the output in Table 3, it was found that
the F value of gender was 14.955 and the value of significance was 0.000. As it was smaller than
0.05, it was said that the hypothesis of null expressing that there were no differences in the
population mean of writing score due to the gender factor was not accepted, and the alternative
hypothesis could not be rejected. Therefore, it was said that different gender gave strongly
influence on writing accuracy. The mean score of learners’ writing accuracy for male was 64.57
and female was 68.54 (see Table 5 for further detail). It was said that, in terms of gender, the
learners’ writing accuracy differed significantly different between males and females. In this case,
females performed better than males on the writing accuracy.

To response the RQ3: “Does the learners’ writing accuracy differ significantly caused by cultural
background factor?” it was seen on the three-way ANOVA table. From the output in Table 3, it
was found that the F value of the cultural background was 0.150 and the value of significance was
0.861. As it was higher than 0.05, it was said that hypothesis null expressing that there were no
differences in the population mean of writing score due to the cultural background factor was
accepted, and the alternative hypothesis was rejected. Therefore, it was said that learners’ cultural
background did not give influence significantly on writing accuracy. The mean score of learners’
writing accuracy for Dayaknese was 66.70; Banjarese 66.17; and Javanese 66.80 (see Table 6 for
further detail). It was said that, in terms of cultural background, the learners’ writing accuracy did
not differ significantly among Dayaknese, Banjarese, and Javanese.

Effect of Focused and Unfocused Feedback

Elhawwa, Rukmini, Mujiyanto & Sutopo

To sum up, to see the effect of three independent variables toward a dependent variable
was in the following output.
The output above explained that all independent variables (gender, types of feedback, and
interaction gender and types of feedback or types of feedback and gender) gave effect to the
dependent variable. Since the corrected model was 0.000 < 0.050, it meant that the model was
valid. The significance value (Sig.) of intercept was 0.000 or less than 0.05. It meant that the
intercept was significant. The significance value (Sig.) of gender was 0.000 or smaller than 0.05.
It meant that gender gave a facilitative effect significantly to the learners’ writing accuracy. The
significance value (Sig.) of types WCF was 0.000 or smaller than 0.05. It meant that types of
feedback provided a significant effect on writing accuracy. It meant that gender gave a facilitative
effect on the learners' writing accuracy. The significance value (Sig.) of the cultural background
was 0.861 or higher than 0.05. It meant that cultural background did not give effect significantly
to the learners’ writing accuracy. The significance value (Sig.) of gender and types of feedback
was 0.332 or higher than 0.05. Since the sig. of gender and types of feedback was 0.332 or higher
than 0.05, it meant that gender and types of feedback did not give effect significantly to the
learners’ writing score. The next step to interpreting the result of three-way ANOVA was to find
a Post Hoc test. The following table described multiple comparisons.
Based on the table above, the difference in mean between FDF and UDF was 2.8420 (Sig.
0.061). It meant that there was no significant difference between using FDF and UDF on the
learners’ writing accuracy. The difference of mean between FDF and No Feedback was 19.1358*
(Sig. 0.000); the difference of mean between UDF and No Feedback was16.2938* (Sig. 0.000). It
meant that there was a significant difference between using both focused and unfocused direct
feedback and No Feedback on learners’ writing accuracy. To see the further explanation on the
interaction effect between variables was described in the plot diagram as in Figure 1.

Based on the figures above, it was said that there was no interaction effect between variables. It
meant that gender, cultural background and types of feedback did not give significant effect on the
learners’ performance of writing.
To conclude, (1) the types of feedback gave a facilitative effect on the learners’ writing
accuracy. The mean score of learners’ writing accuracy using FDF was 73.73 and using UDF was
70.97. Meanwhile, the mean score of writing accuracy without using feedback (NF) was 54.98. It

was said that the learners’ writing accuracy using types of feedback outperformed better than those
who did not use feedback in control groups. However, focused direct feedback (mean 73.73) class
performed similar ability as those who received unfocused direct feedback (mean 70.97). (2) In
terms of gender, the learners' writing accuracy differed significantly different between males
(mean 64.37) and females (mean 68.54). The F value of gender was 14.955 and the value of
significance was 0.000. In this case, females performed better than males on the writing accuracy.
(3) In terms of cultural background, the learners’ writing accuracy did not differ significantly
among Dayaknese (mean 66.70), Banjarese (mean 66.17), and Javanese (mean 66.80). The F value
of the cultural background was 0.150 and the value of significance was 0.861 (>0.05). It was said
that learners’ cultural background did not give influence significantly on writing accuracy. (4)
There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by gender and the
types of corrective feedback factors. The F value of gender and types of feedback was 2.011 and
the value of significance was 0.139 (>0.05). It meant gender and the focused and unfocused
feedback factors did not give interaction effect in the population mean of writing score. (5). There
were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by cultural background
and types of corrective feedback factors. The F value of cultural background and types of feedback
was 0.148 and the value of significance was 0.964 (> 0.05). It meant that learners' cultural
backgrounds and types of feedback factors did not give interaction effect in the population mean
of writing scores. (6). There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy
caused by gender and cultural background factors. The F value of gender and types of feedback
was 0.183 and the value of significance was 0.833 (>0.05). It meant that gender and learners’
cultural background factors did not give interaction effect in the population mean of writing scores.
(7). There were no differences significantly on the learners’ writing accuracy caused by gender,
cultural background the types of corrective feedback factors. The F value of gender and types of
WCF was 1.095 and the Sig. The value was 0.363(>0.05). It meant that gender and learners’
cultural background and types of corrective feedback factors did not give interaction effect in the
population mean of writing scores.
Discussion
The study was to measure the effect of focused and unfocused feedback on L2 learners’ writing
accuracy with involving gender and learners’ cultural background factors. Based on the research
output, it could be stated that there was a significant difference for the types of feedback
(F=131.546, p=0.000), and gender (F=14.955; p=0.000) on the learners’ writing accuracy.
However, the learners’ cultural background (F= 0.150; p=0.861) did not give effect. On the
contrary, the interaction between: gender and cultural background (F=0.183, p=0.833); gender
and types of feedback (F=2.011, p=0.139); learners’ cultural background and types of feedback
(F=0.148, p=0.964); and among gender, cultural background and types of feedback (F=1.095,
p=0.363) did not give significant effect on the learners’ writing accuracy. The difference between
the effectiveness of FDF and UDF remained not significant. Both types of feedback had a positive
impact on learners' writing accuracy. In addition, the two ways of giving feedback (FDF and UDF)
seem to have a similar effect. The means core of FDF was 73.73 and UDF was 70.97.
This study was in accordance with Karimi and Fotovatnia (2010). The study showed that
focused feedback and unfocused feedback gave effect to learners’ grammatical accuracy in L2
writing. It was also in line with Sheen et al, (2009). They found that both treatment groups

increased their accuracy without significant differences between them. This finding was also
supported with Ellis, Sheen Murakami, and Takashima (2008), Kassim and Luan Ng (2014). This
finding was also validated with some researchers (e.g. Bitchener, Young, & Cameron, 2005;
Sheen, 2007; and Evans, Hartshorn, and Strong-Krause, 2011). Dealing with gender factors, the
result of this study was in line with Sadeghi, Khonbi, and Gheitranzadeh (2013). Sadeghi et al.
found gender gave significant on the learners' writing ability with females performing better than
males. To conclude, it was noted that gender and different types of feedback had a vital thing in
increasing learners' writing accuracy. In addition, corrective feedback was important for both the
teachers and learners in an L2 writing class. Corrective feedback must be provided seriously and
frequently to help L2 learners.
Conclusion and Recommendation
The findings proposed some thoughts concerning written feedback in an L2 writing class that
might be helpful for both teacher and students in the L2 writing class. In this case, L2 learners
should be made aware of the necessity of obtaining feedback. In this case, teachers should give
further explanation on the procedure and set the goals together with the learners in the classroom.
Teachers should plan well and do carefully to implement teacher feedback since the students would
get the advantages of teacher feedback. Furthermore, the teachers' feedback should be clear that
when learners understand the teachers' wants. Finally, teachers should monitor the learners during
the process of giving feedback to observe their language development in writing class. As this
research was conducted with only 128 learners, it was not very likely to generalize the findings.
Therefore, further researches might work with a greater number of participants so that they could
reach conclusions that are more generalizable.
