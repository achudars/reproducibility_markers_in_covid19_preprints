Abstract
Legitimation, the ways governments seek to justify their rule, is becoming an essential component of
our understanding of authoritarian regimes. This paper seeks to measure the changes in legitimation
efforts around the time of elections in authoritarian regimes. It is well understood that authoritarian
regimes can benefit from the process and image of elections, as long as they remain managed. But it
is less clear how these governments justify the management of such elections, and whether they are
accepted by the population. Relying on detailed events data measuring the frequency of certain
legitimating government statements, this paper tests whether electoral authoritarian regimes increase
their justifications for remaining in power or devote their efforts to undermining the legitimacy of
opposition parties in order to reduce the uncertainty of electoral loss.

Despite the benefits in survivability and legitimacy that elections provide to authoritarian regimes,
these events are still fraught with risk. Even when managed with manipulation or repression, election
results may still turn against a government, and altering the results after the fact may harm the image
of democracy that these regimes rely on ( Gandhi and Przeworski 2007; Way 2010; Bhasin and Gandhi
2013; Schedler 2013). While other forms of authoritarian electoral manipulation have been well
studied, less is known about how these governments talk about themselves during these contentious
and risky periods.
This paper relies on recent theorizing about regime legitimation—the ways governments try
to claim and appropriate political legitimacy—to test whether these claims change during election
periods in autocratic regimes. I argue that because of the increased political risks associated with
elections, governments will increase their efforts to construct their own political legitimacy and
convince the population that the incumbent regime matches their conceptions of a legitimate
government.

Regime Legitimation
Legitimation is defined as the attempts to shape public discourse in a way that achieves support from
the public—or at least tacit acceptance. It does not make any claims about the actual perceived political
legitimacy of the regime. Instead, it focuses on the efforts made by government actors to persuade the
population that the governments structure and behavior is legitimate.
Within authoritarian politics, legitimation can be seen as one of three strategies governments
can use to maintain power (Gerschewski 2013). Alongside violent state repression and the co-optation
of elites and opposition groups, legitimation seeks to generate the perception of that government’s
“right to rule” or, failing that, the acceptance of its authority (von Soest and Grauvogel 2017; Dukalskis
and Gerschewski 2017).
2

When trying to gain this right to rule, authoritarian governments attempt to supply their own
conceptions of political legitimacy and match those concepts already held by the population. Because
the citizenry always has the option to ignore or dismiss the government’s claims to its own legitimacy,
some effort must be spent justifying regime structures and behaviors in the context of what is already
held to be legitimate political activity. For example, an authoritarian regime may issue statements
arguing that some opposition group is a national security threat in order to legitimate its manipulation
of elections. However, if the holding of peaceful elections is considered by the population to be
legitimate political behavior, then the government will be less able to use violence on election day
against the opposition group lest it risk its image of political legitimacy.
While theoretical explanations for the incentives and payoffs of legitimation have gained
recent attention, see von Soest and Grauvogel (2017) for the most recent framework, the empirical
underpinnings of legitimation remain largely unexamined. In this context, I argue that the amount of
legitimation matters. Just like governments change how frequently they repress or which elites to coopt, they can choose the level to which they engage in legitimation. Autocratic regimes can talk more
or talk less, and will do so depending on the situation in the rest of the political system.

Legitimation during Elections
Because elections represent times of uncertainty, legitimation is generally expected to increase during
these times. As Schedler (2013) points out, while authoritarian regimes work to manage the risk
associated with losing an election, there is always a chance that these measures are not sufficient.
Increased mobilization, failure of institutions or actors responsible for repression and election
manipulation, or information problems can all lead to failures in authoritarian election manipulation.
In this environment, legitimation claims become a mechanism to help further reduce the risk
of electoral failure. They broadcast the reasons why the government is justified in its behavior, and
3

why that behavior is best for the country and people. Rather than try to physically alter election results
or suppress opposition activity, they seek to drown out legitimation by opposition parties and
candidates and persuade the population that the government is the best of all other possible outcomes.
During an authoritarian election, legitimation is expected to increase through several
mechanisms. First, the perception of electoral uncertainty caused by the election will drive the
government to attempt to reinforce its sense of legitimacy in the public’s eyes, and mobilize supporters
akin to a political campaign in consolidated democracies. Increased legitimacy claims will be generated
in order to call attention to regime successes—such as increased economic growth or security. For the
regime, the goal is to increase the presence of these successes in the minds of the voting population,
thereby increasing their enthusiasm for the regime despite any authoritarian tendencies, and ensuring
political survival.
Second, increased legitimation claims can seek to justify negatively perceived behaviors.
During elections, it can be expected that opposition parties will be negatively framing regime behaviors
and policy outcomes to maximize their chances of winning. These are designed to mobilize
sympathizers against the regime, and there is no reason to expect a government to oppose this
mobilization while simultaneously mobilizing its own supporters. In this regard, increasing positive
statements about the government may directly counteract negative framing by the opposition.
Additionally, publics can be expected to know that the regime is manipulating election
structures in order to increase its chances of winning. As a result, the government can not claim to
win a free and fair election and derive its legitimacy from that. In this case, legitimation during the
election should become even more important. Instead, meddling in an election needs to be framed as
an acceptable measure to ensure positive outcomes for the country as a whole. Since groups talking
about any regime failures are likely to highlight a failure to hold free and fair elections, the government
must justify doing so by referencing the positive side effects of such behavior.
4

Lastly, increases in legitimation may simply be attempts by governments to drown out that of
the opposition. It is already understood that government actors, regardless of regime type, have easier
access to media (Balmas 2014; Balmas and Sheafer 2014; Rice and Somerville 2016). Governments
may use this access during elections to saturate media, and therefore the population, with their
messages. This limits population access to alternative voices, and removes them from the field of
messages that voters will be using for information before elections.
These messages are expected to be carried to the population through the public statements
made by governments and associated actors about the positive behavior and results of the regime as
a whole. It should be noted that none of this is an argument that legitimation itself will actually change
voter opinions or reduce the effectiveness of opposition claims. This study is an early effort to explain
how the government’s attempts to generate legitimacy with the public change with the need to manage
the uncertainty associated with hybrid or electoral authoritarianism. The following section lays out an
initial cross-national quantitative examination of the factors expected to change the amount of
legitimation claims made by an authoritarian government.

Research Design
Because I am interested in how authoritarian governments try to claim legitimacy rather than achieve
it, data on actions themselves are required. For this, I rely on the Integrated Crisis Early Warning
System machine coded event data (ICEWS) and regime classification data from the Authoritarian
Regimes Data set (ARD) (Boschee et al. 2017; Wahman, Teorell, and Hadenius 2013)
ICEWS is ideal for this purpose because it records “who did what to whom,” which allows
for the selection of statements made by governments that carry legitimation claims to the population.
Although governments make many kinds of statements, the observation of source actor, target actor,

5

and specific type of statement allows for a cross-national measurement of the volume of legitimation
claims made by governments.
These data are used to generate the dependent variable Legitimation, which is a monthly count
of all statements issued by government actors regarding the rallying of support for the government,
appeals to end dissident behavior, symbolic acts, and praise for domestic civilian actors. Events only
count as legitimation if they are targeted at domestically located, non-governmental actors. Because
this variable is a count of the number of such statements made by a government, it closely measures
the volume of legitimation claims that I am concerned with testing.
For each country year identified in the ARD, I distinguish between several types of electoral
structure. These data assign the labels of no party, single party, and multiparty to autocracies that carry
out some form of electoral competition but vary by the number of parties that are allowed to compete
for office. For each country year, a government receives a dichotomous indicator for either Multiparty,
Single Party, or No Party. For completion, and to compare between electoral autocracies and
democracies, all countries observed as democracies are also given an indicator variable. All regimes
that do not carry out elections, such as monarchies or military regimes, are excluded from the analysis.
The ARD pose a challenge in that they do not record if the country-year is one where elections
were held. At this stage, ICEWS is used to generate an indicator of elections. Two election related
variables are generated from these data. First, Promise Election contains a country-month count of all
the domestically targeted public statements where a government official agrees to hold an election.
These are measured because this can be seen as the start of the period of electoral uncertainty that
electoral authoritarians must face. Additionally, promises to hold elections may be the result of or be
interpreted as concessions to the opposition. In order to prevent these concessions from undermining
regime survival, they can be “spun” as meeting the demand legitimacy of the population.

6

Second, Hold Election contains the monthly count of all times an election was reported in the
ICEWS source material. Regardless of level of government, this gives a count of all the elections taking
place that month. At these times, then, it is expected that legitimation is at its highest since electoral
uncertainty is also at its highest.
This measurement strategy for promised and held elections permits the capture of elections at
national and regional levels, so legitimation changes will be related to more than the widely-viewed
national elections. They also help to provide a more specific However, because ICEWS does not
record what type of elections are being held, we cannot distinguish between election level or number
of candidates.
Several necessary control variables are also generated using the ICEWS data. These are
informed by the other behaviors or statements that may drive governments to change how heavily
they seek to justify their behavior. De-legitimation controls for the number of negative statements made
about political opposition in the country. During an election, governments are going to engage in
trying to undermine the legitimacy and claims of their opposition, and could choose to do so without
engaging in any extra legitimation themselves. Controlling for this ensures that the full range of
electoral statements that can be made by a government will be accounted for.
Governments may go further than verbally opposing the framing carried out by political
opposition. If the threat to political survival is higher than anticipated, governments may Threaten State
Repression. This variable accounts for all the verbal threats to use violence against mobilized dissidents.
Because threats of violence may undermine the perception of legitimacy of the government or
election, and targets must be justified, a corresponding increase in legitimation activity is expected.
Administrative Sanctions accounts for all the limits on political behavior that a government can
carry out short of using armed force. This includes imposing curfews on public assembly and
administratively restricting the rights of opposition groups to participate in politics. Not only can this
7

be carried out in the course of an election to restrict the chances of the opposition of winning, it is
likely to be accompanied by some form of legitimation—justifying why the restrictions are necessary
or why a particular group is no longer permitted to engage in political activity.
Criminal Convictions covers the use of legal proceedings and criminal courts to punish the
population. While these may not necessarily be political, governments often justify why some criminal
punishment is acceptable. If the criminal case is important enough to be reported in media, then it is
already likely to be followed by the public. When governments go to justify their behavior in the realm
of criminal justice then, their statements would be picked up as legitimation. As a result, changes in
legitimation caused by non-electoral activity need to be controlled lest they interfere with the influence
of regime type and elections.
Use State Repression controls for the use of violence against mobilized protest activity. Because
of the risks associated with state repression (see Davenport and Inman 2012) in terms of failure or
backlash, we can expect legitimation to change a great deal when it is used. Since elections are times
for uncertainty and active electoral opposition can generate the threat perception that drives
repression, we can expect repression to increase during elections. Because of these risks, governments
will increase their legitimation to try and justify the use of repression.
The same risks of state repression are also present for other non-protest uses of violence.
Physical Integrity Violations accounts for ICEWS events that match physical integrity violations such as
abductions and mass killings. Since these require justification, or may be perceived negatively by the
population, it is likely that legitimation will increase as the number of these events also increase.
Protests and Riots account for peaceful demonstrations and violent events caused by civilian
populations that can be expected to increase legitimation behavior. Because these are other events
that may undermine the perceived legitimacy of the regime, it is reasonable to expect that governments
will increase their legitimation claims in response. When politics become contentious and more
8

attention is being paid to regime failures, the government might have higher incentive to champion
its successes—“reminding” the population of all the things that they should support the state for.
Because of the count nature of the dependent variable, the models presented in the following
section are estimated with a time-series cross-sectional negative binomial regression. This covers all
countries from 1995-2014, defined on its lower bound by the availability of ICEWS starting in 1995
and on its upper bound by the ARD data. Temporal dependence is controlled with a single month lag
of the dependent variable.

Findings
Alone, elections themselves only appear to be weakly related to increases in legitimation activity. Table
1 compares all electoral autocracy types to democracies. Multiparty and no-party autocracies legitimate
less frequently than consolidated democracies, while single party regimes are weakly associated with
higher levels of overall legitimation. Throughout the entire sample, the promise to hold an election
actually decreases legitimation activity while the holding of an actual election increases legitimation
across the board. Table 2 compares electoral regimes to multi-party autocracies. Again, single party
regimes appear unique in that they legitimate themselves more frequently than their multiparty
counterparts.
Table 3 contains interactions between the electoral autocracy indicators and election promises
or execution, providing the most direct tests of the expectation laid out above. While most electorally
oriented autocracies seem to be less active in their legitimation than consolidated democracies in
general, this changes when those regimes are faced with a promised or held election. In both cases,
multiparty and single party autocracies increase the amount of legitimating statements broadcast when
elections are promised and held. Because there were no instances where a no party autocracy held or

9

promised an election, these interactions were omitted and no conclusions about their election
legitimation behavior can be made.

Discussion and Conclusions
Although electorally oriented autocracies engage in less overall legitimation than their democratic
counterparts, multiparty and single party autocracies increase how much legitimation they use when
promising elections and when carrying them out. During these periods, the uncertainty associated
with elections incentivizes these regimes to make extra efforts to convince the population that its
behavior is politically legitimate. At these points, it is the only time that an electoral autocracy will
legitimate its behavior more frequently than democratic governments. In addition, this “pillar” of
authoritarianism exists alongside and changes with changes in violence and co-optation and the
evidence presented here indicates that legitimation changes for strategic purposes as well.
At this stage, these models are initial evidence about the influences on the amount of
legitimation used within the theoretical framework laid out by earlier research. Some avenues of
further work will be helpful in clarifying this relationship. First, these models leave unexamined how
legitimation changes over the course of a single election. We have evidence that election moments
change legitimation’s use, but cannot interpret when it is at its most intense. It remains unclear
whether legitimation is increased for the entire election cycle, or if it becomes its greatest closer to
the day of the election itself. While this would require a highly fine-grained analysis, ICEWS does
provide daily data, so it should be possible to build a case study during election and non-election
years to allow the tracing of legitimation intensity as an election is promised and the campaigns
proceed.
These data also require supplementation that incorporates the structure of the elections
themselves. The combination of repression, manipulation, and legitimation that surrounds an
election will interact with the overall legal structure that governs how parties take office. So, while
legitimation increases across all electoral regimes, the regime specific reasons remain unclear. For
13

example, a multiparty autocracy may engage in increased legitimation that targets specific issues used
in opposition party campaigns. The opposition criticizes regime behavior on some issue or policy,
and regime legitimation responds with how that interpretation is untrue or incorrect. On the other
hand, a single-party regime may focus on overall national level performance in order to help its
candidate of choice win. Because all candidates are members of the same political party, legitimation
will need to balance passing on the government’s preferred message without undermining faith in
the party as a whole and prevent calls for increased competition.
While these two avenues, and better data for this test, are left for future work, there is
evidence here for legitimation taking place and changing when political conditions change. In
addition, it provides such evidence at a cross-national level using a measurement process that can be
easily applied across cases; contributing to the generalizability of legitimation theories and methods
of examining its use.
