Millions of Canadians rely on public transportation to conduct daily activities and
participate in the labour force. However, many low-income households are disadvantaged because existing public transit service does not provide them with sufficient
access to destinations. Limited transit options, compounded with socioeconomic disadvantage, can result in transport poverty, preventing travel to important destinations, like employment opportunities. Given the growing gentrification of Canadian
downtowns and the dispersion of poverty into Canadian suburbs, the time is right for
a national accounting of those living in transport poverty, and the development of a
national transport and land use strategy for alleviating the risks of accessibility deprivation. Accordingly, in this paper we measure and analyze vertical inequalities in
access to employment in Canadian cities in order to estimate how many, where, and to
what extent, Canadians are at risk of transport poverty. We make use of open transit
network data and cutting edge accessibility measurement methods to generate comparative scores suitable for a national-scale analysis. We find that in aggregate, lower
income neighbourhoods tend to have better levels of transit accessibility. But despite
this overall positive outlook, there are still nearly one million low-income individuals
living in urban areas with low transit accessibility. We summarize our findings by
generating descriptive typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty which are
then used to develop and recommend planning strategies to reduce inequalities.

Public transit is paramount in providing many urban residents around the world with
the ability to travel to daily activities and participate in the labour force. Especially
within lower income groups, transit is often the only means for accomplishing independent travel. Despite this reliance, many neighbourhoods are disadvantaged because
public transit does not provide all places with sufficient access to destinations, like
employment opportunities. Poor transit accessibility, combined with other forms of
social and economic disadvantage (e.g. poor health, not being able to afford a car,
etc.), can result in transport poverty (Casas, 2007; Preston & Rajé, 2007; Lucas,
2012). This can limit people in their ability to find employment opportunities and
participate in the labour force. In Canada, governments are currently investing billions of dollars in public transport with very little guidance on whether and how this
infrastructure can be used to achieve a higher degree of transport justice in Canadian
cities. Social equity and inclusion are part of provincial and municipal policy goals
across the country (Government of Canada, 2017), but to date there has been no
attempt to understand the scale of transport poverty at a national scale. To address
this knowledge shortcoming, the objectives of this paper are threefold:

1. Measure transit access to employment for Canada’s eight largest cities to analyze inequalities in accessibility with respect to socioeconomic status (SES).

2. Estimate where and to what extent Canadians are at risk of transport poverty.

3. Generate neighbourhood-level typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty
in order to recommend urban planning strategies aimed at reducing risks of
transport-related exclusion.

Our findings show that low SES residents are generally more centrally located
and have relatively higher levels of transit accessibility. Despite this positive outlook
in aggregate, there are still a substantial number of low SES Canadians who are living
in areas with low transit accessibility. We estimate the number of Canadians at risk
of transport poverty by counting low income or otherwise vulnerable residents who
are living in the lowest areas of transit accessibility. We find that within Canada’s
eight largest cities, 5% of the total population are living in low income households
which are also situated in areas with low transit accessibility. This totals to nearly
one million people who are at risk of transport poverty nation-wide.

Through a cluster analysis approach, we generate descriptive typologies of transport poor neighbourhoods. We find that transport poverty is most apparent in very
dense, low-income, tower-neighbourhoods located off of the main axes of transit supply, or wherever low income populations live in low-density suburban urban forms
across the nation. We use these findings to recommend policy and urban planning
strategies directed towards improving transit accessibility and reducing risks of trans-

port poverty in Canadian cities. Policy recommendations include focusing future transit investments in areas which have high concentrations of low income households and
low levels of transit accessibility, intensification and diversity of land-use to increase
accessibility and reduce commute distances, as well as a consideration of subsidizing
ride-sharing or implementing demand-responsive transit in low density areas.

This is the first time, from our knowledge, that an accounting of transport
poverty has been conducted at a national scale anywhere in the world. And since concerns of transport poverty are escalating internationally, the methodologies described
in this paper can inform studies in other countries as well. The policy recommendations in this paper can also provide guidance for urban areas outside of Canada since
Canadian cities are quite similar in terms of urban form and transportation issues to
some cities in the United States, Australia, and Europe.

A primary function of an urban transport system is to provide people the opportunity
to participate in daily activities, social interactions, and access to destinations necessary for their well-being. The concept of accessibility is commonly used to assess the
distribution of benefits of urban transport systems. Accessibility can be understood
as the ease of reaching destinations (Hansen, 1959) and is increasingly being used to
evaluate transport plans and land use policy (Papa et al., 2014; Merlin et al., 2018).
In modern cities, greater levels of accessibility have been significantly associated with
shorter commuting times (Kawabata & Shen, 2007; Hu, 2015), increased employment
rates (Sanchez, 1999; Merlin & Hu, 2017), greater levels of activity participation
(Paez et al., 2009; Cordera et al., 2017), and it can foster social inclusion and reduce
social isolation (Garrett & Taylor, 1999; Lucas, 2012).

The distribution of land-use and transportation networks in cities is never spatially uniform. Therefore, access to destinations is never equal among urban populations. While some inequality is inevitable, particularly low levels of accessibility can
potentially result in transport poverty. Transport poverty occurs when transport disadvantage (not having access to a car, poor public transit options, etc.) compounds
with other forms of potential social disadvantage (unemployment or low income, disability or poor health, etc.) (Lucas, 2012). Transport poverty is the compounded
lack of ability to travel to important destinations and activities. This can result in
an increased generalized cost of reaching destinations, suppression of activity participation, and, in the worst cases, can result in the perpetuation of social exclusion
(Casas, 2007; Preston & Rajé, 2007; Pereira et al., 2017).

From a justice perspective, the normative argument for reducing inequalities is
often framed through a moral lens of social equity. At a basic level, social equity
refers to the fairness with which impacts (i.e. benefits and costs) are distributed.
For transport policy, social equity is usually framed towards providing equality of
opportunity (e.g. to access destinations) rather than of outcome (Litman, 2003).
Recent approaches for investigating social equity in transport have included drawing
upon Walzer’s Spheres of Justice (Walzer, 1983) and Rawls’ A Theory of Justice
(Rawls, 1971) to advocate for increasing the average accessibility in a region while at
the same time reducing the gap between the highest and lowest levels of accessibility
(Martens, Golub, & Robinson, 2012; Martens, 2016; Pereira et al., 2017).

Assessing the equity of transport systems is often approached by framing equity in terms of horizontal or vertical dimensions (Litman, 2002; Delbosc & Currie,
2011; Pereira et al., 2017). Horizontal equity is concerned with the distribution of
a resource, like transit provision, equally amongst the overall population. Vertical
equity pertains to the distribution of a resource with focus towards specific groups,
often those who are more vulnerable to social or economic exclusion. As it pertains to
transportation, vertical equity is often studied in relation to income and social class
(Litman, 2002; Welch & Mishra, 2013). In other words, vertical equity is focused on
analyzing the compounding factors that can result in transport poverty. There have
been a plethora of studies which have measured inequalities in accessibility among
the overall population and comparing with various subgroups, who are potentially
more vulnerable to experiencing transport poverty. Some studies have found differing levels of accessibility for minority groups (Parks, 2004; Klein et al., 2018), recent
immigrants (Blumenberg, 2008; Farber et al., 2018), single-parent families (Páez et
al., 2013), by age cohorts (Delbosc & Currie, 2011; Barnes et al., 2016), by gender
(Hanson & Pratt, 1995; Klein et al., 2018), or by wages and income levels (Delbosc &
Currie, 2011; Fan et al., 2012). Other studies have generated combined measures of
socio-economic disadvantage at a neighbourhood level to compare with accessibility
measures to highlight where gaps in transit accessibility align with social need (Foth
et al., 2013; Fransen et al., 2015). Research has also shown that the travel modes
available to an individual makes a substantial difference in terms of access to destinations, particularly the disparity between transit riders and those who have regular
use of a private vehicle (Benenson et al., 2011; Golub & Martens, 2014; Benenson et
al., 2017). There have been a number of academic reviews which have discussed how
social equity, and in particular improving people’s access to destinations, should be
further incorporated into transportation plans and policy to reduce inequalities and
foster social and economic inclusion (Wee & Geurs, 2011; Karner & Niemeier, 2013;
Manaugh et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2017).

Access to employment opportunities in particular has been a key indicator for
evaluating the performance and social outcomes of a city’s transport network (Shen,
1998; El-Geneidy & Levinson, 2006; Bania et al., 2008). Employment is paramount

to preventing social exclusion as it provides the financial ability to support other aspects of life. The ability to obtain and retain employment can depend on a number
of factors like education, social network, and size and proximity to the labour market. Difficulties in finding employment can be compounded if local transit service is
ineffective in providing access to destinations in a reasonable amount of time (Kain,
1992). Some recent studies have examined how lower levels of transit accessibility
can negatively affect employment outcomes (Sanchez, 1999; Allard & Danziger, 2002;
Merlin & Hu, 2017). In a survey in the UK, two out of five unemployed citizens
link difficulties in finding employment with the inability to use a car and insufficient
public transit options (Social Exclusion Unit, 2003). Other studies have not found
a significant relationship with job access and employment outcomes. For example,
Sanchez, Shen, and Peng (2004) found no association between transit access and
employment status of welfare recipients in six American cities. Access to employment by transit is also associated with transit mode share (Owen & Levinson, 2015;
Boisjoly & El-Geneidy, 2016), indicating that if transit accessibility is improved for
an area, then it could encourage a mode shift away from private vehicles and have
other environmental and economic benefits like reducing congestion and emissions.
Jobs accessibility is also a good proxy for access to other types of destinations as the
location of jobs are highly correlated with other key activity destinations like shops,
services, and recreation.

In recent decades, Canada has witnessed a rise in socioeconomic inequalities, and
concentrations of poverty, both at a regional level (Breau, 2015) and within cities
(Hulchanski et al., 2010; Walks & Twigge-Molecey, 2013; Breau et al., 2018). Along
with this growth in poverty, evidence has indicated that poverty distributions have
become more suburbanized; increased costs of housing in city centres have pushed
lower-income residents to more affordable, but less accessible areas (Ades et al., 2012,
2016).

Moreover, several Canadian research projects have found that people living in
areas with low accessibility have significantly lower activity participation rates, particularly for those who are socially disadvantaged in other ways. For example, McCray
and Brais (2007) examined how transportation factors limit the daily activity patterns of low income women in Quebec City. Spinney et al. (2009) showed there is
significant association between transport mobility benefits and quality of life for elderly Canadians. Allen and Farber (2018) analyzed how low accessibility limits the
on-campus participation of University students. A series of papers from the same research effort used large-scale travel surveys and spatial econometric models of travel
behaviour to identify how the disparities in accessibility among low income, elderly,
and single-parent families dissuaded participation in daily activities (Paez et al., 2009;

Roorda et al., 2010; Páez et al., 2013). Many suburban low-SES households currently
have a vehicle which they rely on for daily travel. However, they may still be at risk of
transport poverty as they are more sensitive to increasing costs of driving (fuel costs,
paying interest on car loans, etc.) which increase the likelihood of not being able
to afford a vehicle in the future, meaning they would become reliant on insufficient
transit service (Mattioli et al., 2018; Walks, 2018).

The Canadian government is currently investing billions of dollars on transit
in aims to relieve congestion, reduce travel times, and increase accessibility. The
2016 federal budget pledged $3.4 billion towards transit investment over the subsequent three years, and in 2017 the Canadian government announced it will invest
$20.1 billion over the next decade in public transit through bilateral agreements with
provinces (Government of Canada, 2017). Provincial and municipal governments
are also investing substantially in transit infrastructure projects. Even though social equity and inclusion are increasingly a part of policy goals in regions across the
country, as well as at a national level (Government of Canada, 2017), there is little
coordination or guidance as to whether or how these goals can be addressed through
investments in public transit infrastructure. We argue that by accounting for the
number of transport-poor people across the nation in this paper, we can shed light
on the importance for the development of national, provincial, and municipal policy
strategies that can be used to steer transport investments in a socially progressive
manner.

There has been some previous research in analyzing transit access to employment
in Canadian cities, primarily focused in Montreal and Toronto. These existing studies have involved analyzing inequalities in accessibility comparing with socioeconomic
status (Páez et al., 2013; Foth et al., 2013; El-Geneidy et al., 2016), incorporating
fare costs into accessibility measures (El Geneidy et al., 2016), comparing transit
accessibility before and after long-term changes in transportation infrastructure and
land use patterns (Foth et al., 2013; Farber & Grandez, 2017), or examining daily
fluctuations in accessibility (Boisjoly & El-Geneidy, 2016; El-Geneidy et al., 2016;
Wessel, Allen, & Farber, 2017). Overall, this existing work has indicated that lower
income neighbourhoods generally have better transit access to jobs than the overall
population. Correlation results are however most likely skewed by the large number of affluent suburban neighbourhoods with poor transit accessibility. Despite this
positive outlook in aggregate, there are still potentially large numbers of low income
suburban households lacking sufficient access to employment that are not being accounted for. A report on social inclusion in transport planning in Canada estimated
that a third or more of households in Canada have at least one member who is transport disadvantaged (Litman, 2003). And while ample research has linked transport
disadvantage with activity participation and well-being (Spinney et al., 2009; Paez
et al., 2009), there is little existing detailed knowledge on the scope of the national
transport poverty problem, and how it is distributed within and between Canadian

cities. This means that existing policy does not have a clear understanding of how
to funnel transit investment into projects that reduce inequalities in transit accessibility. The following sections detail analyzing inequalities in transit accessibility and
quantifying the extent of transport poverty in Canada’s eight largest cities.

This study looks at the eight most populous metropolitan regions in Canada. Additively, these have been referred to as urban megaregions (Simmons & Bourne, 2013).
For our study, we use household demographic and employment data from the 2016
Canadian census. From the 2016 Canadian census, 58% of Canadians live in the
eight study regions. The boundaries of these regions for our study are composed
from Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA). CMAs are agglomerations of municipalities
which pertain to urban areas with a population of over 100,000 where at least 50% of
the employed labour force works in the region’s core (Statistics Canada, 2016a). For
our study, any adjacent CMAs are merged due to the commuting flow and transit
agencies that link adjacent regions together. See Table 1 for summary statistics of
each urban region.

For our analysis, we use a measure of competitive access to employment. Competitive measures of access to employment allow for comparing between regions by
accounting for competition both among the labour force for jobs as well as competition among employers for employees (Geurs & van Eck, 2003; Merlin & Hu, 2017).
These measures were computed at the census Dissemination Area (DA) level using
2016 census demographic and employment data (Statistics Canada, 2016b). DAs are
the smallest geography in which demographic and socio-economic data are released
for the Canadian census. Competitive access to employment measures were calculated
as follows.

is a measure of access to the labour force from work location j (i.e. the number of
workers in the catchment area of a place of employment). Pi is the size of the labour
force at i. ti,j,d and ti,j,τ are travel times by driving and transit during the morning
commute period. Travel times were computed using OpenStreetMap and GTFS data.
As in other studies (Owen & Levinson, 2015; Farber & Fu, 2017), travel times by
transit were computed for every minute, τ , during the morning commute period M
(7:00am to 8:59am), and then averaged to account for fluctuating transit schedules.
The impedance functions for transit and driving, f (ti,j,τ ) and f (ti,j,d ), use an inversepower decay function parametrized such that a 30 minute commute returns a value
of 0.5, and with a maximum value of 1 (at ti,j = 0). 30 minutes is approximately the
average commute duration across all eight regions (Statistics Canada, 2016b). The
two f (t) terms in Ai permit accurate comparison between cities which have differing
transport networks and sub-optimal distributions of opportunities (Delamater, 2013).
αi,D is the commute mode share ratio of workers at location i who travel to work via
private vehicle. αi,T is the mode share ratio by transit and walking. The mode share
for transit for our study is assumed as the total non-driving commuting population
(αi,T = 1 - αi,D ), and therefore also includes the small percent of those who take
active modes (bike or walk). This assumes that those who bike or walk to work are
also able to commute to work by transit, but not by car. The resulting values of Ai,T
and Ai,D are scaled (via the parameter k) from 0 to 1 to provide easier interpretation,
where 0 is no access and 1 is the maximum level of access to employment observed
for any travel mode across Canada (URL blinded for review).

Accessibility was computed for access to all jobs in each region as well as access
to jobs by different income levels in order to examine if there is a greater mismatch
between low-income workers and low-income jobs. When computing access to jobs
stratified by income level, Oj and Pi pertain to jobs and the labour force within the
specified income range. The income ranges are split at $10,000 intervals of yearly
after-tax individual income (Statistics Canada, 2016a).

There are two potential limitations regarding the accessibility measures used in
this study. One is that the spatial distribution of actual jobs seekers and job openings
could vary from the overall population and employment surfaces (Fransen et al., 2018).
However, we only had available data for the overall labour force and the total amount
of employment in these regions. From our knowledge, comprehensive data for job
seekers and openings does not exist Canada-wide. Another limitation is that we do
not consider the monetary cost of travel. Some transit agencies have greater fares than
others which could deter travel, particularly for lower income groups and trips that
involve travelling with more than one transit agency. El Geneidy et al. (2016) showed
how this could impact accessibility measurements in Montreal. Toronto is similar in
that there are multiple transit agencies each with their own fare structure.

For the subsequent analysis, we only include people living in areas with a population density greater than 200 people/km2 . Areas under this threshold are omitted

from analysis as they typically pertain to rural or large industrial areas in our regions
of study, typically areas without transit supply. Leaving these areas in our analysis
would skew our results since some municipalities have more rural areas than others,
depending on how the municipalities and CMAs are delineated. 200 people/km2 is
the same urban-rural threshold used by Delbosc and Currie (2011) in measuring transit equity in Melbourne, Australia, a city with similar urban form characteristics to
Canadian cities.

Analyzing Inequalities in Access to Employment

In this section, we analyze the association between SES with transit access to employment using simple correlation measures. For indicators of SES, we use four incomerelated categories from the census; unemployment rate (UR), the log of median aftertax household income (ln MHI), and two variables of low income status tabulated by
Statistics Canada, the low income measure (LIM) and the low income cut-off (LICO).
The LIM is a count of households below the low-income line. This line is set at half
the median household income and adjusted by the square root of the number of persons living in the household. This has the effect of raising the low income line for
households with more people, but at a diminishing rate of increase (Statistics Canada,
2016a). Alternatively, the LICO pertains to households which are estimated to spend
more than 20% of their income on basic necessities (e.g. food, shelter, and clothing),
relative to an average family. The LICO controls for regional variations as well as
household size to account for differing costs of living. These four income categories

are highly correlated. To examine their compounded effect, we also generate a combined measure of neighbourhood SES, weighting the four variables equally. This is
generated as follows, where Iˆ pertains to the standardized score of each of the four
measures.
Iµ = 0.25Iˆln M HI − 0.25IˆU R − 0.25IˆLIM − 0.25IˆLICO

The lower the Iµ , the lower the SES of the DA.
We then generate Pearson correlation coefficients between these income variables
and transit access to jobs. We conduct this analysis in terms of access to all jobs as well
as access to jobs stratified by different by income levels. Table 2 shows correlation for
access to all jobs as well as access to low-income jobs. Access to all jobs and access
to low-income jobs produces similar correlation coefficients with measures of SES.
Similar results were also found for other income brackets, but this is not presented in
the table for the sake of brevity.

Median household income, as well as the two low-income prevalence categories
(LIM and LICO), are significantly correlated with transit accessibility in each of the
eight regions. This is the same overall relationship as in previous research in Toronto,
which found that neighbourhoods of lower socioeconomic status tend to have better
transit accessibility (Foth et al., 2013; El-Geneidy et al., 2016). Table 2 indicates that
this relationship is similar, and even accentuated, in cities across the nation. Comparing between cities, we observe that transit access in Toronto and Calgary have the
weakest association with income categories, while Montreal, Winnipeg, and Quebec

City have the strongest association. We also observe that unemployment is less associated with transit accessibility compared to the other income measures. Toronto,
Vancouver, and Calgary do not have a strong relationship between unemployment
and transit accessibility, while in the other cities, unemployed people are more likely
to be in areas with good transit accessibility.

Overall, these results show that transit accessibility is vertically equitable in all
of the cities included in our analysis. Transit is serving low-income residents, those
who theoretically have a greater need, with higher levels of accessibility compared to
high income residents. This could be due to a number of factors. One is that transit
is being directly or indirectly planned to serve lower income residents. Lower-income
households live in smaller units with higher levels of population density, and transit
is usually more efficient in more intensely developed neighbourhoods. Second, there
may be preference-selection effects. People living near transit may be satisfied with
lower incomes relative to housing costs as they will not need to pay for a private
vehicle, and wealthier households who have no intention to use transit choose to live
in larger lots at greater distances to employment. Lower-income households without
cars are more likely move to areas with higher levels of transit service (Glaeser et al.,
2008). Third, there are historical factors which have led to concentrations of lower SES
populations in older downtown housing stocks which have either experienced decay or
were redeveloped into low-income apartment complexes in the post-war period.

Despite the overall positive outlook seen in the above correlation analyses, there are
still a large number of low SES neighbourhoods with low transit accessibility, and
the situation of these people need to be accounted for. Also, the previous analysis
correlates at a neighbourhood level, but does not take into consideration the income
distributions within each areal unit. This potentially obfuscates low-income households at risk of transport poverty in neighbourhoods which have higher levels of SES
on average.

To estimate the extent of transport poverty in Canada, we tabulate the number
of low-income or otherwise vulnerable populations in areas of low transit accessibility. We first tabulate counts living in the lowest deciles of transit access to jobs for
each region. Tabulating by deciles provides a simple interpretation like ”there are
X number of people living in the lowest 10% of transit accessibility for each region”.
However, this does not provide an adequate comparison between regions (there will
always be a lowest 10%, even in a relatively high-access city). Accordingly, we also
tabulate populations under certain thresholds of transit accessibility. Specifically, we
count the populations in areas where transit accessibility is less than 0.1 and where it
is less than 0.05 (on the scale of competitive accessibility where 0 is the minimum and

1 is the maximum observed for anyone across these eight Canadian regions). This
allows for interpretation in the form of ”there are X number of people living in areas
of low and extremely low levels of nationally comparative transit accessibility”.

These categories of low transit accessibility are cross-tabulated with four socioeconomic variables which are likely to compound with low transit accessibility and
result in transport poverty. Firstly, we tabulate using two measures specified by
Statistics Canada (2016), the low income cut-off (LICO) and the low income measure
(LIM). These groups are more likely to face financial constraints, like not being able
to afford a private vehicle, and are more likely to rely on transit. If transit accessibility is relatively low, it could increase the risk of transport poverty (Lucas, 2012). As
well, we sum cross-tabulations by two other measures of socio-economic status which
could compound with transport disadvantage and result in transport poverty. One is
recent immigrant status (immigrated between 2011 and 2016) as recent immigrants
are more likely to rely on transit due to the time-intensive process of obtaining a
driving license, the cost of a vehicle, and potential language barriers (Lo, Shalaby, &
Alshalalfah, 2011; Farber et al., 2018). Recent immigrants are also more likely to be
in search of employment. Lastly we tabulate by the number of individuals who are
unemployed, since previous research has linked difficulties of unemployed individuals
in finding work with the inability to use a car and insufficient public transit options
(Social Exclusion Unit, 2003; Merlin & Hu, 2017). These cross-tabulations are shown
in Tables 3 and 4.

The results indicate that even though low SES residents are more likely to be
in areas of higher transit accessibility, there are still a large number living in areas
of low transit accessibility. These people may a be small percentage of the overall
population, or even just a modest share of low-income people overall, but given the
sizes of the populations under investigation, the overall number of people at risk
of transport poverty is quite substantial. Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto have
particularly large counts of low-income, unemployed, and recent immigrants in areas
of low transit accessibility relative to their totals, while in Quebec City, Winnipeg, and
Ottawa, relatively fewer vulnerable populations are living in areas with low transit
accessibility. Tabulating by deciles (Table 3) produces lower counts than by low
transit accessibility (Table 4) due to how low accessibility was defined. We also
looked at cross-tabs of counts by deciles of access to low-income jobs instead of access
to all jobs. Percent difference between cells of the table for access to all jobs compared
to low-income jobs did not exceed 8%, with a mean percent difference of only 2%.
This is not presented due to similarity in results.

We now analyze the characteristics of areas that are at risk of transport poverty in
order to support discussion and policy recommendations. We first classify Dissemination Areas (DA) in terms of their risk of experiencing transport poverty. Theoretically, transport poverty is more likely to occur where there is low transit accessibility
and lower levels of SES. For the scope of this paper, we simplify to assume that areas
at risk of transport poverty are those with low transit access to employment, and
have high counts of people living under the regionally adjusted low-income cut-off
(LICO). We use the compounding effect of these two variables to classify DAs into
four categories of risk of transport poverty (low, moderate, high, and very high). The
classification was based on the assumption that both transit accessibility and prevalence of low-income residents contribute linearly to the risk of transport poverty.
This relationship is visualized Figure 1 in a linear plot and log-log plot. Overall, 12%
of DAs are classified as very high risk and 23% as high risk of transport poverty.
Toronto and Vancouver have the greatest percent of their DAs at high risk of transport poverty, and the smaller cities of Winnipeg and Quebec have the lowest (see
Table 5). Toronto and Vancouver are also the two cities which have been reported
on the most in terms of experiencing rising housing costs and sub-urbanization of
poverty (Ades et al., 2012, 2016).

Lastly, we conduct a k-means cluster analysis of zones at risk of transport poverty
in order to generate a typology that can be used for policy recommendations. Specifically we cluster on DAs that we classified as high or very high risk of transport poverty.
We cluster these DAs using seven relevant variables; access to jobs by transit, access
to jobs by car, population density, percent of population living in apartments, number of residents in low-income households, percent of residents living in new housing
stock (built since 2000), and the percent who have moved recently (from 2011 to
2016). The resulting number of clusters (k = 2) was determined by generating a
Scree plot, and then selecting the k where the graph provides the greatest change in
slope. The means of the variables selected in the cluster analysis for the two resulting
groups are displayed in Table 6. Table 6 also shows the number of DAs in each category, and the number of DAs that were previously categorized as being high or very
high risk of transport poverty. There is a greater proportion of DAs that have a very
high risk of transport poverty in the first group, which also has greater population
density and high percent of people living in apartments.

We can summarize by saying that there are two main typologies of areas in
which people are at a high risk of experiencing transport poverty. One are areas with
high population density, primarily people living in older apartments, with very high
concentrations of low income residents, who were more likely to have moved recently,
and who have average levels of transit access to employment (Group A). The second
(Group B) are more peripheral, typical suburban single family housing, low density
neighbourhoods, with extremely low levels of transit accessibility, have a wider gap
between the relative level of transit accessibility to auto accessibility, more likely to
be living in newer housing stock, but have fewer low income residents. Put simply,
transport poverty is most apparent in very dense, low-income, tower-neighbourhoods
located off of the main axes of transit supply, or wherever low income populations
live in low-density suburban urban forms across the nation.

Our research shows that while there are not systemic vertical inequalities in transit
accessibility, there are still a substantial number of low-income Canadians living in
areas of low transit accessibility. We estimate that 40% of all low-income residents
in these cities are at risk of transport poverty, 5% of the overall population, and
nearly one million people in total. The literature explains that the compounding
effects of low transit accessibility and low SES increase the risks of transport poverty,
potentially limiting people in their ability to travel to and participate in daily activities, including finding and retaining employment (Preston & Rajé, 2007; Paez et al.,
2009; Lucas, 2012). Investing in public transport to improve accessibility, particu-

inequalities, limit barriers to activity participation, and foster social and economic

This leads to the broad conclusion that transport policy in Canadian cities should
focus towards improving transit service to low accessibility neighbourhoods, with particular focus towards those neighbourhoods with more low-income households since
they are more likely to be reliant on transit. Unfortunately, there is only a limited
amount of funds and resources available for improving public transportation in Canadian cities. Certainly, this points towards advocating for increasing public funding
for public transit service, either through raising taxes (e.g. like gas taxes or congestion charges) or re-allocation of government spending from other infrastructure (e.g.
shift spending from highways to transit). However, it would be quixotic to think
that there will be a sufficient amount of funds for desirable levels of public transit
provision in urban areas across Canada in the near future. The prevailing challenge of
urban transportation planning is deciding how to allocate scarce funds and resources
to where they are to be the most effective.

The previous section indicates that there are two types of areas at risk of transport poverty. The first group have high levels of population density (e.g in apartment
towers) and high concentration of low income residents. These are usually located in
the ”inner-suburbs” of urban areas, and typically already have some transit service in
place, but the existing service is low relative to the socioeconomic status and density
of residents. Due to greater density, improving transit accessibility in these areas
would be the most effective in reducing risks of transport poverty for a large group
of people. Indeed, those areas with particularly high concentrations would be ideal
candidates for new rapid or regional transit stations. However, this would only be
realistic solution in a few locations given the high capital costs of such infrastructure.
For most areas, more cost effective solutions should be considered for upgrading existing service. One would be increased frequency on existing bus routes by adding more
vehicles to limit wait times, particularly for routes with large headways. Travel times
could also be reduced by implementing express lines which make fewer intermittent
stops. Another cost-effective solution would be to alter the design of roads to incorporate dedicated bus lanes (i.e. BRT), to depose delay caused by auto congestion.
The majority of suburban arterial roads in Canada have ample room to implement
dedicated bus lanes, a convenience of the unbridled auto-oriented planning of the
previous decades. Planning new routes, or upgrading existing routes, should not be
offset by reducing or re-routing other existing bus routes relied upon by lower-income
residents, which has unfortunately been the case in American cities like Los Angeles
(Grengs, 2002) and Salt Lake City (Farber & Fu, 2017).

Improving transit accessibility in lower density, single-family housing areas is a
greater challenge given the greater dispersement of individuals. In these regions, many
transit agencies opt for coverage rather than directness in their design of suburban

19

transit routes. It may be possible that faster, more direct, routes in some instances
will have a greater potential in providing greater accessibility, depending on the spatial distribution of transit need in the region (Walker, 2012). Transit networks should
also focus on providing better links to suburban employment locations. Many suburban employment areas currently have sparse transit service, despite recent growth in
employment numbers and suburb-to-suburb commuting (Blais, 2015).

Another potential solution, or as an augmentation to other solutions, is to provide subsidies for ride-sharing or implement demand responsive transit services. This
could be beneficial in lower-density suburban areas, where implementing traditional
fixed-route transit service has substantial monetary costs, or in areas where there is a
last mile problem. A few regions have begun to experiment with this type of service.
For example, the growing town of Innisfil (north of Toronto), recently partnered with
Uber to subsidize an on-demand ride-sharing service, as a more economical alternative
to developing traditional, fixed-route, transit service (Town of Innisfil, 2017). While
this may be a solution for alleviating transport poverty in areas with less demand, it
may not be applicable in urban areas where there is already heavy congestion or a
greater need for adding higher capacity transit (Mageean & Nelson, 2003). Evaluating
the success of such projects however will provide useful knowledge on how and where
demand responsive transit could be implemented elsewhere in Canada, and whether
it can be appropriately scaled if demand for transit increases.

In conjunction to the aforementioned recommendations for transit improvement,
municipalities and regional planners should also enforce land use policies which restrict urban sprawl and zone for urban intensification and mixed-use development,
in order to help reduce commute times and auto-dependency. This should include
planning any future development of housing for low-income residents and recent immigrants to be in areas with high transit accessibility. This should also include focusing
some employment growth in areas which have existing transit service, but have low accessibility metrics due to a local absence of jobs - areas where there are an abundance
of labourers who currently have to travel further to find employment. These ideas of
”smart growth” and denser, transit-oriented development, are often cited by urban
planners to reduce congestion and environmental impacts (Bernick & Cervero, 1997).
This sphere of development strategies can also reduce risks of transport poverty by
providing more nearby opportunities.

Lastly, it is possible that in the long term, providing better transit accessibility
to a neighbourhood could increase demand and costs for housing. This would likely
first affect low-income people in these areas for whom transit is the only option for
daily travel. Rising costs could then result in displacement to less accessible areas.
This indicates the importance of policy directed towards maintaining stability and
affordability of housing costs, in order to break any cycles of displacement. This also
shows the importance of ensuring minimum standards of accessibility across an entire
region, given uncertainties of housing markets and living costs in the future.

In this study, we examined inequalities in transit access to employment for eight
Canadian metropolitan regions. We find that neighbourhoods of lower SES, on average, have higher levels of transit access to employment than the overall population.
These trends are similar across all eight cities, but are less apparent in the larger
cities of Toronto and Vancouver, which have faced more gentrification and dispersion
of poorer populations into suburban areas. Despite an overall positive outlook, there
are still many households at risk of experiencing transport poverty. We estimate that
there are nearly one million urban Canadians living in low-income households who are
also living in areas of low transit accessibility. This accounts to 5% of the population
in these regions.

Recommendations to reduce inequalities in transit accessibility and limit risks
of transport poverty include focusing future transit investments in areas which have
high concentrations of low-income households and low levels of transit accessibility,
upgrading bus levels of service, intensification and diversity of land-use to increase
accessibility and reduce commute distances, as well as a consideration of subsidizing
ride-sharing or implementing demand-responsive transit in areas of low density. Doing
so could help reduce the risks of transport poverty and social exclusion. Given recent
and likely continuing growth of poverty in the suburbs, it is imperative that these
regions have adequate transit service, not only to find employment opportunities, but
to participate in other daily activities constituting a high quality of life.

This study used access to employment as a proxy measure for the distribution of
transit benefits across multiple regions. We do not contend that this research shows
a direct link between transport investments and employment outcomes, as this is
dependent on many other factors such as education, social networks, skill development, and other services aimed at reducing barriers to employment. Future research
that explores the impacts of jobs accessibility on employment outcomes could adopt
the accessibility measures in this study, but should additionally focus on matching
the skills of unemployed jobs seekers with available job openings during accessibility
calculations, rather than analyzing the locations of the overall labour force and employment. However, from our knowledge, comprehensive data for job seekers and job
openings does not exist Canada-wide. This highlights that the Canadian transport
policy sector needs to advocate to make detailed employment data available to researchers in order to advance analysis beyond existing studies which rely on aggregate
census data. If available, this additional information, along with greater consideration for travel costs and reduced willingness to travel for lower SES households, would
provide a deeper understanding of the who and where of transport poverty in Canada,
and be more effective at aiding policy aimed at poverty reduction.

While applied to Canadian cities, this paper adds to the literature by detailing

21

a methodology for accounting for transport poverty. From our knowledge, a largescale, multi-city accounting of transport poverty has not been conducted anywhere
in the world. We also outlined a novel method for generating descriptive typologies
of transport poor neighbourhoods that can directly inform policy recommendations.
The methods detailed on accounting for transport poverty and describing transport
poor neighbourhoods could be similarly be applied elsewhere. This is highly relevant
as concern regarding transport poverty is escalating in regions around the world.
Moreover, the policy discussion provided in our paper is applicable to other regions,
particularly for urban areas in the United States, Australia, and Europe which have
similar transport and land use patterns as Canadian cities.
