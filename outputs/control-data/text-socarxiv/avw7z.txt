Human mobility, both short and long term, are important considerations in the study of numerous

15

systems. Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global

16

community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on

17

human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data

18

remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the

19

fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year

20

census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level)

21

to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer

22

spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling

23

approach bridges a significant gap in the availability of migration data at administrative unit

24

levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread

25

availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach

26

opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels

27

across many other countries where such data are currently lacking.

1. INTRODUCTION

31

Human mobility, both short- and long-term, are increasingly recognized as important drivers for

32

many processes of societal importance including demographics, economics, regional

33

development, and epidemiology. Human migration, along with births and deaths, determine

34

population dynamics at both national and sub-national scales [1]. Macro- and micro-level

35

economic studies have identified migration as a driver of labor flow [2], while human movement,

36

along with movement of goods and ideas, has driven economic integration and development

37

across regions [3, 4]. Urban and regional development plans seek to meet growing demands for

38

infrastructure and services with the aim of accommodating the movement of people and goods to

39

new expansion regions [5]. Furthermore, as people move from place to place, they carry a

40

multitude of infectious agents with them, enhancing the potential for increased disease

41

transmission and enabling diseases to spread into new regions [6, 7].

42
43

Human mobility has been modeled using a variety of data sources including census [8, 9], road

44

and air transport network [9, 10], and mobile phone data [11, 12]. Currently, large differences

45

exist among countries regarding the availability of input data for modeling and better

46

understanding human mobility across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Indeed, while there is

47

an abundance of such data in high-income countries, they are either not available or difficult to

48

access in many low- and middle-income settings. Even census-based migration data,

49

representing reliable proxies for the relative strength of within country short-term human

50

connectivity across multiple temporal scales [7, 13], are often only available at rather course

51

spatial scales; rendering them inappropriate for many applications, including modeling infectious

52

disease dynamics, which require understanding human mobility at much finer spatial scales. For

2

53

example, the spread of Zika in Colombia shows much greater heterogeneity at the municipal

54

level than at the departmental level [14, 15] and thus understanding human mobility and the

55

relative strength of connectivity at the department level in this setting is less than ideal for

56

modeling Zika and other disease pathogen movements [16]. In this context, to enable the use of

57

migration data available at a coarser spatial scale than the one matching the needs of the system

58

of interest, inferential tools must be used to predict migration at finer spatial scales that can be

59

used for better (i) understanding infectious disease dynamics, in relation to population

60

movement, and (ii) supporting their control and elimination planning.

61
62

While migration may take place for a variety of reasons, it can broadly be generalized that

63

people migrate seeking to maximize profits while minimizing costs [17]. Multiple studies have

64

broken down the cost-benefit considerations of the push and pull factors into socio-demographic

65

[18], socio-political [19], economic [20], geographic [21, 22], and climatic and environmental

66

factors [18, 23]. Human migration has been modeled as a function of these factors with varying

67

complexities using the gravity model [24], a spatial interaction model that has been widely used

68

in studying the flow of trades [25, 26], labor [27, 28], road traffic [29], communications [30] ,

69

infections [9, 31, 32], and indeed human migration [33, 34]. As it applies to human migration,

70

the gravity model’s basic structure assumes that migration is proportional to the population size

71

at the origin and destination, and inversely proportional to the distance between these two

72

locations [24]. The Zipf’s basic gravity model has been subsequently extended to account for

73

additional push and pull factors, including geographic, socio-demographic, economic, and

74

environmental characteristics of the origins and destinations [18]. These advanced spatial

75

interaction models have contributed greatly to better understand the absolute and relative

3

76

importance of locations’ characteristics as measures of attractiveness and repulsiveness beyond

77

their population size and distance [8, 33].

78
79

In this study, we developed a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for Colombia using

80

previously identified economic, socio-demographic and geographic factors including the regional

81

equivalent of the gross domestic product, relative population size, proportion of urban population

82

and geographic contiguity of locations, in addition to the absolute population size and distance

83

between locations. We fitted a municipality level (i.e., Admin-2 level) model to observed census-

84

based department level (i.e., Admin-1 level) migration data. This means that we estimated the

85

model coefficients that multiply the covariates at the municipality level for predicting migration

86

at the municipality level, and subsequently aggregated the predictions at the department level

87

(please refer to subsection 2.5 for further details). We used a logistic regression model with

88

coefficients estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a Bayesian approach to

89

statistical inference. Our modeling approach (i) bridges a significant gap in the availability of

90

migration data either not collected or not available at a sufficiently fine spatial scale, with

91

potential application in many countries, and (ii) further provides a novel framework for using

92

course migration data to predict migration at finer spatial scales.

2. DATA AND METHODS

95

2.1. Migration Data

96

We extracted census-based internal migration data for Colombia from the most recent census

97

microdata available through the online Integrated Public Use Microdata Series-International

98

(IPUMSI) database [35], These data are based on a 10-percent sample of the whole 2005 census

4

99

and contain information about the department of residence of the respondents both in the census

100

year and five years prior to the census. The data served as a proxy for the number of migrants to

101

and from each one of the 32 Colombian departments the data are provided for. Indeed, while

102

there are 33 departments in Colombia, migration data pertaining to two of them (i.e., Vaupes and

103

Guainía) are aggregated with respect to the department of residence in the census year. We also

104

used migration data, pertaining to 533 census units, representing single municipality and groups

105

of contiguous municipalities whose population totaled at least 20,000 in 1993

106

(https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details/country/co#co2005a), which

107

were extracted from the same 10-percent sample of the 2005 census. However, since the groups

108

of municipalities used to identify the place of residence five years prior to the census do not

109

spatially match those used to identify the place of residence in the census year, we had to merge

110

together some of the contiguous groups of municipalities, while aggregating the associated

111

migration information, to make the two spatial datasets consistent over time. This resulted in 276

112

uniquely identifiable and temporally consistent census units including 147 single municipality

113

and 129 multi-municipality units – with 5% of origin and destination pairs happening within the

114

same department, and thus representing intra-departmental migration flows at the intermediate

115

level.

116
117

2.2. Population data

118

We used the Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4) population count dataset [36] referring

119

to the year 2005 and having a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1km at the

120

equator). We extracted the population figures for the 32 departments and 1,122 municipalities in

121

Colombia using the corresponding departmental and municipal administrative boundary

5

122

shapefiles obtained from the National Geographical Information System of Colombia [37]. We

123

also used the 2000/2001 MODIS 500 m Global Urban Extent dataset [38], having a resolution of

124

15 arc seconds (approximately 500 m at the equator), to estimate the proportion of urban

125

population in each department, multi-municipality unit, and municipality.

126
127

2.3. Economic data

128

To account for socioeconomic differences between administrative units, which are potentially

129

associated with human migration, we used the G-Econ (4.0) dataset (Nordhaus, 2006). In

130

particular, we used the 2005 gridded Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted Gross Cell Product

131

(GCP) dataset having a resolution of 1-degree (approximately 111 km at the equator). To express

132

gridded PPP values on a per capita basis, we divided them by the corresponding grid cell

133

population; with the latter derived from the 2005 Gridded Population of the World (v3) count

134

dataset [39] resampled to 1-degree. We choose this version of gridded population data given that

135

it was originally used to calculate the 2005 gridded PPP values (Nordhaus, 2006). Grid cells with

136

missing values were imputed with the mean of the surrounding eight grid cell values. Once we

137

obtained a complete grid layer at a resolution of one-degree, we resampled the layer, without

138

smoothing, to a resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~5km) before extracting the average value for

139

each department, multi-municipality unit, and municipality.

140
141

2.4. Geographic Data

142

QGIS software [40] was used to calculate Euclidean distances among population-weighted

143

centroids of each department, multi-municipality unit and municipality. This was done after

144

projecting the corresponding shapefiles to a customized projected coordinate system to minimize

6

145

linear distortion within the study area. To record the contiguity between each spatial unit in the

146

three groups listed above, we generated a binary variable with a value of 1 if two units share a

147

boundary and of 0 otherwise.

148
149

2.5. Fitting a novel spatial interaction model

150

Given that the migration data extracted from the IPUMSI database are based only on a 10-

151

percent sample of the whole census, we used a logistic regression to model the proportion of

152

people migrating between departments during the 5-year timespan the migration data refer to

153

(i.e., 2000-2005). While the IPUMSI migration data refer to the number of people residing in

154

department J (destination) who resided in department I (origin) five years prior to the census, for

155

ease of interpretation, we transformed the data to account for proportion of people who moved

156

from department I to department J over the same time frame. Accordingly, our model can be

157

used to predict the proportion of people migrating between each pair of municipalities as follow:

158
159
160

𝑌"# ~ 𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙(𝑁" , 𝑃"# )
𝑃"# =

∑5 ∑7 45 657
89 ∑5 45

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡<𝑣>? @ = 𝛽B +𝛽D 𝑑>? + 𝛽F 𝑁> + 𝛽G 𝑁? + ∑8HIJ 𝛽H 𝑋H ,

(1)
(2)
(3)

161
162

where YIJ is the observed number of people who migrated from department I to J, NI is the

163

population in department I, PIJ is the estimated proportion of people in department I who

164

migrated to department J based on aggregated municipality level migration estimates.

165

First, we predicted vij, the proportion of migrants from each municipality i in the department I to

166

each municipality j in department J, using equation (3), where β0,…,βn are regression

167

coefficients, dij is the distance between the municipalities of origin i and destination j, Ni and Nj
7

168

represent the total population at the origin and destination municipalities respectively, and Xk are

169

the covariates used in the model. Second, we estimated PIJ, the proportion of people in

170

department I who migrated to department J, using equation (2), where Ni is the population in

171

each municipality i in the department I, and nJ is the number of destination municipalities in

172

department J. Finally, we used PIJ to compute the likelihood as described in the next subsection.

173
174

2.6. Likelihood function

175

Because our final goal was to predict municipality level migration proportions, the log-likelihood

176

calculations were similarly done in two hierarchical steps. First, equation (3) was used for

177

predicting migration proportions at the municipality level, which we refer to as vij. Second,

178

equation (2) was used to convert the migration proportions to migration flows at the municipality

179

level Nivij, aggregate them to their respective departments of origin I and destination J, and

180

estimate the proportion of people in department I who migrated to department J, which we refer

181

to as PIJ. To enable fitting the aggregated proportion PIJ at the department level, we defined the

182

log-likelihood of the model coefficients as:

183

𝐿𝐿 = M M 𝑀"# 𝑙𝑛 𝑙𝑛 <𝑃"# @ + (𝑁" − 𝑀"# )𝑙𝑛 (1 − 𝑃"# ) + 𝐾
"

(4)

#

184

for I ≠ J, where MIJ is the census-based number of people in department J who moved from

185

department I, NI is the population size at department I, and a constant 𝐾 =𝑙𝑛 𝑙𝑛 (𝑁" !) −

186

𝑙𝑛 𝑙𝑛 <𝑀"# !@ − 𝑙𝑛 (<𝑁# − 𝑀"# @!).

2.7. Coefficient estimation

190

We estimated our model coefficients using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian

191

approach implemented according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [41, 42] in the Bayesian

192

Tools package in R [43]. Parameters included in the models (i.e., coefficients of the logistic

193

regression models) correspond to distance between origin and destination, population at the

194

origin and destination, and additional covariates included using a stepwise forward model

195

selection approach (Table 1). Prior to fitting the model, we scaled all continuous explanatory

196

variables to obtain a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.5. Categorical binary variables were

197

transformed to have a mean of 0 and a range of 1. This process helped stabilize parameter

198

estimates for some of the large-value variables (e.g., population and distances) and resulted in

199

model coefficients that could be compared across variables. For each coefficient, we assumed a

200

Cauchy prior distribution centered at 0 with a scale parameter value of 2.5, except for the

201

intercept, which was set to have a scale parameter value of 10. This assumes that extremely large

202

coefficients (greater than 5 in logistic regression for centered variables) are highly unlikely [44].

206

2.8. Model selection

207

Starting with the Zipf’s gravity model, representing the most basic spatial interaction model

208

accounting only for distance between origin and destination and their population, we used a

209

stepwise forward selection to identify the best predictive model with the lowest Deviance

210

Information Criterion (DIC). For each candidate model, we ran the MCMC procedure five times,

211

each from different initial conditions, which enabled us to assess convergence of the parameter

212

values and calculate the DIC more robustly. Accordingly, each chain was run for 1.5 x 105 steps,

213

with the first half constituting the burn-in that we excluded from our posterior distribution. Our

214

posterior distribution was then generated from the remaining MCMC samples by thinning every

215

10 steps in each chain. All parameter initializations and proposals were done using the Bayesian

216

Tools package in R [43]. We assessed convergence of each parameter using the Gelman-Rubin

217

diagnostic [45]. Thus, starting from with the most basic spatial interaction model, we arbitrary

218

included one variable at a time, fit the new model and computed the DIC with values lower by at

219

least 10 considered significant improvements. We compared all DIC values computed based on

220

all combinations at a fixed number of covariates and carry on with the combination with the

221

lowest DIC value. We continued the model selection procedure until we started to get worse DIC

222

values at each step of variable inclusion from the remaining set.

223
224

We then tested three different spatial interaction modeling approaches (Figure 1): (1) a fine-scale

225

model at the municipality level fitted to observed data available at department level, with

10

226

migration proportions predicted at the municipality level (please also refer to subsection 2.5) , (2)

227

a broad-scale model at the department level fitted to observed data available at the department

228

level, with proportions predicted at the same level, and (3) an intermediate-scale model (i.e.,

229

based on the 147 municipalities and 129 multi-municipality units described in subsection 2.1)

230

fitted to observed data available at the same intermediate level, with proportions predicted at the

231

intermediate level.

Figure 1: Schematic of the three spatial interaction modeling approaches and subsequent
validation. In the first approach (fine-scale), model coefficients are estimated at the municipality
level (C) and used to predict municipality level migration proportions, which are subsequently
converted to migration flows and aggregated to the corresponding departments of origin and
destination. The estimated department level flows are then converted back to proportions which
are fitted to observed department level migration proportions (A). In the second approach (broadscale), model coefficients are estimated at the department level (D) yielding in predicted

migration proportions which are fitted to observed department level migration proportions (A).
In the third approach (intermediate-scale), model coefficients are estimated at the intermediate
level (E), migration proportions are predicted at the intermediate level, and finally fitted to
observed intermediate level migration proportions (B). Finally, for validation purpose, estimated
municipality level migration flows, based on the results of the fine-scale model, are aggregated at
the intermediate level and compared to observed intermediate level migration flows (B). Lightred broken lines represent the process of aggregating at the intermediate level for validation
which is separate from the process of aggregation for model fitting - shown in solid red.

249

2.9. Model validation

250

To validate our fine-scale model results obtained in the absence of observed municipality level

251

migration data, we used the observed data available at the intermediate level, based on 276

252

census units including 147 single municipalities and 129 multi-municipalities extracted from the

253

2005 census (Figure 1 B; please also refer to subsection 2.1). We used the best model selected at

254

the municipality level (i.e., fine-scale model) to predict migration proportions at the municipality

255

level, converted them to municipality level migration flows and aggregate the latter to the

256

corresponding intermediate level, and finally compared the resulting estimated intermediate level

257

migration flows to the corresponding observed flows derived from the 2005 census. To validate

258

the intermediate level migration flows based on the broad-scale model, we assumed that

259

migration proportions predicted at the department level can be uniformly disaggregated within

260

each department and thus assigned the same proportion to all single municipalities and multi-

261

municipalities located within each department.

262
263

3. RESULTS

264

3.1 Fine-scale model

265

Our best fine-scale model, selected using the forward-selection method described in section 2.8,

266

had all covariates related to the destination significantly associated with migration, except for

12

267

percentile of population (PERCj) and the economic status (GECONj) (Table 2). Urban

268

proportion (URBANPROPi) and economic status (GECONi) were the only origin-related

269

covariates with a significant contribution towards migration (p-value <0.001), along with the

270

origin’s population size (Table 1). All coefficients in the best model showed convergence in our

271

diagnosis based on the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic [45], all having potential scale reduction factor

272

of approximately 1.0 (Figure S1).

277

In all three models, the fact that all covariates in our fitting datasets were normalized to obtain a

278

mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.5 (or range of 1, when categorical) enable us to compare

279

the magnitude of each coefficient values and interpret them as a measure of their relative

280

importance. Our results showed that the distance between origin and destination was the most

281

important covariate with the highest negative effect, with a coefficient value of -2.47 (95% CI: -

282

2.49 − -2.45). Contiguity (CONTij) and the destination’s status of being a major population

283

center (MajCenj) had the second and third largest positive contributions towards migration,

284

having coefficients of 2.16 (95% CI: 2.12−2.19) and 1.54 (95% CI: 1.48 − 1.6), respectively.

285

Urban proportion at destination and origin were also important, with coefficient of 0.76 (95% CI:
13

286

0.75 − 0.77) and -0.68 (95% CI: -0.71 − -0.65) respectively, suggesting mostly-urban

287

municipalities as preferential destinations and mostly-rural municipalities as sources of migrants.

288

Not only being a mostly rural municipality but representing a tiny population center as well was

289

associated with generating migrants, with a coefficient of -0.76 (95% CI: -0.83− -0.7).

290

Population sizes had mixed effects on migration, with the origin population (POPi) showing a

291

positive effect with a coefficient of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.15 − 0.17) and the destination population

292

(POPj) showing a negative effect with a coefficient value of -0.124 (95% CI: -0.126 − -0.122)

293

(Figure 1, in red). Our results of significant effect of both distance and contiguity between origin

294

and destination and the opposing effects of urban proportion at origin and destination, as well as

295

the effect of poor economic activities at the origin, suggest that urban economic centers are more

296

likely to attract migrants from close, rural municipalities with low economic activity.

297
298

3.2 Model comparison across spatial scales

299

To further examine differences with respect to determinants of migration across spatial scales,

300

we used the structure of the best-fit fine-scale model to (a) fit a model based on the broad-scale

301

approach and (b) fit a model based on the intermediate-scale approach. Our results show that the

302

models based on the broad- and intermediate-scale approaches, while having few similarities in

303

terms of magnitude and sign of the coefficients, have several differences compared to the fine-

304

scale model. For instance, there were differences between the fine-scale and broad-scale models

305

in the magnitudes and signs of the coefficients for POPi, POPj, URBANPROPi, MAJCENj and

306

GECONi, and in the magnitudes of the coefficients for DISTij and CONTij (Figure 2). In

307

contrast, while there were large differences between the fine-scale and intermediate-scale models

308

in the magnitude of coefficients for DISTij, CONTij, URBANPROPi, URBANPROPj and POPi,

309

they only showed a sign difference in the coefficients for TINYj and GECONi. These results
14

310

suggest that while migration at the three spatial levels exhibit different characteristics, as

311

expected, the fine-scale migration patterns are relatively more similar to those at the intermediate

312

scale and less similar to those at the broad scale.

Overall, fine-scale model covariates that showed more similarity with the intermediate-scale

319

model than with the broad-scale model included (a) factors that, according to our model,

320

encouraged emigration such as contiguity between the origin and destination, origin’s higher

321

population size, lower urban proportion and poorer economic status, and (b) factors that

322

encouraged immigration such as the destination’s low population size, and being a major

323

population center. Distance between origin and destination and urban proportion at destination

324

were the only two fine-scale factors that showed more similarity with the broad-scale model than

325

with the intermediate-scale model.

broad-scale model

329

Our estimated migration flows between any pair of municipalities, based on the fine-scale model,

330

were aggregated to the department level and compared to the observed department level

331

migration flows derived from the 2005 census. This resulted in a Pearson’s correlation

332

coefficient of 0.84, as compared to 0.89 based on the results of the broad-scale model. These

333

results demonstrate a good fit, comparable to those we would get based on the best broad-scale

334

model (Figure 3), especially for routes with high observed migrations (Figure 4).

We further compared the estimated migration flows aggregated to the department level to the

348

corresponding observed flows to all possible destinations. Our results showed a good fit when
17

349

compared to the observed migration flows, especially for departments characterized by relatively

350

higher incoming flows (Figure 5A-C). For departments characterized by relatively lower

351

incoming flows, our results seem to overestimate migration (Figure 5D).

Our municipality level migration flow estimates, based on the fine-scale model, show a pattern

365

of migration into major municipalities in Colombia including Bogota, Cali, and Medellin.

366

However, there are also other significant migration routes to other relatively smaller

367

municipalities in departments with relatively higher economic activity, such as Pereira in the

368

department of Risaralda, or regional economic centers, such as Neiva in the department of Huila,

369

Cucuta in the department of North Santander, and Monteria in the department of Cordoba

370

(Figure 6A−6B). These results further demonstrate the importance of urban centers and the

371

economic opportunities they present as the main pull factors driving migrations at the

372

municipality level. Note that similar patterns were observed at the department level, with those

373

including major urban municipalities and representing economically strong departments

374

attracting the largest share of migrants across Colombia (Figure 4 A and B).

384

Observed intermediate level migration flows, pertaining to 276 census units (please refer to

385

subsection 2.1), were compared to estimated intermediate level migration flows obtained by

386

aggregating our estimated municipality level flows based on the fine-scale and broad-scale

387

model. Our estimated intermediate level migration flows based on the fine-scale model show a

388

better correlation to the observed intermediate level migration flows than those based on the

389

broad-scale model and those based on the intermediate-scale model (Figure 7 A-C). Considering

390

the fact that these estimated intermediate level migration flows were produced without using the

391

validation data (i.e., without using the observed intermediate level migration flows), and that

392

comparisons of estimated flows from the three models (fine, intermediate-, and broad-scale) are

393

subject to inevitable biases due to their different scales (and level of aggregation), our results

394

demonstrate the robustness of the fine-scale model. Our results also show relatively good

395

correlation between our estimated municipality level flows based on the fine-scale model and

396

observed municipality level flows pertaining only to the 147 single-municipalities included in the

397

intermediate level data (Figure 7D; please also refer to subsection 2.1). Further comparisons of

398

the residuals reveal that the fine-scale model provides a better fit (based on correlation)

399

comparable to those obtained by fitting the intermediate-level data (Figure 7E-H).

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

411

In this study, we have assessed the factors that drive migration patterns within Colombia and

412

proposed a novel spatial interaction modeling approach to predict migration at a finer spatial

413

scale than the one at which migration data are either recorded or made available. Our spatial

414

interaction model is unconstrained both at the origin and destination sides (i.e. not normalized

415

over the total inflows/outflows to/from each location), and thus could potentially result in over

416

predictions. At the same time, our novel approach provides a much-needed flexibility to

417

potentially predict the total inflows/outflows to/from each location at any scale, as opposed to

418

being constrained by observed total inflows and outflows at a fixed spatial scale[46–48]. This

419

would enable predict migration at a finer scale than the one at which migration data are generally

420

available. Our approach also assumes that observed migration patterns are relatively stable and

421

not influenced by large unobserved events.

422
423

Our estimated department level migration flows based on the fine-scale model (i.e., based on

424

estimated municipality level migration flows aggregated to the department level) demonstrated a

425

good agreement with the observed department level migration flows extracted from the 2005

426

census (Figure 3-5). At the municipality level, our results provided estimated migration flows

427

among the 1,122 municipalities in Colombia with 18% of migrations happening within the same

428

department. Validation of these estimates using observed intermediate level migration flows

429

(based on 276 census units including 147 single municipality units) demonstrated that our

430

estimates are robust and comparable to those that would be obtained by fitting directly to the

431

intermediate level data (rather than holding them out for validation).

432
22

433

Comparison of our model at the department, intermediate, and municipality levels revealed

434

differences between the corresponding broad-scale, intermediate-scale and fine-scale model fits.

435

Distance between origin and destination was confirmed to be the most significant mediating

436

driver of migration, i.e. those that facilitate and consolidate migration [19], while its coefficient

437

values varied significantly across scales (Figure 2). The magnitude of distance’s effect on

438

migration in our fine-scale model is consistent with findings from other countries across the

439

world based on a classic gravity model with comparable population sizes and distances [47].

440

However, while increasing from broad-scale to intermediate-scale, consistently with those

441

findings from other countries, the effect of distance became lower at the fine-scale. This seems to

442

be due to the larger effects of other factors, including contiguity between origin and destination

443

and the urban/rural status of the latter, with both the broad-scale and intermediate-scale models

444

offsetting such effects by penalizing remote destinations.

445
446

The effect of population size in the best fine-scale model showed large population leading to

447

more emigration and less immigration. This was reinforced by the positive effect on migration of

448

the destination being among the lowest tenth percentile in population. At the same time, our best

449

fine-scale model showed increased migration towards destinations that are in the top 90th

450

percentile of population, which we labeled major population centers, in addition to strong

451

positive and moderate negative effects of urban proportions at the destination and origin,

452

respectively. These results suggest that, except for very few major population centers, population

453

movement is strongly characterized by movement from rural to urban administrative units [49]

454

and weakly by movement from higher to lower populated administrative units; with the latter

455

possibly as a result of model structure trying to offset the effect of other covariates with stronger

23

456

effects. Our results constitute an important deviation from the basic assumption of the gravity

457

model, which in its original form assumes larger population, both at origins and destinations,

458

leading to larger movements in both directions [24].

459
460

Regarding the effect of economic status, our best fine-scale model seems to show that migration

461

in Colombia is driven by economic depression at origins, but not necessarily by economic

462

attractiveness at destinations, suggesting a propensity to migrate as a result of deprivation at

463

origins and perceived economic opportunities at destinations [50]. Van Hear et al. (2018)

464

suggested a categorization of drivers of migration into predisposing, proximate, precipitating,

465

and mediating [19]. Our best fine-scale model includes predisposing drivers such as high and

466

low level of urbanization at the destination and origin, respectively, proximate drivers such as

467

lack of economic opportunities and population pressure at the origin, and mediating drivers such

468

as distance and contiguity between origin and destination.

469
470

Our modeling approach is not without limitations. Because aggregated municipality level

471

estimates were compared to observed department level data [50], which do not include intra-

472

department migration, the modeling approach may have systematically overestimated internal

473

migration within departments. This is because of the relative importance of distance in our best

474

fine-scale model, coupled with the close proximity among municipalities within a single

475

department. The fact that administrative units at different levels are formed arbitrarily, both in

476

terms of geographic size (which affects distances) and population (affecting many of the

477

covariates we used), our models may have biases arising from such effect (also known as

478

Modifiable Area Unit Problem). This problem might have contributed to discrepancies between

24

479

municipality-level, intermediate-level and department-level estimates and observed data. Note

480

that the intermediate level migration data are made up of single municipalities and groups of

481

contiguous municipalities, which, when comparing results, may create potential biases

482

depending on how each group was formed.

483
484

Although migration represents a form of long-term human mobility, it has been widely

485

demonstrated that migration data can serve as reliable proxies for the relative strength of human

486

connectivity across multiple temporal and spatial [7, 13]. Similarly, it has been suggested that

487

international migration provides added effect of enhancing shorter-term occupational mobility

488

[51]. Human mobility is an important factor in the study of several social, economic, political

489

and biological systems that operate at various temporal and spatial scales. In particular, global

490

health has been under a growing threat due to rapid spread of infectious diseases at continental

491

scales. The expansion of chikungunya since 2013 and the recent invasion by the Zika virus in the

492

Americas, for instance, have caused significant human suffering and economic losses in multiple

493

countries across the region [52, 53]. The spread of infectious diseases is often compounded by

494

the multitude of ways infected individuals travel, both locally and internationally, opening

495

opportunities for the disease to spread [8, 54]. Coupled with the ecology of several infectious

496

diseases, often characterized by significant heterogeneity at fine spatial scales [14, 15], the need

497

for estimating human mobility at fine spatial scales is well recognized. This study represents a

498

first contribution toward filling the gap about availability of fine-scale migration and human

499

mobility data in Colombia for supporting the research in the spread of infectious disease and

500

beyond. Furthermore, the spatial interactive modeling approach we used can be applied in many

25

501

other countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, characterized by

502

similar socio-economic conditions.
