(Martin 2016,293) offers the UK as an example of a location where executive particularism would be
expected to function. Thus, a Westminster-style parliamentary system would be not obviously be outside
the scope conditions for this theory.

There is an additional provision to appoint two members to represent the Anglo-Indian community, but
since these members are not elected, we do not consider them in this present study. (Nikolenyi 2014, 100).

Historically the Council of Ministers has also included Deputy Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries,
but the use of these positions has fallen out of practice in the contemporary era. (Jain 2003, 14).

Identification of repeat observations was complicated by the substantial number of observations and the
fact that candidate names were not always transliterated consistently from election to election. For
example, JD(U) MP Arjun Roy was identified as Arjun Rai in the 2014 election results while former BSP
MP Kaisar Jahan was identified as Kaiser Jahan in a subsequent election. When there were questions as to
whether a given pair of observations were of the same individual particularly when a candidate had
changed parties and constituencies between elections electoral affidavits maintained by the National
Election Watch (www.myneta.info)
address, education level and degree-granting institution, as well as age.

In keeping with (Martin 2016), if a party withdraws from the ruling coalition at some point before a
general election they are still coded as having been part of the government.

It makes no substantive difference to the results to separate Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha experience into
two separate variables.

These sets of fixed effects are strictly for control purposes and are not integral to the theoretical
