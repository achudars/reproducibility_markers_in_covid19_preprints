Eﬀects of Livestock Transfers*

Abstract
We evaluate a program in Guatemala oﬀering training and transfers of a local chicken variety using a randomized phase-in design with imperfect compliance. We do not ﬁnd strong
evidence for or against positive average intent-to-treat eﬀects on household-level outcomes, including indicators of expenditure, calorie and protein intake, diet quality, egg consumption and
production, as well as chicken ownership and management. Among girls between the ages of six
and 60 months, we ﬁnd that the program reduced stunting by 23.5 (± 19.4) percentage points, while
also improving other height and weight outcomes. Boys are more likely to suﬀer from intestinal
illness, which could explain diﬀerences in program impacts by gender. Using machine learning
methods, we show that the poorest households enjoyed the largest impacts on diet quality and
animal protein consumption, while children in the poorest households experienced the largest
impacts on the probability of consuming animal source foods. Larger eﬀects on animal source
food consumption among poorer households did not translate into greater impacts on height or
weight.

Introduction

Transferring chickens to poor households has attracted attention in the media (CNN, 2016) and in development policy circles (Gates, 2016) as a promising antipoverty tool. The enthusiasm stems partly
from the fact that a modest chicken ﬂock can generate income while requiring minimal investments
of time, money, or land, making small-scale poultry farming an appropriate enterprise for households with few resources (Sonaiya and Swan, 2004). Chicken transfers could also improve human
capital outcomes if they increase consumption of animal source foods among young children. Multicountry analysis from Headey, Hirvonen, and Hoddinott (2018) reveals a strong correlation between
animal source food consumption and child health, where the latter is measured by the incidence of
stunting. Poor child health can decrease earnings in adulthood, primarily through impaired cognitive development (Attanasio et al., 2018; Attanasio, Meghir, and Nix, 2019; Figlio et al., 2014; Hoddinott
et al., 2008). Egg consumption may be particularly eﬀective in improving child health, as eggs have
a better digestability-corrected amino acid proﬁle than meat, ﬁsh, or soy while also being rich in
micronutrients and fatty acids that are essential for brain development (Jin and Iannotti, 2014). But
caution is warranted, as increased poultry and livestock ownership can undermine child health gains
through increased exposure to pathogens contained in animal waste (Headey and Hirvonen, 2016;
Headey et al., 2017). Furthermore, chicken transfer programs could be quickly undone by unexpected
animal health shocks, as chickens are highly susceptible to disease.
We use machine learning and average intent-to-treat eﬀect estimation to evaluate the impacts
of a chicken transfer program in Guatemala. We examine two sets of outcomes: household-level indicators of expenditure, diet quality, nutrient intake, egg production, chicken ownership, and poultry
management, and individual-level indicators of body weight, height, diet, exposure to animal waste,
and intestinal illness among boys and girls who were between the ages of six and 60 months when
follow-up data were collected. The program studied here transferred a “chicken set” to participating
households in exchange for completing a poultry training program and meeting other requirements.
The chicken set included ten females and two males of the local “naked-neck” variety, a ﬁfty pound

1

bag of commercial chicken feed, forage plants for use once the feed supply was exhausted, and animal
health services.
We estimate program eﬀects using baseline and follow-up data from 14 clusters (18 communities
and 391 households) assigned to be early recipients of the program and 14 clusters (18 communities
and 400 households) randomly assigned to be late recipients of the program. Follow-up data were
collected in May 2017, 14 months after all but a negligible portion of chicken-recipient households
in the treatment group had received their chickens and one month after the start of chicken set distribution to the control group, where “treatment” and “control” refer to clusters selected to be early
and late recipients of the program, respectively. Participation was not randomized or compulsory
within communities. At follow-up, 46.3% of households in the treatment group sample had received
a chicken set at least 80 days earlier, which is the amount of time needed for program chickens to
begin producing eggs, versus 13.5% of households in the control group sample.
We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant average intent-to-treat eﬀects at the household level, but the
95% conﬁdence intervals around our estimates are too wide to be characterized as precise null eﬀects.
The slow pace of program implementation in communities assigned to the treatment group suggests
that impacts on some indicators may have dissipated before follow-up data were collected. We conclude that we do not have enough evidence to determine whether the program aﬀected householdlevel indicators, on average. In contrast, the program had large positive impacts on anthropometric
indicators for girls. Assignment to the treatment group raised the average weight-for-age and heightfor-age Z-scores by 0.349 standard deviations (± 0.281 standard deviations according to the 95% conﬁdence interval) and 0.539 standard deviations (± 0.433), respectively. Stunting among girls fell by
23.5 percentage points (± 19.4), an improvement of 57% relative to the control group. Severe stunting
among girls fell by 14.3 percentage points (± 13.1), a decrease of 18% relative to the control group. Impacts on girls are robust to multiple hypothesis testing adjustments, mode of inference, regression
speciﬁcation, and sample construction. Average impacts on anthropometric indicators for boys are
positive but small and imprecisely estimated. We speculate that the higher incidence of intestinal
illness among boys could explain diﬀerences in impacts on height and weight by gender. Relative to
2

girls between the ages of six and 60 months, boys were 23% more likely to have had intestinal illness
in the 30 days prior to follow-up interviews and had intestinal illness for almost one additional day
over the same time horizon, on average. Importantly, the program does not appear to have increased
intestinal illness or exposure to animal waste. Estimated average impacts on dietary indicators are
small and not statistically signiﬁcant for girls and boys.
To explore impacts that average intent-to-treat eﬀects may miss, we estimate heterogeneous
intent-to-treat eﬀects using machine learning methods (Chernozhukov et al., 2018b). At the household
level, we ﬁnd that the poorest households had the largest impacts on the food consumption score
(World Food Program, 2008) and consumption of animal protein. We also ﬁnd that children from the
poorest households enjoyed the largest impacts on the probability of consuming animal source foods
in the past day. We explore why the poorest children did not also enjoy the biggest positive eﬀects
on height and weight and present descriptive evidence for diﬀerences in hygiene and the incidence
of intestinal illness by wealth as oﬀering plausible explanations.
Our study adds to a growing literature on assessing livestock transfers. One large strand of
this literature studies the eﬀects of “graduation” programs oﬀering entrepreneurial training, life skills
coaching, regular home visits, a stipend, health services, and assets (usually livestock) to impoverished
women. Examples include Misha et al. (2019); Raza, de Poel, and Ourti (2018); Banerjee et al. (2015);
Roy et al. (2015); Emran, Robano, and Smith (2014); Bandiera et al. (2013); and Krishna, Poghosyan,
and Das (2012), among others. The vast majority of graduation evaluations focus on variants of a
single intervention—BRAC’s “Targeting the Ultra Poor” program in Bangladesh—and tend to ﬁnd
large positive eﬀects on income, assets, and food security. Among existing randomized control trial
evaluations of graduation programs, to our knowledge only Raza, de Poel, and Ourti (2018) evaluate
impacts on child height and weight. They ﬁnd that Targeting the Ultra Poor improves weight-forheight but not height-for-age. Given the bundle of interventions and variety of asset types included in
Targeting the Ultra Poor, it is diﬃcult to say what portion of its child health impacts can be attributed
to livestock.

A smaller strand of the livestock transfer literature evaluates programs oﬀering training and
livestock transfers with a “pass-on-the-gift” component, i.e., program participants must agree to pass
oﬀspring from transferred livestock to other households to receive program beneﬁts. Nearly all studies of pass-on-the-gift evaluate programs implemented by Heifer International. To our knowledge,
the lone exception is Glass et al.’s (2017) evaluation of a program that distributed pigs in Democratic
Republic of the Congo, where they ﬁnd positive eﬀects on ﬁnancial inclusion as well as self-reported
mental and physical health. A series of studies on Heifer International’s goat program in Nepal ﬁnd
positive eﬀects on ﬁnancial inclusion and women’s empowerment (Janzen et al., 2018) and suggestive
evidence for improved dietary diversity among children (Darrouzet-Nardi et al., 2016) as well as child
height and weight (Miller et al., 2016, 2014). A pair of evaluations of Heifer’s program oﬀering dairy
cows, draft cattle, and goats in Zambia ﬁnd that all three livestock types increase household expenditures while cows and goats increase dietary diversity (Jodlowski et al., 2016; Kaﬂe, Winter-Nelson, and
Goldsmith, 2016). Using propensity score matching, Rawlins et al. (2014) ﬁnd positive eﬀects of dairy
cows on child height and weight in Rwanda but no impacts of meat goats on these same outcomes.
We make three main contributions to the literature. First, we are aware of no other published
studies of livestock transfers that use machine learning to study treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. The
speciﬁc approach we use was developed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018b), and it allows us to examine
many potential dimensions of treatment eﬀect heterogeneity while limiting concerns over speciﬁcation searching and preserving valid inference.
Second, the context of the program studied here diﬀers substantially from that of existing livestock transfer evaluations, both in terms of the implementing agency and location. Virtually all previous evaluations of livestock transfers in the economics literature focus on programs administered by
non-governmental organizations with extensive implementation experience. We evaluate a program
managed by a government agency that had never previously attempted a large-scale livestock transfer program, and the implementer’s lack of experience was severely tested by a disease outbreak at
a program breeding facility. Furthermore, the existing evidence on livestock transfers comes almost
exclusively from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, with the exceptions of Honduras and Peru in
4

Banerjee et al. (2015). Guatemala has a substantially higher GDP per capita and is more urbanized than
Bangladesh, Nepal, Zambia, or Rwanda, for example (World Bank, 2019a,c). But Guatemala is characterized by extreme income inequality, with poverty heavily concentrated in rural areas (Guatemala
National Institute of Statistics, 2015). Among the countries studied in the literature reviewed above,
only Zambia and Honduras have larger Gini coeﬃcients (World Bank, 2019b).
Third, we use random variation in program implementation to identify impacts on child height
and weight in an environment where chronic malnutrition is rampant in rural areas. At 46.5%, Guatemala
has one of the highest rates of stunting in the world among children under ﬁve years of age (World
Food Program, 2018). By comparison, stunting rates in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Rwanda (the three
countries for which we have evidence on livestock transfers and child height) for children under ﬁve
are 36%, 38%, and 36%, respectively (National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, 2015; National Institute
of Population Research and Training, 2016; Nepal Ministry of Health, 2016).

Background

The program studied here was known as Recovery of Natural Capital of the Dry Corridor Region, and
was supported by the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank and
implemented by the Mancomunidad Copan Ch’orti’. The Mancomunidad is an association formed
by four municipalities in the Guatemalan department of Chiquimula that facilitates cooperation in
regional development projects. Chiquimula is located in the “Dry Corridor”, a region that stretches
from the southern tip of Mexico through Central America to Panama. Severe droughts aﬀected the
Dry Corridor during the agricultural years ending in 2013, 2014, and 2015, capped by an El Niñodriven drought in 2015-2016 characterized as the worst the region had seen in 30 years (El Nuevo
Diario, 2016; FAO, 2017). The population in Chiquimula is largely indigenous, reliant on agriculture,
and has a poverty rate of 71% (INE, 2015). Chiquimula has some of the highest rates of malnutrition
among children and overall food insecurity in Guatemala (Government of Guatemala, 2013). In the
2014-2015 National Survey of Maternal and Child Health, 55.6% of children in Chiquimula below ﬁve
5

years of age were stunted and 19.2% were underweight according to standards set by the World Health
Organization (2011), while 40.2% of children in Chiquimula between the ages of six and 60 months
were anemic (Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance, 2017).
The main objective of the program was to increase the resilience of households located in the
Guatemalan Dry Corridor. A major feature of the program was the creation of farmer ﬁeld schools
in communities to train households in basic grain production, agroforestry, adaptation to climate
change, and poultry management. Each topic was covered through weekly three-hour classes over
the course of eight weeks. A second major program component was the distribution of naked-neck
chickens. By breeding and distributing naked-neck chickens, the Mancomunidad sought to build
resilience for program participants while conserving a productive asset well-suited to the hot and
drought-prone conditions of the Dry Corridor.
Naked-neck chickens are especially productive in adverse conditions relative to other breeds.
In a laboratory experiment, Chen et al. (2004) found that normally-feathered chickens produce about
7% more eggs over a year (173 versus 161) than naked-neck chickens when the ambient temperature is
22°C. But at 32°C the additional ventilation provided by the naked-neck’s absence of neck feathers
results in 9.7% additional eggs produced (124 versus 113), higher average weight per egg (42.8 grams
versus 40 grams), and better maintenance of body weight (90% versus 85%). As discussed by Wong
et al. (2017), indigenous chicken varieties have co-evolved alongside their environments. We would
therefore expect naked-neck chickens to have advantages over specialized egg layers with respect to
disease resistance, the ability to scavenge for food, and avoidance of predators. Laboratory results
like those of Chen et al. (2004) will not fully translate to conditions in Chiquimula. But the Mancomunidad estimated that the ten hens given to each program participant receiving chickens could
produce around 500 eggs per year, suggesting a potentially large impact on access to animal source
foods.
Program implementation worked as follows. Mancomunidad personnel arrived at each community to conduct a household census, followed by a meeting to publicize the program and describe

6

the farmer ﬁeld schools and other program details. Communities too small to support their own
farmer ﬁeld schools were combined into clusters with other neighboring communities. Larger communities sometimes had multiple farmer ﬁeld schools. Households in the cohort studied in this article
were allowed to pick which modules they attended and any resident of the community served by a
farmer ﬁeld school (according to the program’s census) was eligible to enroll.
Each participating household received a chicken set if they satisﬁed the following criteria: nearperfect attendance at the local farmer ﬁeld school’s poultry sessions, constructing a hen house using
local materials, dedicating a small area to forage plants for their chickens, and signing a pledge to
transfer ten female and two male chickens back to the program once their birds began to reproduce
and their oﬀspring were old enough to be moved (i.e., pass-on-the-gift). The cost per household of
the chicken set, including training and all materials, was approximately $500 by 2018 and paid for by
the program.1 To put this ﬁgure in context, estimated annual expenditure per capita was $1,113 in 2017
for the households in our data set. While the program’s various components are directed at the entire
household, the individuals attending the poultry module and receiving chickens were all women.
By January 2018, the poultry component of the program had produced 147,340 birds and distributed
chickens to 4,239 households (Multilateral Investment Fund, 2018).
At each farmer ﬁeld school, the chickens received by the ﬁrst group of households to complete
the poultry module were raised by program technicians at a dedicated facility. Subsequent graduates of the poultry module received chickens that had been raised by earlier program participants
from the same cluster and later passed back to the program to satisfy the above-mentioned pledge.
In the present study, about 1% of households assigned to the treatment group and 3% of control group
households had received pass-on-the-gift birds when follow-up data were collected. Waiting for additional pass-on-the-gift transfers before collecting follow-up data would have further contaminated
the control group. In addition, 5% of households in the treatment group and 3% of households in
the control group participated in a program component other than chicken training and transfers
at follow-up. The Mancomunidad made attendance of all modules compulsory for future program

to beneﬁciary households through the program.

Evaluation design and data

All 133 communities located in the most drought-prone areas served by the Mancomunidad were
included in the program. Capacity constraints dictated that the program would be rolled out over
approximately ﬁve years. To that end, communities were divided into ﬁve cohorts. The Mancomunidad’s initial plan was to phase the program into one cohort per year, but implementation challenges
described below resulted in slow rollout for some cohorts and quicker implementation in others.

3.1

Evaluation design

An initial cohort of 15 communities received the program in 2014. Communities assigned to the ﬁrst
cohort were selected by the Mancomunidad and were prioritized after experiencing severe eﬀects of a
drought. An additional 50 communities in relatively aﬄuent coﬀee-producing areas were assigned by
the Mancomunidad to the program’s last cohort. The remaining 68 communities were grouped into
clusters large enough to support a farmer ﬁeld school and randomly assigned to cohort two, three,
or four by the research team. Under the evaluation plan agreed to with the Mancomunidad, program
technicians would ﬁnish distributing chickens raised by the program in one cohort before moving on
to another. This aspect of the plan was not followed to the letter, as can be seen in ﬁgure 2, because the
Mancomunidad did not want delays in earlier cohorts to aﬀect transfers to later cohorts. In addition,
the evaluation plan did not set rules on the distribution of chickens between participating households
(i.e., through pass-on-the-gift) or on the order and pace of distribution within a given cohort.
The randomization was carried out at the cluster level as follows. At the request of the Mancomunidad, three clusters (totaling ﬁve communities) were randomly assigned to cohort three so that

8

the Mancomunidad could adhere closely to the schedule agreed upon with donors. The remaining 48
clusters (with 63 communities) were matched into strata of three clusters each using Euclidean distance as a function of population size, number of communities, altitude (indicators for low, medium,
and high), and indicators for being located in one of three watersheds. Community-level data were
provided by the Mancomunidad. Each member of a stratum was randomly assigned to program cohort two, three, or four. Cohort four would serve as the control group for the evaluation, with followup data being collected before cohort four could plausibly be aﬀected by the program. Communities
were not told in advance when exactly they could expect the program to arrive, which should limit
bias from anticipatory eﬀects.
There was a budget constraint on the evaluation that limited the number of surveys to be collected, ruling out a midline survey and forcing the research team to decide how to distribute the
survey budget between cohorts two, three, and four. The research team assumed that if data were
collected before cohort four was aﬀected by the program, then cohort three would only be weakly affected at that point, particularly as compared to cohort two. Therefore survey data were only collected
from the 16 strata of clusters assigned to cohorts two and four, including 16 clusters/19 communities
assigned to cohort two (i.e., the treatment group) and 16 clusters/22 communities assigned to cohort
four (the control group). Approximate locations of communities included in the data set are shown in
ﬁgure 1. Some communities were dropped from the sample used in estimation for reasons described
in the next section.

3.2

Data collection and sample construction

The sample of interviewed households was constructed in three stages. First, since a census was not
available or feasible given budget constraints when baseline data were collected, supervisors from the
data collection team met with local leaders and created rosters of individuals living in each of the 41
communities assigned to program cohorts two and four. The ﬁeld team made it as clear as possible to
community leaders that no beneﬁt would be gained from appearing on the list and that the purpose

of the list was to gather information that would help the Mancomunidad serve the community. Next,
a random sample of households was selected from each cluster. Finally, households remained in the
sample if they reported participating in at least one productive agricultural activity (raising animals or
planting crops). Households not satisfying these critera were replaced in the sample. The purpose of
ﬁltering households by participation in agriculture was to identify households with a high probability
of future participation in a farmer ﬁeld school.
Figure 2 shows the timing of baseline and endline data collection as well as the cumulative number of chicken set deliveries to households in our data set. Chicken set distribution to households in
the treatment group began in August 2014, leveled oﬀ sharply in March 2016, and continued at a slow
pace into 2018. Transfers to the treatment group after late 2016 are the result of households in the

10

treatment group attending farmer ﬁeld schools outside their communities. The jump in chicken set
distribution in the control group visible in April and May 2017 indicates the start of program rollout
in control communities, while prior chicken set deliveries to control areas are from lack of compliance with treatment assignment (e.g., households in the control group attending farmer ﬁeld schools
in neighboring communities). The approximate 80-day lag between delivery and the start of egg production ensures that none of the chickens transferred to control group households between April
2017 and the start of follow-up data collection in May 2017 would have begun producing eggs. We
discuss the timing of data collection and implications for our analysis in appendix A.2.
As mentioned in the introduction and noted in ﬁgure 2, the program chicken-breeding facility
suﬀered an outbreak of Marek’s disease, which is contagious and deadly to chickens. We discuss the
causes and consequences of the outbreak as well as other program challenges in appendix A.1. A
vaccine against Marek’s disease was introduced into the program in August 2015. Although we do not
have data on chicken deaths, the outbreak could have aﬀected the 42% of program participants in the
treatment group who received their chickens before the vaccine was introduced. 82% of households
who received vaccinated chickens reported that their birds produced eggs versus 32% of households
who received their chickens before the vaccine was introduced. When discussing our results later in
the paper, we consider the role of the disease outbreak in limiting program impacts.

Enumerators completed follow-up interviews with 92.3% of the baseline sample. We restrict
our analysis to households interviewed in both survey rounds and show that our results are robust
to attrition in appendix A.11. Prior to analysis, we dropped two contaminated strata (with a total of
four communities) where the Mancomunidad mistakenly intervened in the control clusters but not
in the clusters assigned to treatment. Assignment to the treatment group was randomized within the
remaining strata, so our identiﬁcation strategy is unaﬀected by dropping the contaminated observations.2 Our ﬁnal sample includes 14 strata, 28 clusters, 36 communities, and 791 households, among
which 14 clusters and 18 communities with 391 households were assigned to treatment and 14 clusters
and 18 communities with 400 households were assigned to control. Power calculations are shown in
section A.7 of the appendix.

3.3

Baseline summary statistics and balance

Table 1 shows averages and standard deviations by treatment status as well as estimated diﬀerences
in means for key demographic indicators and household-level outcomes, all estimated using baseline data. Although baseline chicken ownership is fairly high, egg production is quite low and heavily
skewed, as the median level of egg production among chicken owners is zero over the six months preceding baseline interviews. Egg consumption also looks somewhat high, but the average of roughly
1.35 eggs consumed daily per adult male equivalent is misleading, as the median is 0.65 and 31% of
households reported consuming zero eggs. In general, diﬀerences in means are small relative to the
spread of the data, with calorie consumption and number of naked-neck chickens showing statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The imbalance in naked-neck chickens is the result of outliers in the
control group that are not completely addressed through winsorization. We control for lagged outcomes when estimating program impacts and show robustness to controlling for imbalanced baseline
outcomes in appendices A.16 and A.17.
2 In

appendix A.8 we compare baseline characteristics for our main estimating sample and the contaminated strata
that were dropped, and in general they look very similar. In addition, we present results using the full sample in appendix
A.18, and show our conclusions are unaﬀected.

Continuous outcomes were top coded their 1st and 99th percentiles. Wealth includes the value of land,
livestock, agricultural implements, housing, consumer durables, and savings. All variables in logs were
created using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. Food quantity data were collected using a
consumption module similar to that of the Guatemalan National Survey of Living Standards, modiﬁed for the study context. Calorie and protein data were obtained using a food composition table for
Central America (INCAP, 2012). The food consumption score is a quality-weighted measure of dietary
diversity (World Food Program, 2008).

Table 2 shows baseline summary statistics and balance for age and anthropometric indicators
among girls and boys, respectively, between the ages of six to 60 months at baseline. By focusing on the
ages of six to 60 months, we ensure a high degree of overlap between the timing of chicken transfers
and the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life (from conception until the second birthday), a critical period for child
nutrition and corresponding eﬀects on health outcomes, particularly height (Shrimpton et al., 2001;
Victora et al., 2010). As discussed in appendix A.3, we estimate the overlap between each child’s ﬁrst
1,000 days and the productive life of chickens received by their households. Estimated median overlap
between the productive life of program chickens and the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life among the 115 children
in treatment group households receiving chicken sets before follow-up is 449 days.3 Note that there
are 212 treatment group children at follow-up. In the control group, there are only 29 children who
were in their ﬁrst 1,000 days of life when chickens were delivered and received their chickens before
follow-up.4
Our anthropometric indicators include weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores as well as
indicators for not being underweight, severely underweight, stunted, or severely stunted, all calculated according to guidelines from the World Health Organization (2011). Impacts on Z-scores would
indicate that the program shifted the distribution of height or weight relative to a healthy population,
while changes in indicators for stunting and underweight would imply that children with the poorest
health status were aﬀected by the program.

3 When

estimating the overlap between the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life and the productive life of program chickens, we
assume that the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life start 280 days before the date of birth and end 720 days after birth. We also assume
that egg production starts no earlier than 80 days after chicken set delivery and that program chickens have a productive
life of two years, as per the estimates given to the research team by the Mancomunidad. Finally, we assume that children
whose households stated that their program chickens did not lay eggs had no exposure to productive program chickens.
4 The ratio of boys to girls between the ages of six and 60 months in our sample is 1.29 at baseline and 1.24 at follow-up.
In Guatemala, the sex ratio at birth is 1.05 (Central Intelligence Agency, 2016). When considering all ages, the sex ratio
is almost exactly 1:1. Protocols for obtaining anthropometric data were identical for boys and girls. Field supervisors
reported no greater diﬃculty in obtaining data for girls relative to boys. Whether the larger number of boys in the sample
arose purely by chance or reﬂects a demographic quirk of the program area is unclear.

Empirical approach

We estimate average eﬀects of assignment to the treatment group rather than the control group, i.e.,
intent-to-treat eﬀects. We opt not to estimate eﬀects of the treatment itself. Imperfect compliance
with assigned treatments implies that randomization only identiﬁes the eﬀects of program participation in the absence of spillovers as well as other assumptions laid out in Imbens and Angrist (1994).
For households in our data set, average distance to the nearest neighbor is 74 meters. Ruling out any
exchange of eggs (for example) within communities seems like an excessively strong assumption.

4.1

Estimation and inference for average intent-to-treat eﬀects

Household-level intent-to-treat eﬀects are estimated using the following regression:

𝑦ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛾 𝑠 + 𝜌𝑦ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 + 𝜀ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡

(1)

where ℎ, 𝑐, 𝑠, and 𝑡 index household, cluster, stratum, and time period, respectively. The 𝛾 𝑠 parameter
is a stratum ﬁxed eﬀect, 𝑦ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 is the lagged outcome, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 is a dummy variable equal to one for
households in clusters assigned to the treatment group, and 𝛿 is the average intent-to-treat eﬀect.5
We use a slightly diﬀerent speciﬁcation when estimating impacts on height and weight indicators
among children because lagged outcomes are only observed for individuals who were alive at baseline.
We compensate by using lagged outcomes among siblings, when available:

𝑦𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛾 𝑠 + 𝛾 𝑦𝑖 + 𝛾 𝑦¯ + 𝜌1 𝑦𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 + 𝜌2 𝑦¯ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 + 𝛽 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡 + 𝛿𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 + 𝜀 𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡

(2)

where 𝑖 indexes child, 𝑦𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 is the lagged outcome (set to zero for individuals not yet born at baseline), 𝑦¯ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 is the average lagged outcome among siblings of the same gender as child 𝑖 (e.g., the
lagged average height-for-weight Z-score among girl siblings if child 𝑖 is a girl, set to zero if no such
5 We

used lagged food expenditure for 𝑦𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 when estimating impacts on total expenditure because the latter was
only measured at follow-up.

16

siblings exist), 𝛾 𝑦𝑖 is the coeﬃcient on a dummy variable equal to one if 𝑦𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 is observed, 𝛾 𝑦¯ is the
coeﬃcient on a dummy variable equal to one if 𝑦¯ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 is observed in the data, and 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡 is age in
months as measured at follow-up.
Since individual-level diet indicators were not collected at baseline, we remove 𝛾 𝑦𝑖 , 𝛾 𝑦¯ , 𝑦𝑖ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 ,
and 𝑦¯ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 from the model when estimating impacts on dietary diversity and consumption of animal
source foods among children and replace them with the lagged outcome measured at the household
level using seven-day recall. For inference, we estimate cluster-robust standard errors and eﬀective
degrees of freedom as in Young (2016), which should result in valid inference despite having just 28
clusters in the data. We adjust for multiple comparisons by reporting q-values and 95% conﬁdence
intervals adjusted for the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini and Yekutieli,
2005). We describe our rules for multiple hypothesis testing in detail in appendix A.6.

4.2

Estimation and inference for heterogeneous intent-to-treat eﬀects

We use a procedure described in Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) to explore program impact heterogeneity beyond gender-speciﬁc eﬀects on children. The method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) allows us
to model heterogeneous treatment eﬀects as a function of a large number of observed characteristics
while avoiding “overﬁtting”, i.e., without obtaining an excellent in-sample ﬁt at the expense of highlyvariable out-of-sample performance. Overﬁtting could lead to mistakenly detecting treatment eﬀect
heterogeneity that is a quirk of a given sample rather than reﬂective of the population of interest.
In addition, when applying the method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) we can predict heterogeneous
treatment eﬀects using machine learning methods without placing any distributional assumptions
on the estimates generated by a given algorithm. In general, the theory needed to justify hypothesis
testing using machine learning estimates is not well developed, although there are exceptions (Athey,
Tibshirani, and Wager, 2019; Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2014). In contrast, hypothesis testing is carried out just as in any application of linear regression when applying the method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b). We present key details of our approach to estimating impact heterogeneity

17

below and reserve a detailed discussion for appendix A.4.
To apply the method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b), we begin by estimating the following equation:

¯ + 𝜀 𝑖𝑐𝑠
𝑦𝑖𝑐𝑠 = 𝜶0 𝑿𝑖𝑐𝑠 + 𝛽1 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )) + 𝛽2 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ))(𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) − 𝑆)

(3)

The vector 𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 includes covariates that could explain impact heterogeneity and are observed at baseline or otherwise unaﬀected by assignment to treatment. In appendix A.5 we describe and justify
each variable included in 𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 . The propensity score is given by 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and is set to 0.5 for all observations by virtue of randomization,6 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) is a “proxy predictor” for the conditional intent-to-treat
eﬀect obtained through machine learning methods, and 𝑆¯ is the mean of the proxy predictor. The
¯ is a linear approximation
average intent-to-treat eﬀect is given by 𝛽1 , while 𝛽1 + 𝛽2 (𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) − 𝑆)
to the intent-to-treat eﬀect conditional on 𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 . The properties of ordinary least squares ensure that
¯ is the “best linear predictor” of the conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect given 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ),
𝛽1 + 𝛽2 (𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) − 𝑆)
i.e., the linear predictor that yields the smallest mean squared error (Chernozhukov et al., 2018b). The
vector 𝑿𝑖𝑐𝑠 contains a column of ones and additional terms meant to improve precision, including
stratum indicators, 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), and a proxy predictor for the conditional mean of 𝑦𝑖𝑐𝑠 when assigned to
the control group.
We also estimate equation 4:
𝑦𝑖𝑐𝑠 = 𝜶0 𝑿𝑖𝑐𝑠 + 𝛾 1 𝐺1 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )) + 𝛾 2 𝐺2 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ))

(4)

+ 𝛾 3 𝐺3 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )) + 𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑠
where 𝐺1 is an indicator variable equal to one for observations in the lowest tercile of 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), and 𝐺2
and 𝐺3 are indicators for the middle and top terciles of 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), respectively. If 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) approximates
the true conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect accurately, then 𝛾 1 , 𝛾 2 , and 𝛾 3 will closely correspond to the
6 In our application, subtracting the propensity score from the treatment indicator has no eﬀect on our results since the

propensity score does not vary. However, for research designs where the probability of treatment depends on observed
characteristics, failing to diﬀerence out the propensity score can result in substantial bias (Chernozhukov et al., 2018a).

18

average intent-to-treat eﬀects among households or children least aﬀected, moderately aﬀected, and
most aﬀected by the program. We refer to 𝛾1 , 𝛾 2 , and 𝛾 3 as group average intent-to-treat eﬀects.
Finally, we have:
𝑘
𝑍 𝑖𝑐𝑠
= 𝛿1 𝐺1 + 𝛿 2 𝐺2 + 𝛿3 𝐺3 + 𝑒𝑖𝑐𝑠

(5)

𝑘 represents a single covariate from 𝒁 . The parameters 𝛿 , 𝛿 , and 𝛿 are the means of
where 𝑍 𝑖𝑐𝑠

𝑘 for the least, middle, and most aﬀected observations. By testing whether 𝛿 = 𝛿 we can check
𝑍 𝑖𝑐𝑠

3

whether the most and least aﬀected observations diﬀer in their characteristics. We refer to the comparison of 𝛿 1 and 𝛿3 as classiﬁcation analysis, following Chernozhukov et al. (2018b). We limit the
classiﬁcation analysis presented in the main text to outcomes that exhibit evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity, i.e., where we can reject 𝛽2 = 0 or 𝛾 1 = 𝛾 3 after adjusting for multiple hypothesis
testing.
The method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) avoids overﬁtting by using repeated sample splitting,
i.e., randomly dividing the sample into an auxiliary part used for model selection and a main part used
for estimation and hypothesis testing. We repeat the sample splitting procedure 199 times and report
the median of each point estimate, p-value, and upper and lower conﬁdence interval bound in our
ﬁnal results. Using medians generated by many sample splits increases robustness by avoiding “cherry
picking” a favorable sample split. The cost of sample splitting is that a nominal signiﬁcance level of 𝛼
translates to a true signiﬁcance level of 2𝛼 (Chernozhukov et al., 2018b).
We use two machine learning methods to create the proxy predictors (i.e., 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )): the elastic
net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) and the random forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001). The elastic net is a penalized least squares method that arguably combines the best features of two other methods: LASSO
and ridge regression. When predictors are not highly correlated with one another and the correct
regression model has a relatively small number of non-zero parameters, then , just as in the LASSO.
When a subset of predictors are highly correlated with one another, the elastic net will include them
all in the ﬁnal model, just as in ridge regression (Zou and Hastie, 2005). The random forest algorithm
is an “ensemble” method that averages predictions generated by many “regression trees”. Regression

19

trees are grown by splitting the sample into “leaves” where observations in a leaf have similar values
of covariates that are important for predicting the outcome. Each observation is assigned the average
of the outcome within its leaf as its predicted value. The elastic net should provide a better ﬁt for
outcomes where the conditional mean is approximately linear in parameters whereas random forest
may have more success for nonlinear conditional means. Both methods strong predictive accuracy
while avoiding overﬁtting.
Since we are using two machine learning methods, we could potentially have two tests for every
hypothesis of interest that should be accounted for when adjusting for multiple comparisons. We opt
to present results from only one machine learning method per outcome. When deciding which set
of results to select for a given outcome, we ﬁrst check whether one of the machine learning methods
strictly dominates based on two separate goodness-of-ﬁt measures taken from Chernozhukov et al.
(2018b) and described in appendix A.4. If the two goodness-of-ﬁt measures disagree, then we select
the set of results to report at random.
Note that we do not conduct separate heterogeneity analyses for boys and girls. Dividing the
subsample of children by gender would cut the data too ﬁnely, limiting our ability to detect meaningful eﬀect heterogeneity. Instead, we include gender as one of the characteristics that could shape
treatment eﬀect heterogeneity and estimate average intent-to-treat eﬀects for boys and girls with
machine learning as a check on our main results in section A.13 of the appendix. The results in the
appendix are very similar to what we present in the main text, but estimated less precisely.

Results

5.1

Average intent-to-treat eﬀects on households

Table 3 presents average intent-to-treat eﬀect estimates for household-level outcomes. Virtually all
intent-to-treat estimates are small and imprecisely estimated. Although the negative point estimates
on number of chickens owned and naked-neck chickens owned are somewhat concerning, they are
20

not signiﬁcant and contradicted by a large positive eﬀect on egg production. Overall, impacts on
household-level outcomes are not estimated with enough precision to reach conclusions about program eﬀects.

5.2

Average intent-to-treat eﬀects on children

Table 4 shows average intent-to-treat eﬀect estimates among children aged six to 60 months. Among
girls, impacts on weight-for-age, height-for-age, stunting, and severe stunting are large, signiﬁcant,
and robust to adjustment for multiple comparisons. Estimated eﬀects for boys are generally small
and none are statistically signiﬁcant. Impacts on consumption of animal source foods and the dietary
diversity score are imprecisely estimated for both genders. As shown in the rightmost column of table
4, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in intent-to-treat eﬀects by gender for weight-for-age and stunting,
although none of the diﬀerences in intent-to-treat eﬀects by gender remain statistically signiﬁcant
after adjusting for multiple comparisons. In the appendix we check the robustness of our results to
changes in the estimation sample, covariate set, mode of inference, and estimation method. We also
check for spillovers and attrition bias. In all cases our results are unaﬀected.

heterogeneity parameter (i.e., 𝛽2 ) from equation 3. The last three columns show the average intentto-treat eﬀects for the most aﬀected and least aﬀected groups as well as their diﬀerence. At the household level, log grams of animal protein and the food consumption score have statistically signiﬁcant
treatment eﬀect heterogeneity.7 Although the impact on the least aﬀected tercile for the food consumption score suggests a negative average eﬀect, the estimated diﬀerence is consistent with positive
eﬀects equal to a 5% increase relative to the overall sample average after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing (see the 90% conﬁdence interval in the appendix). Still, it is possible that the least
aﬀected tercile experienced negative eﬀects because of the Marek’s disease outbreak. The indicator
for having consumed animal source foods in the past day is the lone outcome exhibiting detectable
treatment eﬀect heterogeneity among children.
The classiﬁcation analysis presented table 6 shows that households with the largest intent-totreat eﬀects on animal protein consumption are at higher altitudes, suggesting they are poorer and
more isolated. But indicators associated with poverty and isolation show no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in means. Households experiencing the largest impacts on the food consumption score are less educated, have less wealth, have adult female members with relatively few group memberships (suggesting that they have low social capital), and consume less animal protein at baseline than the least
aﬀected households.
Table 7 shows estimated diﬀerences in means for the children with the largest and smallest impacts on the probability of consuming animal protein the past day. Children enjoying the largest
impacts on having consumed animal source foods in the past day are from households that are relatively poor, less likely to be connected to an electricity grid, more likely to have given their children

draft of this paper that circulated under a diﬀerent title did not show evidence of treatment eﬀect heterogeneity
for households outcomes. This changed once we ﬁxed a small number of coding errors that aﬀected indicators of diet
and food consumption and applied the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to baseline animal protein and nakedneck chickens owned. The latter two variables are highly skewed, and transforming them to reduce skewness strongly
improved the performance of the elastic net. The elastic net ﬁts a penalized linear regression model and is therefore
sensitive to observations with outlying values of covariates.

and having a dirt ﬂoor, but these additional diﬀerences are sensitive to adjusting for multiple comparisons.

Discussion

6.1

Are our household-level results consistent with an eﬀective program?

Our household-level analysis did not uncover clear evidence of program impacts. But there are several mitigating factors that could explain this result. First, the Marek’s outbreak likely made impacts on chicken ownership short lived for some households. Second, the power analysis in appendix
A.7 shows that minimum detectable eﬀects for most household-level outcomes are somewhat large.
Third, the program was rolled out over the course of a year and eight months in the treatment group
and follow-up data were collected about two and a half years after the start of implementation. As
noted earlier, naked-neck chickens have a productive life of two to three years. We do not know
whether oﬀspring of program chickens produced eggs. But if program chickens are not eventually
replaced, outcomes like the number of chickens owned and egg production might only be temporarily
aﬀected. Most other household-level outcomes also seem likely to be aﬀected temporarily by the program if transferred chickens were not replaced. The potentially transitory nature of household-level
program eﬀects stands in contrast to impacts on stunting (and to a lesser degree underweight), which
can be permanently improved through proper nutrition in early childhood (Choudhury, Headey, and
Masters, 2019), although gains in height from increased animal protein consumption are not guaranteed to persist over time (Iannotti et al., 2020).

6.2

Explaining larger average impacts on girls than boys

Our results from section 5.2 show a clear pattern of larger impacts on girls. A ﬁrst possible explanation
for this pattern is survivor eﬀects. That is, the program could have allowed boys with relatively low
Z-scores to survive until the follow-up survey. Two children who were young enough at baseline to
later be included in our impact analysis did not survive to the follow-up survey, and the program had
no impact on the number of boys or girls under 60 months of age at the household level (see appendix
A.22). Survivor eﬀects therefore seem unlikely to explain our results. A second explanation is that our

29

results reﬂect gender-speciﬁc diﬀerences in anthropometric indicators in the absence of treatment, or
in the treatment group prior to intervention. We examine the ﬁrst possibility by comparing Z-scores
for boys and girls in the control group at follow-up and the second possibility by comparing boys and
girls in the treatment group at baseline. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and t-tests fail to reject the null
of no diﬀerence by gender in all cases, regardless of whether we condition on being stunted when
testing height-for-age or underweight when testing weight-for-age. A third possible explanation is
that girls were more likely to receive chickens within the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life. We show in appendix
table A.2 that this is not the case.
Alternatively, it could be that boys are more likely than girls to suﬀer from intestinal illness,
undermining gains in height and weight through poor absorption of nutrients (Guerrant et al., 2012).
As mentioned earlier, the program itself could increase intestinal illness by worsening exposure to
pathogens in animal waste. We explore whether the program aﬀected intestinal illness among children as well as diﬀerences in intestinal illness by gender in table 8. The ﬁrst and second columns of
table 8 show no evidence that the program had deleterious eﬀects on child intestinal health. But in
the three rightmost columns we see that the incidence and average duration of intestinal illness are
substantially higher among boys, where the latter is calculated using all children, not just those who
were sick.8
If we could identify the mechanism that is driving higher rates of intestinal illness among boys,
then we might be able to propose a complementary intervention that could raise the eﬀectiveness of
future livestock transfer programs. One possible explanation is greater exposure to pathogens among
infant boys through consumption of drinks mixed with unclean water, e.g., infant formula (AnttilaHughes et al., 2018). In our data, boys between the ages of six and 60 months are more than twice as
likely to consume infant formula than girls at follow-up (p< 0.005), but consumption is small overall
(5.8% of boys versus 2.6% of girls). There are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences by gender in the probability of
8 Note that the q-values and conﬁdence intervals shown in table 8 do not incorporate the hypothesis tests for our main

outcomes of interest shown in table 4. We consider the tests in each table to represent diﬀerent families of hypotheses.
The tests in table 4 each give us a separate chance to determine whether the program had a positive eﬀect on children,
whereas the tests in table 8 all relate to potential negative eﬀects of the program.

30

consuming any other drinks that might deliver pathogens.
Another explanation is that girls are favored by households in the distribution of eggs or meat.
Regressing a series of binary indicators for having consumed diﬀerent animal source foods in the
past 24 hours on gender and age in months reveals no pattern of favoritism towards girls or boys.
Diﬀerences could be with respect to quantity, however. But any existing bias in food distribution in
the Guatemalan context seems more likely to favor boys than girls (Frongillo and Begín, 1993). Our
results could also be explained by diﬀerences in breastfeeding patterns. For example, girls might
stop exclusively breastfeeding earlier than boys, and move on to complementary foods. Our data
do not have detailed information on breastfeeding, so we turn to the the 2014-2015 National Survey
of Maternal and Child Health (NSMCH), which includes a random sample of 566 children between
the ages of zero and 60 months from Chiquimula. The NSMCH data show that conditional on age
in months, gender is uncorrelated with current breastfeeding or duration of breastfeeding. Overall,
diﬀerences in breastfeeding and consumption of complementary foods do not seem to provide an
explanation for higher rates of intestinal illness among boys. We do not have the data needed to
consider other channels of pathogen exposure, such as diﬀerences in the play habits of boys and girls.
Finally, several previous studies have evaluated policy changes that increased asset ownership
or control over income among women while aﬀecting girls but not boys, positing improved women’s
bargaining strength as the mechanism driving gender diﬀerences in eﬀects on children (Duﬂo, 2003;
Qian, 2008; Matz and Narciso, 2010; de Carvalho Filho, 2012). Given our imprecise impact estimates
on chicken ownership, we cannot rule out improved bargaining strength through greater asset ownership as a mechanism.

6.3

Heterogeneous impacts on diet among children

Children in the poorest households enjoy the largest impacts on animal source foods consumption at
follow-up, two and a half years after the start of the program. While we might expect higher current
consumption of animal source foods to be accompanied by gains in height or weight, we do not
have strong evidence for heterogeneous impacts on Z-scores, stunting, or underweight. One possible
explanation for the disconnect between impacts on animal source foods and height and weight is that
poorer households have had their chickens long enough to enjoy increased access to animal source
foods, but not long enough for child height and weight to be aﬀected. This situation could occur
if the Mancomunidad opted to treat wealthier clusters ﬁrst, conditional on treatment assignment.
We check this possibility by regressing the chicken set delivery date (speciﬁed as the number of days
between an arbitrary date and the date of the chicken transfer) on baseline household wealth and ﬁnd
no relationship (p=0.566).
Another explanation is that the poorest children face additional constraints that prevent them
from transforming higher animal source foods consumption into anthropometric gains. Oral-fecal
contamination, for example, has been blamed for the failure of nutritional interventions and oral
vaccines in other contexts (Ngure et al., 2014), motivating the incorporation of water, sanitation, and
hygiene components into nutrition interventions (e.g., Tofail et al. (2018)). As shown in table 8, 35%
of children in our data set between the ages of six and 60 months had diarrhea in the 30 days prior
to follow-up interviews, suggesting that oral-fecal contamination is common in the program’s intervention area.
Access to clean water was scarce in the Mancomunidad during the study period, and was likely
a problem for households of all wealth levels. But hygiene appears to be positively correlated with
wealth in our data. Enumerators conﬁrmed the presence of a hand-washing station with soap in
about 50% of households at follow-up.9 Baseline wealth is 41% higher among households with a handwashing station than in households without. The correlation between wealth and hygiene is also

that we did not ask this question at baseline so it was not included in our machine learning analysis.

33

present in the NSMCH data from Chiquimula, where the probability of having a hand washing station
with running water and soap is 32 percentage points lower for households in the lowest wealth quintile
(according to the wealth index included in the NSMCH data set) than households in the second lowest
quintile. In our data set, children who reported having diarrhea in the 30 days prior to follow-up
data collection are from households with 10% less wealth on average than their counterparts who
did not report having diarrhea. Although household wealth could be correlated with a variety of
factors that mediate program impacts, it is plausible that hygiene and sanitation considerations are
partly responsible for the patterns we see in impacts on anthropometrics and consumption of animal
source foods among children.

Conclusion

We evaluated the chicken transfer and training component of a program seeking to build resilience in
rural Guatemala using a cluster-randomized phase-in design. We estimate program average intentto-treat eﬀects by comparing 14 clusters of communities assigned to receive the program in its second
year to 14 clusters assigned to receive the program in year four. At follow-up, 46.6% of households
assigned to treatment had participated in the program long enough to plausibly have experienced
impacts, whereas the same was true of 13.5% of households assigned to the control group.
We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant average intent-to-treat eﬀects on household-level measures
of expenditure, nutrient intake, diet quality, chicken ownership, egg consumption, egg production
and sales, and chicken management. We acknowledge that low power hampers our ability to detect
household-level eﬀects. Furthermore, the slow pace of program rollout and the typical productive
lifespan of a naked-neck chicken may have resulted in household-level impacts dissipating before
follow-up data were collected. Despite no evidence for positive average eﬀects on household outcomes, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant treatment eﬀect heterogeneity for grams of animal protein consumed and
the food consumption score. Poorer and more isolated households appear to have experienced the
largest impacts on these outcomes.
34

In contrast, we ﬁnd clear evidence for large average intent-to-treat eﬀects on weight and height
among girls who were between the ages of six and 60 months at follow-up. Most notably, stunting fell
by 23.5 percentage points (± 19.4) among girls, an improvement of 57% relative to the control group.
We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant average intent-to-treat eﬀects on height or weight among boys.
Diﬀerences in height and weight impacts by gender could be a product of higher rates of intestinal
illness among boys. The program does not appear to have increased the rate or severity of intestinal illness among children, which could have reduced health improvements. Among children, we
ﬁnd evidence of heterogeneous eﬀects on having consumed animal source foods in the past day, and
the poorest households appear to have enjoyed the largest impacts. But we ﬁnd no corresponding
heterogeneity in height or weight impacts by wealth. Descriptive evidence suggests that diﬀerences
in hygiene by wealth could be to blame, as poor hygiene can lead to increased intestinal illness and
reduced absorption of nutrients.
The main policy implication of our results is that livestock transfer programs can have dramatic
impacts on child health even when undermined by shocks like disease outbreaks. But program modiﬁcations might increase the eﬀectiveness of livestock transfers while sustaining impacts over time.
Adding training modules on nutrition, intrahousehold food distribution, animal waste management,
and hygiene could improve program impacts on health outcomes. Larger positive impacts on households could feed back into program sustainability by demonstrating to beneﬁciaries that chickens are
valuable assets. Livestock transfer programs might be able to encourage animal reproduction by offering households explicit incentives for getting program chickens to successfully produce oﬀspring,
and additional incentives if those oﬀspring go on to produce eggs. The additional egg and meat production generated by new chicks may not be suﬃcient incentives by themselves if villages are poorly
integrated into surrounding markets. These additional incentives could be paired with monitoring of
households who may be novice chicken breeders. Disease outbreaks could be mitigated by building
incentives for animal health professionals into program design if beneﬁciaries are unable to pay for
vaccination and other services. Future research could test the eﬃcacy of complementary interventions by building them into randomized trials.

A.1

Implementation challenges

For the program cohort studied in this article, the farmer ﬁeld schools used to train future chicken
recipients as well as the program poultry breeding and health were initially managed by a local agricultural university. The university in question had never before managed anything approaching the
scale of the chicken breeding and health program required for the program, and it struggled to provide an adequate supply of birds in the program’s initial stages. In response, the program expanded
its breeding stock by purchasing birds from non-program areas, sometimes from households, with
inadequate quarantine procedures. All birds were kept at the same facility, creating a situation where
chickens raised without regular veterinary care mixed with the overall population of program chickens. The result was a major outbreak of Marek’s disease, a virus that is both contagious and deadly
to chickens. In personal communications, program technicians indicated that aﬀected chickens died
within two or three weeks of delivery to beneﬁciary households while the outbreak of Marek’s disease was ongoing. Sick chickens received from the program could have aﬀected healthy chickens
already owned by the household. In our sample, 17 total households received more than one chicken
set, and four of these were households that received chickens before and after the Marek’s vaccine
was introduced.
A vaccine against Marek’s was added to the prophylactic plan used by program technicians in
August 2015, stabilizing the population of chickens distributed by the program. But the vaccine program had challenges of its own. Extension agents trained women from the communities to provide vaccination services, but their spouses sometimes would not let newly-trained animal health
providers go from house to house vaccinating chickens in the community. These problems were
eventually addressed by seeking additional outside expert advice from animal health professionals
and revising management of the program. But the spread of the disease could have been limited had
an animal health care team been in place from the beginning of the program.

45

Figure A.1 and table A.1 capture the respective situations of beneﬁciaries receiving chickens before and after the Marek’s vaccine was added to the program. The horizontal axis of ﬁgure A.1 shows
the time horizon over which treatment group households included in the sample used for this paper
received their chickens. The gray bar graph (measured by the vertical axis on the left side of ﬁgure
A.1) shows the cumulative number of chicken set delivered to treatment households in our sample.
The scatter plot (measured by the vertical axis on the right of ﬁgure A.1) graphs the average number of
chickens owned at follow-up by chicken set recipients against the date that chickens were distributed.
There are more points in the graph than there are clusters in the data because a single cluster could
have multiple delivery dates. There is a jump in the average number of chickens owned once the
Marek vaccine is put in place, and the average number of chickens owned is about 48% higher for
households receiving the vaccine (9.633 versus 6.522 chickens owned on average). We note that the
diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant.

Additional diﬀerences are given in table A.1. Households receiving multiple chicken sets are
included in the post-vaccine group if at least one chicken set was received after August 2015. Households receiving the vaccine own 86% more naked-neck chickens on average than other program participants. Indicators for whether chickens received from the program produced eggs or chicks, eggs
produced, and chicken ownership (naked-neck or otherwise) all suggest that the Marek’s outbreak
46

strongly aﬀected program performance. But since the order of chicken transfers was the product of
administrative concerns and variation in ease of implementation across clusters, none of the diﬀerences in means shown in table A.1 are necessarily causal. Most diﬀerences in means have the expected
sign if we expect households receiving chickens before the vaccine to be worse oﬀ. Exceptions include egg production and having sold chickens or eggs, although the latter could reﬂect distress sales
of chickens among non-vaccine households. Overall, we interpret table A.1 as suggesting that disease
management can have a strong eﬀect on the performance of livestock transfer programs, a fact not
emphasized in prior evaluations. At the same time, the lack of any association between timing of
chicken delivery and detectable diﬀerence in consumption, production, or marketing at follow-up
may indicate that improved implementation does not guarantee sustained program impacts.
The Mancomunidad confronted implementation challenges in addition to the Marek’s outbreak. As already mentioned, participation in program components other than poultry training and
transfers was initially quite low. Program technicians also struggled to identify the gender of chicks.
Commercial layer operations use specialized equipment to identify the gender of young birds. But
a lack of uniformity in appearance makes this same equipment ineﬀective for naked-neck chickens.
According to Mancomunidad technicians, the chicken sets delivered to early program participants
sometimes had less than the desired 5:1 ratio of females to males.
As a result of the Marek’s outbreak and other challenges, the program’s cost of producing a nineweek old male chick was over twice the market price in Chiquimula through early 2017 (Padilla, 2017).
The Mancomunidad responded to the above challenges by revising its implementation model for
subsequent program cohorts. First, the Mancomunidad centralized management of the various program components rather than using a scheme where separate teams administered diﬀerent program
features. Second, the Mancomunidad took control over the chicken breeding and health program,
hired its own technicians and started its own breeding facility with assistance from outside organizations. In the wake of these changes, the cost of production per bird fell to around one quarter of
the market price by late 2017.

A.2

Timing of program implementation and follow-up data collection

When deciding at what moment to collect follow-up data, the research team had to take several factors
into consideration. First, the amount of time needed for program impacts to occur will vary across
outcomes. Second, some program impacts can be sustained over time while others might dissipate.
Third, the timing of program implementation was somewhat unpredictable. The implementation
challenges discussed in section A.1 drastically slowed down rollout in treatment clusters. But once
these issues were addressed, the Mancomunidad accelerated the pace of implementation to stay on
schedule with deadlines set by donors, including starting the program in a randomly selected subset
of communities from cohort three (i.e., the randomized cohort not included in the evaluation) while
farmer ﬁeld schools were still being set up in cohort two (the treatment group).10 The expected start
date of the program in cohort four became hard to predict as a result of these changes.
Recall that our household-level outcomes include measures of chicken ownership and management, egg production, expenditure, diet, and nutrient intake, and that we also estimate individuallevel impacts on indicators or height, weight, and diet for children. Chickens received through the
program would need approximately 80 days to begin producing eggs after delivery to a household,
followed by a productive life of two to three years that would hopefully include giving birth to chicks
that go on to lay their own eggs. For the evaluation to ﬁnd impacts on egg production, expenditure
(e.g., through the value of home egg and meat production), diet, and nutrient intake, households would
therefore need to have received their chickens sets 80 days or more prior to follow-up. For impacts on
child health, appropriate timing of follow-up data collection is less clear, but we can turn to the literature for guidance. A six-month randomized trial in Ecuador where infants aged 6-9 months received
one egg per day reduced stunting by 47% and underweight by 74% (Iannotti et al., 2017a,b). When
factoring in the 80 days needed for the start of egg production, the results of Iannotti et al. (2017a,b)
suggest that around 260 days (80 days plus six months) from chicken set delivery to follow-up data
10 Seven

communities from cohort three were brought into the program while the intervention was still underway in
cohort two. The seven communities were randomly selected by the research team at the request of the Mancomunidad
Copan Ch’orti’, who made the change to stay on track to meet donor targets. These additional communities are not
included in the impact evaluation, as the change in the timing of intervention was made after baseline data were collected.

collection would be adequate for detection of impacts on child health. We discuss the duration of
overlap between the productive life of program chickens and critical moments for child nutrition in
appendix A.3 below.
Collecting follow-up data before any control group households had received their chickens
would have been preferred. But we expect minimal bias arising from control group households with
short-term exposure to the program. The possible exceptions to this assumption are impacts on
chicken ownership or using a registry to keep production records. The former would show eﬀects
immediately after receipt of the chicken set, while the latter might be aﬀected even earlier once control group households began to attend their farmer ﬁeld schools. We also cannot rule out anticipatory
eﬀects (as is the case in any randomized phase-in), but communities were not told far in advance about
when to expect the program’s arrival. Since the exact timing of program rollout was often in ﬂux, it
is not clear that the Mancomunidad could have told communities when to expect the program, even
if they had wanted to do so.

A.3

The timing of chicken transfers and the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life

Child nutrition during the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life (from the estimated date of conception to the second birthday) can have strong eﬀects on later health outcomes, including height (Victora et al., 2010;
Shrimpton et al., 2001). Animal source foods can improve diet quality when children begin to incorporate solids into their diets at around six months of age (Headey, Hirvonen, and Hoddinott, 2018;
Adesogan et al., 2020; Balehegn et al., 2019). At younger ages, children may beneﬁt from improved
maternal nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In a survey of the literature, Imdad and
Bhutta (2011) ﬁnd that balanced protein supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of smallfor-gestational-age babies and low birth weight. Five of the eleven studies included in Imdad and
Bhutta’s 2011 meta-analysis use dairy products as diet supplements. Ghosh (2016) surveys the experimental and observational literature on maternal diet and child health outcomes, and the available
evidence shows that animal protein consumption and infant health outcomes are associated. Among

50

the studies cited by Ghosh (2016), Moore et al. (2004) ﬁnd that the proportion of calories coming
from protein during pregnancy is associated with birth weight and placental weight among women
in South Australia after adjusting for several potential confounders, with protein from dairy showing
the strongest association relative to protein from cereals and meat. Borazjani, Angali, and Kulkarni
(2014) (also cited by Ghosh (2016)) ﬁnds that fetal measurements are positively associated with daily
milk consumption in Maharashtra state, India.
The nutrient proﬁle of dairy products diﬀers from that of eggs. But the literature showing positive eﬀects of maternal dairy consumption on child health outcomes tends to cite increased protein
consumption as the mechanism. Low-protein diets suppress the production of insulin-like growth
factor-1, increasing the likelihood of stunting (Ghosh, 2016). Relative to dairy, eggs are a superior
source of protein and micronutrients in many respects, as discussed in Iannotti et al. (2014). Therefore
it at least seems plausible that eggs consumption could have eﬀects similar to that of dairy consumption on child health. A caveat to the above evidence is that it is not drawn from studies on in-home
production of animal source foods. But regardless of study design, the available evidence suggests a
plausible link between maternal consumption of animal protein and child health outcomes.
If we make assumptions about the productive life of naked-neck chickens (i.e., how long they can
lay eggs), we can estimate the number of days that overlap between the productive life of program
chickens and the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life for each child in our data set. The Mancomunidad Copan
Ch’orti’ estimates that the productive life of a naked-neck chicken will last two to three years. We
use an estimate of two years while assuming zero egg production for households who stated that
their program chickens never laid eggs. We also assume that the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life begin 280 days
before birth and end 720 days afterwards. When estimating overlap between the ﬁrst 1,000 days of
life and access to program chickens, we add 80 days to the chicken delivery date to account for the
delay before the start of egg production.
There are 212 children in the treatment group between the ages of six and 60 months at followup. 115 treatment group children are from households that received their chickens before the follow-

51

up survey. 54 of these same children were still in their ﬁrst 1,000 of life while their program chickens
were of productive age, and their households reported that their program chickens laid eggs. In other
words, 47% of treatment group children in chicken recipient households had productive program
chickens in their ﬁrst 1,000 days of life, as well as 25% of children in treatment group households
overall. The median age 80 days after delivery for children with chickens during their ﬁrst 1,000 days
is 447, with a median overlap of 449 days between the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life and the productive life of
their naked-neck chickens.
There are 61 treatment group children aged six to 60 months at follow-up who did not have
productive program chickens during their ﬁrst 1,000 days of life, despite their households receiving
chicken sets before follow-up. Among these households, only ten reported that their program chickens laid eggs. Most children in this group are older and more likely to be in households receiving
chickens early in the program, before the Marek’s vaccine was being administered.
In contrast to the treatment group, only 14 children in the control group had received program
chickens within their ﬁrst 1,000 days of life at follow-up and were in households reporting that the
chickens received laid eggs. The distribution of age at the date of chicken delivery for the treatment
group is shown in ﬁgure A.2.
In table A.2 we report estimated intent-to-treat eﬀects for the eﬀect of assignment to treatment
on overlap between the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life and the productive life of program chickens. We also
present local average treatment eﬀects estimated by two-stage least squares where we deﬁne being
treated as having program chickens for at least six months at follow-up, just as we do in appendix A.19
when estimating local average treatment eﬀects on all outcomes. Under th assumptions described in
Imbens and Angrist (1994), the local average treatment eﬀect is the average impact of having program
chickens for at least six months before follow-up for the subpopulation of compliers, i.e., households
that would have program chickens for at least six months if assigned to cohort 1 but not otherwise. We
instrument receipt of treatment using the indicator for random assignment to the treatment group.
The results in table A.2 suggest that assignment to treatment strongly aﬀected exposure to program

chickens in the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life for children in our sample.
Given that the median age when chickens were delivered to treatment group households is 447
days, a signiﬁcant portion of the productive life of program chickens could have occurred beyond the
ﬁrst 1,000 days of life for many treatment group children. Increased animal source food production
likely has weaker eﬀects on child health after the second birthday, as most growth faltering occurs
during the ﬁrst 1,000 day window (Victora et al., 2010; Shrimpton et al., 2001). But additional evidence
supports the idea that further growth faltering can occur beyond the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life, although
this does not imply that animal source food consumption can increase height beyond the ﬁrst 1,000
days. Using DHS data from 51 countries, Leroy et al. (2014) ﬁnd that around 30% of the height deﬁcit
relative to a healthy population occurs between the second and ﬁfth birthdays. It is important to
note that Leroy et al. (2014) rely on height-for-age diﬀerences in centimeters relative to health population rather than Z-scores, while showing that Z-scores can mask growth faltering after the second
birthday. More recent analysis of DHS data by Headey et al. (2017) using Z-scores to calculate stunting prevalence suggests that children in Latin America and the Caribbean may be an exception to
54

this rule, with growth faltering are especially likely experience continued growth faltering beyond 24
months of age.11
Regardless, we expect that the strongest eﬀects on height will be felt by children receiving chickens during the ﬁrst 1,000 days of life. In our sample, no one older than 54 months of age received
chickens during their ﬁrst 1,000 days of life. If we were to ﬁnd that our results are not robust to excluding children older than 54 months, we might be concerned that a mechanism other than program
chickens is driving impacts, or that our results are spurious. In table A.3, we show results obtained by
re-estimating our main regression model after dropping children older than 54 months of age. Precision drops slightly because of the decrease in sample size, but none of our conclusions are aﬀected.

11 See ﬁgure S1 in the supplementary appendix to Headey et al. (2017), which shows that predicted stunting prevalence
continues to increase in Latin America beyond 24 months age.

We oﬀer one last piece of evidence for chicken transfers as the mechanism driving program impacts. Recall that each stratum in our data set includes one cluster from the treatment group and one
from control, and that each cluster consists of no more than two neighboring communities. Stratumlevel variation in chicken delivery timing is observed for all households and may capture spillover
eﬀects within the treatment group from chicken deliveries to neighboring communities, unlike the
household-level chicken delivery date. Stratum-level variation in chicken deliveries is also unaﬀected
by treatment status, whereas the chicken delivery date is, making the latter inappropriate for a model
of heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. Estimates of the variation in treatment eﬀects explained by differences in delivery timing across strata should also not be aﬀected by spillovers bias, because clusters
were not matched into strata on the basis of geographic proximity. We re-estimate our main equation
for the subsample of children in strata where the ﬁrst delivery of chickens occurred during the ﬁrst
1,000 days of life, adding 80 days to the chicken delivery date to adjust for the lag before egg production (60% of girls and 59% boys fall within this subsample). The median treatment group child in
this subsample was slightly over 8 months old when her strata received its ﬁrst chicken transfer. We
repeat this estimation step for remaining children and test the null hypothesis of equal intent-to-treat
eﬀects in the two subsamples.
The resulting intent-to-treat eﬀects and the 90% conﬁdence intervals for their diﬀerences are
shown in ﬁgure A.3. Diﬀerences in intent-to-treatment eﬀects for weight-for-age, underweight, and
stunting among girls are positive and signiﬁcant at the 10% level. Among boys, all diﬀerences in intentto-treat eﬀects are imprecisely estimated. While none of the estimated diﬀerences in intent-to-treat
eﬀects remain signiﬁcant after adjusting for multiple comparisons, we interpret ﬁgure ﬁgure A.3 as
supporting the hypothesis that chicken transfers drove program eﬀects on girls.

Explanation of machine learning methods

As discussed in the main text, we estimate heterogeneous intent-to-treat eﬀects using a method created by Chernozhukov et al. (2018b). We implement the method of using the following steps:

Notes: Point estimates were generated by allowing intent-to-treat eﬀects to depend on whether the ﬁrst chickens delivered
to a child’s stratum reached egg-laying age during a child’s ﬁrst 1,000 days of life. Diﬀerences in treatment eﬀects for girls
are signiﬁcant at the 10% level for Weight-for-age, Not underweight, and Not stunted. None of the diﬀerences in treatment
eﬀects are signiﬁcant after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

1. We randomly split our data in half into a main sample (𝑀) and an auxiliary sample (𝐴). We
stratify on cluster when splitting the sample, so that each cluster is evenly split between the
main and auxiliary samples.
2. Let 𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 be a vector of characteristics observed at baseline or otherwise unaﬀected by treatment
for unit (household or child) 𝑖 in cluster 𝑐 from stratum 𝑠. We compute the propensity score,
𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), i.e., the conditional probability of being assigned to treatment, for the program. Since
all households in our initial roster had an equal chance of being assigned to the treatment group,
we set the propensity score to 0.50.
3. Let 𝑠0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) be the conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect, i.e., the average impact of being assigned
58

to treatment for units with characteristics 𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 . Let 𝑏0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) be the conditional mean of the
outcome in the absence of treatment. Using the auxiliary sample, we use ML methods to obtain proxy predictors of 𝑠0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and 𝑏0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ). The proxy predictor for 𝑏0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) is the ﬁtted
value from a ML model of the outcome estimated using units assigned to control, while the
proxy predictor for 𝑠0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) is the ﬁtted value from a ML model of the outcome estimated
using treated units minus the predicted proxy for 𝑏0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ). The proxy predictors for the conditional intent-to-treat and conditional mean of the outcome in the absence of treatment are
given by 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and 𝐵(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), respectively.
4. The results of the previous step are used to generate predicted proxies 𝐵(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) for
the main sample.
5. We next estimate the following regression by OLS using the main sample:

¯ + 𝜀 𝑖𝑐𝑠
𝑦𝑖𝑐𝑠 = 𝛼0 𝑿𝑖𝑐𝑠 + 𝛽1 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )) + 𝛽2 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ))(𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) − 𝑆)

(A.1)

where 𝑿𝑖𝑐𝑠 includes the stratum indicators, 𝐵(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), and 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ). The latter two terms are included to improve model ﬁt. The 𝑆¯ term is the mean of 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and is replaced with the average
of the 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) from the main sample in estimation. Other details of this equation are discussed
in the main text.
6. Observations in the main sample are then sorted by their values of the best linear predictor
¯ Note that this is equivalent to sorting on 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ). After
for 𝑠0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), i.e., (𝛽1 + 𝛽2 (𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) − 𝑆)).
sorting, observations in the main sample are split into terciles with high, middle, and low values
of 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ). If 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) is a high-quality proxy predictor of 𝑠0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), then the terciles of 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )
should closely correspond to units with high, middle, and low impacts of being assigned to
treatment.

59

7. Next we estimate the group average intent-to-treat eﬀects:
𝑦𝑖𝑐𝑠 = 𝛼0 𝑿𝑖𝑐𝑠 + 𝛾 1 𝐺1 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )) + 𝛾 2 𝐺2 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ))

(A.2)

+ 𝛾 3 𝐺3 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 − 𝑝(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 )) + 𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑠
Details of this equation are described in the main text.
8. Next, we estimate the classiﬁcation analysis parameters:

𝑘
𝑍 𝑖𝑐𝑠
= 𝛿 1 𝐺1 + 𝛿2 𝐺2 + 𝛿 3 𝐺3 + 𝑒𝑖𝑐𝑠

(A.3)

Details of this equation are described in the main text.
9. Lastly, we calculate two goodness-of-ﬁt measures for each combination of outcome and ML
method: one measure that maximizes the variation in the outcome explained by equation A.2,
which we will refer to as “Best GITTs”, and a second measure that maximizes the correlation
between 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and 𝑠0 (𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), which we will refer to as “Best best linear predictor”.
Within each split of the data, we estimate standard errors and degrees of freedom as in Young
(2016) for equations A.1 and A.2. We use heteroskedasticity-robust “HC1” standard errors (MacKinnon
and White, 1985) for equation A.3.12 We do not cluster our standard errors when performing inference
on the classiﬁcation analysis parameters because we do not view our sample as being multi-stage
and we do not purposefully assign individuals to 𝐺1 , 𝐺2 , or 𝐺3 in a way that is correlated with cluster membership; Abadie et al. (2017) prove that cluster-based assignment or two-stage sampling are
necessary for clustering in a randomized trial. We do not use an eﬀective degrees of freedom correction or bias-reduced standard errors for the classiﬁcation analysis standard errors because these
adjustments have no eﬀect when the parameter of interest is a simple comparison of means.
12 The

random number generator driving the choice of sample splits as well as all other results in this paper that rely
on random number generation was seeded using the closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a pre-speciﬁed
date (December 20, 2018). Pre-speciﬁcation can be veriﬁed at the Github site of one of the co-authors and will be made
available at the conclusion of the blind review process.

The algorithm described above is repeated for 199 random splits of the data. The ﬁnal estimate
for each object of interest (parameter point estimates, p-values, goodness-of-ﬁt measures, etc.) is
its median from the 199 sample splits as in Chernozhukov et al. (2018b). We base hypothesis testing
on 90% conﬁdence intervals constructed using the median upper and lower bounds from the 95%
conﬁdence intervals estimated in each sample split, and two times the median p-values generated by
the sample splits. We correct for multiple comparisons by reporting q-values and conﬁdence intervals
adjusted for the false discovery rate. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made within families
of hypotheses described in section A.6 of the appendix. Table A.4 presents goodness-of-ﬁt measures
by outcome for our selected machine learning methods.
The method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) has several appealing features. To estimate the parameters of equations 3 through 5, observations are randomly divided in half between an auxiliary
sample and a main sample, where the former is used to build the model for the proxy predictors and
the latter is used in estimating parameters from equations 3, 4, and 5. By using sample splitting, Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) avoid “overﬁtting” even when including many covariates in 𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 . In addition,
we are able to exploit the predictive power of machine learning methods without placing any distributional assumptions on the proxy predictor 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) and without having to assume that 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ) is an
unbiased or consistent estimator of the conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect. This is achieved by estimating the best linear predictor of the conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect and comparing diﬀerences in the
average intent-to-treat eﬀect across terciles formed by sorting on 𝑆(𝒁 𝑖𝑐𝑠 ), rather than attempting to
directly estimate and then sort on the conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect itself. By focusing on the best
linear predictor, we can conduct hypothesis testing for each parameter of interest just as we would
in any other application of linear regression, conditional on how the sample is split into main and
auxiliary parts.
We pair two machine learning methods with the algorithm of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b): the
elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) and the random forest algorithms (Breiman, 2001). The elastic net

where 𝛼 ≤ 1 and 𝑦˜𝑖𝑐𝑠 and 𝒁˜ 𝑖𝑐𝑠 are the outcomes and a set of predictors, respectively, that have been
standardized to have averages of zero and variances of one. For a given random split of the data into
main and auxiliary samples, we choose 𝛼 and 𝜆 by twice-repeated, two-fold cross validation within
the auxiliary sample (i.e., randomly split the data into main and auxiliary samples, reverse the roles of
the samples, and then repeat with another random split), performing a grid search over 100 randomly
62

chosen values of each parameter.
As is clear from equation A.4, the elastic net is a penalized least squares method where the penalty
depends on 𝜆, 𝛼, and two functions of the regression coeﬃcients: the square root of the sum of the
absolute value of the regression coeﬃcients (i.e., the L1 norm, as in the LASSO algorithm) and the
square root of the sum of squared regression coeﬃcients (the L2 norm, as in ridge regression). Penalized least squares methods can outperform ordinary least squares in prediction by avoiding overﬁtting. In eﬀect, penalized methods improve mean-squared prediction error by trading lower variance
for increased bias. The L1 norm constraint used in the LASSO forces many regression coeﬃcient
to zero, resulting in better predictive performance than ridge regression when the true conditional
mean function has relatively few nonzero coeﬃcients. However, when a group of predictors is highly
correlated, the LASSO will tend to include just one predictor from the group, resulting in worse predictive performance than ridge regression. Ridge regression would instead include all predictors in
the group and assign them similar coeﬃcients (recall that all predictors are standardized to be on the
same scale). The elastic net improves on LASSO and ridge regression by selecting a parsimonious
model when predictors are not highly correlated (as in the LASSO) and including all predictors from
highly correlated groups (as in ridge regression) (Zou and Hastie, 2005).
The random forest algorithm is an “ensemble” method that generates predictions by averaging
many estimated “regression trees”. Regression trees do not impose structure on the conditional mean
as in a linear model like the elastic net, and the random forest algorithm will tend to outperform the
elastic net if the conditional mean of the outcome is highly non-linear. A single regression tree is
ﬁt as follows. For a given predictor, the sample is split in two at each possible predictor value, and
each observation is assigned the average value of the outcome within its sample split as its predicted
value. This process is repeated for all predictors, and the sample split that results in the smallest sum
of squared prediction errors is retained. This process is repeated, searching for the sample split that
results in the smallest sum of squared prediction errors conditional on existing sample splits until a
stopping criterion is reached or no more sample splits are possible. This process forms a regression
tree with branches created by sample splits and “leaves” containing groups of observations formed
63

by the sample splits at the end of each branch. Each observation’s predicted value is set equal to the
average within its leaf.
Individual regression trees are highly vulnerable to overﬁtting, and random forests improve
performance in two ways. First, a large number of separate regression trees are ﬁt, and each observation’s prediction is the average prediction across the trees. But each tree is estimated using a separate
bootstrap sample with size equal to two-thirds of the overall sample. For a given observation, the
predicted value is calculated using the regression trees where the observation in question was not
part of the bootstrap sample. Using separate data for estimation and prediction reduced overﬁtting.
Second, each time a new split in a given tree is considered, the algorithm only considers a random
subset of the available predictors. This last feature has the eﬀect of decorrelating predictions across
trees, so that modeling errors in each separate tree tend to cancel out when averaging their predicted
values.
When using the random forest algorithm, we used a minimum leaf size of one grew 1,000 trees.
We choose the number of predictors considered at each sample split by repeated two-fold cross validation. We compared ten diﬀerent randomly-selected values for the number of predictors. The elastic net and the random forest algorithm were implemented in R with the glmnet and randomForest
packages, respectively, while tuning was carried out using the CARET package.
Note that several of our outcomes are binary (e.g., whether a child is not stunted) or count variables (e.g., number of chickens owned). The elastic net can be used as a penalized logistic or Poisson
regression in such cases. For binary outcomes, random forest predictions can assign a predicted class
(i.e., 0 or 1) based on a majority vote of observations in the same node. For example, if a majority of
observations in your node have a value of 1 for the binary outcome, your prediction is set equal to 1.
For the results presented in this article, we used penalized OLS for all outcomes and generated ﬁtted
values from the random forest as the average ﬁtted value within each observation’s node. But we did
check sensitivity to using a penalized logit or Poisson regression where appropriate and taking the
classiﬁcation approach to prediction using the random forest algorithm. There was no noticeable

64

diﬀerence in our goodness of ﬁt measures and our overall results were nearly the same.

A.5

Predictor selection for analysis of heterogeneous treatment eﬀects

We use the characteristics listed below as predictor variables when estimating the predicted proxies
to the true heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. We use the same set of characteristics when describing
diﬀerences between the most and least aﬀected, i.e., in our classiﬁcation analysis:
1. Demographics (household size in AMEs, the dependency ratio, average years of education
among household members ages twelve and older).
2. Geographic and weather information at follow-up (altitude of the dwelling, millimeters of rain
measured during the 2015 maize and bean season at the nearest weather station, number of
days where the maximum temperature recorded at the nearest weather station was over 30°C
during the 2015 maize and bean season).
3. Wealth and credit (the combined value of land, livestock, tools, consumer durables, cash and
grain savings, and the annual rental value of housing; an indicator for whether the dwelling has
a dirt ﬂoor; an indicator for whether the household had a loan from a formal lender).
4. Several lagged household outcomes: log calories, the food consumption score, log grams of
animal protein, log number of chickens owned, log of eggs produced. We dropped food expenditure because it was highly correlated with calories and naked-neck chickens because of
high correlation with total chickens. We exclude lagged indicators for whether the household
kept poultry production records or sold any eggs because they exhibited little variation in the
sample. Note that we approximate the log transformation using the inverse hyperbolic sine
function (Bellemare and Wichman, 2019).
5. Access to services and markets (separate indicators for being connected to a water network,
being connected to an electricity network, time to nearest market, and unit value per egg consumed)
65

6. Group memberships for the household as a whole.
7. Indicators of women’s empowerment (the share of household wealth controlled by women
either jointly or independently and group memberships among adult women.
When modeling variation in impacts on child-level outcomes, we include all of the above characteristics as well as the following:
1. Age in months at follow-up
2. Gender
3. The relevant lagged outcome (speciﬁed as in equation 2 of the main text, including dummy
variables for availability of lagged outcome data)
4. Whether the household participated in the “Mi Bono Seguro” conditional cash transfer program at baseline
5. Whether the household administered a government-supplied micronutrient supplement to its
children at baseline
Finally, we also include stratum dummies and distance to the nearest weather station as measured at follow-up in the predictor set for equations A.1 and A.2, but do not include them in our
classiﬁcation analysis. Distance to the nearest station may control for a portion of the measurement
error associated with using data from the nearest station as a measure of weather conditions on the
farm. The stratum dummies and the additional covariates just described are not included when estimating the classiﬁcation analysis parameters.
Although the elastic net and random forest algorithms remove much of the guesswork from
model selection, we used theory and knowledge of the program to choose the initial pool of predictors
listed above. We include demographics in the set of baseline predictors because knowing whether
program impacts are correlated with information that is easily observed could be useful for targeting.
66

Several variables included in our set of baseline predictors will let us examine whether the largest
program beneﬁts were enjoyed by the most or least aﬄuent households in the study area, including
wealth, having a formal loan, access to services and markets, social capital, and receiving conditional
cash transfers. Better-oﬀ households may experience larger eﬀects if they are able to avoid selling
or eating chickens when suﬀering negative shocks, or smaller eﬀects if the marginal improvement in
diet is greater among relatively poor program participants.
Our weather data cover the 2015-2016 agricultural year and are drawn from six weather stations constructed as part of the program. Alternative weather data sources showed poor correlation
with the station data. Although our data do not allow for credible identiﬁcation of causal weather
eﬀects, examining the correlation of program impacts with weather conditions is interesting because
of the robustness of naked-neck chickens to heat and drought (Chen et al., 2004). For our measure
of exposure to extreme temperatures, we use the total number of days with maximum temperatures
above 30°C. 30°C is a commonly used cutoﬀ when studying the sensitivity of crop yields or livestock
to extreme heat (see Lobell et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2004)). We use maximum rather than average temperatures because there is little variation across stations in the number of days with average
temperatures over 30°C. Higher altitudes will be associated with cooler temperatures, but along with
distance to the closest market and egg units value, may also indicate greater geographic isolation. We
would expect low supply of animal protein at baseline to be more of a concern for relatively isolated
communities.
Women’s standing in the household, as captured by women’s share of wealth and women’s social
capital, could play an important role in shaping impacts. For example, a woman with a strong bargaining position in the household may be able to dissuade her husband from selling or eating chickens received through the program before they begin to reproduce. Clusters assigned to treatment in
which women have relatively high social capital might enjoy large program beneﬁts if more social ties
lead to increased trade or transfer of eggs or chickens from program households to their neighbors.
If women have a greater preference for child welfare than their spouses, then households in which
women have a strong bargaining position might enjoy relatively large impacts on child health and
67

diet, particularly if these same households are constrained in access to animal source foods at baseline. On the other hand, if children in households where women have a relatively strong inﬂuence on
decision making tend to be healthy and eat a diverse diet at baseline, we might instead see the largest
eﬀects in households where women have a low share of assets or poor social capital prior to receiving
their chicken sets.13
Participation in Guatemala’s “Mi Bono Seguro” conditional cash transfer program functions
as a poverty indicator. But cash transfers could indicate that some of the constraints preventing
improved child health are being addressed by other interventions. The same argument could be made
for provision of micronutrients to children. If regular health clinic visits (as stipulated by Mi Bono
Seguro for families with children under six years of age) and micronutrients are needed to convert
greater consumption of animal source foods into height and weight gains, then households answering
aﬃrmatively to each of these indicators might enjoy the largest program impacts. Research elsewhere
in Guatemala suggests that parents can sprinkle micronutrient powder on eggs, making the former
more palatable and potentially increasing supplement intake (Gillespie, 2018).
Note that we drop two household-level outcomes (indicators for maintaining a poultry registry
and having sold eggs in the six months prior to follow-up) and two child-level outcomes (indicators
for not being severely underweight and not being severely stunted) prior to our analysis of heterogeneous eﬀects. Each of these outcomes exhibited little variation in the sample, making it diﬃcult
to split the sample in two while preserving at least some outcome variation in each subsample as required by the method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b). Finally, as noted in the main text, we do not
conduct separate heterogeneity analyses for boys and girls. Results obtained when splitting the sample of children by gender are similar but less precise than what we obtain by pooling the sample of
children.
13 Note that detailed questions on intrahousehold ownership and control over assets and social capital were only asked

at baseline to reduce the length of the follow-up survey. Therefore we do not include indicators of social capital or
women’s relative standing in the household in our set of outcomes.

A.6

Adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing: the false discovery rate

Throughout the main text (except for our balance test tables) we report q-values, i.e., the estimated
false discovery rate, alongside p-values for each hypothesis of interest. If a hypothesis test yields a
p-value of 0.05 and a q-value of 0.10, this implies that rejecting all null hypotheses with p-values of
0.05 or less would result in 10% of rejected nulls being true in expectation. The q-values are calculated
as follows (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995):

𝑞 = 𝑀𝑝𝑚 /𝑚

(A.5)

where 𝑝𝑚 is the 𝑚th smallest p-value when all p-values are ordered from smallest (i.e., 𝑚 = 1) to largest
(i.e., 𝑚 = 𝑀) and 𝑀 is the number of tests being performed in the relevant “family of hypotheses”.
We deﬁne each family of hypotheses as including all tests that give us a chance to answer the same
question (Lakens, 2016). For example, in table A.1, each of the ten tests in the “Diﬀerence” column
gives us a chance to say whether households receiving their chickens before the Marek vaccine was
put in place and households receiving their chickens afterwards diﬀer in their average characteristics.
To compute the q-values reported in table A.1, we therefore used equation A.5 with 𝑀 = 10 and
𝑚 ∈ [1, . . . , 10].
We also report 95% conﬁdence intervals adjusted for the false discovery rate in parentheses below
the unadjusted 95% conﬁdence intervals shown in square brackets. The adjusted intervals ensure that
95% of intervals for tests in a family of hypotheses cover their true parameter values in repeated
samples. In contrast, each of the unadjusted 95% conﬁdence intervals shown in parentheses is meant
to ensure a 95% coverage rate for a single parameter (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005). To compute the
intervals adjusted for the false discovery rate, we increase the critical values of the t-statistics used to
compute the unadjusted intervals. The 95% conﬁdence interval adjusted to control the false discovery
rate uses the [1 − (𝛼𝑚/2𝑀)] th percentile of the same t-distribution, where 𝑚 and 𝑀 are deﬁned as
in equation A.5 (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005).
At the household level, tests of the null hypothesis that the average intent-to-treat eﬀect is equal
69

to zero are grouped into three families:
1. Expenditure impacts (includes tests of impacts on expenditure and food expenditure per adult
male equivalent)
2. Household diet impacts (daily calories per adult male equivalent, daily grams of animal source
foods protein per adult male equivalent, daily servings of eggs for the houseold, daily eggs
consumed per adult male equivalent, and the food consumption score)
3. Impacts on poultry outcomes (chickens owned, naked-neck chickens owned, using a poultry
registry, eggs produced in the last six months, and having sold an egg in the last six months)
For children, we divide outcomes into health impacts (weight and height indicators) and diet impacts
(animal source foods consumption indicator, individual dietary diversity score). Tests of the null of a
zero average intent-to-treat eﬀect are then split into six families: health and diet impacts among girls,
health and diet impacts among boys, and diﬀerences in health and diet impacts by gender.
When estimating heterogeneous intent-to-treat eﬀects, we seek to answer the following questions:
1. Which outcomes exhibit heterogeneity in the conditional intent-to-treat eﬀect?
2. For the outcomes where we have evidence of impact heterogeneity, are there any diﬀerences
in the average characteristics of the most and least aﬀected households or children?
For a given outcome, we conclude that there is treatment eﬀect heterogeneity if we can reject
𝛽2 = 0 (from equation A.1) or 𝛾1 = 𝛾 3 (from equation A.2) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. In
adjusting for multiple comparisons, we divide outcomes just as described above. For each outcome,
we have separate tests of whether 𝛽2 = 0 and whether 𝛾 1 = 𝛾 3 . Therefore we have four hypothesis
tests in the family. The adjusted 90% conﬁdence intervals and q-values are obtained by applying the
formula given in equation A.5 to the four corresponding unadjusted 90% conﬁdence intervals and
p-values, respectively.
70

If our tests of 𝛽2 = 0 and 𝛾 1 = 𝛾 3 lead us to conclude that a particular outcome variable exhibits
impact heterogeneity, then we report classiﬁcation analysis results for that outcome in the main text.
That is, we present a set of equality of means tests to determine whether the units that were most and
least aﬀected by the program exhibit diﬀerences in characteristics. The question being asked by the
classiﬁcation analysis tests is outcome speciﬁc. For example, do the children who enjoyed the largest
and smallest impacts with respect to animal source foods consumption diﬀer in their characteristics?
Therefore we adjust for multiple comparisons within each outcome when reporting our classiﬁcation
analysis results.
For the sake of completeness, we report our estimates of 𝛽1 (the average intent-to-treat obtained
from equation A.1) as well as 𝛾 1 and 𝛾 3 from equation A.2, although these parameters do not factor into
our decision rules. For each parameter we adjust for multiple comparisons within the families described above. In addition, any classiﬁcation analysis and group average intent-to-treat eﬀects results
not shown in the main text are reported in sections A.15 and ?? of this appendix.

A.7

Power calculations

In this section we estimate minimum detectable eﬀects for the impact of being assigned to the treatment group (i.e., the intent-to-treat eﬀect). The minimum detectable eﬀect (MDE) is the smallest
program eﬀect size that, if true, would allow us to reject the hypothesis of a zero eﬀect in 80% of
the samples that we could draw from our population of interest. The smaller the MDE for a given
outcome, the more likely we are to correctly conclude that the program had a non-zero eﬀect on that
outcome.
Let 𝛿 𝑀𝐷𝐸 represent the minimum detectable eﬀect. Let 𝑠𝑒𝛿ˆ be the standard error for the causal
eﬀect of interest (i.e., intent-to-treat or local average treatment eﬀect). The minimum detectable eﬀect
is given by:
𝛿 𝑀𝐷𝐸 = (𝑡𝛼/2 + 𝑡1−𝛽 )𝑠𝑒𝛿ˆ

The parameters 𝛼 and 𝛽 represent the probability of making a Type 1 error (rejecting a false null

respectively. We set 𝛼 to 0.05 and 𝛽 to 0.80 for all estimated minimum detectable eﬀects. We present
all minimum detectable eﬀects in each outcome’s original units, in standard deviations of the control
groups’s observed distribution at follow-up, and as a perecent of the average in the control group

When estimating the minimum detectable intent-to-treat eﬀect for a given outcome, we use the
standard error from equation 1 for household-level outcomes and equation 2 for child-level outcomes.
We use eﬀective degrees of freedom calculated as in Young (2016) to obtain the critical values (from a

to a 88% increase, which seems large but is less dramatic when one considers that control group
households owned 2.425 naked-neck chickens on average at follow-up, while the baseline sample average was about 1.3 naked-neck chickens owned. The minimum detectable eﬀect for using a poultry
registry also appears reasonable, at 4.8 percentage points. Other household-level outcomes are underpowered. When looking at child outcomes, minimum detectable eﬀects for the intent-to-treat eﬀect
look reasonable as long as positive spillovers are likely.

Comparison of estimation sample and dropped strata

In tables A.8 through A.10 we present diﬀerences in baseline characteristics between our main sample
and the strata that were dropped because of control group contamination. There are no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the two groups.

Randomization inference

In tables A.11, A.12, and A.13 we check the robustness of the estimated average intent-to-treat eﬀects
to mode of inference. Speciﬁcally, we compare inference based on analytic p-values and q-values to
what we obtain through randomization inference (RI).
Let 𝛽ˆ0 be the intent-to-treat eﬀect estimated using the observed vector of treatment assignments.
We use the same estimating equation used in the main text. Let 𝛽ˆ𝑏 be the intent-to-treat estimate
obtained when applying alternative-stratiﬁed randomization 𝑏 to the data set. The RI p-value for a
two-tailed test is given by:
𝐵
1 ∑︁ ˆ
(
𝐼 (| 𝛽𝑏 | ≥ | 𝛽ˆ0 |))

where 𝐼 (·) is an indicator function equal to one if the condition in parentheses is true and zero otherwise, and 𝐵 is the number of permutations. We set 𝐵 = 999. We compute RI q-values by applying
equation A.5 the RI p-values.

that p-values and q-values obtained through permuting treatment assignments are larger than what
we obtained using analytic standard errors. None of our conclusions regarding impacts on girls or

Bias from spillovers across communities

Communities in the program’s intervention area are poorly connected by infrastructure and mostly
located in rugged terrain. Therefore spillovers across communities are unlikely, but we formally test
for them below. To estimate spillovers for household-level outcomes, we exploit random variation
in the density of households assigned to treatment and estimate the following equation:

𝑇
𝑇
𝑦ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛾 𝑠 + 𝜌𝑦ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 + 𝛽1 𝑃𝑑ℎ𝑐𝑠
+ 𝛽2 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑐 × 𝑃𝑑ℎ𝑐𝑠
) + 𝜀ℎ𝑐𝑠𝑡

(A.8)

𝑇 is the proportion of households within distance d of household
where 𝛾 𝑠 is a stratum ﬁxed eﬀect, 𝑃𝑑ℎ𝑐𝑠

i in cluster c from stratum s that was assigned to treatment, 𝛿 is the average intent-to-treat eﬀect in
the absence of externalities, 𝛽1 is the average marginal spillover eﬀect among controls, and 𝛽1 + 𝛽2 is
the average marginal spillover eﬀect among treated households. The estimating equation for spillover
eﬀects on children is similar to equation A.8 but modiﬁed to include lagged outcomes and dummy
variables for availability of lagged outcome data as descrbied in section 4.1 of the main text.
We focus on spillover eﬀects onto the control group since any program eﬀects on the controls
would bias the intent-to-treat estimates presented in the main text. The average spillover eﬀect on
control households is given by:
𝑇

𝛽1 𝑃 𝑑

(A.9)

𝑇

where 𝑃 𝑑 is the proportion of households assigned to treatment within a distance d, averaged over
all control group observations. We estimate the eﬀect given in equation A.9 for distances of one and
two kilometers. Allowing for spillovers over greater distances results in little variation in the density
of treated households.
Table A.15 gives our estimate of equation A.9 for household-level outcomes, while table A.16 does
the same for impacts on children. At the household level, the spillover eﬀect is negative and signiﬁcant
at the 10% level when allowing externalities across households up to two kilometers apart. There is
no evidence for bias arising because of spillovers onto households assigned to the control group.

A.11

Attrition bias

In table A.17, we check the robustness of our estimated average household-level intent-to-treat eﬀects
to attrition. As described by Lee (2009), if we assume that assignment to treatment weakly aﬀects
attrition in the same direction for all households (e.g., for all households assignment to treatment
either has no eﬀect on attrition or induces attrition), then we can bound the intent-to-treat eﬀect on
the “never attriters”, i.e., households that would always appear in both rounds of survey data regardless
of treatment assignment. We bound the never-attriter eﬀect using the method described in Lee (2009).
None of our conclusions with respect to household-level outcomes is aﬀected once we account for
attrition as just described.
Among children, the assumptions needed to apply the “never-attriters” approach of Lee (2009)
are inappropriate. Instead, we check for meaningful or statistically signiﬁcant baseline diﬀerences
in anthropometric indicators when comparing households that drop out of the sample to those that
remain. Results are shown in table A.18. We see no evidence of potential bias in our estimated ITTs
for children arising from attrition, and attrition bias does not seem to have diﬀerentially aﬀected boys
relative to girls. Note that we also check the robustness of our results for children to composition of
the sample in appendices A.3, A.20, A.21, and A.22.

A.12

Dropping covariates from child impact models

In table A.19, we estimate average intent-to-treat eﬀects on children without controlling for lagged
outcomes, indicators for having children at baseline, or age. Impacts on weight-for-age, height-forage, and stunting among girls remain large and statistically signiﬁcant. We continue to ﬁnd no eﬀect
of the program on boys. While girls continue to exhibit larger intent-to-treat eﬀects, we can no longer
reject the null that the intent-to-treat eﬀect is equal for boys and girls. Note that point esimates in
table A.19 are all very similar to what we found in table 4 of the main text. Dropping lagged outcomes
increases our standard errors.

include an intercept, thirteen strata indicators, an indicator for not being
interviewed in the follow-up survey round, an indicator for assignment to
the treatment group, and the interaction between the attrition indicators
and the treatment indicator. The “Diﬀerence” column includes all of these
variables interacted with an indicator equal to one for girls. The ﬁrst two
columns show the coeﬃcient on the interaction between the treatment and
attrition indicators, while the third column shows the three-way interaction
between gender, attrition, and treatment.

A.13

Average intent-to-treat eﬀects for children estimated with machine
learning

The method of Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) is useful as a robustness check because it is designed to
mitigate overﬁtting. Checking whether the large impacts on girls show up when using the Chernozhukov et al. (2018b) to estimate average intent-to-treat eﬀects rather than regression on the whole
sample is therefore of interest. We present these results in table A.20 for girls and table A.21. Our
results for girls and boys are robust to changing our estimation approach to one that is based on
machine learning.

A.14

Full machine learning results for child-level outcomes

In this section we show full machine learning results for household-level outcomes. The full results
include 90% conﬁdence intervals for the best linear prediction regression and group average intentto-treat eﬀects, rather than only showing point estimates and indicators of statistical signiﬁcance. We
also show the results of classiﬁcation analysis for all outcomes regardless of evidence for treatment
eﬀect heterogeneity.

A.15

Full machine learning results for household-level outcomes

In this section we show full machine learning results for household-level outcomes. The full results
include 90% conﬁdence intervals for the best linear prediction regression and group average intentto-treat eﬀects, rather than only showing point estimates and indicators of statistical signiﬁcance. We
also show the results of classiﬁcation analysis for all outcomes regardless of evidence for treatment
eﬀect heterogeneity. Note that some measures of treatment eﬀect heterogeneity in tables A.30 and A.31
have q-values below 0.10 and 90% conﬁdence intervals that include zero. This is possible because the
conﬁdence intervals and q-values are median values from the 199 sample splits. The median q-value
for a given parameter estimate might not correspond to the median conﬁdence interval.

Controlling for imbalanced baseline outcomes

As shown in table 1, log calories per adult male equivalent and the number of naked-neck chickens are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in households assigned to treatment and control at baseline. In tables A.40 and
A.41 we verify that our results are robust to including each of these outcomes as observed at baseline
in the covariate set.

Heterogeneous intent-to-treat eﬀects by naked-neck chicken ownership

Naked-neck chicken ownership is not well balanced between the treatment and control groups at
baseline. The baseline data make it clear that imbalance is occurring in the far right tail of the distribution of naked-neck chickens owned. In treatment and control communities, households at the
75th percentile own one naked-neck chicken at baseline. At the 90th , 95th , and 99th percentiles of their
respective baseline distributions, households in treatment communities own ﬁve, ten, and sixteen
naked-neck chickens, while households in the control group own 4, 7.5, and 14 naked-neck chickens
despite top coding the top and bottom 1% of values.
In the tables below we report average intent-to-treat eﬀects on child outcomes for households
with no more than one naked-neck chicken at baseline. The purpose of these robustness checks is to
make sure that our results for child-level impacts are not driven by the subsample exhibiting diﬀerences in baseline naked-neck chicken ownership. The estimated eﬀects were obtained by adding two
variables to the right hand side of our main estimating equations: an indicator for being from a household that owned more than one naked-neck chicken at baseline, and the interaction between assignment to treatment and the new indicator. Changing the regression speciﬁcation in this way ensures
that the coeﬃcient on the treatment group indicator is the estimated intent-to-treat for households
with no more than one naked-neck chicken at baseline.

A.19

Local average treatment eﬀect estimates

In this section we compare estimated intent-to-treat eﬀects and local average treatment eﬀects for
all outcomes of interest, where the latter is the average treatment eﬀect on households who would
enroll in the program if assigned to the treatment group and not otherwise.
The local average treatment eﬀect estimates were obtained using two-stage least squares models where taking the treatment is instrumented by random assignment to cohort 1. We deﬁne being
“treated” has receiving chickens at least six months before follow-up to allow adequate time for impacts on child health. The local average treatment eﬀect is identiﬁed if there are no spillover eﬀects of
the program, being assigned to treatment group only aﬀects the outcome through program participation (i.e., the exclusion restriction holds), and being assigned to the treatment group rather than the
control group either induces a household to enroll in the program or has no eﬀect (i.e., the “monotonicity” assumption (Imbens and Angrist, 1994)). In the present case, the assumption of no spillovers
seems problematic, as there may have been spillovers from program participants to non-participants
within communities. Average distance to the nearest neighbor is 74 meters for households in our
data set, making sales, trade, or gifting chickens and eggs within communities quite plausible. Although we are unable to detect any program impacts on having sold eggs in our analysis, 54 of the 791
households in our ﬁnal data set report selling eggs and doing so primarily within their communities,
while another six households sold outside their communities. We did not ask speciﬁcally about egg
transactions other than sales. Regardless, ruling out intra-community spillovers seems like a strong
assumption in the present case. We include local average treatment eﬀect estimates solely for comparison’s sake.
Covariates are the same in intent-to-treat regressions and our two-stage least squares models.
We perform inference on the local average treatment eﬀects using the wild cluster bootstrap (Roodman et al., 2019). We report p-values because of diﬃculties with the grid search required to obtain 95%
conﬁdence intervals with the wild cluster bootstrap. As we would expect, the local average treatment
eﬀect estimates are larger in absolute value and less precise than the intent-to-treat eﬀects. Among

128

girls, local average treatment eﬀects and intent-to-treat eﬀects are statistically signiﬁcant for the same
outcomes. But signiﬁcance of the former is not robust to adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Impacts on children, including infants under six months of age

In the main text, we describe our justiﬁcation for focusing on children between the ages of six and
60 months. But it is possible that younger children beneﬁted from the program through improved
nutrition among mothers. We therefore check the robustness of our results to including children
youngers than six months of age in tables A.56 through A.59. None of our conclusions are aﬀected.

Impacts on children excluding households with no children at baseline

It is possible that fertility decision would be aﬀected by the program. Impacts on fertility would not
imply that our results are biased, but would alter the interpretation of the results. In tables A.60
through A.63 we re-estimate impacts on children only using the subsample of households with children at baseline. None of our conclusions are aﬀected by this change in the sample.

Impacts on children who were alive at baseline

In table A.64 we estimate impacts on children who are observed at baseline and follow up. None
of the eﬀects on boys are statistically signiﬁcant once we adjust for multiple comparisons. Still, the
impacts on boys shown in table A.64 are diﬀerent enough from what we obtain in the main text that
we explore potential explanations in this subsection of the appendix. The explanations we consider
are: balance between treatment and control becomes substantially worse after limiting the sample
to households with children observed in both rounds, survivor bias in the sample of boys (i.e., the
program allowed boys with poor anthropometric statistics to surive, dragging down impacts), and
duration of exposure to the program (i.e., children observed in both rounds are relatively old and
therefore exposed to the program longer).

In table A.65 we show sample balance when restricting the data to households with children
observed at baseline. There is no evidence that restricting the sample to households with children
observed in both survey rounds leads to spurious results because of a lack of balance. We therefore
reject lack of balance as an explanation.
Next we consider survivor bias. Survivor bias could arise if boys observed at baseline who would
not survive to the second survey round if assigned to the control group do survive when assigned to
the treatment group, dragging down estimated impacts on anthropometric indicators among boys.
This explanation seems very unlikely, since only two children under the age of 60 months who were
observed at basleine did not survive until follow-up. But impacts on survivorship could manifest
themselves in children born after baseline data collection. To explore this, we drop children observed
at baseline and estimate the impacts of assignment to the treatment group on number of boys per
household. The estimated intent-to-treat eﬀect on the number of boys under 60 months of age at
follow-up (excluding children observed at baseline) is -0.070 boys (p-value = 0.222). The sign of the
eﬀect is the opposite of what we would expect with survivor bias, and it is imprecisely estimated. In
other words, we see no evidence of survivor bias among boys. For sake of comparison, the same eﬀect
estimated for girls under the age of 60 months is 0.049 (p-value = 0.379).
Ultimately, we are left with a bit of a puzzle. Impacts on girls are largely unaﬀected by changing
the sample composition, which is reassuring. Impacts on boys appear larger for children who were
alive at baseline, but it is hard to know how much to emphasize these results given that signiﬁcant
impacts are bound to show up if one slices the sample repeatedly. One possibility that diﬀerences in
impacts by whether a boy is observed at baseline are a result of heterogeneous treatment eﬀects by
age. However, checking whether controlling for treatment eﬀect heterogeneity by age can explain
diﬀerences in impacts on boys observed and not observed at baseline is not an appealing approach.
The problem is that there is very little overlap in age across boys observed at baseline and not observed
at baseline. Estimating the treatment eﬀect on boys not observed at baseline holding age ﬁxed at the
same average age observed among boys that are observed at baseline would require a great deal of
extrapolation. Our conclusion is that program eﬀects on girls are highly robust, whereas eﬀects on
