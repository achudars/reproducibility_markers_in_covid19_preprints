Assessment of Management Commitment in Malaysian Public Sector
Abstract
At present, the public sector is a matter of global concern due to the constant cases of failures
in governance, fraud, inefficacy, and corruption. Management commitment is a critical issue
as lack of it could lead to failures in governance, fraud, inefficacy, corruption as well as weak
financial management, particularly in the public sector. This study evaluated the state of
present practices of management commitment among public sector employees from various
Malaysian service schemes. Primary data were collected using a questionnaire survey
approach with 194 heads of departments in the Malaysian federal ministries. The collection
of data was in accordance with the perspective of 10 factors in management commitment
practices, using a five-point Likert scale. Factor analysis and descriptive statistics were
utilized for data analysis. In addition, data reliability was checked by Cronbach’s alpha test,
data normality was examined by Skewness and Kurtosis tests, and data validity was tested by
using Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test and Barlett’s test. The findings show that 97% of the
participants reported that they practised management commitment within their departments.
Nevertheless, the priority for these management commitment factors varied according to the
service schemes. In general, management commitment practice was the highest within the
groups that used the finance scheme and the lowest among the employees who were under
the accounting and audit schemes. The result of the study will help policy makers to take
necessary steps to improve the practices of management commitment in the public sector in
order to create a more dependable and efficient public sector in Malaysia.

Introduction
Management commitment is vital and considered as a crucial and desirable element in
employee’s behavior (Aladwan, Bhanugopan & Fish, 2013). This is because the success of an
organization can be ensured by the commitment from the management. Management
commitment, especially from the top management represents an emotional commitment,
conviction, intention or a strong attitude towards pursuing a goal, and it will affect the
employee performance-related behavior (William, Morrell & Mullane, 2014).
The synonyms that are often used to describe the term commitment relate loyalty, allegiance,
engagement, and attachment (Lamsa & Savolainen, 2000). Many researchers have tried to
define the nature of commitment; however, among the researchers, there is no agreement
with regard to defining its nature (Goffin & Szwejczewski, 1996). The concept of
management commitment has been extensively researched over the last 20 years, and every
researcher has his or her own explanations regarding this term. However, most of the
researchers have come to the same agreement that management commitment has a
relationship with the goals and values of the organization. For example, Chiu and Chen
(2016) found a positive significant effect of the management commitment on the
organizational effectiveness.
Management commitment can be defined as engaging the behaviors of the
management (Goffin & Szwejczewski, 1996), willingness to exert considerable effort on
behalf of the organization (Mowday et al., 1979), and having a strong desire to maintain
membership of the organization. In another point of view, management commitment is
2

defined as the employees’ feeling of obligation to stay with the organization, and the feelings
are resulted from the internalization of normative pressures exerted on an individual prior to
entry or following entry (Hashim, 2010). However, the meaning has been evolved into a
complex concept that can serve as a summary index of work-related experiences and as a
predictor of work behaviors intentions (Jaros et al., 1993).
Management commitment can be divided into different perspectives, and behavioral
and psychological perspectives are the examples of the approach of management
commitment. Behavioral approach is related to the output of the reward or contribution
exchange processes between employers and employees; on the other hand, psychological
approach is related to commitment of the management from the point of view of the
attachment or identification of employees with the organization where they work (Salim et
al., 2010).
According to Cooper (2006), management commitment behaviors can have impact on
the employee behavior since different management levels exert different effects on employee
behavior. In other words, commitment is shaped by the way an individual is managed
(Metcalfe & Dick, 2001). The same notion was supported by Bennett (2002), who mentioned
that the aspect of organizational management might result in employee absence due to low
job satisfaction, the organizing of the means of the task or work context and organizational
commitment. On the other hand, it is observed that one of the major reasons for failure of the
firms is due to the lack of commitment from the top management (Goffin & Szwejczewski,
1996).
Although recognition of management commitment is universal, few authors have tried
to identify the essential components of management commitment. In addition, it is found that
participation of top management in quality programs, specific quality goals and
comprehensive quality planning are examples of those components (Goffin & Szwejczewski,
1996). This finding is supported by the statement of William et al. (2014), and in their study,
they proposed that top management commitment not only increased the job satisfaction
among the workers but also might have impact on an organization’s performance as well.
This study examines the practices of management commitment in the public sector of
Malaysia. This study selected Malaysian context as an area of research since many recent
issues are found in the public sector, and they relate corruption, fraud, governance failures,
poor financial management, etc. These occurrences have raised numerous enquiries about the
accountability of the public sector in its obligation to uphold the public’s trust. This study
hopes to help the government to find out the factors that will be able to nurture and promote
the accountability value, using sound management commitment practices in the government
sector.
Research Methodology
Data Collection and Sampling
The current study collected data, using a questionnaire survey filled by heads of departments
of six Malaysian federal ministries in January – June 2016. The six selected ministries
include:- (i) the Ministry of Education, (ii) the Ministry of Communication and Multimedia,
(iii) the Ministry of Defence, (iv) the Ministry of Health, (v) the Ministry of Rural and
Regional Development, and (vi) the Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry. These
3

ministries were chosen since these ministries were frequently found reprimanded in the
Auditor General Report for three consecutive years, i.e. from 2012 to 2014 in relation to
issues, such as integrity, accountability, mismanagement, and ethics.
There are 402 sub-departments in total under these six ministries. The target of the
study was 210 samples, using the systematic random sampling method along with using
every two listed departments in each ministry. The selection began with a department’s
second list followed by the fourth list, the sixth list, etc. until it reached 402 and ended up
with 210 items in the samples. Lastly, 194 questionnaires from 210 target samples were
employed in the data analysis.
The present study properly maintained the compliance of ethical standard of the
respected institutions of the authors as well as of the respondents. The questionnaire was
finalized based on the ethical clearance from the ethical committee of the affiliated institution
of the main author of the research. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the individual level
data were collected only for academic research purpose, and it were kept strictly confidential
only among the researchers.
Measurements of Variables
The participants were required to offer their perspective on the practices that promoted
management commitment in their department by utilizing a five-point Likert scale that
ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The management commitment were
measured by using 10 items that were adapted from the study of Geer (2009), Gollmar (2008)
and Hopkins, O'Neil and Williams (2007). Table 1 provides in details the measurement that is
used in this study.

Moreover, to reduce the respondents’ inclination to describe themselves in a biased
way, this study took consideration by including few “experimental/indirect” questions in the
survey questionnaire that was supposed to control the self-reporting and self-rating baseness
(Fisher, 1993).
Analysis of Data

4

The collected data were analysed, using the descriptive statistics and factor analysis
techniques. Descriptive statistics is normally utilized to analyse the overall features of the
data; on the other hand, factor analysis is utilized to calculate data consistency in the study. In
addition, the data reliability of the current study was measured by utilizing the Cronbach’s
alpha test and data normality was examined by Skewness and Kurtosis tests. Lastly, the data
validity was tested by using Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test and Barlett’s test.

The results of the study demonstrated that 59.3% of the respondents were female. As
much as 38% of the respondents were in the 41-50 years old age group followed by 33% in
the 31-40 years old age group. Most of the respondents were Malays, comprising 90.7%. All
the respondents had a minimum qualification of a bachelor degree. The job positions of
90.7% of the respondents were management and professionals. 40% of the respondents were
in the administrative job scheme, and 23.7% were in financial services, with only 5.2% in
accounting job scheme. The remaining 7.7% were from various other departments, such as
officers in the tax, legal, health, education, information & technology, and procurement
departments.
Factor Analysis
5

Factor analysis was used to ensure the consistency of the variables and to determine the
management commitment. In this study, the factor loading of all the variables were higher
than 0.6 with exceptions on items MC5, MC8 and MC9 as observed in Table 3. Thus, after
removing these variables, the factor loading values ranged from 0.64 (MC1) to 0.9 (MC7).
This shows that 7 out 10 variables are usable in measuring management commitment of the
Malaysian public sector.
Descriptive Analysis
Service Scheme wise Evaluation
Based on all the groups of service schemes, the average highest result for all the management
commitment factors was measured at 4.6 by the group on finance scheme, and the mean
lowest score was measured at 4.3 by the group on accounting and audit scheme (Table 3).

The group on accounting service scheme scored a total average of 4.3; on the other
hand, its highest score was measured at 4.6 for MC6 and lowest score was measured at 4.0
for MC8. Moreover, the score for factors MC1, MC2, MC5, and MC9 were lower compared
with the average management commitment scores of the group. The group on administrative
scheme’s average total score was measured at 4.5; on the contrary, the highest score was
measured at 4.9 for the MC6 and MC7 factors and the lowest score was measured at 4.3 for
MC2, MC5, MC8, and MC9. In addition, the score for MC1was lower than the average
management commitment scores of the group. The group on audit scheme’s average total
score was measured at 4.3 while the highest score was measured at 4.6 for the MC7 factor,
and the lowest score was measured at 4.0 for the MC9 factor. Moreover, scores for MC4 was
lower compared with the average management commitment scores of the group. The group
on finance scheme’s average total score was measured at 4.6; on the other hand, the highest
score was measured at 4.9 for the MC6 and MC7 factors, and the lowest score was measured
at 4.3 for MC8 and MC9 factors. Additionally, the scores for MC1, MC2, and MC5 were
lower compared with the overall average management commitment scores of the group.
Factor wise Evaluation
The study attempted to measure the management commitment practice in the public sector,
using 10 variables. Based on the respondents of the current study, it is observed that a total
average of 97% agreed that they practiced the management commitment factors as shown in
Table 4. Based on all the factors of management commitment, the highest mean score was at
6

4.6 for factors MC10. However, the lowest mean score was at 4.2 for factors (MC8) and
(MC9) as shown in Table 3.

Based on the factors on practicing management commitment in the public sector, it is
found that 96.9% of the respondents claimed that their department is establishing policies
and plans to achieve the goals (MC1) as shown in Table 4. The employees who used the
scheme on finance regarded that the most, and the employees who used the scheme on
accounting perceived that to be the least as shown in Table 3.
However, 97.9% of the participants regarded providing training and ongoing support
for all staff to discharge their duties (MC2) as shown in Table 4; on the contrary, the
employees who used the scheme on finance perceived that as the most, and those in the
accounting scheme perceived that to be the least as shown in Table 3.
95.9% of the participants regarded establishing effective 2-way communication system
with the staff (MC3) as shown in Table 4; on the other hand, the employees who used the
scheme on finance perceived that as the most, and those in the accounting scheme perceived
that to be the least as shown in Table 3. Based on the results of the other schemes on service,
employees in the audit scheme practised that lesser compared to the average level.
97.4% of the participants agreed to create the environment of continuous
improvement. (MC4) as shown in Table 4. The employees who used the scheme on finance
scheme possessed that the most; on the other hand, the employees who used the scheme on
audit possessed that the least as shown in Table 3. Based on the results of the other schemes
on service, employees in the accounting scheme practised that lesser compared to the average
level.
97.9% of the participants agreed that they have proper arrangements for the
supervision and appraisal of the staff (MC6) as shown in Table 4. The employees who used
the scheme on finance and administrative schemes possessed that the most; on the contrary,
the employees who used the scheme on audit possessed that the least as shown in Table 3.
Moreover, based on the results of the other schemes on service, it is observed that employees
in the accounting scheme practised that lesser compared to the average level.

7

97.9% of the participants agreed that that they regularly review and assess the
performance of staff individually (MC7) as shown in Table 4. The employees who used the
scheme on administration and finance practiced that the most; on the other hand, the
employees who used the scheme on accounting practised that the least as shown in Table 3.
Based on the results of the other schemes on service, it is found that employees in the audit
scheme practised that lesser compared to the average level.
96.9% of the participants agreed that they are ensuring control at all level of
organization (MC10) as shown in Table 4. For this factor, it is found that the participants in
the administration scheme practiced that the most; on the contrary, those in the accounting
and audit scheme practiced that the least as shown in Table 3.
Diagnostic Tests
Skewness and Kurtosis tests were used to carry out the normality testing. Skewness can be
defined as something that is out of the line depending on the extension of the curve if it
curves out to the right or left. When the curve extends more to the right, that is known as
positively skewed, and when it extends more to the left, that is known as negatively skewed
(Wuensch, 2014). On the other hand, Kurtosis measures how flat the symmetric distribution
is at the top. The rule that is observed for both the skewness and kurtosis and to be considered
that the data is normally distributed, the range of the values need to be from -2 to +2. When
the skewness and kurtosis values are in this range, the data distribution is considered normal.
Nevertheless, in this study, the skewness value is -3.55; on the other hand, the value of the
kurtosis is 16.78, and this indicates that the value is outside of the range of normality. This
signifies that that the data is not normally distributed. However, Field (2013) suggests that the
data can be considered normal if they exceed thirty, and here the sample size of the study is
194. The reliability testing for factors of management commitment is provided in Table 5.

The Cronbach’s alpha value on management commitment as shown in Table 5 is
0.877, and this means that the reliability of the items in the questionnaire is excellent (George
& Mallery, 2016). The test’s eigenvalues indicate that the factors utilized for management
commitment is able to explain 91.22 % of the variance. The Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test shows a
greater value than 0.6, at 0.726. The Barlett’s Test Sphericity Approx. Chi-Square determines
the value’s significance (Chi-Square = 2056.1, p < 0.0000001). Thus, the sample is adequate
for utilization in the factor analysis for measuring the management commitment.
Discussions of the Findings
Malaysia has a vision of reaching a developed nation status by the 2020; however, many
steps must be undertaken to improve the management commitment level of the public service
sector (Said et al., 2016; Aziz et al. 2015). This study attempted to measure the level of the
8

present practices of management commitment in the Malaysian public sector by evaluating
the effects of 10 factors.
A total of 97% respondents claimed that in general, they practice the mentioned
factors of management commitment; nevertheless, various service schemes prioritized the 10
factors differently. In general, the management commitment practice in the group with the
finance scheme was the highest and lowest among the employees under the accounting and
audit schemes. This might be the reason for the presence of several areas of weaknesses,
corruption, and weak controls of asset management that were reported in the recent official
report by the Auditor General.
The government continuously initiates programmes that aim to promote and motivate
the practices of management commitment in all the departments in the public sector in order
for them to be more transparent in carrying out their duties. However, the initiation has not
given the expected impact as reported in the 2014 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) by
Transparency International, where Malaysia has only improved by three ranks from 53 to 50
among 175 countries; this shows that the measures and efforts undertaken for fighting graft
are still insufficient (Zainal, 2014). In addition, this demonstrates that although the
government has taken the right steps to improve the public’s perception, there are still many
more steps that must be undertaken to increase the confidence of the public towards the good
governance of the public sector. Therefore, it is insufficient to just change the structures of
bureaucracy to improve this situation. The public sector needs to be transformed to create an
efficient and reliable sector to ensure adequate accountability and an effective evaluation
system (Said et al., 2015). Improvements in the management commitment practices would be
able to assist the achievement of the intentions of the stakeholders and to make sure that there
is accountability in the public sector.
Conclusions
The occurrences of various reported mismanagement cases, involving the issues, such as
corruption, fraud, governance failures, and poor financial management have raised numerous
enquiries about the accountability of the public sector agencies in Malaysia. This study was
carried out to examine the practices of management commitment in the Malaysian public
sector so as to confirm the level of commitment from the management. It is found that the
management commitment practice in the finance scheme group scored the highest
commitment value whereas the accounting and audit schemes scored the lowest commitment
value. The findings of the present study would assist the various departments and agencies in
the government to improve their level of management commitment in accordance with the
related service schemes. In addition, the factors of management commitment measures and
approaches utilized in this study could assist the government in creating techniques for the
measurements of accountability in the public sector.
Nevertheless, this study also faced several limitations that could be addressed in
future researches. In this study, only 6 ministries were taken into consideration even though
there are 24 ministries in Malaysia, and the survey only included heads of departments. The
levels of management commitment practices could be different in the other ministries and
among other government officers that could be addressed in future researches. It is also
recommended that each department and ministry would produce or report their activities of
management commitment and ethics and ensure that they enhance to create a culture of good
governance in the various departments in the public sector. The report should be made
9

available to the public to create awareness and to educate them on the important steps that
could be undertaken to reduce employee misconduct in the government.
