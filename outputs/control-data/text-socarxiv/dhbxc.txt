Abstract
Teaching and learning literature could be a daunting task for both instructors and learners. It
requires teachers to employ suitable approaches and methodologies to ensure the effectiveness of
the lesson. This serves as the main purpose of this study which is to discover the approaches
employed by literature teachers. In addition, three significant dimensions will also be scrutinised
which are locality, literature training and teaching experience. Utilizing questionnaire as the
research instrument, this study involved 271 teachers as the respondents. Comparisons pertaining
to the approaches employed based on locality, training and teaching experience were shown in the
findings. To note, the majority of the respondents were found to be in favor of using simple
terminologies as the most preferred approach. Meanwhile, the least favored approach was eliciting
information from students. In addition, out of the three main variables, only teaching experience
was found to show no significant difference. To summarise, locality, training and teaching
experience may have significantly impacted teachers in selecting the approaches to be employed
in a literature lesson. This may also assist in ensuring that the teaching and learning of literature
reach its visions.

The Influence of Locality, Training and Teaching Experience

Suliman, Yunus & Nor

Introduction
In the English language subject, literature is an inevitable element embedded in its curriculum. It
is regarded to be a form of art, combining the expression of meaning and linguistic repertoire.
Chen (2012) asserts that literature enhances and nurtures the cultural knowledge of an individual
as the inter-relation between language, culture and literature is prevalent and significant.
Furthermore, it transforms a contextual form into abstract imagination by means of wonderful
poetic devices. Similarly, Carter and Long (1991) believe that due to its importance in language
learning, literature aids in developing students’ cultural knowledge. Holding to these two premises,
the association between language and literature is crucial as they complement each other in the
learning process.
It is interesting to note that a number of countries in which English is not their official
language have integrated the teaching of English literature in their schools. Novianti (2016) affirms
that English literature study in Indonesia is highly inseparable from English language studies, and
it does not differ much from other countries, where English is a foreign language. Chen (2012)
points out that there is a reform and opening-up in promoting the teaching of literature besides
learning English in China though it is less promising in the country. On top of that, Njagi, Muriungi
& Peter (2014); Okwara, Shiundu & Indoshi (2009) affirm that English teaching as well as
Literature teaching in Kenya are taught simultaneously via an integrated approach, implying that
Literature would be the means of teaching English and vice versa. Other countries executing
similar discipline include Turkey (Saka, 2014), Bangladesh (Farjana, 2016) and Romania
(Padurean, 2015).
The wave is also indisputable in Malaysia. English literature has been made a compulsory
component in the teaching of English syllabus since 2000. The literature component which is
perceived as a means to elevate the proficiency level among Malaysian students encompasses
various genres such as poem, short stories, drama and novel (Yusof, Lazim & Salehuddin, 2017;
Suliman & Yunus, 2014). Two primary objectives demonstrated via the teaching of the component
are engaging learners with enjoyable literary texts suitable to their language proficiency and
enhancing creativity in being expressive. Muthusamy et al. (2017) state that the teaching and
learning of literature in Malaysia is fast becoming a recognized force in acquiring language
proficiency. Learning literature indirectly assists in developing English language mastery.
Learners will be introduced to new words and poetic devices which are rarely uttered in daily
conversations besides being able to explore different settings portrayed in the literary texts. These
are some of the beautiful elements gained by learning literature.
Teaching literature might be easy as it is associated with language teaching as asserted by
Chalikendy (2015) and Violetta-Irene (2015). However, this view is opposed by Novianti (2016)
who claims that teaching canonical texts poses many challenges and needs to be undertaken well.
On top of that, literature teaching would still pose a big challenge to schools as faced by teachers
and students (Ortells, 2013; Tuncer & Kizildag, 2014). Even though literature is associated with
language learning, there will be difficulties if suitable approaches and methodologies are not
employed. This requires teachers to arm themselves with the skills needed to teach literature. The
methodologies and approaches might differ from what is practiced in the language lessons because
as claimed by Padurean (2015), English Literature should be approached differently since the

language used is too complicated. Hence, teaching approaches, methods and strategies employed
in teaching literature should be suitable, varied, innovative and effective to maximize the teaching
process (Chen, 2012; Yunus & Suliman, 2014; Hussein & Al-Emami, 2016; Muthusamy et al.,
2017).
Teaching and learning foreign literature could be a daunting task for both the instructors
and learners (Hussein & Al-Emami, 2016). This affirms that literature teaching and learning
requires a distinguishable method for it to be mastered. Though it may be similar to language
teaching and learning, the pedagogical and methodological aspects vary. As the use of literal
meanings is common in literature, it may require special assistance from teachers to assist students’
understanding. As revealed by Yunus and Suliman (2014), teachers lack ideas in making a
literature lesson meaningful, and this is supported by Muthusamy et al. (2017) whose study showed
that most teachers claimed that teaching literature is the most difficult thing to do. On the contrary,
students might face difficulties to fathom a literary text as a result of limited language mastery as
affirmed by Novianti (2016) and Sunardi et al. (2018), that limited language proficiency impedes
students in understanding literary texts especially classical ones. In detail, the most common
problem is the teachers’ uneasiness to cope with a wide range of genres (poetry, novel, short
stories, and drama) besides the absence of training in literature and the issue of literary jargon
mastery (Berrarbi & Bahous, 2018). This leads to the foundation of this study. Locality, training
and teaching experience are imperative in influencing teachers’ approaches to teaching literature.
This study intends to answer the following research questions:
a. What is the comparison in the teaching approaches employed based on locality, training
and teaching experience?
b. What is the relationship between locality and teaching approaches employed?
c. What is the relationship between training and teaching approaches employed?
d. What is the relationship between teaching experience and teaching approaches employed?
Literature Review
Moody as cited in Hwang and Embi (2007) explains that the relevance of an approach is “to
provide a framework, a sequence of operations to be used when we come to actualities”. The right
approach will aid teachers’ teaching which in return leads to students’ better understanding. There
is a link between approaches and types of activities conducted in literature lesson. Whenever a
teacher uses a suitable approach, it may affect students’ interest in and comprehension of the
lesson. Especially in the context of second language, literature should be taught using a different
pedagogical approach for non-native speakers (Padurean, 2015). Therefore, it matters for the
teachers to select the appropriate approaches in literature lesson. The four literature teaching
approaches are as follows:
Information-based Approach
This approach relies heavily on teachers’ giving students the input related to the lesson. According
to Carter, as cited in Hwang and Embi (2007), this approach is seen to offer a source of information
to the students and a means of imparting knowledge on literature. The teachers are required to
provide students the needed input for them to engage in the lesson. Carter and Long (1991) also
believe that the approach involves critical concepts, literary conventions, and meta-language which

entitle students to make use of the terms and concepts during their discussion of a literary topic.
The input may vary in terms of historical, cultural, political and social aspects apart from the
historical background of the text. This highlights the role of the teacher in providing input to the
students. Lecturing, reading notes, giving critiques and explaining are among the activities listed
under this approach.
Language-based Approach
This approach reiterates what Carter and Long (1991) describe as the Language Model. This
approach entitles students’ language proficiency and competency to be developed. It exposes
students to the language and teachers will then need to introduce the language elements involved.
This is seen to be a two-pronged approach in which literary texts cater language activities besides
functioning as a source of knowledge and information. Too as cited in Rashid, Vethamani and
Rahman (2010), asserts that, with the use of language-based approach, the focus shifted to the
learner, the reading process and creating language awareness in the learners. This approach
exposes learners to various kinds of language elements such as lexis, syntax, phonology, semantics
and graphology. Poetry recital, debate, role play, prediction, ranking tasks and forum are among
the suggested activities in this approach since it is more students-centred.
Personal-response Approach
As opposed to information-based approach, this approach emphasises students’ roles in learning
literature. Hwang and Embi (2007) assert that this approach emphasises on students giving
responses about a text. Moreover, as students will have to respond to the issues discussed in the
text, their personal development will indirectly be enhanced. The reason is to motivate and
encourage students to read by making a connection between the themes of a text and his or her
personal life and experiences (Talif, 1995). Students’ responses are perceived to be personal as it
deals with the affective aspect. For this approach, brainstorming, group discussion, writing
students’ reactions, question-discussion and journal writing are among the suggested activities.
Paraphrastic Approach
According to Hwang and Embi (2007), this approach deals with the surface of the text. It refers to
paraphrasing or re-telling the text in a simpler version. The purpose of this approach is to ease
students’ understanding apart from translating it into another language. Talif (1995) argues that
this approach assists beginners as it aids in formulating an initial idea of a text. In the context of
Malaysian classrooms, some foreign literary texts may halt students’ understanding as the
language used is slightly different from what is commonly uttered. This requires paraphrastic
approach to be applied. Hence, the suggested activities are retelling the text in a simpler language,
translating using the mother tongue and reading the paraphrased version of the text.
Studies on Literature Approaches
In Romania, Padurean (2015) finds that literature teachers employed less student-centered learning
and note-taking was the only student activity. In fact, 43% of the respondents claimed that they
were never asked opinion on the text learnt. Farjana (2016) discovers a reliance on teachers and a
preference for simplified versions of literary texts. In Malaysia, Hwang and Embi (2007) disclose
that the paraphastic approach was a popular approach to teaching literature among the teachers in
their study. However, Rashid, Vethamani, and Rahman (2010) reveal that the information-based

approach was the most popular approach in eighteen secondary schools in Kelantan. Due to
students’ incompetency of the language, teachers had to resort to spoon-feeding the students in
literature lessons.
Sidhu, Chan, and Kaur (2010) inform that teachers spent a lot of time on individual
comprehension work, had lesser literary elements integration and lacked creativity in managing
learning activities. In addition, Suliman and Yunus (2014) explain that their respondents preferred
to use simpler terms in giving explanation as well as probing questions in the teaching process.
Yunus and Suliman (2014) as well as Muthusamy et al. (2017) come to disclose that different
preferred techniques and approaches in teaching literature such as note-copying, presentation, class
discussions and autonomous learning. All these studies have demonstrated that different settings
may opt for different approaches in teaching literature.
Locality Factor
The learning of English language in the rural area can be seen challenging because the students
might have limited exposure to the target language. The integration of literature serves as a
challenge especially to students with low English proficiency, even though it is a promising move
in language and literature learning for Malaysian students (MELTA, 2012). Therefore, they face
difficulties in learning English language in schools. Suliman and Yunus (2014) argue that the
teaching and learning process may be affected by the surrounding the teacher is in. Yang (2014)
claims that most rural teachers are young and have just graduated from schools. They might lack
working experiences and might be novice in the teaching field. As opposed to schools in the rural
area, urban schools recruit more highly qualified teachers and provide greater curricular variety
and educational resources (Khattri et al. cited in Freeman & Anderson, 2005). Mahmud and Bray
(2017) ascertain that since the costs of living are higher in urban than rural areas, the pressures on
urban teachers may be higher and the teachers in turn exert pressures on their students.
Furthermore, the quality of teachers is often lower in rural than urban areas because better qualified
personnel prefer to live in cities.
In relation to the quality of rural area teachers, Lin (2011) argues that many rural teachers
were found to be working in a more mechanical way than allocating time in preparing a lesson
using various techniques. This may be due to the lack of facilities in rural schools, leaving teachers
to employ more traditional methods in the lesson. This requires critical improvement to better the
situation. U.S. Department of Education as cited in Hudson and Hudson (2008) states that rural
and remote schools teachers may be isolated, requiring them to be supported, monitored and
mentored. This highlights the positive sides of the rural area to the novices by focusing on the preservice teachers level. This also describes the worrying situation occurring in rural schools which
needs to be upgraded and improved.
Trained versus Non-trained
In the teaching of literature, it is deemed crucial for the teachers to equip themselves with proper
training so they will be better prepared in teaching. The training encompasses both content
knowledge and methodologies in making a lesson meaningful. It was also discovered earlier by
Subramaniam, Hamdan and Koo (2003) that only 42% from the 500 respondents assured that they
had sufficient methodological skills in teaching literature. Having said that, Yunus and Suliman

Suliman, Yunus & Nor

(2014) affirm that most respondents in their study relied heavily in getting students to copy notes
from resource books. This indicates that teachers lack methodological and pedagogical skills that
can be maximised in a literature lesson. Perhaps, this is caused by a lack of training that the teachers
are in dire need of. Trainings are not only restricted to those obtained during student teachers’
study years. In fact, on-going and continuous trainings are essential as they would be the avenue
to disseminate more updated and current skills in teaching literature.
On another note, on-going training may develop the quality of teachers especially for those
who are non-option English Language teachers. According to Goh and Kwong, as cited in
Bipinchandra, Shah and Aziz (2014), sustained language training programmes are essential to
improve the quality of non-option English language teachers. Indubitably, the courses and
trainings will enable teachers to arm themselves and refresh their existing knowledge related to
literature. Literature requires different ways of teaching, unlike any language lesson. Teachers
need to vary their strategies to ensure students are engaged with the lesson. With proper training,
teachers may be better in managing the lessons as well as arousing students’ interest in literature
lesson. Classroom practices are influenced by the interaction between teachers’ beliefs and several
dimensions such as schooling, professional training and contextual factor (Shah, Othman &
Senom, 2017). Hence, getting involved in trainings and courses related to literature is highly
recommended to exude a more positive learning environment.
Experienced versus Novice Teachers
It is imperative to get to the literal meaning of experienced and novice teachers. As defined by Hsu
(2009), novice teachers are those who are still undergoing training, have just completed training,
or have just commenced teaching and still have very little experience behind them. On the other
hand, Gatbonton (2008) defines experienced teachers as those with many years of teaching
experience behind them, at least four to five years. It can be deduced that novice teachers are new
in the teaching field whereas experienced ones would have at least gained a few years of experience
in the teaching industry. Novice may also infer to the ones still searching for the solid ground in
teaching while at the same seeking assistance from experienced teachers. Abbas and Niloofar
(2012) further define qualified teachers as those using their experience as the foundation in the
strategies employed besides planning both long-term and short-term plans as opposed to the
novices. Novice teachers were also found to see a class as a whole as compared to the experienced
who perceived a class as comprising of unique individuals. However, Abbas and Niloofar (2012)
mention that both teachers view the effect of motivation on their efficacy indifferently.
Meyer (2003) makes a comparison between experienced and novice teachers. He believes
that the novices lack experiences to organise their thinking into useful constructs for making
predictions about future events. On the opposite, the experienced teachers have well-developed
knowledge bases and organizations that are responsive to multiple external and internal cues and
are highly linked allowing for flexible patterns of organization and problem solving. He even adds
that, through the strategies employed, novice teachers reinforce their conceptions of prior
knowledge and its importance in learning to find out their students’ prior knowledge. This opposes
the practices of the experienced teachers because experienced teachers act intentionally when they
assess their students’ prior knowledge. In another view, Hattie (2003) claims that experienced
teachers concentrate more on what they are doing and saying in a class, while the novices

concentrate more on students’ behaviour. Thus, novices are more focused on students, unlike the
experienced ones who perceive classroom management as their fundamental goal. This is agreed
by Unal and Unal (2012).
Methodology
The study is quantitative in nature, employing a survey research design. A questionnaire was used
in order to obtain the data. The instrument, which is a four-point Likert-scale questionnaire was
adapted from Hwang and Embi (2007). The instrument of the study is made up of two sections,
demographic profile of the respondents and the approaches employed in teaching literature. There
are five questions in the demographic profile of the respondents namely gender, option, locality,
teaching experience and literature training. Meanwhile, the construct on the approaches to teaching
literature has thirteen items. Overall, there are eighteen questions in the instrument. A pilot study
was conducted for reliability of the instrument. Cronbach’s Alpha value of 0.88 obtained indicated
the reliability of the instrument.
Regarding the samples of the study, 271 secondary school English teachers who teach
English literature were invited to be involved in the study. They were selected based on cluster
sampling. The data obtained were analysed using a statistical software. Descriptive statistics
involving mean and frequency were generated in order for the comparison of each category to be
made. Meanwhile, inferential statistics – T-test and ANOVA – were employed to determine the
relationship between the variables. This is meant to investigate the differences between all
categories and the approaches employed in teaching literature. The results are in the following
section.

Table 2 shows the mean score for the approaches employed by teachers based on locality. It is
prevalent that rural area teachers have higher mean score in comparison to urban teachers. In detail,
teachers from the urban area were more interested to use simple terminologies to explain about the
texts. This is also reflected in rural area teachers’ findings. For the second most preferred approach,
urban area teachers were in favour of encouraging students to relate a text to their personal
experiences and asking students questions was ranked third. On the other hand, rural teachers’
second most preferred approach was asking students questions while explaining the content of a
text appeared to be the third most preferred approach. Regarding the lowest scoring item, both
groups showed that eliciting information from students about the text was the least favoured
approach. In fact, the other two lowest scoring items were similar, setting language activities and
generating language practice using the text, which were ranked twelfth and eleventh. To prove the
difference between the two localities and the approaches employed, the table below reveals the
result.

The Influence of Locality, Training and Teaching Experience

Suliman, Yunus & Nor

An independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the approaches employed by the
respondents in terms of locality. There was a significant difference in the scores for the teachers
in the urban area (mean=3.164, s.d.=.305) and those in the rural area (mean=3.270, s.d.=.322);
(t=2.767, p=.006).
It is interesting to note that rural area teachers were more positive with the approaches in
literature lesson. This finding opposes Mahmud and Bray (2017), who state that the quality of
teachers is often lower in rural than urban areas because better qualified personnel prefer to live in
cities. The findings are in line to Yang (2014) who claims that rural area teachers are commonly
the novices who have been teaching for a few years. This may imply that they are very enthusiastic
about teaching and willing to try various approaches that may suit their teaching best. Their ideas
and suggestions may differ from the urban area teachers who are more into traditional pedagogical
skills as proposed by Khattri et al. as cited in Freeman and Anderman (2005). This may also be
reflected in the findings through the second most favoured approach by the urban area teachers,
encouraging students to relate a text to their personal experiences. As they are more experienced
in teaching, they can utilize this approach better, unlike the rural area teachers who might lack
experience.
Talif (1995) proposes that using simple terminologies assists novice teachers as it aids in
formulating an initial idea of a text. In addition, Berrarbi and Bahous (2018) assert that students
are less encouraged to be exposed to linguistically or culturally complex texts by teachers. For
students who have just started learning literature, they need something light and easy to read and
comprehend. As literature revolves around poetic and literary devices which are uncommon among
the students, teachers need to explain the text in a simpler version that could ease students’
understanding. This further supports Carter and Long (1991) who claim that literature is teachercentred in which teachers pass knowledge and information to the students. Hence, using simple
terminologies in explaining a text is crucial for the benefits of the teaching and learning process.
In relation to this, explaining the content of a text was also found to be among the favoured
approaches to teaching literature in the context of this study.

Based on table 4, it is prevalent that those trained in literature were more positive with their
approaches in literature lesson. It is interesting to note that though those trained were more positive
with their approaches, both groups shared similar preferred approach. They agreed that using
simple terminologies in explaining a text is a highly favoured approach in teaching literature. The
trained group in addition also favoured asking student questions, explaining the content of the text
and encouraging students to relate the text to their personal experiences. It also appeared similar
for the non-trained group except for explaining the content of the text approach as they opted for
re-telling the text to help students’ understanding as their second most favoured approach. Both
trained and non-trained teachers also showed that eliciting information from students about the
text, setting language activities and generating language practice using the text are the three least
favoured literature approaches. The significant difference between the two groups is shown in the
following table.

Similarly, an independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the approaches
employed by the respondents who have received literature training and those who have not. There
exists a significant difference in the scores for the teachers with literature training (mean=3.301,
s.d.=.327) and those without literature training (mean=3.117, s.d.=.275); (t=5.022, p=.000).
In comparing between those who have received literature training and those who have not,
it appears that training indirectly prepares the teacher better. This is concurrent with MELTA
(2012), that attending plays and literary events would indirectly add to literature teachers’
experience. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education Malaysia (2013) encourages teachers to attend
courses as trainings enable teachers to constantly develop their skills to the competency level
expected of a teacher. This emphasises the critical need for teachers to arm themselves with the
current and updated knowledge pertaining to teaching and learning which can be acquired through
trainings. In addition, MELTA (2012) reports that due to the lack of training besides not majoring
in literature itself, many English teachers were found to have low confidence in teaching the
component.
Another favoured approach to teaching literature as shown by the respondents of this study
is asking students questions as a means to check their understanding. Questioning approach is vital

as it helps teachers to identify the students’ progress. As disclosed by Rashid, Vethamani and
Rahman (2010), this approach is the avenue for teachers to countercheck students’ learning
process. Furthermore, it assists teachers to be more reflective on their teaching strategies. Students’
responses may serve as indicators on the effectiveness of a lesson. Hwang and Embi (2007) also
reveal that this approach emphasises on the students’ giving responses about a text. Teachers
should make full use of this approach as it is the platform for them to observe the effectiveness of
their teaching. Moreover, the questioning approach is also prevalent in Sidhu, Chan and Kaur
(2010); Suliman and Yunus (2014); Yunus and Suliman (2014).

The third category looks into the teaching experience. Although the middle group (11 – 20
years) seemed to have higher mean score as compared to the other two groups, the choice of the
most preferred approach between the groups differed. For the first group (1 – 10 years), the most
favored approach was asking students questions whereas the other two groups (11 – 20 years and
21 years and more) were in favour of using simple terminologies to explain a text. This resembles
the findings from the other categories earlier. Then, the 1 – 10 years group also obtained a high
mean score for the following approaches – using simple terminologies and explaining the content
approach besides re-telling the text to help students’ understanding. The second group, however,
opted for explaining the content of the text and encouraging students to relate the text to their
personal experiences as their preferred approaches. The most senior group (21 years and more)
were more inclined to encourage students to relate the text to their own experiences, encourage
students to express feelings towards the issues in the text, ask students questions and guide students
to express opinions towards the text. On the contrary, as elucidated from the earlier findings, all

three categories of teachers agreed that eliciting information from students about the text, setting
language activities and generating language practice using the text were the three least favoured
approaches to teaching literature. The table describes the difference between teaching experience
and the approaches employed.

The table above shows the relationship between teaching experience and approaches
employed. However, the result revealed no significant difference between the three groups. This
is shown via sig = 0.207 (p > 0.05) and F value (2, 268) = 1.583. Thus, it is indicated that there
was no significant difference between teaching experience and approaches employed.
As reflected in the ANOVA result, there was no significant difference between the three
groups of teaching experience. This reflects the finding by Sii Ling and Chen (2016) that years of
teaching was not an influencing factor in deciding the teaching approaches to be employed. On the
other hand, this finding refuted what have been claimed by Unal and Unal (2012) and Abbas and
Niloofar (2012) regarding the difference between the experienced and novice teachers. The
majority of the respondents revealed that the least favoured approach to teaching literature was
eliciting information from students about the text. This may indicate that teachers still employ
teacher-centred approaches. This reflects the finding by Carter and Long (1991) that literature is
teacher-centred in which they pass knowledge and information to the students. In fact, this finding
is similar to those in previous studies (Hwang & Embi, 2007; Suliman & Yunus; 2014).
The other two least preferred approaches are setting language activities and generating
language practices. It is surprising to note that language activities are not highly favoured by the
respondents of this study though Novianti (2016) affirms that the study of language has been
inseparable from the study of literature. Irrefutably, literature is associated to language and one
cannot discard the influence of language learning in literature. However, the respondents in this
study might agree to Padurean (2015) who proposed that English literature should be approached
differently because the language used is too complicated. Hence, they might believe that language
learning should be excluded from literature leading them to employ less language-based
approaches in the lesson. This may be misleading because Carter and Long (1991) emphasise that
literature is able to enrich the cultural knowledge of students, which is an integral part in language
learning. Thus, literature has a connection to language learning, and it is essential in understanding
any literature lesson.

The Influence of Locality, Training and Teaching Experience

Conclusion
The results have revealed two fundamental findings of the study. First, the respondents of this
study were more inclined to use simple terminologies in giving explanation about a literary text
taught as compared to getting students eliciting information about the text. This emphasizes the
reliance on teacher-centeredness as compared to focusing on students-centeredness. Secondly, in
examining the significant difference among teachers with regard to locality, training and teaching
experience, only two variables indicated significant difference. Teaching experience did not
disclose any significant difference though the middle group (11 to 20 years of teaching experience)
had the highest mean score. In addition, the rural area teachers and those who have received
literature training were found to be more receptive of their approaches to teaching literature.
This study has suggested that teachers teaching literature need to vary their approaches in
order to arouse students’ interest towards a lesson. There are various approaches to teaching
literature that can be employed by teachers. Lively approach such as conducting performance
activities may also be employed to cater to students who are interested in arts performance.
Regardless of locality, training and teaching experience, teachers should be more optimistic and
dare to take risks in employing different kinds of approaches in teaching literature since relying
on one approach may not better the teaching and learning process. Future research may look into
areas such as activities conducted in the literature lesson besides teachers’ attitudes towards
literature and their relationship with locality, training and teaching experience. Furthermore, future
studies may also look into students’ perspectives and how they perceive literature lesson based on
locality, gender and types of school.
All in all, this study has shown that locality, training and teaching experience had impacts
on the selection of approaches to teaching literature. This may affect the process of teaching and
learning literature. Teachers have a crucial role in the teaching and learning process. Teachers are
the centre of an educational journey and play a crucial role in engaging students in the learning
process (Suliman, Nor & Yunus, 2017). Teachers are welcome to attend any courses and training
to update themselves with current approaches and methodologies pertaining to literature teaching.
This is even reinforced by the Ministry of Education Malaysia (2013), stating that ever since
teachers enter the pre-service training, they will be given the best training possible up to the point
of their retirement. Hence, this highlights the needs for teachers to always keep abreast with the
relevant knowledge and skills in order to uphold the quality of the education system.
