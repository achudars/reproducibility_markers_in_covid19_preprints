Analyzing Measles Vaccine Coverage in the
United States

Introduction

Ever since Wakefield released his fraudulent paper, vaccine misinformation has
been causing trouble for efforts to ensure significant vaccination coverage. The
WHO even lists vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten health concerns[5].
Measles cases in the United States are on the rise[4]. One of the primary causes,
according to some of the medical community is the antivax movement[2]. However, insufficient analysis exists to make this claim. This short paper, which is
part of the Improving Epidemiological Research project, looks at state and HHS
region level data and seeks to identify whether coverage really has changed[3].
Answers to a number of questions were sought, in order to gain better insight
into the matter.
1. Was there a downward change in the overall?
2. Was there a downward change in the minimum per state and per region
coverage?
3. Was there an increase in the the variance of immunization rates between
states and between regions?

Method

MMR vaccination coverage spanning the years 1995 - 2017, separated by state
and HHS region, among children 19-35 months old was obtained from the
CDC[1]. Data from Washington DC was also included. First, nation wide
vaccination rates were investigated. Next, minimum vaccination rates, as well
as standard deviation for each year were calculated, both by state and by region.
While more complicated statistical methods are available, this paper is just an
initial step to suggest the need for additional research, so linear regression was
used. The slope, coefficient of determination, and 95% confidence intervals for
slopes of each category were calculated.

Discussion

There were a number of limitations with this analysis. First, the data only
considered those who had received at least one dose. However, because the
overall claim being tested was that vaccine hesitancy is resulting in an increase in
cases, it would be somewhat unusual for these results to hold. It does not make
sense that a vaccine hesitant parent would accept one dose but not additional
doses. Another limitation is that the highest resolution of data was state level
data. County data might provide additional information.
However, based on the data analysis conducted so far, there is reason to be
concerned about premature assignment of blame. We are seeing a positive trend
in minimum vaccination rates, as well as a smoothing of vaccination coverage.
While county wide pockets may very well be forming, coverage at the state
and regional levels are becoming increasingly even. This result is somewhat
puzzling, considering the increasing sentiment regarding vaccine hesitancy. One
possibility is that this analysis is simply not properly capturing the impact
on vaccination rates. In all four analyses, the 95% confidence interval for the
slope passed through 0. Another option is that while people may be becoming
increasingly vocal, and in some small areas may be refusing to vaccinate, the
rhetoric may not be translating into action.
In order to get a better picture, county level data is going to be needed. It
may also be useful to perform a non-linear analysis, and possibly a graphical
analysis on the data. The goal would be to look for the emergence of clusters
that could be acting as a source of infection for the general population.
