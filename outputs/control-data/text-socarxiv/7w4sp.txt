Abstract
Motivation is a primary determinant of a student’s academic success, but in many underresourced educational contexts around the world, opportunities to develop motivation are
lacking. In the City of God neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we (a group of scientists and
science educators) enacted brief, interactive interventions targeting teenage students at risk of
dropping out of school. Students participated in an immersive 5-day program, followed by a sixmonth break, before completing the second, 3-day program. Participants learned how to use the
scientific method in real-world settings to generate new knowledge. In order to consolidate these
knowledge gains and bolster the program’s inspirational power, capstone projects empowered
participants to speak with NASA mission managers and, in some cases, acquire never-beforeseen images of Mars. While longitudinal study and a more robust sample size are required to
bolster conclusions about the efficacy of our approach, initial results suggest that Ad Astra
programs significantly enhance self-efficacy and science-oriented career ambitions.

Among the factors that are positively correlated with academic success, motivation is
paramount: with an intrinsic desire to learn, students are better positioned to overcome obstacles
and make the most of available opportunities [1]. Anecdotal evidence among practicing scientists
suggests that specific, punctuated events during childhood can spark academic interest and
sustain motivation [2]. The Ad Astra Academy aims to develop such experiences for students in
under-resourced educational contexts in order to inspire them to pursue further education, even
in the face of structural obstacles. As an organization led by scientists, it also measures the
results of its activities and analyzes the degree to which focused interventions can have
behavioral, academic, and career-based effects on participants. Astronomy and astrobiology
represent compelling subject matter for these efforts because of the sense of wonder, awe,
inspiration, and other positive emotions that they can instill, especially among youth, and also
due to the wide-reaching, universal questions they engage [3]. By presenting scientific content in
the framework of exploration and discovery, Ad Astra Academy programs incorporate principles
of active learning and team-based projects, placing the student at the center of the learning
process and encouraging autonomous learning, thereby providing the opportunity to display
resilience, competence, and cooperation [4].

Some factors that contribute to student motivation are relatively well-established. Past
work has demonstrated the importance of competence, autonomy, and relatedness through the
framework of self-determination theory [5], revealing the benefits of metacognition to keep track
of progress [6] and highlighting the value of a growth mindset in building resilience and
sustained academic interest [7]. Similarly, the expectancy-value theory [8] has shown that
students' achievement on a task depends on the subjective value that students assign to it, and
whether they expect to succeed.

Most of these and other studies on motivation focus on structural or attitudinal factors;
we seek to analyze how factors such as brevity and intensity of an intervention can lead to longlasting motivational changes. Simply put: can a brief, dramatic experience substantially change
the nature of a student’s motivation, and thereby positively influence their career trajectory?
Further, how does a student’s socioeconomic status affect the potential impact of the
intervention, and how might this differ in under-resourced communities? To what extent do the
external pressures of poverty, scarcity, and violence modulate the student’s response to this
intervention? Several authors point to a class of brief interventions that have a long-lasting effect
months and even years after they end [9,10]. Most of these studies emphasize that long-term
effects were detected, but we aim to explore the factors that make this possible.

In this study, we present qualitative and exploratory quantitative results from Ad Astra
Academy programs that spanned four years in the City of God neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. Our intervention aligned with self-determination theory which specifies the importance of
autonomy, competence and relatedness [5]. To support student autonomy, we incorporated selfdirected learning and viewed learners as active constructors of their knowledge. To bolster
relatedness, local scientists spoke about their discoveries, and shared how science can work in
concert with community goals and values. We believe that by seeing the value and outcomes of
the scientific method, students may increase their intrinsic motivation and find value in learning
about locally relevant content. Finally, to support competence, we engaged deeply with content
knowledge and procedural knowledge of the scientific method. In all programs, the international

45
46

Ad Astra team partnered with Brazilian scientists, educators, and institutions to foster effective
communication and feature more relatable role models for participating students.

In 2015, eight days of intensive instruction were provided in two segments over the
course of six months. The first week (five days) integrated classroom-based lectures and
interactive exercises centered on the scientific method as well as a full-day field trip to put the
lessons into practice and take learning out of the classroom. The curriculum built up to a
Capstone Project in which the Brazilian students spoke with the NASA Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter (MRO) High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) instrument team in
Arizona via videoconference to request high-resolution images of Mars based on a wellsupported scientific rationale. Six months later, after the images were acquired, the second
instructional session (lasting three days) allowed students to interpret the new Mars-scapes and
design a simulated mission to explore the area with a focus on habitability and astrobiology.

In 2018, an Ad Astra Academy team returned to Brazil and organized a one-week
program with a new cohort of students. The curriculum used a structure similar to the 2015
intervention, incorporating key elements of the scientific method, a field trip, and a Capstone
Project. Rather than acquire new satellite images of Mars, student teams spoke via
videoconference with Mars Science Laboratory rover mission team members at NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California to propose rover traverses and pursue scientific aims.

We hypothesized that by participating on the front lines of space exploration and
revealing parts of the Solar System never before seen at high resolution, students from underresourced communities who would otherwise not have such an opportunity, would enjoy the
learning process, build a stronger sense of empowerment and self-efficacy, and be inspired to
pursue higher education. By boosting intrinsic motivation, we proposed that students would be
well-positioned to overcome the significant external obstacles that preclude further educational
and employment opportunities.

The Ad Astra Academy set out to improve the academic experiences of disadvantaged
youth through an alternative approach to learning through exploration. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
the ‘favelas’ are neighborhoods with high concentrations of people living in poverty, with high
levels of criminal activity and limited professional opportunities for young people. Studies have
shown that every additional year of education results in a 10% increase in wages, making
education one of the most powerful drivers of economic success [11]. However, the unbalanced
education system in Brazil means that the poor have few prospects for social mobility, and
children growing up in favelas are at a significant disadvantage. Admission rates to the best
universities are extremely low, and enrollment is determined by a selection exam that privileges
well-resourced students. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),
in 2014 the government calculated that 40% of the students in the top-ranked federal public
universities were from the richest quintile of the population, while the poorest quintile
represented around 7% of enrollment [12]. While the situation has improved significantly (from
60% and 2%, respectively, in 2004), the conclusion is unavoidable: students from underresourced communities face major barriers in their pursuit of higher education and social
mobility.

87

In Rio de Janeiro alone, two million favela residents (which accounts for nearly one-third
of the city’s population) are virtually excluded from university-level education. Data from IBGE
show that educational trajectories are largely established in secondary school: 30% of 15 to 17year-olds in the poorest quintile of the population have abandoned school. In contrast, the
dropout rate among the richest quintile in the same age range is only 5% [12].

Social challenges compound the problem. As university and job prospects become
unrealized dreams in the favela, other forces take hold. According to 2018 data from the World
Health Organization, Brazil had one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in the world (60.8
births per 1000 girls, which was more than six times higher than the rate for high-income
countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) [13].
For boys, the timing of school dropouts coincides with recruitment into drug-related gangs,
which target teenagers. According to 2015 Brazilian government statistics, of all arrests made
nationwide in Brazil, 18% were of boys under the age of 18, and 41% of these arrests were due
to drug-trafficking activities [14].

In short, there are enormous obstacles to professional success for children growing up in
the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, and we hypothesize that a strong sense of intrinsic motivation
instilled through a brief but exciting intervention could provide positive momentum to help
students overcome the circumstances they were born into. In the two programs run in 2015 and
2018, Ad Astra Academy sought to engage students right before the critical age of adolescence
when Brazilian teenagers in the City of God are most likely to abandon their education. We
partnered with the Instituto Presbiteriano Álvaro Reis (INPAR), a 100-year-old institution that
facilitates extra-curricular activities for the youth of the City of God favela. The Ad Astra team
also coordinated activities for student participants with the Museum of Astronomy, the City
Planetarium, the Museum of Life, and the Valongo Observatory at the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro (UFRJ).

In collaboration with coordinators at INPAR, we selected cohorts of 20 students between
the ages of 12-16 to participate in the 2015 and 2018 programs. Initial school-directed selections
consisted of the top-performing students (80% female, 20% male); in this context, the program
was presented as a reward for good academic performance. However, in order to fulfill our
central aim of engaging students for whom the traditional school system was not working,
classes were adjusted to add several boys who were less academically engaged. This shift
resulted in a 50%-50% male to female ratio. Both cohorts consisted of heterogeneous groups
covering a spectrum of academic interest and susceptibility to dropping out of school. By
diversifying the sampling parameters, the academies were designed to provide a springboard of
positive reinforcement for curious students who lacked engaging academic experiences, and also
to show students on less productive paths that learning could be an exciting activity with longterm benefits at a key inflection point in their lives.

Program 1: 2015.
The inaugural Ad Astra Academy program in 2015 consisted of two separate sessions: 5
days in June and 3 days in November. Prior to the start of any programmatic activities, students
were given a pre-test (see “Outcomes” section below), administered by INPAR staff, to be
compared with post-program tests. In preparation for the first visit from the international team,

130
131
132
133

INPAR took the students on visits to the Museum of Astronomy and to the City Planetarium,
both in Rio de Janeiro. These initial activities primed the students for the start of the curriculum
with fundamental knowledge of space-related subject matter and a building sense of excitement
for “school not-as-usual.”

Two week-long visits from the international team were separated by six months (a
summary of daily activities, learning objectives, and relation to Bloom’s Taxonomy of cognition
can be found in Supplementary Table 1.). During the first session, the goal was to introduce the
students to the process of scientific investigation, to ensure they had an adequate knowledge base
to perform the Capstone Project, and to engage the students with the excitement of exploration.
This was achieved through a combination of hands-on-activities, a field trip, and a few lecturestyle presentations.

On the first day, following an introduction to the team, students learned to enact the
scientific method through an interactive exercise. They were asked to make a prediction
(hypothesis) about which of their senses would activate the fastest response to a stimulus. Pairs
of students conducted an experiment by dropping a ruler in response to sight-, sound-, or touchbased cues, and analyzed the quantitative data to test their initial hypotheses. This activity served
as an engaging ice-breaker and also allowed students and instructors to get used to teaching
through an interpreter (as three of the four international team members did not speak
Portuguese). Following this initial experiment, one of the local team members gave an overview
of scientists from Brazil who had made significant contributions, showing the students how
members of their own community have contributed to important scientific discoveries, thereby
making the idea of becoming a scientist more accessible [15].

The field trip was held on the second day. By positioning this experience early in the
week, we anticipated positive out-of-classroom team building effects that would be sustained for
the rest of the program. The field trip during the first session was to the Jaguanum Island -- a
3km2 island off the Green Coast of Rio de Janeiro, about two hours from the school -- which
included a trip on a chartered “pirate ship.” During the trip, students collected samples, operated
an underwater robot, and categorized the requirements for life, gaining an introduction to fieldbased science and analysis. The following day, we connected discussions of habitability and life
across wide spatial scales, using microscopes and satellite imagery. By retracing our field trip via
Google Earth, we aimed to give the students an idea of how to interpret images from orbit, as
they had already been to the place.

With an understanding of how direct, field-based science can be done and how it relates
to remote sensing, the final two days of the first week challenged participants to apply their
critical thinking to planetary targets. After studying images of Mars, students used household
items (e.g., flour, cocoa powder, water, and sand) to re-create Martian landforms and relate
formation mechanisms to habitability and the requirements for life. By building a scale model of
the Solar System, participants performed quantitative analysis and gained a more tangible sense
of the enormous spatial scales of outer space. This exercise in particular helped to highlight the
magnitude and perceived importance of their role in the Capstone Project, in which teams of
students identified sites on Mars for high-resolution imaging. Using all they had learned about
habitability and geomorphology thus far, student teams provided three scientifically supported
reasons to justify their requests. In a live video call with HiRISE mission control, students made
their case that the proposed images would provide helpful new information about Mars’ past or

174
175
176

present conditions. Speaking with a NASA team member by videoconference was stressful for
the students, but many expressed pride in their ability to defend their requests and enthusiasm for
the subsequent projects following the call.

Between the first and second visits of the international team, the local team made weekly
presentations to the students at INPAR on different topics in astronomy. This series helped not
only improve the students’ science background, but also strengthen their connection with the
local team. As this comfort level deepened, students who did not feel comfortable asking
questions at the beginning of the program started participating more. These events were essential
to keep the students engaged and motivated to continue the program during the next international
team visit.

On the second visit, in November 2015, the team reconnected with the students, and, on
the first day, ceremoniously revealed large-format posters of the student-requested HiRISE
images. (Three of the six requested images were acquired, thanks to the invaluable support of the
HiRISE team.) Teams identified features of interest, and explored their formation mechanisms
by developing customized experiments. On the second day, the students went on a full-day field
trip to the Tijuca Forest, the largest urban forest in the world. There, two stations connected
themes of habitability, landscape formation processes, and HiRISE images of Mars. At a small
stream, various methods of testing water flow rates and erosive power were deployed. By
allowing students to pursue experimental approaches that did not work before those that did, we
hoped to convey the challenges of scientific research, as well as the satisfaction that comes with
solving problems. In a large cave in the forest, the students were guided in a discussion of the
challenges of light-independent life forms, and had the opportunity to immerse themselves in a
distinct geological formation. Some students crawled through narrow passages, surprising
themselves and each other with their sense of adventure.

On the program’s final day, student teams used their HiRISE images as a platform for a
mock Mars rover mission. Students took turns as “mission manager”, proposing sites to
investigate and types of data to collect. This exercise, which required teamwork skills of
negotiation, debate, and well-supported justification, reflected many of the challenges of realworld projects. By requiring a consensus for each round of exploration and ensuring that each
student had a turn at the helm, interpersonal dynamics were surprisingly cooperative. At the
program’s conclusion, students completed a post-test - identical to the pre-test - to enable
program evaluation.

Due to time constraints and budget optimization efforts, the second program was
conducted over a single week, allowing us to test a different Capstone Project. The first three
days of the curriculum were identical to that of the 2015 program (see Supplementary Table 1),
building familiarity with the scientific method, highlighting the joy of exploratory field
observation, and connecting observations across wide spatial scales using microscopes and
satellite imagery.

216

The Capstone Project, which occupied days 4 and 5, centered around the use of real Mars
rover mission data to plan scientific investigations of a Martian crater’s habitability and ancient
environmental conditions. Rather than generate primary data themselves (as had been done via
HiRISE image acquisition in 2015), students analyzed real Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)

217
218
219
220
221

images and developed science plans based on well-supported hypotheses. They built small model
rovers to understand fundamental engineering and design principles (Fig. 1), and ultimately
pitched their rover traverse plans via videoconference with MSL team members (Fig. 2).
Unfortunately, due to logistical difficulties, pre- and post-tests were not administered for the
2018 program.

The strategically designed curricula presented above and in Supplementary Table 1 offer
a path for students to gain fluency in performing scientific investigations and learn a great deal
about habitability, astrobiology, and Mars. However, we believe that confidencebuilding, attitude-based outcomes are equally important for student success. In this spirit, we
focused on the key features that make Ad Astra Academy unique throughout both programs: a
passion for learning through experience and exploration, empowerment through inquiry and
resilience, and promotion of curiosity and critical thinking. In practice, these goals translated into
a few actionable guideposts for all instructors:

1. Consistently remind / encourage students to write or sketch observations in lab
notebooks.
2. Encourage students to ask questions at all times, through any mode possible (e.g.,
verbally, or by written submissions, etc.)
3. Lead students along paths of inquiry. If a student’s question can be tested, ask
guiding questions that direct them to formulate experiments. Prioritize the
enactment of these experiments over standard curriculum activities when possible
and appropriate.
4. Convey the range of emotions that come with being a scientist, from the
challenges of failed experiments to the joy of solving a hard problem and
contributing new knowledge to the world.

258

In the 2015 program, we evaluated outcomes by administering pre- and post-tests (see
Supplementary File 1), which focused on measuring competence, autonomy, and relatedness
[5,16]. In order to address competence, we measured student knowledge of the scientific method
and domain-specific information (e.g., habitability, astrobiology, and Mars) before and after
participation in the intervention. To address autonomy and relatedness, we measured students'
perceptions of science in their community and their perceptions of using and creating scientific
knowledge in their community. Assessments of these areas for 17 participants in the 2015
program are summarized in the sections below.

259

267

Competence I: Scientific Method. We summed the number of correct responses of
Questions 1 through 9 on the pre-test and post-test, creating a single score which ranged from 0
to 9 with higher scores indicating more correct answers. Results of a paired samples t-test
indicated that students had significantly higher scores on the scientific method related questions
at post-test (M=7.06, SD=1.06) compared to pre-test (M=4.25, SD=1.12) t (15) = -9.63, p <.001.
Students began the study unsure of what experimental control, data, and a hypothesis were with
correct response rates below 24%. Post-test scores showed that students made gains in all areas,
although understanding what a hypothesis is proved difficult for students both before (47%
correct) and after (41% correct) the program.

268
269
270
271
272

Additionally, we coded student responses to short-answer questions about what the
scientific method is, how it could be used to study a local phenomenon, and how one might
redesign an experiment to more accurately address a target question (questions 10-12). Answers
were coded by two researchers for keywords identified by a domain expert with inter-rater
agreement above 90%. While students incorporated more keywords in their responses at post

273
274
275

compared to pre, the only significant difference emerged for redesign of an experiment (p=.005).
At pre-test, student responses averaged less than one scientific keyword (M=.43) whereas posttest responses averaged more than one keyword (M=1.2).

Competence II: Mars. We summed the number of correct responses for questions 13-15
creating a sum score ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more correct answers
about Mars. Overall students answered significantly more questions correctly at post (M=1.87)
compared to pre (M=.68) t (15) = -7.25, p <.001. Students’ understanding of what a habitat needs
to sustain life (question 17) benefitted from the intervention. At pre only 5% of students correctly
answered this question, whereas 71% answered correctly at post. This is reinforced by shortanswer responses to the question, “what would a human need to survive on Mars” (question 19)
which indicated a significant difference (p<.001) in scientific arguments from pre (M=1.31) to
post (M=2.44). While students exhibited knowledge gains about Mars overall, they struggled on
two questions pertaining to environmental conditions. Explaining the planet’s red color (question
15) proved difficult at pre-test (24% correct) and post-test (29% correct). The short-answer
question about evidence of water on Mars (question 16), while increasing significantly (p=.04)
from pre (M=0.5) to post (M=1.4) is a subject with which students continued to struggle.
Overall, despite difficulty with specific content, students increased their knowledge of Mars and
also provided more well-reasoned arguments that life beyond Earth may be possible (question
21) after the program (M=1.12) compared to before (M=.33, p=.028).

Autonomy and Relatedness: We were also interested in how students perceived the role
of science for themselves and their community. We created a measure from the 11 questions
asking students to reflect on their role in conducting science and their role in producing scientific
knowledge (questions 22-32). Three of the items were reverse coded so that the direction of all
effects could be viewed positively. This resulted in a measure with a minimum of 1 indicating
strong disagreement, and 6 indicating strong agreement. Overall, the results indicated a
significant increase in students’ perceptions of their ability to contribute to scientific knowledge
and the ability of science to solve problems from pre-test (M=3.68) to post-test (M=5.46) t(10)=
-3.72, p=.004. The average pre-test responses belie the fact that five of the eleven items were
below the midpoint of the scale, indicating that students disagreed with statements including, “I
am a scientist”, “Science can solve any problem” and “In the future, I want to be a scientist”, all
of which were significantly (p values <.03) above the midpoint after completing the program.

Additionally, an intriguing pattern emerged for the relationship between the role of self in
science and the role of science in one’s community. While students’ belief in their ability to
carry out their own experiments and to use science to help their community increased (from 3.5
to 5.338 and 4.19 to 5.38, p<.009, respectively), students actually decreased, although not
significantly (p=.18) in the belief that their community uses science to solve problems (pre=
2.81) compared to post (M=2.31). One possible explanation of this decrease is that after gaining
first-hand experience of the rigor and limitations of the scientific method, students’ confidence in
their community’s problem-solving science decreased. However, the validity and implications of
this potential link require further targeted study.

Student Experiences: Developing a quantitative understanding of how the intervention
may have changed participants’ educational paths and career prospects will require several
additional years of longitudinal tracking. Nonetheless, individual testimonials and progression
through academic milestones suggest that, for a subset of participants, the program was a

317
318
319
320

transformative event. Several students said that the experience revealed novel ways of viewing
and interacting with the natural world. “[The program] changed my way of thinking,” one
participant - who declared her newfound desire to be an astronomer - explained. “Now, when I
walk in the street, I look at the sky.” The same student also said that she always liked “the stars
and the planets”, but she did not know that “something like this could be a profession!”.

322
323
324
325

Two of the particularly “at-risk” students noticed a shift in their mindsets toward more
active inquiry and enhanced personal agency. “I did not realize that when I'm on a beach, that I
can pick things up, collect data, and learn more,” said one. Another noted that “the project made
me think more like this: look at the world around me, and ask several questions.”

Another participant is studying for college entrance exams and hopes to pursue a STEM
career. She pointed to the Capstone Project as a key motivator, and the overall experience as a
memory she would call upon during future struggles. “We took a picture of Mars that no one
ever saw or understood,” she explained, “and we will be the first people to see it, and I feel a bit
special...this project is very important to me, I will never forget this week.” This student also
benefited from the team’s gender diversity: “I was even more motivated because I had a certain
fear of being the only woman among the biologists and such, but when I saw other scientists who
were women, it encouraged me.”

335

337

Most striking across the post-program interviews was the power of new physical
experiences to shift students’ mindsets. From riding on a boat for the first time, to seeing a
jellyfish, observing plankton under a microscope, controlling an underwater robot, and seeing
Saturn through a telescope, the density of new experiences created a sense of novelty and
excitement that is now associated with curiosity, learning, and empowerment.

Spacecraft Images: Based on student requests and scientific reasoning, four highresolution images were acquired by the HiRISE team (Fig. 3). In Kasei Valles, dark slope streaks
were observed along channel walls, indicating relatively recent wet or dry flows. At the North
Polar Layered Deposits, distinct mixtures of ice and soil form meter- to decameter-scale layers,
offering clues to past climatic regimes. A mid-latitude rampart crater was surrounded by broad,
rounded shapes, suggesting that the impact may have melted subsurface ice and led to fastflowing fluidized ejecta. On the northern flank of the Pavonis Mons volcano, three distinct rock
outcrops punctuate otherwise flat terrain, whose dunes could help inform atmospheric
circulation.

349
350
351
352

These images would not have been acquired without the partnership between the Ad
Astra Academy’s student explorers and the HiRISE mission’s education and outreach team. We
anticipate that the images will be incorporated by the broader research community into existing
and future studies, ensuring a substantive student contribution to Mars exploration.

Scholarships: To further the impact of the 2018 program, we selected two students, aged
16 and 17, for scholarships in partnership with the Museum of Life, in Rio de Janeiro. The
students go to the Museum twice a week, participating in their experimental and educational
activities. They receive remuneration commensurable with the minimum wage in Brazil. The
intent of providing a paid opportunity is to retain them in science and pursuing college by
alleviating the financial pressure that would make them pursue a non-academic minimum wage
job with little intellectual stimulation.

5. Discussion and Future Work

366
367
368

The exploratory quantitative analyses and anecdotal data presented above point to
significant positive changes in competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as well as more
substantial effects on certain students’ career objectives and world views.

369
370
371
372
373

Several challenges - both anticipated and unforeseen - complicated the program’s
implementation and may have prevented educational gains from reaching their full potential. As
expected given the inclusion of students with poor attendance and behavior records, disruptive
behavior was occasionally distracting. Teaching via translators was a slow process that, at times,
limited information transfer and precluded deeper connections between international instructors

374
375
376
377

and students. Teacher training efforts were limited to an information-sharing session and did not
allow Ad Astra educators to observe local teachers’ incorporation of key programmatic elements
(e.g., active learning, student-directed inquiry, exploration of the natural world) into subsequent
classroom activities.

Given our analysis of the pre- and post-tests, interviews with students, teachers, and
family members, and Ad Astra team member reflections, future programs will prioritize several
additions / modifications. The telescope night event was an encouraging sign of community
interest; enhancing this component by providing students with a platform to share their new
knowledge and show the confidence they have attained will build longer-term buy-in from
potentially skeptical family members or community leaders. While we hope Ad Astra Academy
programs instill a long-lasting passion for learning in the students themselves, engagement from
students’ families is a critical piece of the puzzle. Family member interviews revealed that
caregivers almost universally see higher education as a worthy pursuit, but in the face of
challenging economic circumstances, income-generating activities take priority. We anticipate
that involving caregivers in the student’s journey of discovery and curiosity - in addition to the
scholarships Ad Astra offers - will lead to a stronger commitment to the long-term benefits of
education.

One of the most effective ways to consolidate knowledge gains and develop a deeper
understanding of relevant principles is through project-based activities [17]. Our curriculum
included several short-term projects, but students would likely benefit from more sustained and
self-directed efforts. For example, developing a research agenda to follow up on questions that
arose during the week would nurture a seed of interest. With the tools of the scientific method at
their disposal, motivated students would be well positioned to expand their knowledge base.

397
398
399
400
401
402

Other tweaks to the program will help align our efforts with published best practices. For
example, by highlighting the struggles of the international scientists, we can remove the stigma
of uncertainty, eliminate the misconception of “innate talent,” and facilitate a growth mindset
[18]. Asking students to reflect on daily activities and the program’s broader lessons in a more
private, personal context (e.g., through journaling) will help participants gain ownership of the
material and tailor it to their specific circumstances [6,15].

Modifications to our team composition and classroom approach would ease language
barrier issues and make the best use of limited time. In both iterations of the Brazil academies,
the international team consisted exclusively of scientists; involving trained educators (as has
occurred at other Ad Astra Academies around the world) would be helpful in building cohesion
and limiting disruptions through classroom management and team-building exercises. Working
with translator scientists was an essential yet surprisingly effective part of the process. At their
best, scientist translators understood the learning objectives of a given activity and guided groups
of students down the path of discovery. This independence saved time by avoiding word-forword translation and improved knowledge delivery by incorporating culturally relevant
references. To enhance these effects, future programs will involve local scientists from an earlier
stage of curriculum development to ensure all instructors buy in to the program’s underlying
objectives and understand the curriculum’s progression to attain them.

415
416
417

Local scientists provided a bridge not only in terms of language, but also in relatability:
students could “see themselves” more easily in the local scientists than in the international team
members. Given the strong effects of representation in building self-efficacy [19], bolstering this

component by involving role models as close to the students’ cultural, social, and economic
circumstances as possible is a priority. Nonetheless, we also found that including international
scientists provided some unexpected benefits. The range of domain-specific expertise
encompassed by the team meant that a broad set of student questions could be answered.
Instructors’ deep knowledge of experimental design allowed them to quickly arrange
demonstrations or experiments to address questions and provide positive reinforcement to
curious students. In addition, the “eventized” nature of incorporating international scientists
made students feel valued, special, and part of something important. In the 2015 iteration, several
participants expressed skepticism that the team would in fact return after the first week of
instruction, or that HiRISE images would be acquired. Demonstrating that scientists from outside
the City of God - a traditionally marginalized community - care about students’ difficulties and
aspirations may provide an emotional boost as important as the intellectual one [20].

In order to scale the core tenets of Ad Astra Academy’s pedagogical approach experiential, inquiry-based learning through the lens of exploration - disseminating these
principles through local teachers is essential. After all, teachers have more sustained contact with
students and their families, and are better positioned to tailor instructional approaches to an
individual pupil’s interests and life circumstances. A more extensive teacher training program
that allows time for practice and feedback for both Ad Astra educators and local teachers would
be a productive next step.

437
438
439

441
442

Many of our future course corrections seek to build a culture of knowledge and
exploration around Ad Astra Academy students. Our initial evidence suggests that, for many
participants, the spark of inspiration caught hold, but it needs fuel - in the form of family support,
longer-term projects that reinforce key principles, and classroom environments that promote
student inquiry - to continue burning. While developing a full infrastructure of support is beyond
the scope of our program, the relatively straightforward modifications highlighted above will
help capitalize on the knowledge, attitude, and behavior gains students attain from the
punctuated Ad Astra Academy experience.

Ad Astra Academy programs in Brazil have sought to instill a passion for knowledge and
exploration in under-resourced communities among students with limited educational and
economic opportunities. Through brief, interactive interventions designed to empower students
to contribute to the leading edge of space exploration, many students reported transformational
impacts. Analysis of pre- and post-tests indicated that participants expressed a markedly
enhanced ability and desire to engage in scientific research following the program. Substantial
methodological challenges for the study remain, including the collection of long-term data to
evaluate the program’s impact on career success. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the initial
results presented here, which support our hypothesis that brief, impactful interventions can play a
positive role in a student’s educational trajectory through enhanced autonomy and selfefficacy.
