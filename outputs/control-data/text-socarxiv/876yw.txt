Abstract Prior work has highlighted increases in life expectancy in the United States during the Great Depression. This contradicts the tenet that life expectancy is positively correlated with human welfare, but it coheres with recent literature on mortality and recessions.
We construct Lee-Carter interval estimates of life expectancy during the Great Depression,
based on trends before 1929. In this analysis, all-race life expectancy did not grow unusually
during the Great Depression. However, nonwhites did see greater-than-expected increases
in life expectancy in 1930–33. We discuss potential explanations. We conclude by urging
scholars of mortality during this time period to focus on race whenever the data permit it.

Introduction
During the Great Depression (1930–33), both infant and non-infant death rates declined in
the United States (Fishback et al, 2007), and life expectancy increased (Tapia Granados and
Diez Roux, 2009). This occurred despite drops in the gross domestic product (GDP) and a
rising unemployment rate. Given that life expectancy is often regarded as a proxy for social
conditions (f.e., Lieberson, 1980; Ewbank, 1987), this is surprising. What is more, it contradicts prior research (albeit for cause-specific mortality), which found a countercyclical relationship between the economy and heart disease death rates during this time period (Brenner,
1971). However, there is increasing evidence for procyclical relation between mortality and
the economy (f.e., Ruhm 2000; Angelini and Mierau 2014; Haaland and Telle 2015; Ruhm
2015; Sameem and Sylwester 2017; Tapia Granados and Ionides 2017; van den Berg et al
2017). Our goal is to refine our understanding of mortality change specifically during the
Great Depression, the largest recession in the United States since 1900.
Scholars have advanced several explanations for gains in life expectancy during economic downturns such as the Great Depression. First, the “income effect” explanation assumes that a fall in family income reduces consumption of health-damaging goods (f.e.,
alcohol, Khan et al 2002). Second, the “hazards” explanation predicts, following elevated
unemployment, fewer traffic-related and work-related accidents as well as reduced exposure
to work-related hazards (Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006). Third, workers who remain employed
during recessions may, out of fear of imminent job loss, reduce behaviors (f.e., alcohol consumption) that place them at risk of appearing deviant or delinquent (Catalano et al, 2002).
Fourth, working-age adults who lose jobs may shift their time use to health-promoting activities for themselves and their family (f.e., exercise, parenting, caregiving for elderly parents, Ruhm 2007). Whereas the “hazards” explanation enjoys the most empirical support in
contemporary societies (Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006), the lack of historical data on health
behaviors in the 1920s and 1930s makes it challenging to assess the relevance of these explanations to the Great Depression case.
Increasing life expectancy is the hallmark of mortality in the twentieth century (Oeppen
and Vaupel, 2002; Vallin and Meslé, 2009; Canudas-Romo, 2010). Were increases in life expectancy, 1930–33, unusual relative to prior trends, or can they be regarded as a continuation
of them? Taking a counterfactual approach, we project (with uncertainty) life expectancy,
1930–40, based on data from 1900–29, using the Lee-Carter model. We then compare the
resulting projection interval to observed life expectancy in the United States. We also disaggregate by sex and race (white/nonwhite) and — because of idiosyncratic compositional
changes in the United States death registration area, 1900–33 — we replicate the analysis
using a balanced panel of states. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first
to use the Lee-Carter approach for this type of historical counterfactual.
The contribution of this study to the literature on mortality response to social change is
that it demographically contextualizes the rises in life expectancy during the Great Depression by taking into account prior trends. Overall, we find that while all-race life expectancy
rose during the Great Depression, the pattern cannot be regarded as unusual relative to the
1900–29 trend. For nonwhites, the increases in life expectancy, 1930–33, were greater (consistent with the point estimates of Tapia Granados and Diez Roux 2009), and exceed the
projection interval based on the 1900–29 trend. Our analysis includes counterfactual projection intervals. We interpret the results as a demographically-important increase in nonwhite
life expectancy during the Great Depression; this is not statistical significance in a strict
sense. We also consider that the Great Migration may have shifted the geography of the
nonwhite population in ways that affected mortality. Our descriptive demographic analysis

raises this hypothesis (migration), but we are unaware of internal migration data from the
United States in this time period which has annual time resolution (not to mention stratification by race). Therefore we are unable to test the migration hypothesis. We strongly
recommend that scholars working on mortality during the Great Depression should stratify
their analyses by race whenever the data permit it.

Data and methods
Before describing our analytic approach in greater detail, we give a temporal definition of
the Great Depression. Assigning a precise start date is a challenge (Eichengreen, 2004). We
use calendar-year mortality data, so we require only calendar-year precision in dating the
Great Depression. Figure 1 presents two key economic indicators, the unemployment rate
and inflation-adjusted gross domestic product per capita, using data from Carter et al (2006).
The unemployment rate rose dramatically in 1930 relative to 1929, and peaked in 1932 (on
the difficulties of measuring unemployment during this period, cf. Darby 1976 and Wallis
1989). In 1933, unemployment was still high but was declining, and by 1934 had steeply
declined. Per-capita GDP reached a then-historic high in 1929 and tumbled in 1930–33; in
1934 it started to rebound. The last “normal” year, so to say, is 1929, while the recovery
starts in 1933. We define the Great Depression as 1930–33, inclusive.
We use national data on mortality rates by age and sex for the United States, 1900–40
(U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1956). These data are the longest series
of pre-Great Depression mortality data available. Appendix I (p.11) gives some descriptive
statistics and time series plots of the input data. United States’ mortality is racially imprinted
(Preston et al, 2003), so it is logical to perform sub-analyses by race. We analyze data for
the total population, as well as for whites and nonwhites separately; the data do not have
more granular information on racial categories, but nonwhite in this period was predominantly black or African-American (Lerner, 1975). All analyses are done separately by sex.

For 1900–32, the data are for the Death Registration Area (DRA), a subset of the country
(see Hetzel 1997, pp.43–66). To test whether compositional changes in the DRA affect our
results, we replicated the analysis using a balanced panel (the death registration states of
1910, using data from Linder and Grove, 1943, table 8). The balanced panel analysis is in
Appendix III (p.19).
We used a Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992) to calculate a range of plausible
life expectancies during the 1930s, based only on information from before 1930. Since their
development twenty-five years ago, Lee-Carter models have enjoyed wide use in demography (Shang et al, 2011; Shang, 2016). Lee-Carter has two parts, estimation and projection.
Using data from 1900–29, we fit the Lee-Carter b and k parameters using singular value
decomposition (Lee, 1992). Using the method of computing the a values recommended by
Lee (2000), the projection is constrained to equal the data in the knot year of 1929 (see also
Bell, 1997). We then used these estimates to project mortality for 1930 through 1940. The
Lee-Carter model as implemented here is described in much greater detail in Appendix II
(p.17).
The Lee-Carter technique is typically used for forecasting (Lee, 2000), so it is worth further describing our application of Lee-Carter to historical data. We ask whether the increase
in life expectancy, 1930–33, was unusual relative to contemporary trends and variations. In
short, we use data from before 1930 to construct a counterfactual near-term (10-year) projection. This provides an estimate of life expectancy in the 1930s based only on information
from before the 1930s. Given that this series exhibits autocorrelation, the Lee-Carter approach is more appropriate than a polynomial extrapolation of the 1900–29 life expectancy
trend. An alternate approach would be ARIMA models, but these require at least 50 observations (years, in this context) to perform well (Box et al, 2008), so are not suited to the
current problem, in which data begin in 1900. The Lee-Carter approach provides a projection interval (not a statistical confidence interval). The null hypothesis is that life expectancy
during the Great Depression was not different from the twentieth century juggernaut of life
expectancy up to 1929. Where the empirical data lie inside the projection interval, we fail
to reject this null. This is not the same as saying life expectancy did not increase (Amrhein
et al, 2017). The 1918 pandemic notwithstanding, life expectancy is a measure that tends
to change slowly. Thus, the question at hand is more suited to variance-based measures —
such as the Lee-Carter projection fan — than to regression discontinuity or similar designs.
The Lee-Carter projection is a random walk with drift of the model’s k parameter (Lee
and Carter, 1992; Li and Lee, 2005), using the 1900–29 mean annual increase as the drift
and the 1900–29 standard deviation. The process is repeated (all our results are based on
1,000,000 runs), generating a distribution of outcomes, from which the 95% projection interval is generated by taking the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. We modified the standard Lee-Carter
approach to assume that the sexes are correlated, as opposed to independent random walks.
That is to say, rather than model km and k f as independent Brownian random walks based
on their variances (Freedman, 1983), we model the deviations as being drawn from a bivariate normal distribution based on the male:female variance-covariance matrix. Since the
projection interval is based on the tail densities, this elaboration is not crucial to the result
(i.e., the projection interval widths). However, it is justified theoretically (Noymer and Van,
2014; Raftery et al, 2014) and is similar to the cointegrated approach discussed by Carter
and Lee (1992) or the Poisson approach of Li (2013).
Mortality was severely affected by an influenza pandemic in 1918, causing a conundrum
for fitting k (Lee, 1992). We chose to omit this year, pretending, so to say, that 1917 is
followed by 1919. The graphs illustrate this by using an alternate line pattern, 1917–19.
Inclusion of 1918 would increase the standard deviation of the fitted k values. This would

result in a wider projection interval, making it harder for the observed life expectancy to
escape the interval. We chose the approach of excluding 1918 to avoid bias toward the null.
Analysis was performed using IDL 8.7 (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Inc., Boulder,
CO).

Results
Our results are principally graphical, shown in figures 2–4. All the graphs have the same
vertical and horizontal scale, allowing like-for-like comparisons. The shaded vertical bands
indicate the Great Depression (1929–33); 1929 is the knot year, in which the projection and
observed data are aligned, and 1933 is the end of the Great Depression. Figure 2 presents
the results for all races. During the Great Depression, life expectancy for either sex rose but
did not escape the 95% projection interval; females are closer to the edge than are males.
Interestingly, after the Great Depression ends (as defined, 1933), life expectancy decreases
and then stabilizes, before starting to rise again in 1937. As a check on our calculations, we
compared our life expectancy numbers to those of the Human Mortality Database (HMD)
(Barbieri et al, 2015), and find excellent agreement.1
Figure 3 shows the same result for whites only. Not surprisingly, given the racial composition of the United States at the time, it is largely the same as figure 2, but the empirical life
expectancy data are slightly closer to the center of the projection fan. The most interesting
findings are for nonwhites, in figure 4: for males, in 1930 the observed life expectancy is
inside but near the edge of the projection interval; this is similar to the finding for whites,
although nonwhites are closer to the boundary of what would be considered a significant deviation from the prior trend. In 1931–33, inclusive, nonwhite males’ life expectancy escapes
1 This is only possible for all races, and only in 1933 and thereafter, per HMD data availability. For 1933–
39, the average difference (across all years and both sexes) between our calculations and those of the HMD
are 0.045 years of life expectancy (maximum difference: 0.093); these are negligible. For 1940, the average
difference (across both sexes) is 0.145 years of life expectancy (maximum difference: 0.153). The reason
for the bigger (but still small) difference is a discrepancy of almost half a million between the population
(exposures) used by Hornseth and Stanback 1954 (which was used to calculate our source of rates, U.S.
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1956), and that of the HMD. The “custom” HMD population
estimates (Andreeva and Barbieri, 2017, p.14) imply population shrinkage of 211,000 between the census
enumeration (1 April 1940), and mid-year 1940, which seems implausible.

the projection interval. Thus, during the Great Depression, nonwhite male life expectancy
not only rose, but rose higher than expected from prior trends. Interestingly, when the worst
of the Depression abated, nonwhite male life expectancy decreased again, and did not surpass its 1933 value until 1938, when it again exceeded the projection interval.
The most remarkable result is that for nonwhite females (figure 4). In 1930, like nonwhite males, life expectancy is at the edge of the projection interval. However, in 1931
and thereafter, nonwhite females’ life expectancy surpasses the projection fan. By 1940,
the female life expectancy was about 2 years above even the upper bound of the projection
interval. Contrast this to white females (figure 3), whose life expectancy was inside the projection interval, or to nonwhite males whose life expectancy in 1940 was about half a year
outside the projection interval.
These findings are reinforced by some descriptive statistics on minima, maxima, and
change (table 1). These data summarize the observed trends, and are split into the same
training/projection period; they are not based on any Lee-Carter projections. The first six
data columns refer to the training data for Lee-Carter (1900–29, excluding 1918). The bottom part of the table pertains to the 1910–29 balanced-panel analysis of Appendix III. Not
surprisingly given the general upward trend, minimum life expectancy occurs in 1900 for all
race/sex combinations. For whites, the maximum life expectancy, 1900–29, occurs in 1927,
close to the end of the training period, as would be expected from the trend. For nonwhites,

the maximum life expectancy occurs in 1922, seven years before the end of the window; this
is in the wake of the 1920–21 recession (see figure 1, and Wicker 1966; Vernon 1991).2
Table 1 also gives the end minus start change in life expectancy (note, this is not the
same as max minus min). The increases in life expectancy during the training period (viz.,
1900–29) were greater for nonwhites (3.96 more years of life expectancy gain for males,
and 3.13 for females, indicated a and b, respectively, in table 1). Bear in mind the much
lower starting points for nonwhites — f.e., life expectancy below 30 years for nonwhite
males.3 The balanced panel shows more improvement for whites during the training period
(but note that the training period for the balanced panel is not the same time span). These
gains exhibit important racial differences: for whites, in the training period (1900–29) the
increases in life expectancy (in years of life per year of time) were 0.40 (c) for males and 0.42
(d) for females; for nonwhites it was 0.53 (e) for both sexes. The next six columns of table 1
summarize 1929–40. In keeping with generally upward trends, the minimum life expectancy
data always occur in 1929, and the maxima always occur in 1939 or 1940. Unsurprisingly
given figures 2–4, all groups make substantial gains in life expectancy during the twelve-year
period beginning with the Great Depression, compared to the thirty-year training period.
Given the profound compositional change in the Death Registration Area, especially as
regards race (see footnote 3), it is important to look at the balanced panel of states. From
1910–29, white expansion of life expectancy was 0.38 years per year for either sex (f ),
while for nonwhites it was less, 0.31 (g) and 0.37 (h) for males and females respectively.
In the twelve-year period beginning in 1929, life expectancy grew on average at a higher
rate: for whites, 0.41 (i) and 0.47 (j) years per year for males and females, respectively.
For nonwhites, the gains were astronomical: 0.78 (males) and 0.75 (females) years of life
expectancy per calendar year (k and l, respectively). These increases are not due to changing
composition of states, although changing composition of people, due to internal migration
(and new birth cohorts) can affect the changes. The pace of improvement for nonwhites in
the balanced-panel states from 1929–40 is nothing short of remarkable and is more than
three times greater than Oeppen and Vaupel’s (2002) finding of 0.243 years per year for
“best-practice” life expectancy gain at the global level (note also that that study was of
record life expectancy among a sample of countries). Life expectancy is well-known to be
affected by mortality levels at young ages, because child deaths result in more years of life
lost. Nonetheless, the racial changes we see in life expectancy at birth are mirrored by life
expectancy at age fifteen (cf. table 2, in Appendix I). The mortality changes we are studying
are not concentrated in childhood.

2 For the balanced panel (Appendix III, p.19), the nonwhite peak for females occurs at the end of the
training data (1929), not 1922 (table 1).
3 Life expectancy for all races is always in-between that for whites and nonwhites. However, the changing
racial composition of the Death Registration Area during this period accounts for the peculiar aspect that
∆ e(0) for all races is not sandwiched between that for whites and nonwhites. If the proportion nonwhite were
the same at the start- and end-points, the ∆ e(0) would also be sandwiched. However, the proportion nonwhite
changes substantially, throwing off the comparison. Due principally to changes in which states were in the
Death Registration Area, the proportion nonwhite changed drastically in this time period. For instance, in
1900 for males, 2.1% of the registration population was nonwhite compared to 9.8% in 1929 (cf. Linder and
Grove, 1943, table VIII). The 1929 death registration states included Nevada and New Mexico for the first
time, and excluded only Texas (added in 1933), and Alaska and Hawai’i (not yet states) (Hetzel, 1997).

Life expectancy in the Great Depression

Discussion
To briefly summarize the results, life expectancy improved during the Great Depression in
the United States — more for females than males, and much more for nonwhites than whites.
For nonwhites, both sexes escaped a Lee-Carter projection interval based on 1900–29, and
nonwhite females saw the most notable increases. Nothing in the balanced panel analyses
(Appendix III) indicates that these findings are an artifact of the changing composition of
the Death Registration Area. At lower levels of life expectancy, a fixed percentage improvement in death rates makes a larger change in life expectancy (Karpinos 1946; Mitra 1979;
Pollard 1982; Keyfitz 1985, pp.62–72; Vaupel 1986). Thus, in the present context, assuming
the same proportional changes in death rates, we expect a slightly bigger response in life
expectancy for nonwhites. However, the Lee-Carter analysis clearly shows that changes in
nonwhite mortality were more profound.
The quality of mortality data for whites and nonwhites should not be assumed to be the
same. Having complete death registration (and therefore being included in the Death Registration Area) meant registering at least 90% of deaths (Hetzel, 1997). Up to ten percent of
deaths could be unregistered, and these could have been disproportionately nonwhite. Population denominators come from the census, for which nonwhite data quality was worse than
that for whites (Karpinos, 1939; Myers, 1941; Price, 1947). Although both nonwhite deaths
and population were under-ascertained, it is unlikely that census undercounts mirrored death
underregistration on an age- sex- and race-specific basis. Numerator-denominator mismatch
can bias nonwhite death rates downward. Despite the stark differences in white and nonwhite life expectancies, in reality the gap may have been even larger (Elo, 2001).
A related problem is age misreporting, thought to be greater among nonwhites. Complete birth registration, key in establishing age, came later than complete death registration,
especially in poor southern counties where most nonwhites were born in the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries (Preston et al, 1998). This distorts age-specific death rates; in any
event, data quality for nonwhites was poorer in this time period (Demeny and Gingrich,
1967; Zelnik, 1969; Ewbank, 1987) and beyond (Elo and Preston, 1994; Preston et al, 1996;
Hill et al, 1997; Preston and Elo, 2006). The life expectancy calculations require, as input,
death rates at all ages, so the new series of infant mortality data by Eriksson et al (2018)
does not help in this application.
These data quality issues do not make our results uninterpretable. Our goal is to look at
life expectancy differences over time, not to hang our hat on any particular point estimate.
Many of the measurement issues with nonwhite life expectancy are constant over short time
intervals, and therefore do not affect inference about the Great Depression. Clearly, growth
in life expectancy for nonwhites was greater than that for whites (figure 3 vs. figure 4). The
data we analyze are aggregate vital statistics, fit for the purpose of identifying trends but less
suited to testing hypotheses about mechanisms.
The Great Depression overlapped with what is called the Great Migration, or the movement of blacks out of the South (both rural and urban) and into the more industrialized
North (Eldridge and Thomas, 1964; Fligstein, 1981; Alexander, 1998). “More than 40% of
the southern black population migrated out of the South between 1915 and 1970” (Boustan and Margo, 2016). This may have played a role in the racial differences in mortality
change that we observe. Eriksson and Niemesh (2016) argue that black infant mortality was
higher among births to migrants to the North. Thus, the mechanism may be slowing of the
Great Migration during the Great Depression (Boone and Wilse-Samson, 2019). While the
Great Migration is a potential explanation, annual data on internal migration flows by race
are lacking (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1946; Fishback et al, 2006; Boustan et al, 2010;

10

Tim A. Bruckner et al.

Gutmann et al, 2016). Our results permit hypothesis formation that the Great Migration may
have played a role in the mortality changes we observe, but we do not have the data to test
this hypothesis.4 We encourage other scholars to consider it.5
Direct assistance programs may also play a role in the observed trends. Fishback et al
(2018) show that blacks benefited from public relief programs by 1933 (see also Liu and
Fishback, 2019). However, note that the New Deal programs — which probably reduced
infant mortality (Fishback et al, 2001) — began in 1933. This is consistent with the gains
seen in nonwhite life expectancy after 1936 (figure 4) but was too late to affect the 1929–33
changes which are our principal focus. General improvements in public health programs
during this period were either explicitly part of the New Deal and hence began in 1933, or
were not limited to 1929–33 (Duffy, 1990, pp.256–270). Moreover, the period 1929–33 was
not a watershed in medical innovation. The first group of modern antibiotics did not come
into use until 1937 (Lesch, 2007; Jayachandran et al, 2010), and no major vaccines were
invented. In any case, it would be peculiar if a medical-technological innovation favored
nonwhites (Link and Phelan, 1995).

Conclusion
Life expectancy increased during the Great Depression (Tapia Granados and Diez Roux,
2009). This is interesting in and of itself, especially since it may be regarded as counterintuitive. For the population as a whole, the rise in life expectancy in 1930–33 does not exceed a
Lee-Carter projection interval constructed from pre-1930 data, as described. Thus, although
it is a prosaic explanation, continuation of secular trend (a juggernaut underway before the
Great Depression) may well explain the pattern of life expectancy in the early 1930s. This
is congruent with Stuckler et al (2012) (see also Tapia Granados 2012, 2013 and Stuckler
et al 2013). Our principal finding is that race-specific analyses reveal a divergence in life expectancy after 1930. Nonwhite Americans (overwhelmingly blacks during this period) show
a sharp rise in life expectancy in 1930–33 that exceeds the projection interval; this holds for
both sexes.
Strengths of our approach include use of the widely accepted Lee-Carter method to
compute a projection interval for life expectancy. Given the constraint of only 30 data points
before the Great Depression (viz., 1900–29), the Lee-Carter method is an appropriate way to
make a counterfactual projection of life expectancy during the Great Depression, based only
on prior mortality data. An additional strength of our approach is that we include a balanced
panel, the Death Registration States of 1910. Although the balanced panel results do not affect the overall conclusions, this is only knowable ex-post. We also analyzed nonwhites and
whites separately, which allowed us to show distinct differences in life expectancy patterns
during and after the Great Depression.
This study has a number of limitations. Our principal finding refers to nonwhites, but, as
discussed, this is the group for which data quality is poorest. Since we are more interested in
trends than levels, we think our findings are robust, but clearly better data quality is always
4 Moreover, the Great Migration involved blacks moving from areas with worse data quality to areas with
better data quality, which can also introduce a bias (Arthi et al, 2017).
5 There has recently been a renaissance in Great Migration studies; cf. Eichenlaub et al (2010); Collins
and Wanamaker (2014); Black et al (2015); Gutmann et al (2016); Alexander et al (2017); Boustan (2017),
among others.

a desideratum. Choosing the best input data (i.e., training data for the trend) to calculate an
uncertainty interval for life expectancy is tricky.6
Mortality data for the United States are available since 1900 and it is thus not possible
to study trends in life expectancy over a longer period of time before the Great Depression.
Compositional changes in the Death Registration Area add to the input data challenges;
using the balanced panel corrects for this, but at the cost of having ten fewer input observations. However, the balanced panel (Appendix III, p.19) is of states — not of people — and
these states were on the receiving end of the Great Migration.
There is increasing evidence that mortality and the economy are procyclical. When the
economy declines, so do death rates (Edwards, 2008; Ruhm, 2016).7 Great Depression findings (Fishback et al 2007; Tapia Granados and Diez Roux 2009; present work) agree with
this. Heart disease was a more important cause of death in the 1960s than either during the
Great Depression or nowadays (Goldman and Cook 1984; Tate et al 2016). Thus, the decline
in the relative importance of heart disease mortality may explain some of the divergence between older and more recent work on this cyclicality. This could be one of the reasons both
the Great Depression era and recent times are procyclical, while mid-century evidence is
more elusive. Other prominent causes of death that have been linked to the economy are air
pollution (Schwartz and Dockery, 1992), accidents (Ruhm, 2015; He, 2016), and alcoholrelated deaths (Brenner, 1975; Norström, 2007). Replicating our projection-based analysis
with a portfolio of cause-specific projections is not an alternative (Wilmoth, 1995).
A possible explanation for our findings is a temporary abatement of the Great Migration.
Whether or not the nexus between our findings and the Great Migration is causal or coincidental, our findings are principally descriptive demography. This study uses vital statistics
(i.e., aggregate data) and thus, does not address causality in the way that microdata could.
Nonetheless, this is a useful addition to knowledge about mortality in the Great Depression
because of how our findings highlight nonwhite mortality changes, as well how they show
that the changes for the total population are hard to distinguish from the prior trend.
Our study refines prior work by using uncertainty intervals (specifically, a Lee-Carter
projection interval based on 1900–29), and by focusing on race. Prior studies have noted that
life expectancy expanded during the Great Depression, but the present work underscores
that racial differences are key, and that for whites the changes, while positive, were not
remarkable. Our principal finding agrees with the idea that the Great Depression was pivotal
for life expectancy, but highlights that this is much clearer for nonwhites. We urge scholars
working on health and mortality during 1920–40 to stratify their analyses by race wherever
the data permit it.

Appendix I: Input data description
This appendix presents an overview of the input data: three tables of descriptive statistics,
followed by graphs. Table 2 table summarizes empirical changes in e(0) and e(15) from
1929 and 1933, demonstrating that the racial differences are not concentrated in childhood.
6 Here we mean an uncertainty interval as regards continuation, or not, of prior trend (like our Lee-Carter
projection interval), as opposed to statistical uncertainty of life expectancy point estimates. For the latter, see
Wilson (1938); Chiang (1984); Brillinger (1986); Lo et al (2016).
7 There is a debate about time scale (Brenner, 1979a,b, 1981) and whole- versus sub-populations (Sullivan
and von Wachter, 2009; Noelke and Beckfield, 2014). See also Miller et al (2009); Stevens et al (2015); Cutler
et al (2016); Seeman et al (2018). The debate between Tapia Granados (2005a,b) and McKee and Suhrcke
(2005) and Brenner (2005) is likewise relevant.

Appendix II: Lee-Carter methodology
Here we provide greater detail on how the Lee-Carter projections were constructed. The
complete IDL code and input data are available in the online SI: https://doi.org/10.
6084/m9.figshare.8479268.
The general description of the method is in the main body of the paper; what follows is
a more step-by-step description of how we implemented the Lee Carter models used in this
paper:
1. Create a matrix, M, of logged age-specific death rates over time. The columns are the
years and the rows are the ages. The first row is the logged death rate for infants, over
time; the second row is the logged death rate for age 1–4, over time; and so on.
In our application, the first year is 1900 and the last year is 1929. Thus:


log(M(0)1900 )
log(M(0)1901) · · · log(M(0)1929 )
 log(M(1–4)1900 ) log(M(1–4)1901 ) · · · log(M(1–4)1929 ) 


M=

..
..
..
..


.
.
.
.
log(M(≥ 85)1900 ) log(M(≥ 85)1901 ) · · · log(M(≥ 85)1929 )
in which M(x)YYYY is the age-specific death rate at age group x in year YYYY.
This matrix contains the training data. In our case, 1918 was removed for reasons discussed in the main text; the 1917 column is followed by the 1919 column.
2. Calculate the Lee-Carter a values. As discussed in Lee (2000), in place of the row means
(cf. Lee and Carter, 1992), use the final year of the training data (1929, in this example).
Create a matrix of the same dimensions of M, in which the columns are the final column
of M, replicated. Thus:


log(M(0)1929 )
log(M(0)1929 ) · · · log(M(0)1929)
 log(M(1–4)1929 ) log(M(1–4)1929 ) · · · log(M(1–4)1929 ) 


a=

..
..
..
..


.
.
.
.
log(M(≥ 85)1929 ) log(M(≥ 85)1929 ) · · · log(M(≥ 85)1929 )
3. Create a new matrix, Q = M − a.
4. Calculate the singular value decomposition, SVD, (Golub and Van Loan, 1996, pp.69–
75) of Q′ . The transpose of Q has m={number of years} rows and n={number of age
groups} columns. The SVD generates W, an n-element vector of singular values; U, an
m × n matrix; and V, an n × n matrix. Let T equal the sum of the elements of the first
column of V.
5. The Lee-Carter b values are the first column of V, normalized to sum to 1.0: b = V(:
, 1)/T .
6. The Lee-Carter k values are the first column of U, multiplied by T , multiplied by the
first singular value: k = U(:, 1)T W(1). The k values are a m-element vector (i.e., one
for each year).
7. Some summary statistics of k, as estimated from the training data, will govern the behavior of the future (i.e., counterfactual) projection of the k parameter, which is the kernel
of the Lee-Carter projection method.
8. The drift parameter is estimated as the slope of k over time. In the equation k = α + β X,
in which the Y is the vector of years (1900, 1901, . . . ), the drift parameter is β̂ , from
OLS. The drift parameter is race- and sex-specific.

18

Tim A. Bruckner et al.

9. The random deviations of the drift parameter are linked between the sexes. As discussed
in the main body of the text, an “up” year for males tends to be an “up” year for females
as well (and vice versa), and the same for “down” years, and so on. To accomplish
this, the random deviations used in the projection are drawn from a multivariate normal
distribution — not as univariate random deviates.
To perform multivariate pseudorandom deviate generation during the projection part, we
will require the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix of the male and female k steps from
the training data (see, f.e., Selvin, 1998, p.190).
Linearly detrend the fitted k values by sex, then take first-differences. The trend will
be “baked into the cake”, so to speak, of the projection — so the deviations we are
interested in right now are the detrended series. Calculate the VCV matrix of these male
and female k differences.
This procedure is done separately by racial groups. The interdependencies modeled are
between males and females, but do not span races.
10. The Lee-Carter projection is a Brownian random walk with drift, of the k parameter,
using the drift parameter from step 8.
The projected k values start at zero in the knot year (1929). For each year of the projection, they are adjusted by both the drift parameter from step 8 and by randomness. The
randomness is modeled as a pseudorandom bivariate normal deviate. Most software has
built-in multivariate normal routines; use the VCV from step 9 as input. If this is not
available, multivariate normal deviates can be generated from the Cholesky decomposition of the VCV matrix (see Selvin, 1998). The random deviation from the annual drift
is normally-distributed with the same variance as the series of estimated k values from
step 6. It also has the same male:female covariance.
At the end of each model iteration, we have a set of projected k values (for each sex),
for the desired number of years in the “future”. Store these in memory.
11. Repeat step 10, one million times.
This is done separately by race. The sexes are linked as described in steps 9 and 10,
but each race×sex series has its own collection of one million sequences of projected k
values.
12. For all years of each of the counterfactual projections (i.e., by race×sex), compute the
2.5 and 97.5 percentiles.
These k values will determine the projection fans that are visualized in the paper.
13. Next, convert the k percentiles as calculated in step 12 to life expectancy values. Do not
do this for all one million results per sex and race; just use the values determined in
step 12.
14. First calculate predicted M(x) values:

Mi,p = a + bki,p

in which Mi,p is the vector of M(x) values for projected year i at percentile p (i.e., 2.5 or
97.5), and a is any single column of the matrix a discussed in step 2, b is as described in
step 5, and ki,p is as described in step 12. Note that the Mi,p is not the same as the input
matrix M in step 1, and this a is a subset of the one in step 2.
15. Convert the M(x) values from step 14 into life expectancies using the typical demographic formulae (see, f.e., Preston et al, 2001; Wachter, 2014, etc.)
16. This completes the Lee-Carter projection procedure.

Appendix III: Balanced-panel graphs
The graphs in this appendix replicate the main analysis of the paper, using the death registration states of 1910.8 The Death Registration Area (DRA) of the United States changed a lot
in the period 1900–32, so some of the year-to-year variation is a compositional artifact. This
can affect the Lee-Carter model, and the results in this appendix control for this. The solid
lines with the shaded projection fan are the death registration states of 1910. Everything
is done just as described the main text, but the data come from a balanced panel of states.
This controls for the changing composition. Unfortunately, this also changes the length of
the training data, which can affect the variance used in the Lee-Carter projection, so is not
a perfect control. To assess whether having ten fewer observations (viz., missing 1900–09)
affects the Lee-Carter projection fan, we also analyzed the variable-composition DRA data,
but starting in 1910. The dashed lines with the hatched projection fan are for same data as
in the main text (i.e., the DRA), but subsetted to 1910 onward.
In short, while the graphs in the main text use all available data (1900–29), the time series and projection fans in this appendix provide a comparison to a balanced panel, with two
fans per graph to additionally control for the length of the estimation period being shorter
than that in the main text. An alternate approach would be to use the death registration states
of 19009 as the balanced panel, thus removing the question of different length time series.
However, these states are not a good control because they are even more unrepresentative,
being skewed heavily to the northeast. There is no comparable data set on the death registration states of 1920. Table 5 shows the width of the projection fans in 1940, for all the
graphs. For the total population, and for whites, there is not a major impact of switching to
a start date of 1910 or of using the balanced panel. For nonwhites, the differences are more
substantial, in keeping with the changes associated with the Great Migration, discussed in
the main text.
