Abstract

24

Fieldwork and desk-based research in the western Amazon basin has led to an explosive growth

25

in the state of knowledge surrounding the pre-Columbian archaeology of this region.

26

Previously thought to be a sparsely occupied environment, archaeologists have recorded

27

hundreds of geometric earthworks between the Purús and Acre rivers in recent years, spurring

28

renewed interest in understanding the distribution, age, and function of these structures. A

29

challenge has been to identify possible relationships between sites and to place them in their

30

broader landscape setting. The precise spatial scale, relative importance of different factors,

31

and strength of any relationships that contributed to shaping their distributions remain an open

32

question. This paper develops and applies an explicitly spatial framework to address this

33

problem, drawing on a rich body of recent research in Acre state (Brazil) and advanced point
1

34

process modelling. The analytical approach, which is fully documented and reproducible with

35

the accompanying code, infers the factors affecting geometric earthwork distribution at

36

multiple spatial scales. This enables the first robust predictions of territorial integration in the

37

region, which is discussed context of extant archaeological models. The findings support the

38

interpretation that non-stratified societies likely occupied Acre during the late pre-Columbian

39

period.

1. Introduction

45

The geometric earthworks of the western Amazon basin have received substantial attention in

46

the pursuit of understanding their distribution, context, purpose, and meaning. First

47

documented in the early 1990s, and possibly earlier (Ranzi 2003; Ranzi et al. 2007; Dias 2006;

48

Schaan 2012), the known structures are located primarily in the interfluvial uplands of the

49

upper Purús and Acre rivers in the modern Brazilian state of Acre. Viewed in the context of

50

key debates in Amazonian archaeology that were coming to a head by the end of the 1990s and

51

early 2000s (Meggers 1992; Denevan 1996; Heckenberger et al. 1999; 2001; Meggers 2001;

52

Stahl 2002), geometric earthworks have attracted widespread interest as proof that indigenous

53

societies could thrive far from more agriculturally-attractive sedimentary floodplains (Schaan

54

2012; Watling et al. 2018). With time, well over 400 individual geometric earthworks, also

55

termed ditched enclosures or “geoglyphs”, have been documented through aerial and remote

56

sensing surveys (Ranzi et al. 2007; Schaan 2012; Saunaluoma 2012). This number increases

57

with every publication, in the course of which archaeologists have continued to add nuance as

58

new information is revealed. Notably, targeted efforts to understand geometric earthwork

59

chronology, function, and ecological context through excavation have yielded significant

60

insights into the societies that built them, as well as their land use practices (Saunaluoma and

61

Virtanen 2015; Watling et al. 2017). Archaeological ceramics recovered from geometric

62

earthworks suggest their embeddedness within a broader pan-Amazonian cultural milieu and a

63

probable ceremonial purpose in prestige-enhancing displays (Pärssinen et al. 2009; Schaan et

64

al. 2007; Schaan et al. 2010; Saunaluoma 2012). On the other hand, the relative scarcity of

65

cultural deposits argues against persistent occupation within these sites. They are,

66

consequently, interpreted as unlikely to have functioned as settlements. Taken as a whole,

67

radiocarbon assays on geometric earthworks have yielded dates spanning at least two millennia

from 1215-1009 cal BC to 1218-1291 cal AD (Ua-37238 and Hela-616, respectively, calibrated

69

at 2σ with the SHCal13 curve, Saunaluoma and Schaan 2012; Hogg et al. 2013), although there

70

are significant gaps across the set, as well as occasional unresolved inversions in individual

71

soil profile ages (Watling et al. 2017). Terrestrial palaeoecological records reveal an apparent

72

absence of large-scale forest clearance in the landscapes around geometric earthworks

73

throughout their entire period of use (Watling et al. 2017). Nonetheless, microbotanical data

74

from archaeological contexts provide evidence for subsistence practices that employed both
3

75

domesticated and wild food resources, in particular palm fruit and brazil nut, suggesting that a

76

mixed system of managed agroforestry with cultigens existed in the past (Watling et al. 2015;

77

Watling et al. 2018). Although circular and rectangular plans predominate among geometric

78

earthworks, a variety of shapes have been reported, including polygons, ovals, and D- and U-

79

shaped earthworks. Rarely, causeways or “avenues” connect earthworks, while the enclosures

80

themselves can have single or multiple ditches and berms. Within this relatively restricted

81

range of attributes, geometric earthworks nonetheless exhibit a high degree of formal

82

variability in their architectural characteristics and configurations. In certain rare cases,

83

earthworks were constructed either abutting or overlaying previous earthworks, possibly

84

indicating the long-term use of particular places and parts of the landscape. Schaan (2012), in

85

plotting the raw distribution of earthwork shapes and sizes, has suggested that these variables

86

might encode cultural preferences or chronological trends.

87
88

Major advances in knowledge on the geometric earthworks have occurred in a relatively short

89

span of time, speaking to a vigorous programmatic interest among scholars of Amazonian

90

indigenous history. Extensive research across the southern rim of the basin has attested to other,

91

occasionally contemporaneous, traditions of earthwork construction that performed a range of

92

domestic, ceremonial, and subsistence roles for the societies that erected them (Denevan 1963;

93

Arnold and Prettol 1988; Heckenberger 2005; Walker 2008; Erickson 2006; 2010; Lombardo

94

and Prümers 2010; Carson et al. 2014; Prümers 2014; Prümers and Jaimes Betancourt 2014;

95

De Souza et al. 2018). Archaeologists have also written extensively on the degree of social

96

complexity among the populations involved in the construction of the geometric earthworks in

97

the modern states of Acre, Rondônia, and Amazonas (Pärssinen et al. 2009; Schaan 2012;

98

Saunaluoma and Schaan 2012; Saunaluoma 2012; Saunaluoma and Virtanen 2015;

99

Saunaluoma et al. 2018; Watling et al. 2018). Taking a broad view of the above publications,

100

certain commonalities emerge and can be summarised here briefly. First, sizeable populations,

101

possibly totalling in the tens of thousands, are estimated to be responsible for the geometric

102

earthworks. Concordantly, some degree of supra-local organisation may well be behind

103

coordinating the number of people at, or close to, such an order of magnitude. The available

104

archaeological data does not indicate the widespread or ubiquitous settlement nucleation,

105

however, suggesting that settlement was dispersed over a relatively large area, or has at least

106

left a less obtrusive archaeological signal (Saunaluoma et al. 2018). Political authority, as such,

107

was likely to have been transient and derived from skilfully leveraging symbolic or ritual

108

capital in the context of ceremonial performance associated to geometric earthworks.
4

109
110

Analyses of the broader landscape of geometric earthworks have proposed social processes

111

behind their formation with direct reference to a model of organisational structure that

112

underscores the potential interplay between hierarchy and heterarchy (Crumley 1979; 1995).

113

The latter term implies power relations that are distributed, unranked, or marked in varying

114

ways depending on the scale or frame of reference, emphasising the relational nature of

115

authority derived through corporate mechanisms (Ashmore 2002; Morehart et al. 2018: 14;

116

Furholt et al. 2019). The term is not construed as inimical or opposed to the existence of

117

hierarchical, vertical, or ranked structures, which may co-exist or be negotiated alongside such

118

lateral relationships (DeMarrais 2013). Indeed, the existence of multiple equivalently valued

119

agencies or agendas in heterarchical configurations, and the societal tensions stemming from

120

the resulting dynamics, is suggested as a major driver of social differentiation among humans

121

(Furholt et al. 2019: 7). Prehistoric contexts across the globe provide examples for this pattern,

122

and there are compelling empirical reasons to entertain the possibility of their existence in

123

Amazonia too (Roosevelt 1999; Schaan 2012; Balée et al. 2014). Specifically, pre-Columbian

124

communities are envisioned as nominally autonomous yet possessing internal social rankings

125

that were occasionally brought to the fore. Materialised in Acre in the form of geometric

126

earthworks, the interplay between distinctive types of organisation in the pre-Columbian period

127

is cited as the dynamic that drove the formation of “complex” social formations (Schaan et al.

128

2010; Schaan 2012; Saunaluoma et al. 2018).

129
130

Formalising spatial relationships

131

Interpretative models of landscapes and land use provide a useful point of departure for

132

developing the present spatial analytical approach toward geometric earthworks. This paper

133

contends that directly investigating spatial structure at multiple scales may help elucidate the

134

dynamics responsible for the formation of the archaeological landscape of Acre (Crumley

135

1979: 144). In particular, I draw on the suggestion that regional heterarchies are an inherently

136

multiscalar, spatial phenomena (Crumley 1979, 1995; Ashmore 2002). Although formal tests

137

of this assertion have been slow to materialise (Ashmore 2002: 1177; Smith and Schreiber

138

2005; Carballo et al. 2014), modern point process modelling offers the opportunity to test for

139

the presence and type of spatial behaviour within a large sample of significant monumental

140

sites (Baddeley and Turner 2005; Baddeley et al. 2016). The vast area and chronological span

141

over which geometric earthworks occur pose a challenge to generalising as to their precise role

142

among the pre-Columbian societies that constructed them. With the data currently available,
5

143

we cannot at present preclude that both function and meaning also changed substantially over

144

the two millennia or more of their existence. Multiscalar point pattern analysis has emerged as

145

one of the solutions for direct analyses of the complexity of the archaeological record (Bevan

146

et al. 2013; Eve and Crema 2014; Riris 2017; Dreslerová and Demján 2019). These methods

147

offer an advantage over fixed-scale descriptive spatial statistics, such as nearest neighbour,

148

which are easily confounded by the spatially variable nature of much archaeological data (Riris

149

2017; Carrero-Pazos et al. 2019). In another sense, computational modelling also offers the

150

opportunity to test the myriad interpretations of the archaeological record. Here, incorporating

151

a range of spatial effects and processes into formal models, including what are usually termed

152

“first-order” (exogenously induced variables influencing the density of points) and “second-

153

order” (the density of points as affected by the endogenous configurations of other points)

154

effects, put these types of analyses on a robust footing for inferring socio-political dynamics.

155

In particular, what was the spatial scale of integration among geometric earthwork building

156

societies? To what extent does spatial structure index social structure? Is it possible to settle on

157

just one scale, singular, or do patterns of import occur at multiple spatial scales? These

158

questions reflect notable gaps in knowledge on the presence and strength of spatial

159

relationships between geometric earthworks, which this paper will attempt to address

160

employing a formal modelling approach.

161
162

Archaeologists observe marked consistencies among the settings of geometric earthworks

163

(Schaan et al. 2010; Schaan 2012; Saunaluoma et al. 2018). Even a cursory look at the overall

164

distribution indicates that geometric earthworks are far from randomly distributed (Fig. 1). To

165

briefly summarise the locational characteristics that appear repeatedly and consistently across

166

the abovementioned literature: geometric earthworks are typically located at elevation within

167

the overall gently rolling topography of the Purús and Acre interfluves. Moreover, their

168

placement also tends to be on prominent bluffs relative to their surroundings, as opposed to

169

simply at altitude in absolute terms. Finally, while water availability is not typically thought to

170

be a factor despite the seasonally dry (monsoonal) climate of the region, proximity to large,

171

perennial watercourses, as potential arteries of communication and transport, likely exert some

172

influence on the placement of these sites. Next, and temporarily leaving the landscape to one

173

side, a closer look at the locations of geometric earthworks alone may indicate that they form

174

clusters separated by relatively short (~5 km or less) or alternatively at much longer ranges

175

(>10 km) too. In other words, monument locations may also depend in some way on the

176

locations of others. Notably, Schaan (2012: 154-155) explicitly connects site size to labour
6

177

mobilisation and suggests the existence of territorial interaction between clusters at a regional

178

scale, centred on the locations of the largest of geometric earthworks. In this sense, and with

179

reference to the inferred presence of complex heterarchical organisation here, spatial

180

distributions have long been interpreted as indexing social relations.

181
182

A principal strength of the method developed and applied here is the explicit recognition that

183

the factors that drive spatial phenomena (here, monument location) can also vary spatially. A

184

basic inspection of geometric earthworks distributed within Acre indicates that, like many

185

empirical point patterns, spatial inhomogeneity cannot be ruled out (Fig. 1). Previous locational

186

models employing similar data have largely employed methods that assume a homogeneous

187

point pattern intensity (McMichael et al. 2014a; 2014b; De Souza et al. 2018). This paper

188

attempts to remedy this by examining the variability in spatial patterning (inhomogeneous

189

dispersion and/or aggregation) at multiple scales simultaneously, while controlling for both

190

induced effects and between-point interaction. This advance in method bridges the correlative

191

(first-order) and relational (second-order) spatial properties of the archaeological record, which

192

are frequently key factors in data that is fundamentally human in nature.

193
194

In summary, this paper uses point process modelling to explicitly control for the effects of

195

external variables on the distribution of geometric earthworks, which are drawn from the

196

literature. The approach also introduces a second-order (inter-site) interaction term, which

197

together with the initial model successfully describes the majority of spatial structure among

198

the geometric earthworks of Acre. Together, this multivariate model evaluates the relative

199

influence of concurrent spatial phenomena on the distribution of geometric earthworks in a

200

robust statistical framework. Additional tests on the fitted models reveal a statistically

201

significant clustering threshold, identifying empirically-supported groups of sites in the

202

process. A Monte Carlo test of the distribution of geometric earthwork sizes within and

203

between these groups (Carrero-Pazos et al. 2019) is adapted to investigate if intra-cluster site

204

hierarchies are present. Summarising, based on present information, the model-testing

205

approach indicates that the populations responsible for the creation of geometric earthworks in

206

western Amazonia are highly unlikely to have been hierarchically organised either at a regional

207

scale, or within groups of sites.

208
209

2. Materials and Methods

7

210

This study focuses primarily on pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in Acre state, Brazil, the

211

core area reported in the literature (Schaan 2012; Saunaluoma and Virtanen 2015; Watling et

212

al. 2018). Hereafter, all references to earthworks refer to geometric earthworks located in Acre

213

unless otherwise noted. The reported locations of archaeological sites were gathered through a

214

literature survey, which formed the initial dataset. All earthwork locations were also cross-

215

referenced with public domain satellite imagery available through the ESRI ArcGIS Online

216

platform and Google Earth. Following analytical and interpretative precedent by Schaan

217

(2012), earthwork surface area was directly estimated from the available imagery in the course

218

of data collection. Surface area was consistently measured from the outer perimeter of

219

earthwork banks or berms and the area enclosed by ditches therefore contributes to the total.

220

In rare cases where multiple enclosures are connected through ‘avenues’, and sequences of

221

construction cannot be discerned, their combined area is reported. Furthermore, for the handful

222

of earthworks (<5) that directly abut or overlay each other, and where the sequence of

223

construction cannot be discerned from remotely sensed imagery alone, their location is reported

224

as a single centroid of the combined outlines. Other aspects of geometric earthwork

225

monumentality, such as berm height and ditch depth or indices of architectural complexity,

226

may conceivably be relevant to understanding the energetics and relative configuration of the

227

archaeological landscape of Acre. In this paper, I limit analysis to area enclosed as a first order

228

approximation of earthwork size as a possible index of elaboration (Schaan 2012).

229
230

Data collection resulted in a total of 420 point locations that could be derived directly from

231

published maps, with associated information. The majority of earthworks (n = 312) lie within

232

the state of Acre, where agribusiness-led deforestation, centred on the town of Rio Branco, is

233

most extensive. The remaining 108 earthworks were encountered in Rondônia and Amazonas

234

states. Absent widely available canopy-penetrating remote sensing technology (Prümers and

235

Jaimes Betancourt 2014), it must be cautioned that the representativity of the sample is

236

essentially dictated by the extent of deforestation. As this process is decidedly more advanced

237

in Acre compared to neighbouring states, the data affords improved control and explanatory

238

power over the areas of Amazonas and Rondônia where forest removal is less complete. To

239

avoid spurious results due to uneven sampling, this study is restricted to the area formed by the

240

convex hull of earthworks within Acre, buffered by 3 km to mitigate edge effects. This

241

approach withholds sites located in Rondônia and Amazonas from the study, pending

242

verification of the extent to which this subset of western Amazonian earthworks is

243

representative of a broader pattern beyond Acre.

245

As noted, point pattern analysis distinguishes primarily between first- and second-order spatial

246

trends, that is, structure induced by external processes, and the degree of attraction or repulsion

247

between points within a pattern (Diggle 2013). Bearing in mind the abovementioned

248

explanatory frameworks for the distribution of Amazonian earthworks, this paper leverages

249

modern spatial statistics and point process modelling to evaluate the degree to which

250

archaeological patterns might be influenced by both induced and internal spatial structure

251

concurrently. The principal findings are briefly summarised here, and the procedure is fully

252

described in the accompanying code (Supplementary Information). Employing

253

archaeological interpretations as a point of departure, the approach initially builds a model to

254

control for the presence and strength of first-order spatial trends among Amazonian geometric

255

earthworks. Next, a second-order interaction term is incorporated to account for spatial

256

interaction not explained by the null and baseline first-order models. The results and insight

257

gained from the modelling exercise detailed below reveals yet further statistically significant

258

spatial structure that neither model fully accounts for, individually or in tandem. Based on these
9

259

findings, a combination of machine learning algorithms (Ester et al. 1996) and additional

260

spatial statistical analysis integrating earthwork attribute data (Carrero-Pazos et al. 2019),

261

yields robust estimates for possible western Amazonian territorial units. Moreover, this

262

procedure conservatively identifies zones where archaeological data is presently lacking

263

enough detail to make confident inferences, in particular where sites are exceptionally sparse.

264
265

Fitting covariate spatial data

266

The covariate spatial data (Fig. 2) are consistently highlighted in the archaeological literature

267

as relevant to understanding geometric earthwork distributions across Acre (Schaan et al. 2010;

268

Schaan 2012; Saunaluoma et al. 2018). Here, I assess the interplay and relative influence, if

269

any, of each dataset. First, a multicollinearity test with Pearson’s R reveals that there are no

270

collinear effects between the datasets, indicating that they are suitable as independent model

271

terms. Next, the observed point pattern of geometric earthworks is fitted to a Poisson point

272

process model, equivalent to an initial null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness (CSR).

273

At the same, using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as a guideline for information

274

gain per added model term, a stepwise model selection procedure rejects none of the covariates

275

in isolation or in combination. The BIC suggests that a combination of all three covariates

276

provides the best starting point for modelling earthwork locations. Together, elevation,

277

topographical prominence, distance from water, and the assumed Poisson process comprise the

278

multivariate first-order model. The spatial intensity (density) of archaeological sites in Acre,

279

as described by the interaction of these parameters, is a function of their combined maximum

280

logistic likelihood. Third, to evaluate the possible effects of interaction at a landscape level

281

between earthworks, a second-order term is incorporated into the fitted first-order model to

282

generate a combined model. Such a model statistically accounts for induced and internal spatial

283

dynamics simultaneously. Here, following precedent for handling archaeological data in this

284

manner (Bevan et al. 2013), the area-interaction point process model is advanced to replace

285

CSR as the null and to capture the range of observed variability in the empirical point pattern.

286

Area-interaction is attractive due to its relative flexibility, generality, and lack of complex free

287

parameters. Alternatives such as the Hard Core, Matérn cluster, or Thomas process describe

288

processes that presume rather more about the formation of geometric earthwork distributions

289

than is presently known (Baddeley and Turner 2005). To obtain the best fit for the second-

290

order term, the joint probability distribution is estimated by log pseudolikelihood.

291

10

292

Finally, the goodness-of-fit of each of the three models is assessed comparatively employing

293

the pair correlation function. This statistic has some especial advantages in the context of the

294

goals of this study. For fitted models and point patterns, the statistic estimates the presence and

295

degree of spatial clustering and repulsion at multiple scales within the window of observation.

296

Unlike the classic Ripley’s K statistic, which employs discs to count and measure spatial

297

structure, the pair correlation function employs rings with outer and inner boundaries.

298

Consequently, patterning at different scales is more easily discerned visually (Stoyan and

299

Stoyan 1994; Baddeley et al. 2016). The fact that the function does not accumulate also

300

provides a more intuitive result (Wiegand and Moloney 2004: 225; Jacquemyn et al: 2007,

301

451). Rather than the more common spatially uniform version of this statistic, the

302

inhomogeneous variant used here accounts for differences in the density of the point pattern

303

across the study. In other words, it assumes that the point pattern has an underlying spatial

304

trend. Density-dependent variation is a well-known quality of earthwork locations (Schaan

305

2012; Saunaluoma et al. 2018) and controlling for this source of spatial structure can be

306

considered an initial step in uncovering the possible drivers of the formation of the

307

archaeological record.

308
309

To illustrate the critical scales where geometric earthworks attract or inhibit one another,

310

significance bands are derived via Monte Carlo simulations of point patterns drawn from the

311

null (random), first-, and second order models. Envelopes are generated by simulating 999

312

point patterns for each application of the pair-correlation function to the fitted models

313

(Baddeley and Turner 2005; Jacquemyn et al. 2007: 451). Rather than expressing confidence

314

to a chosen level (e.g. 95%), they estimate the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting the null

315

hypothesis of no spatial structure as a function of the number of simulated runs. For the

316

envelopes generated here, this value (α) corresponds to 0.002, which can be considered highly

317

robust for the purposes of the modelling exercise. It must be acknowledged that the null model

318

of complete spatial randomness (CSR) is unlikely to adequately reflect the empirical data, but

319

it is nonetheless presented for completeness. As described above, the first-order model also

320

assumes an underlying Poisson distribution, while the second-order model replaces this with

321

an Area Interaction term. The workflow is fully implemented as R code in the supplementary

322

information, with accompanying archaeological data, and draws extensively on functions in

323

the package ‘spatstat’ version 1.60-1 (Baddeley and Turner 2005).

324
325

3. Spatial point process modelling
11

326

Spatial structure between geometric earthworks is well-illustrated by the initial application of

327

the pair correlation function to the point pattern (Fig. 3, top left). Attending to the first

328

maximum and minimum outside the simulation envelope, these values correspond to the typical

329

range at which points are most strongly attracted or repelled by one another, respectively

330

(Strand et al. 2007). For Acre earthworks, this occurs below 500 m for clustering and at

331

approximately 13000 m for dispersion, with the observed value falling just outside the envelope

332

at this range. This initial finding suggests a variety of spatial processes may be at play, inducing

333

strong short-range clustering and somewhat weaker longer-range repulsion between

334

earthworks. Without further supporting information, such as fitted covariate data or point

335

process models beyond the null expectation of CSR, it must be underscored that this baseline

336

assessment lacks sufficient context to adequately explore the implications of these findings in

337

further detail. The analysis now turns to fitting the point pattern to covariate datasets derived

338

from close readings of the archaeological literature.

339
340

First-order model

341

The first-order model (Fig. 3, bottom left) provides a much improved fit over the CSR null

342

model, controlling for most of the weaker signals of spatial autocorrelation at all ranges from

343

>40 km to below 10 km. All three covariate datasets (Table 1) were found to be highly

344

significant. Nonetheless, the strong patterns of short-range clustering and long-range repulsion

345

of earthworks (beyond ~22 km) persist in this iteration. The predicted intensity (log-odds of

346

points per unit of area) from this model (Fig. 3, top right) provides an illustrative summary of

347

the degree to which this model explains spatial structure among geometric earthworks.

348

Although clearly spatially variable (inhomogeneous), the predicted spatial trend is weak, with

349

few zones showing values at the high end of the scale. Consequently, in agreement with the

350

results of the pair correlation function, the fitted first-order model indicates that a relatively

351

large proportion of spatial variation remains unaccounted for, in spite of the overall improved

352

fit. Rather than risk overfitting this model with covariate data beyond what is supported by

353

archaeological inference, the next step directly incorporates a model term to control for

354

between-point interaction, noting the exceptionally strong clustering found at ~450 m and

355

below.

Second-order model

13

360

The area-interaction process, as outlined above, is fitted by maximising the profile information

361

entropy with respect to a series of fixed spatial interaction distances (Baddeley and van

362

Lieshout 1995; Baddeley et al. 2016). The analysis is permuted in 100-metre intervals from

363

100 m to 2500 m to produce 25 candidate models, rather than impose a single arbitrary

364

interaction value. According to Akaike’s Information Criterion, this procedure provides a best

365

fit for the area interaction parameter at r = 2100 meters. The second model also incorporates

366

the first-order model as a trend parameter. This combined first- and second-order model thus

367

successfully controls for both exogenous and endogenous processes within the point pattern of

368

geometric earthworks. Conditioning the simulation envelope for the pair correlation function

369

on the combined null model (Fig. 3, bottom right) illustrates the effect of incorporating

370

between-point interaction. The results reveal most variability in spatial structure among

371

geometric earthworks can be explained by controlling for these factors. While models with a

372

better goodness-of-fit could be derived from alternative readings of the archaeological record,

373

the data is nonetheless satisfactorily explained by the combined model. The model terms are

374

derived from close readings of the archaeological record, which reduces need to develop a more

375

complex model that risks overfitting against the data.

376
377

A notable exception of spatial structure for which the combined model does not account is the

378

presence of statistically significant clustering in the range ~14500 – 15900 at a significance

379

level of 0.002 (above), with a local maximum at r = 15264 m. This indicates spatial patterning

380

among geometric earthworks that may be particularly relevant for understanding distributional

381

trends of broader importance among the earthworks analysed here and, ultimately, the decision-

382

making processes that led to the formation of the archaeological landscape of Acre. This

383

information is now used to draw further inferences on landscape-level patterns among

384

geometric earthworks through further tests of their properties and configurations.

385
386

4. Geometric earthwork clusters and size ranking

387
388

Building a point process model of earthworks in Acre has proven informative in several

389

regards. First, interpretations of their locational properties, expressed informally by

390

archaeologists, have been statistically expressed and validated. The importance of this should

391

not be understated. Drawing reliable conclusions as to the structure, formational processes, and

392

wider distributional patterns of geometric earthworks is key to building robust models of pre-

393

Columbian social organisation and going beyond the plain-language explanations typically
14

394

favoured by archaeologists. Additionally, while first-order factors do not explain the structure

395

of the archaeological point pattern on their own, the incorporation of a term to directly address

396

point interaction both provides a model with a good fit for the majority of the variability in the

397

Acre earthworks, and also hints towards resolving an elusive property of these structures.

398

Specifically, this discussion now draws attention to the spatial scale at which patterning among

399

geometric earthworks manifests most strongly (Fig. 3, bottom right). What might this imply

400

for the organisation and landscape-level structure of pre-Columbian societies in Acre and

401

western Amazonia more broadly?

402
403

This question is far from trivial, since direct connections have been drawn between the level

404

of regional integration, anthropic landscape history, and the size and elaboration of geometric

405

earthworks (Saunaluoma et al. 2018; Watling et al. 2018). A salient point first underlined by

406

Schaan (2012: 154-155) is that the distribution of the largest earthworks may reflect some

407

aspect of locally marked hierarchies, which interacted at a regional scale through horizontal

408

power relations. The knowledge gained from the point process modelling can be incorporated

409

into further exploratory analyses to this end. In summary: the results demonstrate that

410

significant spatial autocorrelation exists between earthworks in intervals of approximately ~15

411

km, or more precisely, a neighbourhood radius of around 7.5 km (7632 m, to be exact; Fig.

412

3D).

413
414

Using the neighbourhood radius as a distance threshold (ε) in DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial

415

Clustering of Applications with Noise; see Ester et al. 1996), a data-clustering algorithm

416

particularly suited to point patterns of arbitrary shape and density, groupings of earthworks

417

should emerge that reflect archaeologically meaningful units. Minimum group size is

418

somewhat arbitrarily set at three earthworks, a value that conservatively excludes most sites

419

that are located close to the edges of forest clearances (Fig. 2A). This minimum group size

420

threshold approximates a subset of earthworks on the study area boundaries that lack sufficient

421

context for robust interpretations for the time being. Undoubtedly there are more earthworks

422

waiting to be uncovered under the canopy. Finally, potential variation in group membership

423

was also considered by permuting the DBSCAN algorithm through the range of statistically

424

significant clustering (14500 – 15900 m in 100-metre intervals, Fig. 3D). This procedure

425

(Supplementary Fig. 1) illustrates that varying ε primarily alters the relative proportion of

426

“noisy” points with no group. While total number of groups varies between 17 and 21, most

427

shifts in membership occur overwhelmingly among the smallest permissible groups (3
15

428

earthworks), which either “become noisy” or join larger groups as the distance threshold

429

decreases or increases, respectively. Most of the groups detected by the algorithm are robust

430

across thresholds and do not have large alterations to their membership.

431

Fig. 4: Non-hierarchical organisation of Amazonian geometric earthworks. A: The
DBSCAN algorithm defines 19 discrete clusters, highlighted with their convex hulls, with
clusters defined at a threshold of ε = 7632 metres. Convex hulls do not imply territorial
extent, but are presented as a visual aid. Non-clustered points are represented as black dots.
B: Count of earthworks by group, minimum group size = 3. C: Differences in rank sums of
site area between an ideal hierarchy (green) and the observed distribution (purple) given the
same number of earthworks and groups. Further permutation testing indicates that these
differences are overwhelmingly likely due to chance rather than within-group hierarchies.
432

The 19 clusters defined among the earthworks at the strongest clustering threshold is shown in

433

Fig. 4A. The groups vary substantially in size from 71 earthworks, enclosing a total of 94.48

434

ha, to the minimum of three individual sites. The resulting output is visually intuitive, in the

435

sense that borders between clusters are readily apparent, as well as between the outliers. Groups

16

436

1, 2, and 4 clearly dominate the clusters in terms of sheer numbers, presenting a relatively

437

skewed distribution (Fig. 4B) with a few large groups and many smaller ones. Group 1 wholly

438

surrounds the much smaller Group 6. Nonetheless, the meaningful clusters generated by

439

combining the point process model with DBSCAN, though having highly uneven membership,

440

do not directly inform on whether relative rankings exist within them. Bearing in mind the role

441

of earthwork size in indexing relative site importance (Schaan 2012), if this attribute is a

442

possible marker of hierarchical social relations and community structure, the groupings

443

detected here may provide a useful point of departure for further analyses. To help approximate

444

a solution, the final part of this paper adapts a permutation test developed by Carrero-Pazos et

445

al. (2019) to examine if earthwork area is distributed more unevenly than would be expected

446

by random chance both between and within groups/clusters.

447
448

In outline (Carrero-Pazos et al. 2019: 6-7), the method orders all earthworks by size and creates

449

a ranking of site sizes within each group: the largest site in each cluster is graded 1, the second

450

largest is graded 2, and so on. The sum of observed grades by group is compared to the sum of

451

the ideal distribution of grades if a perfect site hierarchy were present, given the same number

452

of ranks. Consistently ideal size distributions within groups are expected to represent internally

453

ranked social formations. Here, the number of grades is 71, corresponding to the group size of

454

the largest group. Fig. 4C demonstrates that observed rankings overall tend to deviate from the

455

ideal rankings. Notably, size grades 1 and 2 (the largest earthworks, thought to be dominant

456

with each group) lie well below the rank sum that would be expected if a strong hierarchy of

457

sites were present within the groups of earthworks. Below the largest size grades, however, the

458

rank sums tend to exceed the expectations of the ideal ranking, suggesting that small-to-

459

medium earthworks are over-represented relative to the large or exceptionally large earthworks

460

in the sample. Initially, at least, an internal hierarchy of monuments is counter-indicated by this

461

test. In other words, if the clusters of geometric earthworks can be interpreted as reflecting

462

community organisation, it does not at present seem probable that they were strongly stratified.

463
464

To establish whether the differences between observation and expectation are greater than

465

could occur chance, the size grades can be randomly shuffled independent of group

466

membership. This is performed 999 times. The observed ranking can then be compared to the

467

simulated shuffled rankings, with an associated p-value. This procedure indicates that at almost

468

every grade, the distribution of earthwork sizes in the 19 groups (Fig. 4A) cannot be

469

distinguished from the null hypothesis of no internal rankings (Supplementary Table 1). Two
17

470

exceptions are at rank 10 and 32, which return a result significant to p < 0.05, but no lower.

471

The implication of this specific finding is not straightforward to interpret. The high p-values

472

suggest this is an artefact of the underlying data, particularly in the latter case, as only three

473

groups contain 32 earthworks or more. Overall, it can be suggested that the earthwork groups

474

defined through point pattern analysis are far from hierarchically distributed in terms of their

475

size. While the construction of individual earthworks may have been guided by people with

476

the knowledge or authority to do so, there is little evidence at present that centralised control

477

structured the monumental landscape of Acre, either between or within clusters, over time. This

478

has broad-ranging implications for interpreting the formation of this archaeological landscape.

479
480

5. The structure and organisation of geometric earthworks

481

Pärssinen et al. (2009) cautioned a decade ago that archaeologists are only just beginning to

482

understand the earthwork builders of the Amazon, and at the time estimated that no more than

483

10% of all sites in the western Amazon had been documented. Far fewer have ever been visited

484

by an archaeologist. Findings such as those presented here are therefore understood to be

485

subject to testing with field data. The approach is deliberately couched in the language of

486

probability, examining problems in Amazonian archaeology in the light of a formalised model-

487

testing approach. This paper has demonstrated that archaeological hypotheses on geometric

488

earthworks are informative and appropriate for direct statistical scrutiny, an increasingly

489

prominent practice in the humanities more broadly (Epstein 2006; Kohler and Van der Leeuw

490

2007) and in landscape archaeology specifically (Bevan et al. 2013). This procedure estimated

491

the relative importance of known variables and detected conditions under which they do not

492

apply, which were controlled for through further testing. Bearing in mind our nascent

493

understanding of western Amazonian societies, the methods provide a rigorous point of

494

departure for extensions and alternative approaches in future work. Social dynamics, whether

495

vertical or horizontal, may be theorised on extensively, but ultimately must be subjected to

496

rigorous scrutiny if they are to improve our understanding of the past (Smith and Schrieber

497

2005: 205).

498
499

In this regard, ‘complexity’ in the abstract is frequently invoked to frame the emergence and

500

endurance of earthwork building as a cultural practice across the Neotropics (Roosevelt 1999;

501

Stahl 2002; Balée and Erickson 2006; Heckenberger and Neves 2009; De Souza et al. 2018),

502

however, operationalising a common definition and testing it in formal, comparative terms has

503

been less forthcoming (Smith and Schreiber 2005). Reflecting on this broader issue of model
18

504

testing in lowland South America, this paper has argued that archaeological accounts of human-

505

environmental relations would benefit from the systematic application of computational

506

methods. The approach advocated here is not antithetical to frameworks that emphasise the

507

dynamics of social behaviour or political organisation, but build usefully upon existing

508

hypothesis with complementary, probabilistic analytical tools. Point process modelling enables

509

multiple effects to be directly integrated in explanatory frameworks (McMichael et al. 2014a;

510

2014b). Statistically informative gains were achieved through a synthesis of model terms that

511

encapsulated both first- and second-order interaction within the material record. The former

512

class of effects collectively reflected consistent elements of geometric earthwork

513

configurations in relation to the landscape, while the latter stood in as a proxy for potential

514

social processes guiding the placement of these monuments in relation to one another.

515

Achieving a multifactorial fit to data in this manner demonstrates that archaeological models

516

expressed in plain language are tractable to robust statistical analysis. Formal simulation-based

517

models of complex archaeological realities are useful in drawing out salient elements of the

518

material record at the landscape scale (Wobst 1974; Lake 2015), and ought to be standard. This

519

paper provides a point of departure for further advances in point process modelling

520

(Supplementary Information), for example of other traditions of earthwork building among

521

the indigenous societies of pre-Columbian South America (Arnold and Prettol 1988;

522

Heckenberger et al. 1999; Roosevelt 1999; Prümers et al. 2006; Walker 2008; Lombardo and

523

Prümers 2010; Prümers 2014; De Souza et al. 2018).

524
525

Although it appears unlikely that time-transgressive or ascribed political status was a factor in

526

behind the construction of geometric earthworks, their distribution and groupings may instead

527

reflect other aspects of society in the pre-Columbian period, as well as biogeographical factors

528

(McMichael et al. 2014a; Watling et al. 2017). Bearing in mind the link that has repeatedly

529

been made between labour mobilisation and earthwork size, it can be tentatively suggested that

530

a demographic dimension to their distribution and degree of elaboration may exist. As noted in

531

the introduction, the period of geometric earthwork construction spans some two millennia. If

532

a certain degree of population fluctuation is assumed over such a lengthy time span, the

533

interplay between population growth and contraction would suggest, in theory, that the

534

presence of larger sites simply reflects there being more people to mobilise at a given point in

535

time, and smaller sites the reverse. On the other hand, Saunaluoma and Virtanen (2015: 36) do

536

not believe there is an association between increased geometric earthwork elaboration and the

537

advance of time. This link therefore remains somewhat conjectural, and its confirmation or
19

538

rejection ought to rest on far more extensive sampling of radiocarbon data from both

539

monumental sites and the few settlement sites that are known in the western Amazon. Future

540

investigations may also benefit from direct estimates of other geometric earthwork parameters,

541

such as the energetics involved in construction: berm height, ditch depth, total volume of soil

542

movement, and/or new indices of architectural complexity. Such variables, should they be

543

collected, could prove informative in renewed modelling efforts and permutation testing.

544

Additionally, the acquisition of high-resolution chronometric data would enable spatio-

545

temporal point process models to be fitted to archaeological patterns, turning the type of

546

analysis developed here from synchronic to diachronic (Baddeley and Turner 2005).

547

Extensions of the pair-correlation function that test for patterning among categorical subsets of

548

points, usually termed bi- or multi-variate spatial statistics would directly address phenomena

549

such as the reported cline in geometric earthwork morphology identified by Schaan (2012)

550

along a north-south axis.

551
552

Returning to the present research: the combined model highlighted hereto-unrecognised spatial

553

structure among geometric earthworks in Acre. Further examination of these patterns with the

554

simulation and permutation testing enabled specific inferences on the types of societies that

555

likely lived in this part of western Amazonia during the Late Holocene. Second, in a broader

556

methodological and theoretical scope, the analysis provided valuable insight into the

557

development of spatial analytical approaches in indigenous Amazonian contexts. The basic

558

null model (Fig. 3) illustrates that statistically significant clustering and dispersion occurs

559

between geometric earthworks at a variety of ranges. Furthermore, the additional controls on

560

the observed pattern (Fig. 2, Table 1) produced major insights into where the significant,

561

“extraordinary” patterns are in the data. Armed with this knowledge, we can affirm that

562

analysis at arbitrary spatial scales would fail to capture the diversity of the archaeological point

563

pattern. The results make it clear that fixed-scale summary statistics under a null assumption

564

of spatial homogeneity will not succeed in adequately describing data that are spatial

565

palimpsests (Davies et al. 2016). With reference to the study of “complexity”, a pervasive

566

rhetorical device in the archaeology of the Amazon basin, there are clear benefits to using

567

analytical strategies that can detect and account for non-linear interactions of this nature at

568

multiple spatial scales.

569
570

On one level, the findings presented here suggest that stratified or ranked societies are unlikely

571

to have been behind the construction of groups of geometric earthworks in western Amazonia.
20

572

Patterning within groups, whose definition is derived through robust inference, is more

573

evocative of non-hierarchical societies. It follows that interactions between groups of

574

earthwork-builders may have transiently expressed localised authority, materialised through

575

place-making practices in the form of geometric earthworks (Saunaluoma and Virtanen 2015).

576

Emergent forms of political control, in Acre as in many places in the world, were likely

577

historically variable and actively negotiated (Furholt et al. 2019). Ultimately, however, the

578

establishment of such relationships were not necessarily leveraged to form time-transgressive,

579

top-down political control over extended social groups. This accords with theory (Crumley

580

1979, 1995) and the archaeological record of Acre, which has thus far not produced evidence

581

typically associated with assigned social rank, such as structured access to resources, elite

582

burials, or as established here, a clear site hierarchy. Tentatively, an absence of centralised

583

control at any scale may also explain the diversity of geometric earthwork shapes, degree of

584

elaboration (Saunaluoma et al. 2018), and probably cluster size too. Anthropic changes to

585

vegetation community structure are evident at a landscape level in Acre since at least 4000 cal

586

BP, with major alterations to the relative abundance of comestible and economically useful

587

species (Watling et al. 2017, 2018). Without falling into unhelpful dichotomies between

588

intentional niche construction versus accidental forest enrichment, I note that evidence for

589

systematic, coordinated efforts at environmental modification is also lacking in Acre

590

(McMichael et al. 2012; Watling et al. 2017). This contrasts with neighbouring regions of

591

Amazonia, where both social stratification and large-scale labour coordination are reported in

592

association (Erickson 2006; Lombardo and Prümers 2010; Prümers and Jaimes Betancourt

593

2014). Despite the relative geographic proximity of geometric earthworks to other, diverse

594

earthmoving cultures of the Llanos de Moxos, their different organisational trajectories caution

595

against over-generalising the drivers and mechanisms behind the formation of extensive pre-

596

Columbian built environments without accounting for local trajectories first. In closing, the

597

observed diversity in their configurations and spatial structure likely possesses a chronological

598

element, as well as cultural and possibly demographic dimensions. These issues, highlighted

599

by the fitted point process models presented here, can only be resolved through further

600

excavation and recovery of data on their life histories.
