Abstract
An exploratory analysis of the labour insertion of Pedagogy students from the
University of Malaga belonging to the groups of 2009-10 and 2013-14 is presented. Data
from 180 students, provided by the Quality Unit of the University of Malaga, were used. As
an indicator of labor insertion, social security affiliation has been used. An Exploratory
Single-Case Evaluation design was carried out. A graphic comparison of the trend in both
groups has also been developed. Findings show a progressive soft tendency to access.

Resumen
Se presenta un análisis exploratorio de la inserción laboral de estudiantes de
Pedagogía de la Universidad de Málaga pertenecientes a los grupos de 2009-10 y 2013-14. Se
utilizaron datos de 180 estudiantes, proporcionados por la Unidad de Calidad de la
Universidad de Málaga. Como indicador de inserción laboral, se ha utilizado la afiliación a la
seguridad social. Se llevó a cabo un diseño exploratorio de evaluación de un solo caso.

También se ha desarrollado una comparación gráfica de la tendencia en ambas cohortes. Los
resultados muestran una tendencia suave progresiva para acceder.

Introduction
Pedagogy suffers a lack of definition in the labour market. As other degrees, as
Psychology, Sociology, or Universal Studies, Pedagogy has not clear which jobs their
graduates can conduct. Sometimes, this is interpreted an advantage because no limits are
defined; but as disadvantage too, because of the student must discover their own way of
access to the labour market.
The aim of this study is to know how long graduated studied waited up to access to a
job. Another aim was the comparison between two historical moments, one of them in middle
of the economic crisis (2009) and another at the end of the worst period (2013).

Method
Participants
Participants consisted of degrees in Pedagogy at University of Málaga, in 2009-2010
course (n=115) and 2013-2014 course (n=65) from University of Málaga. No
sociodemographic information, such as the proportion of male vs female, age or years
studying are available.

Data are from Unity of Quality of the University of Málaga. These data are the
proportion of incorporation to the labour market for graduated pedagogues in 2009-10 course
and those graduated in 2012-14. That means, that for every year the non-cumulative
proportion of new jobs is gathered. They can be interpreted as years that graduated people
spend until getting a job.

Design
A Single Case Exploratory Evaluation (SCEE) design was conducted. This research
methodology is based on Single Case Research (SCR) methodology that uses a unit of
analysis measured repeatedly over time.

Process and analysis
The SCEE procedure is very closed to the analysis development. So, both are
presented together. Phases for SCEE are following:
•

Initially, a visual longitudinal graph analysis from the temporal data series is
conducted. The aim is to identify a cut, a sudden change, in the graph. Then, one side
is considered stage A and the other as B. If more than one cut is identified, there are
considered so many stages as it is needed, but they will be analyzed in pairs.

•

Secondly, a non-overlap measured is developed, such as NAP, TAU or another one
(Vannest, Parker, Gonen & Adiguzel, 2016). Then, with that measure, the differences
between stages are analyzed.

•

Eventually, if statistical differences are found, a strategy to figure out the cause could
be unfolded. It could be any strategy, qualitative as well as quantitative approach.

In this case, a SCEE procedure and a visual analysis comparison between graphs as

well were conducted. The non-overlap measured developed was the TAU-U by Vannes,
Parker, Gonen & Adiguzel (2016).

Results
A visual analysis of figure 1 shows a different shape before and after 2013. Then,
years 2011 to 2013 were taken as stage A, and all the other as stage B.

A TAU-U non-overlap measure was conducted. Table 1 shows that there are
significant statistical differences between stage A and B when corrected baseline is not taken
into account (TAU-U= 1; Z= 1.964; p=.049) but not when it is (TAU-U= 0.888; Z= 1.745;
p=.080).

Because there is no statistical differences between stages, only a regression line was
calculated. The regression equation indicates a progressive increase of tendency, as is shown
in expresion 1.
y= 0.038x + 0.409

(Equation 1)

On the other hand, the proportion of graduating from the course of 2013-14 was 0.375
in 2015 and 0.450 in 2016. The difference of 0.075 points is observed in figure 2.

Conclusions
The present brief study analyzes the access trend to labour market from two groups of
graduated in Pedagogy. Findings show a soft positive trend of insertion for both groups.
Although initially were identified two stage in the temporal data series, statistical test
suggests it cannot be supported.
Nevertheless, the progressive incorporation of graduated to the labour market from
the 2009-10 group is coherent with the increasing recorded from the 2013-14 group from
2015 to 2016.
As a main conclusion, it could be said that more years for a job, more likely of
accessing. So, the access to the labour market for a Pedagogue depends on the time. Future
research should investigate how pedagogue invests that time: only waiting for, taking
experience, or taking training too.
Unfortunately, data show a bad news too: less than 70% of Pedagogist access to the
labour market, even after 6 years. That is a long time and a very small proportion. This
picture worth a deep reflexion by stakeholders and more researching to discover causes.
