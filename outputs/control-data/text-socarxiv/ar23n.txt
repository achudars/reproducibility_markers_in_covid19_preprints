Abstract
This study aims to tackle an answer to the main question; if there is a relationship between the
vocabulary size of adult English language learners and their morphological awareness and if their
performance would differ in word complexity. The participants were 90 senior BA English
Language and Literature students from Jordanian universities. The two empirical research tools
were the Vocabulary Size Test and Morphological Awareness Test. The results revealed the midfrequent level vocabulary size of the participants, and they were unable to form and use new words
using morphemes. A positive correlation between the vocabulary size of the participants and their
morphological awareness existed. Besides, a positive relationship existed between their
performance on word complexity and their morphological knowledge. Pedagogical solutions need
to be implanted in English as a Second Language (ESL)/ English as a Foreign Language (EFL)
classes.

Morphological Awareness and Vocabulary Knowledge

1. Introduction
Vocabulary is a fundamental linguistic element that affects language learning; as limited
vocabulary knowledge has always been a source of lexical disfluency for second or foreign
language learners. As maintained by Zimmerman (2005), a strong significant relationship exists
between the vocabulary size of language learners and their language competency. Lack of adequate
vocabulary is one of the main obstacles that ESL/EFL students encounter, which obstructs their
text comprehension (Levine & Reves, 1990). Read (2004) adds that a sufficient number of
acquired lexical items lead to good language production.
Thus, an essential part of language learning is language learning strategies used by L2
learners to improve their learning process (Cohen, 2007; Oxford, 2002). Vocabulary learning
strategies applied by ESL/EFL learners are regarded as learning strategies. Vocabulary learning
strategies are strategies employed by language learners to acquire, to retain, to regain, and to use
vocabulary (O’Malley & Chamot, 1995; Schmitt, 200; Schmitt &, McCarthy, 1997). Schmitt
(1997) indicates that second language (L2) learners could enhance their vocabulary when they are
directed to use vocabulary learning strategies in learning a language. The sources for language
learners to learn new words are the morphology and context according to Carlisle (2007).
Morphological awareness is considered a metalinguistic tool for learners to use words
effectively (Scott & Nagy, 2004). Yücel-Koç (2015) classifies morphological awareness as a
subdivision of metalinguistic knowledge. The use of morphological awareness is one possible
vocabulary learning strategy applied by ESL/EFL learners as it enhances their lexical knowledge
(Wysocki & Jenkins, 1987). Such knowledge can be developed when they become familiar with
word-formation to implement morphological processing, which is adding affixes (prefixes or
suffixes) to base words. Several studies have recommended the use of morphological clues as
decoding the parts of new words by ESL/EFL students to help them understand the meaning of
new words (McBride-Chang et al. 2005; Morin, 2003; Nation, 2001). With the intention of
learning and developing the vocabulary of ESL/EFL students, specific attention has to be paid to
the use of morphological awareness. As well, morphological awareness will enhance in reading
and understanding academic vocabulary by English language learners (Kieffer & DiFelice Box,
2013; Yücel-Koç, 2015; Crosson et al., 2018).
Morphological awareness implies a conscious knowledge of the skill of using free or bound
morphemes a of language, in addition to derivational and inflectional morphemes (Deacon &
Kirby 2004; Deacon, Kirby, & Casselman-Bell, 2009; Kirby et al., 2012; Kuo and Anderson,
2006). When ESL/EFL learners are aware of English inflectional morphology, this improves their
grammatical accuracy. Besides, their awareness of English derivational morphology will promote
their lexical knowledge. Koda and Zehler (2008) consider morphological awareness a part of
language learners’ comprehension of new words by fragmenting complex words into their
meaningful parts and assembling their meaningful parts into the new lexicon. As maintained by
Kuo and Anderson (2006), morphological awareness resembles language learners’ knowledge of
the process of words formation of a particular language. For example, when English language
learners recognize the word development is formed of two morphemes (develop, base word, and
the suffix -ment meaning the action or result of), subsequently, they will be able to form new
lexical items such as retirement, establishment, and abandonment by adding the suffix -ment to

base words. Consecutively, their comprehension of new words can influence their understanding
of reading texts and writing in that language. Several studies have concluded that morphological
awareness might be a cornerstone in first language L1 and L2 vocabulary development and reading
(see Kuo & Anderson, 2006; Zhang & Koda, 2012). Considerable studies have investigated the
practical relationship between morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge of nativespeaking children (see Carlisle & Fleming, 2003; McBride-Chang et al., 2005).
2. Review of Related Literature
Several studies determined that morphological awareness is an indicator of some language abilities
which include reading abilities (see Deacon & Kirby, 2004; Kuo & Anderson, 2006), writing skills
(see Qian, 2002), and vocabulary growth (see Nagy & Anderson, 1984; Wysocki & Jenkins, 1987).
The following section will shed light on a few studies which examined the relationship between
morphological awareness of first language or second language learners and their vocabulary
growth or size.
First, Bertram, Laine, and Virkkla (2000) investigated the morphological role of learning
vocabulary by Finnish elementary school children. They concluded that the more frequent Finnish
elementary school children learned affixes, their vocabulary developed more, and they were able
to discover the meanings of words.
Next is the study of Wysocki and Jenkins (1987). It examined the ability of school children
of 5 , 6th, and 8th grades to use their vocabulary knowledge of morphological analysis to
comprehend L1 complex lexical items. The researchers provided the students with a practice
session two weeks before they took the test. The first group applied morphological analysis to
learn words, while the second group learned words without implementing any morphological
analysis strategy. They found that students who applied morphological analysis in learning
vocabulary achieved better results than the other party who did not implement the strategy.
Additionally, the first party was able to comprehend meanings of new words by morphological
speculation of those words having the same roots.
th

As for Iranian English language learners, Khodadoust et al. (2013) investigated the
relationship between vocabulary knowledge and morphological awareness of 89 undergraduate
students studying English Translation. The scholars utilized two measuring tools: The Vocabulary
levels Test by Nation (1990) to measure the vocabulary size of the participants and the
Morphological Awareness Test by McBride-Chang et al. (2005) to measure their morphological
awareness. They found a positive correlation between their participants’ vocabulary size and
morphological awareness. They recommended some pedagogical recommendations such as
language instructors using morphological analysis in helping students learning vocabulary in the
classroom. Besides, as the outcomes indicated the positive effect of morphological awareness on
the growth of the participants’ vocabulary, so it was recommended to include morphological
activities in textbooks. Language instructors have to include the systemic and analytic aspects of
morphological awareness in the classes to increase the students’ vocabulary and morphological
knowledge. On the other hand, they suggested more research to be conducted to investigate the
difference in language learning performance between male and female in language learners.

Morphological Awareness and Vocabulary Knowledge

Akbulut (2017) examined the connection between morphological awareness and lexical
knowledge of 52 Turkish university students attending ESL introductory classes. The students
were divided into experimental group and control group. Both groups took a pre-test which
consisted of Nation’s (2001) Vocabulary Levels Test and Morphological Awareness Test, Part 1.
After 12 weeks of vocabulary teaching for both groups, they took a post-test of the Vocabulary
Levels Test and Morphological Awareness Test, Part 2. The experimental group was instructed
for three hours per week morphological knowledge and morphological analysis of lexical items.
Whereas, the control group was instructed for three hours of regular vocabulary teaching methods
as memorizing strategies and using dictionaries. Based on the outcomes, a significant positive
correlation existed between morphological awareness and vocabulary size of the participants. The
experimental group scored higher on the tests than the control group after 12 weeks of
morphological instruction. This outcome signifies that morphological awareness can motivate
students and help them to learn English vocabulary.
Long and Rule (2004) and Alsaeedi’s (2017) conclusions were the same as Akbulut’s
(2017). Their outcomes revealed that ESL/EFL learners could develop their lexical knowledge by
using morphological analyses as opposed to regular vocabulary teaching methodologies.
Although limited research conducted with Arab ESL or EFL learners, the relationship
between morphological analysis and vocabulary knowledge has been revealed. Al Farsi’s (2008)
study deducted the inverse of this relationship. It inspected the relationship between vocabulary
knowledge and morphological awareness among 54 Omani EFL undergraduate students. The
testing instruments were the Vocabulary Levels Test by Nation (2001) and the Morphological
Awareness Test by McBride-Chang et al. (2005). The findings showed that there was no
relationship between the participants’ vocabulary knowledge and their morphological awareness.
Moreover, the vocabulary size and morphological awareness of the participants were limited.
Conversely, Alsaeedi’s (2017) study concerning Saudi EFL undergraduate students and Yasin and
Jawad (2015) regarding Iraqi EFL postgraduate students revealed the association between the
vocabulary knowledge of the students and their morphological awareness.
Several studies have exhibited a positive association between vocabulary knowledge and
morphological awareness. There is a deficiency in the literature regarding the lack of studies
conducted on Jordanian ESL or EFL learners. Moreover, no study was found using the Vocabulary
Size Test (Nation & Beglar, 2007) to measure the vocabulary knowledge and size of students as
this utilized in this study.
3. Purpose of the Study
Research has divulged the significance of morphological awareness in enhancing the vocabulary
knowledge of language learners (See Carlisle, 2010; McBride-Chang et al., 2005; Morin, 2003;
Schiff & Calif, 2007). As stated by Carlisle (2010), "students do become more able to infer the
meanings of unfamiliar words after receiving instruction in morphological analysis" (p. 466).
There is a correlation between morphological awareness and learners’ lexical development due to
morphological awareness that involves recognition of the words' meaning and orthography;
consequently, learners will be able to identify words inevitably (McBride-Chang et al., 2008;

Zhang & Koda 2012). Moreover, morphological awareness contributes significantly to L1
vocabulary knowledge, according to Yücel-Koç (2015).
Nevertheless, not many studies have been executed on the impact of morphological
awareness on vocabulary in L2 learning (see Akbulut, 2017; Migel, 2012; Yücel-Koç, 2015; Zhang
& Koda, 2012). Hence, there is a need for more examinations to delve into the role of
morphological awareness in expanding vocabulary in L2. The purpose of the present study is to
inspect the relationship between adult English foreign language learners’ morphological awareness
and their respective vocabulary size. The findings are expected to provide valuable pedagogical
implementations to improve vocabulary learning at the university level.
4. Research Questions
This research is an attempt to answer the main question of the study: Is there a relationship between
the morphological awareness of BA students from Jordanian universities studying English
Language and Literature and their vocabulary knowledge?
The research questions addressed in this study are:
1. What is the English vocabulary size of the participants of the study?
2. What level of English morphological awareness do these participants possess?
3. Is there a relationship between the participants’ English morphological awareness and their
English vocabulary size?
4. Does English morphological awareness differentiate between the participants’
performance on the complex word and simple words of the VST?
5. Methodology
5.1. Participants
The participants of this study were senior university students from three private Jordanian
universities studying BA English Language and Literature. The participants were 90 students
chosen randomly from third and fourth-year students. The participants' age ranged between 19 and
25, and all were native Arabic speakers and had been learning English as a foreign language for at
least 12 years. The participants’ gender was not considered although 18 males and 72 females
students were represented in the study. They were tested in their universities in the First Term of
the 2018-2019 academic year.
5.2. Research Instruments
Two tests were applied to answer the research questions of the study. The first test was the
Vocabulary Size Test (Nation & Beglar, 2007). It was adapted as it is widely used, and it functions
reliably and constantly, and its results are easy to score and interpret. The second test was the
Morphological Awareness Test with its two subtests: The Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic
Aspect) and the Morphemes Identification Test (Analytic Aspects) (McBride-Chang et al., 2005).
5.2.1. The Vocabulary Size Test
With the aim to assess the participants’ vocabulary size, the Vocabulary Size Test (VST) by Nation
and Beglar (2007) was utilized. The test measures the vocabulary size of English language learners
based on 14,000-word families extracted from the British National Corpus. Beglar (2010)
validated the test using Rasch analysis based on Messick’s (1995) validation framework.

Moreover, the test is a reliable measuring instrument of the vocabulary size of non-native speakers
of English (Beglar, 2010; Nation & Beglar, 2007). Although the English monolingual version of
the test has gained momentum, the bilingual versions of it have been extensively utilized. The
multiple-choice options of the items are in the native language of test-takers such as Japanese,
Russian, Vietnamese, Mandarin, and Persian. (See Elgort, 2013; Karami, 2012; Nguyen & Nation
2011; Stewart, 2009; Zhao & Ji, 2016).
The VST consists of 14 vocabulary frequency level, composing of 140 multiple-choice
items, with ten from each 1,000-word family level. The frequency levels are arranged in frequency
order; the first 1000-word level comprises the most frequent word families, and the 14,000-word
level contains the least frequent word families. The total vocabulary size of a learner is obtained
by multiplying the overall score of a learner by 100.
The VST is an applicable diagnostic test used by language instructors to identify the
vocabulary size of their students and which word-frequency level they need to target. Furthermore,
the test is useful for research purposes to measure total written vocabulary size for learners of the
English language (Beglar, 2010; Nation & Beglar, 2007; Nguyen & Nation, 2011).
The VST used in the present study was modified by having half of the items (five items)
complex words, and the other half simple words at each level. The reason for this was to inspect
the relationship between morphological awareness and the participants’ performance in simple
words versus complex ones. Complex words are created by adding some morphemes to test items.
5.2.2. Morphological Awareness Test
The Morphological Awareness Test by McBride-Chang et al. (2005) was used to test the
participants’ morphological knowledge. This test is composed of two parts: Morpheme
Identification Awareness Test (Analytic Aspects) and Morphological Structural Awareness Test
(Synthetic Aspects).
5.2.2.1. Morpheme Identification Test (Analytic Aspect)
The Morphemes Identification Test gauges the participants’ ability to analyze and break down
complex words into smaller units, for example, adulthood = adult + hood. In the present study,
the participants were given 13 decontextualized items that were diverged from the items of the
original Morpheme Identification Test to harmonize with the participants' age. The participants
were asked to write the meaning of each morpheme. Then they were required to segment the words
into as many smaller meaningful units as they can identify in each word. The words were out of
context as to restrict the potential influence of context in guessing the meanings of words. The
morphemes were neutral, in terms of no phonological and orthographical changes were caused to
the stem.
The total score of Morpheme Identification Test is 33: three inflectional affixes, 13
derivational affixes, 17 stems in total. The overall score stands for the maximum number of
possible morphemes in the test item.

5.2.2.2. Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect)
The Morphological Structure Test measures students’ morphological ability to synthesize
morphemes to produce new words. For instance, the word write could be attached to many
morphemes, such as writer, writing, and rewrite. A modified version of the Morphological
Structure Test was used to make the test more appropriate for university students. The test consists
of 14 items: nine inflectional affixes, three derivational affixes, and 23 stems. The items are
embedded in a sentence frame to inspect two elements: First, the students’ level of awareness of
lexical structure, second to inspect the relationships between words and how words relate to each
other in a sentence. The participants were required to use the frame sentence to create a new word
to complete the next sentence.
The total score of Morphological Structure Test is 35 points that signify the maximum
number of possible morphemes in the test item.
5.3. Data Collection Procedure
The participants of the study were 90 BA students of English Language and Literature from three
Jordanian universities. Data were collected in the participants’ classes during the third week of
the first term of the 2018-2019 academic year. The tests were carried out on different days to
minimize fatigue. The Vocabulary Size Test was administered first to determine the participants’
vocabulary size. After two days, The Morphological Awareness Test, with its two subtests (The
Morphemes Identification Test and the Morphological Structure Test) were administered to inspect
the participants’ morphological analytic and synthetic abilities. The participants were instructed
for each test, and there was no time limit for the participants to complete the tests.
5.4. Data Analysis
The descriptive statistics and corresponding correlations were used to analyze the quantitative
collected data of this study. Mean and standard deviation are used to summarize: the results of the
Morpheme Identification Test, the Morphological Structure Test, and the Vocabulary Size Test.
Spearman’s rho was used for the collected data to assess: First, the students’ morphological
knowledge. Second, the relationship between the students’ vocabulary size and their
morphological awareness. Finally, to find if the morphological awareness differentiates between
the students’ performance on complex versus simple words.
6. Results
6.1. Vocabulary Size Test
The VST consists of fourteen levels in which each level comprises of ten items, making the overall
number of items 140 and the total score is 140 points. The Kuder-Richardson 21(KR-21) formula
was applied in assessing the reliability of the total items of the VST (140 items), which the
reliability value is 0.812 (α = 0.812). This result indicates that the test is a reliable measuring
instrument of vocabulary size. The first question of the research was answered based on the
students’ performance on the VST.
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the students’ mean scores for the VST on each
level. It displays a decline in the students’ mean scores from level 1 to level 14. The highest mean

scores were for the first level (M= 8.65) and the second level (7.47) as those are the highest
frequency words in English. Whereas the lowest mean score (M= 0.64) was for the 14,000 words
because they are the least frequently used words in English. The students attained higher mean
scores for the first seven levels (level 1 – level 7) and lower mean scores for the second seven
levels (level 8 – level 14). In general, the mean scores decreased from the first seven levels to the
next second seven levels. Accordingly, students perform better on the higher frequency words
than the lower frequency words, as they are acquainted with high-frequency words more often.

knowledge of 100 word-families. The students’ mean scores on the test were multiplied by 100 to
estimate the vocabulary size at each level. The total vocabulary size that makes the overall
vocabulary size of the students is 5,565 word-families (students’ vocabulary size falls within this
level).
6.2. Morphological Awareness Test
Morphological Awareness Test is divided into two sub-tests: The Morpheme Identification Test
(Analytic Aspect) and Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect). The reliability of the
morphological awareness tests was calculated by using Cronbach’s alpha, as presented in Table 2.
The reliability of the Morphological Awareness Test of the total test items (27 items) inclusive of
both subtests was 0.881 (α = 0.881) indicating that the test is reliable. The coefficient reliability
for both subtests was obtained separately by using Cronbach’s alpha. The Analytic Aspect was
reliable at 0.853(α = 0.853), and the Synthetic Aspect was reliable at 0.901 (α = 0.901). In general,
the students’ scores in the Morphological Awareness Test are reliable.

To answer the second research question to determine the degree of the students’ morphological
knowledge, descriptive statistics for the mean scores obtained from the students’ performances on
the Morphological Awareness Test with its two sub-tests: The Morpheme Identification Test
(Analytic Aspect) and Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect).
As for a general comparison between the students’ scores of the Morpheme Identification
Test (Analytic Aspect) and their scores of the Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect),
their mean scores indicate a significant difference between their results in both tests as it is
represented in Table 3. There was a significant difference in the scores for the Morpheme
Identification Test (Analytic Aspect) (M=23.87, SD=7.34) and the scores of the Morphological
Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect) (M= 17.86, SD= 10.26). The overall mean score of the
Morphological Awareness Test was 41.21 out of 68 with a significant dispersion among the results
(SD= 11.79), which implies that the students have intermediate awareness of word formation rules.
The findings have shown that the students’ morphological awareness was medium (69%).

The results of Table 4 show a direct and significant relationship between the scores of
students on the Analytic Aspect and their scores on the Synthetic Aspect. It can be noticed that the
correlation index was very significant (r = 0.651, p < 0.05); it represents a positive correlation
between analytic knowledge and synthetic knowledge.

The students’ knowledge of inflectional, derivational affixes, and stems were obtained to
gain more perception of the students’ morphological knowledge. One point was given for each
morpheme in this test, which makes the total score 68. The total number of morphemes were: three
inflectional affixes, 13 derivational affixes and 17 stems in the Analytic Aspect section, while three
derivational affixes, nine inflectional affixes and 23 stems in the Synthetic Aspect section.

It can be indicated from Table 5 that the students’ scores were better in inflectional affixes
in both the Analytic Aspect (M= 10.56, SD = 1.85) and Synthetic Aspect (M= 8.07, SD= 1.014)
than their scores in derivational affixes in the Analytic Aspect (M= 1.48, SD= 0.601) and Synthetic
Aspect (M= 1.53, SD= 0.623) of Morphological Awareness Test. Furthermore, the students’
performance was relatively good on the Synthetic Aspect stems (M= 15.58, SD= 2.961), and the
Analytic Aspect stems (M= 12.23, SD= 1.973) of the test.
6.3. Morphological Awareness Test and its Relationship to the Vocabulary Size Test
The correlation coefficient between the students’ morphological awareness and their vocabulary
size was calculated using Spearman’s rho to answer the third research question. The mean scores
of the VST, overall Morphological Awareness Test, and the two Morphological Awareness tests
for the students were correlated to measure the strength of association between the variables. The
significance of correlations is reported as a one-tail p-value as it is presumed that positive
relationships exist between morphological awareness and vocabulary size of the students. The
values of the correlation according to Ratner’s (2011) interpretation were interpreted as follows: 0
– 0.3 (weak), 0.3 – 0.7 (moderate), and 0.7 – 1.0 (strong).

The outcomes of Table 6 reveal that the Morphological Awareness Test, the Analytic, and
Synthetic Aspects were significantly correlated with the vocabulary size of the students. The
strength of association, however, was a moderate correlation (r = 0.571, 0.509, 0.461, p < 0.05).
The correlation of the Morpheme Identification Test (Analytic Aspect) and VST means (r= .571,
p < 0.05) was slightly higher compared to the Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect)
and the VST means (r= .509, p < 0.05). This outcome denotes that the two tests assessed different
kinds of morphological knowledge. `

Morphological Awareness and Vocabulary Knowledge

6.4. The Morphological Awareness Test and Complex vs. Simple Words on the VST
The students’ performance on the Morphological Awareness Test and their performance on simple
vs. complex words on the VST have been scrutinized to answer the fourth research question. Table
7 presents the descriptive statistics of the students' performance in simple vs. complex words of
the first seven levels and the second seven levels of the VST. The students obtained better average
scores in simple words than complex words, mainly at the first seven levels (M=10.25, SD= 2.68).
In in contrast, their lowest average scores were scored on complex words at the second seven levels
(M = 2.90, SD =2.61).

It can be deducted from Table 8 that a positive and significant correlation exists between
simple vs. complex words of the VST and the two subtests of the Morphological Awareness Test.
The students’ performance on simple words vs complex words at the first and second seven levels
is positively correlated with their performance on the Analytic and Synthetic Aspects. On the
whole, this significant association of the students’ performance on both subtests of the
Morphological Awareness Test make a distinction between their performance on simple vs.
complex words.
7. Discussion
The present study aims to detect the relationship between morphological awareness and the
vocabulary size of adult English foreign language learners. Four research questions were answered
to determine this relationship; the results of these questions are discussed in the following sections.
7. 1. Vocabulary Size
The first research question of the study regarding the students’ vocabulary size was investigated
using the Vocabulary Size Test (VST) by Nation and Beglar (2007). The test is available from the
following website www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/paul-nation. As indicated by Nation and
Meara (2002), a correlation exists between the number of words language learners know, as
measured by the vocabulary tests, and how well they present their reading, writing, and speaking
English abilities. Moreover, vocabulary size manipulates the types of reading material that
language learners can easily read. Laufer (1997) confirms that a lacking number of words in the
second language learner’s vocabulary comprises a hindrance to efficient reading.
The current students’ performance on the VST indicated that they performed better at the
first seven levels (1-7) than the second seven levels (8-14). Their performance was better on the
high-frequency words than the low-frequency words. The overall vocabulary size of the students
was 5,565-word families. According to Nation’s (2016) classification of frequency levels, their
vocabulary size can be considered as mid-frequent level. The three main frequency levels are
high-frequency level (1000-2000 word families), mid-frequency level (3000-9000 word families),
and low-frequency level (10000 on word families).
Nation and Beglar (2007) imply that the outcomes of earlier studies utilized the VST
disclosed the vocabulary size of 5,000- 6,000-word families of undergraduate non-native English
speakers studying at English-speaking universities. Likewise, non-native postgraduate (Ph.D.)
students need the vocabulary size of around 9,000 word-families. Such results denote that learners
need to obtain a specific vocabulary size before handling a text without difficulty. Hu and Nation
(2000), moreover, advise that learners need to be familiarized with 98% of the words in the text at
any level to understand it. Furthermore, Nation (2006) assumes that learners’ vocabulary size of
around 8,000- 9,000 word families is expected to achieve sufficient perception of 98% written text
coverage, and their vocabulary size of 6,000-7,000 word families is required to understand 98%
spoken coverage. Contrariwise, Laufer and Ravenhorst-Kalovski’s (2010) recommend two

distinctive lexical thresholds for the probable text coverage at which most learners can understand.
Learners’ vocabulary size of 8,000-9,000-word families is the ideal threshold to comprehend 98%
of written text coverage. Whereas their vocabulary size of around 5,000-word families is the
minimum threshold required to understand 95% of spoken coverage. However, the vocabulary size
needed for learners to understand conversational English is about 3,000- word families (Adolphs
& Schmitt, 2003). According to corpus-based studies, learners are required to acquire a large
vocabulary size for reading comprehension larger than what is needed for understanding listening
English. Additionally, less frequent vocabulary contributes to a nominal percentage of text
coverage (Nation, 2006; Stæhr, 2008).
Thinking about 98% coverage of text as indicated by corpus-based studies, the students’
vocabulary size in the present study demonstrates that their vocabulary size is below 8000- word
families necessitated for receptive tasks as understanding written texts. Considering the students’
limited vocabulary knowledge, they will not be able to handle and understand diversified
challenging oral and printed texts such as academic texts and novels. A demand for planned
teaching and learning and a variety of reading opportunities are required due to the students’
moderate vocabulary size. Students, therefore, need more prospects for learning vocabulary with
different frequency levels to improve their vocabulary knowledge as it is vital for their academic
achievements. As stated by Nation (2001), vocabulary learning strategies can be applied by
language instructors to start teaching language students high-frequency words and then progress
to low-frequency words.
The vocabulary size of students should be gauged with the purpose to detect the expected
number of words to accomplish essential assignments at the university level. Students need to
obtain good vocabulary size, so they will be able to understand and infer different written English
texts as a part of their study. Hence, increasing their vocabulary size should be their primary focus.
7.2. Morphological Awareness
The second research question of this study examined the students’ morphological awareness. The
answer to this question was based on the students’ performance on the Morphological Awareness
Test with its two subtests: The Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspects) and the
Morphemes Identification Test (Analytic Aspects) by (McBride-Chang et al., 2005).
The outcomes have revealed that the students’ overall morphological awareness was
medium (69%). This outcome demonstrates the students’ inadequate competency to deal with the
morphological structure of words. Language learner’s morphological awareness could be counted
as a good indicator of vocabulary knowledge (Goodwin et al., 2013; Mahnoosh et al., 2017;
McBride -Change et al., 2005). Besides, students performed better in the Analytic Aspect
(M=23.87) than they did in the Synthetic Aspect (M= 17.86). Their low performance in the
Synthetic Aspect exposes their incapability to use and form new words utilizing free and bound
morphemes. According to Bloom’s taxonomy- cognitive domain (1956), synthesis necessitates
more highly developed skills than analysis. Taking this into consideration, it explains the students’
low performance in the synthesizing morphological structure.

The students’ results were higher in inflectional affixes than their results in derivational
affixes in both subtests of Morphological Awareness Test. These results are incompatible with the
findings of the study by Varatharajoo et al. (2015). Such an outcome is in agreement with Carlisle
and Stone’s (2003) inference that points towards language learners’ acquisition of inflection before
their acquisition of derivation. As the students of this study were native Arabic speakers, the
typological differences between the Arabic language and the English language might have been a
reason for the students’ inability not being able to identify the morphological structure of complex
words.
Referring to the conception of cross-linguistic variation, the morphology of the Arabic
language might have caused the students' lack of ability to perceive the morphological structure of
English complex words. In the perspective of the fact that Arabic affixes and roots are bound
morphemes, then, complex Arabic words cannot be split into its meaningful constituents.
Considereing this fact, it might have influenced the students’ incapability to part English stems
from affixes, thereupon, they were incompetent to code obscure English complex words and were
unable to uncover the implications of new complex words.
The English morphological system is a linear or concatenative (Saiegh-Haddad & Geva,
2007) in which word formation employs a sequence of morphemes from the word (Kiraz, 2001).
For instance, the word “unthoughtful” is split into “un-”, “thought”, “-ful”. As stated by Al-Farsi
(2008), the morphological structure of English is regarded as a straightforward structure.
Contrastingly, the Arabic morphological system is a non-linear derivational process of a nonconcatenative language (Saiegh-Haddad & Geva, 2007). For example, the verb hit /ḍurib/ in the
past perfect tense is derived from the consonantal root /ḍ-r-b/ (the concept of hitting), and the
vocalic sequence /u-i/ used to indicate the past perfect tense. The concatenation of these
morphemes will not produce anticipated words if they are added indifferently. The inflection in
Arabic is formed by the concatenative process, whereas derivation occurs using a nonconcatenative process (Bhuyan & Ahmed, 2008).
Based on the prior mentioned findings of the Morphological Awareness Test, it is essential
to apply explicit teaching methodology of morphological instructions and morphological analysis
in EFL and ESL classes. Several studies have exhibited that morphological awareness results in
mastering oral and written language skills such as reading and writing (Mechta, 2016; Qian, 2002).
As maintained by several studies, students have demonstrated their ability in reckoning the
meanings of unknown words or complex words after being acquainted with morphological
analysis instruction (Gordon, 1989; Morin, 2003; Yücel-Koç, 2015; Zhang & Koda, 2012).
Morin’s research (2003) deduces that explicit teaching of morphological units enhances both
receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge of students as well as facilitating vocabulary
learning of unknown words. Another study was conducted by Varatharajoo et al. (2015) concludes
that training their 106 ESL secondary students inflectional and derivational morphemic analysis
awareness improved their students’ vocabulary learning strategies.

7.3. Vocabulary Size, Morphological Awareness and Complex vs. Simple Words on the VST
The third and fourth research questions tackled the probable relationship between the students’
vocabulary size and their morphological awareness, their accomplishment on the Morphological
Awareness Test, and their performance on simple vs. complex words on the VST.
It was assumed that a positive correlation would exist between the vocabulary size of the
students, as estimated by the VST, and their morphological awareness, as evaluated by the
Morphological Awareness Test. Additionally, a correlation would be found between the students’
morphological awareness and their performance on simple vs. complex words on the VST.
The results of the present research display a positive significant correlation between the
vocabulary size of the students and their morphological awareness. This result is in line with the
results of the study administered by McBride-Chang et al. (2005) that indicated a positive
significant correlation between their participants’ morphological awareness and vocabulary
grades.
It is noted that the correlation between the students’ vocabulary size and their performance
on the Morpheme Identification Test (Analytic Aspect) was to some extent higher than the
correlation between the students’ vocabulary size and their performance on the Morphological
Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect). This finding signifies that the two subtests of the Morphological
Awareness Test measured different types of morphological knowledge, and the students had
different performance on each test.
The fourth question of this study inspected the students’ performance on the Morphological
Awareness Test and their performance on simple vs. complex words on the VST. The outcomes
of the question show that the students’ performance on simple vs. complex words of the first seven
levels was higher than their performance on simple vs. complex words of the second seven levels
of the VST. This correlation indicates the students’ performance decreases as the word frequency
level of the VST decreases too. A significant positive relationship existed between the students’
performance on simple words vs complex words on the VST and their performance on the Analytic
and Synthetic Aspects.
This study highlighted the relationship between the students’ English vocabulary size and
their English morphological awareness and between the students’ English morphological
awareness and their performance on English words complexity. These focal points are congruent
with several pieces of research, such as Singson, Mahony, and Mann, 2000, and Sternberg, 1987.
8. Conclusion
The present study investigated the relationship between the vocabulary size of adult language
learners (senior students of BA English Language and Literature) and their morphological
awareness. The study inspected the possibility of a correlation between the students’ vocabulary
size and their morphological awareness and if their performance on the Morphological Awareness
Test would be different in word complexity (simple vs. complex words). Two empirical research
instruments were used to answer the research questions: The Vocabulary Size Test adapted from
Nation and Beglar (2007), and the Morphological Awareness Test with its two subtests: The

Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect) and the Morphemes Identification Test (Analytic
Aspects) modified from McBride-Chang et al. (2005).
The outcomes indicated that the students demonstrated medium overall morphological
awareness, which can be considered ineffective managing the morphological structure of words.
As for their achievement in word formation, they performed better in the Morpheme Identification
Test (Analytic Aspect) than the Morphological Structure Test (Synthetic Aspect). This result
reflects the students’ inability to form and use new words using free and bound morphemes.
Regarding their vocabulary size, the findings of the study revealed that their vocabulary size is
5,565 word-families (mid-frequent level size). They performed better on the high-frequency
words than the low-frequency words. Besides, they scored higher in simple words than complex
words on the VST.
To conclude, the findings of the study illuminated a positive correlation between the
vocabulary size of the students and their morphological awareness. The students’ morphological
awareness, moreover, correlated positively with their performance on simple vs. complex words
on the VST and their performance on the Analytic and Synthetic Aspects. These outcomes imply
a need for pedagogical implications to be implemented in ESL/EFL classes.
To improve the morphological awareness and vocabulary size of the students, explicit
teaching of morphological awareness in the classes has to be put into practice, in addition,
including morphological knowledge in the English language curriculum used in classes. Language
instructors can endorse diversity of morphological activities to help students to analyze and build
the morphological structure of new lexical items. Carlisle and Stone (2003) indicate that
morphological units can be used by language learners to know the meaning of words to improve
their lexical knowledge. Moreover, teaching students affixes will increase their vocabulary size as
stated by Baumann et al. (2003), and Kuo and Anderson (2006) and will improve their reading
comprehension due to the increase in their vocabulary knowledge according to Mechta (2016),
and Fowler et al. (1995).
The pedagogical insinuation of this study is that morphological awareness is essential for
vocabulary learning and vocabulary size of English language learners. Language instructors and
curriculum planners have to focus on using morphological knowledge and activities in the classes
of ESL/EFL due to their significance in learning English language skills as writing and reading in
addition to vocabulary learning and academic success.
Future research may investigate some aspects that were not taken into consideration in this
study. This study investigated the vocabulary size of the students, while other language skills such
as reading, or writing can be examined in future research. It would be useful if other factors were
considered in the study as age, gender, or learning motivations of the students.
