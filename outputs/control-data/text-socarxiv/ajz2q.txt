Community Mental Health Spillover Effects ∗

We reevaluate the claim from Bor et al. (2018) that “police killings of unarmed black Americans
have effects on mental health among black American adults in the general population” (p. 302). The
Mapping Police Violence data used by the authors includes 91 incidents involving black decedents
who were either (1) not killed by police officers in the line of duty or (2) armed when killed.
These incidents should have been removed or recoded prior to analysis. Correctly recoding these
incidents decreased in magnitude all of the reported coefficients, and, more importantly, eliminated
the reported statistically significant effect of exposure to police killings of unarmed black individuals
on the mental health of black Americans in the general population. We caution researchers to vet
carefully crowdsourced data that tracks police behaviors and warn against reducing these complex
incidents to overly simplistic armed/unarmed dichotomies.
Keywords: policing, mental health, deadly force, data validity

Introduction
In their study “Police Killings and their Spillover Effects on the Mental Health of Black Americans,” Bor et al. (2018) employed a quasi-experimental design to show that, from 2013 to 2016,
“each additional police killing of an unarmed black American was associated with 0.14 additional
poor mental health days among black American respondents [to the US Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System]” (p. 302). They extrapolate from this that police killings of unarmed black
Americans may cause as many as 55 million poor mental health days each year among black adults
in the US, an effect “nearly as large as the mental health burden associated with diabetes” (p. 308).
The study has received extensive scholarly, media, and social media attention. Published in The
Lancet, one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world (with an Impact Factor
of 59.1 in 2018), the study has been cited 184 times as of December 10, 2020. It received the highest “quality assessment” score among 11 studies included in a recent systematic review of evidence
concerning the relationship between police interactions and the mental health of black Americans
(McLeod et al., 2020). It has also received 193 news mentions (including Washington Post, USA

interactions according to PlumX Metrics.1
Bor et al.’s data on police killings were compiled by Mapping Police Violence (MPV), a research
collaborative operated by a team of racial justice activists. The research team sourced the data from
FatalEncounters.org, the U.S. Police Shootings Database, and KilledbyPolice.net, and then sought
supplementary information (e.g., searching social media, obituaries, criminal records databases,
police reports) to document additional details about each incident.2 We first expressed concern
about how MPV classifies police killings in correspondence published alongside Bor and colleagues’
study (Lozada & Nix, 2019). Specifically, we noted that MPV classifies many incidents as involving
“unarmed” individuals when in fact they were in possession of deadly weapons or toy guns that
might have appeared authentic to officers. Bor et al. (2019) were dismissive, stating “[a]lthough
some degree of misclassification of exposure is possible, it is improbable to have substantially
affected our estimates or conclusions” (p. 1413). They also referenced the police shooting of 12year-old Tamir Rice, seemingly holding it up as evidence that for their research question it was
not necessary to distinguish police killings of unarmed individuals from those of individuals armed
with toy guns. Shockingly, the authors opted not to revisit their data or verify the robustness of
their findings.3
In December 2019, Science Advances published a paper which employed a similar methodology
and purported to show a causal relationship between exposure to police killings of unarmed black
persons and low birth weight among black infants in California (Legewie, 2019). Within eight days,
the author retracted the paper. A reader had identified numerous shootings that were misclassified
as involving unarmed persons, and when the author promptly investigated and re-ran his statistical
models, he could not replicate his primary finding (American Association for the Advancement of
Science and others, 2019). Seeing how this unfolded, we grew concerned that the same could be
true of Bor et al. (2018).

Eventually, Bor et al. (2020) responded to the analyses we present in this paper by estimating 128 regression
models “reflecting all of the different exposure terms constructed from all combinations of omissions of the 7 categories
of cases” (see p. 6) that we dispute here. All point estimates were positive, though notably, 39% were statistically
non-significant. More important, their approach implies that all 128 combinations had construct validity. Many did
not, as we discuss below.

Analysis and Results
We reexamined all 303 police killings occurring from 2013 to 2016 which MPV classified as involving
an unarmed black victim. MPV defines police killings as “case[s] where a person dies as a result
of being chased, beaten, arrested, restrained, shot, pepper sprayed, tasered, or otherwise harmed
by police officers, whether on-duty or off-duty, intentional or accidental.” This is an extremely
broad definition, and indeed we identified 91 incidents (30% of all “unarmed black victims”) that
should have been removed or recoded prior to Bor et al.’s analysis. Table 1 summarizes these
misclassifications. Details for each incident are provided in Appendix A.
[Table 1 here]
First, 52 of Bor et al.’s “unarmed black victims” were not killed intentionally by on-duty police
officers. Seventeen died in vehicular crashes while fleeing officers. Another four died not while fleeing, but as a result of accidental vehicular collisions with police cruisers. Four were prison inmates
who died after fighting with other inmates or fighting with/being restrained by prison guards (i.e.,
not police officers). Fourteen were murdered by romantic partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or other individuals who were off-duty police or correctional officers. Finally, thirteen died
following interactions with police officers, but their deaths were not directly attributable to police
intervention. Sandra Bland, for example, committed suicide in a Texas jail three days after her
arrest (Dart, 2015). All 52 of these incidents should have been removed from Bor et al.’s analysis.
Another 13 individuals were killed intentionally by police officers in the line of duty but should
not have been classified as “unarmed.” For example, body camera footage shows Jason Harrison
advance toward two Dallas police officers at close range with a screwdriver in-hand just before the
officers shot him (Tsiaperas, 2016). Others tried to run over police officers with their vehicles or
nearly gained control of their service firearms while resisting arrest. These incidents should have
been coded as “armed” in Bor et al.’s analysis.
Finally, it is problematic to lump together police killings of unarmed individuals with those of
individuals who were in possession of toy/replica firearms or objects that might reasonably resemble
deadly weapons to officers in the moment. There were 26 such incidents included in Bor et al.’s
analysis. Consider the police shootings of 21-year-old Donovan Thomas in Missouri, or 27-year-old
3

Willie James Williams in Georgia – both of whom were robbery suspects armed with BB guns
that resembled real pistols. It is disingenuous to equate incidents like these with police killings of
individuals who neither had a weapon nor anything resembling a weapon. However, as Bor et al.
(2019) point out, such a distinction may not be necessary when considering the potential spillover
effect of police killings on the mental health of the general population. Accordingly, the most
reasonable analytic strategy is to analyze the data with these 26 individuals coded as unarmed and
then again with the same individuals coded as armed. In this way, the authors could check whether
their findings are sensitive to the coding of these controversial incidents.
We recalculated Bor et al. (2018)‘s models predicting their primary outcome, poor mental health
days, as well as their secondary outcomes, any poor mental health days and frequent mental distress,
using the corrected data. The results are displayed in Table 2 (primary outcome) and Table 3
(secondary outcomes). The authors’ original results are listed in the first column of each table, which
we were successfully able to replicate using the data and code they deposited online (Venkataramani,
2018). The second column of each table (Replication 1) provides results of the same analysis with
the 52 incidents involving individuals not intentionally killed by on-duty police officers dropped
and the 13 decedents wrongly coded as “unarmed” corrected to “armed.” In the third column of
each table (Replication 2), we re-coded an additional 26 individuals in possession of toy guns or
objects that reasonably resembled deadly weapons as “armed.”
[Tables 2 and 3 here]
Using the corrected data, we failed to replicate any of the results presented in Bor et al. (2018).
Effects were much smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant. Notably, this was the case
regardless of how we coded incidents involving individuals who possessed toy guns or objects that
may have resembled deadly weapons. In other words, even accepting at face value the assumption
that these incidents are perceived by the community as injustices on par with police killings of
unarmed individuals, there was not a statistically significant relationship between police killings of
unarmed black persons and the mental health of black Americans.

Conclusion
Bor et al.’s data, when correctly coded, do not support their conclusion that police killings of
unarmed black persons have “spillover effects” on the mental health of black Americans in the
general population. This was a landmark study, as it was the first to our knowledge that alleged
to demonstrate a causal relationship between “events widely perceived to reflect structural racism
and the mental health of black Americans” (p. 308). Since its publication, additional studies – also
relying heavily on crowdsourced data – have examined whether police killings of black Americans
are associated with other adverse health effects, including sexually transmitted diseases (Ibragimov
et al., 2020), preterm birth (Goin, 2019), and lower birth weight (Legewie, 2019; American Association for the Advancement of Science and others, 2019). As this important area of study grows,
researchers are challenged with navigating multiple databases that define police killings variably.
In light of our findings, we conclude with two points. First, researchers must exercise caution
when analyzing crowdsourced data on police killings – especially data compiled by activists who
may not view these incidents through an objective lens. Indeed, even the Pulitzer Prize winning
“Fatal Force” database compiled by The Washington Post has been criticized for miscoding armed
individuals as unarmed (Klinger & Slocum, 2017). At the very least, researchers must be attentive
to the language they use in light of the data they analyze. As but one example, it was inappropriate
for Bor and colleagues to claim in their Introduction that “police kill more than 300 black Americans
– at least a quarter of them unarmed – each year in the USA” (p. 302, emphasis added), given
there were many incidents in the data involving accidental deaths, deaths at the hands of nonpolice officers (or romantic partners/family members/neighbors who were off-duty police officers),
and individuals who were in fact armed.
Second, we must refrain from reducing deaths at the hands of police to whether the person
was armed or unarmed, as if this alone is a measure of the appropriateness of officer actions (Fyfe,
1986). Sometimes, officers appropriately use less-lethal force on individuals who die unexpectedly,
as was the case when an officer tased Dominique Franklin, Jr., who then hit his head on a light pole
and fell, and later died at the hospital (Sege, 2014). In Ohio, officers tased James Carney III who
had been punching, choking, and biting a woman while trying to rob her at an ATM. He became
unresponsive and later died (Brennan & Butts, 2015). Both of these individuals were treated as

5

unarmed black men killed by police officers in MPV. We opted not to recode these incidents since
both deaths stemmed directly from the actions of on-duty police officers. But these incidents were
hardly as egregious as the police-involved deaths of Eric Garner and Walter Scott, both of whom
Bor and colleagues referenced in the first sentence of their article.
Other times, officers use deadly force on individuals who are not in possession of a deadly
weapon, but who nevertheless pose an imminent threat to their safety or the safety of others. For
example, Kobvey Igbuhay, an 18-year-old Asian male, was unarmed when Officer Jimmy Houston
shot him. Yet, in the moments before he was fatally shot, Igbuhay attempted to drown both Officer
Houston and his K9 partner (Sampson, 2015). Given the complexity of these incidents, public
health and medical researchers should strongly consider involving policing scholars on projects that
examine police shootings. Such collaborations could yield insight into the nuances of data and how
they should be interpreted.
Deaths from police intervention are extremely rare – there are roughly 1,000 of them each year
in the context of tens of millions of police-civilian interactions (Hyland et al., 2015; Tregle et al.,
2019). It is far more common for officers to take armed/dangerous individuals into custody without
using deadly force (Wheeler et al., 2018; Worrall et al., 2018). It is absolutely necessary to study
the potential public health effects of police intervention. Yet, focusing on extremely rare incidents
and reducing them to an overly-simplistic dichotomy may diminish police legitimacy in the eyes
of the public, reduce police morale, and hinder our understanding of the structural conditions we
hope to improve.
