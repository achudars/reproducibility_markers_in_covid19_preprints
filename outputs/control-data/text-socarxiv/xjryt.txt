As we noted prominently, our initially uploaded preprint was a "non-peer-reviewed draft
subject to revision". We have now recognized and corrected an important error in our data
and code (details at https://github.com/pesavage/moralizing-gods) leading us to withdraw this
version of the manuscript. Correcting this error does not change any of the conclusions of our
original article1. A correction notice and an updated version of this manuscript2 have been
submitted for peer review and will be posted publicly once they have completed peer review.
Please do not cite, use or distribute the previous version further. We apologize for any
confusion caused.
