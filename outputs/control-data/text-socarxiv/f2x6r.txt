"5" "Abstract"
"6" "Subjective emptiness is a pervasive transdiagnostic construct. The aim of this series of studies was to use construct validation procedures to better understand the nature and correlates of subjective emptiness. A literature review led to 88 items which were then trimmed to 53 via qualitative interviews with patients and experts.  This preliminary scale was administered to 543 university students and 1,067 clinical participants along with measures of depression, meaning in life, borderline personality disorder, and impulsivity. The scale was reduced to 17 items following item analysis, factor and item response theory analyses, extreme groups comparisons, and examinations of criterion validity. This 17-item scale, along with measures of identity disturbance and maladaptive personality traits, was then administered to 1,016 clinical participants. The scale was trimmed to 7 items based on results from these data. Results strongly supported the unidimensionality of subjective emptiness and its transdiagnostic clinical value."

"8" "Subjective emptiness is a state of profound hollowness (Freeman, 2007; Kernberg, 1975; Levy, 1984; Singer, 1977a, 1977b) in which the individual feels bereft of fulfillment and connection to the external world (Bateman & Krawitz, 2013; Freeman, 2007; Kernberg, 1975; LaFarge, 1989). Emptiness is most typically conceived in assessment practice as a diagnostic criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Relative to other borderline features, emptiness is associated with greater impairment across the broadest range of psychosocial domains and is one of the slowest remitting symptoms (Ellison Rosenstein, Chelminski, Dalrymple, & Zimmerman, 2016; Zanarini et al., 2007). Although it is most commonly studied in the context of BPD, emptiness is a transdiagnostic construct shown to be associated with agoraphobia (Milrod, 2007), anxiety (Klonsky, 2008; Ribeiro, Ribeiro, Ribeiro, & von Doellinger, 2013; Silk, 2010; Mann, Laitman, & Davis, 1989; Trull & Widiger, 1991), depression (Klonsky, 2008), narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders (Gunderson & Ronningstam, 2001; Zerach, 2016), and dissociation (Rallis, Deming, Glenn, & Nock, 2012)."
"9" "Preliminary research suggests that higher levels of emptiness are related to diverse negative outcomes including impulsive and self-harming behavior (Blasco-Fontecilla et al., 2013, 2015; Ellison et al., 2016; Khantzian, Halliday, & McAuliffe, 1990; Klonsky, 2008; Lloyd, Raymond, Miner, & Coleman, 2007; Orbach, Mikulincer, Gilboa-Schechtman, & Sirota, 2003; Rallis et al., 2012), emotion dysregulation (Beck, Freeman et al., 1990; Brown, 1998; Hayes, Wilson, Gifford, Follette, & Strosahl, 1996; LaFarge, 1989; Linehan, 1993), social dysfunction (Ellison et al., 2016; Klonsky, 2008; Lamprell, 1994; Peteet, 2011; Richman & Sokolove, 1992), and problems with identity and self-concept (Kernberg, 1975; Kohut, 1977; Levy, 1984). Individuals who experience significant emptiness also report higher rates of psychiatric hospitalization, absenteeism at work, and reliance on disability benefits (Ellison et al., 2016). Although preliminary evidence suggests that electroconvulsive therapy (Sadeghi, Davoodi, & Hoseini, 2016) and group schema therapy (Farrell, Shaw, & Webber, 2009) may alleviate feelings of emptiness, thus far efficacious pharmacological ( Bellino, Bozzatello, Rinaldi, & Bogetto, 2011; Bellino, Bozzatello, Rocca, & Bogetto, 2014; Bellino, Paradiso, Bozzatello, & Bogetto, 2010;  Pascual et al., 2008) psychotherapeutic approaches (Scheel, 2000; Verheul et al., 2003) have not been identified for treating subjective emptiness."
"10" "Despite this initial evidence that subjective emptiness represents a transdiagnostic risk factor for a host of clinically important outcomes, sustained programs of research on the concept are missing from the literature.  The purpose of this project was to identify the core markers and correlates of subjective emptiness via the process of construct validation."
"11" "Existing Measures of Emptiness"
"12" "Given that it is a diagnostic criterion of BPD, a common approach to studying emptiness has been to use a single item from instruments designed to measure BPD (Blasco-Fontecilla et al., 2015; Ellison et al., 2016; Gunderson & Ronningstam, 2001; Klonsky, 2008; Stepp, Pilkonis, Yaggi, Morse, & Feske, 2009; Rallis, Deming, Glenn, & Nock, 2012). Although this work has helped establish the clinical relevance of emptiness, there are two significant limitations to this approach to conceptualizing emptiness. First, single items are generally less reliable than multi-item scales. Second, emptiness appears to be a transdiagnostic construct that merits investigation in its own right, independent of its functioning within the context of a BPD diagnosis."
"13" "A related approach has been to use multi-item emptiness scales that are embedded in measures of higher order constructs like BPD. For instance, Poreh et al. (2006) constructed the  Borderline Personality Questionnaire  using items based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BPD, including emptiness. The internal consistency of the emptiness subscale ranged from .73-.81 across three university student samples. However, the correlates of the scale were only assessed at the level of the overall BPD construct, and the contents of the emptiness scale included items involving loneliness, identity disturbance, meaning or purpose in life, and boredom. The  Mental Pain Questionnaire  (Orbach, Mikulincer, Sirota, & Gilboa-Schechtman, 2003) includes an emptiness subscale for which items were generated using transcripts from interviews with individuals in clinical and non-clinical samples. In initial validation work, the emptiness subscale showed acceptable internal consistency (α = .75) and was moderately correlated with both anxiety ( r  = .37) and depression ( r  = .43). However, the scale includes items assessing meaning or purpose in life, in addition to those measuring emptiness, suggesting that it is assessing a somewhat broader construct than what is intended by the clinical literature. Finally, items for the  Experienced Levels of Emptiness Scale  (Hazell, 1984) were generated using existing theories of emptiness and transcripts from interviews with non-clinical adults and refined using factor analysis. The scale exhibited acceptable internal consistency (α = .92) and a strong relationship with depression ( r  = .69) in a sample of 265 college students and 5 psychiatric patients. However, validation of this measure beyond these initial results has been limited, and the scale includes content related to alexithymia and depersonalization, again suggesting that it is somewhat broad and possibly multidimensional."
"14" "Each of these multi-item scales has potential utility. However, they were developed in the context of overarching models of other constructs, and they often included heterogeneous item content that may not reflect a core emptiness construct, but other associated albeit distinct dimensions. We sought to focus more exclusively on the core features of emptiness, by eschewing content related to empirically similar but conceptually distinguishable concepts."
"15" "Overview of Present Studies"
"16" "We approached this task by adopting the three steps of construct validation articulated in modern psychometric theory (Jackson, 1970; Loevinger, 1957; Simms & Watson, 2007; Tellegen & Waller, 2008). Construct validation theory asserts that the articulation of a theoretical construct and the development of a method with which to measure that construct are fundamentally intertwined endeavors: the process of creating a measure is how the scientist creates and tests a theory."
"17" "The first step in this process is to define the construct of interest, including relatively precise assertions regarding what psychological features and behaviors are and are not aspects of that construct. This is challenging because many psychological features tend to be correlated in nature and in psychological assessment. This step corresponds to the psychometric principle of content validity and establishes the boundaries of the construct of interest. As described in greater detail below, we used a variety of procedures to establish content validity, including literature review and item reviews by experts and patients."
"18" "The second step involves testing this definition in terms of its internal structure. To the degree that the initial definition is correct, the contents thought to reflect a single construct should be internally consistent and should reliably discriminate people at different levels of the latent trait. If multiple dimensions are proposed, those dimensions should be apparent in factor analytic models. Given our goal of identifying the core features of emptiness, we sought to identify a robust unidimensional model, as free as possible from the impact of correlated but independent factors."
"19" "The third step involves examining the associations of the resulting measure (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). To the degree that the definition is accurate, scores on the measure should correlate in an anticipated pattern, with more closely related constructs being more strongly associated than less related constructs (Campbell & Fiske, 1959; Westen & Rosenthal, 2003). We administered a variety of personality and psychopathology measures to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of our subjective emptiness items."
"20" "This research was approved by local IRB and all participants were consented. Methods and results are presented for each stage of the construct validation process sequentially. Thus, the following three sections describe methods and results for studies in several samples designed to define emptiness, determine its core features, and establish its correlates."
"21" "Study 1: Defining emptiness"
"22" "The fact that subjective emptiness is, by definition, an absence of something makes it difficult to define precisely (Brown, 1998). There is a risk of getting away from the core of the experience by defining emptiness in terms of closely related constructs such as loneliness and numbness (Hazell, 2003). We consulted the theoretical and empirical literature (Fogarty, 2000; Kernberg, 1975; Klonsky, 2008; LaFarge, 1989; Lamprell, 1994; Levy, 1984; Peteet, 2011; Singer, 1977) and conducted thematic analyses of online content and transcripts from interviews with clinical patients who experience emptiness (Fainsilber & Ortony, 1987; Ortony, 1975) in order to generate a set of features specifically characteristic of emptiness (Rier, 2007). We translated those features into questionnaire items, with the goal of writing unambiguous items that are easy to read, endorsable, and free from jargon and colloquialisms. This process yielded a preliminary 88-item scale."
"23" "We next asked experts to rate the content validity of these items. Thirteen subject matter experts (SMEs) and eighteen adults from a clinical sample who reported experiencing clinically significant emptiness (patient experts; PEs), completed content validity surveys adapted from Lawshe (1975). Experts rated each item according to its content relevance, with a focus on the degree to which it captured the core of emptiness as distinct from closely related concepts. Experts were invited to edit items, suggest new items, and provide qualitative feedback regarding ways to improve content validity. Calculation of Lawshe’s (1975) Content Validity Ratio (CVR), an index of agreement among judges, revealed that the expert and patient panels reliably rated 95.45% and 93.18% of the items as useful, respectively. Inclusion of construct irrelevant content was the most commonly cited reason for poor content validity among the SMEs."
"24" "These results were supplemented with thematic analyses of transcripts from telephone interviews with 18 patients who self-reported personal experience with clinically significant emptiness. Based on the expert ratings and qualitative analyses of these interviews, we refined our initial item set to be more specific, distinct, and evocative. We again required that the items be straightforward, free from jargon or colloquialism, and easy to read. This process resulted in 53 items we expected to reflect the core features of subjective emptiness that we then used in the second stage of the construct validation process. Items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 =  Not at all true  to 4 =  Very true ."
"25" "Study 2: Determining the core features of emptiness"
"26" "We used data from three samples in the next two stages of the project, in which we determined the core features of emptiness and trimmed our items to create a robust, unidimensional emptiness measure and then examined the correlates of that measure."
"27" "Method"
"28" "Participants."
"29" "Sample 1 consisted of undergraduate students from California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) who were recruited via the human participant pool website and compensated with course credit ( n  = 543). Samples 2 ( n  = 1,067) and 3 ( n  = 1,016) consisted of adults diagnosed with psychiatric disorders who were recruited using social media platforms (e.g. Reddit), classified websites (e.g. Craigslist), support groups (e.g. Meetup groups), and online research study listings websites (e.g. www.callforparticipants.com). Clinical participants in samples 2 and 3 did not receive compensation. Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and fluent in English. We only analyzed data for participants meeting inclusion criteria and completing at least 90% of the survey (98.7% of the student sample and 76.2% of the clinical sample)."
"30" "Sample 1 comprised 417 women, 126 men,  aged 18 to 46 years,  M  = 20.22,  SD  = 3.17, of whom 44.5% were Hispanic/Latino, 26.7% Caucasian, 14.3% Asian/Pacific Islander, 10.8% Other, and 3.1% African-American. Thirty-five (6.4%) reported taking psychiatric medication and 39 participants (7.2%) attended therapy."
"31" "Sample 2 comprised 716 women, 342 men,  aged 18 to 77 years ( M  = 29.78,  SD  = 11.49). The ethnic background of the sample was 81.8% Caucasian, 7.6% Other, 4.1% Hispanic/Latino, 3.2% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2.2% African-American. Among participants in sample 2, 42.3% completed some college, 25.1% possessed a bachelor’s degree, 15.3% earned a high school diploma/G.E.D., 13.2% earned a postgraduate degree, and 3.7% did not graduate from high school. Six-hundred and ninety-three (64.9%) reported taking psychiatric medication and 520 participants (48.7%) attended therapy."
"32" "Sample 3 comprised 572 women, 403 men, and 39 other,  aged 18 to 76 years ( M  = 27.50,  SD  = 10.13). The sample was 81.5% Caucasian, 6.9% Other, 5.0% Asian/Pacific Islander, 4.1% Hispanic/Latino, and 2.0% African-American of whom 41.4% had completed some college, 22.9% possessed a bachelor’s degree, 18.4% earned a high school diploma/G.E.D., 12.5% earned a postgraduate degree, and 4.3% did not graduate from high school. Five-hundred and three (49.5%) participants reported taking psychiatric medication and 397 participants (39.1%) attended therapy."
"33" "Analyses and Results"
"34" "As a first step, a single component was extracted via PCA in sample 1 using SPSS version 22.0. An examination of the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin measure of sampling adequacy suggested that sample 1 was factorable (KMO = .97) and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant ( X 2  (1,378) = 19,630.09,  p  < .001). All items in the 53-item model loaded at least moderately onto the first component (.48-.83), which accounted for 48.63% of the total covariance among the items. This result suggested that we had succeeded in identifying a core marker of subjective emptiness. Although eigenvalues suggested the potential interpretability of additional factors, our focus was on refining this single core dimension."
"35" "We sought to trim the scale by removing problematic items. Items were discarded due to extreme means or limited variances, failure to meet the 4 th  grade and lower reading level criteria, deviations from predicted patterns of criterion correlations, and relatively low item-total correlations or component loadings (see Table 5 in the Supplemental Material available online)."
"36" "The resulting 17-item scale was then subjected to PCA analysis in sample 1. Again, an examination of the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin measure of sampling adequacy suggested that the data were factorable (KMO = .96) and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant ( X 2  (136) = 5,826.63,  p  < .001). Loadings from this model ranged from .69 to .84 and the first component accounted for 55.53% of the total item covariance."
"37" "Confirmatory factor analysis with full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation in Mplus version 8 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2017) was used in sample 2 to cross-validate this model. Model fit was assessed using a variety of fit indices including the TLI, CFI, SRMR, and RMSEA, with cutoff values recommended by Hu and Bentler (1999; TLI and CFI > .95, SRMR < .08, and RMSEA < .06.) The 17-item model identified in sample 1 did not fit the data well (Table 1). Several items were discarded due to evidence of local dependence as indicated by standardized residual covariances over |2.58| (see Table 5 in the Supplemental Material available online). The resulting 10-item model (model 2) showed improved albeit sub-optimal fit. Hence, three more items exhibiting local dependence were removed. The resulting 7-item model fit the data well across criteria. We cross-validated this model in sample 3, where it continued to fit the data well (Table 1). The internal consistencies of the items in this model were .91 and .93 across samples 2 and 3, respectively, and standardized path coefficients ranged from .73 to .85 (sample 2) and .70 to 89 (sample 3)."
"38" "As a final step, we examined item properties using Item Response Theory in sample 3. A graded response model was estimated to account for polytomous items. Models were estimated using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation in MPlus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2017). Three parameters were of interest for each item. Discrimination parameters indicate how well different scores on that item distinguish between people higher vs. lower on the latent subjective emptiness continuum, termed theta. Threshold parameters indicate the level of theta at which this discrimination occurs. Finally, item information functions indicate how much information is provided by the item about different levels of theta. These parameters can be found in Table 1."
"39" "Following Baker’s (2001) conventions, all items discriminated highly among varying levels of emptiness ( a  > 2.00). Threshold parameters within different item response anchors were ordered correctly (meaning, for instance, that people who said “very true” had a higher score on theta than people who said “sometimes true ” . However, the probability of endorsing the third response option (“mainly true”) was low, particularly on items 5, 6, and 7, which led to some redundancy for the “mainly true” and “very true” responses. It is desirable for items to vary in difficulty such that the thresholds of all items will cover the entire range of theta. For items 1-5, threshold parameters were below the mean of theta, whereas item 6 was fairly centered on mean theta and item 7 had a threshold just above the mean. This distribution hints at the underlying skew of subjective emptiness, and thus it is appropriate that most of the items on the scale distinguish variants at the lower end of theta indicating that the SES precisely measured a somewhat narrow range of theta. Examination of the item information curves indicated that all items provide significant information, although the information provided by items 1, 3, and 6 was broader than that provided by 2, 4, 5, and 7 ( see Figure s   1 and 2 )."
"40" "Study 3: Evaluating the external validity of emptiness"
"41" "Having developed a robust, reliable, and unidimensional index of subjective emptiness, our third objective was to examine the convergent and discriminant correlates of the construct across all three samples. We expected patients to have substantially higher scores than students given our understanding of emptiness as a transdiagnostic clinical construct. In terms of correlates with other instruments, we anticipated that SES scores would exhibit strong positive correlations with scores on the emptiness item of a BPD measure as well as associations with other BPD symptoms and higher levels of various traits related to negative affect (e.g., negative affectivity, emotional lability, anxiousness, depression, restricted affectivity) and identity problems. We expected significant but somewhat weaker correlates with less related constructs, such as impulsive behavior and psychotic thinking."
"42" "Samples 1 and 2 measures"
"43" "The  Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD)  is a 9-item measure of DSM-IV BPD features ( Zanarini, Weingeroff, Frankenburg, & Fitzmaurice, 2015 ). Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale with higher ratings indicating higher levels of psychopathology. For example, the item measuring identity disturbance is rated from 0 =  I have had a good idea of who I am  to 4 =  I have felt that I had no idea of who I am most of the time . Internal consistency was .82 for sample 1 and .83 for sample 2."
"44" "The  Purpose in Life test short form (PIL-SF)  is a 4-item scale designed to assess the presence of meaning and purpose in life ( Schulenberg, Schnetzer, & Buchanan, 2011 ). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., 1 =  I have no goals or aims ; 5 =  I have clear goals and aims ). Internal consistency was .83 for sample 1 and .85 for sample 2."
"45" "The  Barratt Impulsiveness Scale–Brief (BIS-Brief)  is an 8-item scale measuring trait impulsivity (Steinberg, Sharp, Stanford, & Tharp, 2013). Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 =  Rarely/Never  to 4 =  Almost always/Always . Internal consistency was .72 for sample 1 and .84 for sample 2."
"46" "The  Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES‐D 10)  is a 10-item scale measuring depression (Andersen, Malmgren, Carter, & Patrick, 1994). Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 =  Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)  to 4 =  All of the time (5‐7 days) . Internal consistency was .81 for sample 1 and .83 for sample 2."
"47" "Sample 3 measures"
"48" "The  Self-concept and Identity Measure (SCIM)  is a 27-item scale measuring clinically relevant identity disturbance (Kaufman, Cundiff, & Crowell, 2015). Items include “I have never really known what I believe or value,” and are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 =  Strongly Disagree  to 7 =  Strongly Agree . The SCIM is correlated with emotion dysregulation, Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and other measures of psychopathology. Scores on the SCIM have been found to yield high internal consistency (α = .89), test–retest reliability (α = .93,  r  = .88; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88), and adequate construct validity. Internal consistency of the SCIM instrument (α = .92) and its subscales, identity disturbance (α = .88), identity consolidation (α = .83), and lack of identity (α = 0.89), were acceptable in the present study for sample 3."
"49" "The  Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Short Form (PID-5-SF)  is a 100-item scale measuring pathological personality traits (Maples et al., 2015). Items include “I’m good at conning people,” and are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 =  Very False or Often False  to 4 =  Very True or Often True ."
"50" "Results"
"51" "One-way multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) revealed significant large effects (Cohen, 1969) of sample such that student participants scored significantly lower across all seven items than clinical participants in samples two,  F  (7, 1,575) = 117.20,  p  < .001; Wilk's Λ = 0.658, partial η2 = .34, and three,  F  (7, 1,533) = 126.38,  p  < .001; Wilk's Λ = 0.634, partial η2 = .37."
"52" "Validity correlations are displayed in Tables 3 and 4. Scores on the SES were strongly correlated with higher scores on the emptiness symptom of BPD and the overall BPD composite, as expected. Also, as hypothesized, moderately strong positive correlations were found between emptiness and indicators of negative affectivity and identity problems but lower correlations with indicators of impulsivity and psychoticism. More specifically, emptiness was positively associated with lower meaning in life, heightened detachment, separation insecurity, intimacy avoidance, anhedonia, and withdrawal. With respect to identity problems, identity consolidation was moderately lower and identity disturbance moderately higher among those with higher emptiness scores, whereas, the positive relationship between emptiness and lack of identity was particularly strong."
"53" "In terms of discriminant validity, correlations between emptiness and hostility, submissiveness, impulsivity, antagonism, disinhibition, attention seeking, callousness, deceitfulness, grandiosity, manipulativeness, distractibility, irresponsibility, rigid perfectionism, and unusual beliefs and experiences, a subscale of psychoticism, were small. We were somewhat surprised by positive moderate relationships between emptiness scores and perseveration, suspiciousness, psychoticism, eccentricity, and perceptual dysregulation. These results may have to do with our validating measure, as previous research has found that the Psychoticism scales of the PID-5 have a very general pattern of correlations, whereas the risk-taking scale does not correlate strongly with indicators such as BPD (Hopwood, Thomas, Markon, Wright, & Krueger, 2012)."
"54" "Discussion"
"55" "Subjective emptiness is a serious clinical transdiagnostic symptom associated with a variety of mental health problems, significant psychosocial impairment, and high-risk complications (Blasco-Fontecilla et al., 2013; Ellison et al., 2016; Gunderson & Ronningstam, 2001; Klonsky, 2008; Stoffers et al., 2010; Zanarini et al., 2007). Despite its clinical significance, focused research on the identification, causes, and treatment of emptiness has been limited. We reasoned that one barrier to such research is the current lack of measurement tools specifically designed to assess subjective emptiness. Most research on emptiness has occurred in the context of BPD, for which emptiness is a DSM symptom. However, the symptom seems to be empirically related to a number of constructs beyond BPD. Existing standalone measures tend to include content of only tertiary importance to emptiness or to exclude core aspects of the construct in relation to clinical theory. As a result, the field’s understanding of the content and correlates of subjective emptiness remains limited."
"56" "The Nature of Subjective Emptiness"
"57" "As such, our goal was to better understand the nature of subjective emptiness via a process of construct validation. We first conducted an extensive literature review, leading to the generation of items that capture the construct as it has been described by clinical theorists and researchers. We next conducted extensive content validity analyses designed to identify the most salient, core features of the construct, and to develop candidate items for a measurement tool that could be used to assess emptiness. We then collected data from clinical and non-clinical samples in order to identify a robust unidimensional scale and to examine the correlates of subjective emptiness.  Ultimately, this research provided new information about the clinical importance of a relatively common, transdiagnostic construct and resulted in the 7-item self-report Subjective Emptiness Scale (SES), a useful measure for further research on the topic."
"58" "These studies revealed the core features and conceptual boundaries of subjective emptiness as reported by individuals who have experienced the condition. Covariance analyses pointed to a unidimensional construct whose core features include a pervasive and visceral sense of detachment spanning intrapersonal, interpersonal, and existential domains of experience as evidenced by a factor structure encompassing feelings of hollowness, absence from one’s own life, profound aloneness, disconnection from the world, and chronic unfulfillment. Item Response Theory further showed that the items varied in difficulty suggesting that these core features may reflect a relatively broad range of the emptiness construct."
"59" "Not surprisingly, patients reported substantially higher rates of subjective emptiness than non-clinical participants. The correlates of emptiness imply a profoundly negative affective state associated with heightened hostility, anxiousness, and depression. Specific correlates also offer two more insights regarding the nature of emptiness and its place within more general models of psychopathology, as enumerated below."
"60" "First, psychoanalytically oriented clinical theorists have posited that emptiness may be a result of a conflicted identity (Kernberg, 1975; Kohut, 1977). The general idea is that the individual experiences an inner emptiness that leads to a dependence on others to experience wholeness and satisfaction. At the same time, the maladaptive sense of self can turn others away through hostility or self-loathing behavior. Thus, the individual will tend to vacillate through different self-states and ultimately experience emptiness as the end result of a vicious cycle. In contrast to this hypothesis, in the current study subjective emptiness was more strongly associated with a lack of identity than identity disturbance. This suggests that emptiness may involve an impoverished identity more than dependence on others to feel complete or instability in certain components of identity (e.g. values and opinions), as suggested by some clinical theorists."
"61" "Second, hierarchical models of psychopathology dimensions and maladaptive traits have enjoyed increasing influence as a potential replacement to the categorical model of polythetic syndromes that have dominated psychiatric diagnosis for several decades (Clark, Cuthbert, Lewis-Fernández, Narrow, & Reed, 2017; Kotov et al., 2017; Krueger et al., 2018). At a relatively broad level, these models describe an internalizing domain that includes experiences of negative affect and interpersonal detachment. Our results suggest that emptiness was strongly correlated to constructs from this domain, and more strongly so than more “externalizing” constructs such as hostility and impulsivity. However, there is less consensus regarding the lower levels of prominent hierarchical models of psychopathology dimensions than the broader levels, and these models do not tend to include an independent emptiness construct. The clinical importance and relatively unique content evidenced in these studies suggest that emptiness may comprise an overlooked yet clinically significant facet of psychopathology that is currently missing in such taxonomies."
"62" "Limitations and Future Directions"
"63" "This study had several strengths, including extensive item derivation and content validity analyses, sampling of several large and clinically diverse samples, and extensive validity analyses including multiple approaches to the examination of construct structure and a wide array of validating measures. Nevertheless, several limitations may affect the interpretability and generalizability of these findings and point to important directions for further research. First, common method bias may have inflated parameter estimates since all constructs were measured using self-report questionnaires. Although self-report is the most intuitive approach to measuring subjective inner states, it would be informative to examine associations between subjective emptiness and outcomes assessed via different methods. Similarly, examinations of the links between subjective emptiness and clinically important but low base rate phenomena such as self-harming behavior would be particularly informative. The relatively high dropout rate among clinical samples may have biased results, to the degree that study variables may have been related to dropout. Fortunately, the use of FIML limited the impact of missing data on model results. There was also a relative lack of ethnic diversity among the samples. Future studies should examine whether findings from this study generalize to other kinds of samples. Finally, longitudinal research would be informative regarding the stability of subjective emptiness at different timescales, and treatment studies would be useful for examining its sensitivity to various kinds of intervention."
"64" "Conclusion"
"65" "In conclusion, results from this series of studies identified the core features and correlates of subjective emptiness, a clinically important construct that has been discussed extensively in the theoretical literature, but which has been the subject of only limited empirical research. Findings suggest that subjective emptiness is characterized by hollowness, disconnection, and unfulfillment, and is strongly associated with a variety of internalizing features involving negative affect, interpersonal detachment, and identity problems. This research also contributed to the development of a brief, unidimensional measure, the Subjective Emptiness Scale (SES), that should be useful for future research on subjective emptiness."
