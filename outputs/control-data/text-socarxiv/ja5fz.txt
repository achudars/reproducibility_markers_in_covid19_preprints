Abstract
The study aims at suggesting effective methods and techniques that could improve English as a
foreign language EFL students’ performance in writing skills. The researcher uses the descriptive,
analytical method. Four tools were adopted pretest, post-test, supporting program, and a
questionnaire for teachers for collecting data. Twenty-five students in Holy Quran University,
Sudan, were chosen purposively, and thirty EFL teachers at a university level were randomly
selected as a sample for the study. Ninty percent of the teachers agree on the suggested program
and techniques. The findings of the study indicate that: using varied techniques and activities in
pre-writing stage promotes students’ performances in writing, integration of reading and writing
skills in the classroom improves students’ writing skills, as well as encouraging extensive reading
outside the classroom promotes students’ performance in writing skills. Accordingly, the
researcher recommends that: teachers should focus on the prewriting stage through different
activities as well as reading and writing should be used in an integrated way in-class writing to
guide the writing process.

Introduction
Writing skill is essential because it is a thinking tool and helps in the development of a language.
Bjork & Raisanen 1997 as cited in Javid & Umer, 2014 state:
We highlight the importance of writing in all university curricula not only because of its
immediate practical application, i.e., as an isolated skill or ability but because we believe
that, from a broader perspective, writing is a thinking tool. It is a tool for language
development, for critical thinking and, extension, for learning in all disciplines. (p.164)
To write it is essential to understand the primary system of a language. In English, this includes
knowledge of grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. Vocabulary is also necessary, as is
correct spelling and formatting. It is retrieved from
https://www.englishclub.com/writing/what.htm
Mohammad & Hazarika, (2016) state that “
There is no doubt in the fact that writing is a tool for the creation of ideas and the
consolidation of the linguistic system by using it for communicative objectives in an
interactive way. Thus, it implies the successful transmission of ideas from an addresser to
an addressee through a text, and this exchange of information becomes a powerful means
to motivate and encourage the development of writing skills. Writing is often a challenge
for EFL learners as it is the most painstaking and challenging language skill. (P.1)
Nunan (2003) notes that
writing is both a physical and a mental act. At the most basic level, writing is the physical
act of committing words or ideas to some medium. On the other hand, writing is the mental
work of inventing ideas, thinking about how to express them, and organizing them into
statements and paragraphs that will be clear to a reader. (P.22)
This study aims to suggest some techniques and activities to be used in teaching writing skills to
the students belonging to English department in the College of Education at Holy Quran University
to improve their writing skills.
Statement of the problem
As an EFL teacher for ten years or more, the researcher has observed that most of the EFL students
in Holy Quran university do not benefit from writing courses. Teaching writing at the university
level has little effect on students’ writing performance. It seems that the students are not exposed
to sufficient and suitable writing materials, which are not enough to enable them to make use of
the prescribed instructions.
Significance of the Study
This study suggests effective techniques and activities for improving students’ performance in
writing. There are various techniques and activities which are very important for improving the
students’ performance in writing skills. Applying these techniques in teaching writing will enable
the students to write effectively and efficiently to achieve his/her purpose. EFL teachers’ trainers

who teach methodology can benefit from the study by applying the techniques and activities
suggested by the researcher.
Objectives of the study
This study aims to:
1. suggest appropriate techniques and activities in pre writing stage to create interest and
promote students’ performance writing skills.
2. Implement writing techniques and strategies such as organization, outlining,
formatting, revising, and editing to improve the students’ performance in writing.
3. Integrating reading and writing by suggesting reading materials that improve students'
proficiency in both reading and writing through adopting blended method.
4. Emphasize the necessity of extensive reading outside the class.
Questions of the study
1- How can students’ performance in writing skills be promoted?
2- To what extent does the integration of reading skills and writing skills enhance students’
performance in writing?
3- How can extensive reading outside classroom promote students’ writing performance?
Hypotheses of the study
1- Using varied techniques and activities in the pre-writing stage like reading about the topic,
watching a film, listening to a situation, or even describing a picture of the topic promote
students’ performances in writing`.
2- Integration of reading and writing skills improves students’ writing skills by reducing
spelling, punctuation, quotation, and capitalization mistakes.
3- Reading outside classrooms (extensive reading) promotes students’ performance in
writing skills.
Methodology of the Study
The descriptive analytical method was adopted. four tools of data collection will be carried, a
questionnaire, pretest, supporting programme and post-test. A questionnaire was distributed
among thirty EFL university teachers. The pretest was given to twenty-five students from Holly
Quran University to assess their performance in writing skills. The supporting programme was
proposed to enhance students’ performance according to the pretest results. The post-test was
given to the same group of students to see to what extent the students benefit from the supporting
programme.
Literature Review
Definition of academic writing
According to Al Fadda, (2012) academic writing is a mental and cognitive activity, since it is a
product of the mind. The image of an individual working alone in a quiet environment has
furthered the view of writing as a mental and cognitive activity. However, as it has been pointed
out, “writing can be understood only from the perspective of a society rather than a single
individual” (Burke, 2010, p. 40-41). Al Fadda, (2012) also adds that: “one of the basics of
academic writing is the ability of the learners to access the relevant references and evaluate them

in order to put the different ideas and opinions together so that they can develop their own
voice”.(P.2)
Academic writing includes making an outline, summarizing and paraphrasing which
students might struggle when writing their tasks. Al-Khasawneh & Maher (2010).
Concepts about academic writing
Writing could be a difficult skill to be learned or taught due to the fact that it is not a simple
cognitive activity; rather it is believed to be a complex mental production which requires "careful
thought, discipline and concentration" (Grami, 2010, p. 9). Al Fadda (2012) finds out that the main
challenges English a second language (ESL) students encounter are differentiating between written
and spoken words and phrases, reviewing grammar including subject-verb agreement and joining
sentences together to make a coherent paragraph. (P.1)
Richards & Renandya, (2002) claim that “Writing involves very complex skills. Learners
of the second language (L2) writing have to attend to higher skills such as planning and organizing
and lower skills such as spelling and punctuation”. (P.304)
Difficulties of academic writing
Many factors may cause the difficulties of academic writing when the students try to create their
own piece of writing. Writing is a complex process because it requires the mastery of
grammatical devices, conceptual thinking and judgmental (have a purpose and activating)
elements (Byrne 1988, P.4).
In the process of learning EFL, students face many difficulties in writing, especially in
capitalization, punctuation, language use, tenses, preposition, spelling, word order, subject verb
agreement etc. The same issues have been raised by Khan (2011) as he mentions that they face
several problems in phoneme clusters, spellings, grammar, mistakes due to first language L1
interference, structure, doubling of subjects, doubling of preposition, tenses, articles, appropriate
vocabulary, incorrect use of prefixes & suffixes etc.
There is a study conducted by Ridha (2012) as cited in Taj Mohammad, & Zoheb, Hazarika
(2016.P.2) on Iraqi college students where she investigated errors in English essay writings of EFL
students. The errors were categorized according to the following taxonomy: grammatical, lexical,
semantic, mechanics, and word order types of errors. The grammatical and the mechanical errors
were the most serious and frequent ones. Most of the students’ errors were led by the Arabic
interference
Methodology

The sample of the study was composed of students of level Seven (Semester No 7) in the
college of education, Holly Quran University the total number of the student was (25). A number
of (30) EFL teachers were selected randomly from two universities (University of Gazira, and
Holy Quran University) to respond to the questionnaire.
A pre-test in writing skills was designed to check the students’ proficiency in writing in
which the students were asked to write about one subject.
Supporting Programme
The researchers proposed a supporting programme with the purpose of enhancing students’
performance in writing skills, to be taught in eight weeks for the students, two periods per a-week.
The researcher selected graded and interesting texts that suited students’ level of understanding
which contains different subjects to be taught as models of writing, with the use of a variety of
effective techniques and activities while teaching writing starting by:
pre-writing stage: In this pre-writing stage, the researcher used some techniques and activities
to help students to generate ideas through brainstorming sessions like reading about the topic,
watching a film, listening to a text related to the topic, and describing a picture about the topic.
Then the researcher sets a time limit for the students to be trained on how to brainstorm about a
topic by giving the students different topics and different activities and exercises, because the
researcher thinks that thinking and planning before writing will enable students to produce much
better writing.
Other formal writing stages: the researcher here wants to help the students understand how to
organize the material according to the requirements of the writing task and the general structure of
the English composition by asking the students to write their ideas about the topic. This could be
achieved by a writing technique called Listing. In this step, the student will write the topic at the
top of a piece of paper and then quickly make a list of words and phrases that come into his mind.
The next step is to organize the ideas into a simple outline. Next, the researcher asks the students
to write a rough draft, using their outline as a guide. The students will write their rough draft as
quickly as they can without stopping to think about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. just the aim
of this stage is to get their ideas on a paper. This rough draft will be full of mistakes and errors,
and this is perfectly usual and acceptable, because it is only a rough draft. They will fix the errors
later. The next step, is for revising and editing. First, the students should revise the issues of the
content and organization. Second, they should work on the smaller issues of grammar, punctuation,
and mechanics. At the end students will write their final copy of their topic.
The researcher provided more topics, exercises, and activities to deepen students’
understanding of the suggested techniques and steps of writing. Besides, the researcher gave them
eight articles about different topics to be read outside the classroom, hoping that this would help
them to read extensively to increase their linguistic competency and general knowledge. Weekly
the students were asked to summarize what they have read outside the classroom, and the
researcher provides them with the feedback. This mixture of in-class writing and outside reading
gives the students the practice they need to improve their writing skills.

This programme lasted in eight weeks, then it was followed by a post-test to see how much
students benefit from the supporting programme. The results of the post-test confirm the students’
improvement. It was a repeated test designed to assess students’ improvement by means of the
supporting program.
The Post-test
It was a writing test including one subject. It was designed to evaluate students’
improvement after the pre-test. From the pre-test given before the supporting program the
researcher could distinguish the areas of weaknesses and difficulties students face when they write
such as inadequate formatting, poor vocabulary knowledge, spelling mistakes, and misuse of
punctuation marks. The researcher developed a supporting programme to tackle the areas of
weaknesses. So, the post-test was expected to come out with better results.
The Questionnaire
The questionnaire contains twelve statements is meant to gather the relevant required data
from the teachers of English language at the universities of (Holy Quran University, and Gezira
university). It contains three various axes as follows:
The first axis, deals with the adequacy of the effective techniques and activities in prewriting
stage that can motivate the students. The second axis deals with the integration of reading and
writing skills inside the classroom while teaching writing steps. The third axis is concerned with
how practicing reading (Extensive Reading) outside the classroom develops the students’ writing
performance. This questionnaire has been arbitrated by experienced teachers of the English
language at different universities.
The questionnaire and the tests were arbitrated by experienced teachers from different
universities. They confirm both the tests and the questionnaire measure precisely what should be
measured.
Data Analysis and Discussion
This section is confined to the presentation, analysis, discussion and interpretation of the data
which were collected by means of the study tools: pre-test, post-test for students and the
questionnaire for EFL teachers. This section is divided into two parts: the first part includes the
tests results and the second part includes the questionnaire results.
The pre-test consists of the students writing work. First they were asked to write an essay
in not less than 500 words about “Living in Cities or Villages”. Time to finish this task was 90
minutes. Total papers were 25 essays. They were marked by five experienced teachers in the
department. Any one of them has been given five papers. They identified mistakes and provided
comments on the overall work. Their comments are summarized as follows:
-

The format is untidy.
Incorrect use of mechanics of writing (spelling, punctuation, quotation, and
capitalization).
Very weak structure.

-

Lacking the ability and capability to generate new ideas and thoughts.
Lacking the ability of how to develop a paragraph using topic sentence and supporting
sentences (Paragraph Development).
Some samples of the students’ work: (see appendix-A)
After the supporting program finished, the researcher asked the students to write an essay
about “Advantages and disadvantages of Co-Education in Sudan” (not less than 500words). The
same previous time for the pretest 90 minutes has been given for students to finish the posttest.
Total papers were 21 essays, because four of the students didn’t complete the program. The papers
were marked by the same teachers who marked the pretest papers. They identified few mistakes
this time and provided comments on the overall work. Their comments are summarized as follows:
-

-

The students used a good format.
Mistakes are not much in using of mechanics of writing (spelling, punctuation,
quotation, and capitalization) as in the pretest.
Most of the students’ work is organized and structured.
Most of the students have the ability and capability to generate new ideas and thoughts
based on the main topic. (most of the students’ works contain several specific and
factual supporting sentences that explain or prove the topic sentences, including at least
one example)
Most of the students have the ability to develop a paragraph using topic sentence and
supporting sentences (Paragraph Development).
