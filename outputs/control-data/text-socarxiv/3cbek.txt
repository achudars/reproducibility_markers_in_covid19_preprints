Abstract
Since English has become the business language of the world and of the Internet in recent years,
most education systems have emphasized its importance. However, in Saudi Arabia, students have
difficulties learning English, especially those taught with traditional teacher-centered methods. In
contrast, in the constructivist and cooperative learning methods, textbooks and teachers are no
longer the only sources of information; their primary task is facilitating interaction among students
and connecting students’ prior knowledge with new information. The present study investigates the
effects of using the 5Es teaching model on EFL female students’ motivation and achievement at
Taif University. Likewise, it may contribute to the literature on the 5Es model with EFL students’
motivation and achievement. The sample included 119 female Saudi undergraduate students
studying English as a foreign language (EFL) at the first level at Taif University, in Saudi Arabia.
They study English language with a focus on reading, writing, listening and speaking, for 6 hours
weekly over one academic semester. The sample was divided into a control group (n = 61) and an
experimental group (n = 58). Two research questions were addressed to examine whether: (1) there
are significant differences between the experimental group scores and the control group scores on
post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement and (2) there are
significant differences between the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’
motivation and their achievement for the experimental group. The researcher designed a program
incorporating the 5Es model of teaching and learning which was used with the experimental group
for ten weeks in 20 sessions. The 5Es model program provides the basis for learners to construct an
accurate understanding of a new concept based on existing knowledge. In contrast, the researcher

used traditional instruction with the control group for the same period. Besides the 5Es program, the
two groups were asked to answer questions on a 5-point Likert-scale motivation questionnaire
before and after the instruction to compare changes on students’ motivation. The following
statistics calculations were performed: t-test, mean, SD, and Pearson coefficient correlations to
analyze the data. The results showed that there are significant differences between the mean scores
of the experimental and control groups on the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’
motivation and their achievement in favor of the experimental group. Moreover, statistically
significant differences were found in the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’
motivation and their achievement for the experimental group, in favor of post-test.

Abstract
Since English has become the business language of the world and of the Internet in
recent years, most education systems have emphasized its importance. However, in Saudi
Arabia, students have difficulties learning English, especially those taught with traditional
teacher-centered methods. In contrast, in the constructivist and cooperative learning methods,

The present study investigates the effects of using the 5Es teaching model on EFL

CHAPTER ONE - INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
English has become the international to learn in recent years. In Saudi Arabia, students face
obstacles in learning English, especially those taught with traditional teacher-centered methods,
in which students repeat the same mistakes because teachers focus on certain language skills to
the detriment of others. In the past, teachers spent a lot of time focusing on the quality of the
language (such as spelling and grammar) rather than focusing on writing, speaking, and the use of
the language in everyday life. In contrast, in the constructivist and cooperative learning methods,
textbooks and teachers are no longer the only sources of information; they facilitate interaction
among students and connecting students’ prior knowledge with new information. This study
investigates the effects of using the 5Es teaching model on the EFL female students’ motivation
and achievement at Taif University. The researcher taught the program, prepared the achievement
test and prepared a motivation questionnaire to collect data.
Nowadays, a method of teaching where students receive all information from the teacher
is considered inadequate. Instead, it is necessary to replace the teacher-centered method with one
where students play the key role in the learning process. The constructivist and cooperative
learning methods are two important methods which deal with the learner as the basis of the learning
process. The most important benefit of the constructivist approach is that it allows the learner to
construct, explain, form, and improve his knowledge (İşcan, 2014), in contrast to the traditional
one (Kim, 2005). For instance, through the constructivist approach, learners connect their own
prior knowledge to new information, without a transfer of information from the teacher to the
learners. In addition, it puts the learners at the core of the learning process. The constructivist
method has been characterized as a learning-teaching process not the opposite (Kim, 2005). An

1

innovative teacher of English as a foreign language (EFL) must explore new methods to achieve
the central goal of language acquisition. In view of the difficulties faced by EFL students in Saudi
Arabia, the researcher pursues new ways to teach English effectively to Saudi students. One
method that depends on both the constructivist and cooperative learning approaches and can be
used to teach any language is the 5Es model of learning, which has long been used in teaching
sciences and languages outside Saudi Arabia.
1.2 Statement of the Problem
Today, the English programs in Saudi universities have been criticized by educators since
they depend on transferring information from the teacher to the learners without any opportunity
to connect prior knowledge to new knowledge. Moreover, the most common method used in Saudi
universities may affect the learners’ motivation towards learning English. Most Saudi learners
think that English is a difficult language to acquire because they only obtain the language
information directly from the teacher without any practice. Also, students’ achievement is affected
by the method of instruction. The aim of this study is to modify the method of instruction to
facilitate connecting both knowledge by using the 5Es model, which was previously used to teach
sciences. For example, Ceylan (2008) discusses the effectiveness of using the 5Es model to teach
chemistry to tenth-grade students. He collected data on their understanding and their attitudes
towards chemistry as a subject. Findings show that teaching the subject with the 5Es model resulted
in a better understanding concepts than using the traditional method of teaching. In addition,
students’ attitudes towards chemistry as a subject were positive.
In contrast, only a few studies have documented the 5Es model of learning in the English
classroom. Köksal (2009), for instance, researches the effectiveness of the 5Es model based on
the constructivist approach to teach simple past tense in English grammar to seventh-grade

2

students. He found that the 5Es model had a positive effect on students’ achievement and their
overall attitudes towards English.
The present study is an introduction into how this model affects learners’ achievement in
the EFL classroom. This is the first time this model has been used for teaching English in Taif
University.
Previous studies have shown that the 5Es model has a positive effect on achievement, and
that many students were not aware of the 5Es strategies while many teachers are either unfamiliar
with this learning technique or uncertain if these strategies are suitable for a particular learning
task (Kim, 2005). Thus, the present study may contribute to extant literature on the effectiveness
of the 5Es model on Saudi EFL students’ achievement.
1.3 Purpose and Rationale for the Study
This study investigates the effects of applying the 5Es model to increase the motivation
and achievement of Saudi EFL students who are in the first level of a four-level English language
program which is an obligatory part of the Bachelor’s Degree at Taif University. Indeed, the dearth
of extant research into the use of the 5Es in teaching and learning English, especially in the Saudi
context, was a motivating factor to undertake this study. For the most part, in Saudi Arabia, English
is taught with traditional methods that imply a transfer of information from the teacher to the
students who are passive recipients. In this light, the current study has the following ultimate
objectives:
1.

To determine the difference in students’ EFL achievement between a control group

taught using traditional method and an experimental group taught using the 5Es model.
2. To determine the difference in motivation to learn English between a control group
taught using traditional methods and an experimental group taught using the 5Es model.
3

1.4 Significance of the Study
The importance of this study arises from the recent interest on the role played by 5Es
strategies in learning (Johnson & Johnson, 1990; Kim, 2005; Carr, Sexton, & Lagunoff, 2006;
Bybee, 2009). The 5Es strategies encourage students to assume more responsibility for their
learning, whereas traditional methods tend to emphasize vocabulary and correct pronunciation.
With the 5Es, students need to look beyond the surface structure of texts to achieve a better
understanding of the intended message. Thus, this study may contribute to literature on the 5Es
model with EFL students’ achievement and motivation. Likewise, this study has the potential to
contribute to the field and practice of applied linguistics in the following ways:
1. It may help EFL teachers to value the 5Es model in teaching English, and to incorporate
it into their instruction with a view to improving students’ performance.
2. It may help students to become aware of constructive and cooperative learning that will
enhance their language acquisition.
1.5 Research Questions
This study bridges the gap between previous studies of teaching and using the 5Es model
to teach other subjects at the university level and the applicability of the model to the EFL
classroom. The present study focuses on the contribution of the 5Es model to achievement where
it pertains to the four language skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking achievement.
Accordingly, in this study, the following research questions are addressed:
1. Are there any statistically significant differences between the scores of the experimental
group and those of the control group scores on post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’
motivation and achievement?

4

2.

Are there any significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-

tests of the experimental group?
1.6 Research Hypotheses
In consideration of the research questions mentioned above, the researcher proposed
two hypotheses as follow:
1. There are significant differences between the scores of the experimental and the control
groups on the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and achievement. The
corresponding null hypothesis (H0) is that there are no differences or that they are not statistically
significant.
2. There are significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of
the experimental group on motivation and achievement. The corresponding null hypothesis (H0)
is that there are no differences or that they are not statistically significant.
1.7 Definition of Terms
The 5E Model: The “Five Es” is an instructional model developed by Roger Bybee in 1997.
The 5Es model provides the basis for learners to construct an accurate understanding of a new
concept based on existing knowledge. Each 'E' in the model represents a specific phase:
engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation.
Constructivism: It refers to the concept that students construct their knowledge individually
and collectively to solve problems provided by their environment (Davis, Maher, & Noddings,
1990). Students learn actively by engaging in authentic tasks, not by transferring and receiving
knowledge.

5

Motivation: L2 motivation is "the extent to which an individual works or strives to learn
the language because of a desire to do so and the satisfaction experienced in this activity” (Gardner,
1985, p. 63).
EFL female students: The participants in this study who were randomly chosen from the
first year non–English major students at Taif University. They were studying English as a Foreign
Language as one obligatory course in which they study language skills such as reading, writing,
listening and speaking for 6 hours weekly.
Control group: the group which is consisted of 61 students aged 18-23. The students in this
group were chosen randomly to be taught by the traditional method of teaching.
Experimental group: the group which is consisted of 58 students aged 18-20. The students
in this group were chosen randomly to be taught by using the 5Es model program.
1.8 Limitations of the Study
The current study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration when
interpreting the results. Firstly, all of the participants of the study are Saudi EFL learners enrolled
in an obligatory six-hour a week program at Taif University. Thus, the generalization of the results
may be limited in a different context with different generations, majors, and cultural backgrounds.
Secondly, the indication of the effect of the 5Es model use is limited to students’ results on their
curriculum tests in listening, speaking, writing, and reading. Therefore, a general language
proficiency test could be used to explore the impact of the 5Es model use on language proficiency.
Finally, the study adopted Gardner’s Attitude / Motivation Test Battery (AMI) questionnaire
(Gardner, 1960) to investigate students’ motivation toward learning English. Thus, the data were
collected through a self-questionnaire that may not reflect students’ actual attitude toward English.

6

Future research in this field may benefit from other data collection procedures, such as verbal
protocols along with this type of questionnaires.
1.9 Overview of Thesis Structure
The current study consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the nature and the
rationale of the study. Chapter 2 presents a literature review which is arranged under five headings:
introduction, the constructive approach of teaching and learning, the cooperative learning theory,
the learners’ motivation towards learning a foreign language, and the 5Es model. Chapter 3
describes the research design, methodology, and procedure. Chapter 4 presents the results of the
study. Chapter 5 discusses results obtained from the data, concludes the study, and offers
suggestions and recommendations for future researches.

CHAPTER TWO – LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
The following literature review focuses on the 5Es model, which derives from the
constructivist teaching method and cooperative learning, as well as on its effects on students’
achievement and motivation towards learning English.
2.2 The Constructivist Approach to Teaching and Learning
The constructivist method of teaching and learning has been the subject of many studies,
but it is mostly known for its emphasis on the student exploring environment while connecting
prior knowledge with new knowledge. Nevertheless, there are various definitions of
constructivism. Some believe that it is a theory whereby students construct their knowledge
individually and collectively to solve problems provided by their environment (Davis, Maher, &
Noddings, 1990). The external environment -other students and the teacher- provides the setting,
the challenges, and the support which may encourage the process of construction. Alternately,
Fosnot (1989) regards constructivism as a model that emphasizes the students’ involvement in the
learning process, whereby students reflect on their learning, construct deductions, and experience
cognitive conflicts.
According to Fosnot (1996), the constructive model of learning is as a self-management
process of connecting the existing personal experiences with discrepant new perceptions to
construct new representations of reality with culturally developed tools and symbols through
cooperative social activity, discourse, and debate. Whatever the definition, all perspectives share
the same frameworks, concepts, and features.
Clements (1997) and Galvin (2002) identified five components to the learning process in
the constructive theory: (a) encountering new knowledge, (b) identifying the relationship between

8

the new information and existing knowledge, (c) experiencing discussions about the new
information, (d) applying the new information to produce knowledge, and (e) reflecting on the
implications of the new information.
In the first phase, students experience some form of new knowledge, which Clements
defined as “beyond discovery” (Clements, 1997, p. 2). Various sources, such as lecture, research,
manipulation, experimentation, and invention can impart this new knowledge. In the second
phase, students determine the relationship between the new information that they want to acquire
and the knowledge they already possess. This is a personal process and depends also on personal
differences. In the third phase, students actively discuss the new knowledge among themselves
and with their teacher, with a view to understanding the new construct of information they have
created by connecting prior knowledge to the new information. Students are encouraged to express
their points of view and elaborate or clarify different points of view to help them to refine and edit
their construct accordingly. In the fourth phase, students produce new knowledge. In the fifth
phase, students reflect on the applications of the new information. In this manner, the students
continually add new information to their construct and reorganize it as the contexts of applications
change (Clements, 1997).
Kim (2005) proposes three essential distinctions between the constructivism method of
teaching and other methods. First, in constructivism, the learning process is a process of adding
new knowledge to the prior construct rather than acquiring knowledge from instruction. Second,
teaching facilitates the constructive learning process, more than just transmits new information to
learners. Finally, Kim concludes with the most important difference, which is that teaching comes
after learning in importance. Learning and learners are the core of the education process and
teaching needs to depend on them.

9

Marlowe and Page (2005) suggests four principles to implement the constructivist model
in the classroom: The first principle is that learning is constructing knowledge instead of only
receiving it, so teaching is a practical way to help learners construct their knowledge. The second
principle is that teaching should facilitate thinking and analyzing, not accumulating and
memorizing. For instance, teachers can enable students to construct their knowledge by planning
activities such as discussion, role-play, presentation, etc. The third principle is that teaching should
help students to understand and apply concepts, not to parrot information they have stored in their
mind. The last principle is that teaching should not be passive, one-way interaction, but an active
exchange.
Yager (1995) suggests some procedures of the Constructivist Learning Model (CLM): the
teacher may use students’ questions and thoughts to guide lessons, encourage students to generate
ideas, modify lesson plans based on students’ thoughts, experiences, and interests, pose openended questions which motivate students to elaborate and respond, encourage students to elaborate
on each other’s ideas, apply cooperative learning strategies; provide a suitable time for reflection
and analysis, and accept and apply students’ ideas.
2.2.1 The Effect of the Constructivist Approach on Students’ Achievement.
There exist a number of theories about which multiple factors affect EFL students’
academic achievement. Some educators believe background, individual experiences and gender
are the main factors (Porfeli, Chuang, Audette, McColl, & Algozzine, 2009; Sheard, 2009), but
others maintain that individual factors, such as personality, motivation, and attitude influence
learners’ academic achievement (Sparks, Ganschow, Humbach, & Javorsky, 2006; Bernaus &
Gardner, 2008). For instance, Mahfouz and Himeideh (2009) found that Jordanian university
students have significantly different attitudes toward computer-assisted language learning methods

10

according to their gender, their teachers, and their computer programs. This difference in attitude
towards learning the language may lead to different levels of academic achievement. Likewise,
learning strategies has been suggested as a factor which may influence learners’ academic
achievement. Some studies show that high-achieving learners use learning strategies more
frequently than low-achieving learners. High-achievers adopt more than the surface strategies
needed to complete the task quickly without an in-depth interest in the task (Aharony, 2006;
Selcuk, Caliskan, & Erol, 2007). Kim (2005) investigated the effects of a constructivist approach
on the academic achievement in Mathematics self-concept and learning strategies of elementary
students. In his study, 76 six-grade students were divided into groups: the experimental group was
taught using the constructivist approach for a total of 40 hours in nine weeks, while the control
group received Mathematics instruction using traditional methods. Kim’s findings indicate that:
(1) constructivist teaching is more effective than traditional teaching in students’ academic
achievement; (2) constructivist teaching also has effect on students’ motivation towards learning.
In other words, the students who received constructivist instruction not only performed better than
those who did not, but also had more positive attitudes towards the subject.
2.3 The Cooperative Learning Theory
Cooperative learning is a method intended to encourage a high level of cognitive
understanding. It provides an opportunity for students to co-operate with other students at different
levels of ability in the classroom. This style of learning encourages students to innovate, create,
and collaborate, resulting in a unique and successful learning atmosphere (McCracken, 2005).
Research on cooperative learning has resulted in a teaching method in which small groups
or partners of varying ability levels work together to maximize learning strengths and achieve
shared goals (Moore, 1995). Two theoretical perspectives govern the philosophies of most

11

researchers regarding cooperative learning: The first suggests that learning occurs when students
interact. Wheelock & Hawley (1992) found that males frequently attempt to collaborate with
others of equal capabilities to complete assigned tasks for reasons of encouragement. Wheelock &
Hawley (1992) also found that females often collaborate with other females with equal abilities
because they are responding to a social interaction established in their relationships. The second
perspective to cooperative learning sheds light on the notion that differences in abilities among
learners can reflect a greater development of learners’ understanding (Hoffman, 2002). Teachers
often notice that students are motivated to collaborate in tasks with partners of higher ability
(Davin, & Donato, 2013).
Cooperative learning enhances student communication skills. It can also improve
relationships among peers and minimize disruptions in the classroom. Research has reported that
cooperative learning in the classroom may promote academic achievement, critical thinking,
positive attitudes toward the subject, higher self-esteem and mutual respect among learners (Pettit,
2011). Students who are bored during class or lose interest due to the complexity of the lesson
often disrupt the class. In classrooms with cooperative learning, the problem of negative behavior
is decreased when students engage in productive tasks provided by the teacher (McDougall, 2013).
Encouraging students of equal abilities to cooperate with each other may motivate students to
demonstrate their knowledge mutually, providing students the opportunity for deeper
understanding (McDougall, 2013). However, when cooperative learning is structured between
students of different capabilities, it may benefit social interaction in student-to-student
relationships and build social development (Moore, 1995).
To apply cooperative learning method effectively in the classroom, students and teachers
need to understand what cooperative learning is (Johnson, Johnson, & Smith, 1998). Teachers have

12

to know how to encourage cooperative learning in the classroom and which social skills are
important to be practiced and developed (Johnson, Johnson, & Smith, 1991). Teachers may need
to obtain pedagogical as well as practical knowledge of cooperative learning before they start to
teach because unmastered CL techniques may do more harm than good (Jacobs, 2006).
2.3.1 The Effect of Cooperative Learning on Students’ Achievement
Many previous studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of cooperative
learning on learners in different fields of education. Between 1970 and 1999, approximately 77%
of the research on cooperative learning and student achievement was conducted at primary school
levels. During the same period, less than 24% of the research focused on the achievement of
college students (Johnson, Johnson, & Stanne, 2000). Previously, Johnson, Johnson, and Smith
(1998) reported that studies were conducted between 1924 and 1997 investigated the effects of
cooperative, individualistic and competitive learning methods on students’ achievement in college
learning settings. Approximately, 55% of the studies reported on the effects of all three learning
methods on the achievement of students of 18 years or older. Results indicated that cooperative
learning promoted higher individual achievement than individualistic and competitive learning.
Fiechtner and Davis (1984) selected a sample of college students enrolled in upper-division
speech communication and business policy courses at two major southwestern universities. Using
a survey, they questioned the students about their classroom group experiences in college classes.
The survey covered areas such as group structuring, types of activities, two types of class
assignments: in-class and out of class, and methods of grading. The findings provided some insight
into how college students work in groups on class assignments. Responses to the Fiechtner and
Davis (1984) survey showed that 78% of students displayed positive attitudes toward group
experiences in the class. Moreover, the type and number of group activities made a considerable

13

difference in students’ perception of the learning process. The types of group learning activities
mentioned in the survey were research projects, class presentations, written reports, and group
exams. The survey showed an increase in the number of these types of group activities produced
various effects. In terms of assignments, it also showed that when more class time was devoted to
group work, students spent more time working together outside of class and created more positive
group experiences.
Joritz-Nakagawa published a study on the implementation of cooperative learning in a
university-level English reading course in Japan and reported that cooperative learning in her class
had positive results. For instance, her students commented that they felt a sense of achievement
and increased self-confidence after their group project (Joritz-Nakagawa, 2006). Joritz-Nakagawa
believed that students enjoyed the reading course since the class structure with cooperative
learning created opportunities for communication and interaction between students in the class, an
enjoyable experience. Moreover, cooperative learning enabled the students to have ownership of
and authority over their decision-making processes when they were accomplishing tasks in groups,
in addition to the stimulating and challenging global topics, the students were to learn.
2.4 Learners’ Motivation for Learning a Foreign Language
Learning a foreign language can be difficult in first language (FL) settings, where authentic
language input may be unavailable outside the classroom. In this case, motivation to learn the
language plays a significant role in the learner’s journey to success.
Motivation has been suggested by researchers as one of the main variables that determine
the level and success of learning a second language. Gardner (1985, p. 63) defines L2 motivation
as "the extent to which the individual works or strives to learn the language because of a desire to
do so and the satisfaction experienced”. Interestingly, Dornyei (2001) has noted that the teacher
plays a central role in motivating learners to learn the language. In his view, motivation may be
14

the reason for selecting a particular activity, the willingness to persist in it, the effort which is
invested in it, the teacher’s charisma, approachability and methods may influence all three
components which parallel with learners’ goals and the maintenance of the learning effort.
Learners have various reasons for learning and acquiring any foreign language, which may
also influence their motivation. Many researchers have attempted to define motivation to learn a
second language, resulting in various theories, such as the socio-educational model (Gardner,
1985), according to which learners’ motivation to learn the second language is influenced by
integration and attitude toward learning. Integration is the learner’s attitude toward the second
language group of people and interest in learning the language in which they communicate. A
learner’s attitude toward learning the target language can be influenced by the mode of the
language course and by the teacher. In the socio-educational model, a learner’s motivation to learn
a second language consists of three elements: (1) effort that the learner provides to achieve a goal,
(2) desire to learn the language, and (3) attitude toward learning the language (Alothman &
Shuqair, 2013).
Teachers can enhance students’ motivation by providing enjoyable learning experiences
(Karlsson, 1996). Increased student motivation may enhance learning which facilitates increasing
students’ achievement because students are consciously and practically engaged in the learning
experience (Barry & King, 1993; Galloway, Rogers, Armstrong, & Leo, 1998). Therefore, it is
important for teachers to search for appropriate approaches to teach English, especially in an
environment in which English language is rarely used outside the classroom. It would be helpful
for teachers to use instructional methods that enhance the English learning capacity and
proficiency of their students.

15

While the motivation of EFL students to learning English has been investigated by some
researchers in the Arab world, few studies exist on the constructivist approach. Alothman and
Shuqair (2013) have studied motivation for English language learning by eliciting observations of
researchers in the area, who reported that methods which are generally used to teach English do
not usually focus on the students’ motivation. Nevertheless, they report that learning which
includes problem-solving tasks has helped learners be interested in the language that they need to
acquire by involving them in the learning process, resulting greater motivation to learn English
Alothman & Shuqair (2013).
2.4.1 Aspects of Motivation
Motivation to learn a foreign language has two significant aspects; these are instrumental
motivation and integrative motivation (Gardner and Lambert, 1972).
2.4.1.1 Instrumental Motivation
Learners with an instrumental motivation have a practical reason to learn a foreign
language such as earning a high salary or enrolling in college. For example, many college-level
language learners have an instrumental motivation to learn a foreign language to fulfill a college
language requirement.
2.4.1.2 Integrative Motivation
An integratively motivated learner has the desire to learn a second language to understand
the second language speakers. He or she may be interested in the culture of speakers of that
language, or in a part of it, such as music, art, or dance. For example, some Arabic speakers may
be motivated to learn English, so they can live abroad easily.

16

2.4.2 Determinants of Learner Motivation
Motivation is the most significant factor in students’ performance and achievement in learning
(Gardner, 1985). There are some determinants which may affect the learner’s success in learning.
These determiners can be summarized as: interest, classroom environment, and society.
2.4.2.1 Interest
The teacher can create an interesting lesson to motivate students by using different new
techniques and approaches. For instance, the teacher may apply cooperative and constructive
learning methods which may be an effective tool to create an interesting lesson, especially to learn
a second language.
2.4.2.2. Classroom Environment
The teacher should make the classroom a stimulating, active, and enjoyable place to learn
and practice language skills, instead of the classroom environment being serious and formal. For
instance, role-play or acting out short skits using partial costumes or wigs can be very fun and
provide practice in L2. Also, it is important to integrate humor into the learning environment too.
2.4.2.3. Society
The society surrounding the learner may have a considerable influence on his or her attitude
towards learning a specific language. When students enter the classroom, they may bring with
them the prevailing societal attitude towards the second language, which can be positive or
negative. Some Arab-speakers may associate English with Western cultural mores that they
consider anti-Islamic, for instance, and this will affect their attitude towards the language. The
influence of the home society is reduced when the learner is living in the society of the speakers
of L2; one of the reasons why language courses are often taught abroad.

17

2.4.3 Types of Motivation
Deci and Ryan (1985)- in the self-determination theory- distinguish two basic components
of motivation based on the different reasons or goals behind an action—intrinsic and
extrinsic motivation.
2.4.3.1 Intrinsic Motivation
Intrinsic motivation is internal and occurs when learners accomplish something out of
desire. Learners may be engaged in activities to satisfy their interests. Moreover, learners may
work on the task because there is some reward for completing it, such as a prize, a higher payment,
or grades in the case of students.
Students who have intrinsic motivation are inclined to persevere in intricate problems and
acquire knowledge from their mistakes (Walker, Greene, & Mansell, 2006). Intrinsic motivation
is essential and significant for the process by which the person’s new knowledge is assimilated
into prior knowledge.
2.4.3.2 Extrinsic Motivation
Extrinsic motivation refers to external factors which lead learners to behave in a certain
way to achieve important goals. This type of motivation may be the tendency to participate, or not,
in activities because of factors which are not linked to the activity. These factors may be an
anticipation of reward or punishment, like passing or failing the exam or earning higher or lower
grades (Vansteenkiste, Lens, & Deci, 2006). Extrinsic motivation can force learners to do
something they do not enjoy. Teachers should use motivational techniques and strategies to
increase students’ effort toward achieving their goals, especially with students who are not
intrinsically motivated.

18

In sum, intrinsic motivation is the motivation to do any task because the task itself is
interesting and enjoyable. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is the motivation to accomplish
a task as a means of achieving a target or a specific goal.
2.4.4 Motivation and Language Learning
Motivation is an essential part of learning, and it can have significant impact on whether
the L2 student is successful or not. According to Gardner (1885), it is necessary for the learner to
have something to anticipate as a reason to achieve the goal. In the case of EFL learners, attainment
of fluency could be the goal. Cook (2000) has reported that the performance of some learners of
foreign language is better than others since they are better motivated. Ellis (1994, p. 508) believes
that motivation can be fostered by the teacher, saying “language teachers readily acknowledge the
importance of learners’ motivation, not infrequently explaining their own sense of failure with
reference to their students, lack of motivation”. Cook (2000) states that acquisition of any language
is different for each learner because there are three main factors which influence language
acquisition: age, personality, and motivation. The latter is the most significant among the factors
that affect language acquisition. Ellis (1994, p. 715) sees motivation as “the effort which learners
put into learning an L2 as a result of their need or desire to learn it”. Likewise, Lightbrown and
Spada (2001, p.33) believe that motivation in second language acquisition is a complicated force
which can be described by “learners’ communicative needs and their attitudes towards the second
language community”.
Considering the role of motivation in the teaching process can be effective and helpful. The
teacher’s awareness of learners’ attitudes and relating them to the teaching process may provide a
guide to more useful and more effective methods for teaching a language. For instance, foreign
language teachers have known that relating the L2 to music popular and contemporary to learners

19

is useful and effective. Briefly, motivation can be defined as a physical, psychological or social
need which encourages learners to reach or achieve goals, fulfill their needs, and feel satisfied with
achieving their aims. Undoubtedly, the language teacher has a significant role augmenting or
diminishing the motivation for learners to learn the language.
2.4.5 Relevant Studies on Motivation and Language Learning
Many studies have been undertaken to investigate the relationship between motivation and
learning language and to discuss the effect of motivation factors on the learning process. For
instance, Yang (2012) conducted a simple study on 20 Master students in Malaysia, aimed at
measuring students’ attitude and motivation towards learning L2 and investigating the reasons
behind differences in levels of acquiring and learning English. Results showed that students were
highly motivated towards learning English since they were highly invested in their English
proficiency. Some learners are motivated to learn English to obtain a job in their fields and some
of them learn English since they prefer people who speak English and their cultures. In a 2011
study, Latifah, Mansor, Ramli, Wardah, & Ng Man examined the correlation of motivation,
attitude, anxiety, and instrumental orientation with university students’ performance in English.
The sample consisted of 757 university students in Open University Malaysia. Findings showed
that there was a relationship between students’ performance and their motivation and attitude, in
which motivation and attitude had a positive effect on performance. In a similar study with 112
English- major students at Umm Al-Qura University in Saudi Arabia, Alsamadani & Ibnian (2015)
found that students’ motivation and attitude were directly correlated with their grade point average
(GPA). In other words, students who were highly motivated and had a positive attitude towards
learning English had high GPAs in English.

20

To conclude, learners’ motivation towards learning a language is complex and challenging.
Also, encouraging Arabic L1 speakers to learn English, because of the religious, cultural and
syntactical differences, is not easy. However, it is possible to enhance students’ motivation by
various means.
2.5 The 5Es Model
The constructivist theory may be applied to many different teaching models, one of which
is the 5Es. Based on the constructivist approach, Roger Bybee developed the instructional model
of learning called the “Five Es” in 1997. It depends on providing a way for learners to construct
an accurate understanding of a new concept based on existing knowledge, because instruction may
not be effective when teachers explain a new concept without connecting it to students’ prior
knowledge. The 5Es model promotes experiential learning by motivating and encouraging students
to learn new information by depending on their existing experience.
In addition, the 5Es method incorporates the cooperative learning approach, which
provides learners the opportunity to use group work for better results in the classroom.
Cooperative learning may be useful to apply the 5Es model in classrooms since learning as
individuals encourages students’ tendency to hide their knowledge or experiences, and not share
with other learners (Johnson & Johnson, 1990).
The 5Es instructional model focuses on dealing with the learning process as a collection of
experiences, explorations, explanations, and evaluations. This learning model consists of five
phases: engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. Herein, I will elaborate
on each phase.

21

2.5.1 Engagement
In this phase, learners are exposed to new concepts, and it is expected for them to connect
these concepts with existing experiences to have a deep understanding (Bybee, 2009). According
to İşcan (2014), in this phase, the learners should be given activities that would arouse their
curiosity, exhibit their prior knowledge, and reveal their interest in the new concept, since the
primary purpose of this phase is to capture learners’ imagination (Swanage & Lane, 1999). The
implementation of this phase is successful if students are actively motivated to inquire and learn
(Bybee, 1997). Asking an open question, showing students a clip with an event related to the topic,
and acting out a problematic situation are all activities to engage the students into the topic.
2.5.2 Exploration
This phase focuses on acquiring an accurate understanding of the concept to avoid
misconception and to generate new ideas and results (Bybee, 2009). For instance, learners can
answer questions about the new concept (İşcan, 2014). It is designed to provide to students some
practical experiences, allowing them to build on their existing concepts and skills. In this phase,
students are effectively exploring new concepts.
2.5.3 Explanation
At this stage, learners are supposed to critically explain their ideas and understanding to
others after exploring new ideas and engaging them with the prior experience (Bybee, 2009). The
teacher may provide an explanation of the new concept to direct the learners to a deeper
understanding (İşcan, 2014). It gives the opportunity for students to explain their findings. These
explanations obviously need to be connected to the engagement and exploration activities
(Swanage & Lane, 1999). Essentially, students are involved in a learning environment that
motivates them to explain their concepts and understandings.

22

2.5.4 Elaboration
This phase encourages learners to apply what they explored and understood to develop a
deeper understanding of the concept (Bybee, 2009). The teacher’s role in this phase is to
concentrate on elaborating on learners’ understanding and skills (İşcan, 2014). Thus, students
have the opportunity to extend their existing knowledge of concepts to other contexts in different
situations.
2.5.5 Evaluation
Students, in this phase, have the opportunity to evaluate their understanding and participate
with their teachers to assess their achievement and development (Bybee, 2009), providing a clear
picture of how learners understood and enhanced their prior experience and knowledge. Their
understandings may also be evaluated more formally.
2.6 Relevant Research on the 5Es Model
Since Rodger Bybee put forward the 5Es model in 1997, many have investigated the
application of this model. The 5Es model has been widely applied in science and social fields.
Moseley and Reinke (2002) applied the 5Es in their lessons through activities in which students
had to develop cartoons and stickers to change people’s attitudes towards the environment and its
problems. Keser (2003) designed a constructivist learning medium based on the 5Es regarding
Electromagnetic Induction and applied it to high school classes. Results showed that the model
was appropriate structure for the application. Likewise, Boddy, Watson, and Aubusson (2003) and
Newby (2004) applied the 5Es model to teach students in primary school. They found that the 5Es
model made the class interesting and funny, increased student interest in lessons, and raised the
order of students’ thinking. Ögeyik (2009) published a study entitled “Using the 5E Model in
History Education: A Sample Study for English Language Teaching Classes” in which the

23

researcher applied the 5Es model to teach History classes and found that it increased motivation
and success among learners.
In the English learning context, Cazibe Yiğit (2011) conducted a study on 70 students
studying English at Trakya University in Turkey to investigate the effect of the 5Es model on
students’ achievement and motivation towards writing. Results indicated that the applied program
had a positive effect on students’ achievement and motivation towards writing.
The progression of the 5Es can be followed in a single lesson and also on a larger scale
throughout the curriculum. Each lesson taught using the model can incorporate aspects of some
phases, and each phase should be evident in the implementation of the unit as a whole (Bybee,
1997).
In sum, applying the 5Es model of learning based on both the constructivist and cooperative
learning approaches can be a new model to teach English to EFL learners in Saudi Arabia.
According to Carr et al. (2006), English learners, as learners in other fields, should have the
opportunity to connect their prior knowledge with the new one. A suitable way to build this
connection may be the application of the 5Es model of learning.
2.7 Summary
The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between female EFL female learners’
academic achievement and the use of the constructivist approach, by means of the 5Es model.
Although there exist studies to investigate the relationship between the 5Es method of teaching
and academic achievement in science, few studies in the Saudi context have explored the
effectiveness of applying this model to EFL learners. This is a gap which the present research aims
to begin to address.

CHAPTER THREE - METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the research design and analyses performed to
answer the research questions as follow:
Research question 1. Are there any significant differences between the scores of the
experimental and control groups on post-tests of Saudi female EFL students’ motivation and
achievement?
Research question 2. Are there any significant differences between the mean scores of the
pre- and post-tests of motivation and achievement of the experimental group of Saudi female EFL
students, the experimental group having received the treatment of instruction using the 5Es model?
In the following sections of this chapter, the researcher discusses the research plan, data
collection methods and procedures, data analysis, and provides summary of the chapter.
3.2 Research Design
A quantitative methodology was used for this study. For the experimental group, the
researcher designed a program of teaching based on the 5Es model to be followed for ten weeks
during the first semester of the academic year 2017-2018, focusing on the four language skills:
reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Students’ proficiency level was evaluated by a pre-test
and a post-test. In addition to the program and the achievement test, the researcher used Gardner’s
Attitude / Motivation Test Battery (AMI) (1960) questionnaire to collect data.

25

3.2.1 Statistical Method.
The researcher performed a t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Cronbach’s Alpha and
Split-half (Spearman-Brown) to analyze the data. The t-test was used to check the reliability of the
pre and post-tests. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to verify content validity of the useable
questionnaire. Cronbach’s Alpha and Split-half (Spearman-Brown) was used to check the
reliability of the questionnaire.
3.2.2 Variables.
The independent variable for this study was the teaching program used to investigate the
effectiveness of the 5Es model on learners’ achievement and motivation toward learning English.
The dependent variables in this study were: 1) the students’ achievement on EFL exams
and 2) the students’ motivation to learn English. To measure these variables, the students’ scores
on English Language Center (ELC) end-of-semester final exams were used. For this exam,
students took a listening test with 10 multiple-choice questions based on audio materials, answered
10 questions testing their understanding of a reading comprehension passage, a further 10
questions on grammar and vocabulary, wrote a paragraph, and took a speaking test. The listening
and speaking test were prepared for each group by the researcher whereas the reading portions
were constructed by the ELC Testing Unit, based on the students’ textbook English Unlimited
Special Edition 1 (Doff, 2015). The experimental group of students and the control group took the
same exams.
3.3 Pilot Study
Forty-nine female students in their first year at Taif University were randomly chosen from
the College of Science for the pilot study. Their ages ranged from 17 to 23 years old, M= 18.592,
Sd= 2.030. All of them were Saudis. The aim of the pilot study was to determine the amount of

26

time required to complete the questionnaire and to determine the validity and the reliability of the
motivation questionnaire. Also, it was conducted to determine the weaknesses and strengths of the
questionnaire and to examine the suitability of the statistical analyses used to analyze the collected
data of the main study.
3.4 Participants of the Main Study
The study was conducted in the 2017-2018 academic year on female students in their first
year at the College of Science in Taif University. The sample consisted of 119 students who were
randomly divided into an experimental and a control group. Their age ranged from 18-23 years,
M= 18.740, SD= 1.004. The experimental group consisted of 58 students aged 18-20 years, M=
18.655, SD= 0.947, whereas the control group consisted of 61 students aged 18-23, M= 18.200,
SD= 1.057. All the participants were enrolled in an obligatory English course of 6 hours per week.
3.5 Instruments for Data Collection
Data were collected using quantitative methods. a standardized survey with 5-point Likertlike responses, and English achievement tests.
3.5.1 Motivation Questionnaire for the Current Study
To measure motivation for this study, a questionnaire was used that featured a 5-point
Likert-like scale, which 27 statements were adapted from the original 7-point Likert-scale format
of Gardner’s Attitude/ Motivation Test Battery (AMI) (1960). This questionnaire, adopted by
many researchers to identify L2 motivation, featured choices from ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly
Agree’ (Gardner, 1960). Fifteen items were added by the researcher to the Gardner questionnaire
to be more appropriate for EFL Saudi university students and the 5Es program. The added items
are: 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 29, 30, 34, 35, and 42. The motivation questionnaire is a set
of questions to identify the increase or decrease of learners’ motivation toward learning English

27

after receiving the treatment of 5Es instruction. In the first part of the questionnaire, participants
provided demographic and personal information (name, age, major, and level). In the second part,
42 items were divided into nine categories to facilitate the analysis. Each item was presented with
a 5-point Likert scale and participants were asked to circle or check one of the five given points
(1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3=neither agree nor disagree, 4= agree, 5= strongly agree).
The questionnaire was translated into Arabic by the researcher, and the translation was
reviewed by two ELC faculty members at Taif University who are specialized in translation. The
precision of the translation was important and verified to avert any confusion in comprehension
because the participants are beginners in EFL.
The nine categories of the motivation questionnaire are: instrumental motivation (social
factor) (3 items), integrative motivation (social factor) (6 items), extrinsic motivation (attitudinal
factor) (5 items), intrinsic motivation- self-confidence- ( attitudinal factor) (6 items), external
encouragement (impact of social factor on attitudinal factor) (5 items), intrinsic motivationintegrative orientation- (attitudinal factor) (5 items), extrinsic motivation (teacher and peer
students) (5 items), recapitulation of instrumental/integrative motivation (3 items), and selfassessment of the use of English outside the class, motivation and the English class (4 items).
The questionnaire items that measured instrumental motivation (social factor) were 1,
2, and 3. Items that measured integrative motivation (social factor) were 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; items
that measured extrinsic motivation (attitudinal factor) were 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. As for intrinsic
motivation- self-confidence- ( attitudinal factor), items were 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. External
encouragement (impact of the social factor on attitudinal factor) items were 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.
Intrinsic motivation- integrative orientation- (attitudinal factor) items were 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30.
Extrinsic motivation (teacher and peer students) items were 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35. Recapitulation

28

of instrumental/integrative motivation items were 36, 37, and 38. Finally, self- assessment of the
use of English outside the class, motivation and the English class items were 39, 40, 41, and 42.
3.5.1.1 Validity of Questionnaire on Motivation
To verify content validity, the questionnaire was submitted to 2 experts from the ELC and
Foreign Language Department to verify that each item belonged to its dimension, and to correct
items if an adjustment was required. To verify its construction validity, the researcher performed
the calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, as show in Table 3.1 below:

As illustrated in Table 3.1, all items have a significant correlation with the total score at
level 0.01. Three items (15, 17 and 20) do not correlate significantly with the total score of their
dimension, so they were omitted. The final number of the measurement items is 39 items,
indicating validity for the measurement.
5.1.1.2 Reliability of the Questionnaire on Motivation Towards Learning English
The researcher calculated the reliability of the questionnaire by two methods: Cronbach’s
Alpha and Split-half (Spearman-Brown) as shown in Table 3.2 below:

As shown in Table 3.2, the reliability coefficient was very high for both Cronbach’s Alpha
and Split-half as the coefficients were 0.852 and 0.913 respectively, indicating that the reliability
30

for the total score of motivation in learning English measurement is high. For dimensions methods,
Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient ranged from 0.610 to 0.798, and for Split-half it ranged from 0.667
to 0.852. Coefficients for both methods are high.
3.5.2 English Achievement Test
The achievement test used in this study was divided into three parts: a listening test, a
speaking test, and reading & writing test. To avoid subjectivity on part of the researcher the reading
and writing portions of the third test (both pre and post-test) were constructed by the Testing Unit
of the ELC, comprised of assigned, experienced, male and female teachers from Taif University.
3.5.2.1 Listening Portion of the Midterm and Final Exams
The researcher designed listening assessments for the midterm and the final. There were
five multiple-choice questions to be answered on the midterm and ten multiple-choice questions
on the final. The listening assessments were administered by the researcher before the reading and
writing exams. For both the experimental and the control groups were divided into two groups to
maintain quiet and so two different versions of the test could be used. Although audio materials
were taken from the course packet, the questions were different from the exercises in the book,
making comprehension truer. The students had to read the questions before listening; the recording
was only played twice.
3.5.2.2 Speaking Portion of the Midterm and Final Exams
The researcher designed speaking assessments for the midterm and the final. Each
comprised two parts: (1) the student had to respond to questions about general personal
information; and (2) respond to questions about a specific topic chosen from those suggested in
the course book. Speaking assessments were administered by the researcher before the reading and
writing exams. For both the experimental and the control groups, the researcher assessed the

31

students’ speaking ability in both the experimental and the control groups by asking open-ended
questions, thus enabling students to display understanding of the topic, language use, fluency, and
accuracy. Although the topics were taken from the course book, the open-ended questions were
not those proposed in the book.
3.5.2.3 Reading and Writing Portions of the Midterm Exam
The reading and writing portions of the midterm and the final were constructed by the
Testing Unit of the ELC at Taif University. One hour was allocated for both reading and writing
exam. The possible total of 20 points for the midterm reading and writing exam were divided as
follows: reading comprehension - 5 questions; language – 10 questions (vocabulary - 5 questions
and grammar - 5 questions); and writing – 2 questions. Each question in a multiple-choice format
was allocated 1 point except for the writing test which was divided into two parts: (1) put the parts
of a sentence in the correct order with 1 point and (2) write a paragraph worth 4 points. The text
for the reading comprehension was taken from the course book. Two versions of the same exam
were prepared, in which the questions were identical, but the multiple-choice answers were
scrambled.
3.5.2.4 Reading and Writing Portions of the Final Exam
The reading and writing portions of the final exam were constructed by the same ELC
Testing Unit as at the midterm; however, 2 hours were allocated (for both reading and writing
exam) for their completion at the end of the academic semester. There were 30 points for the
reading section of the exam, divided as follows: reading comprehension - 10 questions; language
– 20 questions (vocabulary - 10 questions; and grammar - 10 questions). Each question in a
multiple-choice format was allocated 1 point. In addition to the reading section, the writing section
was worth 10 points. The writing portion consisted of one question for putting the elements of a

32

sentence in the correct order, one on finding a mistake with 1 point for each and writing a paragraph
worth 8 points. In general, the final exam was based on content from the course book. Although
the reading comprehension text was chosen from the course book, the questions were different
from the exercises in the book. Two versions of the final exam were prepared, on which the
questions were identical, but the multiple-choice answers were scrambled.
The English achievement tests assessed learners’ development; in the experimental group
through implementation of the 5Es model, and for those who received traditional instruction in the
control group.
3.5.3 The 5Es Program
The same lessons from the course book were taught to both groups, with two different
methods for ten weeks; each group received 20 sessions, two sessions per week, for two hours
each session. The traditional method was used to teach the control group, while the 5Es learning
model was applied in the experimental group’s classes. The experimental group students were
given materials such as worksheets, flashcards, PowerPoint presentations, audios, pictures,
posters…etc., which were prepared by the researcher according to the 5Es learning model, besides
the course book which was designed to teach English through the 5Es model. The materials and
the course book were designed to encourage students to ask, think, explore and search to learn new
information depending on the existing experience. The researcher chose 20 different topics from
the coursebook which were: introduce yourself, where you live, families, where you work,
describe a street, time, if you are free, what you like and don’t like, describe a restaurant or café,
how people spend their free time, things in shops, how much things are, what clothes you wear,
your daily routine, how to get to places, weekend and holidays, what you did last weekend, where

33

you were, a place you visit, and months and weather. Both the experimental group and the control
group were instructed by the researcher.
3.6 Research Procedures and Data Collection
This study is a quantitative study for which a total of 119 female students were randomly
selected from beginner-level English in the College of Science. Data were collected from the
Learning Motivation questionnaire and from their grades on their midterm and final English
exams.
The Learning Motivation questionnaire was administered to all the participants by the
researcher before and after the treatment of the instruction by the 5Es model (to the experimental
group) or the instruction by traditional methods (to the control group). First, the researcher
explained the concept of learning motivation to the students, assured them that their participation
was only for research and that their responses would not affect their grades in any way. Then, she
encouraged the participants to read the statements carefully and pay attention to the Likert-like
scales. The students’ achievement data were obtained from their grades on the midterm and final
exams for their English class. A t-test was used to compare between experimental and control
groups.
3.7 Summary
In sum, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of using the 5Es model on
first-year EFL students’ achievement and on their motivation towards learning English. In order
to achieve the aims, the researcher adopted a quasi-experimental design by dividing the sample
into a control group who received traditional English instruction, and into an experimental group
who received instruction using the 5Es model. Both groups completed pre- and post- achievement

34

tests and pre- and post- questionnaires on motivation. A pilot study was conducted prior to the
study to confirm the validity and reliability of the adopted questionnaire.

35

CHAPTER FOUR - FINDINGS
4.1 Introduction
This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of applying the 5Es model on
EFL learners’ achievement and on their motivation toward learning English. The findings of the
data analyses are reported in the following pages of this chapter.
4.2 Research questions
This research proposed to pursue answers to the following two research questions:
1)

Are there significant differences between the scores of the experimental group and those

of the control group on the post-tests measuring the English achievement and motivation of female
Saudi EFL students? Hypothesis 1 (H1) is that there are statistically significant differences
between the post-tests of the control and experiment group. The alternate null hypothesis (H0) is
that there are no differences or that they are not statistically significant.
2)

Are there are significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of

motivation and English achievement for members of the experimental group? To answer this
question, hypothesis 2 (H2) is that there are statistically significant differences between the mean
scores of the experimental group’s pre- and post-test. The alternate null hypothesis (H0) is that
there are no differences or that they are not statistically significant.
The sample of this study included 119 female students whose age ranged from 18-23 years
M=18.740, SD= 1.004. The sample population (n = 119) was chosen randomly from the first-year
cohort of the College of Science of Taif University, all of whom were enrolled in an obligatory
English course. The participants were divided randomly into two groups: the experimental group
(n1 = 57) and the control group (n2 = 61).

Table 4.1 shows no differences between the control and the experimental group in
achievement, motivation and its factors in pre-tests. This result means that there was equivalence
between the control and experimental groups before starting the treatment of 5Es program.
4.3 Findings Concerning Research Question 1
4.3.1 Test of hypothesis one

37

The hypothesis corresponding to the first research question is that there are significant
differences between the experimental group’s mean scores and the control group’s mean scores on
the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students` motivation and achievement in favor of the
experimental group. To test this hypothesis, the researcher performed an Independent Samples ttest, and the results are reported in Table 4.2 below:

Table 4.2 shows that there exist statistically significant differences between the mean
scores of the experimental and control groups on post-tests of the students’ achievement t (117) =
3.627, p ≤ 0.001, in favour of the experimental group. For social factors t (117) = 5.415, P ≤0.001,
for Integrative motivation t (117) = 4.884, P ≤ 0. 001, for instrumental orientation t (117) = 5.579,
P ≤ 0.001, Self-confidence t (117) = 2.830, P ≤ 0 .005, External encouragement t (117) = 5.229, P
≤ 0. 001; integrative orientation t (117) = 5.007, P ≤0.001; for teacher and peers t (117) = 2.589, P
≤0.01; for Recapitulation of instrumental t (117) = 3.464, P ≤0.001, for Self-assessment of the use
of English outside the class t (117) = 3.794 P ≤0.001 and for total scores of motivation t (117) =
7.813 P ≤0.001. This refers to the effectiveness of the 5Es program that was used with this sample
and the content of each session was suitable for the learners’ level. In view of these findings, for
research question 1, hypothesis 1, or H1 is accepted and the corresponding null hypothesis, H0, is
rejected. The following Figure 4.1 illustrates these values:

4.4 Findings Concerning Research Question 2
4.3.2 Test of hypothesis two
The hypothesis corresponding to the second research question is that there are significant
differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of the experimental group’s
motivation and achievement in favor of the post-test. To test hypothesis 2 corresponding to this
research question, the researcher performed a paired sample t-test and the results are shown in

As shown in Table 4.3, there exist statistically significant differences between the mean
scores of the pre-tests and post-tests of achievement and motivation of the members of the
experimental group of EFL female Saudi students; t (57) = 5.208, p ≤0.001 in favor of the posttest. In addition, there are significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and posttests of social factors t (57) = 9.021, p ≤0.001 in favor of the post test. as well as on their` factors
of motivation: for social factors t (57) = 2.602, p ≤0.01, for Integrative motivation t (57) = 4.039,

4.5 Summary
In this chapter, the researcher attempted to analyze all data needed to answer the two
research questions: (1) Are there any significant differences between the experimental group
scores and the control group scores on the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation
and their achievement? and (2) Are there any significant differences between the mean scores of
the pre-tests and post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement
for the experimental group? Some major findings emerged from the analyses of the data. As a
conclusion for this chapter, these are some of the major results:
43

1. The two hypotheses of this study were accepted and the alternate null hypotheses were
rejected.
2. There were statistically significant differences between the experimental group and the
control group on the post-tests of the students’ achievement and motivation in favour of
the experimental group, which affirm the effectiveness of the 5Es program treatment
applied to the experimental group. The content of each session was suitable for the learners’
level.
3. There were statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the pre-tests and
post-tests of the experimental group of EFL female Saudi students’ achievement and
motivation, in favor of the post-test.

CHAPTER FIVE – DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
5.1 Introduction
The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of 5Es model instruction to the
achievement of Saudi EFL learners and to their motivation toward learning English. As suggested
in Chapter 1, this study increases extant research-based information on instructional methods that
may be suitable teach to Saudi EFL students with better results. The 5Es model may be employed
to encourage students to assume more responsibility for their own learning as opposed to
traditional instructional methods where the students depend totally on their teachers and receive
passively. The 5Es model of learning is based on the constructivist approach according to which
students construct their own knowledge by adding new material to information they already
possess by engaging in activities that promote self-exploration, cooperative social activity,
discourse and debate. In the 5Es model of instruction, the teacher is not the only source of new
information for the students, as they are encouraged to actively participate in their own learning.
This study is devoted to discover the application of the 5Es model in the context of Saudi
universities and how much this model affects Saudi EFL learners’ achievement and motivation
towards learning English. To assess the effectiveness of the 5Es model, the researcher designed a
teaching program which was applied to an experimental group of participants, while an equivalent
control group received teaching by traditional methods without the 5Es model.
5.2 The 5Es Model and EFL Learners’ Achievement and Motivation
From the analyses of the data, it appears that in the beginning, participants in the control
group of EFL students were equivalent to those in the experimental group of students in both
English achievement and motivation. After 20 sessions of instruction, the students received the

45

treatment of instruction following the 5Es model displayed statistically significant more
achievement and motivation towards learning English than those who had received traditional
instruction whereby the teacher only generates and transfers new information to the students.
It can be concluded that there is a relationship between the use of constructive and
cooperative learning, represented by the 5Es model, and improvement in EFL learners’
achievement and motivation. Even though this study was limited to female, first-year Saudi EFL
learners and cannot be generalized to all Saudi EFL learners, there, nevertheless, exists a strong
possibility that the model could be useful in all EFL classes in Saudi Arabia. Enlightening teachers
about the positive effects of the use of the 5Es model on students’ motivation toward learning
English, and consequently their learning performance and achievement, may be beneficial. This
concurs with the findings of some studies concerned with constructive learning such as Kim
(2005), Aharony (2006), and Selcuk, et al., (2007). After using the constructive approach for nine
weeks, Kim (2005) had found that constructive teaching is more effective than traditional teaching
to teach Mathematics at the elementary level. Aharony (2006) and Selcuk, et al., (2007) had
concluded that high achievers use constructive learning strategies more frequently than low
achievers, adopting deeper strategies than superficial ones made up of the ways to complete the
task fastest without having an in-depth interest in it.
Furthermore, the results of this study also support the conclusions of studies on cooperative
learning such as Fiechtner and Davis (1984) and Joritz-Nakagawa (2006). In the survey of
Fiechtner and Davis (1984), 78% of students displayed positive attitudes toward group experiences
in class and a considerable difference in their perception of the learning process. Also, Fiechtner
and Davis (1984) found that an increase in the number of group activities produced other related
effects. For instance, when more class time was devoted to group work, students spent more time

46

working together outside of class and created more positive group experiences. After the
implementation of cooperative learning in a university-level English reading course, JoritzNakagawa (2006) found that the students enjoyed the reading course more since the class structure
with cooperative learning created opportunities for communication and interaction between
students in the class, to constitute an enjoyable experience.
As for motivation, by eliciting observations of researchers in the field, Alothman and
Shuqair (2013) showed that learning which includes problem-solving tasks may encourage
learners to be interested in the target language and hence involve them in the learning process,
which can result in a more positive motivation to learn English.
5.3 Conclusion and Summary of Findings
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the 5Es model on Saudi EFL learners’
achievement and motivation toward learning English. Findings can be summarized as follow:
1. There are indeed statistically significant differences between the scores of the
experimental and control group on post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and
achievement, leading to the conclusion that teaching with the 5Es model is more effective than
traditional methods.
2. There are indeed significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and posttests of the participants of the experimental group of female Saudi EFL students’ motivation and
achievement, leading to the conclusion that teaching with the 5Es model can bring about better
results than traditional methods.
The study was carried out at Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia, using students in their first
academic year from the College of Science as participants. The study employed qualitative
methods to gain information about Saudi learners’ achievement level after applying the 5Es model

47

as well as their motivation toward learning English. To test the study hypotheses, various data
collection tools were used. The researcher collected the scores of ELC midterm and final exams
on the four language skills: speaking, listening, writing, and reading and a motivation
questionnaire was completed to measure the students’ motivation toward learning English before
and after teaching with the 5Es model. Then, the collected data was analyzed using standard
statistical procedures.
To construct a response to the first research question, statistics were calculated to examine
differences in the achievement and motivation between the control group and the experimental
group. The results of the t-test showed significant differences between the experimental group
mean scores and the control group mean scores on the post-tests of the students’ achievement (t =
3.627) in favor of the experimental group. In addition, results indicated that there are differences
between the mean scores experimental group mean scores and the control group mean scores on
the post-tests of the motivation and its factors in favor of the experimental group. For social factors
(t = 5.415), for integrative motivation (t = 4.884), for instrumental orientation (t = 5.579), selfconfidence (t = 2.830), external encouragement (t = 5.229); integrative orientation (t = 5.007); for
teacher and peers (t = 2.589); for recapitulation of instrumental (t = 3.464), for self-assessment of
the use English outside class (t = 3.794) and for total scores of motivation (t = 7.813).
To respond to the second research question, the data collected to test H2 was the motivation
questionnaire completed by the experimental group and their scores of the ELC midterm and final
exams which included speaking, listening, writing and reading portions. The results of the t-test
showed significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of the EFL
female Saudi students achievement (t = 5.208), in favor of the post-test. Moreover, there are
significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of the EFL female Saudi

48

students’ factors of motivation: for social factors (t = 2.602), for integrative motivation (t = 4.039),
for instrumental orientation (t = 4.474), self-confidence (t = 3.073), external encouragement (t =
3.521); integrative orientation (t = 4.133); for teacher and peers (t = 2.584); for recapitulation of
instrumental (t = 4.338), for self-assessment of use of English outside class (t = 3.566) and for
total scores of motivation (t = 6.907), leading the researcher to the conclusion that the 5Es model
of instruction does indeed affect motivation in a positive direction.
To conclude, the learning of Saudi EFL university-level female students is enhanced when
teachers use constructivist-based methods in their classrooms.

The 5Es model, being a

constructivist approach to teaching, is effective to increase Saudi students’ learning achievement
in English and also increased their motivation to acquire English. Therefore, the 5Es model should
be added to the teachers’ repertoire of teaching methods.
5.4 Pedagogical Implications of the Study
Based on the results and the conclusion, this study seems to raise some implications
regarding using the 5Es model of teaching and learning in EFL contexts. There is a need for
ongoing development in the area of English language teaching among EFL teachers. Teachers
should be encouraged to integrate the 5Es model in their teaching effectively at all levels.
Introducing more materials, tools, and technological resources may help to fill the current learning
gap that is mainly a result of traditional strategies. Hence, it should be stressed that the teachers
should be motivated to be open to use supplement materials and resources that support teaching
English.
5.5 Recommendations for Further Research

49

The aim of this study is the contribution to the field of applied linguistics by investigating
the contribution of the 5Es to enhance EFL learning in Saudi Arabia. However, further research
is needed to further enrich the teachers’ toolbox.
1- It would be useful to conduct similar studies to investigate the effectiveness of the 5Es
model in the teaching of Saudi students at different levels of education (i.e., elementary,
intermediate, high school and different levels of undergraduates and graduates). As Saudi students
begin EFL in elementary school and the results are universally poor, perhaps the 5Es model of
teaching could be effective at levels other than one investigated by the study.
2- It would be interesting to design a similar program using different curricula and general
achievement tests to overcome the limitations of this study. For instance, the existence (or lack of
one) of a gender difference could be investigated.
3- It would be useful to train teachers on the use of the 5Es model in an effective way in the
EFL context
5.6 Suggestions for Future Research
This study is limited to the first level students at Taif University. Thus, it is difficult to generalize
the results. Future research needs to explore the 5Es model and practice teaching using the model
in all universities at Saudi Arabia. A larger sample size would make the findings more
generalizable. Also, it would be worthwhile to design a test and a program focusing on a particular
language skill rather than the whole language to enhance the improvement of this skill.
