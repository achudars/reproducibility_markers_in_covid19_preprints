DYNAMICS OF JAPAN’S INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS:
CAUSALITY, LONG-RUN TREND AND IMPLICATION
Abstract
While CO2 emissions from the residential and commercial sectors of Japan have increased
significantly since 1990 the country‟s industrial emissions make up the largest share of those
emissions. The historical CO2 emission performance data also indicate that the iron and steel,
chemical, paper and pulp and cement were the top four largest industrial emitters, and these
top four emitting industries contributed nearly two-third of the industrial sector‟s total CO2
emission amount during 1990-2015. Evidently, any appropriate efforts or strategies guided by
an empirical investigation like this are expected to help Japan‟s industrial emitters move
toward a more tolerable and less polluted carbon footprint, which is well-matched with the
country‟s commitment to Kyoto Protocol. This study is thus an effort to empirically
investigate the causality and long-run trend/relationship between Japan‟s industrial
production and CO2 emissions and to propose some corporate environmental strategies using
the econometric techniques of Vector Error Correction (VEC) and Granger causality. It found
that there exists no Granger causality between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2
emissions in any direction. But the VEC estimation reveals that an increase in Japan‟s
industrial production by 1% is associated with a 0.08% increase in the country‟s CO2
emissions. It also reveals that any disequilibrium between Japan‟s industrial production and
CO2 emissions could take about 0.7 quarters for half of the error to be corrected for. The
adjustment rate for Japan‟s industrial production is found to be positive but quite slow at the
rate of 0.08% per year. Since Japan‟s CO2 emissions vis-à-vis its industrial production is
found to have reached above the long-run equilibrium level, its industrial sector is expected
to encounter with stricter government regulations requiring reduction of CO2 emissions to the
targeted/equilibrium level in the future.

INTRODUCTION
It is apparent that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions arising from industrialised and
industrialising countries‟ industrial processes are substantial. The industrial processes
combine input and raw materials to produce goods and services, which result in large
amounts of CO2 emissions. Evidence suggests that nearly a third of the world‟s energy
consumption and 36% CO2 emissions are attributable to manufacturing industries
(International Energy Agency, 2007). The bulk of these CO2 emissions are related to the large
primary materials industries, such as chemicals and petrochemicals, iron and steel, cement,
pulp and paper, and aluminium. Even though over the last decade global industrial energy
efficiency has improved and CO2 emission has declined substantially in many sectors, this
progress has been more than offset by growing industrial production worldwide.
Consequently, total industrial energy consumption and CO2 emissions have continued to rise.
Scientists predict that over the next 40 years, demand for industrial materials in most sectors
is expected to double or triple. Therefore, CO2 emission reductions are vital across the whole
of industry, but action is particularly crucial in the five most energy-intensive sectors, namely
iron and steel, cement, chemicals and petrochemicals, pulp and paper, and aluminium.

Therefore, these industrial sectors in any country need to play a greater role to reduce CO2
emissions in the country.
Some studies have analysed the relationship between industrial/manufacturing
production and CO2 emissions for various countries/regions including the United States,
European Union, Great Britain, Korea, and Taiwan. All these studies have revealed the fact,
among others, that industrial/manufacturing activities result in significant volumes of CO2
emissions. In fact, manufacturing and industrial processes all combine to produce large
amounts of each type of greenhouse gas but specifically large amounts of CO2 because of the
following two reasons: first, many manufacturing facilities directly use fossil fuels to create
heat and steam needed at various stages of production and second, their energy intensive
activities use more electricity than any other sector so unless they are using renewable
sources the energy that they use is responsible for vast amounts of emissions (United States
Department of Energy 2005, 2002). Since the industrial/manufacturing sectors have
apparently been proven as the significant contributors to the CO2 emissions, they reasonably
have substantial potential in reducing the same. A study by International Energy Agency
reveals that the industrial CO2 emissions reduction potential amounts to 1.9 to 3.2 gigatonnes
per year, about seven to 12% of today‟s global CO2 emissions (International Energy Agency,
2007).
Also a very recent study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
reveals that the largest source of CO2 emissions globally is the combustion of fossil fuels
such as coal, oil and gas in power plants, automobiles, industrial facilities and other sources
(United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). This study further reveals that a
number of specialised industrial production processes and product uses such as mineral
production, metal production and the use of petroleum-based products can also lead to CO2
emissions. Studies on the European Union and the Great Britain also reveal similar findings.
Referring to Britain, a study by the Committee on Climate Change stated that as the economy
and industrial production return from recession to growth, CO2 emissions will rise again
(Committee on Climate Change, 2010). The study on European Union reveals that global
downturn is forcing industrial installations to cut back on production and therefore on their
CO2 emissions (Singh, 2007).
The empirical findings from some studies on Asian countries are also found to have
matched with those obtained on the United States, European Union, and Great Britain. For
example, the rate of growth of industrial CO2 emissions has drastically decreased since the
1998 financial crisis in Korea (Lim et al., 2009). This study further reveals that of all the
individual factors, economic growth accounted for the largest increase in CO2 emissions in
Korea. The empirical results of a similar study conducted on Taiwan indicate that industrial
production has the closest relationship with aggregate CO2 emission changes (Chang & Lin,
1999). Also the empirical results obtained by another study on Taiwan indicate that the
primary factor for the increase of CO2 emission is the level of domestic final demand and
exports (Chang & Lin, 1998). Moreover, some recent studies have studied the link between
firms‟ CO2 emission strategy and their performance in a comprehensive way. The results of
one of those studies conducted by Lee (2012) indicated a significant relationship between a
firms‟ carbon strategy and its sector and size. But a significant relationship between the
carbon strategy and firm performance was not confirmed by that study. Another study by
Sariannidis et al. (2013) revealed that a firm's financial performance is closely related to its
environmental behaviour. The empirical findings of the study have also revealed that the

performance of socially responsible firms is negatively related to an increase of global CO2
emissions. That means firms‟ commitment to do corporate social responsibility does help
decrease global CO2 emissions. In fact, many firms are facing increasing pressure by
governments, shareholders and other stakeholders to reduce their CO2 emissions in order to
mitigate climate change. The importance of managing CO2 emissions and crafting adequate
CO2 strategies has increased for those firms affected (Weinhofer & Hoffmann, 2010). This
study found that firms with different CO2 emissions reduction strategies significantly differ in
terms of company size and absolute amount of CO2 emissions they contribute.
Furthermore, the study by Alvarez (2012) found an interesting finding revealing that
CO2 emission variation is a significant but negative variable for firm‟s rate on asset (ROA).
This study, on the other hand, also revealed that CO2 emission variation is insignificant but
positive variable for rate on equity (ROE). A similar but very recent study conducted by Fujii
et al. (2013) at Japanese context added further to the literature. The study argued that
environmental performance increases ROA through both returns on sales and improved
capital turnover and that there exists a significant positive relationship between financial
performance and environmental performance based on CO2 emissions. The authors of the
Japanese study also argued that these findings may provide evidence for the consequences of
firms' environmental behaviour and sustainable development. Another study by Boiral et al.
(2012) argued that there is win–win relationship between the commitment to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and financial performance. But an earlier study by Sprengel and
Busch (2011) found that firms' response strategies do not actually relate to individual
stakeholder groups, but rather the firms‟ level of pollution measured as its greenhouse gas
intensity is identified to have an influence on the environmental strategy. Nevertheless,
stakeholders‟ influences on and their close associations with firms are still important for
firms to get motivation to undertake sound environmental strategies will help reduce CO2
emissions from their productions and operations. In fact, the firms that are close-toconsumers are more likely to undertake environmental activities for which there was no
explicit cost-reduction benefit, suggesting that reputation with consumers/society may be a
particular business motivator for them (Haddock-Fraser & Tourelle, 2010).
As the world‟s third-largest national economy as well as the world‟s second-largest
developed economy, Japan is the world‟s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which
comprise of about 95% CO2 emissions in the country (Huang & Nagasaka, 2011). This is
likely to continue to grow in the future (Ministry of the Environment, 2011; Ogawa, 2008).
Since CO2 gas was dominant, most of the reduction policy or activity was targeting on CO 2
emission reduction (Huang & Nagasaka, 2011). Japan‟s CO2 emissions have increased by
11.3% since 1990 and there was a gap of 12.2% in 2006 compared to the country's emission
reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol (Ministry of the Environment, 2008). It is worth
noting to mention that under the Kyoto Protocol Japan has made a commitment for a 6%
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the base year of 1990. This means that
not enough efforts by the Japan‟s Ministry of Environment have been taken to meet its
emission reduction target. While CO2 emissions from the residential and commercial sectors
have increased significantly since 1990 the country‟s industrial emissions account for the
largest share, which is 36% of total emissions (Kiko Network, 2008). The historical CO2
emission performance data also indicate that the Iron and Steel, Chemical, Paper and Pulp
and Cement were the top four largest emitters in Japan‟s industrial sector, and these top four
emitting industries contributed nearly 62% of the industrial sector‟s total CO2 emission
amount during 1990-2008 (Ministry of the Environment, 2011; Ogawa, 2008). Evidently, any

effort or policy guided by an empirical investigation like this will help Japan to move toward
a more tolerable and less polluted carbon footprint, which is well-matched with the country‟s
commitment to Kyoto Protocol.
This study is thus an effort to empirically investigate causality and long-run trend
between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions. It also discusses the implications
of the empirical results for the country‟s industrial sector and suggests some appropriate
corporate environmental strategies that are expected to help move the trend between CO2
emissions and industrial production towards the long-run equilibrium.
DATA AND METHOD
Keeping the research objective in mind, this study has gathered relevant time series data and
information from several secondary sources. The data for two time series variables covering
the period 1990-2015 were collected from the United Nations online database (UNdata,
2016). The variable of Japan‟s CO2 emissions (Thousands metric tonnes) was coded as
JPCO2 while Japan‟s industrial production index was coded as JPIP. Both series of variables
were tested for stationarity or non-stationarity using the widely used augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests for a unit root. The unit root tests on time series
variables were conducted in order to determine whether data are suitable for advanced
econometric analysis and to defend the econometric models against the characteristics of
spurious time series regressions.
A Vector Error Correction (VEC) estimation of the paired time series was conducted
in order to observe the long-run adjustment coefficients on cointregrated equation of the
model. Since VEC model is a special type of restricted Vector Autoregression (VAR), which
is an econometric model used to capture the evolution and the interdependencies between
multiple time series, the unrestricted cointegration test and VEC Pairwise Granger Causality
test were also reasonably conducted for the model. Other features of the combined model
such as inverse roots of Autoregressive (AR) characteristics polynomial were checked and
VEC lag exclusion Wald test, VEC residual serial correlation LM test, VEC residual
normality test, VEC residual heteroskedasticity test, and impulse responses of the variables to
Cholesky test were also conducted.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Unit Root Test
In the ADF test an automatic lag length of 7 using a Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) was
used. The lag length criterion is used to ensure that there is no autocorrelation in the ADF
regression residuals. Hence choosing the minimum lag length is necessary for the ADF
regression to avoid an autocorrelation problem in residuals. For example, an ADF test result
value of -4.50 and a lag length of 5 is not interpreted differently from an ADF test result of 3.50 and a lag length of 0. This is to say that lag length in the ADF test does not affect the
ultimate result. So in this study, choosing an automatic leg length of 7 does actually not have
an impact on the strength of the ADF model as well as the findings. Most importantly, 7 lag
lengths were actually chosen automatically by the ADF test based on some criteria. The ADF
test results have been summarized in Table 1.

We have then conducted PP test on LJPCO2 and LJPIP at their first order [I(1)], but
the result was supporting the trend of stationary in both series (Table 2). Having found both
the series as statistically significant we can reject the null hypothesis, which confirms their
stationary nature at I(1).

Since the above two prominent unit root tests clearly reveal that both time series
variables are non-stationary at I(0) and stationary at I(1), our conclusion on the nature of data
and their suitability to use to develop the appropriate time-series econometric models can be
taken with confidence. The presence of a unit root in both the series at their I(0) and its
absence at their I(1) suggest that we need to adopt a more sophisticated econometric model to
analyse their long-run relationship. Since VECM is widely used for explaining the long-run
relationships between or among time series variables we have developed the model to attain
the objective of this study.

VECM Estimation
A vector error correction model (VECM) is a special type of restricted Vector Autoregression
(VAR). For that reason, the general equation of a VECM with two dependent variables
{hence, (logJPCO2) and (logJPIP)} using the best „Lag Interval for Endogenous,‟ option of
„1 3‟ can be presented in the following form:
G

D(Yg ,t )  A( g ,1) * Co int   C ( g ,3k  1) * D(Yg ,t 1 )
k 1

G

G

  C ( g ,3k  2) * D(Yg ,t 2 )   C ( g ,3k ) D(Yg ,t 3 ) C ( g ,3G  1)   g ,t
k 1

k 1

th

In the above equation, Yg,t is the g endogenous variable at the time t, for g = 1, 2, …, G.
The estimated results based on the above VECM of logJPCO2 and logJPIP with lag
specification „1 3‟ reveal that the cointegrating equation has a significant effect on each of the
endogenous variables. With a coefficient value of 0.08 for logJPIP(t-1) in the cointegrating
vector the critical value for t with 12 degrees of freedom is -4.8 {(0.08-1.0)/0.19}, which is
statistically significant (P<0.01). Using the above VECM we have actually estimated the
changes in Japan‟s industrial production on Japan‟s CO2 emissions and the changes in
Japan‟s CO2 emissions on Japan industrial production. The cointegrating system within the
VECM includes the variables of Japan‟s CO2 emissions and Japan‟s industrial production.
Outside the cointegrating system, variables include differences in lags of all endogenous
variables to the first, second and third orders. The cointegrating vectors represent the
coefficients of the linear combination of nonstationary variables, which are now stationary in
nature. The estimated cointegrating equation is presented below:
log JPCO 2 ( t 1)  14.40  0.08 log JPIP( t 1)
[ 0.42]

We begin with by examining the coefficient estimates within the cointegrating
relationship. The above equation presents the estimated cointegrating vectors with
normalisation on the variable of the log Japan‟s CO2 emissions. Since we intend to know the
movements of Japan‟s CO2 emissions to Japan‟s industrial production, normalising on the log
Japan‟s CO2 emissions will serve this purpose. The only cointegrating coefficient estimate for
log Japan‟s industrial production suggests the degrees of influence that Japan‟s industrial
production can have on the country‟s CO2 emissions in the long-run. The estimated
coefficient for Japan‟s industrial production is 0.08, which is also considered as the elasticity
of coefficient. Assuming all other factors remain constant, an increase in Japan‟s industrial
production by 1% is associated with a 0.08% increase in the country‟s CO2 emissions. This
suggests that Japan‟s industrial production and the related policy have considerable effects on
the country‟s CO2 emissions. However, the estimation of VEC models with the two
dependent variables can be presented as:

D(log JPCO 2 )   0.99(log JPCO 2 t 1  0.08 log JPIPt 1  14.40)

The adjustment coefficient on CointEq1 for Japan‟s CO2 emissions is negative as it
should be. The estimated speed of adjustment to disequilibrium is -0.99 and it indicates how
fast the equilibrium is restored. A coefficient of -0.99 means that a change of 1% caused by
lagged changes in the other variable rises to a change of 1.99% because of adjustment to
equilibrium. Taking half-life formula of Q=ln2/β, which was developed by Haeussler & Paul
(1996), this in fact suggests fast adjustment as it would take only 0.7 quarters for half of the
error to be corrected for. On the other hand, the adjustment coefficient in the same equation
for Japan‟s industrial production is positive as it should be and is quite slow at the rate of
0.08% a year. Therefore, most of the adjustment is being done by Japan‟s CO2 emissions.
The results also reveal that two lagged variables of Japan‟s industrial production D(logJPIP(t1)) and D(logJPIP(t-3)) are both statistically significant in the Japan‟s CO2 emissions equation
at the probability value of 0.025, but D(logJPIP(t-2)) was found to be statistically insignificant
in the same equation. Furthermore, all three lagged variables of Japan CO2 emissions are
statistically insignificant in the Japan industrial production equation. The results also reveal
that the regressions with the dependent variables of D(logJPCO2) and D(logJPIP) have
positive R-squared values (0.82 and 0.32 respectively), which indicate that 82% of the
variation in D(logJPCO2) and 32% of the variation in D(logJPIP) could be explained by the
above VEC models. F-statistic supports the models are well specified.
The cointegration tests for the above VEC models were also conducted in order to
justify the applicability of the model in the real world situation. In fact, there are two tests,
the Trace statistic, which is more reliable and the Max-Eigenvalue statistic. The results show
that there is one cointegrating equation at the 0.05 level based on the Trace test and that the
Max-Eigenvalue test indicates one cointegrating equation at both 0.01 and 0.05 levels. So
based on these findings, the VECM of (logJPCO2) and (logJPIP) should be considered as a
highly acceptable model.
The above VEC models also reveals that when Japan‟s CO2 emission levels deviate
from the long-run equilibrium, the error correction will be triggered automatically. As a result
the speed of adjustment is expected to have a negative sign. For example, whenever Japan‟s
CO2 emissions move higher than the equilibrium level the CO2 emissions will soon start
correcting itself by lowering the emission levels.
Causality test

In our effort to check other characteristics of the above models, the VEC Pairwise Granger
Causality test was also conducted. The results reveal that there is no bidirectional causal
relationship between Japan industrial production and the country‟s CO2 emissions. Since the
null hypothesis is that the coefficients are zero, there is clearly no Granger causality between
the variables. The inverse roots graph of the lag polynomial was also generated in order to
check the model stability. Figure 1 below shows that one of the eight roots lies on the unit
cycle corresponding to the stochastic trend while the all other roots lie inside. Since no root
lies outside the unit circle the model appears to be stable.

Model Diagnostic Test
The VEC Lag Exclusion Wald Tests were also conducted and the results reveal that the joint
effects of the first, second, and third differentiated lags of Japan‟s CO2 emissions and the
country‟s industrial production are statistically significant (P<0.05). The VEC Residual Serial
Correlation LM Tests were also conducted to check the serial correlation problem in the
model. With the null hypothesis that there is no serial correlation at lag order h(=12),
however the probability values from Chi-square at all 12 lags are not statistically significant
(P>0.05). This is clearly an evidence of no serial correlation problem in the model. Then
VEC Residual Normality Tests were also conducted to check the multivariate normality of
the residuals. With the null hypothesis that residuals are multivariate normal, Jarque-Bera
statistic of 7.79 for the joint component is found to have been statistically insignificant
(P>0.05). That means the model residuals are clearly multivariate normal. Finally, the
impulse response combined graphs with Cholesky – degrees of freedom adjusted were
generated in order to check the effect on the system of shocks to each variable. Figure 2
provides a graphical view of the Cholesky (One S.D. Innovations) impulse response function
using the estimated VEC models. It actually provides the dynamic responses of the Japan‟s
CO2 emissions and the country‟s industrial production to a shock in the equilibrium.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
This study is an attempt to investigate the causality and long run trend between Japan‟s
industrial production and CO2 emissions and to discuss their implications for the country‟s
industrial sector, using time series data over the period 1990 to 2015. The results obtained
from the cointegration equation reveal that when Japan‟s industrial production increases by
1%, the CO2 emissions in the country increases by 0.08%. We understand that an increase in
Japan‟s industrial production by 1% per se does not contribute to the increase by 0.08% in the
country‟s CO2 emissions, but there are more business and economic activities that also
contribute to this increase in the emissions. Since both variables are proven to have been
positively co-integrated in the long-run we can just confirm their important relationship. Also
the results obtained from the VEC models reveal that any disequilibrium between Japan‟s
CO2 emissions and industrial production could take only 0.7 quarters for half of the error to
be corrected for. We also understand that any equilibrium or disequilibrium between the
variables must be explained with caution as mentioned earlier that not only the industrial
production activities cause CO2 emissions in the country. That being the case, any
convergence to the long-run equilibrium will be shorter due to CO2 emissions reduction

responses from other economic sectors. Hence the government‟s carbon tax policies or
emissions trading schemes and other regulations could also make the convergence time
considerably shorter.
Also, the VEC models reveal that the adjustment rate for the Japan industrial
production is positive as it should be, but it is quite slow at the rate of 0.08% a year. So in the
long-run, any disequilibrium will be corrected mostly by Japan‟s CO2 emissions. This implies
huge potential for Japan‟s CO2 emissions reduction strategies and policies to the country‟s
competitive industrial sector. The long-run disequilibrium between Japan‟s industrial
production and CO2 emissions implies that there must be taken some appropriate carbon
strategies by the government and actions by the industrial sectors to implement those carbon
strategies in order to achieve any targeted level of CO2 emissions. These carbon reduction
strategies may consider promoting alternative energy technologies and introducing fiscal
incentives to the actors in various industrial sectors. In particular, government may promote
alternative energy technologies that enable use of less carbon such as energy efficiency
improvements and energy conservation. Government‟s fiscal incentive strategies may
consider providing incentives to the industrial actors for fuel switching, CO2 re-using, carbon
capturing and storage, as all of these strategies could result in less CO2 emissions caused by
the country‟s industrial activities. While these strategies are already in implementation, for
instance, some flexible approaches by the government to motivate the industrial actors in
order to generate less CO2 emissions should also be in place. Depending on the type of
industrial sector, however, market-based incentives or permits; governmental loan
guarantees; investment tax credits; performance standards; tax reform; incentives for
technology; research, development and deployment; and other appropriate policy tools are
also proven to be the highly effective tools to reduce CO2 emissions, especially in the
industrialised countries. Since implementation of any sorts of corporate CO2 reduction
strategies pose significant challenges to firms that produce large volumes of CO2 emissions,
adaptable business strategies offer a potential solution to these perceived concerns and
problems (Martin and Rice, 2010). But in reality, if reduction of CO2 emissions to a targeted
level is the goal, a mix of regulatory and market-based government strategies is necessary for
any industrialised countries including Japan.
Finally, as confirmed by the VEC estimations, with regards to Japan‟s industrial
production the present CO2 emissions in the country are above the equilibrium level. This is
considered as an alarming situation for the country as its industrial sector, which is the most
emitter of carbon, will be embracing stricter regulations requiring considerable amount of
reduction in CO2 emissions in the future. Consequently, at the first case in point, it can be
concluded that Japan‟s industrial production could have significant effects on the country‟s
level of CO2 emissions. But contrary to this finding is the Granger causality test result, which
reveals the fact that neither Japan‟s industrial production is a Granger causal for its CO2
emissions nor its CO2 emissions are a Granger causal for its industrial production. It is thus
worth mentioning that having observed a cointegrating relation between two variables does
not necessarily mean they are causal one to other. This is because two or more time series
variables could be found as cointegrated if they share a common stochastic drift, which can
be described as the change of the average value of a stochastic (random) process. That being
the case, the crucial conclusion of this study should actually be based on the findings
obtained from the VEC estimations. While the nexus between CO2 emissions and industrial
production is being debated widely, a solid and universal conclusion on whether they are
actually causal and if yes, what actually causes what and why and how they are mutually

causal require a more in-depth investigation using a multidisciplinary approach at the levels
where the relevant stakeholders practically encounter with both the phenomena.
