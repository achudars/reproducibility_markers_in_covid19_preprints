The Factors of Selecting Malaysia as Tourist Destination
Abstract:
Tourism is an emerging economic sector for Malaysia. The purpose of this study is an attempt
to understand the factors that attract tourists to visit Malaysia. The primary data were
collected through questionnaire survey on 735 tourists who visited the state of Melaka,
Malaysia. This study used descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural
equation modelling (SEM) in order to analyze and draw the inferences. Model fit was initially
tested using the overall fit and regression paths. Then the hypothesized model was analysed
and modified based on the results of the analysis to find a better fit of the data and to more
adequately describe the relationships between the factors. The study found that several
economic, environmental, cultural and community factors have positive significant influence
in attracting tourists to Melaka.
Key Words: Sustainable tourism; structural equation modelling (SEM); Malaysia

Introduction
Tourism refers to travelling to relatively uninterrupted or uncontaminated natural areas with
focus on learning, appreciating and enjoying the scenery and its wild flora and fauna, as well
as other existing cultural and historical aspects. These include places of archaeological and
historical importance, religious sites, sanctuaries, parks, hill resorts and clubs and sea
beaches, and many others. This is a multi-sector industry consisting of a collection of
activities, services and industries that delivers travel experience, as well as transportation,
accommodation, eating and drinking businesses, retail shops, entertainment businesses,
activities, facilities and other hospitality services offered for individuals or groups travelling
away from home (Bhargava, 2009).
As a development strategy, the tourism sector has achieved significant earnings and
provided substantial contribution to the local and national economy for many countries. It is
also identified as one of the largest and fastest growing industries (Miller, 1990; Hunter,
1995; McMinn, 1997). For some developed or developing countries, the tourism industry
forms a critical component of the local, regional and national economy, contributing
significantly to employment opportunities, GDP growth and foreign exchange earnings. Not
merely for developing countries, tourism has turned out to be one of the very important
sources of earnings for the developed countries where it has already created substantial
foundation for tourism based economy, for example in countries like Singapore, Maldives
and Malaysia of which the total contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP in 2011 is 8.2%,
70.5%, 15% respectively.
In the case of Malaysia, tourism is the fifth leading industry after Oil, Gas and
Energy, Financial Services, Wholesale and Retail, and Palm oil (Jabatan Perdana Menteri,
2010). Today, the tourism industry of Malaysia has moved with such rapidity to become the
second income generator to the national economy whilst experiencing tremendous growth
year by year. The total contribution of travel and tourism to GDP was 15.8% in 2013 (WTTC
2013). Even though the tourism industry is a latecomer in Malaysia compared to its
neighbouring countries, namely Thailand and Singapore, it has recorded a successful
performance in terms of tourist arrivals and receipts (Tourism Malaysia, 2011). For example,
in 2010, Malaysia recorded 24.5 million tourist arrivals and RM55.6 billion in tourist receipts
compared to 5.5 million tourist arrivals and RM8.5 billion in tourist receipts in 1998 (Mintel,
2011). Globally, Malaysia ranked 9th out of the ten top most visited countries in terms of
2

international tourist arrivals in 2009 and 2010, achieving figures of 23.6 and 24.6 million
tourist arrivals respectively (United Nation, 2007; World Tourism Organization, 2011).
Lying just north of the equator, Malaysia is located south of Cambodia and Vietnam
and north of Singapore and Indonesia. More than one thousand islands are part of Malaysia
with some 38 designated as marine parks. Parts of the primeval rainforest are more than 100
million years old with a dazzling selection of birds and wildlife. Malaysia has wonderful
golden beaches, lush vegetation, mountains, and fabulous shopping centres which are
associated with some magnificent hotels. This has made the country the fastest growing
destination in South East Asia. The mix of the ancient and the ultra-modern makes Malaysia
a fascinating place to visit, while the low cost of living and huge selection of choices for
visitors make it an ideal holiday location. Malaysia experiences tropical climate throughout
the year, enjoying warm days and mild evenings in all seasons. The country also offers a
fascinating cultural mix with colourful festivals, unique arts and crafts, architecture, food and
a rich array of dance forms. It is ideally placed to take advantage of its increased interest in
the tourism industry, especially the ecotourism segment, as it possesses a wide variety of
natural land and marine habitats. Therefore, the long term prospects of Malaysian tourism
remain optimistic as a result of a strong government support and a relatively strong and stable
political situation (Malaysia Tourism Report, 2010).
Admittedly, according to Bhuiyan et al. (2013), foreign tourists’ arrival and tourist
expenditure on the basis of per capita and per diem is increasing year by year in Malaysia.
Malaysia has targeted to capture a place within the top 10 countries in the world in terms of
international tourist arrivals through various development plans. In this regard, less
developed countries (LDCs) consider tourism as an important tool for their economic
development (Taleghani, 2010).
It is to be hoped that every nation makes some effort to conserve and maintain their
cultural resources. In Malaysia, although a special law to protect and preserve historic
premises has been in existence since 1957 (Abdul Rahman, 1986), the subject of cultural
conservation has become a focus for public concern only over the past few years.
In the tourism industry, achieving competitive advantage refers to the notion where a
destination must have an overall “appeal” and where the tourist experience offered is superior
to that of the alternative destinations competing for the same target tourists (Dwyer and Kim,
2003). This study, therefore, is an attempt to understand the factors that attract tourists to visit
Malaysia and consider it as a tourist destination.
Data and Methodology
The study used primary data that were collected from Melaka State of Malaysia. Melaka was
selected because it is one of the top-picked holiday getaways for its natural, cultural, and
historical heritage which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. Melaka has
improved their products in and about the state, namely the convenience of their transportation
hub i.e. by upgrading the central bus terminal (Melaka Central), the UNESCO Heritage
Zones, the revitalized Melaka River, the night zoo, in-house guides in the museum and many
other places of historical and cultural interests, as well as good local dining and comfortable
accommodation. Most of the tourist attractions are concentrated in its small city centre, which
encompasses Jonker Walk that houses Melaka's traditional Chinatown and exhibits Peranakan
architecture. Additionally, A Famosa Fort and St. Paul Hill are among the tourist attractions
3

located in the Bandar Hilir, which is the old city area. There are also many shopping centres
located nearby, including the Melaka Straits Mosque which is also located in this area. There
are also numerous islands near Melaka including Pulau Upeh near Klebang Beach and Pulau
Besar. According to Tourism Malaysia (2011), a total of 12.35 million tourists had arrived in
Melaka in 2011.
Sustainability has become an important topic and concept in relation to tourism
planning and development (Inskeep, 1991; Southgate & Sharpley, 2002; Yuksel et. al., 1999).
To determine the sustainability of tourism, the economic, environmental, cultural and
community aspects were considered in this study. To attract tourists, the local economic
factors like currency exchange facility, shopping facility, overall economic condition of the
locality and many other related factors are important. Among the environmental factors,
aspects such as good management, landscaping, proper sanitation, sustainability of
ecosystems and several other factors were the focus of this study. In terms of the cultural
perspective of tourism, the diversity of traditions and culture, tourism activities, existing
tradition and culture, handicrafts market, racial diversity, different cuisines and many other
related factors were considered. Finally, the factors of community-inspired support of tourism
like infrastructure, convenience of communication, informative community, high speed
internet facility, and development of local community and a few other factors were those
considered for the measurement of sustainable tourism.
The data of the study were collected from a questionnaire survey on 735 tourists. The
non-probability convenience sampling technique was used for selecting samples. The survey
was carried out from October to November 2013.

This study used descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural
equation modelling (SEM) to analyze and draw the inferences. The SEM model was tested by
using AMOS. Model fit was initially tested using the overall fit and regression paths. Then
the hypothesized model was analysed and modified based on the results of the analysis to
find a better fit of the data and to more adequately describe the relationships between the
factors.

Structural Equation Model (SEM)
The SEM model was used to examine the hypothesized relationships between the constructs
(factors) in the model (Figure 2). The findings of the study indicate that there are positive
significant relationship between sustainable tourism and its economic, environmental,
cultural and community factors. Among the latent variables, the Structural Equation model
5

shows that the environmental construct has the highest influence (0.92) on sustainable
tourism compared to cultural (0.85), economic (0.81), and community (0.80) constructs.

Figure 2 Structural Equation Model diagram for measuring sustainable tourism in Melaka
Convergent validity test results included variance estimates between factors and
variable loadings on factors for each variable (Table 2). Among the economic latent
variables, the path coefficient of overall economic condition of the locality (DA6) obtained
the highest value (0.78), followed by tourist shopping facility (DA4), and money exchange
facility (DA3).
Among several latent variables of environment factors, well maintained heritage
(DB1) obtained the highest path coefficient, followed by environmental quality (DB3), well
protected heritage (DB4), Melaka’s landscape (DB2), sanitation quality (DB5), seasonality
(DB6) and sustainability of ecosystems (DB7) (Table 2). The path coefficient of tourism
activities (DC3) and handicrafts market (DC6) attained the highest position among the
cultural latent variables, followed by racial diversity (DC7), diversity in tradition and culture
(DC5), traditions and cultures (DC1), scope of learning (DC9), meeting opportunities with
6

the community (DC10), food diversity (DC11), multi-ethnic society (DC8), and friendly
community (DC2) (Table 2).

To determine the model’s goodness of fit, several types of indicators and conditions were
tested and these are given in Table 7. The Chi-square value is significant at 1% level (p<
0.00) which is 3.26 with 282 degree of freedom = 918.42. The goodness of fit index (GFI)
and the normed fit index (NFI) are above 0.90, indicating a good fit (Bentler & Bonett, 1990).
The model has a GFI of 0.91 and a NFI of 0.92, which show a good fit model. The adjusted
9

goodness of fit (AGFI) is 0.89, which is a little bit less than the acceptable good fit. However,
the comparative fit index (CFI) which is 0.95 represents a reasonable model fit (Sim et al.,
2006). The root-mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) shows the proportion of the
variance of the model is 0.05, indicating a reasonable model fit (Sim et al., 2006). Overall,
the GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, CFI, and RMSR tests confirm the reliability of this path
measurement model.

Cronbach’s alpha is used to determine the reliability of multi-item factors. The latent
variables in this model have high Cronbach's Alpha values which are at 0.795, 0.886, 0.927
and 0.872 for economy, environment, culture, and community, respectively. Therefore, the
reliability level for attitudes towards economy, environment, culture and community all meet
the critical value of 0.7 as suggested by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994).
The result of the estimation indicates that the critical ratio (C.R.) value for regression
between the economic latent variables and its three observed variables are out of range at
+1.96, which indicates all of the three variables are significant. Similar results were also
found for the environmental latent variables with its seven observed variables, the cultural
latent variables with its eleven observed variables, and the community latent variables with
its five observed variables.
Conclusion and Recommendation
Tourism is the second largest economic sector in Malaysia. Each year many tourists come
and visit the tourist destinations and attractions in Malaysia, and Melaka is one of the major
tourist destinations among the many tourist spots in Malaysia. This study found that several
factors from the economic, environmental, cultural and community constructs are important
in attracting tourists to Melaka.
Chi and Qu (2008) suggest that tourist satisfaction is considered a necessary goal for a
business because satisfied tourists will recommend the place to other people. Therefore, for
the improvement of the tourism sector in Malaysia, laws and policies related to tourists
should be established in Malaysia. At the same time, public and private sectors need to be
involved in developing long term urban planning and development planning. More
employment in the local communities needs to be established through development of new
10

tourist industries and restoration work such as development of ecotourism, nature tourism,
cultural tourism, service tourism and other potential tourism products. Accordingly, all the
necessary training and support should be given to the tour guides to make them more capable
of effectively guiding the international tourists coming to this country.
