The Valuation of Credit Default Swap with
Counterparty Risk and Collateralization

Tim Xiao1

ABSTRACT
This article presents a new model for valuing a credit default swap (CDS) contract that is affected
by multiple credit risks of the buyer, seller and reference entity. We show that default dependency has a
significant impact on asset pricing. In fact, correlated default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in
financial markets. We also show that a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one. In
other words, full collateralization cannot eliminate counterparty risk completely in the CDS market.

Key Words: valuation model; credit risk modeling; collateralization; correlation, CDS.

Introduction
There are two primary types of models that attempt to describe default processes in the literature:

structural models and reduced-form (or intensity) models. Many practitioners in the credit trading arena
have tended to gravitate toward the reduced-from models given their mathematical tractability.
Central to the reduced-form models is the assumption that multiple defaults are independent
conditional on the state of the economy. In reality, however, the default of one party might affect the
default probabilities of other parties. Collin-Dufresne et al. (2003) and Zhang and Jorion (2007) find that
a major credit event at one firm is associated with significant increases in the credit spreads of other
firms. Giesecke (2004), Das et al. (2006), and Lando and Nielsen (2010) find that a defaulting firm can
weaken the firms in its network of business links. These findings have important implications for the
management of credit risk portfolios, where default relationships need to be explicitly modeled.
The main drawback of the conditionally independent assumption or the reduced-form models is
that the range of default correlations that can be achieved is typically too low when compared with
empirical default correlations (see Das et al. (2007)). The responses to correct this weakness can be
generally classified into two categories: endogenous default relationship approaches and exogenous
default relationship approaches.
The endogenous approaches include the contagion (or infectious) models and frailty models. The
frailty models (see Duffie et al. (2009), Koopman et al. (2011), etc) describe default clustering based on
some unobservable explanatory variables. In variations of contagion or infectious type models (see Davis
and Lo (2001), Jarrow and Yu (2001), etc.), the assumption of conditional independence is relaxed and
default intensities are made to depend on default events of other entities. Contagion and frailty models fill
an important gap but at the cost of analytic tractability. They can be especially difficult to implement for
large portfolios.
The exogenous approaches (see Li (2000), Laurent and Gregory (2005), Hull and White (2004),
Brigo et al. (2011), etc) attempt to link marginal default probability distributions to the joint default

1

probability distribution through some external functions. Due to their simplicity in use, practitioners lean
toward the exogenous ones.
Given a default model, one can value a risky derivative contract and compute credit value
adjustment (CVA) that is a relatively new area of financial derivative modeling and trading. CVA is the
expected loss arising from the default of a counterparty (see Brigo and Capponi (2008), Lipton and Sepp
(2009), Pykhtin and Zhu (2006), Gregory (2009), Bielecki et al (2013) and Crepey (2015), Xiao (2015),
Xiao (2017), etc.)
Collateralization as one of the primary credit risk mitigation techniques becomes increasingly
important and widespread in derivatives transactions. According the ISDA (2013), 73.7% of all OTC
derivatives trades (cleared ad non-cleared) are subject to collateral agreements. For large firms, the figure
is 80.7%. On an asset class basis, 83.0% of all CDS transactions and 79.2% of all fixed income
transactions are collateralized. For large firms, the figures are 96.3% and 89.4%, respectively. Previous
studies on collateralization include Johannes and Sundaresan (2007), Fuijii and Takahahsi (2012),
Piterbarg (2010), Bielecki, et al (2013) and Hull and White (2014), etc.
This paper presents a new framework for valuing defaultable financial contracts with or without
collateral arrangements. The framework characterizes default dependencies exogenously, and models
collateral processes directly based on the fundamental principals of collateral agreements. For brevity we
focus on CDS contracts, but many of the points we make are equally applicable to other derivatives. CDS
has trilateral credit risk, where three parties – buyer, seller and reference entity – are defaultable.
In general, a CDS contract is used to transfer the credit risk of a reference entity from one party to
another. The risk circularity that transfers one type of risk (reference credit risk) into another
(counterparty credit risk) within the CDS market is a concern for financial stability. Some people claim
that the CDS market has increased financial contagion or even propose an outright ban on these
instruments.
The standard CDS pricing model in the market assumes that there is no counterparty risk.
Although this oversimplified model may be accepted in normal market conditions, its reliability in times
2

of distress has recently been questioned. In fact, counterparty risk has become one of the most dangerous
threats to the CDS market. For some time now it has been realized that, in order to value a CDS properly,
counterparty effects have to be taken into account (see ECB (2009)).
We bring the concept of comvariance into the area of credit risk modeling to capture the
statistical relationship among three or more random variables. Comvariance was first introduced to
economics by Deardorff (1982), who used this measurement to correlate three factors in international
trading. Furthermore, we define a new statistics, comrelation, as a scaled version of comvariance.
Accounting for default correlations and comrelations becomes important in determining CDS premia,
especially during the credit crisis. Our analysis shows that the effect of default dependencies on a CDS
premium from large to small accordingly is i) the default correlation between the protection seller and the
reference entity, ii) the default comrelation, iii) the default correlation between the protection buyer and
the reference entity, and iv) the default correlation between the protection buyer and the protection seller.
In particular, we find that the default comvariance/comrelation has substantial effects on the asset pricing
and risk management, which have never been documented.
There is a significant increase in the use of collateral for CDS after the recent financial crises.
Many people believe that, if a CDS is fully collateralized, there is no risk of failure to pay. Collateral
posting regimes are originally designed and utilized for bilateral risk products, e.g., interest rate swap
(IRS), but there are many reasons to be concerned about the success of collateral posting in offsetting the
risk of CDS contracts. First, the value of CDS contracts tends to move very suddenly with big jumps,
whereas the price movements of IRS contracts are far smoother and less volatile than CDS prices. Second,
CDS spreads can widen very rapidly. Third, CDS contracts have many more risk factors than IRS
contracts. In fact, our model shows that full collateralization cannot eliminate counterparty risk
completely for a CDS contract.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Pricing multilateral defaultable financial contract is
elaborated on in Section 2; numerical results are provided in Section 3; the conclusions are presented in
Section 4. All proofs and some detailed derivations are contained in the appendices.

Pricing Financial Contracts Subject to Multiple Credit Risks
We consider a filtered probability space (  , F , Ft t 0 , P ) satisfying the usual conditions,

where  denotes a sample space, F denotes a  -algebra, P denotes a probability measure, and

Ft t 0 denotes a filtration.
In the reduced-form approach, the stopping (or default) time  i of firm i is modeled as a Cox
arrival process (also known as a doubly stochastic Poisson process) whose first jump occurs at default and
is defined by,



t

 i = inf t :  hi ( s, Z s )ds  H i
0



(1)

where hi (t ) or hi (t , Z t ) denotes the stochastic hazard rate or arrival intensity dependent on an exogenous
common state Z t , and H i is a unit exponential random variable independent of Z t .
It is well-known that the survival probability from time t to s in this framework is defined by
s
pi (t , s) := Pi (  s |   t , Z t ) = exp −  hi (u )du 
 t


(2a)

The default probability for the period (t, s) in this framework is given by
s
qi (t , s) := Pi (  s |   t , Z t ) = 1 − pi (t , s) = 1 − exp −  hi (u )du 
 t


(2b)

There is ample evidence that corporate defaults are correlated. The default of a firm’s
counterparty might affect its own default probability. Thus, default correlation/dependence occurs due to
the counterparty relations.
The interest in the financial industry for the modeling and pricing of multilateral defaultable
instruments arises mainly in two respects: in the management of credit risk at a portfolio level and in the
valuation of credit derivatives. Central to the valuation and risk management of credit derivatives and
risky portfolios is the problem of default relationship.

Let us discuss a three-party case first. A CDS is a good example of a trilateral defaultable
instrument where the three parties are counterparties A, B and reference entity C. In a standard CDS
contract one party purchases credit protection from another party, to cover the loss of the face value of a
reference entity following a credit event. The protection buyer makes periodic payments to the seller until
the maturity date or until a credit event occurs. A credit event usually requires a final accrual payment by
the buyer and a loss protection payment by the protection seller. The protection payment is equal to the
difference between par and the price of the cheapest to deliver (CTD) asset of the reference entity on the
face value of the protection.
A CDS is normally used to transfer the credit risk of a reference entity between two
counterparties. The contract reduces the credit risk of the reference entity but gives rise to another form of
risk: counterparty risk. Since the dealers are highly concentrated within a small group, any of them may
be too big to fail. The interconnected nature, with dealers being tied to each other through chains of OTC
derivatives, results in increased contagion risk. Due to its concentration and interconnectedness, the CDS
market seems to pose a systemic risk to financial market stability. In fact, the CDS is blamed for playing a
pivotal role in the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the disintegration of AIG.
For years, a widespread practice in the market has been to mark CDS to market without taking the
counterparty risk into account. The realization that even the most prestigious investment banks could go
bankrupt has shattered the foundation of the practice. It is wiser to face frankly the real complexities of
pricing a CDS than to indulge in simplifications that have proved treacherous. For some time now it has
been realized that, in order to value a CDS properly, counterparty effects have to be taken into account.
Let A denote the protection buyer, B denote the protection seller and C denote the reference
entity. The binomial default rule considers only two possible states: default or survival. Therefore, the
default indicator Y j for firm j (j = A or B or C) follows a Bernoulli distribution, which takes value 1 with
default probability q j , and value 0 with survival probability p j . The marginal default distributions can be
determined by the reduced-form models. The joint distributions of a multivariate Bernoulli variable can

5

be easily obtained via the marginal distributions by introducing extra correlations. The joint probability
representations of a trivariate Bernoulli distribution (see Teugels (1990)) are given by
p 000 := P(Y A = 0, YB = 0, YC = 0) = p A p B pC + pC  AB + p B AC + p A BC −  ABC

(3a)

p100 := P(Y A = 1, YB = 0, YC = 0) = q A p B pC − pC  AB − p B AC + q A BC +  ABC

(3b)

p 010 := P(Y A = 0, YB = 1, YC = 0) = p A q B pC − pC  AB + q B AC − p A BC +  ABC

(3c)

p 001 := P(Y A = 0, YB = 0, YC = 1) = p A p B qC + qC  AB − p B AC − p A BC +  ABC

(3d)

p110 := P(Y A = 1, YB = 1, YC = 0) = q A q B pC + pC  AB − q B AC − q A BC −  ABC

(3e)

p101 := P(Y A = 1, YB = 0, YC = 1) = q A p B qC − qC  AB + p B AC − q A BC −  ABC

(3f)

p011 := P(Y A = 0, YB = 1, YC = 1) = p A q B qC − qC  AB − q B AC + p A BC −  ABC

(3g)

p111 := P(Y A = 1, YB = 1, YC = 1) = q A q B qC + qC  AB + q B AC + q A BC +  ABC

(3h)

where

 ABC := E(( YA − q A )( YB − q B )( YC − qC ))

(3i)

Equation (3) tells us that the joint probability distribution of three defaultable parties depends not
only on the bivariate statistical relationships of all pair-wise combinations (e.g.,  ij ) but also on the
trivariate statistical relationship (e.g.,  ABC ).  ABC was first defined by Deardorff (1982) as comvariance,
who use it to correlate three random variables that are the value of commodity net imports/exports, factor
intensity, and factor abundance in international trading.
We introduce the concept of comvariance into credit risk modeling arena to exploit any statistical
relationship among multiple random variables. Furthermore, we define a new statistic, comrelation, as a
scaled version of comvariance (just like correlation is a scaled version of covariance) as follows:
Definition 1: For three random variables X A , X B , and X C , let  A ,  B , and C denote the means of
X A , X B , and X C . The comrelation of X A , X B , and X C is defined by

E( X A −  A )( X B −  B )( X C −  C )

 ABC =
3

3

3

E X A −  A  E X B −  B  E X C − C

3

(4)

6

According to the Holder inequality, we have
E (( X A −  A )( X B −  B )( X C −  C ) )  E ( X A −  A )( X B −  B )( X C −  C )

(5)

 E X A −  A  E X B −  B  E X C − C
3

3

3

3

Obviously, the comrelation is in the range of [-1, 1]. Given the comrelation, Equation (3i) can be
rewritten as
 ABC := E ((YA − q A )(YB − qB )( X C − qC ) ) =  ABC 3 E YA − q A  E YB − qB  E YC − qC
3

3

=  ABC 3 p Aq A ( p A2 + q A2 ) pB qB ( pB2 + qB2 ) pC qC ( p C2 + qC2 )

3

(6)

3

where E (Y j ) = q j and E Y j − q j = p j q j ( p 2j + q 2j ) , j=A, B, or C.
If we have a series of n measurements of X A , X B , and X C written as x Ai , xBi and xCi where i =
1,2,…,n, the sample comrelation coefficient can be obtained as:

i =1 ( x Ai −  A )(xBi −  B )(xCi − C )
 ABC =

3
3
n
n
n
3
i =1 x Ai −  A  i =1 xBi −  B  i =1 xCi − C
n

(7)

More generally, we define the comrelation in the context of n random variables as
Definition 2: For n random variables X 1 , X 2 ,…, X n , let  i denote the mean of X i where i=1,..,n. The
comrelation of X 1 , X 2 ,…, X n is defined as
E( X 1 − 1 )( X 2 −  2 )    ( X n −  n )

 12...n =

Correlation is just a specific case of comrelation where n = 2. Again, the comrelation  12...n is in
the range of [-1, 1] according to the Holder inequality.
2.1

Risky valuation without collateralization
Recovery assumptions are important for pricing credit derivatives. If the reference entity under a

CDS contract defaults, the best assumption, as pointed out by J. P. Morgan (1999), is that the recovered

7

value equals the recovery rate times the face value plus accrued interest2. In other words, the recovery of
par value assumption is a better fit upon the default of the reference entity, whereas the recovery of
market value assumption is a more suitable choice in the event of a counterparty default3.
Let valuation date be t. Suppose that a CDS has m scheduled payments represented as
X i = −sN (Ti −1 , Ti ) with payment dates T1 ,…, Tm where i=1,,,,m,  (Ti −1 , Ti ) denotes the accrual factor for

period (Ti −1 , Ti ) , N denotes the notional/principal, and s denotes the CDS premium. Party A pays the
premium/fee to party B if reference entity C does not default. In return, party B agrees to pay the
protection amount to party A if reference entity C defaults before the maturity. We have the following
proposition.

In the market, there is an average accrual premium assumption, i.e., the average accrued premium is half

the full premium due to be paid at the end of the premium.

Three different recovery models exist in the literature. The default payoff is either i) a fraction of par

(Madan and Unal (1998)), ii) a fraction of an equivalent default-free bond (Jarrow and Turnbull (1995)),
or iii) a fraction of market value (Duffie and Singleton (1999)).

Proof: See the Appendix.
We may think of O(t , T ) as the risk-adjusted discount factor for the premium and (t , T ) as the
risk-adjusted discount factor for the default payment. Proposition 1 says that the pricing process of a
multiple-payment instrument has a backward nature since there is no way of knowing which risk-adjusted
discounting rate should be used without knowledge of the future value. Only on the maturity date, the
value of an instrument and the decision strategy are clear. Therefore, the evaluation must be done in a
backward fashion, working from the final payment date towards the present. This type of valuation
process is referred to as backward induction.
Proposition 1 provides a general form for pricing a CDS. Applying it to a particular situation in
which we assume that counterparties A and B are default-free, i.e., p j = 1 , q j = 0 ,  kl = 0 , and  ABC = 0 ,
where j=A or B and k, l=A, B, or C, we derive the following corollary.

If we further assume that the discount factor and the default probability of the reference entity are
uncorrelated and the recovery rate C is constant, we have
Corollary 2: Assume that i) counterparties A and B are default-free, ii) the discount factor and the default
probability of the reference entity are uncorrelated; iii) the recovery rate C is constant; the value of the
CDS is given by
V (t ) =  i =1 P(t , Ti ) pC (t , Ti −1 )qC (Ti −1, Ti )(N (1 − C ) −  (Ti −1, Ti ) ) − i =1 P(t , Ti ) pc (t , Ti ) sN  (Ti −1, Ti )

where P(t,Ti ) = ED(t ,Ti ) Ft  denotes the bond price, pc (t , Ti ) = Epc (t , Ti ) Ft  , qc (t , Ti ) = 1 − pc (t , Ti ) ,
p(t , Ti −1 )q (Ti −1 , Ti ) = p(t , Ti −1 ) − p(t , Ti ) .

This corollary is easily proved according to Corollary 1 by setting EXY Ft  = EX Ft EY Ft 
when X and Y are uncorrelated. Corollary 2 is the formula for pricing CDS in the market.
Our methodology can be extended to the cases where the number of parties n  4 . A generating

Risky valuation with collateralization
Collateralization is the most important and widely used technique in practice to mitigate credit

risk. The posting of collateral is regulated by the Credit Support Annex (CSA) that specifies a variety of
terms including the threshold, the independent amount, and the minimum transfer amount (MTA), etc.
The threshold is the unsecured credit exposure that a party is willing to bear. The minimum transfer
10

amount is the smallest amount of collateral that can be transferred. The independent amount plays the
same role as the initial margin (or haircuts).
In a typical collateral procedure, a financial instrument is periodically marked-to-market and the
collateral is adjusted to reflect changes in value. The collateral is called as soon as the mark-to-market
(MTM) value rises above the given collateral threshold, or more precisely, above the threshold amount
plus the minimum transfer amount. Thus, the collateral amount posted at time t is given by
V (t ) − H (t )
C (t ) = 
 0

if V (t )  H (t )

otherwise

where H (t ) is the collateral threshold. In particular, H (t ) = 0 corresponds to full-collateralization4; H  0
represents partial/under-collateralization; and H  0 is associated with over-collateralization. Full
collateralization becomes increasingly popular at the transaction level. In this paper, we focus on full
collateralization only, i.e., C (t ) = V (t ) .
The main role of collateral should be viewed as an improved recovery in the event of a
counterparty default. According to Bankruptcy law, if there has been no default, the collateral is returned
to the collateral giver by the collateral taker. If a default occurs, the collateral taker possesses the
collateral. In other words, collateral does not affect the survival payment; instead, it takes effect on the
default payment only.
According to the ISDA (2013), almost all CDSs are fully collateralized. Many people believe that
full collateralization can eliminate counterparty risk completely for CDS.
Collateral posting regimes are originally designed and utilized for bilateral risk products, e.g.,
IRS, but there are many reasons to be concerned about the success of collateral posting in offsetting the
risks of CDS contracts. First, the values of CDS contracts tend to move very suddenly with big jumps,

4

There are three types of collateralization: Full-collateralization is a process where the posting of

collateral is equal to the current MTM value. Partial/under-collateralization is a process where the posting
of collateral is less than the current MTM value. Over-collateralization is a process where the posting of
collateral is greater than the current MTM value.

11

whereas the price movements of IRS contracts are far smoother and less volatile than CDS prices.
Second, CDS spreads can widen very rapidly. The amount of collateral that one party is required to
provide at short notice may, in some cases, be close to the notional amount of the CDS and may therefore
exceed that party’s short-term liquidity capacity, thereby triggering a liquidity crisis. Third, CDS
contracts have many more risk factors than IRS contracts.
We assume that a CDS is fully collateralized, i.e., the posting of collateral is equal to the amount
of the current MTM value: C(t ) = V (t ) . For a discrete one-period (t, u) economy, there are several
possible states at time u: i) A, B, and C survive with probability p000 . The instrument value is equal to the
market value V (u) ; ii) A and B survive, but C defaults with probability p001 . The instrument value is the
default payment R(u) ; iii) For the remaining cases, either or both counterparties A and B default. The
instrument value is the future value of the collateral V (t ) / D(t , u) (Here we consider the time value of
money only). The value of the collateralized instrument at time t is the discounted expectation of all the
payoffs and is given by

V (t ) = ED(t , u ) p000 (t , u )V (u ) + p001 (t , u ) R(u )

+ ( p100 (t , u ) + p010 (t , u ) + p110 (t , u ) + p101 (t , u ) + p011 (t , u ) + p111 (t , u ) ) V (t ) / D(t , u ) Ft  (14a)

= ED(t , u )( p000 (t , u )V ( s) + p001 (t , u ) R(u ) ) + (1 − p000 (t , u ) − p001 (t , u ) )V (t ) Ft 

(14b)

and D(t , u)( pC (t , u)V (u) + qC (t , u) R(u)) are

uncorrelated, we have

The first term V F (t ) in equation (15) is the counterparty-risk-free value of the CDS and the
second term is the exposure left over under full collateralization, which can be substantial.
Proposition 2: If a CDS is fully collateralized, the risky value of the CDS is NOT equal to the
counterparty-risk-free value, as shown in equation (15).
Proposition 2 or equation (15) provides a theoretical explanation for the failure of full
collateralization in the CDS market. It tells us that under full collateralization the risky value is in general
not equal to the counterparty-risk-free value except in one of the following situations: i) the market value
is equal to the default payment, i.e., V (u) = R(u) ; ii) firms A, B, and C have independent credit risks, i.e.,

 ij =0 and  ABC = 0 ; or iii) the following relationship holds p B AC + p A BC =  ABC .

Numerical Results
Our goal in this section is to study the quantitative relationship between CDS premia and the

credit quality of counterparties and reference entities, including the default correlations and comrelations.
In our study, we choose a new 5-year CDS with a quarterly payment frequency. Two
counterparties are denoted as A and B. Counterparty A buys a protection from counterparty B. All
calculations are from the perspective of party A. By definition, a breakeven CDS spread is a premium that
makes the market value of a given CDS at inception zero.
The current (spot) market data are shown in Table 1 provide by FinPricing (2018). Assume that
the reference entity C has an “A+200bps” credit quality throughout this subsection. The 5-year
counterparty-risk-free CDS premium is 0.027 (equals the 5-year ‘A’ rated CDS spread in Table 1 plus
200 basis points).

13

Since the payoffs of a CDS are mainly determined by credit events, we need to characterize the
evolution of the hazard rates. Here we choose the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. The CIR process has
been widely used in the literature of credit risk and is given by

dht = a(b − ht )dt +  ht dWt

(16)

where a denotes the mean reversion speed, b denotes the long-term mean, and  denotes the volatility.

The calibrated parameters are shown in table 2. We assume that interest rates are deterministic
and select the regression-based Monte-Carlo simulation (see Longstaff and Schwartz (2001)) to perform
risky valuation.

14

We first assume that counterparties A, B, and reference entity C have independent default risks,
i.e.,  AB =  AC =  BC =  AB =  ABC = 0 , and examine the following cases: i) B is risk-free and A is risky;
and ii) A is risk-free and B is risky. We simulate the hazard rates using the CIR model and then determine
the appropriate discount factors according to Proposition 1. Finally we calculate the prices via the
regression-based Monte-Carlo method. The results are shown in Table 3 and 4.

Table 3: Impact of the credit quality of the protection buyer on CDS premia
This table shows how the CDS premium increases as the credit quality of party A decreases. The 1st data

From table 3 and 4, we find that a credit spread of about 100 basis points maps into a CDS
premium of about 0.4 basis points for counterparty A and about -0.7 basis points for counterparty B. The
credit impact on the CDS premia is approximately linear. As would be expected, i) the dealer’s credit
quality has a larger impact on CDS premia than the investor’s credit quality; ii) the higher the investor’s
credit risk, the higher the premium that the dealer charges; iii) the higher the dealer’s credit risk, the lower
the premium that the dealer asks. Without considering default correlations and comrelations, we find that,
in general, the impact of counterparty risk on CDS premia is relatively small. This is in line with the
empirical findings of Arora, Gandhi, and Longstaff (2009).

Figure 1: Impact of default correlations and comrelation on CDS premia
Each curve in this figure illustrates how CDS premium changes as default correlations and comrelation
move from -1 to 1. For instance, the curve ‘cor_BC’ represents the sensitivity of the CDS premium to
changes in the correlation  BC when  AB =  AC =  ABC = 0 .

Next, we study the sensitivity of CDS premia to changes in the joint credit quality of associated
parties. Sensitivity analysis is a very popular way in finance to find out how the value and risk of an
instrument/portfolio changes if risk factors change. One of the simplest and most common approaches
involves changing one factor at a time to see what effect this produces on the output. We are going to
examine the impacts of the default correlations  AB ,  AC ,  BC , and the comrelation  ABC separately.
Assume that party A has an ‘A+100bps’ credit quality and party B has an ‘A’ credit quality. The 5-year
risky CDS premium is calculated as 0.02703.
Assume  AB =0.5. The impact diagrams of the default correlations and comrelation are shown in
Figure 1. From this graph, we can draw the following conclusions: First, the CDS premium and the
default correlations/comrelation have a negative relation. Intuitively, a protection seller who is positively
correlated with the reference entity (a wrong way risk) should charge a lower premium for selling credit
protection. Next, the impacts of the default correlations and comrelation are approximately linear. Finally,
the sensitivity slopes of the CDS premium to the default correlations and comrelation are -0.06 to  AB ; 0.09 to  AC ; -53 to  BC ; and -14 to  ABC . Slope measures the rate of change in the premium as a result
of a change in the default dependence. For instance, a slope of -53 implies that the CDS premium would
have to decrease by 53 basis points when a default correlation/comrelation changes from 0 to 1.
As the absolute value of the slope increases, so does the sensitivity. The results illustrate that  BC
has the largest effect on CDS premia. The second biggest one is  ABC . The impacts of  AB and  AC are
very small. In particular, the effect of the comrelation is substantial and has never been studies before. A
natural intuition to have on CDS is that the party buying default protection should worry about the default
correlations and comrelation.

4 Conclusion
This article presents a new valuation framework for pricing financial instruments subject to credit
risk. In particular, we focus on modeling default relationships.

17

To capture the default relationships among more than two defaultable entities, we introduce a
new statistic: comrelation, an analogue to correlation for multiple variables, to exploit any multivariate
statistical relationship. Our research shows that accounting for default correlations and comrelations
becomes important, especially under market stress. The existing valuation models in the credit derivatives
market, which take into account only pair-wise default correlations, may underestimate credit risk and
may be inappropriate.
We study the sensitivity of the price of a defaultable instrument to changes in the joint credit
quality of the parties. For instance, our analysis shows that the effect of default dependence on CDS
premia from large to small is the correlation between the protection seller and the reference entity, the
comrelation, the correlation between the protection buyer and the reference entity, and the correlation
between the protection buyer and the protection seller.
The model shows that a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one. Therefore,
we conclude that collateralization designed to mitigate counterparty risk works well for financial
instruments subject to bilateral credit risk, but fails for ones subject to multilateral credit risk.

Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1. Let t = T0 . On the first payment date T1 , let V (T1 ) denote the market
value of the CDS excluding the current cash flow X 1 . There are a total of eight ( 2 3 = 8 ) possible states
shown in Table A_1.

Table A_1. Payoffs of a trilaterally defaultable CDS
This table shows all possible payoffs at time T1 . In the case of V (T1 ) + X 1  0 where V (T1 ) is the market
value excluding the current cash flow X 1 , there are a total of eight ( 2 3 = 8 ) possible states: i) A, B, and C
survive with probability p000 . The instrument value equals the market value: V (T1 ) + X 1 . ii) A defaults,
but B and C survive with probability p100 . The instrument value is a fraction of the market value:
18

 B (T1 )(V (T1 ) + X 1 ) where  B represents the non-default recovery rate of party B5.  B =0 represents the
one-way settlement rule, while  B =1 represents the two-way settlement rule. iii) A and C survive, but B
defaults with probability p010 . The instrument value is given by  B (T1 )(V (T1 ) + X 1 ) where  B represents
the default recovery rate of defaulting party B. iv) A and B survive, but C defaults with probability p001 .
The instrument value is the default payment: R (T0 , T1 ) . v) A and B default, but C survives with probability
p110 . The instrument value is given by  AB (T1 )(V (T1 ) + X 1 ) where  AB denotes the joint recovery rate

when both parties A and B default simultaneously. vi) A and C default, but B survives with probability
p101 . The instrument value is a fraction of the default payment:  B (T ) R(T0 , T1 ) . vii) B and C default, but A

survives with probability p011 , The instrument value is given by  B (T ) R(T0 , T1 ) . viii) A, B, and C default
with probability p111 . The instrument value is given by  AB (T ) R(T0 , T1 ) . A similar logic applies to the case
of V (T1 ) + X 1  0 .

There are two default settlement rules in the market. The one-way payment rule was specified by the

early ISDA master agreement. The non-defaulting party is not obligated to compensate the defaulting
party if the remaining market value of the instrument is positive for the defaulting party. The two-way
payment rule is based on current ISDA documentation. The non-defaulting party will pay the full market
value of the instrument to the defaulting party if the contract has positive value to the defaulting party.
