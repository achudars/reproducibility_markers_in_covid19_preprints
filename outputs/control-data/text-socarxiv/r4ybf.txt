Abstract
Writing in general, second language writing in particular, can be an obstacle for some students. The
reason why writing can be hard to learn is that writers face many challenges the moment they start
writing. The challenges could be from gathering the ideas to be written, planning of the outline,
focusing on sentence structure, choosing the appropriate expressions, and also making sure of the
organization. Moreover, these challenges can cause students to have negative attitudes towards
writing. Previous studies suggest that using writing strategies can help student control the writing
process which have a positive effect on their writing achievement and their attitudes towards
writing. The strategy of mind mapping is used as a pre-writing strategy to help writers visualize the
structure of their writing. However, the researcher proposes using mind mapping strategy not only
to organize ideas, but also to organize grammatical and linguistic knowledge. This study
investigates the effect of using this mind mapping strategy as a pre-writing strategy to enhance
female language learners’ writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing in English at Taif
University, Saudi Arabia. In a quasi-experimental design, a mixed methods approach was adopted
by collecting quantitative and qualitative data. The study population is 128 students in an
experimental group (n1= 57) and a control group (n2=71). The former received the treatment of

instruction using mind mapping strategy and the latter received traditional instruction. The
objectives of this study are first, to identify any differences between the mean scores of the
experimental group and the control group on post-tests of writing attitudes and writing
achievement; second, to identify differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of
writing attitudes and writing achievement for the experimental group; third, to explore students'
views concerning difficulties to write in English. fourth, to identify the strategies they used to
overcome these difficulties; fifth, to investigate if students thought that mind mapping helped them
write better and, if so, how. The researcher prepared a test to measure the writing achievement of
female first-year EFL students, and a questionnaire by Sturm (1996) to measure writing attitudes.
An interview was conducted with a focus group from the experimental group to achieve the third,
fourth and fifth objectives. Independent samples and paired sample t-tests were performed to
quantitively analyze data from the writing achievement test and the writing attitudes questionnaire.
Data collected from the interview were qualitatively analyzed. The finding of the current study are
first, there exists differences between the mean scores of the experimental and the control group on
the post-tests of the students` writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the
experimental group; second there exists significant differences between the mean scores of the
experimental group’s pre- and post-tests in writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of
the post-test; third, students’ difficulties to write in English include lack of vocabulary,
organization, spelling and grammar; fourth, students are accustomed to memorizing, practicing, and
self-correcting, which indicates they are not used to planning their writing; finally, students also
positively perceived the strategy of mind mapping and thought it helped them to better write in
English.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
Along with reading and understanding, writing is an indispensable part of the
acquisition of a foreign language. Additionally, writing skills are an indicator of
educational achievement and a prerequisite for involvement in civil life and
participation in the international economy. Writing is one of the most significant skills
in education, especially in English as a foreign language, as it shows a student’s ability
to master the writing techniques, to compose, and to present his or her ideas. In order
to do so, students must be aware of writing as a practical and productive process, as
well as abide by writing rules and conventions such as knowledge, management, and
control of techniques (Anwar, 2000). However, some experts today assert that a large
number of students are graduating from school without basic writing skills (Dean,
2010).
Although Saudi (EFL) students undergo long years of preparation at secondary
schools, they often experience difficulties at the university in writing in English (Al
Asmari, 2013). Although they need to use English as a means of acquiring content,
students often have to struggle with language learning at the expense of content
acquisition (Sidek, 2010).
Writing in English is complex (Kroll, 1990). In general, writing difficulties first
arise when the writer is trying to gather ideas and feelings on a particular subject.
Problems in strategic issues such as the process of organizing ideas, the ability to
generate and organize relevant important ideas (whether the prose is grammatically
correct or not), the use of correct punctuation tools, the accurate spelling of what is
written, and some rhetorical and linguistic tasks in drafting, are all dependent on writing
skills (Deane, Odendahl., Quinlan, Fowles, Welsh & Bivens‐Tatum, 2008). Previous
1

research indicates that one of the causes of weak writing skills is the poor attitudes that
students exhibit towards writing. Students often consider themselves to be unskilled
writers and this causes them to be less engaged in the process of writing. (Hashemian
& Heidari, 2013; Al Asmari, 2013)
Some researchers believe that the practice of writing and the use of certain
strategies in teachers education and training enables them to concentrate on different
parts of the writing process. Strategies also give students the freedom to experience
their language, because such directions can help them develop their confidence,
creating fluency in writing skills, with less concern about the final product of their
writings (Alodwan & Ibnian, 2014; Okasha & Hamdi, 2014).
Strategic writing is defined as the process of using a variety of strategies and
skills to achieve a specific objective or to master a particular process and task (Okasha
& Hamdi, 2014). Strategies can not simply be learned by reading textbooks or listening
to instructions. The interactive nature of strategies requires them to be constructed over
time, by gradually decreasing teachers' assistance and increasing the students' role and
self-control in the learning process (Calhoun, & Hale, 2003). Okash & Hamdi (2014)
proposes four instructional steps to teach strategies. The process starts with finding a
strategy worth teaching, followed by demonstrating the strategy to students. Afterward,
students are assisted in practicing the strategy. Finally, students can work on
maintaining the mastery of the strategy independently.
Mind mapping strategy was first popularized by Buzan (1993, p.59) who defines
it as an instructional strategy where the learners locate “supra-ordinate concepts on
paper and subsequently link sub-ordinate concepts as appropriate". McGriff (2000) (as
cited in Al Naqbi, 2011) states that the strategy of mind mapping is perceived as a tool

2

that can help its users to overcome problems related to the organization of ideas because
it offers an excellent way to organize knowledge.
Consequently, mind mapping strategy is used as an instructional strategy in
many areas of education. It has an encouraging impact and is positively perceived by
both students and teachers in areas such as science, executive education, and
mathematics (Mento, Martinelli, & Jones, 1999; Goodnough & Long, 2002;
Brinkmann, 2003; Abi‐El‐Mona & Adb‐El‐Khalick, 2008; D'Antoni & Pianto Zipp,
2005). Furthermore, mind mapping strategy offeres a practical cognitive aid that is
successfully used in EFL classes to help teachers teach and students acquire and master
different skills. The strategy of mind mapping is found to be effective in teaching skills
like spelling and reading (Al-Jarf, 2011; Manoli & Papadopoulou, 2012; Khajavi &
Ketabi, 2012).
Furthermore, mind mapping strategy is successfully used as a pre-writing
strategy to help students plan and organize ideas and knowledge for the writing task.
As asserted by Fiktorius (2013) mind mapping strategy is an effective method used to
improve writing in foreign language classes. According to Elftorp (2007), students
begin to write their own ideas on a particular subject and then draw a mind map that
illustrates the main idea of writing and the secondary ideas that emerge from it, which
helps them to formulate ideas, increase them, then write those ideas. During this process
the teacher plays an active role in inspiring students and creating an atmosphere for
writing.
Many empirical studies show the positive impact that mind mapping has on
students’ writing achievement (Al Naqbi, 2011; Khudhair, 2016; and Shakoori, Kadivar
& Sarami, 2017). Besides using hand-drawn maps, some studies have also examined
the use of mind mapping software to plan students' writing (Al-Jarf, 2009; Zaid, 2011).
3

The studies shed some light on the ability of mind mapping to help students generate
and organize ideas and to assist them in writing longer and better texts. Students also
appreciate that mind maps helped them retrieve the knowledge they needed to write
before they started writing (Al Naqbi, 2011; Khudhair, 2016). Furthermore, Al Naqbi
(2011) noticed a slight yet distinct improvement in students' writings in exam
conditions.
Along with its positive affect on the writing achievement, several studies found
that mind mapping also has a positive impact on students' attitudes towards writing and
writing tasks (Saed & Al-Omari, 2014; Shakoori & Kadivar, 2015; Tayib, 2015). This
can be due to the fact that students have viewed mind mapping as a fun and reliable
way to start their writing, as was suggested by Nurlaila (2013) and Al-Jarf (2009).
To summarize, mind mapping can help students deal with the structural and
conceptual elements of writing paragraphs. It can also help students organize, store and
recall knowledge and information needed for the writing task. Generally, mind mapping
involves writing down a central idea and relating it to a few secondary ideas. These
secondary ideas are the centre points of new ideas. Accordingly, mind mapping can
guide students in visualizing the structure of the paragraph. It can also direct them to
generate more ideas and can help them gather related second language vocabulary and
grammatical knowledge needed to demonstrate their ideas.
1.2 Statement of the problem
Writing is one of the most important, yet problematic skills involved in the
educational process in general and language learning in particular. However, as noted
by Santangelo & Harris (2008), studies indicate that only one out of every five high
school students get the required knowledge and skills to write before they reach
university. Alnofal (2003) assertes that Saudi students, in general, lack the knowledge
4

of how to approach the act of writing in both their native language and second language,
and that they only learn what to write, but not how to write it. It means that Saudis
usually use rote learning as their method of choice. Aljamhoor (1996) states that
students and teachers in EFL classrooms believe that the more students memorize
vocabulary, the better writers they will be. However, his comes at the expense of other
important writing techniques like planning and organization.
Studies investigating the writing skill of students at Taif University show that
students have very low writing achievement and severe writing problems. A study by
Al-Khairy (2013) shows that students struggle on the sentence level and encounter
many difficulties in writing beyond paragraph level. Another study by Javid & Umer
(2014) reveals that students at Taif University have a severe lack of ability in using
vocabulary, organization of ideas, and grammar, which strongly affect their writing
achievement.
Another factor which affects students’ writing is their attitudes towards writing
in English. Phinney (1991) asserts that writers usually have more negative attitudes and
apprehension when they write in a foreign language than while writing in their native
language. Students usually feel incompetent when they write in a foreign language
(Peng, 2011). The importance of studying writing attitudes comes from the effect that
writing attitudes has on writing achievement (Hashemian & Heidari, 2013). Al Asmari
(2013) shows that low writing achievement is associated with negative writing
attitudes.
As suggested by Okasha & Hamdi (2014), difficulties in writing can be a result
of shortcomings on the strategic aspect, which would make students unable to access
knowledge they already possess. The research questions in this study are derived from
5

the need to search for innovative teaching strategies to teach languages in general and
writing skills specifically, to EFL students at Taif University .
Accordingly, strategies, based on the understanding of how the mind works, can
reduce the cognitive load and ultimately facilitate the writing process (Mayer, 2002).
In addition, since writing is considered a product dependent on other language and
organization skills, any lack of those skills can have a negative effect on writing. The
use of untraditional yet empirically supported pre-writing or planning strategies like the
mind mapping strategy can help students manage all the linguistic and organizational
skills to ultimately enhance their writing and their attitudes towards writing.
Thus, the objective of this study is mainly to determine the effect of using mind
mapping strategy in a way that can enhance second language learners' writing skills, by
helping them write well-structured sentences, as well as to improve their attitudes
towards writing. In addition, the researcher is interested in exploring the difficulties
faced by EFL learners and the strategies they use to overcome them and to find out
whether students think that mind aping strategy helped improve their English writing.
1.3 Research questions:
By this study, the researcher’s objective is to determine responses to the
following research questions.
1. Are there any significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental
group and the control group on the post-tests of the students` writing attitudes and
writing achievement?
2. Are there any significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and posttests of writing attitudes and writing achievement for the experimental group?
3. What are the difficulties that the students face in writing in English?
6

4. Which strategies do they use to overcome these problems?
5. Do female students think that mind mapping helped them write better and how?
1.4 Objectives of the Study
The main objective of this study is to explore the effect of using the strategy of
mind mapping on the writing achievement and attitudes in the writing of first-year
female Saudi EFL students at Taif University. In particular, the following objectives
derive from the main one as follows.
1. To identify the differences between the mean scores of the experimental group
and the control group on the post-tests of the students` writing attitudes and
writing achievement.
2. To identify the differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests
of writing attitudes and writing achievement for the experimental group.
3. To explore the students' views concerning the difficulties they face while
writing in English.
4.

To identify the strategies students use to overcome their writing problems.

5. To explore if female students think that mind mapping helped them write better
and, if so, how it helped them.
1.5 Significance of the Study
Successful education for students necessitates that they learn the skills required
to produce a wide range of texts for different purposes and social contexts. Writing
skills are described as a complex cognitive activity that involves problem- solving and
has deployment strategies to achieve communication objectives (Dean et al., 2008).
Therefore, the importance of this study lies in the importance of the topic that it
addresses "The Effect of Using Mind Maps to Enhance EFL Learners’ Writing
Achievement and Students` Attitudes towards Writing at Taif University".
7

As well as the importance of using writing as a means of generating ideas for
first-year EFL students, writing is also an important process by which they can convey
their ideas and opinions to all. There is a need to improve the writing abilities and
efficiency among the students, which improves the quality of teaching and learning.
According to the researcher’s knowledge, someone can say that Saudi school
students do not receive any specific writing instruction in their native language nor in
English. Therefore, for the most part, first-year university students can be considered
unskilled writers and writing in a foreign language is even more intimidating for them.
The main objective of this study is to examine mind mapping as pre-writing strategy,
with a view to enhance Taif university first-year female Saudi EFL students’ writing
achievement and attitudes towards writing.
On one hand, there is a paucity of previous research on using mind maps to
enhance EFL learners’ writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing in Saudi
universities in general and in Taif University in particular. Additionally, the researcher
proposes a new way to use the mind mapping strategy to help students overcome
problems at the sentence level, by adding grammatical clues and syntactical pathways
inside the map.
On the other hand, this instructional program contributes positively to the
creation of real value in academic research in the field of learning strategies,
particularly mind mapping strategy. Furthermore, it encourages other researchers to
prepare and develop related studies that support this field in order to achieve desired
goals in the future.
The present study is expected to offer considerable proof of the explicit impact
of mind mapping on students' writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing.
In addition, the results of the study will be particularly important for teaching English
8

as a second language at Taif University. Additionally, it can be reflected on other Saudi
universities through the identification and analysis of the effect of mind maps on EFL
learners’ writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing.
Finally, this study increases the toolkit available to instructors of EFL students
in Saudi universities.
1.6 Variables of the Study
This section contains the theoretical framework, determine the variables, and
explain each one of the variables to construct the hypotheses. As this study examines
the effect of using mind maps to enhance EFL learners’ writing achievement and
attitudes towards writing at Taif University. Figure (1.1) illustrates how the
independent variable and the dependent variables are related to each other. The
independent variable is the treatment of mind mapping and the dependent variables are

1.6.1 Study hypotheses
The researcher, in the present study, seeks to accept or reject five main
hypotheses, where H stands for hypothesis.
H1 There are significant differences between the mean scores of experimental group
and the control group on the writing achievement post-tests of the first-year female
Saudi EFL students and their attitudes toward writing in favor of the experimental
group. The corresponding null hypothesis is that there are no differences between
the experimental and control groups on the post-test.
H2 There exists significant differences between the mean scores of the pre- and
post-tests of the first-year female Saudi EFL students' writing achievement and
attitudes towards writing, who have received mind mapping training, in favour of
the post-tests. The corresponding null hypothesis is that there are no significant
10

differences between the mean scores of the experimental group when the pre-test
and post-tests are compared
H3 Saudi first-year EFL students face difficulties writing in English on the sentence
level.
The corresponding null hypothesis is that they do not face difficulties writing
sentences in English.
H4 Students do not use pre-writing strategies to plan their writing. The
corresponding null hypothesis is that they use pre-writing strategies to plan their
writing.
H5 Students think that using mind mapping helped them write better.

The

corresponding null hypothesis is that they do not think it helped them.
1.7 Limitations of the Study
The present study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration.
1. The study investigated the effect of mind mapping on English writing skills
only. Other skills are measured using different instruments than the ones
used during the present study.
2. The data were only collected from Taif University, as it is difficult to
implement the mind mapping program and collect data from different
universities in different cities in Saudi Arabia.
3. The participants are all female students. Therefore, gender differences were
not considered.
4. Students’ different learning styles were not investigated for any potential
relation between the effect of the strategy and the students’ learning styles.

11

5. The participants are first-year EFL students. Therefore, the applicability and
the success of the mind mapping program cannot be generalized to other
levels without further research.
1.8 Definition of Terms
1. Mind Mapping Strategy is a strategy where learners locate "supra-ordinate
concepts on paper and subsequently link sub-ordinate concepts as appropriate"
(Buzan, 1993, p.59). The researcher defines the mind mapping strategy as a
visual organizer where students organize their ideas as well as organizing
grammatical and lexical knowledge needed for expressing those ideas. (see
Appendix C for examples)
2. Writing Strategies are the ways or methods that a person uses to organize
cognitive activities such as panning, formulating and reviewing (Kieft,
Rijlaarsdam & van den Bergh, 2006).
3. Writing Achievement indicates students' performance in the writing task in
terms of content, organization, vocabulary and grammar.
4. Writing attitudes expresses students’ general attitudes towards writing in
English in terms of enjoyment, ease, competence and strategy use.
5. EFL Students refers to students who are taking an English course in university
although it is not considered a primary language in their countries.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This section of the study offers an overview of the main ideas and concepts of
the study and its variables to explain its objectives. Previous studies in the same field
are summarized to achieve a better understanding of the topic. The sections of this
chapter explicate the main issues of this study, such as the theoretical framework which
derives from cognitive learning theories, specifically, from the Cognitive Theory of
Multimedia Learning (CTML), by Mayer (1997), and its assumptions, implications and
applications inside the classroom. Furthermore, this section presents a review of the
writing and writing models in general. In addition, the strategy of mind mapping is
explained. Previous studies on the relationship between the writing strategies and
writing achievement, and between the writing strategies and writing attitudes is
addressed. Some studies investigating the use of mind mapping as a writing strategy
are reviewed.
2.2 Cognitivism
Cognitivism, that gained acceptance in the 1950s, is a broad theoretical
framework for understanding the human mind. Unlike behaviorism, where the human
brain is perceived as a closed box that can only be understood by its products,
cognitivism actually pay more attention to the processes inside the human brain (Ertmer
& Newby, 1993). Cognitive theories consider learning an internal mental schema of
knowledge which includes the recall of stored information. The focus is on how the
brain acquires, structures and processes information (Schunk, 1996). Leonard (2002,
p.29) states that "The focus of cognitivism on learning, therefore, is how learners
process inputs and outputs mentally in order to understand how people think, learn,
transmit information, and solve problems".
14

According to the cognitive theory of learning, students learn through the mental
processing of information and through learning how to process information. This
approach can be practiced inside the classroom by using visual aids, mind mapping
tools, and rehearsals, along with mnemonics to help students store, process and recall
information. The goal of instruction is to change the student's mental behavior.
Moreover, creating an active learner is of vital importance. According to this approach,
the teacher's role is not to be the sole source of information but instead to draw and
maintain learners' attention while teaching them strategies that foster their learning
(Zhou, 2004).
2.2.1 The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML)

The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) is a theory proposed
and developed by Mayer (1997). The fundamental hypothesis underlying this theory is
that multimedia instructional methods based on the understanding of how the human
mind works, are more likely to lead to meaningful learning than those that are not
(Mayer, 1997). Mayer & Moreno (2003) define multimedia learning as learning from
words and pictures. Accordingly, multimedia instruction means presenting information
using words and pictures simultaneously to foster learning. The words can be printed
or spoken, the pictures can be static or dynamic. Furthermore, Mayer & Moreno (2003,
p.43) define meaningful learning as "deep understanding of the material, which
includes attending to important aspects of the presented material, mentally organizing
it into a coherent cognitive structure, and integrating it with relevant existing
knowledge".
According to Mayer (2005), the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
(CTML) relies on three cognitive science assumptions. The first assumption, called the
dual-channels assumption, is that the information processing system in the human brain
15

has two channels: one for visual or pictorial processing and one for auditory or verbal
processing. The second assumption, the limited capacity assumption, is that the
processing capacity for each channel is finite. The third assumption, called the active
processing assumption, is that active learning requires handling a set of coordinated
cognitive processes. According to Mayer (1996), these processes include the selecting
and organizing of incoming information as well as integrating this information with
existing knowledge. These processes help construct a mental model for acquired
knowledge.
It is important to note how printed words are processed in the dual channel
system. Mayer (2002, p.27) asserts that " Processing of pictures occurs mainly in the
visual/pictorial channel, and processing of spoken words occurs mainly in the
auditory/verbal channel; however, processing of printed words takes place initially in
the visual/pictorial channel and then moves to the auditory/verbal channel". Figure 2.1
illustrates how information is processed in the human mind according to the Cognitive
Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Pictures and words are processed by pictorial
and auditory channels respectively. Selected images and sounds are then learner
constructs a coherent representation of words and pictures in the working memory with
the help of previous knowledge from the long-memory (Mayer & Moreno, 2003).

.

Adopted from (Mayer & Moereno, 2003, p.44)
According to Mayer (2002) multimedia design is based on nine principles. However,
the researcher's mind mapping strategy relies on the first, second and third principles.
The principles are:
1) The Multimedia principle: students learn better from associating words and
pictures than from presenting words alone.
2) The Spatial Contiguity principle: students learn better when corresponding words
and pictures are displayed near each other rather than far from each other on the
paper or screen.
3) The Temporal Contiguity principle: students learn better when related words and
pictures are presented at once rather than one after another.
4) The Coherence Principle: students learn better when the unimportant material is
omitted rather than contained.
5) The Modality principle: students learn better from videos or animation with voice
over or narration rather than from videos and on-screen text.
6) The Redundancy principle: students learn better from videos with voice-over than
from videos, voice-over, and on-screen text.

17

7) The Pre-training principle: students learn better when training on components
comes before, not after, the message.
8) The Signaling principle: students learn better when undergoing signaled training
rather than non-signaled training.
9) The Personalization principle: students learn better when words are presented in an
informal style instead of a formal style.
To summarize, information in the human mind is processed through a dual
channel system; one for auditory or verbal and one for visual or pictorial processing
and each of these channels has a limited processing capacity. Noticeably, printed words
are first processed in the visual channel and then converted to be processed by the
auditory channel. The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) also assumes
that active learning involves managing several coordinated cognitive processes. The
aim of instructional design according to this theory is to use instructional tools as well
as learning strategies designed to help students process, store and recall information.
Because mind maps present words, pictures, and associations, mind mapping strategy
is proposed as an instructional tool to help students pre-write.
2.3 Writing
Writing is often perceived as a simple representation of speech, but it is more
than that. Writing displays the knowledge, perspective and communication ability of
the writers or the language users (Bachman, 1990). “Writing” as a noun refers to the
written text while “writing” as a verb means the act of forming a text. Widdowson
(1983) states that writing mainly serves communication, meaning that writing is not
only the process of text production; rather, it is a communicative activity that follows
the general principles which describe the use of language in communication.

18

Grabe & Kaplan (1996, p.6) pointed out that writing is a set of skills that "must
be practiced and learned through experience". The fact that writing is not acquired
naturally and that it needs conscious effort and practice makes it problematic for
learners. According to Kroll (1990), since writing is a complicated task for native
speakers, writing can be even more challenging for non-native speakers.
Most writers and students consider writing a very challenging and complex
cognitive task. Smith (1989, p.33) argued that writers are not “simply putting what their
brain knows or can do on paper”. Writing is a very complex skill to learn and to teach,
because it requires writers to master, control and be aware of different variables at the
same time. Raimes (1985) concurred that a writers' task is not an easy one, because
writers struggle with their cognitive experience. In other words, writers must handle
and manipulate several cognitive processes simultaneously. They think and search for
ideas, they organize, develop, revise and formulate their ideas into the best possible
way to communicate their message to their audience clearly and effectively. Some
researchers believe that writing has a strong relationship to thinking. Flower and Hayes
(1981, p.366) believes that“writing is a set of distinctive thinking processes” in which
the writer must engage simultaneously.
According to Deane et al. (2008), the most important written skills are those
related to form (document-level skills), which refers to the organization of the written
text. Second in importance are method skills (sentence level skills): vocabulary,
spelling and grammar. Third in importance are content-related skills, related to ideas,
logical sequence and the quality of meaning.
Moreover, literary expression has received increasing international attention in
studies and research on language education. The National Council of Teachers of
English has published booklets on the role of teachers in helping students with the right
19

language learning and writing, in addition to how to evaluate students and their writings
(Norton, 2003).
2.3.1 Development of writing research
Writing has been researched for a long time and has undergone a paradigm
shift in the last thirty years (Alhaysony, 2008). Although the main interest of this
study lies directly with the writing as a process paradigm, and specifically the writing
strategies used during the stages of the writing processes, writing as a product
paradigm will be briefly discussed in order to fully understand aspects of writing and
writing research.
For many years, teaching writing and research on writing focused on the final
written product, i.e. the quality and the accuracy of the resulting text. Texts were seen
as groups of vocabulary words forming syntactic structures with no attention to
audience or purpose. Alhaysony (2008) said that the accepted assumption was that
writers knew what they wanted to write and only needed to find the proper forms to
express their ideas. It was also believed that writers proceeded systematically, from one
step to the next one, linearly. Therefore, writings or texts in EFL classrooms adopting
this paradigm were more of a manifestation of the students' second language
competence. Teachers encouraged students to correctly use the vocabulary and
grammatical structures learned in their classrooms. Since students have limited
vocabulary, students were expected to write very similar texts. According to Schmitt
(2010, p.239), teaching traditions following this paradigm gave more attention to
formal accuracy. As a result, teachers employed a precise program that promoted habit
formation in an effort to avoid errors. For the most part, students were asked to imitate
and manipulate carefully constructed models as writing activities. Schmitt (2010,

20

p.239) added that teachers in EFL classrooms were “editors favoring linguistic features
over ideas”.
In text or product-based research, as described by Hyland (2002, p.6), the
writings or texts were assumed to be “autonomous objects which can be analyzed and
described independently of particular contexts, writers or readers". Norment (1982)
investigated the relationship between narrative and expository English texts produced
by native and non-native writers. Similarly, a quantitative analysis by Reid (1988)
showed the differences in English prose written by native and non-native writers.
Among other variables, Reid (1988) also looked at the use of cohesive devices by
writers from different linguistic backgrounds.
Subsequently, writing research began to shift from asking what writers write?
to asking how do writers write? Today, the emphasis is directed toward studying writers
and writing as a process instead of only treating writing as a product. Researchers have
examined variables affecting writers and the writing processes and strategies. In
addition, connections between second language writing and first language writing,
writers’ attitudes, writing apprehension, and learning style are issues of interest in this
line of research (Schmitt, 2010).
In the classroom, teachers were less concerned about the written text and paid
more attention to helping students develop and manage their writing. In addition,
according to Schmitt (2010, p.241), the goal of process tradition in second language
classrooms became to enable students to use and develop practical strategies for getting
started, drafting, revising, and editing.
2.3.2 Writing models
For the last few decades, researchers have been trying to construct a writing
model. Based on the empirical findings from research on L1 writing, many models have
21

been proposed, of which the Flower & Hayes's (1980) cognitive model of the writing
process has been of the most influential. This model will be reviewed briefly because
it stresses the importance of using strategies to manage the writing process.
2.3.2.1 Flower & Hayes's cognitive model of the writing process
Toward the end of the twentieth century, Flower & Hayes (1980) were the first
to link composing and writing to cognitive psychology. They considered writing a
cognitive process and employed the protocols analysis technique, a method in
psychological research to elicit verbal records from participants and to study thinking
in cognitive psychology, to find out what writers do while they write (Crutcher, 1994).
According to Flower & Hayes (1981, p.369), the “writer's world" is divided into three
components: "task environment", "the writer's long-term memory (LTM)" and "the
writing process". The first component, task environment, includes aspects external to
the writer presumed to have an impact on the writing process such as the writing
assignment and audience. In addition, the text produced during the act of writing
becomes eventually a part of the task environment. The second component, the writer's
long-term memory, includes the writer's general knowledge about the topic, the
audience, writing plans, strategies and also the writer's knowledge of language,
grammar and vocabulary, particularly crucial for L2 writing. The third component is
the writing process itself. Figure 2.2 shows the Flower & Hayes writing process model.

22

Figure 2.2: The Flower & Hayes writing process model

Adopted from (Flower & Hayes, 1981, p.370).
The activities that occur during the writing process were classified with an
emphasis on identifying the cognitive processes involved, into four major writing
processes: planning, translating, reviewing and monitoring. In the planning process, the
writing assignment and long-term memory are considered as input, which then
produces a conceptual plan for the document as output (Flower & Hayes, 1980). In
addition, planning includes the sub-activities of generating ideas, organizing (arranging
those ideas logically in one’s head), and goal setting (determining desired effects and
modifying one’s generating and organizing activities to achieve local or global goals).
The translating process is responsible for the production of what has been conceptually
planned during the planning process. The text is revised, modified and improved upon
in the reviewing process. All the previous processes are linked and coordinated using
meta-cognitive processes included in the monitoring process. These processes are not
necessarily consecutive, so planning, translating and revising can occur at any moment
during writing. Therefore, they are presented as cognitive processes rather than stages
(Flower & Hayes, 1980).
23

The Flower & Hayes model is based on four central points: First, writing is a
group of distinct thinking processes, which writers arrange and coordinate during
writing. Second, the cognitive writing processes are organized in a hierarchical way,
where processes are embedded within each other, do not follow any specific order.
Third, the act of writing is a goal-directed thinking process, which is directed by the
writer's own growing network of goals. Fourth, the last key point is that writers generate
high-level goals and low-level goals. High-level goals are meant to direct the entire
writing process. Low-level goals, on the other hand, are sub-goals which deal with
operational goals related to local writing tasks.
Flower & Hayes (1980) conclude that writing is interactive and recursive, rather
than linear, and offere a theoretical framework for future research. However, the Flower
& Hayes model is criticized for the assumption that there is a single writing process for
all writers, skilled or less skilled writers, alike (Alhaysony, 2008).
According to Flower & Hayes, good and poor writers do the same things while they
write, only good writers do them better. In response to critics, Alhaysony (2008) argued
that the model has the ability to handle a great variety of variation in what is done in
different boxes and in the order.
To summarize, this researcher asserts that writing pedagogy and research were
remarkably influenced by Flower & Hayes's model, and considerable work has been on
extending the model to account for L2 writing. This researcher assumes that L2 writers
go through the same process as L1 writers, and therefore introduces mind mapping as
a pre-writing strategy to be used during the planning process.

24

2.4 The Strategy of Mind Mapping
One of the main contributions of writing process research is the recognition of
writing strategies. The term “strategy” has been defined by many researchers. In the
field of language learning, Cohen (1998, p.7) defined strategies as "Thoughts and
actions, consciously chosen and operationalized by language learners, to assist them in
carrying out a multiplicity of tasks from the very onset of learning to the most advanced
levels of target-language performance". Likewise, Leki (1995) defined strategies as the
sort of actions writers carry out to produce a written text. A more recent definition was
offered by Kieft et al. (2006) who considers writing strategies to be the ways or methods
that a person uses to organize cognitive activities such as planning, formulating and
reviewing.
Mind mapping is one strategy used in education, described by Zaid (1995) (as
cited in Saed & AL-Omari (2014, p.92) as “a picture worth a thousand words”.
According to Buzan (2006) a mind map is a strategy for thinking and organizing
information in a clear and visual manner and in enjoyable ways, using forms, colours
or sketches, and clarifying the relationships between elements.
The basic idea in cognitive psychology is that learning occurs by assimilating
new concepts and propositions into lists and frameworks proposed by the learner. This
knowledge structure, maintained by the learner, is also referred to as the cognitive
structure of the individual (Novak & Canas, 2006). Thus, meaningful learning results
when people associate new knowledge with relevant concepts and knowledge that they
already possess. According to Novak & Canas (2006), this contributes to making
learning meaningful, durable and strong, whereas rote learning is easily forgotten and
not easily applied in new learning or problem-solving situations.
25

Mind mapping has been used as a learning tool and for teaching different
language skills. Mind mapping was first proposed by Tony Busan in the late 1960s and
then, as noted by Saed & AL-Omari (2014), mind mapping was further developed by
Joseph Novak and his research team at Cornell University in the early 1970s. The use
of mind mapping has shown important results in improving composition. In addition,
mind mapping can be used as a blueprint for writing a short essay on a subject, or a part
of the map can be used to write a paragraph. Mind mapping proved to be useful before,
during and after writing (Zaid, 2011). Mind mapping also helps students see the
relationship between ideas and communication, between known information and new
information. Furthermore, mind mapping is a valuable tool for developing vocabulary
and conceptual understanding in students. It can help writers commit to a topic by
putting their ideas in front of them as they write and also helps them keep ideas in order.
Mind mapping is also a tool that can guide students through the four stages of writing:
writing, drafting, editing, and revision (Saed & AL-Omari, 2014).
Tucker, Armstrong, & Massad (2010) defined the mind map as a visual tool to
organize and relate themes, objectives and the relationships between them by adding
images and drawings that show the general structure of the problem and the topic to be
studied in a way that attracts the learner's attention and helps him or her to understand.
Liu, Zhao, Ma & Bo (2014) define the mind map as an expression that involves reading
the ideas stored in the human mind by crystallizing the main subject and its subbranches and ideas through a series of drawings and lines. These drawings and lines are
used in a new way, attracting the attention of the reader, and serve as a catalyst to help
him retrieve information in the short term. Moreover, mind mapping is an effective way
to generate limitless main ideas and subsets of these each subdivided into subgroups
with sub-ideas and so on (Fiktorius, 2013).
26

Mind mapping is sometimes known as cognitive mapping, cartography,
semantic mapping, and graphic organizing. It is one of the strategies used as a prewriting strategy to enable the writer to plan by visualizing the organization of the text
before and during drafting (Sundeen, 2012). Mind-mapping keywords are placed in a
way that indicates a relationship to the main idea. The branches are developed from the
main idea to allow expanding the concept and visualization of components so that
relationships become visible (Boyle, 1996). Previous studies have clearly demonstrated
that graphic organizers are an effective tool for student's planning during a writing task.
The visual organizer provides a form in which the initial concept is formulated in the
centre of the paper and expanded by physically connecting ideas to each other in a
spiderweb-like pattern (Sundeen, 2012), (Tayib, 2015).
Correspondingly, a mind map consists of a central idea or a theme to which
related ideas are connected by connecting hooks. Subsequent ideas are then linked
together, and a hierarchical map of user ideas related to a particular subject becomes
apparent. The mind map is based on irradiated thinking, a concept that mirrors the
human brain and how it manipulates various ideas and information which are
interconnected by the hooks of the relationship. A variety of applications can be
developed through mind mapping (Arulselvi, 2017).
The preparation of a map of the mind is clear and simple. This aspect helps to
distinguish the mind map from other schemes, because of the ease of use. The
components of a mind map develop in several stages, according to Davies (2011). First,
the writer should place an image or subject in the centre, using at least three colours,
and use images, icons, and dimensions throughout the mind map. Then, he should write
keywords, each on its own line. The writer should then connect the lines starting from
the central image. The central lines are thicker, organic and flowing, becoming thinner
27

as they radiate away from the centre. The writer should make the lines the same length
as image and use color-coding around his mind map.

Additionally, mind mapping is used as a method of memory usage. It relies on
visual memory in an easy-to-read illustration and easy-to-remember diagram that
clearly shows ideas in the form of relationships (Tayib, 2016). Mind maps are one of
the easiest instructional technological methods, having all the characteristics of a
certain natural form which is separated from the central form by lines, symbols, images,
and words, according to a set of simple, basic, natural rules favoured by the mind, and
represents how the human mind thinks, where the words and meanings are linked to
images. The different meanings are linked to each other as branches (Arulselvi, 2017).
28

Finally, Davies (2011) notes that the mind map increases learning efficiency by using
both the left and right brain.
2.4.1 Mind mapping in education
Mind mapping was not originally invented as an educational tool, but it is found
that it has a variety of applications in teaching and learning processes (Brinkmann,
2003). Mind mapping has been popular in the L2 classroom and other areas of education
among teachers and students because of its effectiveness and versatility. This technique
can help its users to brainstorm, organize, generate ideas, memorize and solve
problems. It is also very easy and flexible to use inside and outside the classroom and
there are even free online apps that make it more convenient (Arulselvi, 2017).
Studies have revealed the importance of mind maps in learning and teaching.
Brinkmann (2003) listed several advantages for the use of mind maps in education.
First, mind maps help students connect, organize, memorize and recall information.
They can also be very beneficial in summarizing lessons. They also help teachers
introduce new topics and show connections between concepts and topics. Mind maps
not only help students connect ideas, but they also help them generate more ideas. Some
examples of the use of mind mapping strategy in education are reviewed next.
Mento et al. (1999) studied mind mapping in executive education. The
researchers noticed that executive students did a very comprehensible and clear
presentation by using a transparency of their mind maps instead of note cards. In
addition, they were able to confidently answer questions and recall information easily,
because it was stored in a cohesive manner where associations are made in a nonlinear
way.
Additionally, Goodnough & Long (2002) allowed a sixth-grade science class to
explore mind mapping as a learning tool and found that students could benefit from it
29

to introduce and develop concepts. It could be used to assess learning of individuals
and to give students a greater choice on how to finish projects and assignments.
Brinkmann (2003) reported that Mathematics teachers were very enthusiastic about
using mind mapping as a pedagogical tool to teach Mathematics. Teachers noted that
students who found the subject challenging benefited from mind mapping because they
can realize connections between mathematical concepts while they made their own
maps. because the graphic display helped them organize their knowledge.
Another example is a study by Abi‐El‐Mona & Adb‐El‐Khalick (2008), in
which they tested the effect of mind maps as a learning tool for eighth graders'
achievement in Science class, besides whether mind mapping was facilitated by the
students' prior scholastic achievement. The results were encouraging. The experimental
group’s Science achievement was significantly higher than that of the control group,
and the improvement was not mediated by the students' prior scholastic achievement.
D'Antoni & Pianto Zipp (2005) suggested that teachers and educators could
employ mind maps in many ways. Teachers could use mind maps before class to
introduce concepts from assigned readings to be reviewed during class, or they could
use mind maps to sum up what already had been reviewed at the end of class. Teachers
could also use mind maps in presentations.
Mind mapping was used in different ways inside L2 classrooms. Al-Jarf (2011)
examined the use of mind mapping to improve EFL students' spelling skills. The
researcher used mind map software to help students associate spoken phonemes with
their written forms. The mind mapping software was used to group, categorize, and
classify words according to their sound associations. As Al-Jarf (2011) explains, a mind
map begins with inserting a phonics category at the centre of the screen, which is used
30

as a base for grouping, categorizing and sub-categorizing words with the same
phoneme-grapheme relationship. Branches spreading from the phonic category are
drawn from the sub-categories and examples with the same phoneme-grapheme
relationship. Sub-categories, examples and words are produced from students, grouped
into related phonics sub-categories and radiating out from the central phonics category.
The students used mind mapping to develop related, rather than isolated, knowledge of
phonics. In addition, they developed the skill of differentiating and making associations
between phonemes and graphemes.
Mind mapping as a graphic organizer was also used as a strategy for L2 reading
comprehension. Manoli & Papadopoulou (2012, p.348) asserted that "when [graphic
organizers] are deployed in the various language courses, [they] improve students’
reading comprehension skills and contribute to the acquisition of the target language".
Similarly, Khajavi & Ketabi (2012) conducted a study on 60 second-year
university students enrolled in an English reading comprehension course. The
participants, 21 males and 39 females, ranged in age from nineteen to twenty-three
years. The participants were divided equally into a control and an experimental group.
Prior to the treatment, both groups took a pre-test in reading comprehension and a selfefficacy questionnaire. For ten weeks, the experimental group was trained to use
concept mapping for reading comprehension. At the end of the training, both groups
received the reading comprehension post-test and the self-efficacy questionnaire to
evaluate the influence of the concept mapping program. The results of data analyses
were encouraging, since the experimental group results showed greater improvement
in reading comprehension as well as self-efficacy.

31

In L2 writing, the focus of this thesis, a mind map starts with the topic of the
planned text at the centre of the map. Main ideas can flow out of the topic and are
mainly presented by verbs; further details can also flow out of each main idea. To help
students memorize and associate different vocabulary words needed for the text, verbs,
adjectives and nouns related to each idea can be linked to the vocabulary words, or they
can independently flow out of the main topic. Adding linguistic clues to the map can
help students to first, find appropriate linguistic elements and second, to facilitate the
studying and memorization of those elements.
2.5 Studies on Writing and Mind Mapping
Several studies have addressed the unique relationship between drawing and
writing and their use during the planning phase of children’s writing. A good example
is a study by Norris, Mokhtari & Reichard (1998) which explored the relationship
between drawing and writing. The study revealed significant differences between the
treatment and the control group on all measures used. Students who drew before writing
tended to produce more words, sentences, and idea units and their overall writing
performance and the writing achievement were higher. Additionally, the result showed
that drawing became an effective planning strategy for the students who appeared to
rely on their drawings as a reference point to prompt them toward what should come
next in their writing. Integrating drawing and writing may also be used as a way of
motivating students to write and enjoy doing it.
Using mind maps to organize, generate ideas, and make associations between
different topics through drawing has been investigated to test its effect on writing.
Sundeen (2012) examined the effects of an explicit organizational strategy (mindmapping) on the writing of high school students with learning disabilities. The results
of the study indicated an improvement in the quality of data from a writing pre- and
32

post-test. The participants' interviews suggested that students felt that the use of the
strategy and explicit strategic instructions helped to improve their writing. Their
teachers believe that the strategy has greatly helped them and described improvements
in pre-writing planning.
In particular, mind mapping to teach writing in a foreign language was found to
be useful for both children and adults. Studies such as (Al-Jarf, 2009; Al Naqbi, 2011;
Fiktorius, 2013; Shakoori et al., 2017) show the effect that mind mapping has on both
writing achievement and attitudes. The following section reviews studies that have
addressed the relationship between the study variables.
Fiktorius (2013) explored the integration of mind mapping in the EFL
classroom. As a result of the discussions and review of previous literature, Fiktorius
(2013) concluded that mind mapping is an effective way to take notes and share ideas.
The strategy seems particularly appropriate in helping students plan their writings and
encouraging them to reach a deeper level of understanding of writing topics, suggesting
that mind mapping may affect students in terms of the ability to plan and organize their
ideas for writing assignments under exam conditions. The results also indicated that
mind maps are most valuable when the main objective is to develop a comprehensive
understanding of all basic concepts’ participation in the subject area, and can help to
achieve creativity, organization, productivity, as well as stimulate memory.
Al Naqbi (2011) conducted an investigation to help students in the eleventhgrade move from a product-based approach to a process-type approach to writing, and
to evaluate the use of mind mapping in this context as a pre- brainstorming strategy in
the EFL classroom. Initial results indicate that using mind maps was associated with a
noticeable shift in the writing of students, making them more active learners. As such,
they began to practice different skills, like asking questions to understand writing topics
33

and generating their own ideas for different writing tasks. Moreover, the students
seemed more understanding of the mind map technique and the rationale underlying it.
Shakoori et al. (2017) researched the effect of concept mapping as a graphic tool
in writing achievement among EFL learners. In a semi-experimental design, 28 students
from the Danesh Gostar Foreign Language centre in Tehran, Iran, were selected as a
sample group and divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental
group received instruction through conceptual mapping while the other group practiced
the traditional education model. Results showed that the use of conceptual drawing did
affect writing of the experimental group, leading the authors to conclude that the
mapping method is effective. As concluded by Shakoori et al. (2017) mapping excels
as a graphic tool to represent knowledge that emphasizes the relationships between
concepts, facilitates writing, makes writing practice interesting for EFL learners, and
provides the depth and meaning of learning.
In addition to the studies mentioned, Khudhair (2016) conducted a study to
investigate the impact of mind mapping as a pre-writing tool on the essay writing of
Iraqi EFL college students. In his study, 60 EFL college students were randomly
selected and then divided into an experimental and a control group. First of all,
participants of the two groups were given a pre-test in order to ensure comparability of
their essay writing. Unlike the control group, the experimental group was then trained
to write using mind mapping as a pre-writing strategy. A post-test was administered to
both groups to measure the effect of the intervention. The results showed a significant
difference in writing achievement between the two groups in favour of the experimental
group.
Other studies have also showed that the mind mapping strategy is popular
among students and teachers as a result of its positive impact on writing achievement.
34

Nurlaila (2013) conducted a study on the use of mind the mapping technique in writing
a descriptive text. The results showed a significant improvement in the ability of
students to write after mind mapping. In addition, most of the students gave positive
responses to the mind mapping strategy in writing descriptive texts. In addition, the
researcher conducted interviews with the students which revealed that the students liked
this technique as it motivated them to write descriptive texts in an enjoyable way and
improved their writing. It increased vocabulary and creativity, and it helped them to
arrange sentences and organize ideas. Nurlaila (2013) recommended using the
technique of mind mapping in teaching writing of different types of texts and at levels
of education.
In 2009, Al-Jarf published a study in which he investigated the students'
attitudes towards using mind mapping software to help them with their English writing.
The sample consists of students in their first writing course in EFL who had difficulty
generating ideas in writing paragraphs with topic sentences and supporting details. The
mind mapping program was used to help half of students exchange ideas, generate
ideas, and link key ideas with supporting details. Mind mapping software used lines,
colours, arrows, and branches to show connections between ideas created on the mind
map. The program was used to create mind maps for writing articles every week.
Previous to use of the mind mapping software, there were no differences between the
two groups in their ability to write. After half of the students learned through the
program, post-test results showed that the experimental students who had used mental
mapping programs achieved higher writing gains. Additionally, those students had
positive attitudes towards using the mind mapping software.
The mind mapping strategy also affects the way students perceive writing in
English. Saed & Al-Omari (2014) studied the effectiveness of a mind mapping program
35

to develop writing achievement skills among Jordanian high school students and to
assess the role that mind mapping strategy can play in enhancing student attitudes
towards writing. The results showed statistically significant differences in the mean
scores of students in their academic achievement and their attitudes towards writing, in
favour of the experimental group. In other words, there was no significant difference
between the teaching method and the students level in English (good, middle or poor)
in terms of the students' achievement or attitudes towards writing, indicating that the
mind mapping training had a positive effect on both achievement and attitudes
regardless of students’ overall language level.
Also, Shakoori & Kadivar (2015) conducted a study on concept mapping as a
pre-writing strategy and examined its effect on EFL learners’ writing achievement and
interest. The participants were students from Danesh Gostar Foreign Language center
in Tehran, Iran, ranging from 12 to 18 years old. The results showed that conceptual
drawing was effective in improving the writing of the experimental group and also in
increasing the interest of EFL learners in writing English as a foreign language.
Shakoori & Kadivar (2015) note that the use of effective and practical methods such as
concept mapping can facilitate writing as well as make writing interesting for EFL
learners. It can give depth and meaning to their learning, increase their interest in
writing specifically, and generally motivate them to learn English as a foreign language.
Previously, Zaid (2011) had made a study to assess the impact of multimedia
conceptual mapping and online reading before writing on the quality of students'
compositions and their fear of writing. Results shows that online reading and
multimedia conceptual mapping to be more effective than traditional writing
instruction. In addition, multimedia conceptual mapping was proven to be more
effective than online reading as a pre-writing strategy. Results also indicates that both
36

educational strategies used had a significant impact on improving students' writing.
However, the multimedia conceptual mapping increased students' apprehension. Zaid
(2011) suggested that the increase in fear could be due to the pressure that such
techniques put on the students, especially because students had to use sophisticated and
demanding software to design concept maps.
Similarly, Tayib (2015) conducted a study to determine the effect of using
graphic organizers on students' writing achievement, and to explore the impact of
graphic organisers on students' attitudes towards writing. The sample was first-year
male students at the preparatory college at Umm-Al-Qura University in Makkah, Saudi
Arabia, whose ages ranged from 17 to 19 years. The participants completed a writing
test before and after the treatment as well as an attitude questionnaire. The findings
showed that students’ writing ability had improved and that their attitudes towards
writing in English were positively affected.
Previous studies used mind mapping strategy as a pre-writing strategy to
manage the process of L1 and L2 writing. Mind mapping strategy in these studies is
used to generate and connect ideas and, in some cases, related vocabularies are added.
However, none of them intended to organize grammatical knowledge inside the mind
map.
2.6 Conclusion
Along with reading and comprehension, writing is indispensable. Writing skills
are an indicator of educational achievement and a prerequisite for involvement in public
life and in the international economy. Nevertheless, a large number of school students
are graduating without the required levels of writing skills (Dean, 2010).
As suggested by extant literature, using strategies, especially those that mirror
how the human mind works, can help students have some control over the skills and
37

cognitive processes necessary when writing and thus improve their writing and
attitudes. Mind mapping as an educational strategy is supported by empirical evidence,
as several studies have reported that mind maps helped improve students' L2 writing
achievement and attitudes toward writing. In addition, mind mapping was positively
perceived by students as well as teachers as a tool that can improve students' L2 writing.
However, none of the previous studies on mind maps included grammatical
clues or syntactical structures. Mind maps were only used as a tool to generate and
organize ideas and sub-ideas, although in some cases it included related vocabulary. As
stated by Sturm & Rankin-Erickson (2002), mind mapping helps students write with
more confidence by breaking down the skills and tasks they have to handle during
writing. It also helps them consciously and separately think about different linguistic
aspects of their writing. Motivated by previous studies on the problems facing first-year
female Saudi EFL students, the researcher intends to include syntactical structures and
grammatical clues to the map to help students manage and organize linguistic
knowledge while writing.
To summarize, writing in general, and in L2 writing in particular, is a highly
complex skill as it includes several cognitive processes. This researcher recognizes the
importance of planning in helping writers write more effectively. The researcher finds
it interesting and worthwhile to investigate planning strategies that can enhance
students’ writing such as methods that have the ability to support the cognitive
processes. Mind mapping, as a proposed strategy, supported by theoretical and
empirical evidence, has the potential to be a successful method in enhancing L2 writing.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
The objective of this study is to explore the effect of using the strategy of mind
mapping on the writing achievement and attitudes of a sample of first-year female Saudi
EFL students at Taif University. The target population consists totally of first-year
female EFL students studying at Taif University, all native speakers of Arabic.
The research method and approach, the description of the method, the study
population, the methods and tools used in collection of data, the dependent and
independent variables in the research study are presented. Furthermore, the
implementation of the method, the considerations of the reliability and validity, the
models for the study and statistical methods and finally, the summary, are described in
detail.
3.2 The Study Methodology
This research is quasi-experimental in nature, and also a correlational study
because the effect of using the strategy of mind mapping on the writing achievement
and attitudes towards writing is reported. In addition, this correlational study reflects
cross-sectional research, since it shows the students’ behaviour during a specific period
of time.
A mixed method approach was used to collect and analyse data, check
compatibility results, and integrate results and conclusions. Mixed Method Research
(MMR) is defined as a blend of qualitative and quantitative techniques generated by
the researcher or by a research team and aims to obtain depth along with the width of
realization or confirmation with a high level of support within a single study or directly
related studies (Creswell and Clark, 2011).
39

According to Creswell (2008), mixed methods research is a specialized form of
study that combines quantitative and qualitative data to observe, analyse and integrate.
Furthermore, the mixed method approach is a practical approach by which the
researcher gathers data via both quantitative followed by qualitative techniques or vice
versa, or even simultaneously (Creswell and Clark, 2011). Thus, the method that was
used by the researcher involved firstly an experiment with a quasi-experimental design
to gather the quantitative data, followed by interviews to gather the qualitative data.
If the researcher collects data through a quantitative approach (quasiexperimental design) and follows this up by conducting interviews with the people
included in the sample who participated in the experiment to discuss the experimental
results in greater depth, the findings will be more useful and will generate added value
(Creswell and Clark 2011).
Thus, a mix between quantitative and qualitative approaches was utilized in this
study to generate more in-depth and accurate information on the research topic. The
survey was distributed to the sample of 128 first-year female EFL students at Taif
University, and the interviews were conducted with a sample of 10 female students
from the experimental group after completing the post-test and after answering the
questionnaire.
3.3 Description of Methodology
This study was undertaken in three phases: The pre-experimental phase, which
took place during the first week, the experimental phase, which started in the 2nd week
and ended on the 10th week, and the post-experimental phase, which took place during
the 11th week. It was performed during the first semester of the academic year

40

2017/2018. The study lasted for eleven weeks, considering that mid-term exams week
was excluded.

As Table 3.1 shows, each phase is characterized by its situation: in the preexperimental phase (week one) the control group received the writing achievement pretest and answered the writing attitudes questionnaire; in the experimental phase (weeks
two to ten), the control group received traditional writing instructions. Finally, in the
post-experimental phase (week eleven), the control group took the writing achievement
post-test and answered the writing attitudes questionnaire.
Likewise, in the pre-experimental phase (week one) the experimental group was
tested by the writing achievement pre-test and answered the writing attitudes
41

questionnaire. In the experimental phase (weeks two to ten), the experimental group
received mind mapping writing sessions. Finally, in the post-experimental phase (week
eleven), the experimental group completed the writing achievement post-test and
answered the writing attitudes questionnaire. The reason behind conducting a post-test
was to assess and compare progress and achievements of students in each group to
evaluate the impact of the mind mapping sessions.
All this is followed by interviews with ten students, chosen at random, who
formed the focus group drawn from the experimental group, to enhance the results by
obtaining more in-depth data from students regarding their writing problems, strategy
use and their attitudes towards the strategy of mind mapping.
In conclusion, a Mixed Methods Approach was used to address the study
research questions. The methodology design was quasi-experimental and consisted of
setting up two groups: control, and experimental. Pre-tests and post-tests were used
beside quasi-experimental methods.
3.4 Study Population
Female first-year EFL students from the College of Science at Taif University
are targeted for the study sample. All are native speakers of Arabic and had received
formal English language instruction for at least six years before starting university. The
students live in Taif or the surrounding towns and villages and are between 18 to 23
years old.
3.5 Pilot Study
Prior to the planned study, a pilot study was conducted, with the objective of
calculating psychometric characteristics of scales and checking the validity and
reliability of the questionnaire and the writing achievement test. The pilot study sample
42

included 42 female students from the College of Science, more specifically the Biology
department, whose ages ranged from 18-24 years, mean was 18.929. The standard
deviation was (1.369) years, and their academic level 1.
3.6 Study Sample
The study sample comprised 128 students whose ages ranged from 18-23 years
at the time of the study, registered in the first-year EFL course at Taif University. The
sample was divided into two groups: the control group consisted of 71 students, and the
experimental group included 57 students. In the control group, the students received
traditional writing instructions. In the experimental group, the students were taught
through a program of mind mapping writing sessions.
A total of 128 female first-year EFL students at Taif University participated in
the study. They were chosen at random from the first-year cohort of the university. The
students’ ages ranged from 18-23 years M=18.652, SD=.812. They were divided into
two groups: the experimental group, 57 students, whose age ranged from 18-23 years,
M=18.474, SD=0.710, and the control group 71 students, whose age was between 1823, M= 18.662 SD=0.926.
3.7 Study Variables
The independent variable for the current study was the teaching method used
to teach writing. This variable has two levels:
1. Traditional method.
2. Mind mapping program
The dependent variables for the current study were:
1. Writing achievement
2. Students' attitudes towards writing
43

These variables were measured before and after the treatment by using pre and post
writing achievement tests as well as pre and post writing attitudes questionnaires.
3.8 Study Instruments
Data were collected using a mixed methods approach from two main sources.
The primary data was ccollected via questionnaires, interviews and the writing
achievement tests. Detailed descriptions of the tools are provided in 3.8.1, 3.8.2 and
3.8.3, including the terms of their contents, justifications for their choices, and further
details.
3.8.1 The writing attitudes questionnaire
A writing attitudes questionnaire was adapted from Sturm (1996) for the
purpose of studying students' attitudes towards writing before and after the treatment.
The researcher added seven additional statements to serve the purpose of the current
study. This attitude questionnaire addressed the constructs of enjoyment (6 items), ease
(6 items), competence/ability (7 items), and strategy used to write (6 items) (see
Appendix A). The total was 25 Likert-scale items. Choices on the scale ranged from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
3.8.1.1 Development and use of the writing attitudes questionnaire
The main goal of using this writing attitudes questionnaire adapted from Sturm
(1996) was to investigate the students' attitudes towards writing in English before and
after the treatment. Appropriate statements were drawn from and added to Sturm’s
(1996) questionnaire, paraphrased and modified to suit this study. The researcher then
presented this questionnaire to her research supervisor at the university, and to some
academic instructors working at Taif University, who provided valued notes and
recommended some alterations.

At this stage, the questionnaire consisted of 25
44

statements spread over 4 dimensions. These were reduced to 23 items after the pilot
study (see Appendix A). In order to preserve validity, the questionnaire was then
translated into Arabic by the researcher, because all sample students are native speakers
of Arabic who might not understand the questionnaire details in English.
Then, the Arabic version of the questionnaire was again presented to several translationcertified instructors from the English Language Centre for their views concerning the
suitability of the translation, its clarity, the correlation of each question with respect to
the questionnaire dimensions and the accuracy of the Arabic grammatical phrasing of
the questions. To increase the credibility of the study instrument, it was revised through
various steps.
The first step was the translation of the questionnaire from English to Arabic.
After the translation, it was revised by an Arabic language editor in order to improve
its language. Then, a professional colleague, a native speaker of English with Arabic as
a second language, was asked to re-translate the questionnaire (Arabic to English). This
was done to allow a comparison of the Arabic version with the original English version
of the questionnaire, in order to check for differences in terms of translation and to
produce the final edition of the questionnaire before the distribution. Thus, the
questionnaire passed through three stages of translation and revision (English-ArabicEnglish), for both Arabic and English versions. The participants were asked to respond
to each item by ticking the appropriate response from five choices. The reliability of
the questionnaire was confirmed, and Cronbach’s alpha was used to check the
consistency of the results produced by the scale. According to Sekaran (2004), the
values of Cronbach’s Alpha for each variable of the questionnaire and for the entire
questionnaire should exceed 0.60 in order to consider the result acceptable.

45

1.Content validity of students` writing attitudes.
For content validity, the measurement was presented to five experts from the
English Language Centre and Foreign Language Department to verify that each item
belonged to its dimension, and to correct it if adjustment was required.
2. Construction validity of students` writing attitudes.
The researcher used the item-total correlation by Pearson correlation coefficient
as in the following Table 3.2.

3. Validity and reliability of students` writing attitudes questionnaire.
The researcher calculated the reliability using two methods, Cronbach’s Alpha and
Split-half (Spearman-Brown) as shown in the following Table 3.3.

dimensions methods, Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients ranged from 0.714 to 0.824, and
Split-half coefficients ranged from 0.826 - 0.882, both high.

A writing achievement test was prepared by the researcher and a rubric was used
to assess the students' writing. The writing achievement test was administered to
determine students' writing achievement before and after the treatment. The pre-test
was administered at the start to both the control and experimental groups. The post-test
was used to assess the progress of both groups at the end of the writing sessions. In
other words, the test was administered twice to both groups, first during the preexperimental phase during the first week, and secondly during the post-experimental

47

phase in the eighth week. The duration allotted for both tests was 45 minutes. Students
were not allowed to use dictionaries during either exams.
Consequently, the following points were checked in advance, as this test would
be used with the study research participants (see Appendix B):
•

The appropriateness and relevance of the questions to the goals of the course.

•

The appropriateness and relevance of the questions to the purposes of the
course.

•

The linguistic clarity of the questions.

•

Verification that the items measured what they purported to measure.
The importance of the writing achievement test is summarized by its role as the

main evaluation of students’ achievement and their progress. Therefore, to determine
the validity of the writing test, the researcher calculated the following
1. Content validity of the writing achievement test
The test was submitted to five university teachers who are specialists in English,
for their opinions on the subject of writing and helping words. Then the researcher made
adjustments to the test and its instructions according to their observations and
suggestions.
2. Reliability of the writing achievement test
The researcher used the inter-rater reliability method. For the pilot study, the
researcher corrected students' exam papers without writing the score on the test papers,
then asked her colleagues to correct the same papers of the pilot sample. The Pearson
correlation coefficient of measurement reliability of the test was 0.807, while it is
significant at 0.001. This means the test that was used for this study has high reliability.

48

3.8.3 Interviews
The researcher chose to interview students to determine their views and
sensitivities regarding their writing difficulties and the writing strategies that were used,
in addition to a question about whether they think mind mapping helped them with
writing in English. The interviews took place after the experimental group’s post-test,
to elicit the students’ attitudes towards writing in English and their usage of writing
strategies.
Interviews were conducted on a focus group of 10 students selected from the
experimental group. Five students were selected for being the highest achievers and
five for being the lowest achievers. Face-to-face interviews (interviews with each
student separately) were conducted in a suitable and quiet location at the university,
each lasting for approximately twenty minutes. Some students refused to allow
recording of the interview, so the researcher took notes. The questions were:
1. What difficulties do you face to write in English?
2. What strategies do you use to overcome these difficulties?
3. Does mind mapping help you to write in English? How?
3.8.3.1 Interview analyses
The interview answers were read, analysed and coded. Responses were
classified, according to what the code described. Each code covered several sub codes
as follows.

3.9 The Mind Mapping Program
A total of 128 female Saudi learners of English as a foreign language
participated in an 11-week study with a pre-test,post-test program. During the first week
the writing achievement test and the writing attitudes questionnaire were administered
to both groups. However, in the first week, during the first welcoming session, the
experimental group watched a Power Point presentation on mind mapping strategy and
its uses and benefits that the control group did not view. From week 2 to week 10, all
students had writing sessions on the following topics.
Talk about yourself/father/mother/friend, my house, my family, my street, my favorite
restaurant, likes and dislikes, things you usually do on the weekend, how you spend
your free time, sleeping habits, clothes and colors you like, my daily routine, things

50

students can do at the university, last weekend, last holiday, a city you visited recently,
my life now and then, my grandfather's life, life in Saudi Arabia before oil.
In each of the one- hour sessions (with a total of 18 sessions), the participants
received different pre-writing instructions. The experimental group, consisting of 57
students, practiced using mind maps to plan their writings, whereas the control group
of 71 students worked according to the traditional writing teaching methods. The
researcher taught both groups who were enrolled in an English1 course for six hours
per week, meant for beginner-level students. Two of the six hours a week were
dedicated to writing sessions for both groups. However, during the sessions of the
experimental group, while the teacher used coloured whiteboard markers to draw a
sample mind map on the board, the students used crayons and blank A4 sized papers to
draw their own mind maps in order to plan their writing.
Since the students of both groups were considered beginners, they were only
expected to write simple paragraphs using simple sentences. The researcher had noticed
from previous experience and from the pre-test writing achievement test that the
students struggled even on the sentence-writing level.
Consequently, the mind mapping writing sessions for the experimental group
were designed as follows. First, the teacher introduced the topic to the students before
reviewing related vocabulary that had been introduced in previous lectures. Then,
students were asked to draw a theme picture representing the topic at the centre of the
blank A4 page. After that, students were instructed to think about related ideas,
reflecting on the appropriate tense to be used. On the sheet, each idea was represented
by a verb branching out from the main theme. The students then decided the subject
(nouns, noun phrases, pronouns) of each sentence and added those in front of the verb
already written on the sheet. The students then added several possible details branching
51

out from each verb (nouns, noun phrases, adjectives, prepositional phrases). Each main
branch was drawn in a different colour. Images, symbols and emojis could be added to
the map, as shown in figure 3.1.

Figure 3. 1: A sample of students' hand drawn mind maps

After the map was ready, each branch of the map would represent a path which,
if followed by students, would help them construct a full simple sentence. Connecting
words such as “and” and “but” would interconnect the branches, if needed. Then the
students logically numbered their sentences. Students were then able to write their first
drafts, following their map. Students could add adverbs, adjectives in their proper
positions to further enrich their sentences. Students then revised their writing to check
their grammar, vocabulary, spelling, punctuation and coherence. Finally, students wrote
52

the final text. Using this process, and depending on the topic, one map could be a part
of another map. For example, a short paragraph about "my father" could be a part of a
longer paragraph talking about "my family,"
3.10 Conclusion
To summarize, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of using
mind mapping strategy on first year EFL students' writing achievement and their
attitudes towards writing in English. In order to achieve the aims, the researcher
adopted a quasi-experimental design to test the effect of using the independent variable
(teaching method) on the dependent variables, i.e. writing achievement and attitudes
towards writing. The researcher also investigated difficulties faced by students and
strategies they use to overcome them. In addition, their views on the effectiveness of
mind mapping on their English writing were investigated. In order to collect data, the
researcher administered pre- and post- writing achievement tests, pre- and postquestionnaires on writing attitudes, and interviewed participants in a focal group. A
pilot study was done prior to the study to confirm the validity and reliability of the study
instruments.

4.2.1.1 Research question 1
To answer research question 1, are there any significant differences between the
mean scores of the experimental group and the control group on the post-tests of the
students` writing attitudes and writing achievement? Hypothesis 1 (H1) is that there are
significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the
control group on the writing achievement post-tests of the first-year female Saudi EFL
students and their attitudes toward writing in favor of the experimental group. The
corresponding null hypothesis is that there are no differences between the experimental
and control groups on the post-test. To test this hypothesis the researcher performed an
independent sample t-test, as reported in Table 4.2.

Thus, the researcher accepts H1 and rejects the null hypothesis. The scores show also
that the content of each session was suitable for the learners' level.

4.2.1.2 Research question 2
To answer research question 2, are there any significant differences between the
mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement for
the experimental group? Hypothesis2 (H2) says that there exists significant differences
between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of the first-year female Saudi EFL

57

students` writing achievement and attitudes towards writing, who have received mind
mapping training, in favour of the post-tests. The corresponding null hypothesis is that
there are no significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group
when the pre-test and post-tests are compared. To test this hypothesis, the researcher
used a paired sample t-test, as illustrated in Table 4.3.

the researcher accepts H2 and rejects the null hypothesis for this question. This means
that the mind mapping training was effective with the students and the content of each
session was suitable for the learners' level. The following figure illustrates these values.

4.2.2. Qualitative data
In order to answer the third, fourth and fifth research questions, qualitative data
from interviews were collected. A focus group consisting of ten students equally
divided into high and low achievers was interviewed.
The researcher interviewed five high achievers from the experimental group.
The students were named HS1, HS2 …(HS5). The researcher also interviewed five low
achievers from the experimental group. The students were named (LS1), (LS2)
…(LS5). The following is an overview of the students' answers and study findings using
data from the interview.

4.2.2.1. Research question 3
In order to answer study question 3, what are the difficulties that the students
face in writing in English? Hypothesis 3 (H3) states that Saudi first-year EFL students
face difficulties writing in English on the sentence level. The corresponding null
hypothesis is that they do not face difficulties writing sentences in English. To test (H3)
the students were asked "What difficulties do you face while writing in English?" The
high achievers' group’s answers fell in to three categories: organization, vocabulary and
spelling. The students’ main concern was about spelling (four out of five students) and
two out of five students said that they had problems related to vocabulary. Student
(HS1) said "I first think about the vocabulary that I know is right, then I write a
sentence". Two out of the five students were concerned about organization. For
example, student (HS5) said, "it is hard for me to organize my ideas". However, student
(HS4) said that she did not have any problems in writing because she had "time to think
about the sentences before writing".

60

On the other hand, low achievers' answers were classified into five categories:
vocabulary, grammar, organization, ideas and spelling. The majority of the low
achievers group (four out five) said that one of the difficulties was related to grammar.
For example, student (LS3) said, "It was hard for me to write a correct sentence. I was
confused about the sentence structure." Three out of five students struggled with
having enough vocabulary. Student (LS5) said, "Sometimes I am confused about
choosing the right verb.” In addition, three out of five students had problems in
spelling. (LS2) said, "It is easy for me to read but it is hard for me to write, maybe
because of spelling." Organization and ideas were the two least problematic issues of
students, with only one student reporting each.
The students' answers assert that students face difficulties in writing in English
related to grammar, vocabulary and spelling in addition to ideas and organization. Thus,
the researcher accepts H3 and rejects the null hypothesis for this question.
4.2.2.2. Research question 4
To answer study question 4, which writing strategies do students use to
overcome writing problems? Hypothesis 4 (H4) says that students do not use pre-writing
strategies to plan their writing. The corresponding null hypothesis is that they use prewriting strategies to plan their writing. To test H4 the researcher asked the students
"What strategies do you use to overcome these difficulties?" The answers were limited
to memorization, practice and self-correction. Most high achievers said that they used
methods related to memorization, except for one (HS1) who said, "actually I did
nothing. I felt like I can express myself, so I did nothing". However, all students
mentioned that they memorize words for meaning and spelling, but not that they
memorize sentences or paragraphs for the exams. For example, student (HS3) said, "I
make a list of words and memorize it". Three out of five students said that they just
61

practice. Student (HS2), who also was the only one who used self-correction, said, "I
write, and I use websites to correct my writing".
On the other hand, low achievers' answers were limited to two categories:
memorisation and mimicry. All students relied on strategies related to memorization.
Student (LS5) answered the question by saying, "Honestly, I just memorize". Student
(LS4) who also is the only student who used mimicry said, "I mimic the paragraphs
written in the book and then memorize them for the exam."
Students answers regarding writing strategies show that they use strategies only
to pass the exam and that they do not have clear understanding of writing strategies.
The answers most importantly show that they do not plan their writings which confirms
hypothesis 4. Therefore, the researcher accepts H4 and rejects the null hypothesis for
this question.
4.2.2.3. Research question 5
To answer study question 5, do students think that mind mapping helped them
write better and how? Hypothesis 5 (H5) states that students think that using mind
mapping helped them write better. The corresponding null hypothesis is that they do
not think it helped them. To test H5 the researcher asked the third interview question
"Did the use of mind maps help you write in English? How? Three out of five high
achievers students answered affirmatively for the first part of the question except for
students (HS1) and (HS2) who said, "I do not need to waste time on it. Instead I can
organize it in my head and then write.” Student (HS2) said, "I taught my young cousin
to use it to write in English and she really liked it". She also mentioned that, "if the map
includes only ideas it can help me organize my ideas, because I do not need it for
grammar." The other three students' answers fell into two categories: organization and

62

grammar. For example, student (HS5) thought that the strategy helped her "use the
correct form of the verb and organize ideas".
As for low achievers group, all students answered yes to the first part of the
question. For answering the question, "how mind mapping helped you?", students'
answers were within three categories: organization, vocabulary and grammar. As for
grammar, all students thought that mind mapping strategy helped them with sentence
structure, as (LS2) mentioned, "It was useful for me because I was not good at
constructing sentences." As mentioned by two students, mind mapping also helped
them with vocabulary, as stated by (LS5), "when I think about an idea, it is easier to
think of the appropriate verb and then make a sentence.” Only one student thought that
mind mapping helped her with the organization of ideas. Student (LS4) said, "it wasn't
easy for me to organize my ideas.”
Answers show that students generally think that mind mapping helped them
write better in English. Students expressed that it helped in vocabulary, grammar as
well as organization. Accordingly, the researcher accepts H5 and rejects the null
hypothesis for this question.
4.3 Conclusion
The aim of the current study is to test the effect of using mind mapping strategy
on female EFL students' writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing. The
researcher also investigates some of the difficulties faced by students during writing
and strategies they use to overcome them. In addition, the researcher questioned if
student think that mind mapping strategy helped them write better in English. The
findings of the current study were the following.

63

1. There exists differences between the mean scores of the experimental and the
control group on the post-tests of the students' writing achievement and writing
attitudes, in favor of the experimental group.
2. There exists significant differences between the mean scores of the
experimental group pre- and post-tests in writing achievement and writing attitudes, in
favor of the post-test.
3. The students' answers indicate that their difficulties to write in English
include lack of vocabulary, organization, spelling and grammar.
4. The students' answers indicate that they are accustomed to memorizing,
practicing, and self-correcting, which indicates they are not used to planning their
writing.
5. In general, the students positively perceived the strategy of mind mapping
and thought it helped them in aspects like grammar, vocabular and organization. Mind
mapping eventually helped them write in English.

CHAPTER FIVE - DISCUSSION
5.1 Introduction
This thesis was undertaken to explore the effect of using a mind mapping
strategy to enhance Saudi female EFL students' writing skills and improve their
attitudes towards writing in English. The control and experimental groups were both
tested for writing achievement and surveyed in order to determine their attitudes
towards writing. The experimental group received instruction with mind mapping,
whereas the control group received traditional instruction without mind mapping. The
data were analyzed quantitatively. Data were also collected from a focus group
consisting of ten students from the experimental group by interview and the data from
the interviews were analyzed qualitatively.
Results from the present study might contribute to extend research in the area
of strategy use to teach EFL writing in general, and in the context of Saudi Arabia in
particular. The findings canalso give some insight on the applicability and usefulness
of using mind mapping to teach different skills inside the EFL classroom in general,
and specifically, writing skills. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the findings and
conclusions drawn from this study with reference to the research questions. In addition,
recommendations for future research and possible implications are discussed in this
chapter.
5.2 Discussion of Findings
5.2.1 The strategy of mind mapping and writing achievement
The findings of the current study show that using the strategy of mind mapping
is closely associated with statistically significant positive influence on students’ writing
achievement. Texts were scored for grammar, vocabulary, task fulfilment and
65

coherence. The findings support the findings of Zaid (2011), Khudhair (2016), and
Shakoori et al. (2017), who found that using mind mapping strategy as a prewriting
strategy can enhance the writing achievement of EFL students. The positive impact on
writing achievement may be due to the ability of mind maps to support knowledge
acquisition and retrieval through the aid of visual clues such as colors, lines and images
(Khudhair, 2016).
The researcher also noted that some students used the mind mapping strategy
during the midterm and final exams to plan their writings. Student (LS1) expressed that
during her interview. Verification of that is mentioned in the conclusion of Khudhair
(2016), that mind mapping helps students plan their writing under exam conditions, and
not only help them remember, but most importantly help them compose during writing
exams.
The researcher believes that the mind mapping strategy can help students,
especially beginners, manage different processes while writing. Sturm & RankinErickson (2002) also asserts that mind maps can help students break down writing tasks
and deal with the sub-processes and writing skills more explicitly. A writing mind map,
as was designed in this study, has the ability to help students organize and clearly think
about different aspects while writing independently. It helps them not only manage
information related to the topic, but in addition, it can help them manage linguistic
information to help them with problems as fundamental as sentence structure.
5.2.2 The strategy of mind mapping and writing attitudes
The findings of the study show that mind mapping strategy has significantly
improved the students' attitudes towards writing in English in terms of ease, enjoyment,
competence and strategy use. These findings support some previous studies on the same
subject. Studies by Saed & AL-Omari (2014), Tayib (2015), and Shakoori & Kadivar
66

(2015) containes confirmation on the positive effect mind mapping has on students'
attitudes towards writing in English. The authors mentioned above investigate students'
attitudes in terms of ease, enjoyment, competence and general interest towards writing
in English. Tayib (2015) states that students are more motivated to write in English
since they view it as an easier, more fun task after learning to use graphic organizers.
It should be noted, however, that a study by Zaid (2011) reports that mind mapping has
a negative impact on students' attitudes towards writing because it increases students'
apprehension. These findings contrast with those of Al Asmari (2013), who reports
lower apprehension with strategy use. Zaid (2011) explains his findings by assuming
that students find it stressful because they have to deal with sophisticated software to
design mind maps for their writings. Furthermore, while Zaid (2011) investigates
attitudes by measuring apprehension, the current and previous studies such as (Sakoori
& Kadivar, 2015), (Tayib, 2015) and (Saed & AL-Omari, 2014) studies attitudes in
terms of ease, enjoyment, competence, strategy use and general interest in the writing
task.
5.2.3 Students’ writing problems
Data collected from interviews showed that most high achievers from the focus
group had problems related to ideas and organization. On the other hand, interviews
done with the low achievers revealed that they had more concerns about the
grammatical aspects of the writing task. These findings support the conclusions of
several studies including those of Zamel (1983) and Jones (1982), in that skilled writers
mainly focus and make adjustments to ideas while poor writers are mostly concerned
about making adjustments related to form. However, these findings contrast with the
findings of Jones (1982), who found that poor writers mainly struggle with composing
itself not with grammar and their linguistic competence. Nevertheless, from the
67

researcher's experience, students usually do very well on objective questions related to
grammar and vocabulary, yet they fail to apply grammar and vocabulary in writing
tasks, implying that students might be overwhelmed by the amount of information
processing they have to simultaneously manage while writing. These observations
agree with the conclusions in Raimes’ (1985) study on unskilled writers, where he
concludes that there is no relation between the students' linguistic proficiency and their
writing proficiency, and hence, that writing is not simply a reflection of students'
linguistic competence.
5.2.4 Students’ writing strategies
Data from the interviews show that all low achievers, from the focus group,
memorized whole paragraphs when studying for writing. One low achiever reports in
her interview, that she mimics writings from the course textbook. On the other hand,
high achievers mentioned methods related to practicing, self-correction as well as
memorization of vocabulary and spelling. From the students’ answers, it is clear that
they do not have an understanding of the meaning of writing strategies. This confirms
Alnofal’s (2003) conclusion that Saudi students, in general, lack knowledge of how to
approach writing in both their native and their second language. Their main focus is on
the formal aspects of writing, such as grammar, spelling, and vocabulary.
5.2.5 Students' attitudes towards the strategy of mind mapping
Students' interviews regarding their feelings towards the mind mapping strategy
show that most students like it and thought that it helps them to organize their ideas,
decide on the appropriate tense and write well-structured sentences. Some studies, such
as those by Al-Jarf (2009) and Nurlaila (2013), had also found that using mind mapping,
whether drawn by hand or using software, was positively perceived by students. The
reason students liked it, according to Nurlaila (2013), is that it helped motivate them by
68

making writing more enjoyable. Al-Jarf (2009) noted that students liked mind mapping
because it helped them to visualize the structure of their writing as well as to make
meaningful relationships between ideas.
It should not be overlooked, however, that two students, (HS1) and (HS2) from
the high achievers focus group, conveyed that they did not like using mind mapping
before writing. First, they believe that they do not need it, and second, they feel it is a
waste of time, as was mentioned by (HS1) "I do not need to waste time on it, instead I
can organize it in my head and then write". Nevertheless, student (HS2) indicated that
she had been teaching her younger cousin to use it to write in English. She mentioned
that the cousin liked it very much, and that it had really improved her cousin's writing.
A possible reason is that higher-level students find mind maps as used in this study too
detailed for them, and that they do not need to think about these details while writing.
In other words, high achievers may be able to do the organizing in their heads, and that
ability is what causes them to be high achievers in the first place.
5.3 Pedagogical Implications of the Study
This study emphasizes the importance of implementing specific strategic
writing instruction in EFL classrooms, by confirming that, instead of teaching the
students what to write, teaching them how to write had positive effect on their writing
achievement and their attitudes towards writing. The positive effect could be because
students using the mind mapping strategy have more control over the process of writing.
The study also confirms the applicability and likability for the strategy of mind
mapping in the EFL classroom, to teach different skills in general, and writing skills in
particular. Because of mind mapping’s ability to display words, pictures, along with
associations, it can help students process, store, and recall information. The mind
mapping strategy allows students to break down writing tasks and enables them to make
69

decisions, both consciously and unconsciously, regarding each aspect of the writing
task. In addition, the strategy was positively perceived by teachers and students as being
fun, creative way to teach and to learn writing. Besides, it is an easy, affordable strategy
that does not need many resources to be implemented in EFL classes.
5.4 Suggestion for Future Research
Further research on the effect of using the mind mapping strategy to teach the
specific skills of vocabulary, grammar and reading would enrich current literature and
give more precise uses for the strategy. Additionally, while this study is limited to the
use of the strategy of mind mapping with beginner EFL students, research is needed
into its applicability with non-EFL students such as those majoring in English as well
as with EFL at different learning levels, to include secondary school.
Because this study is limited to female EFL students, there is room for research
into gender differences in Saudi Arabia and other contexts. Finally, the relationship
between learning styles and the strategy of mind mapping can be investigated to
determine if its success is limited to visual learners.
5.5 Conclusion
This researcher has reported on the use of mind mapping as a pre-writing
strategy and its impact on the writing achievement of first-year female EFL students at
Taif university, as well as on its effect on their attitudes towards writing. Findings show
that mind mapping has a significant positive effect on the students' writing achievement
as well as their attitudes towards writing in English. Conclusions of this particular study
emphasize the usefulness of integrating grammatical clues along with syntactical
associations within the mind maps, to help low-level learners apply grammatical rules
while writing.

70

Furthermore, the study shed some light on the problems faced by EFL students
at Taif University. The results show that while high achievers suffer from problems
related to ideas and organization, low achievers are more concerned about form at the
sentence level. The interviews with students from the focus group selected from the
experimental group, also reveal that students have misconceptions regarding the
meaning of writing strategies.
Overall, the findings reveal that the strategy of mind mapping is positively
perceived by students and especially by lower-level students. Students participating in
this study find it to be a very helpful tool in writing. They find it helpful because it helps
them organize ideas, gather vocabulary and apply grammatical rules.
