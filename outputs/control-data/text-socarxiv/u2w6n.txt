Abstract
Smart technology – in its many facets – is often critiqued within Geography in ways that parallel
the critiques of quantitative geography in the 1960s and GIScience in the 1990s. In this way,
both the development on ‘smart’ technology itself and its criticisms are the latest chapter in a
long-standing disciplinary debate around quantification and technology. We re-evaluate this
history and argue that quantitative methodology and its theoretical critiques are not as
incompatible as often claimed.
To illustrate how we might address this apparent tension between theory and quantitative
methods we review how both approaches conceptualize one of Geography’s core concepts:
space, and highlight opportunities for symbiosis. Although smart technologies can further
orthodox positivist approaches, we argue that the actual practice is more nuanced and not
necessarily absolute or totalizing. For example, recent computational work builds upon critical
geographic theories to analyze and visualize topological and relational spaces, relevant to topics
such as gentrification and segregation. The result is not a Geography in which smart technology
and algorithms remove the need for human input but rather a rejoinder in line with the recent
resurgence of a critical quantitative geography. In short, a Geography where social theory and
the human intellect play a key role in guiding computational approaches to analyze the largest,
most versatile and relevant datasets on social space that we have ever had.

Opportunities of smart technologies
It has been a decade since Chris Anderson published his polemic Wired article on big data and
the subsequent “end of theory” (Anderson 2008). In the intermediate years, our discipline has
written extensively on the theoretical, methodological and practical implications of a broad
range of new technologies (using interconnected monikers varying from geoweb and VGI to big
data, and in this issue, labeling such technology as ‘smart’), perhaps even heralding in a ‘digital
turn’ within the discipline (Ash, Kitchin, and Leszczynski 2018). Much attention has been paid to
the socio-spatial implications of digital technology on our everyday lives (e.g. Kitchin and Dodge
2011) and, in the context of smart specifically, the effect on urban governance (Leszczynski
2016; Shelton, Zook, and Wiig 2015). Building on this foundation, we focus instead on the
methodological implications of smart technology for Geography. This too has received ample
attention recently and is sometimes labeled a new ‘quantitative revolution’ (Wyly 2014) – one
that is not necessarily welcomed by all. These quantitative approaches, reinvigorated by access
to new computing technology and datasets, have been critiqued from (social) theory in similar
ways as GIScience in the 1990s and the earlier onset of spatial science in 1960s. Thus, both the
current ‘smart’ technology itself and the critiques leveled against it are but the latest chapter in
a long-standing disciplinary debate around quantification and technology.
Using one of Geography’s core concepts – space – and drawing from the spatial science turn of
the 1960s, we highlight the significant potential for synthesis and symbiosis between
quantitative methodology and geographical theory. In short, we argue that while new
technologies might further an orthodox positivist ontology and epistemology, they also can
enable the analysis of the rich, intricate fabric of space in myriad ways that are quantitative, but
are not necessarily absolute or totalizing. In particular, we seek to connect the ways the
quantitative movement of the 1960s theorized space – including acknowledging the limitations
of an Euclidian approach (Bunge, 1966; Harvey, 1969) – with the social theories used in
theoretical geography today.
Geography as a discipline is at a unique moment in its relationship with ‘smart’ technologies.
We use the ‘smart’ label here as an umbrella term to indicate the onset of new computational
technologies enabling every larger, faster, more exhaustive and varied datasets about social life
to be created and collected (‘big data’, cf. Kitchin and McArdle (2016)) as well as the associated
technologies (e.g. cloud computing; machine learning, etc.) allowing for the analysis of such
data (Leszczynski 2016; Shelton, Zook, and Wiig 2015). If Geography chooses to engage with
smart technologies, it is essential that it is not constrained to just extending existing Geographic
Information Systems, city dashboards, or sophisticated governance control rooms. Nor should
we simply let software giants like ESRI and IBM push geographic software development. While
creating useful tools, they are ultimately responding to market demands, not the pursuit of

2

science. Moreover, we should not take a backseat to other disciplines entering the ‘smart’
arena: physics, computer science and complexity science all have important contributions to
make but are coming from significantly different perspectives than Geography. Rather, we
should learn from our experience with the spatial science turn to leverage the onset of smart
technologies into opportunities to build a tighter integration between geographic theory and
quantitative methodology.
Evolving theories of space
Traditionally, space was treated as a container or geometric system holding the object(s) under
study and allowed users to lay an abstract plane over the Earth’s surface. In most cases this
abstract plane is simply a two-dimensional Euclidean (or, after the 17th century, Cartesian)
space with x- and y-axes useful for describing location. Examples range from Ptolemaios (AD 90
– 168) pinpointing all then-known places within his atlas, Geographia, or the regional
geography of the pre-war era (e.g. Hartshorne 1939) that tasked itself with locating cities,
countries and people. Importantly, objects within such a space are generally considered to be
completely independent of each other. Their only relationship is defined through measuring
their distance to other objects.
In the second half of the 20th century, geographers — and social scientists in general —
critiqued this conceptualization of space as hampering the actual understanding of social (and
spatial) processes. For example, Merleau-Ponty’s (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 2012)
phenomenological analysis of space (forbearing the sub-discipline of humanistic geography)
argues for a primordial situated space that is neither object nor subject or a space where
people and things are no longer independent of each other. Likewise, Lefebvre’s well-known
argument completely breaks away from the notion of space as a container, asserting explicitly
that space is socially produced and non-Euclidean (Lefebvre 1991). Moreover, space as a
product is never final but rather produced, consumed and reproduced in a never-ending and
iterative process. As such, space cannot simply be thought of as something finished – a static
object of study. To understand space, we must study the process of space.
In this way, Geography has moved far from the Euclidean conceptualization of space as a simple
container and instead engages with space that is produced and reproduced in a continuous
fashion. This production of space is messy – consisting of many interconnected and
contradictory layers of everyday social life – such as emblemized by Massey’s (1994) walk
through Kilburn in which she argues that places do not just have one singular identity, or one
sense of place. More recently, geography has seen a renewed interest in a relational
understanding of space (Boggs and Rantisi 2003; Jones 2009) which foregrounds actors (or

3

actants) within space and how their relationships continuously make and remake space
(Brenner, Madden, and Wachsmuth 2011).
Continued reliance upon Euclidean spatial ontologies
This review highlights the complexity of the social theories of space used by Geographers and
yet, we must also note the continued reliance upon a Euclidean definition of space within
quantitative research. Making this dependence even more remarkable are the convincing
critiques of its problematic nature. First, space as an absolute container enables a reductionist,
totalizing perspective on society. Harvey (1996, 284) is very clear about the consequences of
this perspective: ‘to produce one dominant cartographic image out of all this multiplicity is a
power-laden act of domination’. In other words, a Euclidean perspective on space is just one of
many views on space. A single, true representation of space does not exist, and proceeding
otherwise neglects the heterogeneity of social life. Second, space as an absolute container can
enable a static, immutable perspective on society. The Euclidean container cannot change itself
— it is pre-existing after all — and thus might direct our attention to static patterns and less so
to social processes. Third and finally, space as an absolute container focuses on the location of
independent objects and ignores the relative and relational connections between people,
institutions and other actors that together make up social space.
This contrast begs the question of why there is such a disconnect between theoretical and
quantitative work on space within Geography. Why are we still content with the spatial
constraints of traditional desktop GIS software rather than developing Lefebvrian GIS or
Masseyian Mapping Software? In sum, why are we still actively using a quantitative
methodology that is inherently and ontologically incompatible with how we (theoretically) think
about society and space? To be clear, we are not calling for an abolishment of Euclidean space
altogether as its conceptualization is useful for many applications. Instead, our point is that it is
but one of many possible conceptualizations, and our reliance on it shapes our understanding
of the world.
While there are many historical factors beyond our simple summary here (cf. Schuurman 2006)
we use this understanding to document a moment during the 1950s and 1960s when
competing conceptualizations were in play including the surprisingly sophisticated use of
relational spatial ontologies in early work by spatial scientists. We suggest that ultimately, the
emergence of the personal computer and desktop GIS in the 1980s helps solidify a standard for
quantitative analysis of space that leaves less room for alternative conceptualizations. We
further contend that this history can provide useful guidance in how the discipline approaches
smart technologies today. This is similar to the impetus behind the field of geocomputation –
as Gahegan (1999, 203) put it: ‘GIS saw to it that geographers became the slaves of the
4

computer, having to adopt the impoverished representational and analysis capabilities that GIS
provided.’ It is our contention that a similar impoverishment of space need not, and should not,
occur in the present day.
Developing Spatial Science
Amidst an academic landscape in which Geography was increasingly threatened with
departments closed down, a re-orientation towards Spatial Science began in the 1950s. As a
spatial science, the goal was not to describe things within space, but rather to find general laws
and theories explaining space. With this, space shifted from just a container or handy filing
system to become the very nexus of geographic research. It is sometimes argued that this
‘revolution’ re-enforced the use of an absolute or ‘naïve’ spatial ontology within Geography
(e.g. Cresswell 2013, 103–5). However, the centrality of space to the new spatial science, meant
that many of its proponents and the contemporarily-cited works of the decade grappled
explicitly with the limitations of Euclidean space. For example, in his standard work on spatial
science, Harvey (1969, 210–11) writes:
‘Given the philosophy of absolute space, the metric in that space must remain isotropic
and constant. […] Relations between objects on the earth’s surface, the extent of areal
units, and so on, could be measured by the direct extension of Euclidean concepts of
space and distance to the surface of a sphere. […] This view is no longer generally
acceptable. Thus Watson (1955) has pointed out that distance can and must be
measured in terms of cost, time, social interaction and so on, if we were to gain any deep
insight in to the forces moulding geographic patterns. […] The metric is thus determined
by activity and by the influence of objects. Such a concept of distance is purely relative.’.
Importantly, Harvey was not isolated in this spatial thinking. Alternative, relational
conceptualizations of space (and the accompanying operationalization through mathematical
topology and graph theory) were en vogue well before Harvey’s observation. We highlight two
particularly noteworthy strains of this relational thinking within spatial science. The first
removes some of the limitations of Euclidean space by looking at non-Euclidean measures of
distance (e.g. perception, cost, etc.). The second strain is more explicit and forgoes twodimensional space altogether in favor of graph theory and network analysis.
Non-absolute conceptualizations of space
Some of the earliest traces of geographers using a non-absolute space are the so-called
‘potential maps’ of the 1950s. Here, geographers (and physicists-turned-geographers, see
Barnes and Wilson (2014)) borrow heavily from physics and use the concept of ‘potential’ to
study spatial phenomena such as population distribution and transportation accessibility
(Stewart and Warntz 1958). In a potential model, the value of a point is determined by its
connections – based on variables such as accessibility or economic pricing – to all other points.
5

For example, Harris (1954) uses it to calculate the market potential in the US, making it an
implicitly relational, not territorial concept.
The ideas within potential models were extended to map transformation (Hägerstrand 1957;
Tobler 1963) used this not to project the three-dimensional earth on a two-dimensional plane
but rather to transform Euclidean space to a more phenomenon-appropriate form. Hägerstrand
(1957) uses an innovative azimuthal projection centered on Asby, Sweden that is scaled
logarithmically to show that physical distance is not the most important determinant in
understanding migration (see Figure 1a). Tobler (1963) extends this innovation and argues
maps can be transformed based on other variables as well (similar to cartograms) and can even
be used to (quantitatively) compare and contrast these different spaces. Building from
Christaller’s theoretical model of central places (which assumes an underlying isotropic space)
Bunge (1966) and Getis (1963) demonstrated it was possible to transform space based on
population and income levels to better ‘fit’ the real-world empirical application (see Figure 1b).

Figure 1. Examples of non-absolute space in Geography from the 1950-1960s. A. Hägerstrand’s
(1957) use of an azimuthal projection centered on Asby that is scaled logarithmically to
illustrate that physical distance is not the most important determinant in understanding
migration; B. Bunge’s (1966) transformation of Christaller’s hexagonal space based on the
underlying population.
In methodologically-similar approaches, other spatial scientists studied cognitive spaces to
better understand how space is actually perceived. In the same way as Hägerstrand
transformed physical distance, the perception of space and distance can be drawn, compared
and analyzed — eventually kickstarting an entire subdiscipline of behavioral geography
(Golledge 1977; Gould and White 1974). One technique used in spatial science to deal with
these new spaces is multidimensional scaling (MDS) in which objects are defined by the
strength of their relationship to other objects rather than treated as independent. In cognitive
mapping, this can be used to show cognitive distortion (Golledge, Rivizzigno, and Spector 1976)

6

but can be equally useful in mapping other spaces, ranging from time-space (Marchand 1973)
to cost space (Forer 1978), and even ‘marriage’ space (Kendall 1971). In short, far from only
only using Euclidean spatial ontologies, this period represents an intense engagement with
spatial theories, including relational space. As Gatrell (1981, 151) argues “The proliferation of
different concepts of space has placed new demands […] for techniques to give tangible
expression to such concepts. The realization that a relative, rather than absolute, view of space
may offer a more appropriate context within which to map geographical objects […]”
Experimenting with graph theory
The most explicit use of relational space, however, can perhaps be found in the adoption of
graph theory in which space does not pre-exist at all but is defined through its constituent
parts. These parts consist of nodes (also called vertices) and the edges (or ties or links) between
them. Both vertices and edges can have certain characteristics indicating, for example, the
strength of a tie or the size of a node. Together, these nodes and their ties form a network,
which is why the term ‘network analysis’ is often used to refer to this type of analysis.
Arguably the first explicit use of graph theory in Geography was Garrison’s (1960) study of the
new US Interstate highway system. Garrison searched for a way to analyze these new highways
as a system and tentatively identified graph theory as a solution. Nystuen and Dacey (1961)
took Garrison’s first pass a step further and applied graph theory to the problem of
regionalization. Interested in the concept of the nodal region — a dominant central place or
nodal point with surrounding hinterland — they argued that graph theory was well suited to
express and analyze this hierarchy of cities or nodes. In an empirical study that could be labeled
‘novel’ even today, they used the number of direct long-distance telephone messages between
cities in and around Washington State to build a weighted network. In so doing, and without
explicitly expressing this, they projected a two-mode (person-city) network to a one-mode (citycity) network and used weighted degree centrality to detect the ‘nodal structure’ within this
network – forty years before the oft-cited Barrat et al. (2004) formalized weighted degree
centrality in the same way. A final note should be made of Hemmens’ 1966 dissertation on ‘the
spatial structure of urban activities’ (Hemmens 1966) in which he used trip data to determine
‘linkages’ between different zones in Buffalo, NY. He showed how zones cluster together in
distinct groups that are — very importantly — not necessary spatially contiguous. A conclusion
that would have been impossible to derive from the common, topographical perspective on
spatial clusters.
After the initial wave of work from American geographers, British geographers took over the
baton with Haggett and Chorley publishing a comprehensive standard work on ‘Network
Analysis in Geography’ (Haggett and Chorley 1969). It spends over 300 pages discussing
7

topological structures and graph theory and their application to geographic problems. Even in
the 1970s, network analysis still formed an important part of British geography with Peter
Taylor’s (1977) Quantitative Methods in Geography — an introduction to spatial analysis for
undergraduate students — discussing graph theory in its very first pages.
Despite this early work, by and large, graph theory and topological space dropped off the
quantitative geography radar during the 1980s, not to re-appear with any strength until the 21st
century. Perhaps coincidentally, this decline paralleled the appearance of the personal
computer in academic research and the standardization of tools – most notably ESRI’s launch of
the ARC/INFO GIS in the early 1980s. While these technologies heightened the speed and ease
of quantitative analysis, they also constrained the possibility frontier. After all, using off-theshelf software means accepting the techniques, methods and ontologies pre-programmed in
the software and potentially forgoing other approaches (cf. Rey 2009). A simple example of the
power of the affordances and standards offered by software is the de facto standard spatial
data format — the Shapefile — which, crucially for this article, has no awareness of topology.
Instead it uses a topographical ontology, where each object is defined by its exact location in a
Euclidean container. Thus, the narrowing of quantitative research within Geography might be
seen as an outcome of software-sorting (cf. Graham 2005) in which the code and algorithms
embedded in our tools shape our methods and ontologies.
Assembling a ‘smart’ symbiosis for Geography today
This short exposition of different spatial ontologies in spatial science illustrates the historical
interest in and potential for non-Euclidean spaces within quantitative geography. As Geography
grapples with how best to incorporate smart technologies in our research praxis, this history
and the ways in which some spatial ontologies were elevated and others dismissed is
particularly germane. One could imagine adoption of new technologies leading to an extension
of conventional GIS software or being applied to urban dashboards and governance. As such,
smart technology and data might enhance these systems by virtue of its data covering a larger
part of the population and social life, or even enable the adoption of participatory frameworks
as is often discussed or foreshadowed in the discourse around smart cities (Stratigea,
Papadopoulou, and Panagiotopoulou 2015), but this would not entail a more radical reimagining of such software and methods. In our assessment, this would be a disappointing
outcome.
Instead, we posit that these new technologies could usefully catalyze a more comprehensive reanchoring of computational geography to the theoretical foundations of our discipline, in line
with the calls for critical quantitative geography made in the past decade (Kwan and Schwanen
2009; Wyly 2011). In the recent discourse around critical GIS (O’Sullivan, Bergmann, and
8

Thatcher 2018; Thatcher, Bergmann, and O’Sullivan 2018) we find several contributions arguing
for a re-imagining of GIS (Gahegan 2018) and an opening up to different spatial ontologies
(Bergmann and O’Sullivan 2018). Likewise, the field of geocomputation (Cheng, Haworth, and
Manley 2012) brings together geography and computer science and, in Gahegan’s (1999)
reading, is specifically meant to alleviate the ‘shortcomings’ of GIS. Arribas-Bel and Reades
(2018) similarly posit geocomputation as a separate tradition focused on what the intersection
of geography and computing makes possible. In short, if we are to enter a smart era of
Geography, we would do well to heed these calls in earnest and use the unique opportunity
offered by new technologies and data sources to radically reimagine how we think
geographically through computation (methods); (new) data; and software. Luckily, against this
backdrop of new technologies, there are several examples of recent work that reimagines
quantitative geography across these three dimensions.
Reimagining Methods, Data and Software
In terms of methods, similar to the experiments with different ‘types’ of distance and relations
and Multidimensional Scaling, geographers have started to use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM).
SOM are a type of neural network and thus need to be ‘trained’. This training is computationally
intensive so this (similar to other machine and deep learning methods) is a methodological
approach enabled by the affordances of new, smart technology. Spielman and Thill (2008) use
SOM to understand the complex ‘attribute space’ of urban neighborhoods in New York (see
Figure 2a). The same technique can be expanded to understand spatial processes such as
neighborhood change (Delmelle 2017). Similarly, other authors have explicitly experimented
with relational spaces in quantitative work. For example, Shelton (2018) uses a relational
perspective on poverty and constructs networks of relations between rental properties
concentrated areas of poverty and their owners, which are often located in other
neighborhoods – showing that poverty itself is networked process (Figure 2b; see also Elwood
et al, 2017).

use Self Organizing Maps (SOM) to understand the complex ‘attribute space’ of urban
neighborhood. Here they show how SOM can be used to select neighborhoods that are similar
to the input selection (upper-left corner); B. Shelton (2018) uses a relational perspective to
show that property owners of rental housing in concentrated areas of poverty often live outside
those areas themselves; C. Lally and Bergmann (forthcoming) use their software ‘enfolding: a
prototype Geographical Imagination System (GIS)’1 to create a ‘wormhole’ that connects Creech
Air Force Base in Nevada, from which drones are operated, with the location of a US drone
strike in Marjah, Pakistan.

New technologies, such as smart phones, and new social practices that come along with these
technologies produce new types of finely grained data. These datasets range from social media
data and cell phone records to sensor data and smart card transactions and help to further
enable the aforementioned reimagination. For example, Shelton and Poorthuis (2019) use
social media data to redraw Atlanta’s neighborhood boundaries based on the spatial networks
of its inhabitants and contrast this with the official administrative and territorial boundaries.
Boeing (2018) uses OpenStreetMap data to perform an network analysis of street networks in
every US city at different levels of scale, while Wachsmuth and Weisler (2018) use data derived
from Airbnb to analyze the effect of short-term rentals of gentrification in New York.
Finally, we have seen a major resurgence of open-source geographic software, ranging from the
desktop GIS platform QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2019), to ecosystems around the pySAL
library (Rey and Anselin 2010) for Python and the sf (Pebesma 2018) library for R – allowing
geographers to more creatively develop and use research tools. Many of such software
packages contain relational concepts in addition to Euclidean or topographical tools opening up
possibilities for adoption of diverse theories of space. Moreover, the modular approach of
open-source software provides a pathway for reconnecting geography with network analysis, as
network analysis libraries for the Python and R ecosystems exist parallel to their spatial
counterparts. Ironically, network analysis has paid considerable attention to the spatial layout
and visualization of network graphs in recent years – so far without input from Geography. As
an example, building on top of the projection software proj.4, Bergmann and O Sullivan (2017)
explore how Tobler’s ideas for applying map projections to different spaces can be
implemented in modern geographic software. Although their suggested software hyperproj is
still only conceptual – an actual implementation isn’t far-fetched (see also Figure 2c).
Reproducible research and the open sharing of code and data, if not yet commonplace, is also
becoming more prevalent (Brunsdon 2016) and such approaches are increasingly an alternative
way of working existing next to, or in addition to, more conventional desktop GIS, as evidenced
in Arribas-Bel and Reades’ (2018) call for a Geographic Data Science.
Building a Critical and Smart symbiosis
Smart technologies and their implications have received well-deserved critical evaluation. Wyly
(2014) fears the co-optation by a ‘neo-liberal digital capitalism’ and Leszczynski (2018)
highlights epistemological limitations of digital methods that are now commonplace when
‘smart’ datasets are used in academic research. These critiques and worries are well-founded
but if taken to heart also highlight a unique opportunity: we can build a different, new vision on
the use of technology in Geography, paying particular attention to avoid some of the
11

disciplinary mistakes of the last 30 years. Indeed from our own research collaborations across
fields of computer science and engineering, we note that quantitative geographers can often be
more grounded in and appreciative of social and spatial theories than those coming from
outside of Geography.
To do so, we identify two specific points that echo Gahegan’s phrase that ‘our GIS is too small’
(2018). First, on a technical level, as a discipline we need to take charge of building and
maintaining our own software platforms. These platforms should be open, accessible and
modifiable by the entire academic community and reflect the diversity and heterogeneity of
our discipline. Similarly, as data is becoming increasingly commodified, we need to guard
against walled data gardens that provide access only to selected researchers. A more
widespread adoption of the principles behind reproducible research (Brunsdon 2016) in our
research, publishing and teaching would be an important cornerstone in achieving this.
Second, on a more substantive level, the computational approaches we use should allow us to
think creatively about geographic processes. We can draw inspiration from all corners of our
heterogenous field and its history, and build on top of and together with geographical theory
without constraining ourselves by what is possible with off-the-self software. This is especially
important for space – one of our core disciplinary concepts. Computational approaches must
enable researchers to freely reason with and about spatial processes. If we are to enable an
engaged pluralism (Sheppard and Plummer 2007) in Geography, our systems should be
designed to allow for contrasting spatial ontologies rather than constrain users to a single
perspective on the world.
The history of spatial science shows us that this connection between geographic theory and
quantitative methods is indeed possible. We now have the technology and datasets to enable
this connection in new, computational ways. To be clear, this is not a Geography in which smart
technology and computation completely remove the need for human input. Instead, this is a
Geography where social theory and the human intellect, in conjunction with computational
technologies, play a key role in analyzing the largest, most versatile and relevant dataset on
social space that we have ever had.
