Online Customer Service and Emotional Labor:
An Exploratory Study
Abstract
The recent growth of service industries as well as the rise of e-commerce has increased the
number of online customer service workers. Research on face-to-face service work has shown
that these workers are expected to display certain emotions in the course of their work, a
phenomenon known as emotional labor. However, little is known about emotional
communication among online customer service workers. We explored emotional labor in an
online context by examining the degree of emotional presence in mediated service interactions
and its relationship with workers’ acting strategies (i.e., surface acting, deep acting). Further, we
examined if emotional presence and acting strategies predict job satisfaction as well as burnout.
Data collected from 130 online customer service workers indicated that they perceive the highest
emotional presence in phone conversations, followed by email and chat. Although there was
little relationship between emotional presence and acting strategies, those who engage in surface
acting are less satisfied with their job and more likely to experience burnout. In addition, those
who feel a higher degree of emotional presence over the phone tend to experience higher job
satisfaction and less burnout. These findings suggest that online customer service workers also
engage in emotional labor.

Online Customer Service and Emotional Labor:
An Exploratory Study
1. Introduction
Recent Pew research reports that 89% of American adults use the Internet, and 72% of
now own a smartphone (Poushter, 2016). These smartphone owners, particularly, young adults,
are heavily dependent to their mobile devices to go online in their daily lives (Smith, 2015). The
penetration of internet use in society is also shown in another global survey, which reports that
55% of respondents are interested in grocery shopping online (Nielsen, 2015). To respond to
these online users, both traditional bricks and mortar and online only retailers offer online
customer service options, such as real-time chat or email. Industry watchers note that customer
preference for phone support is dropping, while email and chat are becoming more popular
options (Klie, 2013). In addition, both public and academic libraries have been increasing their
use of online patron services in the form of virtual reference desks (Olszewski & Rumbaugh,
2010), which typically offer both email and real-time chat options (Shaw & Spink, 2009).
Past research on face-to-face customer services has shown that these service workers
engage in what is known as emotional labor (Hochschild, 1983), which refers to jobs that require
the display of specific emotions as a part of the job (Miller, 2015). These service workers are
typically required to suppress negative emotions and display positive emotions when dealing
with customers to achieve organizational goals (Grandey, 2003; Groth, Henning-Thrau, &
Walsh, 2009). The rise in e-commerce has increased the need for online customer service
(Froehle, 2006; Jin & Oriaku, 2013), which can provide customers with more flexibility while
reducing costs for organizations (Jin & Oriaku).
Despite the increase in the use of online customer service by various types of
organizations, extant research on emotional labor has been predominantly conducted in face-to-

3
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
face contexts, and little is known about online workers. Early research on mediated
communication argued that the lack of nonverbal cues inherent in the medium reduced the
degree of social presence, which hindered the expression of emotion (Short, Williams, &
Christie, 1976). However, later research suggested that the degree of social presence was
subjectively determined by the user’s involvement in communication (Biocca, Harms, &
Burgoon, 2003; Gunawardena & Zittle, 1997). More recent research also suggests that
emotional content may be specifically difficult to interpret in online contexts, particularly among
strangers (as would be typically found in a customer service encounter). For example, while
people use various nonverbal cues (e.g., emoticons) to help express and interpret emotion online
(Derks, Fischer, & Bos, 2008), empirical tests have revealed mixed results in the ability of
senders and receivers to accurately encode and decode emotional content in text-based mediated
communication (Hancock, Landrigan & Silver, 2007; Riordan, 2011). Despite these difficulties
in online communication, the appropriate display of emotions is also critical for online customer
service workers. Thus, to fill a gap in past emotional labor research, we conducted an exploratory
study in mediated contexts, specifically, among online and phone customer service workers.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Emotion in Online Communication
Social presence theory (Short et al., 1976) posited that text-based mediated channels such
as email were likely to be poor conduits for emotional communication, primarily because of the
lack of synchronicity and nonverbal cues available when compared to face-to-face
communication. The theory identified social presence (i.e., a degree of salience of the other
communicator) as a property inherent in the medium used and argued that lower social presence
led to lower satisfaction among communicators (Cobb, 2011; Gunawardena & Zittle, 1997).

4
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
However, later research such as social information processing theory (Walther, 1992, 1995)
suggested that users can adapt to the constraints of the medium and mediated channels, in
particular, can support various types of relational communication, including immediacy and
affective communication, over time. Derks et al. (2008) concluded that overall there are
numerous ways that both positive and negative emotions are communicated via mediated
channels. Riordan and Kreuz (2010) found that although their participants generally preferred
face-to-face over email or instant messaging for emotional communication, email was sometimes
seen as having an advantage, particularly for communicating negative emotions. For example,
the asynchronous nature of email was preferred for its editing capabilities, and email was used to
act as a shield against negative emotions. The use of email for conveying negative emotions is
particularly relevant to the study of online customer service, given that negative emotions are
associated with the use of online customer support (McLean & Wilson, 2016) and that
complaints are likely to make up a large portion of customer emails (Gupta, Gilbert, & Di
Fabbrizio, 2013).
2.2. Emotional Presence
Because extant research has shown that users can adapt to the lower-cue environment of
mediated communication to conduct successful relational and emotional communication,
scholars have refined the concept of social presence from definitions that focus on a sense of
being together, to definitions that revolve around psychological involvement (Biocca et al.,
2003; Lee, 2004). Biocca et al. also warned against overly broad definitions of social presence
and argued that social presence is better conceived of as a phenomenological state (see also Lee,
2004), rather than a measure of a medium. Biocca et al. stated, "the theory of social presence is
likely to be a theory of how differences in technological connection, representations, and

5
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
mediated access affect, distort, or enhance the perception (mental model) of others’ intentional,
cognitive, and affective states and behavior resulting from those perceptions” (p. 473). Thus,
they found that social presence is a multidimensional concept.
Supporting their view, several studies (e.g., Cleveland-Innes & Campbell, 2012; Rourke,
Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 1999; Shen & Khalifa, 2008) have identified emotional or
affective presence as one dimension of social presence. However, much like the variation in the
definitions of social presence, definitions of emotional presence differ among these studies. In
particular, these studies tend to base their definitions of emotional presence in the context in
which it is being examined such as in online learning (Cleveland-Innes & Campbell; Rourke et
al.) or in online communities (Shen & Khalifa). For the purpose of this study we define
emotional presence as the degree to which communicators in a mediated context perceive they
are engaging in emotional communication with a real person.
Miller, Stiff, and Ellis (1988) noted two dimensions of empathy in their emotional labor
research: empathic concern (i.e., feeling for the client) and emotional contagion (i.e., feeling with
the client), with emotional contagion also being associated with burnout. Inherent in
experiencing emotional contagion is the ability to detect and respond to the emotions of others.
Therefore, in examining emotional labor among online customer service workers, it is critical to
establish the degree of emotional presence perceived over different communication channels, and
we first ask:
RQ1: What extent of emotional presence do customer service workers
experience when using each communication channel?
As stated earlier, despite the assumption of social presence theory (Short et al., 1976)
Gunawardena and Zittle (1997) argued that social presence inherent in the medium is less
important for communicators’ satisfaction because the degree of social presence can be increased

6
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
by frequent interactions with the other communicator, which, in turn, positively affects the
communicators’ satisfaction. Similarly, Lee (2004) suggests presence is related to virtual
experience. Based on these studies, we expect to see a positive relationship between frequent
communication and emotional presence, and the following hypothesis is proposed:
H1:

The frequency of communication with clients/customers will contribute to the
degree of emotional presence perceived in mediated contexts.

2.3. Online Customer Service Workers and Acting Strategies
As described earlier, the diffusion of advanced technology in society has increased the
need for online customer service (Froehle, 2006; Jin & Oriaku, 2013). Online services provide
customers with more flexibility, and for organizations, online services can reduce costs (Jin &
Oriaku, 2013).
Customer service workers are instrumental in influencing customer satisfaction with the
organization. For example, customer satisfaction is positively related to their emotional
experience with these workers (Christoforou & Ashforth, 2015; Oliver, 1997). In particular, a
smile from customer service representatives produces a higher level of customer satisfaction than
no smile (Söderlund & Rosengren, 2008). In addition, their positive emotions increase
customers’ word-of-mouth intentions over time (White, 2010). For these reasons, organizations
select service workers based on their personality traits such as extraversion (Tan, Foo, Chong, &
Ng, 2003), and many organizations set rules about emotional display to meet customers’
expectations (Goussinsky, 2011; Kruml & Geddes, 2000).
To conform to these rules, service workers use two strategies: (a) deep acting and (b)
surface acting (Kruml & Geddes, 2000). In deep acting, workers attempt to modify their felt
inner emotions to meet organizational goals (Grandey, 2003; Groth et al., 2009). In surface

7
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
acting, workers fake their true emotions (Groth et al., 2009) and modify their facial expressions
(Grandey, 2003) accordingly.
While it is well documented that surface and deep acting strategies are used in face-toface contexts, little is known about how customer service workers use these strategies when they
perceive emotions of customers in mediated interactions. Because past research in negative
contexts (e.g., service failures) showed that online customer service representatives have to work
harder than offline members to regain customer satisfaction and trust (Lii, Chien, Pant, & Lee,
2013), it is anticipated that online workers also use some acting strategies influenced by the
levels of emotional presence. Thus, the following hypothesis is developed:
H2:

The degree of emotional presence will contribute to acting strategies of online
customer service workers.

2.4. Outcomes from Acting Strategies
Past studies indicated that deep acting strategies increased personal accomplishments and
a sense of authenticity (Brotheridge & Lee, 2003) and were related to job satisfaction of
customer service workers, but the valence of the relationship with job satisfaction was mixed
across studies (e.g., Grandey, 2003; Medler-Liraz & Yagil, 2013). Surface acting strategies, in
contrast, were positively related to job performance (Goodwin et al., 2011), yet also consistently
found to be negatively related to job satisfaction (Blau, Bentley, & Eggerichs-Purcell, 2012;
Matteson & Miller, 2013; Scott, Barnes, & Wagner, 2012). This, in turn, led to stress (Chi,
Grandy, Diamond, & Krimmel, 2011), burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, reduced personal
accomplishment, and depersonalization), and turnover (Blau et al., 2012; Goodwin et al., 2011;
Grandey, 2003; Matteson & Miller, 2013).
Morris and Feldman (1996) suggested that job satisfaction and burnout are the important
job-related outcomes of emotional labor. In fact, these two have been studied as the essential

8
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
outcomes in emotional labor research in face-to-face contexts (e.g., Blau et al., 2012; Goodwin et
al., 2011; Grandey, 2003; Matteson & Miller, 2013; Scott et al., 2012). Thus, we focus on job
satisfaction and burnout in this exploratory study. Despite the mixed results of the effect of
acting strategies on the valence of job satisfaction, these past studies in face-to-face contexts
have shown that acting strategies were, indeed, related to both job satisfaction and burnout.
The literature suggests that mediated communication reduces some inhibitions, which
makes communication easier than directly facing uncomfortable situations (Keaten & Kelly,
2008), yet communicators can be more aggressive in mediated settings than in face-to-face
contexts (e.g., Odac & Celik, 2013). Further, as described earlier, online customer service
workers have to make more effort than face-to-face, particularly in post crisis situations (e.g., Lii
et al., 2013). Thus, these additional acting efforts by online customer service workers would
affect their job satisfaction and burnout. We therefore advance the following hypotheses:
H3: Acting strategies will predict job satisfaction of online customer service workers.
H4: Acting strategies will predict burnout of online customer service workers.
Finally, although previous research has indicated that emotions affect communicative
responsiveness in face-to-face communication and burnout of service workers (e.g., Miller et al.,
1988; Miller, Birkholt, Scott, & Stage, 1995; Snyder, 2012), the effect of perceived emotional
presence on job-related outcomes among online service workers is unknown. Therefore, we pose
the following questions:
RQ2: Will the degree of emotional presence predict job satisfaction of online customer
service workers?
RQ3: Will the degree of emotional presence predict burnout of online customer service
workers?

3. Method
This study was carried out using a web-based questionnaire. To recruit participants
customer service was defined broadly to include IT helpdesk work and librarian virtual reference
work, in addition to more traditional customer service sectors, such as retail. Online customer
service workers who use phone and/or other communication media (e.g., email, chat) were
invited to participate. A variety of online channels were used to recruit a convenience sample of
participants, including Twitter, Facebook, and several websites dedicated to sharing research
opportunitiesi. Participants were also recruited through the personal networks of the researchers.
3.1. Participants
Excluding 36 incomplete responses, the final usable data included 130 participants. A
majority (63.8%) were female (n = 83), and 26.2% were male (n = 34) with 10% choosing not to
respond to the demographic questions. About half of them (49.2%) were 18 to 34 years old, and
the rest were 35 years old or older. About half of them (47.7%) were librarians, and the rest
included customer service members from the computer/IT industry (13.1%), banking/financial
services (3.1%), telecommunications (2.3%), healthcare (1.5%), and others. Participants were
generally evenly distributed in the amount of time they had worked in their current positions,
with 18.5% working less than one year, 26.2% one to three years, 18.5% four to six years, 7.7%
seven to nine years, and 19.2% more than 10 years. Most of the respondents (n = 105) worked 20
hours or more for their current position and close to half (48.5%) spent 51% or more of their
total work time dealing with customers/clients.
Over half of the respondents reported they are used face-to-face (n = 67), phone (n = 79),
and email (n = 67) with their clients/customers daily. Only 29 people reported they used chat
with their clients/customers daily. While 62 participants reported never using chat with

10
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
clients/customers, only 12 reported never using email, and seven reported never using the phone.
Because close to half of our participants worked in the same industry (library), we ran a series of
chi-squares to determine if librarians, as a group, were significantly different in technology use,
work experience, and customer interaction from non-librarians. The results indicated that
librarians and non-librarians did not differ significantly on length of time in current position,
number of hours worked per week, or on percentage of time spent dealing with
clients/customers. In addition, librarians and non-librarians did not differ significantly on the
frequency of using email or phone to interact with clients/customers; however, they did differ on
the use of chat, with non-librarians being more likely to report not using chat, and librarians
being more likely to report using chat 1-3 times per week, χ2 (2, n = 116) = 22.52, p < .001.
3.2. Measurements
3.2.1. Emotional Presence
There is no single widely accepted measurement of social presence (Biocca et al., 2003).
For example, some measures include intimacy, and few studies have also looked at behavior as
indicators of perceived social presence. Similarly, the studies assessing emotional presence also
tend to use different scales, some of which overlap with social presence scales. In addition, the
existing social presence scales are not specific (Biocca et al., 2003). Because of the exploratory
nature of our topic, and the lack of a single, established measure for emotional presence, we
created our own scale based on past research. As discussed earlier, because emotional presence
is one dimension of social presence, we adapted three items from the Social Presence Scale
developed by Kreijins, Kirschner, Jochems, and Van Buuren (2004) In addition, because the
ability to detect and respond to emotions is an important part of the burnout aspect of emotional
labor (Miller et al., 1988), we modified four items from the Emotional Presence Scale used by

11
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
Cleveland-Innes and Campbell (2012) to address emotional communication directly. Our
modified items included a specific focus on the presence of negative emotions because negative
emotions have appeared to be the predominant emotions expressed in customer service email
(Gupta et al., 2013). The participants answered these items for each channel (phone, email, chat)
with a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
After a reliability test for each channel, two items (i.e., When I have a/an [CHAT,
EMAIL, or PHONE] conversation with a client/customer; I also feel that I deal with a very real
person and not with an abstract anonymous person, and [CHAT, EMAIL, or PHONE]
conversation with a client/customer can hardly be distinguished from face-to-face conversation)
were dropped. Cronbach’s alpha with the rest of five items was satisfactory for Email (α = .70)
and Phone (α = .72), but not for Chat (α = .53). The final Emotional Presence Scale for Chat (α
= .71) became two items (i.e., When I have a chat conversation with a client/customer, I can
easily tell if he/she is angry or upset; I find it difficult to determine a client/customer’s emotional
state when having a conversation via chat). (See Appendix).
3.2.2. Frequency of Mediated Communication with Clients/Customers
One question asked the frequency of communication with clients/customers with each
channel (i.e., FtF, phone, email, chat, other to specify) in a typical week. Participants answered
using a 6-point Likert-type scale from 0 (none), 1 (once a week), 2 (twice a week), 3 (three times
a week), 4 (four times a week), and 5 (daily).
3.2.3. Acting Strategies
Similar to past studies, we investigated two types of acting strategies: (a) surface acting
and (b) deep acting. All items of these acting strategies were answered by a 5-point Likert-type
scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

12
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
3.2.3.1. Surface Acting
Surface acting was assessed by a modified version of the Surface Acting Scale used by
Diefendorff, Cryole, and Gosserand (2005). The seven-item scale was a combination of five
items from Grandey’s (2003) Surface Acting Scale and two items from Kruml and Geddes’
(2000) emotive dissonance scale. We adjusted the wording for our participants by adding
clients/customers to their original scale, which indicated only customers. Cronbach’s alpha with
our sample was .94.
3.2.3.2. Deep Acting
Deep acting was assessed by a modified version of the Deep Acting Scale used by
Diefendorff et al. (2005). Their scale was composed of three items adapted from Grandey’s
(2003) Deep Acting Scale and one item adapted from Kruml and Geddes’ (2000) Emotive Effort
Scale. Similar to surface acting, we added clients/customers to their original Deep Acting Scale
to adjust for our participants. The modified scale also demonstrated a good reliability (α = .90).
3.2.4. Burnout
Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslach & Jackson,
1981), which was adapted by Miller and Koesten (2008). Their adapted MBI has three subscales
including (a) 10 items of emotional exhaustion (i.e., a general wearing down from work), (b) 5
items of depersonalization (i.e., the tendency to treat clients in cynical or depersonalized ways),
and (c) 6 items of reduced personal accomplishment (i.e., the feeling that little can be
accomplished on the job). Participants rated each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Cronbach’s alphas were .84 for emotional
exhaustion; .79 for reduced personal accomplishment, and .82 for depersonalization.
3.2.5. Job Satisfaction

13
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
Job satisfaction was measured with a six-item scale, which was originally developed
from Price and Mueller (1986) and adapted by Miller and Koesten (2008). Participants rated
each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
Cronbach’s alpha was .90.
3.3. Data Analysis
A bivariate correlation analysis was first run to see the bivariate relationship among all
testing variables (see Table 1). RQ1 was answered by the mean of each emotional presence.
Because our preliminary analysis showed the significant difference in the use of chat among the
participants (see the Participants’ section for detail), we focused on emotional presence in phone
and email in the following data analyses. H1 and H2 were tested by a bivariate linear regression
analysis respectively. To test H3 and H4 we ran a series of multiple regression analyses of acting
strategies (i.e., surface acting, deep acting) for each dependent variable (i.e., job satisfaction,
emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment). To answer
RQ2 and RQ3, we ran a series of multiple regression analyses of emotional presence (i.e., phone,
email) for each dependent variable (i.e., job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment).

4. Results
4.1. Degree of Emotional Presence
The result of descriptive analysis showed the mean of perceived emotional presence was
3.23 (SD = .85) for chat, 3.53 (SD = .62) for email, and 3.94 (SD = .57) for phone. As noted
earlier, the overall use of chat by our participants was low and was significantly different
between librarian and non-librarian groups. Thus, chat was dropped from the follow-up test. The
result of a paired sample t-test for emotional presence in phone and email was significant (t (94)
= 6.55, p < .001).
4.2. Emotional Presence and Frequency of Mediated Communication with Clients/Customers
Based on the results of bivariate correlation analysis (Table 1), a predictive relationship
between the frequency of communication and perceived emotional presence was tested only for
email. The result was significant (t (97) = 3.40, p = .001, Adjusted R2 = .10). Thus, Hypothesis 1
was partially supported.
4.3. Emotional Presence and Acting Strategies
The results of bivariate correlation analysis (Table 1) exhibited no significant association
between emotional presence and deep acting strategy. Based on the correlation results, emotional
presence over the phone and surface acting strategy were forwarded to a linear regression
analysis. The result was significant (t (98) = -2.57, p < .05, Adjusted R2 = .05), which rendered
partial support for Hypothesis 2.
4.4. Acting Strategies and Job Satisfaction
The result of a multiple regression analysis of acting strategies for job satisfaction was
significant (F (2, 100) = 19.98, p < .001, Adjusted R2 = .27), but surface acting strategy was the
only significant negative predictor of job satisfaction (β = -.49, p < .001).

16

4.5. Acting Strategies and Burnout
A multiple regression analysis of acting strategies for burnout showed the significant
results for emotional exhaustion (F (2, 104) = 39.12, p < .001, Adjusted R2 = .42) and
depersonalization (F (2, 100) = 22.17, p < .001, Adjusted R2 = .29). The regression model for
reduced personal accomplishment was marginally significant (F (2, 83) = 3.08, p = .05, Adjusted
R2 = .05). For acting strategies, only surface acting was a significant positive predictor of
emotional exhaustion (β = .63, p < .001); depersonalization, (β = .52, p < .001); and reduced
personal accomplishment (β = .22, p < .05). (See Table 2).

4.6. Emotional Presence and Job Satisfaction
The regression model for job satisfaction was marginally significant (F (2, 84) = 3.05, p
= .05, Adjusted R2 = .07). Among the models, emotional presence over the phone was the only
significant positive predictor of job satisfaction (β = .29, p < .05).
4.7. Emotional Presence and Burnout

significant (F (2, 88) = 3.14, p < .05, Adjusted R2 = .05 for emotional exhaustion; (F (2, 86) =
16.01, p < .001, Adjusted R2 = .27 for depersonalization; (F (2, 70) = 31.49, p < .001, Adjusted
R2 = .47 for reduced personal accomplishment). Likewise, emotional presence over the phone
was the only significant negative predictor of each of the burnout outcomes (β = -.25, p < .05 for
emotional exhaustion; β = -.59, p < .001 for depersonalization; β = -.56, p < .001 for reduced
personal accomplishment). Details of these regression analyses are presented in Table 3.

5. Discussion
The recent growth of service industries as well as the rise of e-commerce has produced an
increasing number of online customer service workers. As discussed earlier, customer service
work has been identified as involving emotional labor. Because emotional labor has been
predominantly studied in traditional face-to-face contexts, we examined communication among
online customer service workers to explore the ways that emotional labor plays out in mediated
service interactions. Although social presence theory (Short et al., 1976) suggests that the lack of
cues inherent in mediated communication will make such communication less effective, because
of the reduced sense of social presence, the theory has received criticisms for being too focused
on characteristics of communication media and for being overly broad and abstract (Biocca et al.,
2003; Lee, 2004). Following other researchers (e.g., Cleveland-Innes & Campbell, 2012; Rourke
et al., 1999; Shen & Khalifa, 2008), we focused on one dimension of social presence, emotional
presence, as being more relevant to emotional labor and online customer service work in that it
may affect workers’ abilities to communicate effectively.
Online customer service workers in this study reported the highest emotional presence
for phone conversations, followed by email and chat. In addition, emotional presence over phone
was significantly different from that of email. These results appeared somewhat consistent with
social presence theory (Short et al., 1976). Similar to social presence, more nonverbal cues (e.g.,
tone of voice) may contribute to a higher degree of perceived emotional presence of the other
communicator. However, social presence theory would also predict that chat, as a synchronous
channel, would be rated more highly in presence than email, as an asynchronous channel, which
was not the case with our participants. These results may be explained in part channel expansion
theory (Carlson & Zmud, 1999; D’Urso & Rains, 2008), which argues that the richness (in terms

19
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
of available cues) of a given medium is partially a perception based on users’ subjective
experiences, rather than being fixed by the characteristics of the medium. Given that close to half
of our participants reported never using chat with clients/customers, their greater experience with
email might lead to them perceiving it to be higher in emotional presence than chat. Further
research with customer service workers who use email and chat at similar rates is clearly
warranted. In addition, we found that while librarians and non-librarians were not significantly
different in their use of the phone or email, librarians were more likely to report using face-toface and chat to communicate with patrons than were non-librarians. Given the growth of virtual
reference services (Olszewski & Rumbaugh, 2010) with multiple channels (e.g., phone, email,
chat), future research could examine how the use of a range of channels for service work impacts
the perception of emotional presence and emotional labor.
We also tested how frequent communication over a particular channel was related to the
degree of perceived emotional presence. A significant predictive relationship was found only
over email communication. While emotional presence in email was lower than phone, frequent
communication over this asynchronous channel may be able to increase the degree of affective
presence, as users adapt to the medium (see Walther, 1992, 1995). There may be a ceiling effect
for emotional presence, such that the synchronous, higher-cue environment of phone
conversations does not benefit from any increase in frequency of use. In addition, there was no
relationship between frequency of chat use and perceived emotional presence over chat, which
may be a result of the lower numbers of participants who used chat. In order to better determine
the effects of synchronicity, cues and experience on emotional presence, we suggest that future
research compare more text-based asynchronous channels (e.g., discussion forums, email) to
synchronous (e.g., texting, chat) ones. Alternately, investigations on the use of social media for

20
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
customer service (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) synchronously and asynchronously may also clarify
this issue.
Emotional labor involves the expectation of workers to display certain feelings (Miller,
2015). In particular, service workers are strictly expected to show positive emotions toward
customers (Goussinsky, 2011) because it relates to customer satisfaction (Oliver, 1997; White,
2010), and past studies discovered that these workers use either surface acting or deep acting
strategies to meet their organizational rules (Kruml & Geddes, 2000). As the organizational rules
for customer satisfaction also apply to online workers, we explored how online customer service
workers actually use these two strategies, and how emotional presence are related to these
strategies in mediated communication. Our results indicated that emotional presence over phone
conversations with customers negatively predicted surface acting, indicating that the more
emotionally present workers perceived their interactions to be, the less likely they were to
employ surface acting strategies. Because customers can detect customer service workers’ acting
behaviors (Groth et al., 2009), perhaps workers are anxious about their customers, when they
have a higher degree of emotional presence, and they are more careful about acting over the
phone than other channels such as email and chat. This issue also needs further attention in the
future.
Our results demonstrated no significant relationship between deep acting and the degree
of emotional presence over any of the communication channels we examined. A possible reason
is that deep acting may depend heavily on the contexts with which customer service workers
deal. For example, workers may need to engage in deep acting behavior for customers in more
personal settings like health care. It appeared our participants do not require deep acting
strategies.

21
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
We were also concerned about how acting strategies and emotional presence would affect
job outcomes typically associated with emotional labor. Our results demonstrated that
engagement in surface acting leads to lower job satisfaction of mediated customer service
workers. More importantly, their surface acting behaviors lead to burnout in terms of emotional
exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. These results mirrored
past studies in face-to-face contexts (e.g., Blau et al., 2012; Goodwin et al., 2011; Grandy, 2003;
Matterson & Miller, 2013; Scott et al., 2012). Although we did not find any significant results
from their deep acting behaviors, the above results from their surface acting behaviors showed
that customer service workers can also suffer negative outcomes when engaging in acting
through mediated communication. Similar to frontline service workers in face-to-face contexts,
online customer service workers also experience burnout.
However, emotional presence in phone interactions leads to opposite job outcomes, such
that when online customer service workers perceive more emotional presence over the phone,
they reported higher job satisfaction, and they were less likely to experience all three dimensions
of burnout. Similar to the media characteristics approach (e.g., social presence theory, media
richness theory), which argues that channels that have a high degree of social presence or
richness can handle more complicated issues, perhaps, customer service workers can handle
more difficult issues over the phone than over email because they feel closer to the customers.
Thus, those who feel a higher degree of emotional presence will experience more job satisfaction
and less burnout. Although this study did not specifically examine empathic concern and
emotional contagion, it may be that emotional presence is related to empathic concern, such that
online customer service workers who perceive a higher degree of emotional presence over a
channel may also find it easier to develop the detached concern that has been shown to have

22
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
positive outcomes (Miller et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1995; Miller & Koesten, 2008; Snyder,
2012). Future research on emotional labor in online contexts should examine how emotional
presence might fit with the other elements of the burnout model.
6. Practical Implications
Despite this exploratory study, our findings indicated that organizations also need to pay
attention to online workers because they do engage in emotional communication with their
customers in a similar way to face-to-face contexts. Past face-to-face studies exhibited that
service workers show positive emotions when customer demands (e.g., additional requests) are
high (Tan et al., 2003) and when customers behave aggressively (Goussinsky, 2011). These
situations could occur in online contexts today, and to conform to organizational policies,
workers use acting strategies. Skilled workers may be able to handle difficult situations very
well, yet our results showed their surface acting behavior generates negative outcomes including
burnout and job dissatisfaction. Because skilled workers are the ones who can contribute to
organizational success and, thus, they are the ones whom the organization wishes to retain
(Goussinsky, 2011), organizational management should provide support for these workers.
Although displaying positive emotions is one important skill of service workers need to
meet customers’ expectations, a study by Söderlund and Rosengren (2008) indicated that
technical service quality moderates the level of customer satisfaction. Thus, organizations should
also provide training to customer service workers to increase their technical service quality. By
improving technical service quality, their acting behavior may be able to produce positive
outcomes. Recursively, we expect service workers would display authentic positive emotions
toward customers.

7. Conclusions
Similar to other studies, we acknowledge the limitations of this study in interpreting the
results. First, we recruited online customer service workers via publicly available web sites,
social media, and personal networks and collected self-reported data via an online survey
questionnaire. In addition, our sample size of this exploratory study was not large. Further, while
some of our participants claimed that they used all three communication channels (e.g., phone,
email, chat) when dealing with their customers, the use of chat was much lower, limiting our
outcomes testing to the phone and email channels. All of these factors may have influenced the
validity of this study. However, it is more important that we shed light on the emergent and
critical area of emotional labor in online customer service. The findings of this exploratory study
provided some evidence that online customer workers also engage in emotional labor. Expanding
emotional labor research into online service contexts will provide benefits for workers in all
types of environments.
We see multiple avenues in this critical research area. First, we looked into emotional
presence as one important dimension of social presence in this study. However, as discussed
earlier, social presence has multiple dimensions (Biocca et al., 2003). Thus, future studies should
further investigate other dimensions of social presence among online customer service workers.
Second, we did not look at the relationship with customers, but the duration or the
frequency of the interaction with unpleasant customers may exhibit differences in outcomes.
More specifically, a call center representative typically deals with an unpleasant customer one
time, whereas healthcare provider may need to develop a long-term relationship even with such
an unpleasant or aggressive client (Dollard, Dormann, Boyd, Winefield, & Winefield, 2003).

24
ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE
Thus, those who need to develop a long-term relationship with an unpleasant client may always
need to engage in acting strategies, which may lead to burnout.
Third, the literature suggests that emotionally intelligent people have a larger capacity to
maintain positive emotions in times of stress (Barrett & Gross, 2001). Indeed, higher emotionally
intelligent people produce better performance in the service fields including real estates and
insurance agencies (Kidwell, Hardesty, Murtha, & Sheng, 2011). However, emotional
intelligence studies are also predominantly in face-to-face contexts, and little is known about
how emotional intelligence manifests in online contexts. As such, this topic should also be
studied in online contexts in the future. If the positive relationship between emotional
intelligence and performance is also established in online contexts, the evidence can suggest that
emotional intelligence should be an important selection criterion of online customer service
workers.
