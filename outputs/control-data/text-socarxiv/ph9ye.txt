Abstract
Prior research on the empirical relationship between anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions and economic growth, as measured by increases in gross domestic product (GDP),
indicate that a 1% growth in GDP can lead to anything between an increase in emissions by
2.5% to a decline by 0.3%. Studies have paid little attention to independent mechanisms that
reduce emissions. Statistical properties of the data undermine the estimation techniques used
in many studies. To address these shortcomings, we used novel methods and panel data
integrating emissions, economic, and energy-system characteristics across 70 economies over
1970-2013 to derive a universal GDP-emissions relationship and identify key emissionsreduction mechanisms. We found that, robust to a variety of estimation procedures, every 1%
increase in GDP was associated with a 1% increase in CO2 emissions when controlling for
other mechanisms. Emissions reductions were mainly driven by four mechanisms: (i) energy
system decarbonization, (ii) increased economic efficiency, (iii) electrification, and (iv)
deindustrialization. A 1% increase in these factors was associated with 0.2-1.8% reductions in
CO2 emissions per year; together, these factors contributed to 18 petagrams of emissions
reduction globally over 1970-2013. Decarbonization contributed most to emissions reductions
in high-income economies, while economic efficiency and electrification contributed most to
reductions in low-income economies.
Keywords: CO2-GDP elasticity, carbon reduction mechanisms, environmental sustainability,
economic growth
Significance Statement
National commitments to climate change mitigations are impeded by a widely perceived
economy–environment tradeoff. Empirical literature has sought and failed to identify a
consistent CO2-GDP relationship and less is known about the effect of different emissionsreduction mechanisms. We quantify these mechanisms explaining recent observed CO2
emissions reductions during periods of GDP growth, focusing on economic structural changes
and energy system transformations. Remarkably, when these mechanisms are adequately
considered, the influence of GDP growth is unequivocally proportional to emissions growth
and a large fraction of the variation in emissions across >3,000 country-year observations is
explained. Our study shows that moving to low-carbon energy sources and shifting economic
activity from industry to services have indeed been effective mechanisms to reduce emissions.

Introduction
The empirical relationship between CO2 emissions and economic development has attracted broad
interest from researchers and policy makers alike (1). Prior studies have focused on identifying this
relationship by estimating the elasticity of CO2 with respect to the gross domestic product (GDP):
the percentage change in a country’s CO2 emissions for every 1% increase in GDP. Studies have
variously shown everything from a 0.3% decrease to a 2.5% increase in CO2 emissions for every
percent growth in a country’s GDP (2-20). As a result, they suggest fundamentally different
patterns between economic growth and CO2 emissions (Fig. 1 a-b). Variation in these estimates has
been attributed to sample selection (Fig. 1 b) and to the failure to adequately address problematic
properties of the analyzed data, such as non-stationarity (21), endogeneity (19, 22), and crosssectional heterogeneity (7, 23), which are known to lead to spurious results.
More problematically, such GDP-focused statistical studies of past emission trends have provided
little insight into factors that shape a country’s CO2 emissions, such as particular kinds of policies
or changes in economic structure (24). The literature is especially inadequate at explaining why
some countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Romania,
Poland, and Hungary (25-27), have been able to reconcile GDP growth with emission reductions.
A popular explanation for emissions reductions is the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)
hypothesis (e.g., (6, 28, 29)), which posits that people have an increasing willingness-to-pay for
environmental quality once they become sufficiently affluent. Yet, recent studies have disputed the
methodological robustness of the EKC literature and largely undermined the EKC hypothesis for
CO2 emissions (7, 30). Other explanations for declining CO2 emissions have included the
offshoring of heavy industries and increased trade, but the evidence about these mechanisms
remains contradictory (18-20, 22, 31).
To address these gaps, we develop a novel empirical model using a rich panel data set from 70
countries between 1970-2013. Methodologically, we develop a two-equation simultaneous model,
with one equation describing the augmented Solow growth model and the other determining
changes in CO2 emissions conditional on GDP growth. We model how changes in CO2 emissions
were determined through GDP growth-related and non-growth-related mechanisms to understand
the empirical association with emissions reductions. Our model specification circumvents the
common challenges of endogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional heterogeneity and
ensures that the empirical relationships are consistently estimated. Based on the empirical
relationships and the observed year-to-year changes in the panel, we then identify key mechanisms
for emissions reduction and quantify their effects. Our analyses are enabled by recent developments
in data availability: our panel data set includes information about national CO2 emissions,
economic growth, energy system transitions, and other emission-relevant mechanisms observed
over the past 44 years (1970-2013), covering 80-90% of the global CO2 emissions, primary energy
use, population, and GDP. The data set and the model are explained in detail in Data and Methods
and Supplementary Information B.

suggested by the CO2-GDP elasticity estimated by previous studies (ranging from -0.3 to 2.5),
which are reviewed in detail in Supplementary Information A; c-e, observed (165 countries, 19702015) CO2 emissions related to fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes vs. real GDP in
constant U.S. dollars (c), energy intensity of GDP (d), and CO2 intensity of primary energy supply
(e); (c) shows a fairly strong positive correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions. A reducedform analysis that controls for country- and year-fixed effects indicates a CO2-GDP elasticity=0.77
(p<0.001), i.e., a 1% of GDP growth is associated with a 0.77% increase in CO2 emissions on
average. The less than unitary CO2-GDP relationship, referred to as relative decoupling, is
consistent with the findings of many recent empirical studies e.g., (15-18, 20). Despite a lack of
empirical proof, the reduced emission rate is commonly attributed to the falling energy intensities
of GDP illustrated in (d), given the energy supplies have been decarbonizing at very slow rates
across the world (e).

Using our benchmark model (containing one CO2 equation and one GDP equation), we find that
annual GDP growth had a 1:1 association with increases in carbon emissions (Table 1 and Table
S4). A 1% increase in GDP was associated with a 1% increase in CO2 emissions on average,
holding all other factors constant. Our estimates of this elasticity are robust to various model
specifications, including for lagged economic growth, asymmetric effects of economic expansions

versus recessions, split sample specifications by economic development level, and expanding to a
three-equation (CO2, primary energy use, and GDP) simultaneous model (Table S5-6). Our
estimates are also robust to models with five-year rolling windows, eliminating the influence of
cyclical variations, and to alternative economic and emission data sources (Table S7).

Further, economic and energy-related factors in our statistical model explain observed carbon
emissions reductions. We find that a 1% increase in total factor productivity (TFP), describing a
country’s overall economic efficiency, was associated in our panel with a 1% annual increase in
GDP and a 0.6% annual reduction in the carbon intensity of GDP, thereby limiting the net increase
in emissions to 0.4% per year, on average (Table 1). Consistent with conventional wisdom that the
growth of services dampens CO2 emissions, our results also show that as the share of non-industrial
output grew by 1%, CO2 emissions were reduced on average by about 0.5% per year. The majority
(>80%) of the emissions-reducing effect of service growth was attributable to a reduction in
primary energy use (Table S6). We also find that increases in intangible assets dampened the effect
of GDP growth on carbon emissions (Table S4). In other words, we find that economic growth was

associated with lower carbon emissions in countries that increasingly invested in intangible assets
such as software and patents. The accounting rules for intangible assets, however, are relatively
new and the heterogeneity within the four aggregated asset classes (Structural, Machinery,
Transport Equipment, and Intangibles (27)) may obscure the underlying relationship.

To quantify the total CO2 emissions contributions of the main mechanisms over 1970-2013, we
combined bootstrapped empirical relationships uncovered from our benchmark model with
observed year-to-year changes in our panel (2,955 observations, see Table 1 and Supplementary
Information D). Emission rates changes from year-to-year ranged from -7% to +12% in response
to observed changes in the GDP (95% confidence interval (CI)) across the sample (Fig. 2a left).
The changes of GDP, with GDP growth observed in 86% of the country-year pairs, increased the

We also estimate that decarbonization and electrification contributed to reduced carbon emissions
during our observation period (p<0.05, Table 1 and Table S6). Specifically, a 1% annual growth
in the share of non-fossil energy was associated with a 1.8% annual decrease in CO2 emissions on
average. Two-thirds of this reduction was attributable to lower carbon intensity, and the rest to
lower overall energy use. The latter estimate could indicate that non-fossil fuels were more efficient
overall than fossil fuels during our observation period, but this result could also be attributable to
different accounting approaches used for calculating the primary energy content of fossil and nonfossil fuels (32). Among fossil fuels, we find that decarbonization associated with natural gas
displacing coal and oil (also known as fuel switching), also accounted for large reductions in
emissions. We estimate that annual CO2 emissions decreased by between 0.2% and 0.5% with
every 1% increase in the share of natural gas substituted for oil and coal, respectively. The
decarbonization effect of natural gas being substituted for oil arose mainly from energy efficiency
gains. The effect of natural gas substituted for coal, meanwhile, arose from both reduced carbon
intensity (60%) and improved energy efficiency (40%). We also find that, with the same fuel mix,
electrification contributed to reduced carbon emissions by improving energy efficiency: on
average, every 1% increase in the share of electricity in the final energy supply was associated with
a 1% decrease in annual CO2 emissions.
Our benchmark model shows that national CO2 emissions could also be reduced through other
mechanisms (Table 1) but with minimal implications for global climate change. Annual CO2
emissions decreased by 0.2% annually with a 1% annual increase in a country’s trade deficit. These
reductions were realized through energy outsourcing, which decreased emissions in some regions
while increasing emissions in other regions (Table S6). The corresponding emissions outcomes
were likely cancelled out on the global level (this is affirmed in later analyses, see Fig. 2a). Our
results also showed that increases in the average temperature of the coldest month in a year by 1°C
was associated with a 0.4% annual reduction in carbon emissions over the observation period. We
find little evidence that changes in CO2 emissions were driven by time-invariant country
characteristics, contemporaneous shocks, or trends. The goodness-of-fit of our model as measured
by R-squared is 0.53, as compared to R-squared statistics of between 0.05-0.27 for prior models
(13, 15). Statistical tests indicate our model circumvents or greatly alleviates several critical
estimation problems related to the properties of our analyzed data: non-stationarity, endogeneity,
and cross-sectional correlation (Supplementary Information C5). Our estimates are robust to
alternative model specifications and data sources (Table S5-7).

emissions rate by 25 to 37 petagrams (Pg) (95% CI) between 1970 and 2013 (Fig. 2a right).
Changes in productivity and electrification offset this rise by 3-9 Pg. The mix of upward and
downward trends in the other mechanisms does not allow us to discern a statistically significant
effect of these on the global total. Our results are consistent with prior findings that per capita GDP
growth and population increases are the main drivers of CO2 emissions (33-35). Yet, our results
differ from prior findings in one important respect: Prior assessments assume that changes in each
mechanism contribute to proportional and independent changes in carbon emissions; for instance,
that a doubling of energy intensity will lead to a doubling of emissions. By contrast, our results are
based on empirically estimated relationships (Table 1). Most of our estimates demonstrate nonproportional changes in carbon emissions, arising from stochastic influences and
interdependencies.

relationships estimated from the benchmark model. a. (left) percentage contribution to annual

benchmark model, the shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval of the percentage

and yellow lines indicate the median percentage contribution values. (right) net contributions to
CO2 emissions during 1970-2013 (in petagrams, Pg). Error bars show the net CO2 contributions
calculated from the 95% bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval. b. is the same as a.
except only emission reductions contributed by forces (2)-(9) are accounted for in b. Sample
coverage is shown in parentheses. Based on b., c. shows the relative contributions of forces (2)-(9)
by development level and period. d. when CO2 reduction accompanied by GDP growth was
observed (“circle”), computed results show CO2 emissions reduction in the same year (“colored
circles”). Color of the circle indicates the dominant emission reduction force: deindustrialization
and economic efficiency (red), decarbonization and electrification (blue), and trade deficit and
winter warming (grey). Quantities of CO2 and GDP in d. are normalized to 1 in 1971.
Understanding past CO2 emissions reductions is important to the design and evaluation of
emissions abatement policies and mechanisms. By limiting the analysis to country-year pairs with
CO2 reductions, we find that (i) energy system decarbonization contributed up to 12% national CO2
emissions reduction per year (Fig. 2b left, (4)+(5)+(6)) and a total of 8 Pg in global CO2 emission
abatements over 1970-2013 (Fig. 2b right, (4)+(5)+(6)), (ii) economic efficiency contributed up to
5% national emissions reduction and 6 Pg in global emission abatements, (iii) electrification
contributed 3% national emissions reduction and 3 Pg in global emission abatements, and (iv)
deindustrialization contributed up to 2% national emissions reduction and 1 Pg in global emission
abatements. These desirable mechanisms were present in 43%-70% of our sample (Fig. 2b left).
Further, we find that the importance of these mechanisms differed across countries, depending on
their level of development (Fig. 2c). Emissions reductions in developed economies over the 44year period were dominated by energy system transitions (53%), the majority of which were
associated with decarbonization policies (37%). These patterns were similar in our full sample of
70 economies, demonstrating that global emissions reductions were led by reductions in developed
economies. By contrast, across emerging economies, the two primary mechanisms for emission
reductions were advances in economic efficiency (41%) and electrification (20%). We find that the
importance of these two mechanisms in global CO2 reductions has grown steadily since the 1980s,
reflecting the rise of emerging economies and their increasingly influential role in global emission
trends (Fig. 2d).
For over 70% of the observed occurrences of simultaneous CO2 decline and GDP growth over
1970-2013, our model also predicts net emission reductions. Such consistency is most notable for
a range of advanced and transition economies, namely, Sweden, Denmark, France, Switzerland,
Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Luxembourg, Poland, Bulgaria, and Uruguay, where the
estimated outcomes of net emissions reductions match repeated occurrences of emissions decline
(≥10 years) coupled with GDP growth observed in the data. As Fig. 2d shows, in Denmark and the
UK, CO2 emissions reductions during periods of GDP growth were mainly driven by energy system
transformations. In Poland, these reductions were led by energy system transformations and
economic development over time.

If the same mechanisms held in the near future, we can identify GDP growth rates that are
compatible with stabilizing or declining CO2 emission rates based on (1) plausible and internally
consistent dynamics of the economic and energy developments captured in our data and (2)
statistically significant empirical relationships we estimated for GDP growth, productivity, service
growth, decarbonization, and electrification (see Supplementary Information E). Our analytical
approach thus assumes that future CO2 emissions will be influenced by the same mechanisms as in
the past. This assumption appears plausible considering that we found no apparent trends in our
sample over the 44-year period: national spending on emission abatement programs remains low
and stagnant (1) and abatement technologies such as carbon capture and sequestrations (CCS) are
commercializing and deploying at a very slow rate (36, 37).

Under these assumptions, we estimate that stabilizing or declining CO2 emissions, accompanied
by varying rates of positive economic growth, can be achieved in roughly 40% of countries in our
sample (Fig. 3a). These countries currently account for 35% of the global population and for more
than half of global economic output and CO2 emissions (Fig. 3b). The viability of achieving
economic growth while stabilizing or reducing CO2 emissions drops dramatically for higher
economic growth targets. If GDP grows by >1%, >2%, >4%, and >6%, stabilized or reduced sameyear CO2 emissions can be expected in roughly 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5% of countries in our sample,
respectively (Fig. 3a). The percentage of countries that can sustainably achieve economic growth
while stabilizing or reducing their carbon emissions is higher among developed economies than
among emerging economies (Fig. 3c). We find little evidence that the prospect for sustainable
economic growth has increased over time (Fig. 3d).

This analysis provides empirical explanations and verifications of key carbon mitigation
mechanisms able to offset the driving impact of GDP growth. Our findings suggest that energy
system transitions indeed reduce CO2 emissions, a fact that has been disputed by previous empirical
analysis (41), and that these transitions have been most important in developed economies. In
developing economies, decarbonization can be assisted by increases in economic efficiency and
electrification. Previously, knowledge on how to reduce CO2 emissions during economic growth
was predominantly derived using an ex-ante approach, such as the recent development of emissions
scenarios associated with alternative socio-economic developments (e.g., Shared Socioeconomic
Pathways (SSPs)) (42). Key parameters of the ex-ante analyses, such as the emissions outcome of
electrification, decarbonization and other energy system transformations, are commonly estimated
from energy engineering computations within IAMs (37, 43). However, ex-ante engineering
estimates can differ considerably from ex-post estimates of actual emissions and economic
outcomes (44). In this particular case, our analysis confirms and provides a crucial empirical basis
for the findings from ex-ante models that, without unprecedented transformations, few countries
can sustainably achieve economic growth while stabilizing or reducing their carbon emissions. Our
statistical approach can be used to form evidence-based explanations of the driving forces behind
emissions reductions in individual countries, and thereby complements other forms of analysis,
such as index decomposition approaches (45).

Our estimates of future emissions outcomes are based on historical patterns, assuming similar
future trends. Countries may reduce their future emissions, however, by deploying emerging CO2
abatement strategies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS).
According to recent IAM-based analyses, these technologies are essential for meeting the 1.5°C
target (38, 39). Emissions outcomes from economic development can also be altered if more
mechanisms are included, such as emission reductions by a shift from transport equipment to
intangible, knowledge-based assets, or emission reductions as a result of GDP losses in response
to warming (40).

Our empirical analyses are based on a strongly balanced panel data set that contains annual CO2
emissions and a variety of economic, energy-system, and temperature variables estimated for 70
countries over 44 years, from 1970 to 2013. CO2 emissions related to fossil-fuel combustion and
industrial processes are obtained from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research
(EDGAR v4.3.2) (26). Anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels have
been the main contributor to the rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere, and CO2 emissions are the
largest component of anthropogenic GHG emissions (46). The EDGAR inventory provides
comprehensive and consistent emission estimates over a long time series. Our data on GDP, capital
stocks, population, and human capital are from the Penn World Table (PWT) 9.0 (27). Value
added by sectors are collected from the United Nations National Accounts Main Aggregates
Database (47). Energy data is obtained from the International Energy Agency (IEA) (32). Climate
data for monthly average temperature are collected from the Climatic Research Unit Time-series
(CRUCY v3.23) (48).

Eq. 1 provides the overarching structure of the benchmark model. CO2 represents annual CO2
emissions related to fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes in a country/region. The level
of economic output is measured by GDP. For every unit of economic activity, Ω units of CO2 are
generated.

After omitting countries with short time series, each of the 70 countries kept in our sample has at
least 42 years of data for all variables used in our model. The only exception is Zimbabwe, for
which only 35 years of data are available. Iraq and Argentina are excluded from our sample due to
concerns about data reliability. The data set covers 82% of the CO2 emissions by fossil fuel
combustion and industrial processes, 87% of total primary supply, 80% of population, and 89% of
GDP in the world over 1970-2013. Detailed descriptions of the data set and country sample are
available in the Supplementary Information B1 and Table S2 a-b.

Methodologically, our model specification circumvents common challenges of endogeneity, nonstationarity, and cross-sectional heterogeneity that have undermined the estimation consistency in
many prior studies. By developing a two-equation simultaneous equation model (SEM, Eqs. 2-3)
and estimating it using three-stage-least-square estimator (3SLS), we ensure consistency of the
estimates threated by endogeneity – that GDP affects CO2 emissions could be in part because they
both depend on capital formation and technological changes. By specifying how CO2 emissions
are affected by growth-related and non-growth-related mechanisms while controlling for GDP
changes, we allow heterogeneous responses of CO2 emissions, across the countries, to the same
rate of economic growth. Given CO2 emissions and GDP are non-stationary (15, 49), we apply first
differencing to all variables (Eqs. 4-5). Results from a range of statistical tests indicate our model
circumvents or greatly alleviates several critical estimation problems related to the properties of
our analyzed data: non-stationarity, endogeneity, and cross-sectional correlation (Supplementary
Information C5).

Fig. S1 provides an illustration of our empirical framework. Below we explain the development of
the benchmark two-equation SEM describing CO2 emissions and GDP. Robustness checks using
alternative estimation procedures are explained in Supplementary Information C1-C4.
GDP (Eq. 2). Based on the one-sector augmented Solow model, economic output (GDP) is
produced via capital stock K, effective labor (human capital augmented labor, H·L), and
productivity or technological progress represented by total factor productivity TFP (50). Because
estimates of labor L (the product of number of persons engaged emp and average annual hours
worked by persons engaged avh) are unavailable for most developing countries, we use population
(Pop) as a substitute of labor in our model. The capital stock comprises different assets (Kc_*) that
may have different growth implications. Specifically, in PWT 9.0 (27), capital stock K is
disaggregated into four asset classes. Kc_Strucfr, Kc_Machfr, Kc_TraEqfr, and Kc_Intangfr
represent the fraction of structural assets (residential and non-residential), machinery (including
computers, communication equipment, and other machinery), transport equipment, and intangible
assets (including software, intellectual property products, and cultivated assets). Given the fractions
of the four assets sum up to unity, Kc_TraEqfr is dropped from Eq. 2 because its value will be
default when the values of other three are set. Since there are missing data for many countries for
total labor supply L in PWT 9.0, total population P is used instead. Other determinants of GDP are
captured by ε1, including country characteristics (e.g., political institutions, geography, and culture)
and common contemporaneous shocks (e.g., global financial crisis). They are not specified either
due to the lack of data or because they change very slowly and are considered as time-invariant.

(2)

Ω (Eq. 3). Emission intensity of the economy, Ω, depends on multiple growth-related and nongrowth-related forces that are observable and unobservable, x and ε2, respectively:
Ω = f(x,ε)= TFPα2 ∙ Hξ ∙ VA_Indω ∙ Kc_Strucfrδ2 ∙ Kc_Machfrλ2 ∙ Kc_Intangfrθ2
∙ TPES_FFfrρ ∙ TPES_coalFFfrφ ∙ TPES_oilFFfrϑ
∙ Electrificationσ ∙ Pl_engκ ∙ Opennessϵ ∙ Netimportfrζ
∙ Lowtempτ ∙ Hightempψ ∙ 𝑘𝑦𝑜𝑡𝑜 𝜒 ∙ 𝜀2

(3)

Growth-related factors. Firstly, the composition of the economic output matters for emission
intensity of the economy. The process of industrialization, which historically has been energyintensive, is regarded as an important driver for the increase of fossil CO2 emissions (6). In
comparison, the energy or CO2 implications of a growing service sector has been speculated but
there has been less certainty about its role (45). Industrialization is commonly represented by the
fraction of total value added (VA) by industrial activities, VA_indfr. To explore the emission
implications of the capital asset mix, we include the disaggregation of the capital stock in the
emission intensity equation, as we did in the GDP equation, Eq. 2. Besides economic
“composition,” Ω can be affected by the overall productivity or efficiency of economic production
represented by TFP and human capital H.
Energy system transformation and price level. Electrification (1, 37) and less carbon-intensive fuels
(25, 37, 45, 51) have been identified as the main reasons of falling energy intensity observed in
many countries. Here, we specify and estimate the effects of decarbonizing energy supplies by (1)

displacing fossil fuels by non-fossil fuels, (2) displacing coal and coal products by natural gas and
natural gas products, and (3) displacing oil and oil products by natural gas and natural gas products.
Three variables: TPES_FFfr (fraction of fossil fuels in total primary energy supply),
TPES_coalFFfr (fraction of coal and coal products in total fossil primary energy supply), and
TPES_oilFFfr (fraction of oil and oil products in total fossil primary energy supply) are used to
measure the decarbonizing processes. We define Electrification as the fraction of electricity in total
final energy consumption. Increases in energy prices may reduce emission intensity Ω by affecting
energy demand(45, 52, 53). We use the annual global energy price level obtained from (54) as a
proxy for the energy price signal. However, energy price signals are more heterogeneous across
times and countries. Unfortunately, such detailed information is unavailable for the temporal and
spatial coverage of our analysis.
Other non-growth factors. The trade-emission linkages have received considerable attention in
recent research, e.g., (18, 20). We test the emission effects of globalization and trade deficit (or
“outsourcing”) using two variables, Openness and Netimportfr, respectively. Openness measures
the total trade (imports plus exports) as a fraction of total GDP; Netimportfr is the ratio of net
import to GDP, representing a country’s trade balance. Low or high temperature may affect energy
demand and thus the emission intensity Ω. We use the lowest and the highest monthly average
temperature in a year (Lowtemp and Hightemp) to estimate the emission effects of winter warming
and summer warming, respectively. Ω may be affected by climate policy interventions. One of the
few interventions that are comparable across countries and have a long enough sample period is
the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which features common but differentiated emission reduction
commitments by developed and developing countries. We use a dummy variable to represent the
commitment of binding emission reduction targets by Annex B countries (kyoto =1 since year
2005; the Annex B countries are denoted in Supplementary Table S2). Other determinants of
emission intensity Ω are captured by ε2, including country characteristics (e.g., political institutions,
geography, and culture) and common contemporaneous shocks (e.g., global financial crisis). They
are not specified either because of a lack of data or because they change very slowly and are
considered time-invariant.
Using the 44-year longitudinal sample of 70 countries around the world, we take first differences
of the natural log of CO2, GDP, Pop, TPES, TFP, K, H, Pl_eng and first difference of Kc_Strucfr,
Kc_Machfr, Kc_Intangfr, VA_Indfr, Openness, Netimportfr, TPES_FFfr, TPES_coalFFfr,
TPES_oilFFfr, Electrification, Lowtemp, and Hightemp. Based on Eqs. 1-3, our benchmark twoequation SEM are (Eqs. 4-5):

A.1

A review of prior studies on CO2-GDP elasticity
Selected literature

We conducted an extensive literature review of quantitative empirical research that estimated
the CO2-GDP elasticity, published between 1990 and 2017. In the literature, CO2-GDP
elasticity is considered to represent the ‘net’ emission effect of economic growth, i.e., without
separately specifying the influence of other factors such as structural change, total factor
productivity, changes in the energy system, or similar factors. Based on this reduced-form
specification, prior estimates of CO2-GDP elasticity ranged widely, which have been
attributed to differences in country samples, data sources, as well as the neglect of
econometric problems that are essential for obtaining reliable empirical estimates. Emission
effects of other factors are also explored in some studies and treated as independent from
those of economic growth. Here, we selected 21 studies for a detailed review. Those studies
estimated CO2-GDP elasticity for a range of developed and developing countries and
represent publications at different time points between 1994 and 2017, including a number of
most widely-cited studies.

B. 2 A graphic illustration of the empirical framework
We specify and estimate main growth-related and non-growth-related factors that determine
CO2 emissions. An illustration of the empirical framework is provided in Fig. S1.
 Total factor productivity
(TFP) is a measure of the
overall technological
progress and productivity
of the economy

Common
contemporaneous shocks

Economic
efficiency

GDP

Capital
 Four asset classes: accumulation and
(residential and noncomposition
residential) structures,
machinery, transport
equipment, and intangible
assets (including software,
intellectual property products,
and cultivated assets)

Country
 Time-invariant or slowly evolving such as
characteristics
topography and political institution
Climate
CO2
 Such as the Kyoto Protocol, a binding
policy
emission reduction commitments by Annex B
Temperature

Industrial
structure

 Such as global financial crisis

Energy system
transition

 Sectoral composition of
economic outputs: agriculture,
industry, and service

countries (38 industrialized countries and
the European Community).

 Changes of the highest and the lowest monthly
temperature, respectively
 Decarbonization of primary energy supply by lowcarbon fuels; electrification

Robustness and generalizability of the main result

C. 1 Statistical results of the benchmark model
In the main manuscript (Table 1), only statistically significant empirical estimates removed
from the CO2 equation are presented. In Supplementary Table S4, statistical results of the
benchmark model, for both the CO2 and GDP equations are presented. Most country- and
year- fixed effects are not statistically significant so they are omitted from the table. For
variables included in Table 1, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) 95% confidence interval
are estimated from 1000 times’ bootstrap runs, which further validate the robustness of the
most crucial empirical relationships we recovered from the benchmark model and used in
later analyses.

C. 2 Various specification of the growth-related effects
Our estimates for the CO2-GDP elasticity and other emissions effects are robust to various
specifications of growth-related effects in the model (Supplementary Table S5), specifically
(1) adding 1-year lag of GDP growth rate to the CO2 equation
(2) adding 1-year and 2-year lags of GDP growth rate to the CO2 equation
(2) adding 1-year, 2-year and 3-year lags of GDP growth rate to the CO2 equation
(4) testing for asymmetric effects: GDP expansion vs. GDP recession in the CO2 equation
(5) using sample of OECD countries only
(6) using non-OECD countries only
(7) adding trade activities to the GDP equation

The main differences from the critical emission effects estimated using the benchmark model
and shown in Table 1 are highlighted in red.

analyses are consistently estimated by different model specifications, within the 95% CI
derived from the benchmark model. For developed countries, the statistical significance and
emission effects estimated for (de-)industrialization and natural gas decarbonization of oil are
both lower, suggesting their economic productions are less carbon-intensive and oil use more
efficient than those in developing countries.

Indirectly, we can derive a proportional CO2-GDP elasticity from Supplementary Table S6
(p<0.001). Estimates in the table are highly consistent with those derived from the
benchmark model (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Using primary energy supply to
bridge GDP and CO2, we can further elucidate the emission reduction mechanisms, i.e.
whether by affecting primary energy use or the emission intensity of energy supplies or

28

emissions from industrial processes. Those nuances are discussed in the main manuscript.
Although estimated at relatively low statistical significance level, trade openness (or
globalization) appears to reduce a country’s emissions by reducing its primary energy supply
while increase the emissions by increasing the carbon intensity of the energy supply or the
emissions from industrial processes. The two opposite emissions effects cancel each other
out.

C. 4 Alternative data sources and influence of cyclical variations
Overall, our main results are also robust to the usage of different data sources for CO2 and
GDP and the removal of cyclical variations (Supplementary Table S7), specifically:
(1) Using fossil-fuel CO2 emissions obtained from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
(60);
(2) Using real GDP estimates (in constant 2010 US dollars) obtained from (54)
(3) Using both alternative data sources in (1) and (2)
(4) Based on 5-year averages: averaging the original data in the panel data set of every 5-year
interval and take first differences of the transformed data set
(5) Based on 5-year averages: averaging the first differenced data

All estimates CO2-GDP elasticity in Supplementary Table S7 are not statistically different
from 1 (p<0.001). Most of the critical emission effects shown in Table 1 and used in later
analyses are maintained (within the 95% CI derived from the benchmark model). In
comparison to the main results from the benchmark model (Table 1), here, emission effects
of (de-)industrialization are estimated higher and electrification lower. Besides, the emission
effects of trade surplus and displacing oil by natural gas appear less certain.

C5. Testing for nonstationarity, serial correlation and cross-sectional
correlation
The presence of non-stationarity, serial correlation and cross-sectional correlation in panel
data models may lead to inconsistent estimates, or even spurious results. Accordingly, we
tested for those issues in our benchmark model using different methods, which are available
as commands in Stata/MP (55). We found no evidence of panel non-stationarity, which is
likely due to our first differencing approach. For most of the panel series in our data sample,
there is no evidence of autocorrelation (or serial correlation). We also found that our model
specification significantly reduced the extent of cross-sectional correlation.
Testing for panel non-stationarity. We ran a few panel non-stationarity tests using different
methods. Consistently, the results reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity in all panel
series. Table S8 shows the results of the Maddala and Wu (1999) and Pesaran (2007) tests,
carried out using the ‘multipurt’ command. multipurt performs 1st and 2nd generation panel
unit root tests for multiple variables and lags 1 (61).

Testing for serial correlation. We also tested for serial correlations. The Wooldridge test for
serial correlation in panel-data models has been widely used, available through Stata
command xtserial (62, 63) but it cannot be applied to a structural model, such as our
benchmark model. Thus we tested for autocorrelation for each of the 70 panel series in our
data sample using the C-H test, available through the Stata command ‘actest’ (64). Unlike
many other tests for serial correlations, the C-H test is still applicable when the model
contains endogenous repressors, which is our case. Out of the 70 panel series included in our
30

data sample, the null hypothesis of serial correlation, MA (1), exists in the residuals of the
CO2 model is rejected in most of them. The few exceptions are New Zealand, Mexico,
Morocco, and Ireland (p<0.05); Greece, Ecuador, China, Norway, Philippines, Malta, Iran
(0.05<p<0.1).
Testing for cross-sectional correlation. The Pesaran CD-test was employed here, using Stata
command “xtcd”. The results (Table S9) show very high average absolute correlation
coefficients for the data in log levels. The coefficients were greatly reduced in the first
differenced data and further reduced to a low level in the residuals of the benchmark model
(65).

Assessments of historical emission impacts

D. 1 Computing annual emission change and reduction
We use our data sample and the 9 statistically significant empirical relationships recovered
using the benchmark model (Table 1) to quantify the emission contributions made by the
already-observed trends of the 9 emission driving factors. As mentioned before, we bootstrap
the benchmark model 1000 times and obtained 1000 sets of estimates for the 9 empirical
relationships: β1, β2, β3, …, β1000, with βN being a 1×9 vector. xji,t represents the change of any
emission driving factor j observed in country i, year t. Thus, in country i, year t, factor j’s
contribution to annual emission change (𝐴𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝑁,𝑗 ) is computed as:
𝐴𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝑁,𝑗 = 𝛽 𝑁,𝑗 ∙ 𝑥 𝑗 i,t

(6)

For each emission driving factor j, we then calculate the median value of all 𝐴𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝑁,𝑗 (N=1,
2, 3, …, 1000) and obtained the 95% confidence interval to represent uncertainty range of our
sample. The median values of each of the nine factors are plotted as yellow lines in Fig. 2a,
left. To illustrate the distribution of the factors’ impacts on emission changes, they are plotted
in a “visually-weighted” fashion based on (66): darker areas represent values for which
emission changes were more common.

31

To illustrate the annual emission reduction (AER) effects of the emission disabling trends of
factor j (Fig. 2b, left), we only account for the emission reduction effect (Eq. 7). The median
values and uncertainty ranges are obtained and plotted as described above. The emission
reduction effects of GDP reductions are not accounted in the figure, since GDP reduction is
not considered as a desirable emission disabling pathway in this analysis.
𝐴𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 𝑁,𝑗 = 𝛽 𝑁,𝑗 ∙ 𝑥 𝑗 i,t

∀

𝛽 𝑁,𝑗 ∙ 𝑥 𝑗 i,t < 0

(7)

D. 2 Computing total emission change and reduction
The total emission changes contributed by the nine emission driving factors are plotted in Fig
2a, right. Factor j’s contribution to total emission change (𝑇𝐸𝐶𝑗 ) is computed as:
𝑇𝐸𝐶𝑗 = 𝛽 ∗,𝑗 ∙ ∑𝑡 ∑𝑖 𝑥 𝑗 i,t

(8)

𝛽 ∗,𝑗 is emission factor j’s regression coefficient in Table 1. The uncertainty ranges, illustrated
by the error bars in the figure, are calculated using the Bca (“bias-corrected and accelerated”)
95% bootstrap confidence interval (see Supplementary Table S4).
Similar to annual emission reduction (AER), total emission reduction (TER) of the emission
disabling trends of factor j (Fig. 2b, right) only account for the emission reduction effects:
𝑇𝐸𝑅 𝑗 = 𝛽 ∗,𝑗 ∙ ∑𝑡 ∑𝑖 𝑥 𝑗 i,t

∀ 𝛽 ∗,𝑗 ∙ 𝑥 𝑗 i,t < 0

(9)

Like TEC, the uncertainty ranges of TER are calculated using the Bca (“bias-corrected and
accelerated”) 95% bootstrap confidence interval (Supplementary Table S4) and illustrated by
error bars in the figure.

D. 3 Observed and computed desirable trends
There is a good agreement between the observed CO2 decline and the computed net CO2
reduction outcome during GDP growth. Such agreement is most notable for 14 advanced and
transition economies, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark,
Finland, France, United Kingdom, Iceland, Luxembourg, Poland, Sweden, and Uruguay,
where the computed outcomes of net emission reduction match repeated occurrences (≥10
years) of CO2 decline observed during years of GDP growth. While this is only illustrated for
three countries (Denmark, United Kingdom, and Poland) in Fig. 2d, it is presented for all 14
countries in Supplementary Fig. S2.

E

Explorations of climate-compatible economic growth rates

E. 1 Equations and assumptions
Assuming the future mimics the past, we calculate the GDP growth rates that are compatible
with stabilizing or declining CO2 emission rates based on our data set and the statisticallysignificant empirical relationship we derived from the benchmark model. The data set
represents plausible and internally-consistent dynamics of the economic and energy
developments. The use of the empirical relationships assumes future CO2 emissions are
influenced by those anthropogenic activities in a similar fashion as they were before. As
discussed in the manuscript, the climate change implications of winter warming and trade
surplus are less certain. Thus, in the further explorations, we only investigate how emissions

33

are shaped by seven factors: (1) GDP growth rate, (2) overall economic efficiency, (3)
deindustrialization, (4-6) three decarbonization pathways, and (7) electrification.
First, we obtain the emission impacts of factors (3)-(7), e1, in country i, year t:
𝑒1𝑖,𝑡 = ∑7𝑗=3 𝛽 ∗,𝑗 ∙ 𝑥 𝑗 i,t

(10)

Annual changes of GDP and TFP are related and such relation varies across country and
across time. For instance, in a country i, TFP increases by 2% and GDP grows by 3% in year
t; TFP increases by 2% and GDP grows by 2.2% in year t+1; and in the following year, TFP
increases by 3% and GDP decreases by 0.2%. We preserve the plausible and internallyconsistent GDP-TFP dynamics described by our data sample by computing the average TFP
growth rate associated with every 1% of GDP growth:
∆𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
∆ 𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡 =
⁄∆𝐺𝐷𝑃 ∙ 1%
𝑖,𝑡

(11)

Based on Eq. 11, we can calculate the net emission effects of factors (1) and (2) when GDP
grows by 1%, e2, in country i, year t:
𝑒2𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽 ∗,1 ∙ 1% + 𝛽 ∗,2 ∙ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
∆ 𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡

(12)

𝑑
The desirable GDP growth rate (𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡
) that allows for stabilizing or reducing CO2 emission
rate is then calculated:

𝑑
𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡
=

−𝑒1𝑖,𝑡
∙ 1%
𝑒2𝑖,𝑡

Eq. 11 represents a simplified construction of the GDP-TFP relationship. We only compute
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
∆ 𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡 when both ∆𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡 and ∆𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡 are positive as it makes the construction more likely
to be reasonable. If ∆𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡 and/or ∆𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡 are negative, the observation is considered a case
where simultaneous CO2 reduction and GDP growth is unlikely to be achieved. We also
exclude ∆𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡 outliers (when ∆𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖,𝑡 ⁄∆𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡 >2) from further analysis. In both cases, the
𝑑
desirable GDP growth rate (𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡
) that allows for stabilizing or reducing CO2 emission is
assumed to be “0”, making our analysis a conservative estimate of the climate-compatible
GDP growth rate.
𝑑
The percentile results presented in Fig. 3 are based on 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡
computed for all 2955 samples.
Detailed results for Fig. 3b-d are presented in the table below.
