Abstract: Recent studies have identified gendered citation gaps in political science journal
articles, with male scholars being less likely to cite work by female scholars in comparison to
their female peers. While journal editors, editorial boards, and political scientists are becoming
more aware of implicit biases and adopting strategies to remedy them, we know less about the
proper baselines for citations in subfields and research areas of political science. Without
information about how many women should be cited in a research field, it is difficult to know
whether the distribution is biased. Using the gender distribution of membership in professional
political science organizations and of article authors in 38 political science journals, we provide
scholars with baselines for gender representation in citations. We also show that women
represent a larger share of organization members than the authors in sponsoring organizations’
journals.
Keywords: political science, sociology of science, gender

How Many Citations to Women is “Enough”?
Estimates of Gender Representation in Political Science
Michelle L. Dion
Sara McLaughlin Mitchell
“I don’t want to read all this stuff, so would appreciate if someone could answer this
question for me: for those who argue too few women are cited, what is the normative
standard for the amount women should be cited? Is there some proportion they say is
right, or is the standard more nuanced than that?” – Natille’s [anonymous] response to
"Gender bias in citations" thread on poliscijobrumors.com (Natille [anonymous] 2018).

Recent political science studies have identified gendered citation gaps in journal articles (Dion,
Sumner and Mitchell 2018; Maliniak, Powers, and Walter 2013; Mitchell, Lange, and Brus
2013), with male scholars being less likely than their female peers to cite work by female
scholars. These findings may explain the underrepresentation of female authors in syllabi
(Colgan, 2017; Hardt et al 2017), edited volumes (Matthews and Andersen 2001), and textbooks
(Cassesse et al 2012). While many in the discipline are becoming more aware of implicit biases
and adopting strategies to remedy them, many political scientists, including the anonymous
author of the quote that opens this article responding to an online discussion about evidence of
gendered biases in citations (Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell 2018), want to how many citations to
work by women is “enough.” This is particularly important if journals begin adopting policies to
promote gender balance in citations (e.g., International Studies Review 2018), and we recognize
that some research areas within political science are more gender balanced than others. For
2

example, if an article on international security has 40% of its citations to female authors, is the
author sufficiently recognizing research contributions by women? While 40% of citations to
women might be reasonable in international security, 40% of citations to women in an article on
gender and politics would be biased, given much greater women’s representation in that area.
Without information about women’s representation in a specific research area, it is difficult to
know whether the distribution of cited authors is biased, even when calculating the gender and
racial breakdown of references (e.g., Sumner 2018).
Our study provides political scientists with estimates of women’s representation across a
wide range of research fields using the gender distribution in professional association
membership and authors in 38 political science journals. While other studies have discussed
gender across APSA member sections (Reid and Curry 2019) or authors in a much smaller
subset of journals (Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell 2018; Teele and Thelen 2017), we also compare
the gender distribution of authors to those of journal sponsor organizations, illustrating the size
of the gendered publication gap across a large number of research fields within political science.
In only one of 26 journals for which we also have membership data from the sponsoring section
or organization did the journal publish significantly more female authors than its membership. In
all other cases, women were equally or underrepresented among journal authors, suggesting that
membership may be a more useful baseline for publication and citation rates of work by female
scholars. We argue that scholars should consider gender representation in their research areas if
they want to minimize implicit biases in their citation practices.

Background Literature
Professional associations and the National Science Foundation (NSF) collect demographic
information (including gender) about awarded degrees and scholars in political science. Mitchell
and Hesli (2013) use NSF data to show declining percentages of women in the discipline as
ranks increase, noting that women constitute 40% of doctoral degrees in the field, but only 28%
of APSA members in 2009; a decade later it was still only 33.6% of members (APSA 2018).
These data accord with other estimates of women’s participation in professional associations
(Breuning and Sanders 2007). Similarly, Teele and Thelen (2017) note that women make up 27%
of faculty in the largest 20 PhD granting departments, 31% of APSA members, and 40% of PhDs
in political science. Hancock, Baum and Breuning (2013: 6) report that among ISA members,
20% of women are full professors, compared with 34% of men. These types of aggregate
disciplinary snapshots identify the population of female scholars in our profession, but they do
not identify nuanced differences across disciplinary subfields or narrow substantive areas of
interest, which often have significant variations in gender distributions.
A second approach for determining how many female scholars work in a research area
involves coding the sex of journal article or book authors in a discipline (Evans and Moulder
2011; Williams et al 2015). Breuning and Sanders (2007) find that women were only 21% of
article authors in eight political science journals (1999-2004), even though their representation in
APSA and ISA then exceeded 30%. Østby et al (2013) find that women authored or coauthored
23% of 947 articles in the Journal of Peace Research between 1983 and 2008. Teele and Thelen
(2017) note that around 35% of articles are authored or coauthored by women in ten political
science journals from 2000-2015 (N > 8,000 articles). Like aggregate membership data, these
snapshots of eight to ten political science journals are usually weighted toward general journals
4

that publish research from all subfields of political science, rather than narrower research topics
which may significantly deviate from aggregate, discipline-wide distributions.
Comparisons of organizational membership and published authors also reveals potential
gendered publication gaps if women’s representation as article authors is significantly less than
their presence in a field. Breuning and Sanders (2007) find that women are much less represented
in ISA journals than in ISA sections, while Teele and Thelen (2017) show that most political
science journals fail to publish a percentage of female authors similar to their APSA
representation (31%). Several processes could produce publication gaps, including: 1) the leaky
pipeline, or fewer women at senior ranks; 2) lower article submission rates of women compared
to men (Djupe, Smith, and Sokhey 2019; Hesli and Lee 2011); 3) the rise of co-authorship,
which benefits primarily male authors (Teele and Thelen 2017); and 4) gender biases in editorial
decision-making processes. A recent special section in PS: Political Science & Politics suggests
that there are no significant gender biases in editors’ decisions for five journals (Brown and
Samuels 2018), but the persistent gendered publication gap points to more pernicious sources,
like leaky pipelines and gendered co-authorship or submission rates. For example, Djupe, Smith,
and Sokhey (2019, figs. 2–3) find that men overall have authored more peer-reviewed articles
than women (Hesli and Lee 2011), but this difference is driven by significant differences
between men and women at associate professor rank. Nonetheless, existing studies fail to
provide insights into variations in publication gaps across topical research areas, which are also
indicative of potential biases in pipelines, co-authorship, or submission rates.

How Many Citations to Women is “Enough”?
The previous section suggests that we can think about gender balance in our bibliographies,
textbooks, syllabi, and speaker invitations by examining the representation of women in
professional organizations and their sections. The citation literature shows, though, that there are
implicit biases in citation decision-making. Men’s research can be viewed as more central or
important in a field (“Matthew” effect), while women’s work can be ignored or worse, attributed
to men in a field (“Matilda” effect) (Rossiter 1993). Even in fields like women in politics where
female scholars are a majority of all authors, male authors in Politics & Gender are still 14% less
likely than female authors to cite the work of women (Dion, Sumner and Mitchell 2018). While
recruitment and retention of more women can reduce citation gaps, we must raise awareness of
implicit biases in citation decisions. Put differently, gendered publication or citation gaps
between membership and authorship in related academic journals provide insights into research
areas where potential biases in pipelines, co-authorship, or submission rates remain significantly
large. In this regard, our data provide more nuanced information about relevant gendered
baselines for scholars who wonder whether they are missing research by women in their articles,
books, and syllabi as well as those who want to identify research areas in which gendered biases
in publication and citations may be most significant.

Gender Distribution of Faculty by Field and Organized Sections in APSA
We use APSA field and section membership to establish minimum baselines for the proportion
of references that should include female authors, similar to Reid and Curry’s (2019) use of
membership data to estimate progress toward descriptive representation across political science
research areas. If publications are an outcome potentially influenced by gendered practices,
6

professional association memberships may be less biased baselines because membership
involves fewer resources and gatekeepers. Nevertheless, membership figures can be genderbiased to the extent that women are more concentrated in non-R1 institutions with lower levels
of research support or less likely to have research funding.2 In 2018, of APSA members with
self-reported genders, 35.8% identified as female, 64.1% as male, and 0.1% as other genders (see
Table 1). If research productivity and publication processes are gender neutral, then journals that
publish work in all research areas, such as American Political Science Review or Perspectives on
Politics, should have one third of article authors and bibliography entries be female. Of course, if
women submit to journals at lower rates than men (Djupe, Smith, and Sokhey 2019) and if men
cite research by other men at higher rates (Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell 2018), then these
selection effects may result in gendered publication and citation gaps.
Membership in more specialized organizations, like APSA’s organized sections or
affiliated groups (e.g., Society for Political Methodology) represent a wide range of research
areas and the smallest relevant research communities for our analysis. Indeed, female APSA
members join organized sections at a significantly higher rate than male APSA members; 68.3%
of women belong to at least one section, while 64.1% of men do (Table 1, column 2: c2 =
18.277, p = 0.000). Female APSA members also belong to a significantly higher average number
of sections than men (Table 1, column 3: ANOVA, F = 21.73, p = 0.000). This is consistent with
women in political science being more oriented towards community building (Mitchell and Hesli
2013) as well as women having less specialized research trajectories and more interdisciplinary
research (Leahey 2006, 2007).

7

Table 2 presents the proportion of APSA members who self-identify as female by: a)
self-identified primary field of study, b) membership in organized sections, and c) in APSA
overall. We exclude those with no gender identity provided but include those who identified as
other genders. In 2018, significantly more women identified their primary research or teaching
field as public policy (41.4%) or comparative politics (39.3%) than the overall female
representation in APSA (35.8%) in 2018.3 In contrast, women are significantly underrepresented
among members who claim political philosophy and theory (31.6% female) or political
methodology (19.4% female). Other large fields, including international politics, American
politics, public administration, and public law/courts, have similar (e.g. not significantly lower)
female representation rates to overall APSA levels.
Organized section membership provides an even more detailed breakdown than primary
field of research areas because organized sections organize research panels at annual meetings,
sponsor specialized research conferences or journals, and recognize research contributions with
professional awards. The data are broadly consistent with prior research, which has noted, for
example, that women are more likely to study human rights (Maliniak, Powers, and Walter 2013)
and less likely to study methodology (Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell 2018; Shames and Wise
2017). Several research areas have female membership that significantly exceeds overall
representation in APSA, and in these areas (e.g. Race, Ethnicity, and Politics), a representative
bibliography would cite more than 35.8 % of works written by women. In a handful of areas (e.g.
legislative studies), women are significantly less represented than in APSA overall, and a
representative bibliography might have fewer works by women than female membership in
APSA. When political scientists compose course syllabi, graduate reading lists, or research

8

bibliographies, these membership data provide some guidance about the minimum representation
of scholarship by women that should be included to be representative by gender.

Gender Distribution of Authors by Journal
Using a methodology similar to previous studies (Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell 2018; Sumner
2018; Teele and Thelen 2017), we code the gender of the first five authors for a large sample of
38 political science journals, including all articles published between 2007 and 2016 by journals
sponsored by APSA organized sections and those of regional and international political science
associations.4 Figure 1 plots the female proportion of authors (with 95% confidence intervals) in
this sample alongside the female proportion of the journal’s sponsoring APSA section or
organization membership in 2017 or 2018, when available.5 The proportion of all authors who
are likely female vary from a high of 0.829 female authors in Politics & Gender to a low of
0.141 female authors in Political Analysis. Similar to the findings of Teele and Thelen (2017),
who found that women were underrepresented in high impact journals compared to the
profession, this figure illustrates the gap between recent membership and authorship across a
much larger number of research areas. In at least 13 journals, female authors are significantly
underrepresented compared to their membership in the sponsoring organization, and in no
instances are women “over” represented among authors, suggesting underlying gendered
practices as play. Indeed, these gendered publication gaps are often greatest in the highest status
journals that publish all subfields and research areas of political science (e.g., APSR, AJPS, or
JOP). These data cannot tell us why women are less represented as authors than as organization
members across such a wide range of general and narrow research areas. As explained earlier,
women might be less likely to submit their work or more likely to exit the discipline or
9

experience bias during the publication process. Therefore, as a measure of the supply of female
authors available to be cited, the proportion of authors that are female is a conservative estimate.
Previous research has also considered article author team composition ( Dion, Sumner,
and Mitchell 2018; Teele and Thelen 2017) , recognizing homophily effects in collaborations and
that collaboration is more common in some research areas. Therefore, we also coded the first
five authors of each article published in our sample as solo female, solo male, female team, male
team, or mixed gender team (see Appendix).6 Only in Politics & Gender and Journal of Race,
Ethnicity, and Politics do the percentage of solo female authored articles exceed that of solo
male authored articles and the percentage of female team authored articles exceed that of male
team authored articles. Both of these areas have high rates of female participation in the journal’s
sponsoring organization. If we consider journals in which the modal author team is collaborative
(not solo), the modal collaborative team is either all male or mixed gender, never all female.
Four journals (Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics, Journal of Experimental Political
Science, Public Opinion Quarterly, and Political Communication) have more mixed gender
author teams than other types of author configurations. Five journals (AJPS, PA, JCR, BJPS, and
JOP) have mostly male only collaborative author teams. This reflects tendencies both for women
to engage in fewer collaborative publications and to work in fields (like comparative politics)
where collaboration is less common.

Conclusion and Recommendations
Recent studies document gender gaps in citations in political science, yet we lack benchmarks
for how many female-authored works are enough for a representative bibliography across a wide
range of research areas. We remedy this gap by explicitly providing estimates of gender diversity
10

based on organization membership and journal article authorship that are conservative estimates
for evaluating gender representation. Instructors, researchers, and editors who want to ensure
references are representative can reference these as floors (rather than ceilings) for minimally
representative citations. However, our study does not evaluate scholars’ decisions to join
professional association sections or examine whether variance in gender representation among
sections reflects personal preferences, perceived section biases, or both. Our dataset simply
provides a benchmark, while recognizing that these unobserved factors influence scholarly
engagement with APSA and other associations.
Political scientists should reflect upon their own citation practices to ensure that their
references are consistent with gendered distribution of research in their area. Likewise, journal
editors can explicitly ask peer reviewers to consider whether article bibliographies are
representative, including the distribution of author genders. Some journals have gone further,
explicitly evaluating the gender balance of article bibliographies and encouraging authors to
remedy gendered citation gaps by providing additional space to do so (International Studies
Review 2018). APSA sections that sponsor journals should evaluate whether the publications
provide ample descriptive representation of section members. In addition, those that select
journal editorial teams should pay attention not only to the diversity of the editorial team, but
also their plans for addressing potential citation biases. Luckily, tools like the GBAT (Sumner
2018) help political scientists quickly and easily evaluate gender balance in their bibliographies.
Over time, as the discipline becomes more gender balanced across research areas, these
estimates will need to be updated and adjusted. Finally, while we have focused here on gender
diversity (and particularly cis-gender identities), future research and recommendations should

11

consider racial or ethnic diversity as well as intersectional identities to ensure that research by
underrepresented groups is referenced adequately in political science teaching and research.

Notes
1

We are grateful to Yanna Krupnikov for comments on an earlier version of this project.

2

In the 2004 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (N=26,100), women constituted 42.5% of

all respondents but only 36.5% of public doctoral and 34.6% of private doctoral degree granting
institutions, showing that women are less represented in R1 institutions (National Center for
Education Statistics 2019). This suggests that the data we analyze may underestimate women’s
representation in the discipline if such institutions provide fewer resources on average for joining
professional associations.
3

Here we consider differences significant if the 95% confidence interval for the female

proportion of a field’s members does not include the overall proportion of female APSA
members.
4

We used the Genderize.io API, which generates a predicted probability that a first name is used

by someone who identifies as male or female based on millions of social media profiles. We
code names as male or female if the predicted probability is equal to or greater than 0.8. Teele
and Thelen (2017) found that Genderize.io has a 2% error rate. Years vary because some
journals were founded since 2007; see Appendix for years included in sample by journal.
5

The overall female proportion of APSA is plotted for its three flagship journals, APSR,

Perspectives on Politics, and PS: Political Science and Politics. Membership data as of 2017 for
the International Political Science Association (sponsor of IPSR) from Abu-Laban, Sawer, and
St-Laurent (2017), for the Midwest Political Science Association (sponsor of AJPS) from
Morgan (2018), for the Southern Political Science Association (sponsor of JOP) from Howard
(2018). The Western Political Science Association (sponsor of PRQ) does not track members’
21

genders. Membership information was also requested from the leadership of the Northeastern
Political Science Association (sponsor of Polity), International Studies Association (sponsor of
ISQ), the American Association for Public Opinion Research (sponsor of POQ), and Peace
Science Society (sponsor of JCR).
6

Articles with at least one male and one female author are coded as mixed, even if authors’

genders are incomplete. Male and female only require that all authors’ genders be coded.
Missing cases occur when some gender authors are missing and coded authors are all the same
gender.

Estimating Women’s Representation with APSA Survey Data
In addition to estimating the distribution of women in research fields using APSA section membership,
we can also calculate gender representation using two recent APSA membership surveys. The first wave
of the APSA survey included a sample of 1,399 APSA members from the population of 5,179 APSA
members, stratified by department size and surveyed in early fall 2009 (Mitchell and Hesli 2013; Hesli,
Lee, and Mitchell 2012; Hesli and Lee 2011). The second wave drew a new 1,051 APSA member
sample from the 2009 population file, and respondents answered surveys during late fall 2014 and early
winter 2015 (Claypool et al. 2017). The proportion of women answering the survey increased from
24.9% of respondents in 2009 to 39.2% in 2014-15.1 Figure A1 illustrates the gender distribution of
APSA members in the surveys overall and according to members’ major field of PhD study and primary
field of research and teaching in 2009 and in 2014. Major PhD field has a fixed list of responses,
including American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, Theory, Methods, and Other.
The surveys also use an open-ended question to ask about a respondent’s primary research and teaching
field, which is re-coded to mirror the PhD major field response options (e.g., general political science,
political behavior, political economy were recoded to “other”).
Across the major and primary fields, women’s representation increased between the two waves.
In 2014-15, among respondents who identified Comparative Politics, Political Theory, or other fields as
the major field in their PhD program, more than 40% are female respondents. Among respondents who
identified American Politics or International Relations as their major field, 36.5% and 32.1% are female.
In both waves of the survey, only three respondents reported Methods as their major PhD field, and one
of these identified as female in the first wave, none in the second. When asked their primary field of
teaching and research, more than 40% of respondents in American and Comparative Politics identified
as female in 2014-15. In contrast, women are only 34.8% and 38.3% of those working primarily in IR or
Political Theory, respectively. Of the 16 respondents who identify Methods as their primary teaching
and research field in 2014-15, only one is female (6.3%). While the proportion of female APSA survey
respondents vary by major and primary fields, the 95% confidence intervals for all major and primary
fields except Methods overlap with the overall proportion of women in the survey (39.2%).

Gender responses included male, female, and transgender, but only a handful of survey respondents
selected transgender, thus we compare males and females in our analyses.
