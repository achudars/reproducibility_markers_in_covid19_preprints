Abstract: Herding can be characterized as a coordination game with two strategies for minimising

10

risk: increase herd size (livestock quantity) or increase livestock body mass (livestock quality). In this

11

paper I demonstrate that the selection of herd maximisation as a risk management strategy in the

12

Northern parts of Norway has been influenced by a history of intra-group competition exacerbating

13

between-herder conflict and lack of trust. In the South herder-farmer conflicts have increased

14

between-herder coordination and trust; resulting in the adoption of increasing livestock quality as

15

the dominant risk management strategy.

INTRODUCTION

20

The debate pertaining to reindeer husbandry in Norway is characterised by two contrasting views.

21

On one hand, there is the prevailing view of overstocking: the Office of the Auditor General of

22

Norway has suggested that a large part of the pastures in Northern parts of Norway (Finnmark) is

23

overused: in 2009 >50% of the lichen cover was overgrazed and ~40% was reduced (Office of the

24

Auditor General 2012). Furthermore, in 2010 a news story reported that reindeer where starving to

25

death on the way to winter pastures (Aslaksen and Måsø 2010). During this time reindeer should,

26

however, be in good condition because they should have gained body mass during summer (cf.

27

Bårdsen et al. 2010). Previously, starvation mainly occurred during harsh spring/early summer

28

(Hausner et al. 2011) when reindeer were in poor condition because they lose body reserves during

29

the winter season (cf. Bårdsen 2017). Consequently, the primary objective of reindeer husbandry

30

management policies in Norway is to achieve ecological, economic and cultural sustainability

31

(Ulvevadet 2012). While sustainability is loosely conceptualised, policies are—for all practical

32

purpose—concerned with one thing only: namely that of reducing the number of reindeer.

33

On the other hand, Benjaminsen et al. (2015), argues that the current debate of overstocking

34

and overuse represents a misreading of the Arctic landscape. Rather, the debate perpetuates a

35

dominant crisis narrative that functions as a myth, meaning as “… an enduring ‘social fact’, whose

36

narrative reality is in large part decoupled from its supposed scientific basis” (Benjaminsen et al.

37

2015:228). This narrative, it is argued, affects policies and fails to incorporate both alternative

38

scientific evidence and interpretations in line with non-equilibrium ecology (i.e. livestock and

39

pastures are limited by external factors such as climate, cf. Næss 2013, Little et al. 2001). For

40

Benjaminsen et al. (2015:223) the overstocking debate is flawed because a non-equilibrium system is

41

a system “…where herbivore populations fluctuate randomly according to external influences, [and]

42

the concepts of carrying capacity and overgrazing have no discernible meaning”.

43

44

The importance of a comparative perspective

45

The overstocking and non-equilibrial view is, however, limiting because it equates reindeer herding in

46

Norway with reindeer herding in Finnmark. While Finnmark contain >70% of Norway’s Saami

47

reindeer herders, it is not necessarily representative for reindeer herding in Norway. Finnmark

48

(hereafter: North) can be characterized by increasing reindeer abundance and low proportion of

49

slaughter (as well as low carcass body mass). South-Trøndelag/Hedmark (hereafter: South) is, in

50

contrast, characterized by a relatively stable abundance, high proportion of slaughter and high

51

carcass body mass (Figure 1, see Appendix A for details). Surprisingly, important natural conditions

52

are similar since both regions have access to winter pastures with cold, stable and favourable climate

53

(Tveraa et al. 2007).

54

A pertinent question is thus why—if fluctuations in abundance in the North is natural and

55

just a characteristic of a non-equilibrium system (Benjaminsen et al. 2015)—has the abundance in

56

the South been comparatively stable (Figure 1)? Or, as Riseth (2000) asks: why is it the case that an

57

area having the best conditions for reindeer in Norway, with safe and stable lichen pastures, is

58

exposed to the most serious problems?

59

The contrast between the North and South can only be understood by a historical

60

comparative analysis focusing on how different historical perturbations have resulted in different

61

outcomes. I will demonstrate that in the North, the most significant historical perturbation has been

62

related to border closings cutting across and contracting important and established trans-national

63

migration routes and grazing areas. In the South, it has been an expanding and a favoured

64

agricultural sector, encroaching upon traditional reindeer areas. In effect, competition with respect

65

to decreasing pasture areas has characterised the history of both the North and the South.

66

Nevertheless, competition in the North has been, and still is, between different groups of herders (or

67

individual herders, i.e. intra-group) while in the South it has been (and still is) between herders and

68

farmers (i.e. inter-group). Viewing reindeer herding as a coordination game with two Nash equilibria
3

69

for managing risk: (1) maximising quantity (i.e. livestock numbers or herd size) and (2) maximising

70

livestock quality (i.e. increasing livestock body mass), I will demonstrate that intra-group competition

71

has led to the adoption of (1) in the North while inter-group competition has led to the adoption of

72

(2) in the South.

73
74

REFRAMING NOMADIC PASTORALISM AS A COORDINATION GAME

75

The management policies in Norway rest on the understanding that reindeer herding can be

76

characterised as a ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ (Hardin 1968). As Hardin (1968) observed, ‘Prisoner’s

77

Dilemma’ problems occur in many, if not most, situations that call for collective sacrificial restraint or

78

action (Wydick 2008). For example, individual conservation of common-pool resources, such as

79

forests, fisheries, and grazing lands, typically yields a total public benefit compensating everyone for

80

his/her own restraint. Nevertheless, there is an inherent social dilemma because the underlying

81

incentive rest on gaining and individual advantage through a lack of individual restraint (Wydick

82

2008).

83

In contrast, I will argue that herding is better conceptualized as a coordination game where

84

players have common interests: benefits accrue to individuals through collective action and

85

individuals are better off cooperating (Alvard and Nolin 2002). The problem is, however, that of

86

coordination: the assurance game used as a starting point here has two Nash equilibria 1—both

87

cooperate or both defect—but only one Pareto optimal solution 2 (both cooperate, Alvard and Nolin

88

2002) whereas a Prisoner’s Dilemma has only one Nash equilibrium (both defect, Figure 2).

1

No player can do better by choosing another strategy if the other player(s) continue to pursue the already selected

strategy (McCain 2003).
2

A state of affairs is Pareto-optimal (or Pareto-efficient) if and only if there is no alternative state that would make some

people better off without making anyone worse off (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pareto-optimality).

89

Following Dyson-Hudson (1977), the ultimate goal of pastoralists is the survival of the

90

pastoralist and his/her family. Any proximate goal must thus be viewed with reference to the

91

ultimate goal of survival. For nomadic pastoralists, herd accumulation is an efficient strategy for

92

buffering environmental variation since herders with large herds have comparable larger herds from

93

one year to the next compared to those with smaller herds. Furthermore, during crisis periods

94

herders with large herds before a collapse also have the largest herds after the collapse (cf. Næss and

95

Bårdsen 2010, Næss and Bårdsen 2013, Næss and Bårdsen 2015, Næss et al. 2011). In short, herd

96

maximisation is a proximate goal that have a positive effect on the ultimate goal of long-term

97

household survival or viability. Nevertheless, it could be argued that the best risk management

98

strategy is to increase livestock body mass and not herd size because it offsets the effects of density-

99

dependence 3 (cf. Næss and Bårdsen 2010, Næss and Bårdsen 2015) and while herd accumulation has

100

been found to be efficient it is also costly (Næss and Bårdsen 2013). Herding can thus be heuristically

101

conceptualized as a two-person coordination game where the decision is to buffer risk through (1)

102

increased herd size (quantity) or (2) increased livestock body mass (quality, i.e. not increasing herd

103

size but livestock body mass). In effect, a decision between maximising livestock quantity or quality.

104
105

Norms as coordination devices

106

In a coordination game with two and more Nash equilibria players can have difficulties deciding on

107

which equilibrium to choose. If some clue can lead the participants to believe that one equilibrium is

108

more likely to be realized than the other, the more likely equilibrium is called a Schelling point (or

3

High reindeer abundance results in smaller animals that are more vulnerable to unfavourable conditions (cf. Bårdsen

2017) as they are most likely to die of food limitation (Tveraa et al. 2003). In general terms, reindeer are limited by how
both environmental conditions (climate) and negative density dependence affect body mass: small individuals are: (1) less
likely to reproduce; (2) give birth later; (3) produce less viable offspring prone to starvation and predation; and (4) affects
adult survival negatively (cf. Bårdsen 2017).

5

109

focal point, McCain 2003). Schelling (1980) argued that it is the salience or prominence of focal

110

points that draws people to them, and that what is prominent depends on the time and place and

111

who the players are, i.e. it is a belief increasing the probability of one equilibrium occurring rather

112

than the other (McCain 2003, see also Sugden 2005). For Alvard (2003), focal points can be

113

conceptualised as norms—understood as regularities of behaviour maintained through shared ideas

114

of right and wrong. Norms can thus be viewed as a way in which coordination is more easily achieved

115

(see also Ensminger and Knight 1997). Following Sugden (2005 149 & 162), norms can be viewed as

116

conventions of coordination—e.g. ‘keep left’ (or ‘keep right’) which evolve out of repeated play of

117

games of coordination—that are likely to acquire moral force or become principles of natural law.

118

For Alvard and Nolin (2002), norms reduces transaction costs 4 and provide assurances of

119

satisfactory payoffs to participants. Cultural transmission of norms can thus be viewed as the

120

“pregame” communication crucial for achieving the best outcome (Alvard and Nolin 2002:522).

121

Among whale hunters in Lamelera, for example, meat distribution follows a complex set of norms.

122

Alvard (2003) argues that while a hunter should be indifferent to which norm is used, it is critical that

123

all the hunters share the same norms for butchering and distribution. In its absence, transaction

124

costs for resolving harvest claims would skyrocket and cooperative behaviour would most likely

125

collapse (Alvard 2003). Norms thus have a self-reinforcing function: everyone wants to play their part

126

with the expectations that others will do the same (Young 2003).

127

4

Transaction costs can be defined as costs in relation to: (1) search costs – i.e. identifying possibilities for cooperation; (2)

bargaining costs – i.e. agreeing on one form of cooperation rather than another; and (3) monitoring and enforcement costs
– i.e. ensuring that the cooperation of other members is enforced (Mearns 1996, see also Alvard and Nolin 2002).

6

128

Cultural group selection and the evolution of norms

129

Gurven (2004) argues that norms among foragers eliminates the collective action problem of, for

130

example, group food production. Nevertheless, enforcing norms is a second-order collective-action

131

problem (Smith 2004). One theoretically viable solution is, according to Smith (2004), cultural or

132

genetic group selection because cooperation within groups can evolve when groups compete (Brooks

133

et al. 2018).

134

Competition, between culturally different groups, has been argued to shape normative

135

content (Boyd et al. 2018). Group norms and values could affect the probability of a group’s survival,

136

whether a group is economically successful or expanding or is imitated by its neighbours (Boyd and

137

Richerson 2009). Groups with more successful cultural traits are thus more likely to pass those traits

138

to the next generation (Zefferman 2018). In short, inter-group competition is an important factor for

139

spreading pro-social or cooperative norms and inter-group competition can thus shape cultural

140

evolution (Henkel 2018, Francois et al. 2018). Turchin (2007:6) argue that in environments

141

characterised by intense between-group competition “… poorly integrated groups crumble and

142

disappear, whereas groups based on strong cooperation thrive and expand”. The domination of one

143

group over another is made possible because groups are integrated by cooperation (Turchin 2007).

145

REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF REINDEER HERDING IN NORWAY

146

Reindeer herding in the North: A brief history

147

Up until 1933 reindeer herding in the North was regulated differently than the rest of Norway and

148

held a special position (for details, see Appendix A). According to Holand (2003) during the end of the

149

18th century and beginning of 19th, the government had a more positive attitude towards the

150

reindeer husbandry in the region. Thus, Saami herders from Kautokeino and Karasjok extended their

151

winter migrations far into the forests of present-day Finland while at the same time herders from

152

parts of Northern Finland had summer pastures on the Norwegian side of the border.
7

153

In 1852 the border between Finland and Norway was closed for reindeer (Holand 2003) and

154

thus limited Norwegian Saami access to Finnish grazing areas (Marin 2006). Accordingly, the life of

155

the Saami herders became difficult: not only had the winter pastures in Finland become unavailable,

156

but the lichen pastures on the Norwegian side deteriorated due to intensive use (NOU 1994). The

157

border between Sweden and Finland continued to be open for reindeer and several families

158

migrated to Sweden—where some even became Swedish citizens—to continue to access Finnish

159

winter pastures. The influx of “Norwegian” Saami displaced “Swedish” Saami; who had to move

160

further down south in Sweden (Holand 2003).

161

Subsequently, a new pattern of usage had to be established and the first regulations came in

162

1853 (Holand 2003). It was seasonal in nature whereby it was no longer allowed to graze reindeer in

163

Inner Finnmark during summer. Due increasing conflicts between herders from Kautokeino and

164

Karasjok they were allocated exclusive winter pasture areas and in 1871 a ‘buffer’ zone between

165

them was also established (Figure A1).

166

In 1889 the border between Finland and Sweden was closed for reindeer herding.

167

Subsequently, several of the Kautokeino Saami who originally emigrated to Sweden moved back to

168

Norway (Aarseth 1989:74). In 1888 another law regulated pasture use further: summer pastures

169

were distributed between Kautokeino, Karasjok, Polmak and Varanger (Aarseth 1989). Moreover,

170

this distribution re-allocated the previous ‘buffer’ zone between Kautokeino and Karasjok to

171

Kautokeino (Holand 2003, Aarseth 1989).

172

The Reindeer Husbandry Law of 1933 opened for a district division in the North. Finnmark

173

county was, however, divided not only into district but also into parishes (Norwegian: ‘reinsogn’,

174

Marin and Bjørklund 2015). In 1934 the County Governor in Finnmark finalised the distribution of

175

pastures through e.g. dividing summer pastures into separate districts as well as common spring and

176

fall pastures in Finnmark (Holand 2003, Marin and Bjørklund 2015, see Figure A2).

8

177

In West-Finnmark the number of reindeer fluctuated around 40 000 until the 1970s but by

178

1990, the number had increased to about 110 000. According to Marin (2006) the increasing

179

abundance in the North was caused by the mechanisation process in the mid-1960s and the

180

introduction of governmental subsidies. Holand (2003) argues that the post-war social changes in the

181

North changed the migratory pattern and resulted in gradual sedentarisation of herders (Riseth and

182

Vatn 2009). Moreover, Holand (2003) argues that by the end of the 1970s the introduction of

183

modern technology; a cash economy; and the relatively large sums of money paid by the government

184

had weakened the traditional use of autumn and winter pastures. At the same time, the number of

185

herders increased (see Appendix A for details).

186

During the 1980s between-siida conflicts increased and traditional siida-borders were

187

challenged (Holand 2003 200, Marin 2006). Holand (2003) attributes the increasing conflict level to

188

the fact that expansive siidas opportunistically argued that the district designation as of 1934 had

189

designated autumn and winter pastures as ‘commons’ (Marin 2006, argue that this designation co-

190

occurred with the 1978 Act). Traditionally, long-enduring use of specific pasture areas established

191

reciprocally accepted rights in space and time; but there was rarely full exclusivity as siida areas to

192

some extent overlapped. Paine (1994 figure 5.7) argues, for example, that while herds graze on

193

physically separated areas during summer, during winter, pastures constitute an overlapping quilt.

194

Neighbours were usually well informed of traditions and rights, knowing under which conditions the

195

use of others’ pastures could be acceptable (Riseth and Vatn 2009). By designating winter and

196

autumn pastures as ‘commons’ a de facto situation of open access to winter pastures was created

197

(Marin 2006). Marin and Bjørklund (2015:23-4) argues

198
199

“It was the first time a legal text implied that any existing divisions between groups were

200

superseded, indeed that the ‘traditional’ way of managing these territories was some sort of

9

201

collective (felles) use that gave equal rights to individuals by virtue of their simple

202

membership to an undefined collective”

203
204

As Holand (2003) points out: a siida that wish to expand must extend its grazing area. But an

205

expansive siida will eventually meet other herders and siidas and thus trigger conflicts with respect

206

to traditional use (unless the other party withdraws). This expansive strategy was used by the so-

207

called ‘inner’ siidas/districts (i.e. siidas/districts that are closer to the autumn and winter pastures

208

and thus are at the front of the queue for the fall migration): from 1980 to 1990 they increased their

209

herds by an average of 130% while the ‘outer’ district (i.e. coastal and island districts) only increased

210

by 38% (Riseth and Vatn 2009:98).

211

Territorial expansion of one siida will often be considered as trespassing by other siidas

212

(Marin and Bjørklund 2015). This again might sever relations with neighbouring siidas and bring

213

about sanctions, spanning from withholding information to slaughtering of the most valuable

214

females (Riseth and Vatn 2009, see also Paine 2009). At the same time, herders accept that “lucky”

215

reindeer owners experiencing increased herd size need larger pastures. This is, however, constrained

216

by an important caveat: expansion should not take place at the expense of the original users (Marin

217

and Bjørklund 2015). With the designation of winter pastures as “commons”, accusations of

218

encroachment became prevalent (Marin and Bjørklund 2015).

219

Not surprisingly, Hausner et al. (2012) found that in the North there is a low level of trust and

220

cooperation between siidas. This is especially evident on the winter pastures where 52% of the

221

respondents (n = 74) are suspicious toward their neighbours, and only 19% reports a strong degree of

222

trust towards their neighbouring herdsmen (Hausner et al. 2012:4). In contrast, on summer pastures

223

trust is high: most summer pastures are managed by one siida whose members have strong family

224

ties with a long history of collaboration (Hausner et al. 2012:4).

10

225

Marin (2006), argues that by individualizing reindeer herding through legal permits vested in

226

individual herders the cooperative nature of reindeer herding became eroded. Through the reindeer

227

licence “… herders did not need the approval of the herding community at large anymore and could

228

pursue their own interests” (Marin 2006:217). While Paine (2009:123) argues “… that inter-camp

229

[siida] are the loci of changing, and at times uneasy, combinations of trust and suspicion”, the

230

introduction of the reindeer license could result in an erosion of trust between members of the same

231

siida.

232

A case in point is the example of the young reindeer herder Jovvset Ante Sara. 5 In short, the

233

Norwegian Government has demanded that he must reduce the number of reindeer from 116 to 75

234

animals (35% Hætta 2018). The case has traversed the Norwegian court system for several years,

235

ending with the Supreme Courts adjudicating in the favour of the Norwegian Government on the 21st

236

of December 2017 (Larsen 2018).

237

While one could argue that the demand is unreasonable—because of the apparent

238

difficulties with making a living of just 75 reindeer 6—this case seems to have been influenced by

239

within-siida/district coordination issues: originally it was the district that was tasked with reducing

240

the number of reindeer (from 3105 to 1700, Larsen 2018). The problem was, however, that individual

241

herders in the district failed to agree upon how to distribute the reductions among themselves.

242

Subsequently, everyone within the district was ordered to reduce their number by 35% (Hætta 2018,

243

Larsen 2018). To put the whole thing in perspective: in 2013, 231 siida-shares had received requests

244

of reductions—sent out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food—and by 2019 everyone had

245

complied, except Sara (Nordvåg 2019).

5

A case that has had international coverage e.g. in the New York Times in 2018

(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/world/europe/reindeer-norway-sami.html).
6

Sara has submitted his case to the European Court of Human Rights because of this (Nordvåg 2019)

11

246

In sum, the history of reindeer herding in the North demonstrates that the most significant

247

historical constraint on reindeer herding has been related to border closings cutting across and

248

contracting important and established trans-national migration routes and grazing areas. This has

249

again been translated to increased conflict between herders or groups of herders, i.e. increased

250

intra-group competition (Figure 3; see Appendix A for more details).

251
252

Reindeer herding in the South: A brief history

253

While a district division was not formalised in the North until Reindeer Husbandry Law of 1933, in the

254

South, districts were established by Royal Resolution as early as in 1894 (Fjellheim 1999). The main

255

aim of this was to protect farmers from damages incurred by reindeer, in effect the aim was not to

256

provide herders with grazing rights but rather to provide stronger control while at the same time

257

ensuring damage compensation for the sedentary population (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013). Thus, in

258

the South there has been a long history of herder-farmer conflicts and where the main issue has

259

been an expanding agricultural sector.

260

In 1794 & 1801, for example, Saami herders wrote complaints to the county pointing out that

261

farmers were trespassing on their traditional summer grazing areas (Fjellheim 1999). Furthermore,

262

the complaints indicate that farmers had both threatened and done violence to herders; threatened

263

to kill their reindeer; and stolen Saami property (Fjellheim 1999). While the Saami got their stolen

264

property back, Fjellheim (1999) writes that farmers were not punished for their misdeeds in neither

265

1794 nor 1801 (see Appendix A for details).

266

Rather than punishing the farmers, herders were punished for illegal grazing (Fjellheim

267

1999). In the aftermath of the complaints, five farmers raised a lawsuit against the Saami because

268

their reindeer had ‘damaged their summer farms and hayfields’ in 1875, 1876 and 1877 (Fjellheim

269

1999:127). After 15 years, a final verdict was reached by the Supreme Court on the 7th of April 1892.

270

The Saami herders lost the case and were sentenced to pay for damages incurred during the
12

271

aforementioned years (Fjellheim 2007). Just five years later, in 1897, another Supreme Court verdict

272

bluntly stated that ‘research has shown that the rights of farmers are older than that of the Saami’

273

(Fjellheim 2007:138).

274

The underlying cause of the conflicts was expanding farming. In general, already established

275

farms had summer mountain pastures/summer farms in nearby areas. After a while, they became

276

permanent farms that again required their own summer farms and areas for haymaking and so on

277

(Fjellheim 1999). These again were often established in traditional Saami summer areas because the

278

fertile reindeer milking sites 7 provided good sites for haymaking and were thus excellent locations for

279

the establishment of new farms (Fjellheim 1999).

280

During the Second World War and its aftermath the reindeer in the South became, according

281

to Holand (2003), more or less wild. During the war, herders let the reindeer so that the Germans

282

couldn’t slaughter them (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013). Post-war, the distribution of unmarked

283

reindeer became contentious: herders struggled with control and unmarked reindeer often migrated

284

outside of the official district borders (Skjenneberg and Slagsvold 1968). Subsequently, the County

285

Governor declared previous reindeer herding areas as wild reindeer areas where hunting was

286

allowed (Holand 2003). This increased the level of tensions between herders and landowners, and

287

even within the reindeer district borders hunting of un-herded reindeer was allowed. According to

288

Gundersen and Rysstad (2013), reindeer herding in the South was not brought under control until

289

the 1970s. Thus, from the end of the Second World War until the 1970s the prevailing view was that

290

reindeer herding was on the brink of collapse (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013, Holand 2003).

291
292

In the 1960s herders and representatives from the county of South-Trøndelag met to try to
rectify the situation. They agreed upon joint operation lead by a board consisting of two herders and

7

Farmers coveted traditional reindeer milking sites because reindeer droppings fertilised the areas making them ideal for

cultivating hay and grass (Fjellheim 1999).

13

293

a chairman, appointed by the County Governor (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013). The herders accepted

294

official oversight and control. Herders took an active role with the hope that conditions would

295

improve so that the reindeer husbandry could be developed further (Holand 2003). Consequently,

296

during the 1960s the reindeer husbandry improved, and the number of reindeer increased (Holand

297

2003).

298

As the reindeer husbandry improved, new herders established themselves and the number of

299

reindeer increased. But, in contrast to the North, herders managed to agree upon maximum number

300

of reindeer within the districts, because herders with large herds were willing to reduce herd size

301

(Holand 2003). This was not without challenges since herders had to come to terms with how many

302

families the number of reindeer should be distributed amongst: multigenerational businesses got a

303

bit more animals, while single herders had to settle for fewer (Holand 2003). Furthermore, conflicts

304

with landowners convinced herders that a close collaboration was necessary for developing the

305

reindeer husbandry in the area. A fair—or at least an agreed upon—distribution of animals between

306

families was decisive for fruitful internal collaboration (Holand 2003).

307

Pressure from farmers increased during the 1970s and 1980s. At this time, he cultivation of

308

new land took place within reindeer herding areas (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013) and to deal with

309

this efficiently it was important to establish a common front vis-à-vis an expanding agricultural sector

310

(Holand 2003). A contentious issue was, for example, that herders were, by law, required to stop

311

reindeer from encroaching on cultivated fields. It was thus the herders’ obligation to fence in newly

312

cultivated areas and they were liable for (alleged) damages incurred by reindeer (Gundersen and

313

Rysstad 2013).

314

Through several trials during the 1970s and 1980s, and more recently in 1997, herders in the

315

South have lost grazing areas (Holand 2003). For example, the ‘Korsøfjell-verdict’ from 1988 centred

316

around to what extent herders had rights to winter pastures in the Femund area. The Supreme

317

Court’s verdict in the ‘Aursund-verdict’ of 1997 concerned a disputed area in Røros municipality.
14

318

Herders from one district was sued by 27 landowners with respect to illegal grazing on arable land. In

319

the ‘Korsøfjell-verdict’, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favour of the landowners,

320

concluding that a reindeer herding district is not the same as a reindeer pasture area (Gundersen and

321

Rysstad 2013). The Supreme Court found in the ‘Aursund-verdict’, as in the Korsøfjell verdict, that in

322

the specific area—within a designated Saami reindeer herding area—a right to practice reindeer

323

herding was not established (Anonymous 2002). In effect, the verdicts opened for a somewhat

324

paradoxical situation whereby Saami herders could lose their right to herd reindeer within a

325

designated reindeer husbandry area, i.e. districts (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013).

326

This pattern of favouring landowners was, however, to change with the “Selbu-verdict” from

327

2001 (Anonymous 2002). Concerning itself with the extension of the right to herd reindeer on private

328

land in Selbu municipality in South-Trøndelag county, the twist was again tied to areas within already

329

existing reindeer herding districts. The Supreme Court’s decision was split between a majority and

330

minority (9–6), but the minority was—with respect to the essential part— also in favour of the

331

reindeer husbandry (Anonymous 2002). Pertinently, the first-voting judge states that the right to

332

practice reindeer husbandry is an independent right which legal basis is provided through

333

immemorial usage (Anonymous 2002) and it pertains to a right; and not just tolerated use (Jonassen

334

and Kalstad 2003). The verdict represents an important victory for Saami reindeer herding in the

335

South (Holand 2003).

336

In sum, the history of reindeer herding in the South demonstrates that expanding and

337

favoured agricultural sector that has encroached upon traditional reindeer areas which again has

338

been translated to increased conflict between herders and farmers, i.e. increased inter-group

339

competition (Figure 3 and Appendix A for more details).

DISCUSSION

342

Nomadic pastoralism is inherently an expansive adaptation (Paine 1971). Its general characteristics

343

have been described by Hudson (1938): when a Kazak came of age, he was provided with his own

344

tent and a share of his father’s livestock. Father and son customarily placed their tents, and

345

continued to graze, together. During the course of generations

346
347

“…the economic pressure of inadequate grazing lands for an increasingly large group

348

sometimes induced an enterprising son of some important family to strike out for himself

349

with his herds, his dependents and other bold or dissatisfied individuals who wished to follow

350

him” (Hudson 1938:21)

351
352

With time, this seceding group came to consider itself as separate and independent. While the

353

relationship might have started out as close, eventually they became competitors (Hudson 1938).

354

This pattern points to an important aspect of nomadic pastoralism, namely that population growth

355

must be accounted for through expansion of grazing area. Hjorth (1981) argue that pastoralism is

356

viable if the population—both human and animal—stay static, or if population growth can be met

357

with territorial expansion. Conversely, if grazing areas become contracted—like with the border

358

closing in the North and the expansive agricultural sector in the South—conflicts arise because any

359

potential expansion occurs into the region of other groups.

360

Cultural group selection predicts that competition—between groups—sustain cooperative

361

norms within groups (Francois et al. 2018). It has even been suggested that collective action

362

problems at one level of organisation can be solved by leveraging the within-group coordinating

16

363

effects of between-group competition (Zefferman 2018, Waring et al. 2015). 8 Waring et al. (2015),

364

for example, found that learning between Fijian fishing villages, if strong enough, can overcome the

365

collective action problem within villages. Within a village, a Fijian might be more successful than his

366

fellow villagers if refusing to adopt sustainable fishing practices. However, villages with institutions

367

that encourage more sustainable practices tend to be more successful than villages with less. Villages

368

would thus likely emulate those with more sustainable institutions; in effect competition between

369

villages is a stronger selective force than competition between individual fishermen within villages

370

(Waring et al. 2015).

371
372

The North

373

In the North, the closing of the border Finland and Norway in 1852 and subsequent history resulted

374

in a decrease of pastures and, not surprisingly, increasing conflicts between herders.

375

Traditionally, winter pastures were informally regulated according to group membership—

376

i.e. Saami reindeer herders had a clear understanding of the fact that different winter pasture areas

377

belonged to different siidas—but when in need everybody had right to access alternative pastures

378

(Riseth 2000 132, Paine 1994, Marin and Bjørklund 2015). Furthermore, knowledge of siida borders

379

was socially transmitted: children most often continued in their parents’ siida. Long-enduring use of

380

specific pasture areas thus established reciprocally accepted rights in space and time. Paine

381

(1994:figure 5.7) demonstrates, for example, that while herds graze on physically separated areas

8

West et al. (2007) argues that while group selection is a valid approach it seems to confuse things rather than simplify.

Group selection takes at its starting point that groups varying in cooperative traits are selected for through e.g. conflict.
However, one could explain this with reference to an actor’s direct and indirect fitness befits: if cooperation in a group
entails increased survival and/or increased production, a cooperative act does not only carry a cost for the cooperating
individual but also a benefit, i.e. a direct benefit of increased survival and/or increased production (cf. West et al. 2007,
West et al. 2008)

17

382

during summer, during winter, pastures constitute an overlapping quilt. Neighbours were usually

383

well informed of traditions and rights connected to a specific area; knowing under which conditions

384

the use of neighbouring pastures was acceptable (Riseth and Vatn 2009). Traditionally, there was

385

also an obligation to share; practised as intra- and inter-community mutual aid and reciprocation

386

(Marin and Bjørklund 2015). Furthermore, since the siida changed size and composition through the

387

year (herders divide and regroup their herds on a seasonal basis) herders had potential access to

388

pasture and herding partners over a large area (Marin and Bjørklund 2015). Paine (1994) has, for

389

example, argued that the three reindeer pasture zones (or ranges, see Appendix A) in Kautokeino

390

constituted the primary territorial and social unit in which herders live and move. Moreover, they

391

were born into it and Paine (1994) conceptualises the ranges as inclusive social networks or as a

392

neighbourhood. By being born and living on a range, herders were granted rights of occupancy and

393

use (Paine 1994). For Marin and Bjørklund (2015), the traditional siida was also a land tenure

394

institution emphasising flexibility and negotiation. Herders were thus focused on cooperation

395

because “… it is practically important and because every individual’s reputation is a powerful asset

396

that allows them potential access to other siidas” (Marin and Bjørklund 2015:25). In effect, reindeer

397

herding in the North was characterised by a social norm or institution where reciprocal respect and

398

trust between herders was essential and where a breach of the social norm was traditionally met by

399

sanctions (Riseth and Vatn 2009 90, Paine 2009).

400

The closing of the border between Finland and Norway in 1852 started a process whereby

401

pastures became limited and where rights and use became more and more grounds for conflicts

402

between herders. In short, by losing access to winter pastures in Finland a new pattern of use had to

403

be established; a pattern that also regulated how different groups of herder could utilise pastures.

404

For example, herders from Kauotkeino—being most affected—increased pressure eastward which

405

again decreased the available grazing areas for the Karasjok herders (Holand 2003). In 1871, for

406

example, one exclusive winter pasture area for Karasjok and one for Kautokeino as well as a common
18

407

‘buffer’ area between them was established (Figure A1). This did not, however, alleviate the conflict;

408

the ‘buffer’ area became appropriated by the herders from Kautokeino as they had the right to

409

migrate into it earlier than the herders from Karasjok (Holand 2003).

410

In effect, access to winter pastures have been a source of conflict up until very recently; e.g.

411

conflicts between neighbouring siidas with respect to allocation of lichen pastures sharpened during

412

the 1980s and the traditional borders between siidas—as documented by Paine (1994)—were

413

challenged (Holand 2003, Marin 2006). Holand (2003) attributes the increasing conflict level to the

414

fact that expansive siidas opportunistically argued—and used—the increasingly officially view that

415

autumn and winter pastures were commons. As Marin (2006) argues, in the absence of a functional

416

alternative regime to the customary tenure system, a de facto situation of open access to resources

417

was created.

418

The situation with physically separated summer district in combination with more open

419

winter pastures provides a partial answer as to why herding in the North have the appearance of a

420

‘Tragedy of the Commons’, or why herders have chosen the pareto inefficient equilibrium of

421

maximising quantity. In effect, the collective aspect of reindeer herding has been undermined at the

422

expense of a free-for-all race in terms of increasing herd size, because herd size determines to a large

423

degree access to pastures (Riseth et al. 2004). The multi-level selection framework—where

424

competition between groups is a stronger selective force that competition between individuals—

425

does not work in the North. Hausner et al. (2012:2) report that 39 of the 44 summer districts in the

426

North are managed by one siida. The remaining five are shared by two or three siidas. If we view

427

overstocking as the collective action problem to be solved, the relevant level of organisation

428

whereby between-group competition should have within-group coordinating effects is thus summer

429

districts (or summer siidas). Following the logic of group selection, a herder be might be more

430

successful than his fellow herders if he refuses to adopt sustainable herding practices (for example,

431

adding additional animals on pastures while his fellow herders do not). However, districts with norms
19

432

encouraging herders to adopt sustainable practices will tend to be more successful than districts

433

where fewer adopt them (e.g. herds and herders in such districts buffers environmental risk better

434

by adopting a strategy focusing on livestock quality). Districts would thus most likely copy districts

435

with more sustainable institutions; in effect competition between summer districts should work as a

436

stronger selective force than competition between individual herders within districts. The problem is,

437

however, that the cooperative and competitive aspects of herding changes during winter: winter

438

siidas are smaller than summer districts and summer siidas; and might not even be composed of the

439

same people. In the North, the five largest winter pastures encompass 11–21 siidas, whereas the five

440

smallest winter pastures are managed by one to six siidas each (Hausner et al. 2012:2). Thus, any

441

within-district coordinating effects of between-district competition during summer breaks down

442

during winter. 9

443

While the situation in the North have the appearance of a classic ‘Tragedy of the Commons’,

444

it is more fruitfully viewed as an ‘Assurance game’ where herders have coordinated around the

445

pareto inefficient solution due to historical perturbations that have increased intra-group

446

competition and decreased trust. A pareto inefficient equilibrium is maintained because when first

447

established no-one can do better by unilaterally switching strategy (Fig. 2C).

448

Pertinently, official policies might help to exacerbate this trend (Næss and Bårdsen 2013,

449

Næss and Bårdsen 2015, Næss et al. 2011). A case in point is the decision to enforce proportional

450

slaughter. This works in the same way as having a large herd buffers environmental risk: slaughtering

451

35% have completely different outcomes for a herder with 1000 reindeer vs one with 100.

452

Consequently, it will pay off to have a larger herd. Furthermore, increased co-management—placed

9

This might change: the Norwegian government is in the process of initiating a redistribution of the winter pastures

individual siidas as this is assumed to ease both governmental and regional management. In principle, this redistribution is
reinstating power to the traditional Saami siida system by giving siidas exclusive user rights to geographical delineated
winter areas (cf. Næss 2017).

20

453

on the agenda with the Reindeer Husbandry Law in 2007—have limited application in an

454

environment characterised by low trust. Ulvevadet (2012 35) argue that the law relegated the

455

responsibility for achieving sustainability to individual districts and siidas. This even though it might

456

not be what the herders in the North want: Hausner et al. (2012:88), found, for example, that 88%

457

perceived the governance system as a necessary third party for formalized conflict resolution,

458

monitoring and enforcement. Pertinently, herders’ distrusts co-management boards because they

459

perceive them as not being able to provide impartial and fair treatment because of nepotism. For

460

some, the transfer of rulemaking authority to siidas was undesirable, as the elites have too much

461

power in the local boards, whereas others maintained that the reindeer are privately owned, and

462

they cannot tell their relatives to slaughter their herds (Hausner et al. 2012).

463
464

The South

465

Prior to the Reindeer Husbandry Law of 1933, it was the ‘Common Lapp Law’ from 1883 that was

466

applicable in the South. The ‘Common Lapp Law’ imposed strong obligations on the Saami vis-a-vis

467

farmers: §6 states among other things that grazing areas could be separated into districts’ and the

468

Saami were responsible for damages incurred by the reindeer on properties of the farming

469

population (Fjellheim 2007). Furthermore, the district designation also encompassed areas where

470

herders had no customary user rights—in effect the district areas were larger than what was

471

perceived as traditional pastures—because of a strong desire to include a larger area in the existing

472

joint district liability for damages incurred by reindeer (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013).

473

Because of the expanding agricultural sector, reindeer herding in the South has been under

474

intense competition with the farming population. Turchin and Gavrilets (2009) describes farmer-

475

herder relationship as metaethnic. When competitors belong to different metaethnic communities,

476

Turchin and Gavrilets (2009) argue that the intensity of conflicts are often amplified. Competition

477

(especially warfare) have been argued to be a major factor in e.g. political evolution (cf. Carneiro
21

478

1970, Carneiro 1981, Carneiro 1988, Turchin 2003, 2007, Turchin et al. 2013, Turchin and Gavrilets

479

2009). Conflict and competition are, however, not enough: its evolutionary impact hinges on the

480

relationship between population density and resources. A common response to conflict at low

481

population density is to move away from contested areas. In effect, low population density means

482

that unused and unclaimed resources are available at another location. At low population density,

483

mobility is thus a successful response to competition from neighbouring groups. As populations

484

grow, however, more and more of the available resources are used and unused resources become

485

difficult to locate. Consequently, increasing population density reduces mobility as an alternative to

486

open conflict (Irons 1979).

487

In the aftermath of the conflicts in 1794 and 1801, for example, one sijte—consisting of two

488

herding families—tried to relocate. While the underlying reason is unknown, Fjellheim (2007) argue

489

that it was most likely an attempt to avoid conflicts with farmers. This strategy did, however, not

490

work: one day 40-50 farmers—armed with guns, scythes and other weapons—came and slaughtered

491

392 reindeer 10; leaving herders dependent on public support and with a few reindeer. Furthermore,

492

the herders were chased away from the area (Løøv 1994). While the farmers were subsequently

493

prosecuted and convicted to pay herders compensation, the settlement had one important caveat:

494

that the Saami herders had to vacate the area (Fjellheim 1999). The money from the settlement was

495

lost or stolen and Løøv (1994) writes that members of this sijte ended their days as wandering

496

beggars and in several cases died under tragic circumstances.

497

From the end of the Second World War until the 1970s the prevailing view was that reindeer

498

herding was on the brink of collapse in the South (Gundersen and Rysstad 2013, Holand 2003).

499

Continued pressure from farmers necessitated a common front vis-à-vis external force (Holand

10

Interestingly, 304 reindeer belonged to the Sammi while 84 were in their custody and owned by peasants and officials

(Løøv 1994:167). In effect, herder-farmer relationships weren’t always conflictual.

22

500

2003). Furthermore, several trials during the 1970s, 1980s and 1997 resulted in a loss of grazing

501

areas (Holand 2003). According to Riseth and Vatn (2009), farmer pressure was a key factor for the

502

political organisation of the South Saami in the early 1900s. The first Saami national congress, held in

503

Trondheim in 1917, gathered many South Saami and just a few from the North. Furthermore, Saami

504

from the South were consulted by the Government; in short Saami in the South were more politically

505

active than the Saami in the North (Riseth and Vatn 2009). As previously stated, during the 1960s the

506

reindeer husbandry in the South improved, and the number of reindeer increased (Holand 2003).

507

Riseth and Vatn (2009) argues, that one reason for this was that the herders in the South lobbied

508

politicians to appoint professional agronomists in two vacant Saami Bailiff posts in 1969 and 1973 to

509

advance changes towards calf slaughter. Increasing calf slaughter can be conceptualised as a strategy

510

focusing on increasing livestock quality: Mace (1993) found, for example, that among the Gabbra,

511

wealthy herders control the breeding rates of livestock because it extends the longevity of females.

512

The underlying rationale is linked to the cost of reproduction (especially during occasions of harsh

513

weather conditions where the survival rate of neonates and even pregnant and/or lactating females

514

can be substantially lowered, cf. Bårdsen et al. 2010). A herder can reduce this cost by controlling

515

breeding rates (Mace 1993) or by slaughtering calves (Næss et al. 2012). Herders and the reindeer

516

husbandry management authorities succeeded in developing sufficient mutual trust as a basis for

517

cooperation, and when a calf slaughter subsidy was implemented in 1977 as part of the agreement

518

with Norwegian the state, many herders in the South were ready and quickly adapted their way of

519

harvesting (Riseth and Vatn 2009). In short, in the South, Riseth and Vatn (2009) argue that the Saami

520

not only participated but were in many cases a force themselves behind the institutional changes.

521

Consequently, the new polices were well fitted to changes the Saami themselves were supporting,

522

turning their focus towards increased production rather than herd accumulation (Riseth and Vatn

523

2009).

525

CONCLUDING REMARKS

526

The main point I wish to stress in this paper is that reindeer herding in Norway can be viewed as an

527

assurance game with two possible equilibria: increasing livestock (1) quantity or (2) quality. Instead

528

of viewing increased abundance as an example of a ‘Tragedy of the commons’ or as a natural

529

outcome of a non-equlibrium system, this perspective broadens our understanding of pastoral

530

strategies by viewing them as an outcome of historical perturbations affecting the evolution of

531

prevalent norms. Norms are thus ‘coordinating devices’ providing people with focal points around

532

which to coordinate behaviour (Schelling 1980). Competition between different groups has been

533

argued to shape normative content (Boyd et al. 2018) and the selection of herd accumulation in the

534

North and livestock body mass in the South could thus be viewed as a response to competition.

535

Pertinently, herders in the North have mainly competed against each other while herders in the

536

South have a history of competition against farmers. It could thus be argued that a history of inter-

537

group competition in the South has coordinated herders around the strategy of increasing livestock

538

quality. Increasing livestock body mass also decreases herd expansion and thus limits the potential

539

for encroaching on surrounding faming land, i.e. it also reduces the potential for inter-group

540

conflicts. In contrast, a history intra-group competition in the North has resulted in herd

541

accumulation as the preferred strategy. While this strategy translates into territorial expansion and

542

thus increases intra-group conflicts, herd size is to a large degree the measure of power: herd size

543

determines to a large degree access to pastures (Riseth et al. 2004). Both strategies are, however,

544

best viewed as a solution to the ultimate goal of long-term survival (Dyson-Hudson 1977), they are

545

just a response to different historical and social environments.

FIGURE TEXT
Figure 1. The North (Finnmark) and the South (South-Trøndelag/Hedmark) reindeer pasture areas.
From the top panel in each panel: temporal trends in reindeer abundance; growth rate; number of
reindeer per siida share; percent offtake, and average calf carcass body mass. Hatched grey lines
show mean values while grey show +/- 1 SD (Source: Reindeer Husbandry Administration 2012,
2016). Hatched red lines show the maximum allowed reindeer in each region as of 2003 (Reindeer
Husbandry Administration 2003 109), 2010 (Reindeer Husbandry Administration 2011 127) and 2016
(Norwegian Agriculture Agency 2017 80).

Figure 2. The general characteristic of a Prisoner’s Dilemma is that it consists of two or more players
who are each able to engage in either “cooperative” or “defecting” types of behaviour. Each player
benefits from the cooperative play of others, but individually each have an incentive to defect.
Because each player is better of defecting—regardless of the behaviour of the others—the game
yields a unique Nash equilibrium in which all defect and are worse off than if each player had played
cooperatively (Wydick 2008 27, because of the payoff structure: Temptation > Reward > Punishment
> Sucker). In other words, while the Pareto optimum is for both players to cooperate, this is not a
Nash equilibrium. In an assurance game, cooperating with a co-operator is preferred to defect
(Reward > Temptation); defecting with a defector is preferred to cooperate with a defector
(Punishment > Sucker); and mutual cooperation is preferred to mutual defection (Reward >
Punishment). In this case, mutual cooperation and mutual defection are both Nash equilibria.
Synergistic mutualism as described by the assurance game has two Nash equilibria (both cooperate
or both defect) but only one Pareto optimum (both cooperate, adopted from Alvard and Nolin 2002
534).

Figure 3. Historical perturbances and their effects on reindeer herding in the North and South. The
different perturbations are conceptualised as resulting in different outcomes in the North and South
with respect to the chosen risk management strategy. In short, maximising herd size (quantity) in the
North is primarily caused by increasing herder-herder competition (intra-group competition) in an
environment characterised by increasing pasture limitations. Maximizing livestock body mass
(quality) in the South is caused by increasing herder-farmer competition (inter-group competition) in
an environment characterised by increasing pasture limitations (see main text and Appendix A for
details pertaining to the perturbations).
