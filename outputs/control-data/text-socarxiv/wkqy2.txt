Abstract:
While many urban scholars acknowledge the importance of justice and participation for emerging
smart city initiatives, these dimensions remain inadequately addressed in critical literature. To
strengthen the smart city critique, in this conceptual
intervention we employ the theory of justice
developed by philosopher Nancy Fraser, organized
along the domains of redistribution, recognition, and
representation. Using Fraser’s tripartite framework
of justice, we reformulate and expand the existing
critiques of the smart city. Moreover, drawing on her
notion of transformative approaches, we argue for
shifting the discussion away from the smart city,
even an alternative one, towards the just city and a
just urbanism in the digital age.

1. Introduction
After being initially dominated by affirmative perspectives only, since about 2014 an increasing number of critical views on the smart city have been published by urban studies scholars (amongst others Hollands, 2015; Kitchin, 2016; Köhler, 2016; Söderström,
et al. 2014; Viitanen & Kingston, 2014; Wiig & Wyly,
2016; Bauriedl & Strüver, 2017; Hollands, 2008). Although most of these critiques directly or indirectly invoke justice, what they mean by it remains vague and
theoretically underdeveloped.
In order to strengthen the theoretical development
of justice in smart city critiques, we employ the
theory of justice developed by philosopher Nancy
Fraser. Even though it was not explicitly developed
for urban contexts (see for instance Harvey, 1973;
Fainstein, 2010; Soja, 2010; Lefebvre, 2003 [1970];
Brenner et al., 2009; Marcuse et al., 2009), Fraser’s
approach to justice is particularly convincing and, in

our view, very relevant for understanding social
justice in the smart city. It allows us to analytically
separate questions of economic, cultural, and
political justice, and at the same time to work out
their close (empirical) interconnections, as distributive injustices are inherently linked with cultural and
political injustices. Fraser goes beyond theories that
place either material redistribution or cultural
recognition in the foreground; because, as she
emphasizes, there is: “(N)o redistribution or recognition without representation” (Fraser, 2005, p. 85). A
critique based on Fraser’s theory of justice thus enables a comprehensive and nuanced engagement with
the uneven ways in which rights, responsibilities, duties, capacities, and opportunities are experienced
across existing urban contexts in which digitization,
digital networks, and internet-based infrastructures
are presented as an important goal of urban development and inherent public good.
The following section reformulates and expands the
existing critiques of the smart city using Fraser’s tripartite framework of justice, organized along the domains of redistribution, recognition and representation. In the final section, after briefly discussing (and
rejecting) calls and ideas for “alternative smart cities”, we call for continued conceptual analysis, policy
interventions and social struggles guided by Fraser’s
theoretical insights, namely an ideal of justice based
on parity of participation, to further urban social justice in a digital age. Overall, we understand our conceptual intervention as a base to shape the terrain on
which empirical investigations into justice in the
smart city may proceed.

2. Justice as parity of participation
According to Fraser (2013), social justice must be
based on the principle of parity of participation, i.e.
“social arrangements that permit all (adult) members

of society to interact with one another as peers” (p.
164). This requires, first, an “objective condition
[which] precludes forms and levels of economic dependence, and inequality that impede parity of participation…. [and second an] intersubjective condition [which] precludes institutionalized norms that
systemically depreciate some categories of people
and the qualities associated with them” (Fraser, 2013,
p. 164). The first condition refers to redistribution,
the second to recognition. In her later work, acknowledging the increasingly interconnected and
globalized world and recognizing that “it is no
longer axiomatic that the modern nation-state is appropriate for thinking about justice” (Fraser, 2013, p.
191), Fraser adds the political dimension of representation. It is important to note that social justice requires all of these conditions – i.e. redistribution,
recognition, and representation – and no dimension
can be reduced to the other. Fraser’s intention was
precisely to develop a conception of justice that encompasses all those dimensions and does not position them against each other, effectively overcoming what she calls the redistribution-recognition-dilemma (Fraser, 1995; 1997).

2.1 Redistribution
An analysis of the critical smart city literature with
the help of Fraser shows that most of the critiques
evoke an understanding of justice as redistribution.
Redistribution refers to the economic dimensions of
justice in terms of class inequalities and allocations of
wealth and opportunity. More specifically, attention
is drawn to the “social arrangements that institutionalize deprivation, exploitation, and gross disparities
of wealth, income, and leisure time, thereby denying
some people the means and opportunities to interact
with others as peers” (Fraser, 2013, p. 164).
Hollands (2015), for example, criticizes smart city
programmes as “technologically led, corporately influenced and tied to competitive models of the entrepreneurial city [...] undertaken by city governments
for urban marketing/ branding purposes” (p. 70).
Many critics see the smart city as a tool of transnational technology corporations, like IBM, Cisco, and
Google, to maximize their profits. The aim of these

1

companies is to create and expand markets and to
make cities dependent on their equipment and
knowledge for managing them, effectively establishing themselves as monopolists (Rauth, 2015; Söderström et al., 2014; Datta, 2015; Kitchin, 2014; Viitanen & Kingston, 2014). The smart city is seen as exemplifying a broader shift in the economy towards a
cognitive-cultural capitalism1 (Söderström et al.,
2014, p. 308; see also Wyly, 2013; Scott, 2011), which
can be understood as a search for a new ‘spatial fix’
(Harvey, 2001) in times of increasingly difficult accumulation strategies (Hollands, 2008). Critics remind
us further that such an accumulation strategy was enabled by the privatization of national telecommunication systems (Hollands, 2015).
Such commercially-driven urban governance has
several redistributional consequences: First of all,
smart city technologies are costly and most of the
costs are fully or partially borne by the public, effectively subsidizing the private sector. Even more problematic, by prioritizing IT investments, local governments redirect public spending away from less spectacular and already underfunded areas of public intervention (e.g. social housing, education, or health)
that would better address pressing urban issues like
poverty and inequality. It also comes at the expense
of neglecting basic – analogue – urban services like
waste management and sewage systems (Hollands,
2008; 2015; Söderström et al., 2014). Additionally,
some of the costs of the smart city are directly
charged to the individuals or households, e.g. the
costs for smart (electricity) meters. These are direct
financial burdens that especially affect poorer households because purchase costs will not be redeemed
by lower spending (Viitanen & Kingston, 2014, p. 810;
Rauth, 2015). A fourth redistribution issue is related
to questions such as who collects, owns and controls
the access to data and digital technologies, who profits, and who pays? Here again the assessment is pessimistic because “large private vendors […] control
huge swathes of the information economy and will
have disproportionate control over the future development of the economy and society thanks to the
winner-take-all dynamic enabled and amplified by
the internet” (Rabari & Storper, 2014, p. 38-39).

Its main characteristics being “(1) the new forces of production that reside in digital technologies of computing
and communication; (2) the new divisions of labor that are appearing in the detailed organization of production and
in related processes of social re-stratification; and, (3) the intensifying role of mental and affective human assets
(alternatively, cognition, and culture) in the commodity production system at large” (Scott, 2011, p. 846).

Rosol, Blue & Fast

Overall, “the real geography of an unevenly-developed world of richer and poorer cities, regions and
countries will not be effaced by the digital revolution”
(ibid., p. 40). Overlaying existing injustices with
smart city technology does not dissolve them but will
deepen and amplify them. As a result, new social and
economic divisions in smart cities have to be expected (Söderström et al., 2014; Hollands, 2008;
2015; Viitanen & Kingston, 2014; Köhler, 2016, p.
273). All this is contrary to a parity of participation as
a precondition of social justice.

2.2 Recognition
For Fraser, recognition, the second dimension of justice, is not equivalent with identity politics but refers
to social struggles aimed towards overcoming structures of subordination. Misrecognition occurs when
the cultural values that are placed upon certain
groups render them inferior and hence unable to participate as peers in social life (Fraser, 2013, p. 164).
Whereas redistribution examines the barriers to participation parity associated with wealth and class inequities, recognition directs attention towards the institutionalized patterns, structures, and policies that
produce and sustain inequities of social status.
On the whole, attention to status inequality along the
lines of race, gender, and other axes of social differentiation is notably absent from existing critical literature on smart cities. Given the significance of recognition to Fraser’s formulation of justice, these varied
and interconnected status inequalities warrant more
attention and analysis, particularly given the widespread claim by promoters of smart cities that the
benefits of technological innovation will accrue to all
(documented in McFarlane & Söderström, 2017).
Critical scholars who interrogate the forms of governance emerging in the context of the smart city
point out that the restructuring triggered by the implementation of smart city imperatives and technologies not only often exacerbate extant inequalities
but also requires ‘smart citizens’. This leaves “little
room for the technologically illiterate, the poor and,
in general, those who are marginalised from the
smart city discourse” (Vanolo, 2014, p. 893). However, not only the discursively devaluated and nontechnically affine citizens will find themselves at a
distinct disadvantage, but potentially everyone as
‘smart’ systems tend to be “more opaque” and difficult to navigate than existing urban systems (Rabari

3

& Storper, 2014, p. 39). These new forms of social exclusion work across scales, not only positioning individuals but also cities and regions differentially. By
suggesting the inevitability of a linear and universal
path of development, those who fail to adopt smart
technologies may be then framed as ‘lagging behind’
(Vanolo, 2014, p. 891-92).

2.3 Representation
In more recent work, Fraser expanded her two-part
theory of justice to include the political dimension of
representation. This third, both political as well as
spatial dimension, refers to the defining conditions
which determine “who is included and who [is] excluded from the circle of those entitled to a just distribution and reciprocal recognition” (Fraser, 2013, p.
195). Representation refers simultaneously to membership in terms of who counts, who belongs, who is
included, and who is excluded, and to the procedures
and processes that structure inclusion and contestation. Injustice occurs when there is misrepresentation, i.e. “when political boundaries and/or decision
rules function to wrongly deny some people the possibility of participating on a par with others in social
interaction – including, but not only, in political arenas” (Fraser, 2013, p. 196). Importantly, Fraser does
not assume static territorial boundaries of the nation
state as the most and only adequate stage for justice
claims.
The question of representation also plays a role in
smart city critique. However, it is mostly indirectly
negotiated via the perspective of participation; on
the question of the possibilities of contributing in
concrete situations to decision-making or data
collection. A discussion on how equal participation
can be ensured as well as a critique of misframing is,
to our knowledge, not yet present.
A core argument put forward by smart city advocates
is that digital technologies will provide participatory
and interactive platforms as well as real-time groundlevel data. Both will improve participation by promoting greater involvement in collective decisionmaking, augment the scrutiny of public agencies, and
thus empower citizens. Some go so far to argue that
digital technologies play a fundamental role in manifesting liberal democratic values, such as “individual
freedom, a more genuinely participatory political
system, a critical culture and social justice” (Rabari &
Storper, 2014; quoting Benkler, 2006, p. 31). Kitchin
(2015) observes that some “smart city vendors such

4

UCCities Working Paper # 1: Social justice and the smart city

as IBM and Cisco” have in response to criticism even
started to rework their discursive framing by altering
“the discursive emphasis of some of their initiatives
from being top-down managerially focused to stressing inclusivity and citizen empowerment” (p. 133).
For example, Vienna’s smart city Vision promises
broad social participation as an integral factor of their
strategy.2
As a key dimension of justice, representation provides a framework to examine claims that smart cities facilitate and enhance participation. The concept
of misrepresentation is relevant in our view for a critique of three underlying logics of the smart city: (1)
the positioning of citizens as consumers and sensors,
(2) the corporatization of urban governance, and (3)
the role of digital technology.
(1) Perhaps one of the most clearly identified ways in
which smart city narratives impede equal participation is through the positioning of citizens as consumers and as sensors rather than shapers or owners of
digital technologies, effectively masquerading buymore-strategies as responsive and citizen-centric
(Cardullo & Kitchin, 2017; Viitanen & Kingston, 2014).
The reduction of citizens to consumers promotes the
logic of markets, diverting attention from the procedures and practices that enable and constrain democratic participation. Problematically, the digital consumer frame also contains biases and exclusions that
leaves parts of the city and its population unaccounted for, particularly those that lack the resources, opportunity, or even desire to embrace digitally mediated forms of participation (Viitanen &
Kingston, 2014). Clearly, technologies enable individuals to gather data, but since they are not enabled to
meaningful act upon it, citizens are reduced to sensors (Goodchild, 2007), to “both a generator of data
and a responsive node in a system of feedback” (Gabrys, 2014, p. 38). The implication is that citizens are
challenged to provide (often app-based) solutions to
practical issues “but not to challenge or replace the
fundamental political rationalities shaping an issue or
plan” (Cardullo & Kitchin, 2017, p. 18). This also reduces participation to “computational responsiveness […] coextensive with actions of monitoring and
managing one’s relations to environments, rather
than advancing democratic engagement through dialogue and debate” (Gabrys ,2014, p. 38). Current

2

smart city experiments and control rooms are hardly
ever the result of participatory governance and democratic decision-making (Arbeitsgruppe Smart City,
2017, p. 27).
(2) A second instance of misrepresentation lies with
the increasing power of corporations to own and control technology and data (Bauriedl & Strüver, 2017;
Hollands, 2015). Not only are digitally-mediated interactions dominated by the economic, cultural, and
political values and interests of profit-maximizing private-sector actors (Hollands 2015), the ways the exigencies to which smart cities are supposed to respond – such as sustainability and climate change –
are also increasingly shaped by corporate interests
(Blue, 2016; Rosol et al. 2017). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the turn towards technologically-mediated forms of governance will continue to
favor the interests of transnational corporate actors
over other stakeholders (Viitanen & Kingston, 2014).
(3) A third area of misrepresentation results from the
ways in which digital technologies are restructuring
the material and discursive conditions of participation (Rose, 2017; Braun, 2014; Gabrys, 2014). The
problem is that technology is not just added as a bonus that people may or may not use or indulge in, but
that it changes society in fundamental ways. For instance, smart technologies facilitate the government’s capacity to monitor, anticipate, and suppress
public dissent and resistance, giving rise to the prospects of a “disciplined city” (Vanolo, 2014, p. 884).
As Vanolo (2014) observes: “The smart city discourse
has an effect on the way citizens are supposed to behave. On the one hand, citizens are very subtly asked
to participate in the construction of smart cities, on
the other, they are implicitly considered responsible
for this objective. This means that the citizen is resubjectified in the form of an active citizen required
to achieve his goals” (p. 893). Visions and designs of
smart technologies are thus also leading to new
forms of subjectification tied to the Foucauldian notion of responsibilization through participation (Rosol 2015).
Finally, employing digital technologies also requires
reframing the urban and urban processes in a language or code that technology can act upon. This is
based, as Söderström et al. (2014) observe, on a

Critiques, however, question whether the conditions to facilitate this, i.e. mechanisms and procedures to enhance
citizen participation, and empowerment are in place (Laimer, 2014; Rauth, 2015).

Rosol, Blue & Fast

problematic systems thinking, which reduces decision-making to “technocratic conception of urban
management where data and software seem to suffice” (p. 317). Such framing glosses over the political
aspects of urban policy development in which priority
setting and contests over meaning are central.

that’s our agenda, too” or “Of course, we are working
on it” (ibid., p. 21-22). Also, Söderström et al. (2014)
wonder about how to foster those alternative stories
that are place-based insofar as they respond to local
needs but still go beyond just “anecdotal small-scale
actions” (p. 318).

3. From the smart to the just city in
the digital age

Turning back to Fraser, we suggest that the thus far
proposed alternatives are in fact affirmative remedies
to the problems of the current smart city. By affirmative, she means “remedies aimed at correcting inequitable outcomes of social arrangements without disturbing the underlying framework that generates
them” (Fraser, 1995, p. 82). Affirmative remedies
have still valuable outcomes, and many would argue
that intelligent urban systems can be used for progressive purposes. Digitizing slums, for example, fill
in “blank spots on our city maps” where governments
lack critical information about urban life (McFarlane
& Söderström, 2017, p. 318). However, mapping
blank spots does not address the underlying structures that makes slums possible in the first place.
Vanolo (2016), also examining digitizing slums, goes
so far to say that “this may sound efficient, but it is
dangerous from a social point of view, because it
means stigmatizing and militarizing ‘dangerous’
places more and more” (p. 32).

More recent critical accounts do not stop at pointing
out the problems of the smart city, but also voice calls
for engaging with the smart city discourse by “crafting […] alternative smart city stories” (Söderström et
al., 2014, p. 307; see also McFarlane & Söderström,
2017). Alternative conceptions of the smart city put
forward by critical urban scholars are based on the
premise that they have to start with people and with
actual existing cities and their current problems, not
with technology (Hollands, 2015, p. 63). For example,
they advocate for a shift from technocratic to placeand knowledge-based smart cities that are informed
by the struggles in urban places that “disturb, resist
or create” their versions of smart urbanism (Söderström, 2016, p. 63). They draw our attention to ways
of a socially just use of technology, for example, by
(urban) social movements or by “digitizing slums”
(McFarlane & Söderström, 2017). They point out the
“myriads of initiatives where technology is used to
empower community networks, to monitor equal access to urban infrastructures, or [to] scale up new
forms of sustainable living” (Söderström et al., 2014,
p. 318) and in general promote a use of technology to
empower people through participatory and citizenbased smart initiatives (Hollands, 2015; 2008). Those
proposed alternative visions of smart urbanism are
valuable as they create counter-narratives and foster
a progressive urbanism that can challenge the dominant discourse of transnational corporations.
However, how do we create a strong alternative vision that is not limited to what Krivý (2018) calls an
auxiliary critique, which only adds “particulars to the
object of critique while leaving its foundational contradictions unexamined” (p. 14)? Krivý doubts that
the smart city can be challenged by a “bottom-up liberation of technologies in the name of people” or by
challenging “the SC’s corporatisation with liberal humanist values of inclusion, empowerment, sustainability and digital privacy” (ibid., p. 21). This means going beyond a critique of the smart city, which could
be retorted by smart city advocates with “Of course,

Therefore, and going beyond the affirmative, Fraser
(1995) proposes transformative approaches “aimed
at correcting inequitable outcomes precisely by restructuring the underlying generative framework” (p.
82). In our case that would mean shifting the discussion away from the smart city, even an alternative
one, and towards the just city and a just urbanism in
the digital age. A just city encompasses a distributive
dimension oriented towards overcoming class inequalities, a recognition dimension oriented towards
dismantling status hierarchies, and a representation
dimension oriented towards enabling transformative
opportunities for reframing the “stage on which
struggles over distribution and recognition are
played out” (Fraser, 2013, p. 195).
Surely we cannot define what that will exactly look
like. But we can use Fraser’s definition of justice as
parity of participation across economic, cultural, and
political domains to start posing questions and conditions to guide efforts towards it. Some of these
questions will be very specific to digitalized and networked city. For example, to what degree are citizens
provided the opportunity to opt out of digitization

6

UCCities Working Paper # 1: Social justice and the smart city

and still retain the capacity to fully participate in social life? Or we can ask, what forms of claim making
and struggles to address inequities of recognition are
facilitated or hindered by novel technologies and the
way they are owned and governed, and to what effect?
However, as transformative remedies of digital injustices aim at correcting underlying structural issues,
the main questions will remain broader as they are
geared towards fundamental justice questions. This
includes questions like: How are resources including
wealth, income, labor, leisure time and land distributed, who stands to profit from the introduction of
digital technologies and who will lose (redistribution)? Are there certain groups of people systematically depreciated and thus constrained in their ability
to make claims and receive recognition for these
claims (recognition)? Who is setting the frame for political struggles and justice claims and who is excluded from this frame-setting (representation)?
Adopting Fraser’s approach to the smart city literature means foremost attending to the interconnections among structural inequality, social status, and
political claim-making that shape and are shaped by
technology-centered, profit-driven urban initiatives.
In this, the smart city criticism can learn from other
justice movements. According to Schlosberg (2004),
for example, early approaches of the environmental
justice movement focused primarily on distribution
issues. Recent interventions, however, pursue a
broader approach, because “a thorough notion of
global environmental justice needs to be locally
grounded, theoretically broad, and plural — encompassing issues of recognition, distribution, and participation’’ (Schlosberg, 2004, p. 518). For the
movements for food sovereignty, Fladvad (2017)
shows that they turn against a misframing by
addressing the global level (political dimension),
calling for the recognition of a peasant way of life
(cultural dimension), as well as denouncing their
unjust class situation (economic dimension) (p. 60.).
Finally, Bulkeley et al. (2014) in reference to climate
justice call for a three-dimensional approach that
recognizes the way in which “each facet of justice is
bound to each of the others” (p. 34). Building on this,
with our contribution we would like to encourage
critical urban research to embed its smart city
critique in a broader understanding of justice based
on economic, cultural, and political parity of
participation.
