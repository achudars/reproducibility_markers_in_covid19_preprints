Abstract

When addressing public concerns such as the existence of politically like-minded
communication spaces in social media, analyses of complex political discourses are met with
increasing methodological challenges to process communication data properly. To address the
extent of political like-mindedness in online communication, we argue that it is necessary to
focus not only on ideological homogeneity in online environments, but also on the extent to
which specific political questions are discussed in a uniform manner. This study proposes an
innovative combination of computational methods, including natural language processing and
social network analysis, that serves as a model for future research examining the evolution of
opinion climates in online networks. Data were gathered on YouTube, enabling the
assessment of users’ expressed opinions on three political issues (i.e., adoption rights for
same-sex couples, headscarf rights, and climate change). Challenging widely held
assumptions on discursive homogeneity online, the results provide evidence for a moderate
level of connections between dissimilar YouTube comments but few connections between
agreeing comments. The findings are discussed in light of current computational
communication research and the vigorous debate on the prevalence of like-mindedness in
online networks.

Opinion-based Homogeneity on YouTube
Combining Sentiment and Social Network Analysis
Social media such as YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter have fundamentally changed
people’s political communication by offering the opportunity to exchange opinions across
time and geographical barriers. At the same time, there are risks associated with the use of
social media, such as being exposed to manipulative agents like social bots, the viral spread of
misinformation, or the formation of echo chambers, i.e., online spaces in which users
exclusively encounter information and opinions in line with their own.
According to current research, these risks could (a) undermine the heterogeneity of
opinion climates (Graham, 2015), (b) narrow (political) world views and even convey
distorted pictures of public opinion to individual users (Neubaum & Krämer, 2017), and (c)
foster a polarization of viewpoints and fragmentation of society (Sunstein, 2017). Empirical
studies using computational methods (i.e. network analyses) have found that users in
networks such as Twitter indeed move in ideologically homogeneous clusters, but are still
confronted time and again with information and opinions divergent from their own (e.g.,
Bakshy, Messing, & Adamic, 2015; Guo, Rohde, & Wu, 2018) which, in turn, has been shown
to contribute to depolarization (Beam, Hutchens, & Hmielowski, 2018).
While these examples provide initial evidence on ideological homogeneity in online
networks (e.g., are Democrats more likely to be connected to Democrats?), a focus on
ideology can only serve as a proxy for the extent to which individuals encounter views that
are dissimilar to theirs. When it comes to analyzing the connection between similar and
dissimilar stances, it seems more informative to focus on specific politically and civically
relevant topics that are factually debated, that is, on the content of the discussion.
Against this backdrop, the present study proposes an analytical approach that
addresses specific issue-related discussions on social media and opinion-based homogeneity
therein. Accordingly, we refer to opinion-based homogeneity as the extent to which a set of
political opinions that are similar are connected with each other (relative to the extent to

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

which they are connected to dissimilar opinions).While ideological homogeneity operates on
a general group level in terms of being, for example, liberal or conservative, opinion-based
homogeneity requires a reference to specific political topics. This topic-oriented approach is
thought to offer a more nuanced view of the nature of homogeneous versus heterogeneous
online discussions and the prevalence of like-minded spaces when it comes to political
discussions.
To our knowledge, no research has addressed online homophily based on opinionbased homogeneity by combining natural language processing and social network analyses.
Using the amalgamation of these two approaches, this study investigates to what extent
citizens’ opinion expressions in the form of user-generated comments are related to each other
when they represent a similar stance on a politically relevant question. To this end, written
German user-generated comments on political issues were analyzed.
Literature in this area has been limited to the investigation of social media platforms
such as Facebook and Twitter, largely neglecting the most popular video-sharing platform
YouTube. According to the website ranking platform SimilarWeb1, YouTube is visited more
often (28.9 billion visits in the last six months, as of November 2019) than Facebook (24.6
billion), and significantly more than Twitter (4.6) or Instagram (4.1). YouTube is turning more
and more into a platform where users not only watch videos, but especially young users form
communities to discuss videos or topics, and exchange opinions on current politically relevant
debates (YouGov & BRAVO, 2017). Thus, it seems a pressing need to investigate the
potential existence of political like-mindedness on the social platform YouTube. To formalize
the general objectives of this paper, two questions guide this research:
RQ1. How high is the prevalence of opinion-based homogeneity among YouTube comments
on specific political topics?

When addressing online homogeneity, there might still be differences between
homogeneity at a large scale, referring to the whole network (e.g., the whole platform) which
covers the full range of the topical discussions, and sub-networks in which discussions are
based on reciprocal responses. Consequently, we ask:
RQ2. How does opinion-based homogeneity vary between analyses on a macro level (i.e.,
focusing on discussions across the full network) and a micro level (i.e., focusing on
sub-networks) among YouTube comments?
To address these questions, this paper presents a combined approach of social network
analysis (SNA) and sentiment analysis (SA). Crawling a multi-content social networking
platform such as YouTube allows us to create a model based on unstructured German
YouTube comments to predict the sentiment score of multiple users toward specific
controversial topics. In particular, the present approach uses support vector machines (SVM)
to predict the sentiment score on German comments of controversial political discussions on
YouTube. These analyses were run for three different politically relevant topics: the right of
same-sex couples to adopt children, a ban on headscarves, and climate change. These topics
have been discussed extensively in the public and represent good examples of divisive issues
that are associated with fundamental moral questions.
Background
Political Homogeneity in Online Communication
In many instances, it has been suggested that politically and civically relevant
communication on social media can hold individual users captive in spaces in which they are
exposed to political views that are in line with their pre-existing opinions (i.e., so-called “echo
chambers”) (Boutyline & Willer, 2017; Sunstein, 2017). In light of democratic ideals,
politically homogeneous spaces are assumed to lead to political polarization and radicalization
since users are allegedly caught in self-reinforcing networks which, in the long run, could
become more extreme (Prior, 2007). When it comes to analyzing whether and how individuals
might get “caught” in those like-minded networks, different (non-mutually exclusive)

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

scenarios are conceivable (Flaxman, Goel, & Rao, 2016; Geschke, Lorenz, & Holtz, 2019):
(a) users actively homogenize their network and, therefore, their information sources, (b)
algorithms shape the ideological environment of users, or (c) users are incidentally exposed to
a thread of like-minded information (e.g., when comments refer to other comments that are
uniform in the stance they express). The present work focuses on the latter scenario and
investigates to what extent user-generated comments on political questions are related to
congenial comments by others.
Initial evidence focusing on political homogeneity online showed that people are
indeed connected to like-minded users to a larger extent than to politically opposing users in
the United States (e.g., Bond & Messing, 2015; Boutyline & Willer, 2017). Theoretically, this
pattern can be explained by the notion of selective exposure (Colleoni, Rozza, & Arvidsson,
2014; Knobloch-Westerwick, 2014; Zillmann & Bryant, 1985): People experience positive
emotions when consuming information that conforms to their pre-existing views and feel
stressed when the information contradicts their views. As a result, they seek out situations in
which they are exposed to information that is in line with their views. This makes them more
likely to affiliate with like-minded others and create homogeneous groups. While social media
users may commonly be fully in control of their virtual acquaintances (e.g., in terms of
friending or following someone or a news channel), they may not have full control over the
information and stances they are exposed to incidentally, for instance, when browsing through
certain Facebook or YouTube news channels (Lu & Lee, 2018). Following this logic, it seems
worthwhile to ask to what extent users are actually exposed to and in contact with opinions
they disagree with.
Empirical research addressing the potential existence of echo chambers in online
networks has been based on two different approaches: On the one hand, survey research has
relied on subjective estimates by social media users. This line of research, asking participants
how frequently they are exposed to opinion or ideological diversity, has shown that on social
media, people are incidentally exposed to heterogeneous opinions (e.g., Kim, 2018; Lee,

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

7

Choi, Kim, & Kim, 2014; Lu & Lee, 2018; Vaccari et al., 2016). On the other hand, another
series of studies used observational data and made use of computational methods, especially
focusing on SNAs.
The Assessment of Political Homogeneity Online based on Social Network Analyses
As a widely used method in research focusing on political homogeneity, SNA
examines the properties of social networks – networks composed of people and their social
connections with one another. In SNA, the property of an individual to seek social
connections to other individuals with similar characteristics is called homophily. In other
words, homophily is described as “the principle that a contact between similar people occurs
at a higher rate than among dissimilar people” (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001, p.
416).
Several studies have therefore used network analysis to examine political likemindedness in network data. Bakshy et al. (2015) analyzed Facebook data to examine the
political homogeneity of friend networks to identify whether users read and share messages
that are more consistent with their political ideological beliefs than cross-cutting content.
Their findings showed that about 20% of users’ Facebook friends were from the opposing
party, which increases the probability that users will receive content that diverges from their
own ideology. Another study focused on Twitter data to determine ideological homogeneity
by analyzing 3.8 million Twitter users and a dataset of almost 150 million tweets on political
and non-political topics (Barberá, Jost, Nagler, Tucker, & Bonneau, 2015). Their results
revealed that Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to be involved in the
cross-ideological dissemination of political and non-political information. Recently, Del Valle
and Bravo (2018) ran a SNA of the Twitter network among Catalan parliamentarians and how
information flows among them. Their study found that representatives are more likely to
interact with members of their own party who share the same political interests.
On a methodical level, to identify echo chambers which are characterized by
“disproportionate connections among ideologically similar political communicators” (Jasny,

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

8

Waggle, & Fisher, 2015), the structural properties of the social network – specifically, the
likelihood of connections between members of a group – need to be compared with the
political views of the members of the network. If the two are related, that is, if there is a group
of individuals with a disproportionately high density of intra-group connections compared to
the number of outside connections, whose members share political views that they do not
share with non-members, this group can be considered an echo chamber, that is, a politically
homogeneous communication space.
The identification of political homogeneity, thus, requires two steps: identifying a
group (i.e., a subset) of users who agree politically, and measuring whether there is a
disproportionately high number of connections between group members. Researchers have
used various methods for both steps.
A useful way of quantifying the relationship between intra-group and inter-group
connections is the E-I index. It was presented for the first time by Krackhardt and Stern
(1988) and compares the strength of internal connections between members of a class to the
strength of external connections to non-members. Other studies examining political echo
chambers used similar methods and based their conclusions on the E-I index, e.g., to assess
the fragmentation between pairs of discussion networks or the effect of tie strength on the
polarization in such networks (Bright, 2018; Chan & Fu, 2017). By using the E-I index, it is
possible to quantify the degree to which members of a group interact with each other, as
opposed to interacting with others outside the group.
In addition, the identification of political homogeneity requires information about the
political affiliations or views of the members of a social network. With observational network
data at hand, the arguably most accurate source for inferring an actor’s political views is the
set of posts and comments in which he/she expressed his/her viewpoints. Working with
unstructured text data poses especially difficult challenges (Stieglitz, Mirbabaie, Ross, &
Neuberger, 2018), but there are a few studies that have used methods from natural language
processing to tackle this problem.

Identifying Political Opinions based on Sentiment Analyses
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that
deals with the interaction between human language and computers to allow them to
understand incoming information and process it independently. One subdivision of NLP is
called Sentiment Analysis (SA), also known as opinion mining. Machine learning approaches
to SA classify texts by identifying their sentiment based on previously learned patterns.
Machine learning “addresses the question of how to build computers that improve
automatically through experience” (Jordan & Mitchell, 2015, p. 255). SA is a common tool to
summarize emotional communication patterns on social media and is becoming increasingly
important in the field of social media analytics (Stieglitz et al., 2018). Sentiment analyses are
ideally suited to address the distribution of positive and negative viewpoints on a question of
interest.
This method is of particular interest for the identification and further investigation of
political homogeneity online. With this approach, it is possible to recognize whether and
which people expressed a positive or negative stance on an issue and whether users are
referring to each other. There are only few studies on political homogeneity which use
machine learning approaches to infer the political views of users from the content of their
messages. Colleoni et al. (2014) classified Twitter users as either political or nonpolitical
(based on training data from blog posts) and as either Democrat or Republican (based on
training data from users’ tweets). Their results suggest that the degree of homophily varies by
political orientation: Democrats were less likely to have outbound ties to Republicans than
Republicans to Democrats. Studies employing similar methodical approaches found that users
are more likely interact with those who express similar views or stances than with those
voicing dissimilar views (Himelboim et al., 2016; Williams, McMurray, Kurz, & Lambert,
2015).
While previous research, therefore, offers initial evidence on how expressed
sentiments are spread all over a network, most previous studies investigated the Twitter

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

network in which users are explicitly connected to each other (by the feature of “following”)
and this original connection might be subjected to selective exposure tendencies (i.e., getting
virtually acquainted only to those who are politically similar). Still, it has been left open how
users respond to each other on particular issues on platforms that have less structured
networks (e.g., YouTube), increasing the chance of getting exposed to counter-attitudinal
content. For this purpose, it is necessary to a) focus explicitly on discussions about specific
political topics and b) analyze the network and its sub-networks that are formed based on
these topical interactions.
The Present Approach: A Combination of Sentiment and Social Network Analyses to
Assess Opinion-Based Homogeneity
So far, we are unaware of approaches in which homogeneity is applied to individual
topics and simultaneously combined with automated content analysis and SNAs. Previously,
the determination of homogeneity was based on the basis of ideological classifications (i.e.,
the network patterns among liberals versus conservatives). We are only aware of few studies
which examined polarization on the basis of topic-oriented approaches (e.g. Chan & Fu, 2017;
Häussler, 2018). However, as public opinion forms based on issue-related discussions, it is
key to focus on the analysis on specific topics. To this end, a combination of NLP – more
precisely, automated SA – and SNAs is necessary. The present approach is structured as
follows: First, based on manually labeled comments, the SA is performed with an SVM to
predict the opinion climate for the entire network. Second, the results of the SA are then
transformed into a network structure to compute the opinion-based homogeneity using the E-I
index.
Method
Dataset
All data in this study were collected using a custom developed Python application
which is directly connected to the YouTube API. Our application is able to collect multiple
datasets by requesting queries from the internal YouTube search list, the video list, the

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

11

comments list, and the replies list of each individual video. Each request to the respective list
has its own URL that allows the API to be accessed and data to be collected2. For each list, we
stored the requested data in a relational database.
The collected data contain the comments and replies of three controversial topics in
Germany: “Kopftuchverbot in Deutschland” (headscarf ban in Germany), “Adoption für
homosexuelle Paare” (adoption for same-sex couples) and “Klimawandel” (climate change)
which also served as search queries. All of these topics are associated with political questions
on which members of society have offered different answers. It has been suggested that
especially morally loaded and controversial topics imply the potential to elicit processes of
homogenization of opinion climates over time (Noelle-Neumann & Petersen, 2004).
Accordingly, we believe that opinion-based homogeneity is more likely to be prevalent when
focusing on such political topics (see Appendix3 A for more information about these topics).
When requesting the videos via search list, the parameter “relevantLanguage” was set
to the value “de” in order to get primarily German content. Furthermore, we sorted the search
queries for videos according to their relevance using the parameter “order,” whereas the
parameter value is set to “relevance.” While the two datasets “adoption rights” and “headscarf
ban” were acquired on May 15, 2018, the dataset on “climate change” was collected on
January 2, 2019. Each dataset contains the user-generated comments as well as associated
replies.
Table 1 provides an overview of the crawled videos with their corresponding search
term and the data provided by this crawling. To analyze a more accurate selection of videos
that reflect political issues, we filtered the videos by a specific categoryID4. In this case, a
categoryID of 25 indicates the category of “Politics and News” in the YouTube API.

Classification of opinions in social media
Manual Labeling. We created a human-annotated gold standard to create a sample of
the 4,000 German YouTube comments for each topic by defining a coding scheme. This
scheme ensures that the unlabeled data can be assigned to a unique class which represents the
sentiment of the message. We use the term “sentiment” referring to comments expressing a
positive or negative stance towards a specific topic (e.g., if a comment states “I hate
headscarves,” this comment is classified as having a “negative” opinion of headscarves). This
does not apply to comments whose general tone is positive or negative if they do not
explicitly express a stance on the respective controversy.
We selected two well-trained independent annotators who received the same dataset
with 4,000 randomly selected comments and replies for each topic. The data were labeled
considering three mutually exclusive classes: negative, positive, and others. The coding
scheme with corresponding topics and the listed classes is represented in Appendix A.
Agreement between the two annotators was measured using Krippendorff’s alpha
(Hayes & Krippendorff, 2007). The value of 0.63 was obtained for 3-class annotation of the
adoption rights data, whereas a value of 0.67 was obtained for the headscarf ban data. In the
case of the climate change dataset, a value of 0.54 was determined. All inter-annotator
agreement values are valid for further processing. To ensure better results for the machine
learning model, we decided to use only those comments for further analysis on which both
annotators agreed. This strategy guarantees that the sentiment can be clearly assigned to a

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

unique class without inconsistencies. Table 2 shows the distribution of sentiment classes for
each of the three datasets.

To derive the impact of the data showing a disagreement between the annotators
(borderline cases), we later projected these data onto our trained model to determine to what
degree our model takes this borderline case into account. The results of the contingency table
and the graph can be found in Appendix B.
Data Pre-Processing. We implemented multiple data pre-processing steps that
structure and clean the data to decrease the level of noise in the subsequent analyses. These
steps were the creation of a training (80%) and a testing set (20%), their cross-validation, and
the transformation of cleaned comments to Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) vectors (for more information about the data pre-processing see Appendix C).
Support Vector Machine (SVM). The application of SVM in text classification or SA
has been successfully carried out in many studies. A recent study used the in-memory
framework Apache Spark to apply a SA by using an SVM with a rbf kernel to classify
microblog comments (Yan, Yang, Ren, Tan, & Liu, 2017). Al-Smadi, Qawasmeh, Al-Ayyoub,
Jararweh, and Gupta (2018) compared the performance of recurrent neural networks (RNN)
and SVMs on a comprehensive aspect-based SA of Arabic hotel ratings. The results indicate
that the SVM performs superior to the deep RNN in terms of the research tasks (aspect
category identification, aspect opinion target expression, and aspect sentiment polarity
identification). However, the use of SVM combined with the network method to measure
homogeneity/heterogeneity in online networks is novel. The results of the above-mentioned

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

14

studies were very promising, and the performance of the classifiers was very high. Therefore,
we decided to adapt them as a basis for our research.
The training of the SVM is realized by a pipeline (fixed sequence of steps) which
starts by importing the cleaned training dataset and transform the text data into numerical
feature vectors to make them readable for the algorithm. We used a bag-of-words approach of
assigning each word to an integer and returning a vocabulary dictionary in the form of a
document-term matrix. The pipeline ends by fitting the TF-IDF vectors in the SVM.
Combining the processes of 5-fold cross-validation and grid search, we can initialize different
parameters during training and localize the best combination of parameters for each fold
separately. The best parameter set is used which reaches the highest subjective F1-score.
The F1-score is used to determine the performance of the model. Especially when the
class distribution is uneven, it is more precise than the simple accuracy measure. In a
systematic test, we used an SVM with a linear kernel based on the LIBSVM implementation
(Chang & Lin, 2011) of scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). The optimization of the
parameters was carried out through a grid search in 5-fold cross-validation. Instead of only
tuning the parameters of the classifier, we also tuned parameters that deal with the process of
data pre-processing. The list of all tuned hyperparameters is given in Appendix D.
The evaluation of the final model with their optimal parameters is based on the unseen
test dataset. We apply the weighted F1-score as the metric to measure the performance of the
model. Table 3 reveals the results of the prediction on the test dataset with their metrics.

The normalized confusion matrices for the three datasets (see Figure 1) shows that the
F1-score is strongly driven by the “others” category. Precision and recall for the positive and
negative categories are lower. In summary, the confusion matrices show that the biggest
performance losses are due to the classes positive and negative. In both classes, data is likely
to be classified in the opposite category which may be due to the low amount of training data.

Since the classifier achieves valid predictions on the test dataset and an adequate F1score of 0.85 for the adoption dataset, 0.88 for the headscarf ban dataset, and 0.83 for the
climate change dataset, it was to predict the sentiment of the comments across the whole
dataset.

Some users wrote several comments, each of which may express a combination of
stances. To simplify the visualization of the network structure and the calculation of
homogeneity, each user was assigned exactly one class as follows. Platt scaling was used to
generate probability estimates for each class and comment (Chang & Lin, 2011). In order to
summarize these values, we calculated, for each user, the average probability of each class
across their comments. The user was assigned to the class that was the most likely on average.
For an overview of the distribution of the prediction, please see Appendix D.
Building a Network on YouTube
In contrast to other social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, in which
friendship requests and follower relationships play an integral role, the structure of the social
network of YouTube users is not nearly as visible. Users can interact by commenting on
videos and by commenting on other users’ comments. In this study, we examined the
interactions between users’ comments, associated replies, and users who uploaded the video.
Thus, the focus lies on the exchange of messages between users. The SNA is structured in
three parts. The first part is the creation of the network using the YouTube data to visualize the
interactions across all videos (see Appendix F). Statistics are used to provide a general
overview of the network and to detect any conspicuous features. The second part deals with
the computation of opinion-based homogeneity with the Krackhardt E-I ratio of the global
network. The last part of the network analysis includes the segmentation of the networks into
smaller sub-networks using the fast-greedy algorithm and the calculation of opinion-based
homogeneity on a macro level (covering every comment on YouTube on that topic) as well as
exchanges on the micro level (in sub-networks).
As we aim to identify the extent to which users have varying opinions on a particular
topic, we decided to exclude the category “others” from the analysis as well as the removal of
self-links. Topic modeling was used to gain an overview of the data that was thus discarded
(Appendix E). The results show that the comments in this category were off-topic and
therefore do not directly contribute to the discussion between proponents and opponents on

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

17

the three controversies. The removal of these off-topic posts from the network led to the
creation of isolated nodes that no longer had any connections to other nodes and, therefore,
had a degree equal to zero. These nodes were also deleted from the network. To ensure that
the results with the class “others” are not entirely ignored, we also performed the entire
analysis on all three networks including this category. The findings can be found in Appendix
F.
To understand and explore the network more closely and to gain a deeper insight, we
have calculated various statistics and reported the results for the three datasets in Table 4.

The characteristics of all directed networks shown in Table 4 demonstrate that the
average degree is about one, suggesting that a typical user interacts with approximately one
other user. In general, accounts that have uploaded a video that many other users have
commented on have a higher in-degree (comments addressed to them). In addition to the indegree, the out-degree shows which users have interacted with other users the most frequently
by writing a comment. The low density values might be explained by the fact that the data
originates from a real network in which the users are not linked by friendships but by their
comments to each other, as well as by the high number of nodes. This pattern seems plausible
in a public network where the investigation and the focus is on comments. The combination
of in-degree, out-degree as well as number of nodes and edges explain the difference in the
diameter.

Measuring Opinion-Based Homogeneity. One of the main goals of this study is the
measurement of opinion-based homogeneity based on the sentiment of comments. To measure
the degree of homogeneity, the E-I index is an appropriate choice. The formula of the global
E-I Index is defined as follows:
𝐸𝐼 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 =

𝐸−𝐼
𝐸+𝐼

where E is the number of external links to a given subgroup (sentiment) and I is the
number of internal links to or between nodes within that subgroup (sentiment).
The index is in a range of -1.0 to +1.0. A value of -1.0 indicates that the network is
entirely homophilous with respect to the classes, i.e., all connections in the network are
between members of the same class (alternatively, each connected component in the graph
only involves members of the same class.). A value of +1.0 indicates an entirely heterophilous
network in which there are no connections between members of the same class (i.e., a
multipartite graph). In addition to measuring the global homogeneity of the network, it is
possible to compute a homogeneity value for each specific class (or sentiment) to identify
which sentiment has characteristics of a homogeneous interaction cluster. For example, the EI index of the negative class would be -1.0 if all connections, both incoming and outgoing,
that involve a member of the negative class were links to members of the same class. It would
be +1.0 if there were no direct connections between any two members of the negative class.
The index has previously been used in studies to investigate homogeneity in offline networks
(Eveland & Kleinman, 2013; Levendosky et al., 2004). To clarify the interpretation of the E-I
index, Appendix F shows three networks with different properties.
Identification of Communities and Extraction of Sub-Networks. The detection of
sub-networks to calculate the opinion-based homogeneity of each community could give
further clues about the opinion climate and possible differences between the macro and the
micro level. Especially in sociology, it is necessary for many activities to identify the internal
structures and groups of social networks. However, this can also be applied to online social

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

media such as YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter in order to recognize the community structure
of a network of users.
For this study, we used the fast-greedy algorithm introduced by Newman (2004) and
Clauset, Newman, and Moore (2004) which is a hierarchical approach for the optimization of
modularity in network analysis. This algorithm has already been applied to social network
data from Twitter in several studies (e.g., Mercea & Yilmaz, 2018) and has also achieved the
best results in the area of community detection based on modularity (Bello-Orgaz, HernandezCastro, & Camacho, 2017). The goal of this technique is to optimize the modularity to find
community structures in the network. The higher the modularity score, the better is the
sophisticated internal structure of the network represented. To determine the algorithm, we
compared fast-greedy on a test basis with two another algorithms called Walktrap (Pons &
Latapy, 2006) and Louvain (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008); the results
can be found in the Appendix G.
Results
Figures 2-4 show the graphical representations of all three topic networks. The nodes
in the network represent individual users of YouTube, i.e., users who have written comments,
users who have responded to comments, and channel owners, some of whom have also
written comments or replies. The color of the nodes represents their sentiment score: red for
negative, green for positive, and black for channel owners who have not written any
comments and are only in the dataset because they uploaded a relevant video.

Due to the aggregated probability values of the individual classes, it is easy to detect
which opinion the users represent. The connections of the individual nodes to each other
reflect their interaction in the form of comments. It should be noted here that this is a directed
network, so it is possible to see the direction of the information flow. The hubs in the network
represent channel owners who uploaded the videos that many users commented on.
Furthermore, it can be seen that apart from the hubs, the connections to the individual nodes
are distributed in a very mixed way and, thus, a heterogeneous opinion climate prevails.

Looking at the classes for each topic, it is evident that YouTube users more often
comment on messages that express an opinion that is different to their own than on messages
with a similar stance. This is corroborated by the E-I index which approaches +1.0 and the
relatively small number of internal ties (see Table 5). In addition to the visualization of the
entire network, the three largest sub-networks are presented graphically in Figure 5. The
visualization of the sub-networks gives a more detailed view of the network because it offers
evidence about the opinion-based homogeneity related to videos with a higher number of
comments.

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

25

By dividing the network into sub-networks, the individual communities can be
examined more precisely, i.e., structures of single or several channel owners are recognized
more effectively.
When comparing the three largest sub-networks of each dataset, it is noticeable that
sub-networks on the topics “headscarf ban” and “climate change” have a higher number of
users responding to comments. This is in line with the significantly higher number of
comments related to those topics. Furthermore, both topics are marked by denser network
structures in which different channel owners are linked by users.
The sub-communities are relatively large, and they do not reflect homogeneous
opinion climates with users unanimously speaking out in favor of or against a political
decision. Instead, they show a moderately diverse exchange of opinions. By examining the
sub-networks, a significantly more precise analysis and results can be created for the microlevel where not specific sections of the whole network are visible. It can be noted that every
sub-network exhibits heterogeneous behavior with regard to the opinion climate. Table 6
shows the results for sub-networks of global as well as class E-I Indexes.

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

Discussion
The present work was intended to (a) offer a new methodological approach to address
opinion-based homogeneity using a combination of NLP and SNA and (b) provide
preliminary evidence on the prevalence of opinion-based homogeneity regarding three
(politically) controversial topics discussed on the platform YouTube.
Addressing RQ1, results based on the combination of NLP and SNA did not offer
evidence for opinion-based homogeneity regarding positively and negatively valenced
YouTube comments on the topics of adoption rights for same-sex couples, the prohibition of
headscarves, or climate change. Instead, we found a moderate level of opinion-based
heterogeneity when it came to the connection, that is, cross-references among user-generated
comments on YouTube. In other words, comments on these three political issues were more
likely to be connected to dissimilar than to similar comments.
Regarding RQ2, it can be concluded that there are only minor differences between the
macro and the micro level in the determination of opinion-based homogeneity versus
heterogeneity. Both analyses – either focusing on the whole network or on sub-network –
show similar structures. In particular, a closer look at the different sub-networks can lead to a
more precise analysis because structures of individual communities can be focused, and
opinion-based homogeneity can be calculated specifically. Given analyses at both levels, one
cannot conclude that users on YouTube are exposed to a series of connected messages that all
represent like-mindedness in terms of a uniform opinion climate. This result challenges
previous research offering evidence for the, albeit weak, prevalence of ideological
homogeneity of social networks such as Twitter (Bakshy et al., 2015; Barberá et al., 2015;
Boutyline & Willer, 2017; Colleoni et al., 2014). These studies, however, focused on
ideological homogeneity, that is, to what extent Democrats and Republicans interact with each
other on platforms such as Twitter. Political discussions, though, may become diverse and
include diverging viewpoints even within these ideological clusters. Moreover, as indicated by
the same line of research, users still have ties to “the other side.” While previous studies

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

27

assumed that due to their cross-ideological connections, social media users might encounter
content that is created or published by an ideologically deviant source (Bakshy et al., 2015;
Barberá et al., 2015), it remained unclear whether users indeed encounter cross-cutting
content. The present work provides initial evidence that users’ opinion expressions are more
likely to be associated with divergent than with congenial comments by others. In fact, this
pattern is in line with the notion of “corrective action” (Rojas, 2010) stating that users feel
encouraged to become outspoken online when they feel that their opinion is underrepresented.
According to the patterns found on YouTube, this seems to apply as users tend to voice their
political stance especially in relation to previous comments that were different to their
opinion.
The only group with significantly more in-group interactions than out-group
interactions, as evidenced by a negative class E-I index, is the “others” group (see Appendix
F). This groups consists of users that discuss topics that are only vaguely related to the
controversy in question (see Appendix E). From the results of the study, it appears that such
comments commonly trigger a similarly off-topic response, leading to the creation of entire
comment threads that diverge from the topic of the video. These groups are therefore
homogeneous, but not with respect to their opinion on the topic of the video, which would be
a prerequisite for the existence of opinion-based homogeneity in the sense of the present
research questions.
The combination of machine learning and SNA allowed measuring opinion-based
homogeneity by assigning opinions to a particular class, training a model based on these
labelled data, and applying this model to all comments. Still, it should be noted that the values
predicted by means of machine learning do not reach perfect accuracy due partly to the size of
the dataset and the unequal number of samples for the different sentiment classes, especially
for the over-represented class “others.” However, the prediction of the test datasets gives us a
rough impression of the extent to which the classification works well on previously unseen
data and whether the model has generalized well or only classifies examples correctly that

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

28

closely resemble the training data. Looking at the performance metrics, it can be seen that the
model generalizes well with class weights that are suitable for rebalanced datasets.
In general, unbalanced datasets are a common problem in machine learning contexts
which can be solved by crawling and labeling even larger and more balanced datasets to
improve data quality and provide more training data for the model. In the pre-labeling
procedure, we have also helped to improve data quality by only using records for analysis
where both annotations matched. It is remarkable that most comments crawled on all three
topics did not elaborate on the question of interest. This is in line with early research
evaluating the deliberative ideals of online discussions which assessed that many
contributions made by users are off-topic (Janssen & Kies, 2005; Min, 2007; Schneider,
1996). Consequently, while the present findings may allow us to be optimistic about the
heterogeneity of political discussions on YouTube, it raises concerns about the relative weight
of these on-topic exchanges in face of a huge number of off-topic interactions.
Limitations
Our method of crawling YouTube comments about three different topics does not
represent the full landscape of the political discussion on this platform but rather gives an
overview of three currently discussed debates and exchanges to determine the degree of
homogeneity. One reason for this is the limitation of the YouTube API which only enables
crawling a fixed number of comments and videos.
Another limitation which can affect the opinion climate in the analysis, is the
imbalance of the labeled classes, making the training more challenging. Using 5-fold cross
validation and class weights which can be used for addressing the generalization problem as
well as for the hyperparameter search, we have tried to prevent the model from overfitting.
However, one reason why the accuracy of this model is so high is that this over-represented
class is more common in the training and test datasets, and it is therefore also predicted more
often automatically. This also means that the accuracy of the individual models strongly
depends on the available data. This, in turn, has a direct influence on the calculation of

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

29

opinion-based homogeneity in the network. Increasing the amount of data would therefore
also lead to the creation of a separate validation dataset which in the analysis could reduce
further knowledge about the prediction and the accuracy of the model as well as the reduction
of the overfitting.
As a further limitation of the work, it should be mentioned that excluding the cases of
disagreement between both annotators can influence the result of the classification and give a
misleading impression of the accuracy of the classifier. To prevent this, a higher number of
annotators would be necessary in order to have a uniform understanding of the comments and
therefore increase the precision of the trained model. The results of the contingency table in
Appendix B show that most of these borderline cases belonged to the class “others,” which is
also the most frequently represented one in the dataset.
For the present study, the YouTube network was built based on the connection of
videos, comments, and replies. Consequently, the network does not show the full connection
structure between the individual users (e.g., friendships on Facebook). Accordingly, we
consider homogeneity in the discursive sense between users although the criteria according to
which the user selects individual videos or channels cannot be determined on the basis of this
structure. In the present work, video uploaders assumed a key role as their opinion (provided
that they expressed one) was a central connection node in the networks. Their stance was
inferred from any comments they had made on their own and others’ videos. Future research
could also take the role of the video itself and its stance on the political question into account
and investigate its interplay with the opinion climate that emerges in the related comment
section.
While this applied approach has been limited to the YouTube platform, it is possible to
apply the same approach to other social networking platforms such as Facebook or Twitter
(using further political topics, in other language contexts) to measure opinion-based
homogeneity there as well. A systematic comparison of homogeneity across different social
media services will contribute to developing a robust understanding of the dynamics of

OPINION-BASED HOMOGENEITY ON YOUTUBE

30

political discussions online and the factors that determine whether they become homogeneous
or heterogeneous.
Conclusion & Further Work
This study has developed an approach to measure opinion-based homogeneity based
on textual messages with SA and SNA techniques on the YouTube platform by evaluating
three relevant and politically controversial topics. Specifically, we investigated, based on
communication data on YouTube, how expressed opinions in the form of user-generated
comments are connected to each other and to what extent opinion-based homogeneity and
heterogeneity mark the political discourse. In contrast to ideological homophily, which is
more suitable for the recognition of moral values and political identities, the present approach
allows the investigation of dynamic opinion climates which can change in the course of
political discourses.
The combination of the two methods SNA and SA has shown that a measurement of
opinion-based homogeneity based on YouTube comments is possible and can also be adapted
to different topical contexts and a variety of social platforms. In the overall network, instead
of finding evidence for opinion-based homogeneity, we found a moderate level of
connectivity among dissimilar opinions expressed in user-generated comments. Thus,
comments who expressed either a positive or a negative stance toward one of the three
political issues were more likely to be associated with a heterogeneous than with a
homogeneous environment. A similar pattern was found when the whole network was divided
into sub-networks, e.g., in which a lot of comments were related to each other. Accordingly,
this paper contributes to computational communication research in three respects:
1. It offers a blueprint for a combination of computational methods (SA and SNA)
that enable the analysis of large communication datasets in light of potential social
dynamics (such as communication content becoming homogeneous).

2. While previous network analyses focused predominantly on Twitter, this work
relies on political communication content available on the platform YouTube, a
platform that is growing as a political arena, especially for younger users.
3. Given the public debate about so-called echo chambers and political homogeneity
in social media, this paper offers evidence based on automated analyses of
observational data that extends previous research by not focusing on ideological
homogeneity but on opinion-based and issue-related homogeneity.
