Abstract
Can developmental aid bring peace to war-torn communities? The current literature is divided on this issue.
One line of reasoning suggests that aid is likely to decrease violence by improving employment and prosperity,
thereby making participation in conflict more costly. Another view cites evidence showing an association
between aid projects and increased insurgent activity. Addressing this contradiction, we argue that different
types of aid projects lead to different outcomes, as some projects foster an unequal distribution of benefits
within communities. Our reasoning draws on qualitative accounts from conflict zones, recent research on
how grievances associated with exclusion can foster civil war onset, and experimental findings regarding perceived inequity and punishment. Building on this scholarship, we use a recently developed event-matching
methodology to offer insight from contemporary Afghanistan. Aid projects that tend to exclude portions of
the community yield more insurgent activity in their wake than more inclusive projects. These results shed
light on why some aid projects reduce violence while others do not, emphasizing that efforts to “win hearts
and minds” can be a source of both contentment and contestation.

Introduction
Can developmental aid bring peace to war-torn communities? Despite myriad peace-promoting government
programs and third-party interventions in conflict and post-conflict settings, there is a limited understanding
of how these efforts function (for reviews, see Blattman and Ralston 2015; Blattman and Annan 2016; Brük,
Ferguson, Stojetz, and Izzi 2016). With this article, we provide new insight into the relationship between
developmental aid and conflict. To do so, we build on current disaggregated designs used to study local
conflict dynamics (Cederman and Vogt 2017) and examine the effects of wartime aid projects on insurgent
activity in the case of contemporary Afghanistan.
By analyzing data on the United States military’s distribution of aid and its clashes with insurgents
between 2004 and 2009 with a recently developed event-matching methodology, matched wake analysis
(MWA) (Schutte and Donnay 2014), we uncover evidence linking aid-driven local exclusion and conflict.
Specifically, we find that insurgent action increases soon after, and in the spatial vicinity of, the start of
local-level aid projects that only benefit a small circle of residents, relative to projects helping the entire
locality. When these results are interpreted in light of first- hand accounts from insecure areas of Afghanistan,
they indicate that exclusionary local aid projects engender grievances associated with inequity and injustice,
which then intensifies localized insurgent activity.
The findings align with a growing body of scholarship showing that third-party aid programs reinforce
indigenous perceptions of ‘winners and losers’, causing feelings of frustration among the losers (Tokdemir
2017). Importantly, however, our micro-spatiotemporal design enables us to extend this insight to conflict
dynamics at the local level. In addition, our results inform a debate over the efficacy of a large-scale aid
program implemented by the US military, thereby sharpening our understanding of how local developmental
aid can be used to stabilize regions wracked by war.

Wartime aid and armed conflict
As in other areas of social science, the study of war and peace has been guided by theories of human
behavior. The predominant view in political economy and international relations research contends, first,

3

that individuals facing the choice of engaging in armed conflict carefully relate the associated costs to
the anticipated benefits and, second, the payoffs of successful revolutions tend to apply to entire societies.
Consequently, rebels face a collective action problem: fewer and fewer individuals would be willing to risk
their lives for a political outcome that they could also live to see if they remained passive. Rebels should
be inclined to “free ride” on the efforts and sacrifices of their comrades. Thus, in this view, participation
in conflict is non-economical and observed participation is likely best explained as an attempt to secure
material benefits from the uprising (Olson 1965; Lichbach 1995).
This so-called “rationalist” reasoning was bolstered as the widespread adoption of econometric methodology paved the road for global comparisons. A robust negative correlation between levels of economic
development and conflict suggested that rebellion emerges only when rebels had nothing to lose (Collier and
Hoeffler 2004). In addition, other factors contributing to civil war onset were found to correlate with lowered
opportunity costs. Rebels operating against weak states and in inaccessible terrain, for example, appeared to
face diminished risks compared to those attacking strong states (Fearon and Laitin 2003). Similarly, armed
conflict was found to be more likely when foreign aid shocks rendered rebels’ payoffs from conflict greater
than what a government could credibly promise (Nielsen, Findley, Davis, Candland, and Nielson 2011).
As a whole, this scholarship suggests that aid delivery should help decrease political violence—a belief
long shared by policy makers and practitioners (Lake 2010). One highly visible implementation of this
conclusion was the US-led campaign to “win hearts and minds” during the recent wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq. Over the course of these conflicts, the US military introduced protocols to “weaponize” aid (CALL
2009) and lawmakers increased funding for local-level aid programs in conflict zones (Hedgpeth and Cohen
2008; SIGAR 2015a). Early research on these programs offered further support: aid in Iraq decreased
insurgent activity (Berman, Shapiro, and Felter 2011; Berman, Felter, Shapiro, and Troland 2013) and, in
Afghanistan, increased the legitimacy of the state (Böhnke and Zürcher 2013).
A growing body of empirical work, however, has begun to challenge the widespread assumption that
aid generally mitigates violence. Nunn and Qian (2014), for example, show that food aid to conflict zones
increases the duration of conflict. Crost, Felter, and Johnston (2014) find that World Bank projects may
stoke insurgent violence in the Philippines. Recent evidence from Afghanistan suggests that local-level aid

4

projects instigated by US military units result in more attacks by armed opposition groups under certain
conditions (Child 2014; Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov 2016; Sexton 2016). A key insight from this
recent scholarship is that insurgents strategically respond to types of aid, sometimes leading to an uptick
in violence. Namely, insurgents resist the implementation of aid projects if the projects are of a type that
jeopardizes their capacity to fight.
Empirical findings such as these draw our attention to how various types—rather than quantities—of
aid function in precarious settings (e.g., Böhnke and Zürcher 2013; Blattman and Ralston 2015). In this
vein, we propose a way of understanding how aid affects conflict based on the influence projects can have
on the intended receipts—the local populace. To do so, we build on the large body of research emphasizing
that insurgencies are population-centric wars and, as a result, calls for disaggregated approaches to studying
conflict (see Cederman and Vogt 2017). In other words, we begin with the premise that incumbents and
insurgents compete over the loyalties of citizens at the local level (e.g., Kalyvas 2006; Lyall 2009; Kocher,
Pepinsky, and Kalyvas 2011; Schutte 2017). Adopting this perspective when systematically studying the
effects of aid on intra-community conflict dynamics, we believe, complements the extensive existing research
focused on the rational and strategic calculus of armed actors. In the next section, we develop our framework
by theorizing the differential effects of aid projects types on relations within communities and popular support
for anti-state actions.

Aid, exclusion, and violence
Despite the prominence of rationalist explanations for conflict dynamics, some scholars of political violence
and social movements have long pointed to feelings of frustration and injustice as an alternative (for a
review, see Gurr [1970] 2011). These so-called grievance-based explanations have seen a recent renaissance
in comparative research. By disaggregating entire conflicts into actors such as rebel organizations and
ethnic groups, the role of horizontal inequalities and political exclusion in fostering conflict has become more
apparent (Buhaug, Cederman, and Rød 2008; Wimmer, Cederman, and Min 2009; Cederman, Gleditsch,
and Buhaug 2013; Wimmer 2013). The rationalist explanations for armed conflict still hold by and large,
but it has become clearer how specific circumstances systematically provoke grievances and increase the risk
5

of conflict (Hechter, Pfaff, and Underwood 2016).
We argue that such grievance can be induced by certain types of war-time aid. Certainly, some aid projects
during wartime increase individuals’ satisfaction with the incumbent and thereby foster peace. This is the
operating assumption of incumbent military forces, international aid donors, and the rationalist-orientated
scholars who argue that aid should decrease violence either by increasing the opportunity costs of joining the
insurgency or compelling civilians to share actionable information on insurgents with the incumbent forces
(Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Lebovic 2010; Berman and Matanock 2015).
This assumption rests on the premise that aid projects benefit all members of a community somewhat
equally. First-hand accounts from settings such as Afghanistan, however, provide ample evidence that local
aid projects frequently favor one portion of the populace over others. Horne (2012), for example, details how
well-connected civilian sub-contractors can capture a large share of war-time aid to the determent of the larger
community. Chandrasekaran (2012: 169) reports that residents killed a district governor in Afghanistan’s
Helmand province because he was enriching himself from reconstruction projects rather than distributing
resources more widely. Martin (2014: 112) recalls how Afghan villagers believed “elders [responsible for
overseeing aid projects] stole from their own communities”, leading to his conclusion that “these [aid project]
dynamics fed jealousy in . . . society.”1 While such evidence of inequity in aid benefits often centers on local
government, tribal, or business elites (see Gordan 2011; Gopal 2014; Karell 2015), the more general social
process is rooted in feelings of “rivalry”, “jealousy”, “injustice”, and “exclusion” (Fishstein and Wilder 2012;
Kilcullen 2013). In other words, residents in fragile, unstable settings often interpret externally-provided aid
projects through the lens of a localized “zero-sum” game. With each project, there are winners and losers,
whether they are landed elites or marginalized citizens (Fishstein and Wilder 2012; Malkasian 2013).
As with grievances fueled by horizontal inequalities between large sub-national groups (Cederman, Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013), aid-induced exclusion can ultimately generate localized tensions and, sometimes,
violence (e.g., Malkasian 2013; Martin 2014).2 This within-community dynamic occurs because the process
unfolds among individual residents of a locality—a micro-pathway that is, in the end, not surprising. Beyond
1 The

creation of grievances by aid in fragile contexts is of course not limited to contemporary conflicts. Malkasian (2013)
chronicles how a Cold War-era irrigation project created friction between internal migrants and landed tribes in southern
Afghanistan.
2 As Fishstein and Wilder (2012: 58) put it, “If . . . some elements of society are perceived to have grown wealthy at the expense
of others, this may feed a sense of injustice. . . that could motivate armed opposition . . . In this scenario, anger is bred not so
much by absolute poverty but by a strong sense of exclusion and injustice.”

6

the anecdotal evidence from conflict settings, perceiving an inequitable distribution of payoffs has been systematically observed to be a potent motivator for levying punishment. This insight robustly emerges from
lab and field applications of the “ultimatum game” (Camerer and Thaler 1995; Güth, Schmittberger, and
Schwarze 1982). Tasked with dividing an allocated amount of resources between two players, the rational
equilibrium strategy in this game is for the first player to reserve a maximum payoff for herself and offer a
minimum to the other player. Correspondingly, the rational strategy for the second player is to accept any
offer deviating from zero—a rejection by the second player, due to the rules of the game, would leave both
players with nothing.
Yet, human behavior in this specific case drastically deviates from rationality. Second players receiving
an offer they perceive as inequitable frequently reject it to punish the allocator even at the expense of
their own payoff. In other words, punishment for an inequitable exclusion from resources has been found to
routinely outweigh the costs.3 This discrepancy of rationalist expectation and behavioral reality has profound
implications for developmental aid as a pacification strategy. If the benefits of incumbents’ counterinsurgency
aid projects favor only parts of the community, the perceived inequity of aid distribution may have an
inadvertent adverse effect on civilian acceptance of government rule. Namely, excluded civilians could reject
incumbents’ rule and begin supporting armed opposition as a way to “punish” the incumbents.4
In sum, evidence from first-hand accounts, professionals in the field, and experimental social science suggests that in the midst of irregular wars, local-level exclusion from incumbent resource allocation can intensify
subsequent insurgent activity. This relationship unfolds through an intra-community, micro-pathway linking
aid, exclusion, grievances, and violence. Moreover, the evidence—and the micro-level dynamics—indicate
that the process commences with the initiation of aid projects. The start of a project provides a strong
signal to residents regarding “what is in [the project] for them” (Chandrasekaran 2012: 72). This is because
residents’ perceptions of a project’s scope and applicability—perceptions that are quickly formed—influence
3 For

a review of the robustness of this pattern of behavior, see Henrich 2000 and Andersen, Ertac, Gneezy, Hoffman, and List
2011.
4 This argument rests on the assumption that the psychological reaction to inequity in the ultimatum game scales to violent conflict. We base this assumption partly on the aforementioned widely reported robustness of rejection behavior in circumstances
when stakes are high (for discussion, see Henrich 2000; Andersen, Ertac, Gneezy, Hoffman, and List 2011). In addition,
the assumption aligns with some of the foundational research on conflict motivation: in Gurr’s ([1970] 2011) classic work, the
widely studied “frustration-aggression link” (Dollard, Doob, Mowrer, and Sears 1939) provides a guideline for the empirical
expectations that aggrieved segments of the populace engage in armed mobilization. For historical evidence in support of this
assumption, see Gould 1996.

their response to external aid (Böhnke and Zürcher 2013). Thus, based on these insights, we expect that
the initiation of incumbent aid projects that exclude parts of the community will result in increased insurgent
activity.5 The following section assesses this expectation through an analysis of the locations and timing of
aid projects and insurgent activity.

Empirical analysis
Case selection: Afghanistan
As the recent US-led war in Afghanistan progressed, insurgent activity became more frequent and deadly.
The US and its allies responded with a strategic reconceptualization. Rather than encouraging peace by
building democratic government institutions in Kabul, military forces were increasingly tasked with providing
security and essential services to the populace via local-level aid projects (Lake 2010). This aid was intended
to gain the support of the populace and pacify the country—“win hearts and minds”. Consequently, resources
allocated to localized aid programs ballooned. For example, funding for the US military’s “Commander’s
Emergency Response Program” (CERP) in Afghanistan increased from 40 million USD in 2004 to one billion
USD in 2010 (SIGAR 2015b).
Unfortunately, as discussed in the previous section, these “hearts and minds” efforts did not benefit all
members of local communities equally . In some instances, the inequity was unintended; resources were coopted by local elites involved in project implementation (Fishstein and Wilder 2012; Horne 2012). In other
instances, however, inequitable benefits were part of projects’ design. CERP projects, for example, ranged
from supporting targeted marginalized segments of local communities (e.g., “social protection” projects) to
bolstering “infrastructure and natural resources” accessible to all community residents, such as a new road
or snow-clearing operations.
The contemporary Afghan conflict, then, offers an ideal opportunity for examining how external, localized wartime aid can have differential effects on insurgency activity, depending on how types of aid projects
influence inequity and insurgent support among residents of communities. First, during this increasingly
5 Our

focus on the initiation of projects is further motivated by recent evidence showing that the adverse effects of local
aid programs on non-recipients are strongest at the start of the program, and that these negative effects dissipate quickly
(Haushofer, Reisinger, and Shapiro 2015).

ferocious war, Afghans experienced an influx of aid projects into their communities that varied in excludability. Second, contemporary Afghanistan is what Gerring (2007) calls a crucial case: the amount of human
and material capital devoted to counterinsurgency-linked aid makes it a strong test of our argument. That
is, in Afghanistan, observing a pacifying effect of aid is more likely. Therefore, if we see evidence of specific
types aid generating sympathy for insurgents and insurgent activity, we gain greater confidence in their
detrimental effect.

Aid provision and conflict dynamics
In order to study the effects of aid-related local exclusion on subsequent conflict dynamics, we compare two
types of aid projects with differing levels of accessibility: “social protection” CERP projects versus “infrastructure and natural resources” CERP projects. Our comparison uses a recently developed methodology
for the causal analysis of event data (Schutte and Donnay 2014). This allows us to test whether local aid
projects’ relative exclusivity leads to more insurgent activity in their vicinity after project initiation under
otherwise most comparable conditions.

Event data
Our analysis primarily employs two datasets. The first covers 45,717 incidences of insurgent activity in
Afghanistan from 2004 through 2009 gathered from the Significant Activity (SIGACT) database constructed
by the US military. Using the SIGACT database rather than event data coded from media sources (see
Raleigh, Linke, Hegre, and Karlsen 2010; Sundberg, Lindgren, and Padskocimaite 2010) has three advantages. First, SIGACTs are passed up the chain of command from the platoon level, resulting in an extremely
detailed record of the conflict. Second, SIGACT is free of the reporting biases and inaccuracies found in
some media-based reporting (Weidmann 2015; 2016). Third, SIGACT codes which side initiated an attack,
enabling us to focus on insurgent activity. These advantages have contributed to a recent widespread use of
SIGACT data (e.g., Braithwaite and Johnson 2012; Condra and Shapiro 2012; Weidmann 2015; Schutte
2017).
Yet, despite the advantages, there remain two possible limitations. First, SIGACT data only capture

9

events witnessed by US forces. Our focus, however, is on the influence of the US military’s CERP projects,
ensuring uniformly high probability of insurgent attacks being recorded in the data. Second, the data likely
suffer from measurement error in that different units of US forces recorded events differently. But, as Berman,
Shapiro, and Felter (2011) point out, there is no evidence that the error non-randomly varies with other
variables of interest. Thus, due to its high precision and wealth of information, SIGACT is the ideal dataset
for studying the dynamics of the Afghan insurgency.
The second dataset comprises records from the NATO’s Afghanistan Country Stability Picture (ACSP),
a database on reconstruction and development projects across Afghanistan from 2003 to 2009.6 The dataset
codes projects funded by CERP, an aid program corresponding to our interest in local level conflict dynamics.
CERP were implemented in collaboration with members of the local populace and were designed to have
a relatively swift localized impact on civilians’ attitudes and behaviors. Indeed, these attributes, which
embody the ethos of contemporary counterinsurgency strategy, have resulted in several recent studies on
the association between CERP and conflict (e.g., Berman, Felter, Shapiro, and Troland 2013; Child 2014;
Sexton 2016). Unlike this previous work, however, we make use of the dataset’s precise information on
projects’ start dates and geographic coordinates in a quasi-experimental design, as discussed below. We also
make use of information on how each project has been categorized according to the Afghanistan National
Development Strategy (GIROA 2008), or ANDS, as well as a natural language description of what the
project entailed.

Types of aid
We expect that the initiation of relatively more exclusionary aid will generate more insurgent activity.
To examine this effect, we compare two types of CERP projects, “social protection” and “infrastructure
and natural resources”. The projects classified under the former ANDS label provided targeted assistance to
marginalized segments of communities by delivering cash or material to individuals deemed vulnerable, either
directly or through local contractors and non-governmental organizations (GIROA 2008). Consequently,
social protection projects benefited only portions of communities, either by singling out residents for special
help or funding private local groups. In contrast, infrastructure projects had a more inclusive aim. They

comprised activities such as the building and maintenance of roads and the development of electrical and
telecommunications grids (GIROA 2008). Between 2003 and 2009, the range of our data, there were 1,142
social protection projects and 1,482 infrastructure projects.
We maintain that social protection projects were more exclusive than infrastructure efforts.7 This view is
based on published interviews with Afghans and research showing that rural residents consistently understood
aid as exclusionary when some individuals benefited from directly receiving or capturing resources, not when
development improved living conditions for some but not others (Fishstein and Wilder 2012; Karell 2017).
In addition, residents regularly stated a desire for infrastructure projects, which they described as providing
broad benefits (Gordan 2011; Fishstein and Wilder 2012). Finally, when infrastructure projects were
reported to be exclusionary, it was often between—not within—broader settlement areas, such as when a
bridge connected one community but not another to a district center (Gordan 2011; Fishstein 2012). Such
a potential source of tension operates at a different scale than our following micro-spatiotemporal analysis;
our design uncovers distinct conflict dynamics at a within-community scale (e.g., two kilometers).
A possible objection to using ANDS labels for project classification is that the labels might not reflect
the actual activity. So, to gain more insight into what types of projects entailed, we analyze individual
projects’ natural language descriptions using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models (Blei, Ng, and
Jordan 2003). These models probabilistically identify “topics”, inferred from words’ co-occurrence, across
the individual project descriptions included under the labels of “social protection” and “infrastructure and
natural resources”. In simpler terms, the topic models help us evaluate whether the descriptions reflect their
project’s categorized type, without pre-analysis biases (Mohr and Bogdanov 2013).
We gather the descriptions under each of the two project types into separate corpora, then model five
topics for each collection.8 Table 1 presents the six words most associated with each topic, as well as the
distribution of these topics in each corpus. We see that the topics evoke their respective ANDS label. The
most prevalent social protection topic (Topic 4) concerns replenishing and providing humanitarian material.
Other topics allude to the provision of goods to needy recipients, such as cooking facilities and equipment
7 We

cannot rule out that some infrastructure projects offered exclusive benefits: a new irrigation canal could have helped a
portion of a community’s farmers but not others. However, we posit that, overall, infrastructure aid acted as less exclusionary
within communities than social protection aid.

(Topic 1) and tents and blankets (Topic 2). The topics generated by the infrastructure project descriptions
are suggestive of, unsurprisingly, infrastructure. The two most common topics relate to repairing bridges
and pavement (Topic 1) and providing or constructing roads, wells, water, and power (Topic 2).
The topic modeling supports, first, the validity of using ANDS labels to differentiate project types and,
second, our interpretation of the projects’ relative exclusivity. The social protection project descriptions
indicate that these projects benefited specific segments of the population, such as those in need of immediate
humanitarian assistance. In contrast, the topics found in the infrastructure and natural resources project
descriptions show that these projects supported widely-accessible development. However, to be clear, we
do not conceptualize social protection projects or infrastructure works as being universally exclusive or
inclusive, respectively. Infrastructure projects could have benefited limited portions of a community, such
as contractors awarded a construction bid or residents living nearest to a new bridge crossing. Instead, we
understand these project types as proxying the ends of an ordinal range of aid exclusivity.

resolution of one kilometer close to the equator to assign the elevation of each geographic point, population
size, and whether an event occurred in an urban or non-urban environment.9
In Afghanistan, conflict events also correlate with the presence of roads since most violent incidences
were improvised explosive devices (IEDs) planted alongside roads to target incumbent vehicles (Figure 1).
Conflict events also correlate with areas dominated by members of the Pashtun ethnic group, but less so
Hazara areas, where the predominant ethnic group has largely supported the government and its Western
allies. Therefore, we also code whether the event occurred within five kilometers of a road, whether the
majority of residents are of Pashtun ethnicity or not, and whether the majority of residents are of Hazara
ethnicity or not.10
Finally, we include two attributes of the CERP projects beyond their type: duration and cost. These
two characteristics indicate each project’s size. Previous analyses of CERP data have found that project size
affects its effectiveness—smaller projects are understood to be better tailored to local needs, thus making
them more likely to improve living conditions and mitigate violence (Berman, Felter, Shapiro, and Troland
2013). Table 2 provides a summary of how these spatiotemporal variables are distributed across CERP
events.11 Appendix B shows that these matching variables correlate with project types and levels of violence.

Method
In order to test the argument that social protection projects will lead to relatively more insurgent activity
than infrastructure projects, we perform a Matched Wake Analysis, or MWA (Schutte and Donnay 2014).
MWA identifies natural experiments in precise spatiotemporal data by performing four steps. First, events
9 Data

on population are from the Gridded Population of the World database (http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpwv3-population-count). An urban environment is defined as an area within a 10 kilometer radius of the geographic center of each
city with a population of 100,000 or over. Urban data are from the Afghanistan Central Statistics Office (http://cso.gov.af/).
10 Road data were collected from the Afghanistan Information Management Services (http://www.aims.org.af/); ethnicity data
are from the GeoEPR dataset (see Wucherpfennig, Weidmann, Girardin, Cederman, and Wimmer 2011).
11 We do not match on measures of inequality or poverty because any effect of pre-existing inequality on insurgency would be
captured in the measured trends of pre-treatment insurgent violence (see Nepal, Bohara, and Gawande 2011; Blattman and
Annan 2016). However, knowing that nightlight emission, as observed by satellites, may be an indicator of both economic
conditions and the need for infrastructure projects (Cederman, Weidmann, and Bormann 2015), we explored including
nightlight emissions as a proxy for wealth (see Weidmann and Schutte 2017) and found that, in Afghanistan, nightlight
emission is highly correlated with urban areas. As a result, we omitted measures of nightlight emission while including
the urban measure. Furthermore, we do not match on incidences of aid being delivered by the major alternative program
implemented at the time, the National Solidary Program (NSP) (Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov 2013). The reason is
that, as Böhnke and Zürcher (2013: 420) note, the NSP was a massive program with a relatively even spatial spread. It
was designed to deliver aid to as many communities as possible, and most Afghan communities participated. Indeed, a
nationally-representative survey of Afghans shows that a majority of Afghans lived in a community with an NSP project
(Warren 2014). Finally, following the recommendation of a reviewer, we consider the effect of US troop presence, as done
in Sexton 2016. We include these data in a supplementary analysis, found in Appendix D, rather than the main analysis
because the observations of troop presence only begin during 2008—fours years after our own event dataset.

are divided into one of three categories: “treatment”, “control”, and “dependent”. Treatment and control
events are compared against one another. In this case, the two types of CERP projects are compared. The
dependent events are used to measure the effect of the treatment and control events; their frequency is
posited to be affected by these events. As explained above, dependent events in this case are all records in
SIGACT coded as “insurgent activity”.
Clearly, aid projects are not singular events, but rather protracted episodes of civilian-military collaboration. However, we analyze aid projects as events based on their start dates. As discussed earlier, residents
react to aid distribution once the manner of resource provision is announced via project initiation. In other
words, project initiation is an opportune time to study responses to what CERP projects signal to the
community.
In a second step, MWA establishes counts of treatment, control, and dependent events temporally prior
and posterior to all treatment and control events. For this count, only events within certain spatial and
temporal distances are taken into account, for example, within up to five days before and after the event
and up to five kilometers away from the actual CERP project site and date of implementation. The counts
of preceding events serve as matching variables in the subsequent step.
In a third step, MWA uses a matching algorithm, Coarsened Exact Matching (Iacus, King, and Porro
2012), to build samples of treatment and control events under otherwise most comparable conditions. Matching variables include the trend in preceding dependent events, counts of preceding treatment and control
events, and the spatial context information and event characteristics discussed in the preceding section.12
12 Matching

on counts of preceding treatment and control events is suggested by Schutte and Donnay (2014) to remedy a
limited of this empirical strategy. Namely, events of interest, such as newly started aid projects, can occur in close spatial

15

Constructing these matched samples paves the way for studying the effects of “treatment” events in isolation of confounding contextual factors. This way, the matching step helps identify natural experiments
in event data: changes in subsequent dependent events are calculated under otherwise most comparable
conditions.13 Treatment effects are estimated with a Difference-in-Differences regression design (Angrist and
Pischke 2009), that estimates the number of posterior events as a function of previous events and the binary
treatment indicator (Equation 1):
npost = β0 + β1 npre + β2 treatment + u

(1)

Finally, by systematically varying the temporal and spatial distances around CERP sites, the robustness
of any substantive effect for different spatial and temporal aggregations can be assessed. An illustration of
the inner workings of the method can be found in Appendix C.

Results
Initial insights into the effects of different CERP projects on subsequent conflict dynamics can be obtained
descriptively. Focusing on the intensity of conflict dynamics at a local level—two kilometer aggregations—
and ignoring previous trends, Figure 2 shows counts and standard deviations of insurgent activity for different
project types. Two effects are apparent in this simple analysis. First, social protection CERP projects are on
average associated with more subsequent insurgent activity than infrastructure projects. This observation is
in line with the theoretical expectation. However, it does not qualify as a full test of the theory as possibly
confounding conditions and preceding trends are ignored. A second noteworthy aspect is the linear increase
in insurgent activity after project initiation. A linear trend suggests that post-initiation conflict dynamics
do not systematically escalate in cycles of attacks and counterattacks, which would have imperiled causal
identification.
and temporal proximity to one another. This entails a violation of a central assumption of causal identification: identical
treatments across observations. Simply speaking, one would risk comparing the effect of one type of project with the combined
effect of two different types of projects that occurred in close spatial and temporal proximity. To mitigate this, matching on
previous counts of treatment and control events ensures that, for instance, control events that were preceded by one treatment
event are compared to treatment events that were preceded by one treatment event. We adopt this approach in our analysis
and report percentages of overlapping events in Table 3.
13 MWA aims to solve the identification challenge by matching on trends of violence and relevant variables. To the extent
that this strategy does not fully account for selection, we must assume that the implementation of CERP project types was
not primarily driven by preceding violent events. This assumption is supported by the limited research on project selection.
Adams (2015) uses interviews with US military officers utilizing CERP funds in Afghanistan to report that the officers selected
projects based on “local [civilian] needs” and “mobilizing local governance”. Moreover, none of the respondents believed that
CERP projects improved stability. That is, the projects were not seen as viable responses to previous insurgent violence.

Figure 2: Average counts of insurgent activity after project initiation
Note: The solid lines show average counts of insurgent activity for over time, beginning with project initiation.
Events occurred within two kilometers of the project site. Dashed lines correspond to one standard deviation
in counts.
As a first inferential test of our theoretical expectations, we conduct a simplified MWA; none of the contextual variables are included in the matching process. This establishes the basic effects of social protection
versus infrastructure aid projects on subsequent insurgent activity for multiple spatial and temporal levels
of aggregation. Specifically, we examine changes in insurgent activity for aggregations ranging from two to
10 kilometers from the CERP project site and temporal aggregations from two to 20 days after the project
started. Our theoretical framework focuses our attention on intra-community conflict dynamics captured
in small aggregations—two to four kilometers, for example—but the substantive results also hold for larger
scales.14 As discussed earlier, we begin the MWA comparisons with the initiation of projects. The start of
14 Spatial

aggregations smaller than two kilometers would very likely not generate meaningful insights because there are few
insurgent events that almost exactly coincide spatially (or temporally) with projects. Analyzing larger spatial and temporal

a project signals to the community what type of aid is being implemented, which then triggers assessments
of exclusion and subsequent grievances (Chandrasekaran 2012; Böhnke and Zürcher 2013; Malkasian 2013;
Martin 2014).
In this first baseline test, we find support for our argument. When matching only on the preceding trend
of insurgent activity, insurgent actions following relatively exclusive social protection projects increase in
comparison to infrastructure projects. Figure 3 depicts estimated effects at various levels of aggregation as
a contour plot. Clear areas correspond to significant results for the estimated treatment effect at the 0.05
level. We see that the estimated effect of social protection projects, relative to infrastructure projects, peaks
at around 0.45 for larger aggregations.
In the direct proximity of aid projects (i.e., two kilometer aggregations), we find effects ranging from 0.1
to 0.2 for different temporal windows. This suggests that, at the local level, one out of five social protection
projects causes an incident of insurgent activity, compared to infrastructure projects. Remarkably, the results
are very robust to changes in the temporal and spatial aggregations and appear positive and significant for
most areas of the plot. Thus, this first analysis offers evidence for a robust positive effect of relatively
exclusive CERP projects on the trend of insurgent activity.
Up to this point, however, the analysis is agnostic to the possible effects of confounding contextual factors.
It could be that the two types of projects are implemented under systematically different circumstances that
could also cause different levels of subsequent violence. To address this, we conduct a second analysis that
includes the spatiotemporal variables in the matching of observations. We now observe the effects of different
types of aid projects under otherwise comparable circumstances.15
How do the results change once population levels, elevation, information on the predominant ethnic group
at the project site, road proximity, urban proximity, and the cost and duration of the project are taken into
account? As Figure 4 shows, the estimated effects of social protection projects are still largely positive.
aggregations than 10 kilometers and 20 days would be substantively interesting, but this is empirically not feasible based on
the chosen design. Larger spatial and temporal aggregations of 100 days and 100 kilometers, for example, would contain too
many overlapping events: we would be unable to differentiate the effects of different projects on overall levels of insurgent
activity. Such overlap in observations clearly runs counter to the quasi-experimental logic underlying the analysis. For a more
technical discussion of this problem and possible remedies see Schutte and Donnay (2014).
15 Another possible approach would entail modeling the effects of the introduced variables in a multivariate regression model.
This would requires careful explicit choices for the functional forms of the proposed relationships between independent and
dependent variables. For such an analysis, these choices would have to be justified for all spatial and temporal levels of
aggregation. In contrast, our matching approach allows us to remain agnostic to functional forms and automated matching
ensures that balance improvements are achieved for all levels of aggregation.

Figure 3: Contour plot of the effect of exclusive aid projects on insurgent activity without matching on spatiotemporal variables
Note: In the clear areas, the estimate is
significant at the p < 0.05 level. In areas
covered by dashed cross-hatching, it is significant at p < 0.1. In areas with solid
cross-hatching the estimate is not significant. Note that the estimates are predominantly positive (ranging from zero to 0.45)
at all considered levels of aggregation.

Figure 4: Contour plot of the effect of exclusive aid projects on insurgent activity with
matching on spatiotemporal variables Note:
Matching is now done on population size,
elevation, road proximity, urban proximity, Pashtun region, Hazara region, project
cost, and project duration. Note that the
results are less robust to changes in spatial and temporal aggregations, but they remain positive and significant for small spatial aggregations (up to two kilometers) and
different temporal aggregations.

For the aggregation level we interpret as most indicative of intra-community dynamics, two kilometers, the
results remain substantively similar as the baseline test across temporal aggregations. In other words, the
introduction of relatively exclusive CERP projects continue to cause an increase in subsequent insurgent
activity at the local level, compared to the implementation of a more inclusive infrastructure project.16
The effect remains positive for larger spatial aggregations, although mostly not significant.17 This broader
non-significance at bigger spatial aggregations underscores the local nature of identified conflict dynamics.
While Figure 3 and Figure 4 communicate the main findings of the analysis at one glance, additional
information and detailed results can be found in Table 3. Beyond the estimated effects, the most important
insight communicated in this table is that matching improves the empirical sample: the similarity of social
protection and infrastructure projects in the sample increases as a function of the introduced matching variables. These improvements are communicated through a measure of multivariate similarity, the percentage

arrive at similar results in a supplementary analysis that matches on the presence of US soldiers (Appendix D).
intriguing exception is the positive and significant effect across spatial aggregations at the four-day temporal window.

of “common support” (%CS).18 Common support increases at about three to five percentage points in the
interpreted areas, indicating that the overlap of the joint distributions of the matching variables between
treatment and control group improved.19
Returning to the substantive discussion of the results, estimates that are all positive and largely robust to
changes in spatial and temporal aggregations align with first-hand accounts from Afghanistan’s conflict zones
and our theoretical expectation. In sum, they provide support for our argument: third-party aid projects that
empower, enrich, or benefit a specific and limited segment of a local population—even if the beneficiaries are
marginalized residents—result in greater subsequent insurgent activity, relative to comparatively inclusive
aid projects.

Note: This table presents detailed MWA results based on all matching variables. Note that matching always
increases common support (%CS). Most importantly, overlapping events (the “SO” and “MO” columns)
peak at about 30% for the interpreted areas of the plot. While not ideal, these levels of overlap are also not
prohibitively large. See Schutte and Donnay 2014 for a corresponding discussion.
18 Iacus,

King, and Porro (2012) introduce common support as a measure for the ranges of variable values jointly represented
in both groups.
19 Small but persistent levels of spatiotemporal overlaps of observations also suggest the results should be cautiously interpreted
(see Schutte and Donnay 2014). Ultimately, however, we have analyzed the available data with a focus on causal inference and
changes in trends—while minimizing aggregation and maximizing geographic coverage over multiple years of warfare—and
found clear support for a positive effect of relatively exclusive projects on local-level patterns in insurgent activity.

20

Discussion
Our findings indicate that local aid projects, such as those widely used to “win hearts and minds” in
Afghanistan and Iraq, can be both a source of contentment and contestation, depending on their exclusivity.
This conclusion fits with key insights from first-hand accounts of wartime development efforts (e.g., Fishstein
and Wilder 2012; Malkasian 2013; Martin 2014), behavioral economics (e.g., Camerer and Thaler 1995;
Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze 1982), and a recent renaissance of grievance-based explanations for the
onset of high-risk collective action in ethnic civil war (e.g., Buhaug, Cederman, and Rød 2008; Cederman,
Gleditsch, and Buhaug 2013; Wimmer 2013). Our analysis contributes to this body of scholarship by
examining similar dynamics of exclusion and conflict, first, across the entirety of Afghanistan—over several
years—and, second, at the local and event levels.
Development aid can, of course, spur insurgent violence in other ways. Two prominent arguments, predation and territorial loss, emphasize insurgents’ violent reaction to aid programs. These insurgent-centered
explanations and our argument are not mutually exclusive; specific outbursts of violence can have distinct
causes. Yet, our findings provide stronger support for the dynamics of exclusion rather than alternatives.
Namely, if violence was driven by insurgents trying to capture resources, as the predation scholarship argues
(Grossman 1991), then attacks should have increased after infrastructure projects. These projects offered
more valuable contestable material—for example, construction equipment versus blankets delivered by social
protection projects—and a greater increase in the revenue of localities available for extortion by insurgents
(Dube and Vargas 2013).20 Similarly, we should have also observed infrastructure projects increase violence
if insurgents were responding to territorial loss: a larger portion of the population would have benefited
from infrastructure projects, leading to more information being shared, resulting in more territorial loss,
and, eventually, more violence (Weintraub 2016). In sum, while alternative processes of insurgent reaction
(i.e., predation and territorial loss arguments) and civilians’ rational calculus (i.e., information-sharing and
opportunity costs arguments) are bound to influence conflict in some settings, our analysis underscores how
intra-community social exclusion shapes conflict.
20 Furthermore,

the vast majority of insurgent activities involved planting IEDs, not kidnapping, which Dube and Vargas (2013)
highlight as a key way for rapacious insurgents to capture local revenue.

21

Limitations
Our study is not without limitations. Chief among these is that we do not observe the motivations of insurgents themselves, although this is a common limitation in studies of contemporary insurgencies. Similarly, we
cannot distinguish among the specific micro-mechanisms that link grievances and support or participation
for violence. This process may be driven by a superficial instrumental reaction—say, attacking a rival—
or resentment over an inequitable distribution of resources. Nevertheless, the crucial insight is the same:
exclusion, generated inadvertently by aid provision, can trigger a process among individuals and within
communities that ends in political violence.
Three other limitations are more technical. First, the MWA procedure permits analyses only at aggregations of a few days and several kilometers; larger spatiotemporal windows contain too many overlapping
events. As a result, our study provides insights on immediate-term conflict dynamics, although, as we have
discussed, there are sound theoretical reasons to do so. Future research, described in more detail below, could
extend the analysis to projects’ lifetimes and bridge our findings to medium-term conflict dynamics. Second,
while we have carefully selected our matching variables and observe balance improvements, we acknowledge
the possibility of not achieving sufficient balance on unobserved factors.
Third, we do not compare CERP projects to other aid programs operating in Afghanistan. This decision
is based partly on the fact that the major alternative program, the NSP, was roughly evenly distributed
across the country (Böhnke and Zürcher 2013). However, there is also a methodological consideration:
comparing CERP projects to projects in other programs would entail an assumption of stable treatment
effects across very differently designed programmatic aid efforts. Thus far, the literature is largely silent on
the validity of such an assumption.

Future research
Despite these limitations, we have confidence in our study’s insights due to the alignment between our
empirical findings and both the rich qualitative secondary literature and recent theoretical advances. Indeed,
we see the study’s limitations as pointing to important areas for future research.
The first two directly address our technical limitations. Further research is needed to compare the various

22

different aid programs—not just types of aid—that are launched in conflict and post-conflict settings. Such
comparisons are becoming increasingly common (e.g., Blattman and Ralston 2015), but have been lacking
in much of the extant scholarship. A second area for future work would be to link our findings regarding
the immediate-term with impacts at medium-temporal ranges (Cederman and Vogt 2017). In fact, our
findings have direct implications for medium-range conflict dynamics. Namely, if locally-delivered aid divides
communities into multiple aggrieved, anti-state factions, the increasing fracturization can independently
further intensify conflict (Metternich, Dorff, Gallop, Weschle, and Ward 2013).
A third area for future work would bridge our findings of aid’s negative impact on conflict at the local
level (and similar findings at sub-national levels in, e.g., Crost, Felter, and Johnston 2014; Beath, Christia,
and Enikolopov 2016; Sexton 2016) with the large literature at the macro-level that finds a pacifying effect
of aid (e.g., Nielsen et al. 2011; Savun and Tirone 2011; Gutting and Steinwand 2017). Of course, this
latter scholarship often analyzes bilateral aid disbursements, pools together various types of aid (e.g., aid to
government institutions, aid to civil society groups, aid for infrastructure and development), and does not
explicitly differentiate between local and national level projects, but, nevertheless, the contradictory findings
allude to potentially fruitful discovery. One starting point may be Böhnke and Zürcher’s (2013) intriguing
finding that local aid bolsters the state’s legitimacy among the populace. Perhaps aid causes immediate-term
violent reactions while more slowly cultivating state legitimacy, resulting in a long-term pacifying effect.

Conclusion
By developing a local-level, population-centric argument for how third-party wartime aid influences conflict
dynamics and analyzing events using recently developed quasi-experimental methods for spatiotemporal
data, we find that aid projects affect local conflict in systematically different ways. Relatively exclusive aid,
proxied by social protection CERP projects, has a robust positive effect on subsequent insurgent activity,
compared to relatively inclusive projects. These findings extend a growing body of literature on grievancebased explanations for conflict dynamics to the more micro levels of the locality and individuals.
Importantly, in the case of Afghanistan, we show that such effects are an inadvertent result of incumbents
attempts to mitigate insurgency. We thus offer a theoretically driven and empirically based answer to the
23

current debate on the efficacy of counterinsurgency practices, such as CERP projects. Our answer points
to the careful consideration that must accompany the use of develop- mental aid as a policy instrument for
reducing violence and insecurity during ongoing irregular conflicts. Put in a different way, our studys insights
not only shed light on how conflict can fuel further conflict, but also serve as a reminder that well-intentioned
aid projects can have adverse effects when they exclude non-recipients. Taking these adverse effects into
account for the design of humanitarian projects and stabilizing missions seems advisable in the light of the
presented evidence.

CERP project descriptions and topic modeling

We identify CERP projects used in Afghanistan (2004–09) through each project’s Afghanistan National
Development Strategy (ANDS) label and corresponding ANDS definition (GIROA 2008). Yet, to gain
confidence in our interpretation of the ANDS labels and understanding of the projects, we analyze the
natural language descriptions of each project using LDA topic models (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Mohr
and Bogdanov 2013). In other words, the goal is to evaluate the similarity between a category label and
the project descriptions included under the label.
To do so, we extract all the natural language descriptions for projects labeled “social protection”. This
collection is treated a distinct corpus. We prepare the textual data in this corpus using standard preprocessing
procedures: all terms are stemmed; capitalized letters are converted to lower case; and numbers, special
characters, punctuation marks, and common English stop-words are removed (Grimmer and Stewart 2013).
We then model five topics. These topics provide evidence for whether the terms comprising the corpus
reflect the associated label. Table 1 in the main text shows these five topics, as well as the six words most
associated with these topics and the proportion of these topics in the ”social protection” corpus. This process
is repeated for the descriptions of projects labeled as “infrastructure and natural resources”.
Table 4 presents summary statistics of the projects’ descriptions. We see that the descriptions for the
1,147 social protection projects sum to 17,408 words, with an average of 15.24 words per description. The
text allocated to infrastructure and natural resource projects is similar: a total of 21,357 words, with a mean
of 14.41 words per description.

Violence and project type as a function of matching variables

Table 5 presents a negative binomial regression model (Model 1) indicating that levels of violence prior to
project initiation can be regressed on the structural variables utilized in the matching procedure. Please
note that the sample contains multiple observations for each CERP project for different spatial and temporal
aggregations. Aggregation levels are included as covariates. Model 2 shows that the type of ANDS projects
chosen can also be regressed on the structural variables. Models 3 and 4 include district-level fixed effects.

Illustration of the MWA analysis

Figure 5 illustrates the MWA procedure. In a first step, observations are joined with geographic information
via nearest neighbor mapping. In a second step, previous and posterior instances of “dependent” events
are counted. In step three, observations are matched with regards to previous events, event trends, and
geographic information. The method of choice in this procedure is coarsened exact matching. Finally in step
four, the treatment effect on the dependent variable is established in a Difference-in-Differences regression
design for the matched sample. Figure taken with permission from Schutte and Donnay (2014).

Matching on troop presence

One anonymous reviewer suggested that matching on Sexton’s (2016) variable of US troop-presence levels
would strengthen the empirical analysis. We have reviewed Sexton’s data and can attest to its high quality.
However, for our specific application, the data come with important caveats. Chief among these is that
the temporal resolution is specified at the week-level. For the short-term analysis, soldiers could arrive
post-treatment and matching on post-treatment conditions is certainly not advisable. In addition, the data
is only available at the district-level. The districts of Afghanistan range in geographic size and population
from tens to hundreds of square kilometers and thousands to tens of thousands of inhabitants. Finally, the
corresponding article indicates that the data collection starts in mid-2008. This is more than four years after
the first observation in our dataset; there are only two years of overlap.
Despite these problems, we have included Sexton’s binary troop-presence indicator in the matching procedure and ran a basic MWA on the remaining 26,192 observations. The results are shown in Figure 6. The
local (i.e., two kilometer) positive effect of social protection CERP projects on subsequent conflict activity
remains significant across the majority of temporal aggregations. These findings align with our main results
and provide further evidence in support of our argument.

Note: Matching is done on binary measure of the presence of US soldiers. The sample used in this analysis
differs from the main analysis because of non-overlapping years of observation. In the clear areas, the
estimate is significant at the p < 0.05 level. In areas covered by dashed cross-hatching, it is significant at p
< 0.1. In areas with solid cross-hatching the estimate is not significant.
