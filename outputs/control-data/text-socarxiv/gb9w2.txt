"6" "An analysis of the congressional record was done and has seen a recent drop off in selected scientific terms.  Possible solutions to increase scientific discussion to help instruct legislation is discussed."
"7" "The United States populace and Congress have become increasingly politically divided in the last two decades based on a variety of metrics ( Hooghe  and  Oser  2017; Van Boven, Judd, and Sherman 2012; Westfall et al. 2015).  For Congress to discuss solutions with less vitriol, a shared framework to base arguments around “truths” is required.  Historically media outlets, mainly newspapers, have been relied on to fact check and analyze issues currently being discussed in Congress, however news organizations are now viewed as partisan by many ( Elejalde ,  Ferres , and Herder 2018).  Scientific statements and investigation could serve as a foundation of “truth” due to its uniqueness in the political dialogue, in that those statements are based on experiments and observations which can be repeated to prove or disprove their claims.   Scientific consensus could increase dialogue and successful legislative passage and impact.  An analysis of the congressional record was done and has seen a recent drop off in selected scientific terms.  Possible solutions to increase scientific discussion to help instruct legislation is discussed."
"8" "The increase in knowledge, let alone data, about our world is growing exponentially, while civilization’s institutions ability to utilize this information is not.  One of the most likely ways to increase scientific dialogue within the chambers of the United States Congress would be to have more  congresspeople  that are scientists, the subset in society that is the most trained to utilize this information.  Having scientists on congressional panels could help in issues ranging from electronic voting, patent durations and intellectual property (IP) trade disputes, carbon emissions & sequestration, nuclear power and storage, and national security (e.g. functionality of GPS, radar, lasers).  Organizations have developed to promote scientists entering policy.  For example, 314 Action  (a geeky nod to the number Pi) is an organization and platform specifically created to help scientists transition or run for office ( http://www.314action.org/home/ ).  Historically, very few PhD scientists in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine) have been representatives or senators, with the most common profession being lawyers."
"9" "The list of fields which should be categorized as STEM has been debated over the last couple decades.  While all agree on the core STEM fields listed earlier, the NSF (NSF, 2018) and others have broadened it to include fields such as social sciences (e.g. public policy), computer science, and STEM education.  Scientists can be brought in as expert witnesses to help inform Congress, although legal scholars could likewise help inform congressional scientists.  In November 2018, Dave Bret lost re-election, so the number of PhDs in classical STEM fields dropped to two; Jerry McGuire in mathematics and Bill Foster in physics.  There are six times as many  congresspeople  that have no educational degree beyond a high school diploma.  The number of PhD STEM degrees increases to seven when psychology and political science are included (Table-1, Figure-3).  Note, there are 21  congresspeople  with PhDs in congress (Figure-4) but many of those are not in STEM fields.  If a congress person was found to have received an honorary PhD that was not listed as a degree they attained (e.g. Greg  Gianforte  has an honorary doctorate from Montana State University's College of Engineering).  There were an impressive 7 Bachelor of Science (BS) STEM degree candidates which defeated incumbents in the 2018 election, (5 democratic and 2 republican) (Table-1, Figure-3)."
"10" "Doctors (MD or DO) have to interact with continually changing scientific knowledge and are sometimes grouped with STEM fields.  The STEM fields educate people to analyze data and create new knowledge.  Under that paradigm, physicians are usually classified outside of STEM as practitioners most often use knowledge from STEM fields.  There are now 16 MD’s in congress and they are shown in Table-1 and Figure-3.  We then screened for  congresspeople  whose highest level of education ended in a STEM, which added 23 people to Table-1.  Lastly, we cataloged who had also attained an MBA degree.  If you include doctors, dentists, and nurses the number congress people increases significantly and a full list of congressional education background we created can be found at  http://bit.ly/2019CongressEd .   There are many  congresspeople  that had undergrad STEM degrees but went on to attain advanced non-STEM degrees, such as law degrees (JD) (Figure-4), but these people are not listed in Table-1.  Of note, doctors were included in the Table-1 but dentists were not, which was decided based on the list of doctors having mostly STEM undergraduate training, while dentists did not."

"380" "The  congresspeople  with non-doctor STEM degrees are about 2/3rds Democrats, however there are many more Republican doctors in congress which make the  complete list of  congresspeople   with broader STEM degrees in Table-1 roughly half Democrats and half Republicans.  The frequently repeated clip where the panel of Republicans unanimously deny climate change has presented a stereotype, painting all republicans as anti-science, when the Republican voters hold a less homogenous view.  For example, the “heartland” of America,  an area of the country that mostly affiliates with the  Republican Party, has genetically modified crops stretching across it, with farmers actively following the research of seed modification from year to year.  They are literally investing their future in next year’s seed technology, which has increased acreage harvested per farm worker with less pesticide use (Osteen and Fernandez-Cornejo 2013).  Agricultural biotech is a multi-billion dollar market, with Fortune 500 companies Monsanto and Dupont making genetic modifications with the same scientific rigor as a tier 1 research university or pharmaceutical firm."
"381" "The congressional legislation was searched at  https://congress.gov/advanced-search/command-line , using syntax such as ( legislativeSource :\"Legislation\" AND  committee:\"Science , Space, and Technology\" AND \"National Academy of Science\" ) , to ascertain the historical trend in how scientifically focused"
"382" "legislation has been implemented over the last 50 years (Figure-2).  Legislation coming out of the Science, Space and Technology Committee was searched using the terms: National Academy of Science, environment, climate change, renewable, science technology engineering and math, and clean coal.  Figure-2 shows what percent of legislation had these terms over roughly the last 50 years (from 1973 through 2017).  Both legislation introduced and legislation being approved out of the House is shown, with lines colored according to which party had control of the House of Representatives at that time.  Three upticks in legislation with scientific terms were seen in early 90’s , early 2000’s, and late 2000’s which had alternating political control in the House of Representatives being Democratic, Republican, and Democratic, respectively (Figure-2).  Some terms were more likely to be in proposed legislation compared to legislation that passed the House, such as “clean coal” and “environment”.  On the other hand, the term “National Academies” was more often in bills that passed the House, than in total bills proposed (Figure-2).  Measuring scientific inclusion in congressional legislation could serve as a reporting structure to the populace and an incentive for Congress to weigh scientific consensus more.  While blunt word search can fail to capture if the legislation is pro- or anti-scientific consensus,  it is usually safe to assume most legislation with “National Academy of Science” is pro-science in that the term is used to cite or fund the scientific community."
"383" "The U.S. Senate is much less representative of the population due to the wide disparity in populations per state, and was therefore not screened for historical legal word inclusion.  However, it is worthy to note that the Senate also appears to be undergoing a historically relevant polarization, as detailed in Figure-1."

"386" "There is no easy solution for moving the country toward uniformly respecting scientific consensus.  Transparency and shared platforms, such as presidential debates, can provide a uniform national dialogue that can start to bring disparate members of political parties closer together.  Politicians are increasingly choosing to appear in their echo chambers (e.g. MSNBC or FOX News), whereas scientists are trained in an environment that promotes peer review, presenting data to defend their stances, and complete transparency.  Creating transparency of candidates stances and rationale, such as the Science Debate has done recently, is only as effective as the audience it reaches.  Educating our populace with facts, as well as a fair analysis of those facts is one of the most pressing issues of our time.  Multiple institutions have the possibility to make systemic changes which could incentivize STEM PhD’s to run for political office.  For example:"
"387" "Universities - could make legislative community outreach part of the service component for promotions."
"388" "Industry - could have paid leave for STEM PhD employees to run for office."
"389" "Congresspeople  - could hire STEM PhD staff from bordering districts, to enable training them while allowing them a political space to run for office without competition within the team."
"390" "National STEM societies continue to invest in policy fellowships to train their members to move into the political arena (e.g. American Association For the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Fellows , National Academy of Science (NAS)  Mirzayan  Policy Fellows, American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB)).  Most of these solutions to increase PhDs in congress need to be sustained, long term efforts."
