Abstract
The importance of money in elections is a hallmark of contemporary democracies. In
this paper, we study how investment capacity, defined as the resources remaining after
the municipality perform the mandatory expenditures, influences elections in Brazil.
We theorize that when a politician wins the election in a low investment capacity
municipality, this generates commitment problems, as new mayors are unable to reward
the firms that contributed to their campaigns, influencing the next elections. We test
these claims by considering a close-elections regression discontinuity design coupled
with heterogeneous quantile effects for Brazilian municipalities between 2000 and 2012.
We find that incumbent mayors in towns with low investment capacity receive less
campaign donation afterward and are more disadvantaged in their reelection contests.
The results are robust to design variations and changes in party labels or mayoral
characteristics. Our findings have implications for the influence of money on politics
in democratic countries.

Introduction

The importance of money in elections is a hallmark of contemporary democracies. Money
has a prominent role in elections, as campaign costs have increased dramatically across the
world (Scarrow, 2007). Campaign resources grant candidates strategic advantages, and in
places with less ideological attachment, they are crucial to convincing voters. Politicians
with extra funds can then have a considerable advantage over others (Samuels, 2001b; Speck
and Mancuso, 2014). However, most of the papers on money and politics focus either on
the electoral process (Jacobson, 1978; Gelman and King, 1990; Hainmueller and Kern, 2008;
Fink, 2012) or on the governing stage (Besley and Persson, 2009; d’Agostino et al., 2016;
Rubin, 2019). This focus narrows down the richness of the interplay between money and
politics.
In this paper, we remedy this gap by studying the money and elections nexus as a
full cycle: money starts influence at the beginning of the election when politicians promise
services to firms in exchange of campaign donations (Boas et al., 2014). Upon winning the
election, politicians may or may not reward firms with public procurement and contracts.
After the governing stage, a new electoral cycle starts, and firms have again the opportunity
to give for campaigns, either contributing to incumbents or challengers. Elections take place
and the full cycle restarts, as most democracies in the world have regular electoral cycles.
Although the election-government cycle is well defined, it is difficult to predict how
politicians and real-world conditions will affect the governments. On the one hand, politicians
might be rent seekers, oriented only toward short-term office perks, instead of trying to build
a successful political career (Kitschelt, 2000; Tollison, 2004). In this case, they may choose to
exert no effort to provide services. On the other hand, candidates could form incorrect beliefs
about the resources available for service provision (Brender and Drazen, 2008). Once in office,
they may realize that they cannot invest in services the amount previously planned before
the elections. In both scenarios, voters may not obtain the same amount of public goods
2

and firms that donated for the politicians’ campaigns will not receive back their donations
in terms of contracts and procurement. This could motivate both voters and firms to punish
the incumbent politicians in their next election, explaining the incumbency disadvantage and
why incumbents receive fewer campaign donations than challengers in developing countries.
To test these ideas, we leverage quasi-experimental evidence using a close-election regression discontinuity design in Brazilian municipalities, between 2000 and 2012. We show
that incumbents receive 4.70% less electoral donations than challengers, and have 8.14% less
chance of getting reelected. To understand the role of investment capacity, we look at the
ratio between the personnel expenditure and the municipal revenue. We divide the sample
into quantiles, median and quartiles, exploiting the heterogeneous effects in the regression
discontinuity design. Dividing in quantiles has the advantage of splitting the power equally
among the categories. We find that in municipalities below the median in investment capacity, mayors receive 9.68% fewer campaign contributions and have 14.36% less chance of
being reelected. Above the median in both indicators, the campaign contributions and the
incumbency disadvantage becomes insignificant. The results also hold for quartiles, with the
advantage of providing a clearer picture of the relationship. Therefore, investment capacity
connects the money-in-elections with the money-in-government, explaining how investments
while in government affect the electoral marketplace.

Investment capacity in the electoral marketplace

Most of the public service provision depends on an interaction between bureaucracy, firms,
and politicians. To obtain electoral support, politicians make pre-electoral informal agreements with firms (Arvate et al., 2013). In exchange to campaign donations, politicians offer
to firms privileged access to government contracts in the post-election period (Boas et al.,
2014; Fonseca, 2017). However, the politician’s ability to make their promises credible depends on government investment capacity (Samuels, 2001a). Thus, investment capacity is
3

directly connected with the electoral marketplace.
To clarify, consider the following theoretical argument on the role of investment capacity
in the electoral cycle. Suppose a polity with two types of politicians: career politicians,
that want to build a political career and opportunistic politicians that want to harness the
advantages of the public office, paying little effort for service provision. These types are
the politicians’ private information, but they reflect in different office behavior: in an institutional setting where there are only two terms (or any limited amount of terms), career
politicians will try to provide the maximum amount of services, regardless of being lameducks. However, opportunistic politicians will only provide services enough to get reelected
in their first terms, providing no services in their lame-duck terms. Firms, on the other hand,
want to donate for campaigns, but they expect to receive contracts and procurement in the
future, what needs a steady service provision. Therefore, firms prefer career politicians,
but they cannot credibly signal their type in the first term. In this setting, more investment capacity increases the firms’ benefits in the first term, compensating for an eventual
opportunistic politician in the second term. Thus, in municipalities with lower investment
capacity, lame-duck politicians will receive fewer campaign donations from firms and will
tend to be disadvantaged in their reelection. However, higher investment capacity makes the
first term so lucrative, that compensates a risky donation for lame-duck politicians.
The Brazilian context provides an ideal ground for empirically testing the effects of investment capacity on the electoral marketplace. Brazil is comprised of over five thousand
municipalities, each presenting a wide variation across the country. The federalist arrangement concentrates most of the taxation in the federal government, making transfers from
the central government relevant to the local level service provision (Arretche, 2010). Municipalities only collect five percent of the total tax share, but these revenues are essential
to investments in infrastructure, such as paved streets, schools, hospitals, and other construction projects. Also, until 2015, before a decision by the Federal Supreme Court which

4

banned market campaigns donations, firms were the leading donors in elections. From 1994
to 2016, on average, 85% of the money used by politicians in the Brazilian elections came
from firms’ campaign donations, while this percentage is 65% in the Argentinian and 45%
in the Chilean cases (Speck, 2016).

Empirical Strategy

In this section, we discuss the data sources, the estimation strategy, and the validity checks
for the design. First, we use three primary data sources. We collect the vote shares, reelection data, mayoral party labels, and campaign donations from the Brazilian Superior
Electoral Tribunal (TSE). This court is responsible for the elections in Brazil. They keep
website records for elections since 1946, with campaign donations and candidates’ income
data since 1994. Our dataset is comprised of four elections, spanning from 2000 to 2012. In
this paper, we considered only municipalities with less than 200 thousand registered voters,
with are the municipalities without a runoff in the mayoral elections. From the Superior Electoral Tribunal candidates’ database, we also consider the candidates’ age, gender, education,
employment sector, and party labels.
We collect the investment capacity data from the Brazilian Institute of Applied Economics
(IPEA), that have municipal fiscal indicators from 1985 to 2011. We compute the ratio
between personnel expenditure and revenue. An increase in this indicator means that mayors
have less disposable income to invest in service provision. We look into the inverse of this
ratio, to make an increase in this indicator to represent increasing investment capacity.
As robustness to the investment capacity indicator, we also consider in the Online Appendix an indicator of municipal liquidity, computed by the Rio de Janeiro Industrial Federation (Firjan). The reader can check that our results are robust to changes in the investment
capacity indicator. The final database has 31,912 observations.
Regarding the identification and estimation, our unit of analysis is the candidates within
5

municipalities in a given year. As candidates are unable to manipulate the vote share they
will receive precisely, the electoral winner and loser candidates become an as-if exogenous
variation, the closer the vote share results. This strategy is known as close election regression
discontinuity design and helps us to identify the effects of incumbency on future campaign
donations and reelection rates (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008; Lee, 2008). Our running variable
that assigns the treatment or control status is the vote margin difference between the two
most voted candidates. To take care of the endogeneity in the decision to run again for office,
we use Magalhães (2015) strategy, that guarantees that we measure the outcome effects,
even when rerunning is not widespread. Hence, we estimate the incumbency effect on the
probability of receiving campaign finance resources from firms unconditional to whether a
candidate is indeed rerunning in the next election.
We use a local-linear polynomial estimator with a triangular kernel weight distance from
the cutoff, and we compute the optimal bandwidth using both the Calonico et al. (2014)
Mean-Squared error robust data-driven optimal bandwidth. We cluster all standard errors
at the municipal-year, as the close election source of randomness occurs in this level.
Finally, the validity of our causal claim relies on two assumptions, which we show that
hold in the Online Appendix. First, all the pre-treatment covariates (candidate parties,
candidates professions, gender, and age), are smooth around the discontinuity. Second, to
show that there are no signs of manipulation, which would mean fraud in this context, we
use McCrary (2008) and Cattaneo et al. (2018) manipulation estimators.

Investment capacity, campaign donations, and the
incumbency disadvantage

We study three outcomes: the chances of being elected before (as a placebo test), the
recipiency of campaign donations, and a reelection indicator. We disaggregate the analysis

6

using the inverse of the budget share spend with personnel, as an indicator of investment
capacity.
The close election strategy is efficient to study the effects of winning an election on
the next electoral term. However, it is insufficient to study the heterogeneous effects that
investment capacity has over incumbency. To solve this problem, we rerun the regression
discontinuity analysis, split the sample into the median and quartiles of investment capacity.
Splitting the sample between the median or the quartiles has two advantages: first, the
brackets represent low versus higher investment capacity. Second, cuts are arbitrary, and
they split the sample into size equally powered. This strategy allows us to investigate the
heterogeneous effect of fiscal capacity on campaign donations and incumbency. Figure 1
presents the coefficients in the RDD models for the full data, and then splitting by median
of investment capacity.

In Figure 1, the rows represent outcomes while the columns, the full data and the het7

erogeneous effect in investment capacity. The first row has the placebo tests, where we
investigate the incumbency effects on the previous and unrelated elections. As expected for
a placebo test, all models were statistically insignificant.
The second row estimates the effects of incumbency on campaign donations in the reelection contest. If our theoretical argument is correct, the incumbents should receive fewer
campaign donations in municipalities with lower investment capacity. In the full dataset, the
chances of receiving donations drop 0.047 (p-value < 0.001). When we split the sample by
median of investment capacity, incumbents in municipalities above the investment capacity
median in inverse expenditure over revenue decrease the chance of receiving donations by
0.028 (p-value = 0.078). Below the median investment capacity, the campaign donations
decrease considerably, by 0.059 (p-value < 0.001) fewer donations (around 6% less). Thus,
in municipalities with low investment capacity, incumbent mayors tend to receive twice as
fewer campaign donations.
The last row presents the incumbency disadvantage, measured by looking into the candidates that were reelected or not in the coming election. In the full dataset, the chances of
being reelected drop by 0.081 (p-value < 0.001). This result corroborates the incumbency
disadvantage findings by (Klašnja and Titiunik, 2017). When we split the sample by median
of investment capacity, mayors in municipalities above the investment capacity median have
0.046 (p-value = 0.016) less chance of getting reelected. Below the median investment capacity, the incumbency disadvantage increases considerably, to 0.102 (p-value < 0.001). These
results represent a drop in reelection rates of 2.21 times more incumbency disadvantage in
municipalities with low investment capacity.
One critical point of our estimates is their reliance on the median as an arbitrary threshold. If our theoretical argument is correct, every subsample that is increasing in investment
capacity should present changes in donations and incumbency disadvantage similar to the
last results. To test for this possibility, we split the sample by quartiles of the investment

Figure 2: Investment capacity, campaign donations, and incumbency: main results by quartiles
Figure 2 shows that for low investment capacity, the results are significant and they show
a monotonous relationship for both donations and incumbency disadvantage. Investment
capacity impacts profoundly in the electoral marketplace: conditional on win an election,
candidates that were ex-ante similar, will then have a lower chance of receiving donations
and a lower chance of reelection.
In the Online companion, we test the robustness of the findings. We run five types of
complementary models. First, the same result for different measures of investment capacity,
to check whether the results are consistent across different measures of the same phenomenon.
Second, we add the pre-treatment covariates as controls and rerun the main regressions.
Third, we run a sensitivity test for varying the threshold using placebo thresholds. Fourth,
we run a sensitivity analysis for the bandwidth size, ranging from 50% to 200% of the optimal
bandwidth. Finally, we run a sensitivity analysis for the choice of the polynomial degree.
The results remain robust to these specifications.

Conclusion

Money has a broader influence in democracies, going beyond the electoral period. Closer to
the election, money correlates with the politicians’ electoral chances. After the election, the
government success depends on the capacity to government investment in public service provision. These dynamics affect the electoral perspectives of incumbents, and we may expect it
to correlate with the politicians’ efforts while in office. In this sense, investment (in)capacity
influences the electoral marketplace by lowering incumbents resources and chances of getting
reelected.
We contribute with three strands of the literature and have a profound implication for
developing democracies. First, our argument complements the previous research on incumbency disadvantage in Brazil and other developing countries. The literature identifies two
primary sources of incumbency disadvantage: voters’ accountability and service provision
(Roberts, 2008; Uppal, 2009), and institutional influences on elections and politician’s incentives (Klašnja and Titiunik, 2017). This paper adds up to this literature by tying the
accountability and service provision literature with investment capacity.
Second, although papers explored the interplay between investment capacity and elections, the micro-foundations and the effects were sparse. Schiumerini (2015) shows that less
financial capacity may decrease the voters’ support, as the state invests less in infrastructure.
We also posit that it affects the politicians’ ability to raise campaign contributions. Boas
et al. (2014) showed that firms donating for a federal deputy aligned with the incumbent
government in Brazil receive on average 14 times the donation in government contracts. In
Brazil, the money spending on campaigns is the main predictor of electoral success (Samuels,
2001b; Speck and Mancuso, 2014). Our work adds up to the relationship between firms and
politicians, showing that the electoral consequences of incumbency depend on the governing
conditions faced by politicians.
Third, our findings explain why Brazilian municipalities in which the mayor is affiliated
10

president receive more transfers for infrastructure provision (Brollo and Nannicini, 2012;
Bueno, 2018). Investment capacity is a powerful strategy to undermine the challengers’
electoral perspectives. Additionally, winning the municipal elections is crucial for success
in the national elections (Novaes, 2018). In the gubernatorial and federal levels, politicians
and parties that understood this relationship attempted to provide the most resources, to
increase the reelection perspective of their candidates.
Finally, in low-income countries, with crippled strength to defer income in order to build
strong financial capability institutions, the electoral results may prove more volatile than otherwise expected. Moreover, patronage and clientelism in developing countries usually make
the investment capacity even worse (Keefer, 2007; Robinson and Verdier, 2013). Rewarding
campaign operatives or voters with monetary perks lowers the local disposable resources for
investing in public services. On extreme cases, this could incentivize politicians not to invest
in public services even in their first term: if all politicians expect to be out of office after
their first term, they will not make costly effort to provide services. In equilibrium, this
should lower the public services received by the population, and increase the expected rent
extraction and corruption by rogue politicians. Moreover, this institutional arrangement
may discourage high-quality politicians, selecting people that want to predate the public
resources, reinforcing the cycle of low-quality policies.

A simple model on elections, government, and investment capacity

Let a strategic interaction between a politician, a firm, and a mass one of voters, that are
responsive only to campaign expenditures.1 .
In line with Klašnja (2015) and inspired by the findings of Klašnja and Titiunik (2017),
we consider that there are two types of politicians: rent-seekers and career concerned.2 The
difference between them is that a career concerned politician wants to invest more in public
services, as she knows that her relationship with voters and firms will span for a longer time
than a rent-seeker politician. The rent-seeker politician prefers not to invest for at least three
reasons. First, she wants to pocket most of the money, and invest in public services is only
attractive when she can add kickbacks to procurement. Second, if invest is costly, she may
prefer to shirk and not spend any resources. Finally, her contact with voters and firms will
shorter than the career politicians, and so, she prefers to makes the most out of her election
regarding rent-seeking opportunities. These types are private information of the individual
politicians.
Firms, on the other hand, look for an opportunity to provide services for the government
as a for-profit enterprise. Firms then contribute to campaigns expecting to be compensated
by the politicians by getting contracts and procurement. If they knew the politician’s types,
they would only contribute to long-term oriented politicians, as these politicians would keep
investing in services, regardless of term limits. However, firms do not know whether the
politician is a rent-seeker or a long-term oriented one.
For the interaction between these two players, we consider a game with the following
sequential time-line:
1. Nature draws the type of the elected incumbent politician from a common-knowledge
distribution.
2. Politicians decide whether to invest or not in public services, hiring or not the firms.
3

The term ends, and the re-election follows.
3. Upon being hired or not, firms then decide whether to donate or not for the incumbents’
re-election contest.
4. If firms donate, then she wins the reelection, else, she retires.
5. Payoffs are realized, and the game ends.
Figure 1 depicts a simplified version of our argument as a simple signaling game.

Figure 1: Extensive-Form Game for the politician-firm strategic interaction
We assume that mayors, upon taking office, have R > 0 resources to invest in public
services. They then decide whether to pocket the investments, or they can proceed and
hire the firms, paying R for its services.3 As the Figure 1 suggest, if the politician does
not invest any resources in public services, the Firm does not donate, and she is out of
office, receiving B, which is the benefit from holding office once, and R, which represents
the pocketed resources.
Upon observing an investment, firms provide the public services, and then, at the following electoral period, they decide again whether they want to donate an amount d > 0 for the
4

incumbent, or not (d = 0). As we are assuming that voters are only responsive for campaign
expenditures, receiving more resources than the challenger would increase the incumbent’s
chances of getting reelected.
The central tension in the model is that firms only want to donate for far-sighted politicians. Firms know that these politicians will hire them regardless of being lame-ducks, as
they want to advance their political career. However, if they donate for short-sighted, they
will not see the public investment in the second turn. This because the short-sighted politicians will pocket the money, and if they invest in the first term, it is just because they expect
to pocket the resources in the second term.
Let q the belief that the Firms hold regarding the firm being far-sighted. The firm will
donate for the incumbent if

E[d, q] = q[2(R − d)] + (1 − q)[R − 2d] ≥ R − d = E(nd, q)
Solving this inequality leads us to the following threshold:

q ≥

d
= q̃
R

q̃ is the cutoff that limits the incentives for donation. If we study a pooling equilibrium,
where both candidates invest in public services, it becomes easier to this equilibrium be
theoretically sustainable, the smaller the q̃. Figure 2 summarizes the incentives.
The model has an equilibrium for pooling strategies, with incumbents always investing
when α ≥ q̃ and never investing when α < q̃. There is no equilibrium in separating strategies.
To summarize our findings we have the following proposition.
Proposition 1. If the the municipal investment capacity increases, then the likelihood of
receiving a donation from the firm also increases.
The proof follows straightforwardly from the q̃ definition. When R increases, q̃ decreases.
The range between [q̃, 1], that depicts the incumbency advantage range, also increases.

Figure 2: Investment Capacity and Donation Thresholds
Corollary 1. If the municipal investment capacity increases, then the chance of getting
reelected increase.
The corollary follows from the fact that increasing the campaign resources also increases
the chance that incumbents will spend more than challengers. This increases their reelection
prospective when the electorate is impressionable.
Note that this simple model can be extended to add randomness in the investment
capacity, or in the voter’s utility. In the first case, we could make R a random draw from a
continuous distribution, with finite support. The strategy from the politicians’ perspective
would be to invest R when the politician is career concerned. When the politician is rentseeker, she invests a fraction of R, enough to make the firm indifferent between donating
or not. The optimal donation strategy would be to donate with an increasing probability,
6

conditional on the amount of resources received.
From the voter’s perspective, we could add public service provision concern or ideological
voting. In the first case, the adverse electoral effects of investment capacity would come from
two places: the campaign investments and the low service provision. Adding ideology would
not change things substantially, as politicians would set their ideal policies at the median.
Both extensions are available upon request.

A description of the budget process in Brazilian municipalities

The Brazilian federalism is commonly defined as a centripetal political union arrange (Arretche, 2010; Beramendi, 2012). First, municipalities are required by law to implement public
policies in areas such as health and education according to the federal government specific
guidelines. Second, most of the local level taxes are collected by the federal government and
then redistributed among states and municipalities. Third, municipalities have low discretion
to create taxes and contributions.
The decision on the allocation of the budget at the local level is composed of two steps.
First, the executive branch defines the priorities based on the municipalities needs and the
resources available. Second, politicians in the city council vote the executive budget spending
proposal. Since the government coalitions with majorities is a hallmark of the Brazilian local
politics (Santos, 2013), it is implausible that the final budget proposal does not reflect the
executive branch preferences. However, the investment capacity of municipalities is limited.
The Brazilian municipalities heavily depend on federal government transfers due to their
low fiscal capacity. For instance, in 2015, 92% of municipalities have more than 70% of their
budget composed by federal transfers4 . To mitigate the problem of low investment capacity
of municipalities, the Brazilian Congress created a rule to limited municipalities spending.
The law of fiscal responsibility (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal), implemented in 2000, sets
maximum limits (54%) on public budget levels for personnel payrolls, which creates incentives
to mayors prioritize investments in infrastructure provision. However, municipalities still
facing challenges to fulfill this expectation. In 2015, on average, municipalities spent only
9% of their budget with infrastructure provision. By contrast, they spent 54% of their budget
with personnel payrolls5 .

Table 2: Descriptive Statistics
As we can see, most of the variables have the entire dataset with valid observations,
besides the campaign resources. Campaign resources has more missing values because the
candidate has to have received campaign donations in order to have some values to present.
This variable is considerably post-treatment and is not used in our paper.

Moreover, Table 3 shows the summary statistics on the donation by the electoral status
for three different bandwidth selection.

Identification Strategy

Electoral results depend heavily on the efforts and resources employed by the candidates.
However, candidates are unable to manipulate the vote share they will receive precisely.
Elections decided by a small vote margin have a strongly random component, and in some
of those elections, it was ex-ante unpredictable who would win the contest. Therefore,
candidates that lose by a small vote margin serve as a suitable account for those candidates
who were elected by a small margin of votes (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008).
From 2000 to 2012, the RD running variable is the vote margin difference between the
two most voted candidates. The differences between the electoral winners and immediate
losers in consecutive terms, compared with the candidates that lost and then won or viceversa, raises problems concerning the endogeneity of the reelection running decision (Song,
2018). Magalhães (2015) addresses this selection problem proposing an outcome variable that
takes value one (1) if the candidate reruns and wins in the next election, but takes value
zero (0) if the candidate loses or drops the race. With this strategy, we can measure the
outcome effects even when rerunning is not widespread and the RD estimates the incumbency
effect on the probability of winning the next election, unconditional on rerunning. We
estimate the incumbency effect on the probability of receiving campaign finance resources
from firms unconditional to the fact that the candidate is rerunning in the next election.
To account for the fiscal capacity, we split the sample in the median, to measure whether
municipalities with more fiscal capacity have better outcomes regarding firms’ donation
and incumbency effects. We should interpret these results as heterogeneous effects in the
donation-incumbency disadvantage estimates.
The regression discontinuity design uses the arbitrary change vote share, with a sharp
discontinuity when is positive versus negative, meaning that the candidate wins or lose,
to estimate the causal effect. We use a local-linear polynomial estimate with a triangular
kernel distance to the cutoff weighting (putting more weight to cases closer to the cutoff) and
computing the optimal bandwidth using the Calonico et al. (2014) MSE-robust data-driven
13

optimal bandwidth.6
The validity of our causal claim requires the empirical strategy to satisfy two assumptions:
no endogenous manipulations, such as frauds, and the pre-treatment variables continuity. We
show below that there are no sign of manipulations and all the pre-treatment variables such
as the candidates’ gender, age, profession, and party labels, were not statistically significant.
These results reinforce that our empirical strategy is solid.

Robustness to placebo cutoffs

Consider the proportion of votes acquired by both politicians. The difference in this proportion represents the running variable. The politician with proportion of votes bigger than
zero won the election while the politician with negative difference lost.
A placebo test, to check the validity of our results, would consider a different (and false)
winning threshold. For instance, we can change the cutoff from zero to any number we want,
and investigate what happens in this new cut. Theoretically, we should have null results in
all the placebo cutoffs, as a positive or negative sign in these cutoffs does not change the
electoral status from winning or loser.
We rerun the analysis changing the cutoff from zero (the actual cutoff) for placebo cutoffs
at -10, -5, 5, and 10. The results are in the Figures below, and they are consistent with our
assumption that most results would be, either not significant, or not consistent with our
theory.

Heterogeneous effects by deciles of investment capacity

We run the heterogeneous effects by decile. Deciles weaken the test power considerably, but
we should witness the main patterns in the coefficients. For Inverse Personnel Expenditure,
we see a pattern ranges from negative and significant to negative but insignificant, to positive
in the last decile of incumbency disadvantage. Something similar occurs in donations from
firms.
For the Firjan Liquidity Index, an intriguing findings is that between the 30 and the 50
percentiles, the incumbency disadvantage and donation indicators are negative, flipping sign
between 50 and 70 percentiles (all insignificant). This suggests that when a municipality
is in a very good or very bad shape, the investment capacity carries very little additional
information. However, when it is around the median, the information discrepancies may
provide an information advantage for the mayoral candidate. The candidate then can use
the uncertainty in her favor.

Party-centered alternative explanations

Klašnja and Titiunik (2017) present a view on the incumbency disadvantage, proposing that
strong parties (as PT in Brazil), are able to credibly signal to the electorate that they will
provide services as lame-ducks. In the model we presented in Appendix A, this represents
that PT would be able to select (or at least constrain politicians to be) long term oriented
politicians. In the regressions below we show that our results are complementary to Klašnja
and Titiunik (2017), as their main conclusion about PT also holds in our sample. We
run the main regressions for PT and PSDB (the most important programmatic parties in
Brazil), PMDB (the most important centrist party in Brazil), and then considering changes
in the opposition and coalition status of mayors and challengers in Brazilian towns. The
results follow below, and show that a party-centered view of Brazilian politics coexist with
a investment capacity centered one.
