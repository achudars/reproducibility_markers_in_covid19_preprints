Closing the Gateway: Street Closures, Bisected Geography, and Crime in St. Louis, MO
Abstract

Where intersections would typically be open to two-way traffic, in hundreds in cases in St.
Louis, Missouri, they have been closed using concrete barriers or cul-de-sacs. In this paper, we
provide the most comprehensive data set of closures available, evaluate their location in the city,
and assess their association with contemporary violent crime patterns. We find that though City
legislation describes the barriers as crime reduction tools, they are associated with elevated
violent crime rates at the neighborhood-level today. This finding suggests significant limitations
with “defensible space” strategies in St. Louis and elsewhere for addressing crime.

Traversing any city can be a challenge for visitors and locals alike - one-way
streets, limits placed on making turns at particular intersections, and poor signage can
stymie even seasoned navigators. In St. Louis, it can be even more challenging still.
Spread throughout neighborhoods in the city’s midsection and in what locals call “North
City” are concrete barricades that prevent traffic flow in one or both directions through
certain intersections. They have been the subject of local fascination for decades. The
City first installed many barriers in the mid-1970s under the administration of Mayor
Vincent Schoemehl. Locals now refer to the barriers in some areas as “Schoemehl pots”
(Thorsen, 2015; see Figure 1), paying homage to the man who helped create what one
local website called a “city body at war with itself” (Allen, 2014).
<<<FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE>>>
“Defensible space” theory (Allen 2014) fits with the closures’ manifest function as a
crime prevention tool. Indeed, in recent legislation authorizing new closures, the Board
of Aldermen bills typically note that closing a street will increase the surrounding
neighborhood’s safety. Though the Board of Aldermen authorizes new barriers through
legislation, the City does not retain a systematic list of closures made by public works
employees (Thorsen, 2015). Thus, systematically tracing the installations has been
difficult for local reporters and writers interested in the phenomenon.
We, therefore, have two aims with this paper. First, we provide the most specific
accounting to date of how St. Louis’s urban geography has become a tangled web of
closed streets. We have published a dataset of all known current and former closures
3

within the city alongside this paper. Second, we offer two sets of statistical analyses that
empirically evaluate the demographic characteristics associated with barrier density
within neighborhoods and test the relationship between violent crime rates for St. Louis
in 2016 and barrier density at the neighborhood level.
The relationship between barrier density and crime is most important because it
speaks to one of the two core justifications for the street closures’ very existence; the
other is traffic control. We find that increased barrier density in neighborhoods is
associated with higher numbers of violent crimes. This finding suggests that, whatever
the past successes barriers may have had in addressing violent crime, they do not appear
to be associated with lower crime rates today. We know of no other city that has
implemented barriers in the numbers seen in St. Louis. Therefore, this finding speaks to
the tenability of defensible space strategies more generally as a means for addressing
violent crime. As we will outline, this paper revisits the notion of defensible space in the
very place where the concept originated.

Background

Defensible Space Theory
St. Louis has the unique distinction of being not just the site of a large-scale
implementation of Oscar Newman’s ideas about defensible space but also as the
birthplace of these ideas themselves. The proliferation of street closures in St. Louis is
the product of a marriage between a city’s declining demographic trajectory and a
4

theory about how to create greater control of public space for residents. Oscar Newman
is well known for his theory of “defensible space” and his involvement in Yonkers’
housing desegregation court case. He began his career as an academic in St. Louis during
the mid-1960s, teaching architecture at Washington University. He placed the origin of
defensible space in St. Louis, noting that the idea of defensible space arose from the
City’s Pruitt-Igoe public housing project’s demise. Newman also developed his
suggestion of street closures as an anti-crime tactic in St. Louis based on his
observations of private streets that had been closed by residents to thru traffic
(Newman, 1996).
Following Newman (1972, 1996), we understand the intended function of street
barriers and road closures as a means of increasing control over behavior within
residential spaces. Delineating between private and public areas of cities is a core aspect
of Newman’s broader theory of defensible space. In seeking a clear distinction between
public and private space for both inhabitants of a neighborhood and outsiders, Newman
hopes to instill a home-grown sense of ownership and control for residents. As we have
already noted, this need to control public space is a byproduct of an oft-repeated
narrative about the infamous Pruitt-Igoe public housing complex. Looking at PruittIgoe, Newman argued that:
“Because all the grounds were common and disassociated
from the units, residents could not identify with them. The
areas proved unsafe. The river of trees soon became a sewer
of glass and garbage. The mailboxes on the ground floor were
vandalized. The corridors, lobbies, elevators, and stairs were
5

dangerous places to walk. They became covered with graffiti
and littered with garbage and human waste. The elevators,
laundry, and community rooms were vandalized, and
garbage was stacked high around the choked garbage
chutes.” (Newman, 1996, p. 10)

Newman argues that changes to the built environment can increase the space’s
territoriality—strengthening the sense of ownership residents have over their
communities. He posits that these changes help residents better position themselves to
be aware of and act against crime within their neighborhoods (Newman, 1972).
Newman does not stop at advocating for changes within the design of public
housing. Creating “controlled enclaves” (Newman, 1996, p. 13) is another way to
introduce a sense of ownership over public space within a neighborhood. Writing
specifically about street closures, Newman argues that:
“One of the benefits of street closure and the creation of
mini-neighborhoods is that it brings neighbors together in
unified action to address their joint problems. It also focuses
their attention on removing criminal activity from their
communities.” (Newman, 1996, p. 52)

He thus ties street closures directly to the management of public (or heretofore public)
space and crime reduction, connections he made in initial research based on private
streets in St. Louis (Newman, 1980; Newman et al., 1974).
Newman was not the only person to make these types of arguments in the 1970s.
Criminologist C. Ray Jeffery also calls upon design disciplines to mitigate criminal
activity through physical changes to space. With his intervention of Crime Prevention
6

Through Environmental Design (CPTED), Jeffery (1971) suggests that crime occurs
when presented with an opportunity. By limiting these opportunities, neighborhoods are
less likely to become targets of criminal activity. Therefore, defensible space and
CPTED aim to fortify the built environment and increase natural surveillance
opportunities—drawing inspiration from Jane Jacob’s idea of eyes on the street (Jacobs,
1961).
Principles of Defensible Space and CPTED have increased in popularity since
emerging in the 1970s. By the mid-1990s, the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development heralded these methods as effective measures in small public
housing sites, even commissioning Newman to compile case studies to demonstrate their
efficacy (Cisneros, 1996; Newman, 1996). During this period, neighborhoods began to
feature iron gates, dead-end streets, and flower-beds as both real and symbolic barriers
separating their communities from others.
Despite the propagation of defensible space as a design strategy, the efficacy of
‘designing out crime’ remains contested. Studies suggest that while these crime
prevention initiatives may impede crime within one community, crime continues—
merely displaced to an adjacent space (Gabor, 1981; Reppetto, 1976). Furthermore, due
to their reliance on residents to come together to reduce crime, defensible space features
have proven less effective in spaces where individuals have not developed a sense of
belonging or established significant connections to other residents (Merry, 1981).

7

Individuals are less inclined to protect communities of which they do not believe they
are a member.
Wagner (1997) highlights the complexities of designing out crime in St. Louis,
which sought to understand the implications of traffic pattern modifications in two
adjacent neighborhoods. Wagner studied the effects of changes to traffic flow undertaken
through an initiative called “Project Quiet Street.” This effort blocked access to some
streets running through the area identified in the study as ‘West Neighborhood.’ By
comparing West Neighborhood with adjacent ‘East Neighborhood,’ which had similar
demographics but did not participate in the program, Wagner found that reducing
traffic flow in West Neighborhood may have been associated with decreasing burglary
rates in the five years after the street modifications, though a causal argument cannot
be made here. He likewise found that residents reported experiencing less fear of crime
in their neighborhood.
Other studies examining defensible space suggest that personal familiarity with
neighborhoods may pose a challenge for defensible space interventions. While changes to
the built environment may help separate public and private spaces, individuals who
identify themselves as a part of the community or frequent the area and wish to commit
a crime may not be deterred (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1993; Cohen & Felson,
1979). Others (Atlas, 1991; Mawby, 1977) go further, arguing that defensible space and
CPTED features may work to create offensive space for individuals committing illicit
acts. Here, individuals still develop a sense of ownership of their neighborhood but use
8

the defensible built environment for surveillance to work against other community
residents.

St. Louis
One possible explanation for the mixed track record of defensible space could lie in St.
Louis itself. Defensible space seeks to address what Newman (1996) and others (Blake,
1977; Jencks, 1977) see as the monumental failure of design in Pruitt-Igoe. However, a
counter-narrative suggests that the demise of Pruitt-Igoe was not ultimately a failure of
design but the predictable outcome of structural inequality. St. Louis has been a
laboratory for housing segregation and white flight. Both ultimately contributed to
significant population loss (by 2017, the city’s population was just 36% of its high in
1950), resulting in a limited municipal budget that has made maintaining public housing
difficult (Gordon, 2009; Tighe & Ganning, 2015). These dynamics, combined with a lack
of sufficient federal funds for maintenance, it can be argued, all but ensured the demise
of not just Pruitt-Igoe but the Robert Taylor Homes, Cabrini Green, and others
(Bristol, 1991; Heathcott, 2012). They also help us understand rising crime patterns
over the same period (see Figure 2). This narrative suggests that defensible space may
have an inconclusive track record because the design itself is not the core issue. Instead,
the social structures within which that design becomes realized has a far more
significant effect on social patterns within the city.
<<<FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE>>>
9

Nevertheless, the idea that Pruitt Igoe’s design was to blame rapidly took hold
(Bailey, 1965; Blake, 1977; Jencks, 1977) thus generating demand for Newman’s ideas.
In the shadow of Pruitt-Igoe’s final destruction at the hands of dynamite and the
wrecking ball, 1970s St. Louis became not just the inspiration for Newman’s work but
the site of early, vigorous implementation of these ideas. From 1977 through the early
1990s (and sporadically after that), St. Louis has erected at least 335 barriers, closing
streets to through traffic to “enhance and increase the stability of the neighborhood
adjacent to said street” (St. Louis City Ordinance 62459).
The City made these installations in response to what Newman described as a
city tearing itself asunder:
“St. Louis in the mid-1960s was a city coming apart...It had
one of the Nation’s highest crime rates, but the private
streets appeared to be oblivious to the chaos and abandonment taking place around them.” (Newman, 1996, p. 13)

City planning documents from the early 1970s note both of these trends. The 1973 St.
Louis Development Program lays out in stark terms the dramatic population loss many
cities were experiencing, including growing rates of vacancy, tax delinquency, and
violent crime. Critically, the report also notes:
“There are many streets whose primary purpose is not to
carry through traffic. Their function is to serve residential
neighborhoods safely. In recent years...there has been a
growing tendency for extraneous traffic to usurp these local
streets… [and this] has contributed to the debilitation of
many residential neighborhoods. Consequently, new methods

10

must be found to correct this unsatisfactory traffic condition”
(City of St. Louis, 1973, p. 76).

Within approximately a year of the initial publication of Oscar Newman’s (1972) work
about St. Louis, there was a deliberate expression of the need to close residential
neighborhoods to traffic by the City of St. Louis. This plan endorsed closures as both
crime prevention and traffic control strategies (see Wagner, 1997). The City’s plan was
followed by a second Newman publication, explicitly discussing the use of road closures
a short time later (Newman et al., 1974).
Notably, the City has not maintained a master list of these closures (Thorsen,
2015). Therefore, our first aim is descriptive — to understand the geography of street
closures in St. Louis. Our second objective is analytical and has two facets. We seek to
understand the demographic factors associated with barrier installations and discern
whether barriers are associated with violent crimes in the communities where they exist.
We hypothesize that if street barriers are a successful policy tool for designing out
crime, there should be a negative relationship between the number of barriers in a
neighborhood and the number of violent crimes.

Data and Methods

Data Sources
Our data set is the product of four individual data sources. To locate street
barriers, we identified an initial list of street barriers from a Washington University in
11

St. Louis term paper that examined the barriers phenomenon (Waldron, 2010).1 From
this list, we used the City’s orthoimagery, Google Street View, and fieldwork visits to
identify which barriers are still in place. Each barrier noted in the term paper was
verified using various means, and we added new barriers identified during our checks to
form a single list of known barriers. Checking against these additional sources resulted
in a publicly available data set of point data describing the locations of barriers2 known
to remain in existence as of 2017 (n=280) as well as those that were removed by the
City at some past date (n=55).
In addition to these barriers data, we utilize data from several other sources. We
obtained publicly available address-level crime data from the St. Louis Police
Department. Our measure of storefront businesses, which have a relationship with
crimes in some analyses (Bernasco & Block, 2011), utilize the City Observatory’s Store
Front Index database. Finally, we sourced census tract-level demographic data from the
1950 and 1980 decennial censuses, as well as the 2016 American Community Survey 5year estimates. The decennial census data were used to construct explanatory variables
for modeling demographic correlates of barriers in 1980, while the ACS data were used
to construct control variables for modeling the relationship between barriers and violent
crimes in 2016.
Census tracts can be a problematic unit of analysis because they are not stable
throughout time, often being redrawn from census to census. To achieve a stable unit of
analysis throughout time, we used the R package areal (C. Prener & Revord, 2019) to
12

interpolate tract-level data into one-square kilometer grid squares. This process utilized
grid square-level data based on the census tracts that intersected with each grid square
and the size of those intersections. The creation of the grid “fishnet” yielded a dataset
with 205 grid squares with corresponding demographic attributes for 1980 and 206 grid
squares for our remaining variables. This analytical data set is also available for public
download as part of this manuscript’s Open Science Framework repository.3

Methods
We conducted our initial descriptive analysis by mapping the point data for
barrier locations using ArcGIS Desktop kernel density techniques. To address our second
aim, we conducted our regression analyses in R (R Core Team, 2020). While spatial
models for continuous variables are well established in the literature (see Anselin & Rey,
2014), models for count data (including Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated
models) remain an ongoing development area. One technique to account for spatial
autocorrelation in count models is “eigenvector filtering” (Helbich & Jokar Arsanjani,
2015). This approach uses a global spatial weights matrix to develop one or more
eigenvectors representing spatial relationships. These become independent variables in
subsequent models. This modeling strategy utilizes the R packages MASS (Venables &
Ripley, 2002), pscl (Jackman, 2020; Zeileis et al., 2008), spatialreg (R. S. Bivand et al.,
2013), and spdep (R. Bivand & Wong, 2018).

13

For these analyses, our two dependent variables were street barriers per grid
square and violent crimes in 2016 per grid square. Because each variable was already
spatially normalized because of their uniform size across each areal unit (except grid
squares on the city’s edges, which are smaller than a full square kilometer grid square
and vary in size), we opted to preserve each dependent variable in count form rather
than convert them into rates. The first set of models evaluate the relationship between
barrier counts and demographic factors from 1980 when barrier installations began in
earnest. Our second set of models evaluates the contemporary relationship as of 2016
between barriers and violent crime. We include descriptive statistics for all variables in
Table 1.
<<<TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE>>>
Due to the racialized development history of St. Louis, in which African
American residents have been particularly marginalized (Gordon, 2009; Tighe &
Ganning, 2015), we included the proportion of African American residents in each grid
square as a predictor. We reason that perceptions of racial threat (e.g., Eitle et al., 2002;
Parker et al., 2005), in addition to the persistent marginalization of African American
neighborhoods throughout the history of St. Louis (Johnson, 2020), has made grid
squares with significant proportions of African American residents the target of more
barrier installations as well as more crime.

Results

Spatial Distribution of Barriers and Violent Crimes
Both street barriers and violent crime occur unevenly in St. Louis. Though the
mean street barrier count per grid square is 1.37, the standard deviation is more than
double it at 2.77. The kernel density map shown in Figure 3 provides visual specificity,
showing dense concentrations of barriers in areas proximate to both sides of Delmar
Boulevard. In contrast, barrier distribution in the northernmost and southeastern parts
of the city are far more sparse. Figure 4 shows the distribution of street barriers and
violent crimes across grid squares, which tells a similar story—the grid squares with the
highest concentration of obstacles either straddle or are proximate to Delmar Boulevard.
The mean number of violent crimes per grid square is 28.07, but a standard deviation of
33.28 shows a similarly high level of variability. Figure 4 shows an overwhelming
concentration of violent crime in North City and pockets of the city’s southwestern
portion. Large swaths of the southeastern part of the city are devoid of barriers and
have relatively low amounts of violent crime.
<<<FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE>>>
<<<FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE>>>

Historic Neighborhood Factors and Barrier Locations
Though the City began installing barriers in the late 1970s, our analysis of
barrier data indicates the 1980s were when most installations occurred. Using
demographic data from the 1980 Decennial Census to understand the current geography
15

of barriers present allows us to model factors associated with barrier density. Our
modeling strategy for barriers relies on count models. We evaluated both Poisson and
negative binomial models and selected negative binomial regression because of
overdispersion in Model 1 (see Table 2).4 In addition to compensating for overdispersion,
Models 2 and 3 also provide a better fit for our data as evidenced by decreasing AIC
and BIC values. Model 3 uses the “eigenvector filtering” technique to account for spatial
autocorrelation’s effect on Module 2’s coefficients. The Moran’s I values presented in
Table 2 suggest that the eigenvectors removed some autocorrelation, though it remains
to a degree in Model 3. Our interpretations will, therefore, focus on Model 3.
<<<TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE>>>
Of the factors included in these models, both population and vacancy are
statistically significant predictors associated with the number of barriers in each grid
square. A unit change in scaled population is associated with a 2.951 increase in the
incident rate ratio (IRR) for barriers (p < .001). Likewise, a one-point increase in scaled
vacancy is associated with a 2.329 increase in the IRR for barriers (p < .001). Increasing
population density, since the grid squares represent square kilometers, and increasing
proportion of vacant units are associated with increases in the number of barriers in a
given square. Notable, poverty, the racial composition of grid squares, and population
change were not associated with the number of barriers.

Street Barriers and Contemporary Neighborhood Conditions
16

Since the 1980 decennial census, population loss has continued to shape St.
Louis’s demographic trajectory. Given that installations mainly took place in the 1970s,
it does not make temporal sense to model the relationship between barriers and
contemporary demographics in a multivariate manner. Correlation coefficients,
presented in Table 3, give a sense of how different demographic characteristics are
related to barrier counts in each grid square.
<<<TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE>>>
When we compare current demographic factors and barriers per grid square,
population loss since 1950 stands out for its albeit weak relationship (r = -0.271, p <
0.001) with barriers. By 2016, nearly every neighborhood in St. Louis had experienced at
least some degree of population loss. This pattern is a departure from Model 3 in the
prior section, which showed no significant relationship between population loss and
barriers’ original locations.
Beyond population loss, few demographic factors show associations with barrier
counts per grid square. This lack of relationships is unsurprising given the geographic
extent of barriers—they cut across a swath of majority African American, somewhat
integrated, and majority-white neighborhoods. There is also a wide variance in the
amount of vacancy and poverty in these neighborhoods, so the lack of significance is
again unsurprising. That said, there is a weak negative relationship between owneroccupied housing and barriers (r = -0.162, p < .05), with fewer owner-occupied units
associated with higher counts of barriers.
17

The Relationship Between Barriers and Violent Crime
While there may not be strong associations between current demographic
conditions and barriers in St. Louis, that does not mean that barriers do not have
contemporary relevance in the city. The number of streets that remain closed several
decades after the widespread adoption of barriers as a strategy for addressing, at least
in-part, violent crime means that the barriers may still influence that issue. Indeed, we
believe that the city’s violent crime rates (Smith & Sandoval, 2019) form one
contemporary reason for maintaining the closures. Understanding the relationship
between barriers and violent crime represents both a test of defensible space as a
theoretical concept and a practical policy question for St. Louis City officials.
As we discussed above, violent crimes themselves (much like barriers) do not
occur evenly across the City of St. Louis. They follow a Poisson distribution at the gridsquare level - many grid squares have minimal violent crime while a few have large
numbers of incidents each year. To understand the relationship between barriers and
violent crime, we, therefore, pursue a modeling strategy to deal with both the
distribution of violent crime counts and the presence of spatial autocorrelation by using
both Poisson and negative binomial models. As with our prior models, we use
eigenvector filtering as a means to address autocorrelation. Table 4 presents our
Poisson, negative binomial, and negative binomial with eigenvector filtering models.
Overall, the negative binomial models provide a substantially better fit for these data
18

than a standard Poisson model. Accounting for spatial autocorrelation provides some
further improvement on model fit, as evidenced by decreasing AIC and BIC values as
well as a smaller Morgan’s I value. Given these metrics, Model 6 will be the focus of our
description here.
<<<TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE>>>
Our main effect, the relationship between the number of street barriers and the
number of violent crimes in a given grid square, holds across all three models in Table 4.
Model 6, which includes a correction for spatial autocorrelation, shows a positive
relationship between the number of barriers and violent crimes (IRR = 1.163, p =
0.030). This relationship holds while accounting for other factors, including population,
commercial properties, vacancy, and the grid square’s estimated demographic makeup.
As the number of barriers increases, so does the count of violent crimes after accounting
for other factors. This pattern suggests that barriers do not fulfill their manifest function
of eliminating crime. Instead, higher barrier density is associated with higher numbers of
violent crimes. However, this pattern does not suggest that the barriers themselves cause
violent crime, a point we return to in the discussion.
Several other factors are associated with violent crime as well, including the
proportion of African American neighborhoods in St. Louis (IRR = 1.778, p < .001).
Others have noted similar patterns both in St. Louis (Smith & Sandoval, 2019), and
these findings speak to the burden that violent crime places on particular communities.
As with the placement of barriers themselves, this finding suggests that structural forces
19

associated with violent crime have a disproportionate effect on historically marginalized
communities in St. Louis. Those structural forces include population loss, which
decreases violent crime (IRR = 0.721, p < .001). It is not the grid squares most beset by
population loss that experience violent crime, then, but rather squares with more
minimal population loss since nearly every square in St. Louis has seen some degree of
population loss since 1950.
Our models also find that storefront businesses are associated with higher violent
crime levels (IRR = 1.342, p < .001). This pattern matches other findings on the effect
of businesses on where crime occurs (Bernasco & Block, 2011). Population counts itself
(IRR = 2.689, p < .001) are also a predictor of increased amounts of violent crime. In
both cases, increasing residents and businesses are associated with an increased
likelihood of violent crime. Notably, however, these factors do not explain away the
relationship between street barriers and violent crime.

Discussion

As we noted previously, our goal with these analyses is two-fold: we seek first to
describe where the City of St. Louis installed barriers and to examine the relationship
between barriers and violent crime. We find that the City heavily concentrated barrier
installations in a relatively narrow area of St. Louis along Delmar Boulevard. Delmar
Boulevard is a widely recognized line of demarcation in many St. Louis residents’
geographic imagination. The ‘Delmar Divide’ thus represents the spatial segregation of
20

North City, which is predominantly African American, from the integrated communities
of the central corridor and the predominantly white communities of South St. Louis.
Analytically, we also aim to understand the relationship between neighborhood
demographic factors and barrier density. We find that both population counts and
vacancy proportions in 1980 were associated with grid squares’ barrier counts.
Our other analytical goal is to understand the degree to which barrier density
affects violent crime within neighborhoods. Following the longstanding aim of the
barriers articulated in policy documents and the local media, our hypothesis anticipated
a negative relationship between violent crime and barrier density at the neighborhood
level. Counter to this hypothesis, we find evidence that not only are barriers not factors
in decreasing crime, but they are associated positively with violent crime rates holding
other factors related to crime rates constant.
Critically, there may be no causal relationship between barriers and crime. In this
narrative, closures happen to be located in neighborhoods with higher crime rates and
are merely ineffective at limiting crime within these spaces. However, such an argument
would contradict their reason for existing as expressed in the City’s Board of Alderman
bills that have authorized recent closures. Whether barriers are, at worst, associated
with higher crime rates or, at best, ineffective, they present a contradictory face—their
official reason for existence as a crime prevention tactic does not hold with
contemporary crime patterns, yet they remain entrenched throughout the city.

21

St. Louis’s street closures’ persistence in this light is intriguing and an avenue for
future work. It is likely that residents remain mostly unaware of their effectiveness (or
lack thereof). It is also possible that the barriers’ creation of cul-de-sacs appeals to
residents for traffic safety reasons or because they desire the feel of a more suburban
neighborhood. Both would provide strong public motivations for retaining the barriers
despite their lack of impact on violent crime.
Nevertheless, we believe that our findings raise important questions for City
officials. While there may be second-order benefits for residents who live on closed
blocks, it is also possible to have second-order negative consequences. The City of St.
Louis’s Fire Chief, for example, explicitly condemned the closures in 2009 after a
shooting on a closed street: “This has been an ongoing concern of the fire department’s.
We don’t like [the barriers]. They severely impede what we do” (Allen, 2014). In light of
our findings, City officials would do well to question whether the possible unintended
consequences of delayed first responders are worth the continuation of these closures.
City officials should also consider what other unintended consequences of closures
might exist, including inefficient public transit and school bus routes, the viability of
businesses within neighborhoods with higher densities of closures, and the capital costs
associated with maintaining and upgrading barriers over time. Given the significant
challenges facing St. Louis, including segregation, crime, vacancy, and population loss
(Gordon, 2009; C. G. Prener et al., 2018; Sandoval, 2013; Tighe & Ganning, 2015), we
wonder if more active crime prevention strategies might be more effective. These should
22

include those interventions that address deep-seated social issues that deserve priority
over the cost of maintaining these street closures.
Beyond the City of St. Louis, our findings suggest that cities should implement
defensible space strategies like street closures with caution. They are in line with other
analyses (Gabor, 1981; Reppetto, 1976) that question the efficacy of defensible space as
a method for controlling crime. These data also provide a telling example of how even
well-meaning interventions to reduce crime may not “design out” crime if they do not
deal with more fundamental factors that drive violence in cities.

Limitations
One important caveat for our analyses is that we did not have address-level crime
data when the most significant number of barriers were installed (from 1977 through the
early 1990s). Thus, we cannot measure the degree to which the barriers themselves
worked or did not work early in their existence. The overall trend in crime (see Figure
1) did continue, mostly unabated, after the barrier installations began. A second
essential and related caveat is that we do not measure the hyper-local effects of barriers.
It is possible that, while there is a positive relationship between barrier density and
crime rates at the neighborhood level, closed blocks themselves experience less crime
than neighboring blocks that remain open. This second caveat is the direction we intend
to take in future research. A third caveat has to do with the spatial maldistribution of
both population and violent crime in St. Louis, which leads to high standard deviations
23

for both measures. These variations are an essential feature of our data that shapes our
final results.
A fourth and final source of error lies within our demographic data. The
American Community Survey’s (ACS) five-year estimates are subject to a degree of
error. This error can be compounded by the simultaneous aggregation and
disaggregation of count data through the areal interpolation process. While we have
tools to express the margin of error within the ACS, we lack similar ways to express the
uncertainty of estimates created using areal weighted interpolation. This unquantified
error is also an important source of limitation for our results.

Conclusion

Oscar Newman’s defensible space theory is a product of St. Louis’s mid-century
history. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that St. Louis also offers a large-scale
implementation of defensible space in the street barriers that constrict swaths of the
city’s geography. The barriers scattered across the city’s landscape are a testament not
only to former Mayor Vincent Schoemehl, the elected official most closely associated
with the barriers, but to Newman himself. We have developed the most comprehensive
known list of closures in the city, and find that the density of closures is not associated
with less crime in neighborhoods. Our finding is an important one for St. Louis, given
that addressing crime is the argument being made explicitly in the legislation that
authorizes more recent installations of barriers. For other municipalities that may be
24

considering defensible space or other techniques to “design out” crime, our findings
suggest that street closures are at best ineffective and at worst associated with higher
rates of violent crime in neighborhoods. They may also have secondary effects on first
responders’ ability to reach the neighborhoods they serve.

Notes
1

While perhaps unorthodox, the lack of a master list from the City of St. Louis

necessitated this as a starting point. All barriers recorded from the original Waldron list
were checked extensively to ensure that they corresponded to correct locations.

It is worth noting that a substantial number of grid squares include no barriers at all,

and we also evaluated zero-inflated models for their suitability. Comparisons using a
Vuong test suggested that the zero-inflated models were not a substantial improvement
on the negative binomial models.
