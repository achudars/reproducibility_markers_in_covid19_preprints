Abstract
This study looks at factors influencing pre-service teachers’ use of experiments in the
classroom. The study is a panel survey of high school -level biology and chemistry pre-service
teachers in Rhineland Palatinate, Germany from 2013-2017. The study applies the Theory of
Planned Behaviour and looks at attitudes, norms, behavioural control, and intentions as the main
explanatory variables. The analyses show that attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural
controls play important roles in determining the use of experiments. For biology teachers,
attitudes are the strongest predictors of the use of experiments. For chemistry teachers,
behavioural control is the strongest predictor.
Keywords: natural science teaching, behaviour, theory of planned behaviour,
experiments, inquiry-based teaching
Funding: This work was supported by the Ministry of Education and Ministry of
Science, Further Education and Culture, Federal State of Rhineland Palatinate (formerly
Ministry of Education, Science, Further Education and Culture).

1. Introduction2
Lessons in natural science education follow the goals of conveying a) subject knowledge, b) the
principles of scientific inquiry (the ‘nature of science’) and/or c) scientific methods
(Bruckermann, Arnold, Kremer & Schlüter, 2017). Inquiry-based teaching encompasses the
concept of allowing pupils to participate practically in lessons, allowing them to discover
relations and causal effects on their own. Inquiry-based teaching gives pupils the chance to learn
about scientific methods first-hand while principles of scientific inquiry and subject knowledge
are conveyed more indirectly. Inquiry-based teaching is thereby seen as a way to combine all

three goals (Millar, 2004). As such, it has become an influential concept in educational science
and didactics. Indeed, most would agree inquiry-based teaching and a more active involvement
of the pupils is generally preferable to rattling-off subject knowledge for the pupils to memorize.
Recent reforms of German teachers’ education programs have placed on increased importance
on didactics and educational sciences with the goal of producing teachers that are not just well
versed in the subject knowledge, but who are also able to more effectively convey the material
to the pupils (Sedlmeier, Jänchen, Rauh, Langer & Partschefeld, 2010).
So, there are strong arguments to be made for the use of more inquiry-based styles of teaching
and this line of reasoning has informed concrete political steps in the development of German
teachers’ education programs. If it can be said then that, from a normative perspective, teachers
should incorporate more inquiry-based teaching into their lessons, then the task remains to
convince them to actually do so. Reform steps at the system level can create more favourable
conditions but ultimately teachers’ behaviour cannot be deterministically changed from the
topdown.
This study attempts to explain teachers’ behaviour with regards to inquiry-based teaching
methods using the example of experiments in the natural science classroom. In the natural
sciences, the experiment is an obvious example of an inquiry-based teaching approach. By
mixing chemicals or observing plant growth in an experimental design, pupils gain an
understanding of scientific methods and devices as the subject-matter and the general principles
of scientific inquiry are conveyed. Using the TPB (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010), currently one of
the most prominent theoretical frameworks in social sciences, we look specifically at attitudes,
norms, behavioural control and their underlying beliefs to explain, on an individual-level, why
teachers decide to experiment in their lessons.
The analysis is quasi-experimental in comparing pre-service teachers of the former “state
exam”-system to those of the new bachelor- and master-programs that have an increased focus

on didactics and education sciences. We sample pre-service biology and chemistry teachers in
Rhineland-Palatinate in the second, practical phase of their teachers’ education programs. In
doing so, we observe future teachers in their ‘blank slate’ form, before any of them have had
the chance to gain practical experience (besides short internships) as a teacher. We thus attempt
to isolate the effect of teachers’ education university programs. Our study provides explanations
for teachers’ behaviour and helps generate recommendations for teachers’ education programs
in order to increase the use of experiments and promote inquiry-based teaching. We test the
causality of the model using SEM in a longitudinal design: participating pre-service teachers
were surveyed up to three times at intervals of roughly six months regarding their beliefs,
attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural controls, behavioural intentions and actual
behaviour. We lag the dependent variable, the actual reported behaviour, by six months in order
to be sure of the causal direction. In doing so, we look specifically at causal mechanisms
responsible for influencing behaviour with regards to experiments and provide a more in-depth
look at how exactly teachers’ education can influence teachers’ behaviour.
In the following section, the central research questions will be formulated. After that, the
theoretical approach will be introduced. Here, we will discuss the TPB and how it will help
causally explain pre-service teachers’ behaviour with regards to experiments. In the Method
and Data section, the sample and data collection will be outlined. The empirical analysis
presents the results separately for pre-service teachers with the subjects’ biology and chemistry
and will begin with a descriptive look at the main variables of interest. Then, the results of the
structural equation models will be presented. To conclude the empirical analysis, we will
examine the underlying beliefs in a SEM framework. In the final section, the results will be
discussed in the context of their relevance to the discussion of how to improve natural science
lessons in the subjects’ biology and chemistry.

2. State of the research
This study applies the TPB (Fishbein & Ajzen 2010), currently one of the most commonly
applied theoretical approaches for looking at attitude and behavioural relations, to explain
teachers’ behaviour with regards to experiments. As will be shown, it provides a good basis for
analyzing lesson-related behaviour and may lend itself to analyzing various other teachers’
behaviours.
There is fairly large and growing body of research concerning the explanation and prediction of
teachers’ behaviour. To this end, the TPB has been applied in a wide variety of contexts. Some
studies, such as those of MacFarlane and Woolfson (2013), Mulholland and Cumming (2016),
Sharma and Jacobs (2016) look at teachers’ behaviour with regards to the inclusion of disabled
pupils, for example. Others, such as Stanec (2009) look at the use of fitness tests, while Wang
(2010) has examined so-called Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) in physical
education. Underwood (2012) investigated Japanese high school teachers’ behaviour with
regards to teaching English. Sadaf, Newby and Ertmer (2012) and Yusop (2015) look at
teachers’ use of Web 2.0 technologies.
A considerable amount of work has focused specifically on the behavioural control aspect of
the TPB, referring either explicitly to the theory or under the heading of ‘self-efficacy’
(Bleicher, 2010; Carleton, Fitch & Krockover, 2008; Cox & Carpenter, 1989). A lot of the
studies have looked at teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs in terms of the inclusion of pupils with
disabilities (Sharma & Sokal, 2015; Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2011). In other
words, what perceived personal or institutional hurdles hinder the inclusion of pupils with
disabilities?
Kilic, Emsen and Soran (2011) examined the use of experiments by teachers within the TPB as
a theoretical framework. Their sample consisted of 157 pre-service teachers at Ankara
Hacettepe University in Turkey in the subjects of biology, elementary science, physics and
5

chemistry. They found that attitudinal, normative and control beliefs strongly influenced
attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behaviour controls, respectively. Further, they found
attitudes have a strong influence on behavioural intentions. Perceived behavioural control and
subjective norms have moderately strong effects. However, their study is limited by several
factors. For one, their study is cross-sectional in nature and their model does not include any
measures of actual behaviour; it is truncated at intentions. Even if they had included a measure
of behaviour, it is likely the reports on behaviour would be influenced by the respondents’
reported intentions and, thus, the validity of the measure would be suspect. Furthermore, they
do not estimate separate models for the different subjects (which would likely have not been
possible with the small sample size and even smaller sub-groups).
The present study looks at teachers’ behaviour with regards to experiments that covers the entire
hypothesized model of the TPB. Our longitudinal design allows us to be more confident in the
casual direction of the relations. The sample size is sufficient to estimate separate statistical
models for biology and chemistry pre-service teachers and examine difference between the
subgroups. Furthermore, we surveyed every cohort of pre-service teachers at all the nine
different teaching colleges in Rhineland-Palatinate from 2012-2015. In doing so, we were able
to conduct a quasi-experiment by surveying the last cohorts of the old ‘state-exam’ model and
comparing them with the new ‘bachelor-master’ pre-service teachers.
3. Research question
The central research question of this study is straightforward: why (or why not) do natural
science teachers incorporate experiments into their lessons? To this end, we will apply the TPB
and attempt to statistically explain actual reported behaviour with regards to experiments. The
application of the TPB in explaining teachers’ behaviour will be of a confirmatory nature. In a
second, more exploratory step, we will furthermore investigate underlying beliefs that indirectly
influence the behaviour. While it is true that underlying beliefs are further removed from
6

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

behaviour in the causal chain of explanation, they are of essential practical importance for
generating recommendations for promoting the use of experiments.
A number of secondary research questions will be pursued as well. Firstly, do causal
explanations of teachers’ behaviour differ between the subjects of biology and chemistry? If so,
of what practical relevance is the knowledge of these differences for teachers’ education
programs? Secondly, based on the quasi-experimental nature of the study, we are also able to
explore whether pre-service teachers of the former “state-exam” model differ from those of the
new “bachelor-master” programs of study. As mentioned earlier, the introduction of the new
bachelor-master programs also brought with it an increased focus on didactics and educational
sciences. How has this structural reform affected either the prevalence experiments or causal
explanations for their use?
4. Theoretical approach
The TPB is one of the most widely used theories in the area of attitude-behaviour research. One
of the main benefits of the theory is the possibility for decomposing causal effects in multiple
mediator models within the overall causal model (Ajzen, 1985, 1991, 2005; Ajzen & Fishbein,
2000; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010). It describes how attitudes towards a behaviour, as well as
subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls or hindrances all exert an influence on
actual behaviour although they are mediated by behavioural intentions. Attitudes towards
behaviour, subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls are themselves the result of
cost-benefit considerations, evaluations and expectations about specific attributes related to the
attitude object or behaviour, referred to as beliefs (see Mayerl 2009 for an in-depth critical
discussion of the TPB). Figure 1 shows the theorized causal model of the TPB.

Ajzen, 2005: 135

The decision to conduct an experiment in the biology or chemistry classroom is the result of all
of these factors. Beliefs describe various, often subconscious, causal assumptions related to the
attitude object. Behavioural attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls
result from the sum total of behavioural, normative and control beliefs, respectively. People can
simultaneously hold both positively- and negatively-connotated beliefs. The overall tendency
of the attitude, from overwhelmingly positive to overwhelming negative, is based on the sum
of the sometimes competing views.
The behavioural belief that experiments lead to a better understanding of the subject matter will
likely influence a more positive attitude towards experiments, for example. Conversely, the
belief that experiments are time-consuming will negatively impact the attitude. Normative
beliefs involve assumptions regarding what is socially expected of oneself. A pre-service
teacher that believes pupils expect them to use experiments will feel pressure to actually do this
(subjective norm). Control beliefs are related to ideas about supporting and hindering factors.
For example, the belief that one does not have a strong enough grasp on the subject matter is a

8

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

9

behavioural control factor that may dissuade one from wanting to attempt to incorporate
experiments into lessons.
Behavioural intentions are influenced in part by attitudes, norms and behavioural controls. If a
pre-service teacher has, overall, a mainly positive attitude towards experiments, if they feel it
is expected of them by those whose opinions mean a lot to them, and if they feel they are in
control and capable of doing so, they will likely express the intention to perform the behaviour
and incorporate experiments into lessons. However, ultimately the model describes a stochastic
relationship and while intention influences behaviour, it does not determine it, statistically
speaking, as other confounding factors may also play a role in influencing behaviour. Such
possible confounders will be addressed further in the empirical analysis. Furthermore, the TPB
stipulates that behaviour can be directly influenced by behavioural control in the way that it can
present a type of knock-out criteria: while someone may have positive attitude, and feel pressure
by others to conduct experiments, a lack of behavioural control can negate intentions and
ultimately lead to the behaviour not being performed.
5. Method and data
The data was collected in the research project EVA3PLUS in the form of a computer-assisted
self-interview (CASI) survey of all biology and chemistry pre-service teachers in the second
phase of their education (in Germany this second phase is referred to as “Referendariat”) in
Rhineland-Palatinate from the winter semester 2013 to the winter semester 2017. 3,4 The
research design is a longitudinal panel study with participants taking part in intervals of roughly

EVA3PLUS was funded by the state Ministry of Education, Science, Further Education and Culture
RhinelandPalatinate (now Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture).

Although we conducted the surveys at all teachers’ training colleges in Rhineland-Palatinate to observe
population data, we had to deal with unit non-response. The exact response rate is not able to be determined without
records of pre-service teachers in Rhineland-Palatinate including data on drop-outs in the second phase of
education. In total, 47 surveys of the various educational institutions were successfully carried out. Illness and
absentness for other reasons prevented some pre-service teachers from taking part although the longitudinal nature
of the project meant we were often able to survey these people in at least one wave of data collection.

6 months for 3 waves of data collection. 631 individual surveys were carried out with 415
unique respondents. Pre-service teachers in Rhineland-Palatinate study two subjects. 335
respondents of this survey studied biology along with a second subject 5 (not including
chemistry), 151 studied chemistry along with a second subject (not including biology) and 145
respondents studied both biology and chemistry.
The TPB was operationalized to suit the research question by adapting indicators found in the
literature on the didactic method of experimentation in biology and chemistry lessons (see for
example Welzel et al, 1998; Weigelt & Grabinski, 1993).
The hypothesized model was operationalized using multiple-indicator latent structural equation
measurement models. Table 1 gives an overview of the latent constructs and their indicators.
All constructs display good reliability (Cronbach’s Alpha values > 0.7). In a confirmatory factor
analysis, the models showed high levels of both convergent validity (all standardized factor
loadings > 0.6) and discriminant validity (no cross-loadings) with a good model fit (

= 12.452,

df = 11, p = 0.3307, RMSEA = 0.018, C.I. (90%) = 0.000 –0.056, CFI = 1.000). The
operationalization of all constructs displays high levels of construct validity meaning we can be
confident in interpreting the results substantively.6
The TPB states that beliefs influence attitudes, norms and controls. Attitudes, norms and
controls influence behavioural intentions and intentions ultimately influence actual behaviour.
However, the TPB is not static and Ajzen states that past behaviour will influence future
behaviour either by reinforcing or changing previously held beliefs, attitudes, perceived social
norms and behavioural controls or by the generation of habits (Ajzen, 1991). For this reason, it

5

This could be mathematics, physics, geography, German, English or physical education.
The quality of the model can be evaluated using various “goodness of fit” indices. These indices report the extent
to which the theoretical model fits the empirical data. For an acceptable model-fit, CFI (“Comparative Fit Index”)
should be >0.950, RMSEA (“Root Mean Square Error of Approximation”) <0.050. Furthermore, the upper bound
of the 90%-confidence interval of the RMSEA should not exceed 0.100 (see Kline 2011; Loehlin 2004; Urban &
Mayerl 2014).

is important to establish the causal direction implied by the model. We do so by lagging the
independent variables by at least one wave of data collection. For the independent variables, we
took the first available data point. For the dependent variable behaviour, we took t+1 or, if that
data was missing, t+2. By doing so we can be surer of the causal direction of the hypothesized
structure. For the full hypothesized model, see Figure 3.
The following empirical analysis will attempt to explain pre-service teachers’ behaviour with
regards to experiments and will examine whether explanations differ between the subjects
biology and chemistry. This type of analysis involves looking at linear relationships between
predictors and outcomes: do increasingly positive attitudes towards experiments actually lead
to an increase in the frequency with which they are used in lessons, for example, and how strong
is this relationship? In comparative studies, however, we are sometimes not only interested in
whether one group differs from the other in terms of the presence and strength of these
relationships but also in differences in terms of base levels. Do chemistry and biology preservice
teachers already differ with regards to their base levels on either predictor or outcome variables?
To answer these questions, in the following section, we will first look at the univariate
descriptive statistics.
6. Empirical analysis
6.1. Descriptive statistics and overall levels

The descriptive statistics presented in Table 1 indeed already reveal some interesting
differences. Across the board, a strong link between the subject chemistry and experiments can
be seen. Respondents with the subject chemistry have more positive attitudes towards
experiments, feel more strongly that others expect them experiment in their lessons (social
norm) and feel more in control of their ability to experiment (behavioural control). Thus, it is
not surprising that they also express the intention to conduct experiments much more frequently
(intention) than respondents with the subject biology and, ultimately, they actually do use
11

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

12

experiments in their lessons much more frequently (behaviour). The pre-service teachers
surveyed with the subject chemistry replied, on average, that it was ‘rather likely’ that they
would experiment every fifth lesson in the next six months (I1, chemistry) and that they
intended to experiment around every 3th lesson (I2, chemistry). Biology teachers, on the other
hand, replied, on average, that it was neither likely nor unlikely that they would experiment
every 5th lessen in the next six months (I1, biology) and that they actually intended to only
experiment every 5th to 6th lesson (I2, biology). In both cases, the actual reported behaviour was
somewhat more infrequent than the average expressed intention. Chemistry pre-service teachers
in the study had experimented between every 3rd to 4th lesson in the previous six months (B,
chemistry) while those with the subject biology had only done so around every 5th to 6th lesson
(B, biology).
So, although it seems quite clear that pre-service chemistry teachers use experiments much more
often than their colleagues teaching biology, several important questions remain. First, the
univariate statistics only hint at causal relationships. Multivariate statistical models allow us to
examine partial effects after controlling for correlations between the independent variables
(which would appear to be substantial) and other possible confounders. The SEM framework
also makes it possible to examine multiple mediator models and gain a better understanding of
the overall causal structure. Second, the crucial question as to why remains. Answering these
questions will be the focus of the following empirical analysis.
The empirical analysis involves the estimation of structural equation models separately for
biology and chemistry pre-service teachers. The hypothesized causal model can be seen in
Figure 2. Models were estimated using Mplus 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2018). All
following models were estimated with a weighted least squares means and variance adjusted
(WLSMV) estimator which adjusts for the categorical nature of the indicators (Finney &
DiStefano, 2006). Model fit indices can be found below the figure. Control variables are not

shown in Figure 2 but included in model: the respondent’s subject combination (biology with
chemistry vs. not in combination), university at which pre-service teachers took their exam (A,
B, C vs. others), degree type (BA/MA vs. state exam), as well as variables for whether or not
intention was asked before or after behaviour and whether the item order was randomized or
not.

6.2. Causal Models

Full structural models were tested separately for a) those who studied chemistry along with
another subject and b) those who studied biology along with another subject. The following
Figure 2 shows the hypothesized model. SEMs are typically illustrated using such path
diagrams as the one shown here. Circles represent ‘latent’ factors representing the underlying
theoretical construct and boxes represent the indicators at the measurement level. One-headed
arrows imply a causal effect: x → y thus can be read as the hypothesized effect of “x on y”.
SEMs can be broken up into two overarching components: the measurement model and the
structural model. Measurement models specify the relationship between the latent theoretical
concepts and the indicators used to measure them. Latent factors are seen as the cause of the
scores on the indicators (i.e. Attitude → A1, A2, A3). The structural equations represent the
causal relationships between model components, thus attitudes are seen as the cause of
behavioural intentions, for example. Another important concept in SEM is the decomposition
of observed variance in ‘explained’ and ‘unexplained’. The causal relationships suggested in
the path diagram are calculated using multiple regression. Just as in typical regression analyses,
what results is a separation of variance that can be statistically explained by the independent
variable(s) and that which is not explained, the so-called ‘residual’ or ‘error’. Thus, for example,
indicator A1 is modeled as the additive result of the underlying latent attitude and an
unexplained residual. Residuals (or ‘disturbances’ if they are referring to the unexplained
variance of a latent factor) are represented by the arrows with no origin. They encompass the
effects of all other unobserved (and thus latent) influences (for an introduction to the concepts
of SEM see Schumacker & Lomax, 2004; Loehlin, 2004; Kline, 2011; Urban & Mayerl, 2014).
The variables shown at the bottom of the diagram have been chosen as controls, and in the case
of ‘university education’, which represents whether the respondent was of the old ‘state-exam’

15

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

16

or new ‘bachelor-master’ program of study, we actually have a more concrete substantive
interest in the effect.
To summarize, the model shows the latent factors for attitudes, subjective norm and behavioural
control measured by three, two and two manifest indicators respectively. Behavioural intention
is measured by two manifest indicators. The actual reported behaviour is measured by a single
manifest indicator (refer again to Table 1). Behavioural intention is the result of the combined
partial effects of attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural control, as well as the control
variables for subject combination, the university at which one studied, the program of study
(pre- or post-reform) and the survey method7, plus an unobserved error term. Behaviour is the
result of behavioural intention, the control variables and the error term.
The two-headed arrow connecting the attitude-indicators A1 and A3 indicate a correlation
between the residuals of these indicators (also referred to as ‘error covariance’). This means
there is systematic variance common to A1 and A3 that is not accounted for by the latent
construct. In this specific case, the indicators A1 and A3 are both negatively worded in contrast
to the positive indicator A2. This is why A1 and A3 share systematic error variance.
Not shown are covariances specified between the so-called ‘exogenous’ variables, or those
without any arrows pointing towards them (attitudes, subjective norms, behavioural control and
the control variables) and between the control variables and the other three exogenous latent
factors. Here, the resulting coefficients of the specified correlations (two-headed arrows) are
interpreted in the same way that the causal effects (one-headed arrows). Specifying a correlation
instead of a causal effect simply illustrates that we do not have any concrete hypotheses about
the relationship and are primarily concerned with holding their effects constant.

These last two variables control for the influence of the randomized question orderings in the survey.

16

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

17

Again, effects are the result of multiple regressions in which the covariances between
independent variables in an equation are first partialled out. This means the coefficients must
be interpreted as marginal effects, holding the effects of all other influences constant.

Not shown: covariances between control variables and between control variables and attitudes,
subjective norms and behavioural controls

The following Figure 3 shows the structural model results for respondents with chemistry along
with another subject (n = 192). Model fit is good with CFI = 0.995 and RMSEA = 0.039.
For the empirical model results, the discussion of the measurement models in which normally
the standardized factor loading scores of the indicators on the latent constructs is the focus, will
be forgone. In each case, the measurements showed no serious cause for concern with
standardized factor loadings ≥ 0.5, in all but one case even ≥ 0.7. When comparing effects
17

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

18

within models, the standardized effects will be shown. This makes it possible to compare effects
of variables with different scaling directly. Results displayed in the path diagrams are also the
standardized effects. Later, when the two models are compared with each other, the
unstandardized effects will be displayed as the calculation of standardized coefficients are
sensitive to the specific characteristics of individual models (see Urban & Mayerl, 2014). As a
final note, only the significant (p < 0.05) coefficients will be discussed and shown in the figures.
Due to the model complexity, it would not be possible to clearly show all the specified
coefficients in the figures. Also, discussing each non-significant path would likely become
tiresome for the reader.
The respondent’s attitude towards experiments in Chemistry has a moderate, statistically
significant effect (0.223, p < 0.01) on their intention to carry out experiments in lessons.
Respondents with more positive attitudes towards experiments actually do express significantly
stronger intentions to experiment. Behavioural control has an even larger effect (0.376, p <
0.001). This indicates that the subjective assessment of the respondents’ ability to use
experiments is an even stronger predictor of intention than the attitude. Subjective norms
involving perceptions of what others expect of them has no significant effect on behavioural
intentions. It is important to point out that this does not mean that pre-service teachers with the
subject chemistry do not feel pressure from others to experiment – in fact, the subjective norm
to do experiments is actually higher amongst the chemistry teachers than the biology ones (refer
back to Table 1). Rather, although they perceive the subjective norm, it does not affect the
behavioural intention to implement experiments in teaching Chemistry – it is the personal
attitude and especially the behavioural control which do matter.
Respondents with both subjects chemistry and biology reported a significantly weaker intention
to experiment (-0.168, p < 0.05). Thus, in the group of chemistry pre-service teachers, the

18

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

19

influence of the second subject of study being biology was enough to pull the intention
significantly downward.
We furthermore observe several significant correlations between the control variables and the
exogenous latent factors. One particular university, (University C) was associated with
significantly more positive attitudes towards experiments as well as stronger subjective norms
(p < 0.01).8 This is an interesting result and raises questions about whether we should interpret
this to mean that this university ‘caused’ more positive attitudes and stronger subjective norms
on average, or whether and to what extent a selection bias in the sense of preferences of specific
students towards choosing to study at a specific university is at play. Also, interesting from a
methodological standpoint, we observe a random question order in the survey had a
significantly positive effect on latent attitudes.
The model is able to statistically explain 38% of the variance of the latent factor behavioural
intention for Chemistry (this is a common explanation power for TPB, see for example Ajzen,
2005). Behavioural intention itself has a strong positive effect (0.468, p < 0.001) on the actual
reported behaviour of the respondent at least half a year later. Furthermore, as postulated by the
TPB, for respondents with the subject chemistry, behavioural control has a significant positive
direct effect on the reported behaviour (0.221, p < 0.05). Around 43% of the variance of the
variable behaviour can be statistically explained by the model, which again is quite usual for
TPB.

Because the results here could be used in ways that they were not intended and generally to avoid sparking
conflict in Rhineland Palatinate’s higher education political scene, we have anonymized the universities.

Not shown: non-significant effects and covariances of control variables.

For respondents with the subject biology, all three factors play a significant role in influencing
behavioural intention: Both subjective norms and behavioural control have moderate significant
positive effects of around 0.24 (p < 0.001) on behavioural intention. Attitudes towards
experiments have a slightly stronger influence of 0.282 (p < 0.001).
This time, respondents with the subject biology from University C actually displayed a
significantly lower intention to experiment than the other universities (-0.171, p < 0.05). Refer
back to the finding that, amongst the chemistry pre-service teachers, this same university was
associated with more positive attitudes and stronger subjective norms which then themselves
lead to higher intentions to experiment.

29% of the variance of the latent factor behavioural intention was statistically explained by the
model. Behavioural intention has a strong significant effect on the actual reported behaviour at
least half a year later (0.511, p < 0.001) and the model can statistically explain 32% of the
variance of the variable behaviour. As opposed to respondents with the subject chemistry, there
is no significant direct structural path going from behavioural control to behaviour.

Thus, to sum up, there are three most striking differences between the subjects of Chemistry
and Biology. Firstly, subjectively perceived social norms are an important predictor for Biology
pre-service teachers as opposed to Chemistry pre-service teachers who are not concerned with
the social pressure to do experiments. This may simply be the result of the difference between
21

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

22

these two subjects: Chemistry is always about experimental work, no matter what others think.
On the contrary, Biology is not necessarily an experimentally orientated subject. Here, the social
peer groups are important to strengthen the behavioural intention to actually implement
experiments in teaching. Secondly, another interesting finding is that in the case of Chemistry,
the strongest predictor of intentions is the perceived behavioural control to actually do
experiments in school. Thirdly, behavioural control does even directly affect actual behavior
for chemistry pre-service teachers. This is not the case for biology. Here, behavioural control
affects behavior only indirect, mediated by the intention to do experiments. This additionally
points out that behavioural control is indeed the most important factor to explain the
implementation of experiments in the case of chemistry.
We now turn to the foundation of the three overall judgments ‘attitude’, ‘subjective norm’ and
‘behavioural control’ in order to identify which substantial beliefs may be the driving forces of
hindering or facilitating the implementation of experiments in teaching natural sciences at
school.
6.3. Salient Beliefs

Beliefs are, as Ajzen and Fishbein describe, subjective probabilities (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010).
Beliefs inform us about how the world works. Implicitly, they define assumed causal
relationships and help individuals decide the probability that performing behaviour x will lead
to outcome y. They are the foundation of the TPB and attitudes, subjective norms and
behavioural control. More specifically, these three constructs are the result of the sum total of
the multiple, sometimes conflicting beliefs held about a behavioural object. Attitudes are thus
the spontaneous and mostly unconscious weighing of beliefs surrounding a behaviour object.
So, after now having found that attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural control
significantly effect actual behaviour with regards to experiments, the task becomes to
investigate the underlying beliefs as the fundamental but indirect causes of behaviour. In doing
22

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

23

so, we identify (to apply a German saying) what screws can be turned; i.e. if positive attitudes
lead to more experimenting, what can be done to ensure teachers develop positive attitudes?
Salient beliefs refer to the most relevant beliefs for the formulation of attitudes. Fishbein and
Ajzen (2010) refer to them as “beliefs about the object that come readily to mind” (p. 98). They
are the ones that play the biggest role in determining how people react to an attitudinal object.
For our study, the relevant salient behavioural, normative and control-related beliefs were
determined in a pre-test study conducted at our university with a total of n = 77 students of
biology and/or chemistry. After having determined the salient beliefs, we included them in the
main study for each of the respondents to address. The following section will look at salient
beliefs as determinants of the following latent factors in the causal chain. We again estimate
SEMs separately for biology and chemistry pre-service teachers. We look specifically at causal
relationships between each of the salient beliefs on the corresponding latent factor. For each
belief, we receive a regression coefficient for its effect on the construct. The control variables
from the previous structural models were included here as well but not shown in the figures.
Model fit indices can be found below the figures. In short, the model fit is good in both cases,
thus the results can be interpreted substantially.

university (dummies A, B, C vs. others), degree (BA/MA (1) vs. State Exam (0)), question order

For the respondents with the subject chemistry (see Figure 5), we observe that none of the salient
behavioural beliefs generated in the pre-test had a significant effect on attitudes. This is due to
the relatively small sample size and too-large standard errors. The beliefs that experiments
“Make lessons appealing” (0.129, p < 0.1) and “Teach pupils about using devices in practice”
(0.124, p < 0.1) were significant at the 10% level.

24

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

25

For subjective norms, the belief that “University instructors” expected the respondents to use
experiments had a fairly strong positive effect (0.421, p < 0.001). The expectations of the pupils
also had a slight but significant impact for chemistry pre-service teachers (0.163, p < 0.05). The
expectations of other actors such as subject instructors, parents, school directors and colleagues
did not put chemistry pre-service teachers under pressure to use experiments.
Several beliefs had moderate to strong significant effects on perceived behavioural control. The
strongest predictor for behavioural beliefs was “Necessary knowledge lacking” (-0.503, p <
0.001); respondents in the group chemistry that felt they did not have a grasp on the subject
matter felt much more restricted in the behaviour. “Long preparation times” was another factor
that lead to respondents expressing doubts as to their capability to use experiments (-0.230, p <
0.001). Respondents that felt they had their “Own ideas for experiments” (0.214, p < 0.001) and
that the given “Equipment and facilities” were sufficient (0.150, p < 0.001) felt more confident
in their ability to use experiments.

university (dummies A, B, C vs. others), degree (BA/MA (1) vs. State Exam (0)), question order
(1/0) and item randomization (1/0), no significant effects of control variables.

For pre-service teachers with the subject biology (see Figure 6), several behavioural beliefs
were shown to significantly affect attitudes. Respondents that believed experiments “Teach
pupils about using devices in practice” (0.290, p < 0.01), “Make lessons appealing” (0.232, p <
0.01) and “Combine theory and practice” (0.172, p < 0.05) had more positive attitudes.
Interestingly, the belief that experiments “Interest the pupils” actually lead to more negative
attitudes towards using experiments (-0.222, p < 0.01). It seems that pre-service teachers who
26

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

27

want pupils to be highly interested in the subject doubt that doing experiments helps to stimulate
this interest.
On the other hand, for the subject biology, respondents reported that the expectations of the
pupils (0.153, p < 0.05) are the only ones that put them under pressure to use experiments.
Those of the other groups had no significant effects on subjective norms.
Similar to the subject group chemistry, behavioural control for the biology pre-service teachers
was influenced negatively by the belief that the “Necessary knowledge is lacking” (-0.530, p <
0.001). The beliefs that experiments entail a “Long preparation time” (-0.245, p < 0.001) also
made them feel less in control. When the respondents felt they had their “Own ideas” (0.201, p
< 0.001), the “Equipment and facilities” were suitable (0.164, p < 0.01), and the behaviour of
the pupils was conducive (0.107, p < 0.05) they tended to feel more volitional control. On the
other hand, the “Curriculum guidelines” actually seemed to impede biology pre-service
teachers’ perceived ability to use experiments (-0.109, p < 0.05).
7. Summary of results and discussion
This study looked at causes for the use of classroom experiments by biology and chemistry
preservice teachers. The structural models showed that TPB is able to explain 29-38% of the
variance of behavioural intention with respect to applying experiments in the classroom, and
32-42% of the variance of actual behaviour (using experiments in the classroom). These results
point to the applicability of the TPB in explaining behaviour in teaching natural science-related
subjects.
The structural models showed furthermore in both groups that attitudes towards experiments do
indeed influence the intention to carry out experiments in lessons. This was more so true for the

27

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

28

subject biology (unstandardized regression coefficient9 0.449, p < 0.01, see appendix for the
unstandardized results) than chemistry (0.401, p < 0.01).
Subjective norms play only a role for respondents with the subject biology (0.305, p<0.01). For
the subject chemistry, subjective norms have no significant effect on the intention to
experiment.
In both groups, behavioural control influences to a large extent the intention to use experiments.
This is particularly relevant for the group with the subject chemistry (0.450, p < 0.001 vs. bio:
0.274, p < 0.01). Most importantly, however, is the fact that stating the intention to use
experiments actually lead to higher reports of experimentation upwards of six months later. In
the group with chemistry, intention had an unstandardized effect of 0.783 (p < 0.001) and
biology 0.745 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, while in the group biology behavioural control is
mediated completely by intention, for chemistry we observe a significant unstandardized direct
effect (0.442, p < 0.05) meaning intention only partially mediates the effect of behavioural
control on reported behaviour. For the subject chemistry, even those expressing an intention to
experiment can ultimately be hindered by a perceived lack of ability to do so.
In a second step, the relevant salient beliefs as the underlying factors were examined. It was
shown that the attitudes of chemistry pre-service teachers towards experiments were not
sufficiently explained by any of the salient beliefs generated in the pre-test. For this group, there
may to be other, unidentified factors at work. However, the statistical power of this particular
model was likely insufficient to rule out type 2 errors. For the group of biology pre-service
teachers, the strongest predictor of positive attitudes was the beliefs that experiments taught
students about the practical use of devices and that they made their lessons more appealing.

9

In order to compare across models, we must look at the unstandardized results. However, because the variables
were scaled the same way in both groups, this is unproblematic.

28

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

29

If chemistry pre-service teachers felt their university instructors and pupils expected them to
use experiments, they felt pressure to actually do so. For biology pre-service teachers, the
expectations of the pupils alone were what put them under pressure to use experiments. The
opinions of the other groups seemed to be rather irrelevant.
Finally, in both groups, the respondents’ perceived ability to incorporate experiments into their
lessons was most strongly influenced by their grasp on the subject matter. Other factors, such
as the facilities available and the wealth of one’s own ideas, also influence their confidence in
their ability to use experiments.
The examination of the important salient beliefs provides the most direct implications for
decisions and policy. In order to cultivate positive attitudes towards experiments amongst
biology teachers, it may be wise to emphasize their usefulness in familiarizing pupils with
scientific devices, for example. For both groups, pressure put on pre-service teachers by their
subject instructors at the teaching colleges (“Fachleiter”) will not likely lead to an increase in
experiments because their expectations were not particularly relevant in the formation of an
intention to do experiments in teaching. On the other hand, it may be wise to communicate or
allow the pupils themselves to express their desire for more experiments because the opinions
of the pupils do seem to matter. And, as for overcoming hurdles, it seems like the best way to
ensure pre-service teachers feel confident in their ability to experiment is to ensure they have
an excellent grasp on the subject matter. Making sure the necessary equipment is easily
available and that the facilities are suitable is an obvious, and now empirically shown important
prerequisite.
As for some of the more secondary findings, it was interesting that, in the group with the subject
chemistry, those who had biology as well expressed a significantly lower intention to
experiment than those with any other combination of second subjects. In the group biology, it
can be observed that university C, on an institutional level, is itself responsible for respondents
29

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

30

expressing less intention to experiment. Here in order to sensibly evaluate the effect it would
be necessary to look for substantive reasons within the university as to why this is the case. The
fact itself that while controlling for all the other influences in the model one university still is
capable of exerting a negative influence on the intention to experiment is striking10.
One major finding is the lack of any significant effects of the degree type (bachelor-master vs.
state exam) on either intention or behaviour as well as the antecedent attitudes, norms or
controls (which were modelled as covariates rather than structural effects, the results of which
can, however, be interpreted the same). The results show that although attitudes, norms and
controls play varying roles in determining behaviour in the two subject groups, bachelor-master
students do not differ from those of the old state exam model. While the decision to carry out
experiments is influenced by one’s confidence in their own subject-related education (see the
strong significant effect of the salient belief “Necessary knowledge is lacking”), this itself is
not influenced by whether or not one studied before or after the reform. The only indication we
could find in contrast to this was a nearly marginally significant (p = 0.134) correlation in the
group chemistry between degree type with behavioural control of -0.108 indicating those who
studied bachelor-master programs may feel slightly less well equipped to carry out experiments.
This confirms previous results of this research team in which we showed that while bachelormaster-degree pre-service teachers reported feeling significantly better prepared for teaching in
terms of subject didactics and educational sciences, they differed almost not at all from state
exam pre-service teachers in terms of their subject-related educations (Hornung et al. 2015,
Thyssen et al. 2016).

10

A look at the covariances was also not able to elucidate this any further. There was a significant negative
covariance with the variable for degree type indicating a larger proportion of the respondents of this university
were of the older state exam model. However, as can be seen in the model diagrams above, both intention and
behaviour do not seem to be influenced by degree type.

30

ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR RELATIONS IN TEACHING

31

The increased emphasis in the new study programs on didactics and educational sciences were
feared to lead to a neglect of the subjects themselves leading to cohorts of teachers first,
scientists second. This, however, does not seem to be the case. The reform of teachers’
education programs in Germany, at least in Rhineland-Palatinate, is not just a net improvement
but rather an absolute one as there seem to be no deficits but only benefits arising from it.
This study is one of the first and likely the most comprehensive to empirically investigate
teachers’ behaviour with regards to experiments in the natural science classroom. It was shown
that the TPB is a useful theoretical framework for this and other similar investigations. In a
longitudinal design, we examined and compared the causes for biology and chemistry
preservice teachers’ use of experiments as well as the underlying beliefs and provided insight
on ways of achieving the normative goal of increasing the use of experiments in the
experimental natural science subjects. Future work may focus on replicating these results for
samples in other geographic locations as well as for other natural science subjects such as
physics.

The standardized factor loading for item C1 of greater than 1.0 resulted from an error variance of nearly zero.
Manually constraining the error variance to something very small (0.001 for example) solved this problem but had
no impact on the model results. 1.006 and 1.042, when rounded, can be still be interpreted as an explained variance
of 1.0 by the latent factor Control.
