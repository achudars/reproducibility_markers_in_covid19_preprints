ABSTRACT: Political scientists have acknowledged the importance of nationalism as a constitutive element of radical-right politics, but have typically empirically reduced the phenomenon to its downstream attitudinal correlates. Sociologists, on the other hand, have extensively studied nationalism, but have only
sporadically engaged in debates about institutional politics. In this study, we
bring these literatures together by considering how nationalist beliefs shaped respondents’ voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the
election outcome built on long-term changes in the distribution of nationalism
in the U.S. population. The results suggest that competing understandings of
American nationhood were effectively mobilized by candidates from the two parties, both in the 2016 primaries and the general election. Furthermore, over the
past twenty years, nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and
Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood. These trends point to the rising demand for radical candidates among
Republicans and suggests a potentially bleak future for U.S. politics, as nationalism becomes yet another among multiple overlapping social and cultural cleavages
that serve to reinforce partisan divisions and undermine the stability of liberal
democratic institutions.

Introduction
There is an emerging consensus in the political science and sociology literature that
contemporary radical-right politics—a category that subsumes most European rightwing parties, but also Donald Trump’s presidency, and the Brexit referendum—
consists of three constitutive elements: populism, exclusionary nationalism, and authoritarianism (Bonikowski 2017a; Mudde 2007; Rooduijn 2014)1 . While much recent
1

The technical term “radical right” is commonly used in the literature and is
preferable to other labels that conflate the form of politics in question with one of
its ideological components (e.g., “populism”) or that privilege one component over
others (e.g.,“populist radical right”). We rely on it in the paper for this reason. At
the same time, we acknowledge that the “radical right” label is problematic, because
2

research has sought to define, measure, and examine the political consequences of
populist attitudes (Akkerman et al. 2014; Oliver and Rahn 2016; Schulz et al. 2017;
Van Hauwaert and Van Kessel 2018), the careful theorization and operationalization of nationalist beliefs has received comparably less attention, as has the study
of the relationship between nationalism and political preferences. Instead, political
scientists have focused on downstream phenomena that comprise what they call “cultural” factors explaining radical-right support. These include xenophobia, racism,
Islamophobia, and anti-cosmopolitan backlash. In this paper, we address this gap
in the literature by bringing insights from cultural and political sociology to the
study of institutional politics. Specifically, we use original survey data to inductively
identify multiple varieties of popular American nationalism and examine their relationship to respondents’ voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential primary
and general elections. We then rely on repeated cross-sectional surveys of nationalist
attitudes administered in 1996, 2004, 2012, 2014, and 2016 to investigate whether
long-term trends in the distribution of nationalist beliefs, both in the aggregate and
across the two U.S. national parties, help account for Donald Trump’s rise to political
prominence.
Our analyses reveal that four distinct types of American nationalism, which we label creedal, disengaged, restrictive, and ardent (cf. Bonikowski and DiMaggio 2016),
played an important role in the 2016 presidential election. Each of these four nationit assumes a single political continuum that cannot account, for instance, for parties
that combine economic redistribution with exclusionary nationalism. We also note
that our use of the term is not normative or pejorative, in that it does not conflate
all right-wing politics with the radical right, nor does it preclude the existence of a
radical left, which carries its own particular political challenges.
3

alism types represents a unique combination of 23 variables measuring strength of
national attachment, inclusive or exclusionary criteria of legitimate national membership, domain-specific national pride, and chauvinism (i.e., the belief that America
is superior to other countries). Importantly, in terms of their attitudinal composition, the resulting nationalism types are cross-cutting rather than monotonic, so that
they cannot be arranged on a single continuum from least to most nationalist. To
aid in the interpretation of our arguments—and foreshadow our subsequent empirical findings—we illustrate the composition of the nationalist schemas in terms of
their four constitutive components (i.e., attachment, membership criteria, pride, and
chauvinism) in Table 1.
Even after controlling for sociodemographic covariates and partisan identification,
adherence to restrictive and ardent nationalism (both are exclusionary, but the former
is characterized by moderate national attachment and low levels of national pride
and chauvinism, and the latter by high levels of all three) was significantly predictive
of endorsing Trump over the moderate candidates in the Republican primary and
of voting for Trump over Clinton in the general election. Moreover, a disengaged
disposition toward the nation (consisting of inclusive criteria of belonging and low
levels of attachment, pride, and chauvinism) was predictive of support for Sanders
over Clinton in the Democratic primary, and for Trump over Clinton in the general
election. These results are placed into further relief by a striking finding from our
longitudinal analysis: while the three conceptions of America associated with Trump
support did not become more prevalent in the U.S. population prior to the 2016
election, there is strong evidence of persistent partisan sorting of nationalist beliefs

over the past two decades. Whereas the four varieties of nationalism observed in our
study had cut across partisan identification in 1996, by 2016, respondents identifying
with the Republican Party predominantly subscribed to exclusionary, unproud, and
chauvinistic conceptions of nationhood, while a large majority of those identifying
with the Democratic Party saw the nation in inclusive and positive terms.
These results point to the centrality of nationalist beliefs in contemporary U.S.
politics. Differences in popular conceptions of nationhood appear to have transformed over time from latent cultural cleavages—correlated with political attitudes
but not primarily driving political behavior—to active political cleavages that have
been effectively mobilized by recent presidential campaigns, most successfully so by
Donald Trump’s exclusionary and anti-elite appeals. Moreover, although nationalist
beliefs are not reducible to partisanship (as evidenced by the persistent marginal
effects of nationalism in our statistical models), the increasing correlation between
these two types of identities is likely to reinforce other sociodemographic and ideo-

5

logical cleavages, potentially leading to greater partisan animosities and diminished
prospects for political compromise in the coming years (Manza and Brooks 1999;
Rokkan and Lipset 1967; Mason 2018; Jardina 2019).
The paper proceeds as follows. We begin with a discussion of existing explanations for the rise of radical-right politics and argue that scholars have not sufficiently
engaged with the sociological literature on popular nationalism, a crucial politicalcultural phenomenon that is likely to have played a key role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Following a description of our data and methods, we use latent class
analysis to identify four distinct varieties of American nationalism among our survey
respondents. Based on the content of these attitudinal configurations, we develop
hypotheses about the possible relationships between respondents’ nationalist beliefs
and their voting preferences. These predictions are also informed by our review of
campaign media coverage and a supplementary computational text analysis of campaign speeches, which allow us to characterize how nationalist claims were utilized
by the 2016 primary candidates and presidential nominees. We formulate additional
hypotheses concerning the long-term trends in the distribution of nationalist beliefs
during the two decades preceding the 2016 election. We then turn to our empirical
results. First, we regress candidate support in the primary and general elections on
the four types of nationalist beliefs, along with relevant controls. Second, we track
changes in the aggregate proportions of the nationalist cleavages in the sample as
a whole and within the Democratic and Republican Parties. We conclude with the
implications of our results for understanding contemporary U.S. politics and the rise
of the radical right across democratic polities.

“Cultural” Sources of Radical-Right Support
Explanations of popular support for radical-right parties tend to fall into two categories: those stressing economic factors, such as exposure to financial crises, income
inequality, deindustrialization-driven unemployment, trade shocks, or the redistributive consequences of capital mobility, and those emphasizing “cultural” factors, such
as racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, or a backlash against cosmopolitanism (Golder
2016).2 Economic explanations claim that a range of structural shocks have generated a growing sense of precariousness in local communities, particularly among
white working-class individuals residing outside of major urban centers (Morgan and
Lee 2018), and that the resulting economic anxiety has led these voters to favor
anti-establishment candidates on the radical right (Autor et al. 2016; Colantone and
Stanig 2018; Guiso et al. 2017; Rodrik 2018). Right-wing politicians have effectively
mobilized economic discontent through their vocal opposition to economic globalization and their moral vilification of liberal elites, as well as immigrants and minorities.
The latter in particular have been portrayed as recipients of unfair advantages in access to jobs, educational institutions, and welfare state programs.
In contrast, what political scientists refer to as “cultural” explanations focus on
the primary role of out-group stigmatization in driving radical-right support. This
2

In addition to explaining the demand side of radical-right politics, political scientists stress the importance of institutional mechanisms, such as changes in candidate
selection processes and the weakening of party organizations, as well as the impact on public opinion of the rise of social media and the growth of partisan cable
news (Golder 2016; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018). We bracket these factors, because
our interest is primarily in the relationship between political claims-making and
individual-level correlates of political behavior.
7

perspective rests on the claim that economic anxiety is neither a necessary nor sufficient cause of voters’ favorability toward candidates who capitalize on out-group antipathies. Instead, it is voters’ deep-seated racism and xenophobia (Ivarsflaten 2008;
Lucassen and Lubbers 2012; Mutz 2018; Sides et al. 2018)—or a general distaste for
multicultural and cosmopolitan cultural norms (Norris and Inglehart 2018)—that
gives resonance to such campaign messages, especially under conditions of collective
status threat (Bobo 1999; Parker 2016). In addition to furnishing correlations between the relevant attitudes and radical-right support, those favoring cultural explanations often point to the weaknesses of the economic framework: that radical-right
supporters tend not to be the worst off in society, that they often oppose economic
redistribution (especially if it involves benefits for the groups they dislike), and that
racial segregation is a more typical characteristic of the areas in which these voters
live than is having borne the brunt of economic decline (Sides et al. 2018).
Whatever the empirical merits of each side (for a relevant recent exchange, see
Morgan 2018b and Mutz 2018), the economy-versus-culture debate suffers from two
conceptual problems. First, its central dichotomy is arguably misplaced (Gidron and
Hall 2017), because it ignores the fact that culture shapes economic perceptions (e.g.,
sociotropic economic concerns can be based not only on personal experience but also
assessments of how people in one’s reference group are faring compared to those
in perceived out-groups [Citrin et al. 1997; Hochschild 2018:137–140]) and that economic anxieties are themselves mediated by cultural frames (e.g., it is only those economic shocks that are perceived as unfair that tend to activate radical-right support
[Rodrik 2018]). Second, and more relevant for our purposes, the debate subsumes

8

under “culture” a wide range of attitudes, including xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia, and anti-cosmopolitanism, without specifying the cultural mechanisms that
connect them (but see Jardina 2019; Lubbers and Coenders 2017; Mason 2018; Rydgren 2017). While these phenomena are easily operationalized, they are theoretically
thin and analytically inadequate, not least because they are able to explain radicalright support only in some cases but not others. For instance, Islamophobia is useful
for understanding the successes of the National Front (now the National Rally) in
France, but xenophobia against Polish immigrants is more relevant for making sense
of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. case, the vilification
of Mexican migrants was centrally important to the Trump campaign while overt
racial claims were less prominent than racial dog-whistles (Bobo 2017; Lamont et al.
2017)—and yet, both racism and anti-immigrant sentiments were highly predictive
of people’s decision to vote for Trump (Sides et al. 2018).
One way in which scholars have sought to bridge these distinct phenomena is to
subsume them under the category of nativism: the principle “that states should be
inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (‘the nation’) and that nonnative elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogenous
nation-state” (Mudde 2007:19). This is a more promising analytical category than
“culture” writ large, because it places emphasis on definitions of legitimate membership in the nation, which are core to people’s collective identities. Nativism,
however, is overly narrow: it customarily emphasizes foreign birth over other bases
of nationalist exclusion (Higham 1955; cf. Bonikowski 2017a; Manza and Crowley
2018; McVeigh and Estep 2019) and it misses other aspects of nationalism besides

9

membership criteria, such as domain-specific national pride and perceptions of national superiority. Together, these beliefs constitute people’s cultural schemas of the
nation, which have important implications for political preferences and are empirically tractable using survey data.3 . Bringing these configurations of nationalist (as
opposed to merely ‘nativist’ or ‘cultural’) beliefs to bear on the 2016 U.S. presidential
election is the primary objective of this study.

Nationalist Cleavages in the United States
In his influential book Civic Ideals, Rogers Smith (1997) demonstrates that American national identity has never been characterized by singular adherence to the
liberal values of the American Creed. Instead, it has vacillated between distinct and
competing belief systems (liberalism, but also republicanism and ascriptive Americanism), the residues of which Smith traces across the patchwork of U.S. citizenship
law. The notion that conceptions of nationhood are heterogeneous within countries has also motivated survey researchers, who have shown that similar distinctions
to those observed in archival data are found in public opinion, and that these beliefs are strongly associated with policy preferences (Citrin et al. 2001; Edgell and
Tranby 2010; Theiss-Morse 2009; Schildkraut 2010). More recently, Bonikowski and
DiMaggio (2016) used inductive survey analysis methods to identify distinct schemas
of American nationhood. Their findings differed from past studies in three impor3

Another advantage of “nationalism” is that it allows for direct comparisons between different varieties of the phenomenon, a strategy we employ in this paper. It
is less clear what constructs should be employed in juxtaposition with “nativism.”

tant ways: (1) they were based on a wider range of items that tapped criteria of
national membership, national pride, chauvinism, and the strength of national attachment; (2) instead of aggregating variables (as in factor analysis, for instance),
they clustered respondents based on the latter’s shared attitudinal profiles; and (3)
they demonstrated that the resulting configurations of nationalist beliefs were not
only patterned and correlated with political preferences, but also largely invariant in
their composition over time.4
Bonikowski and DiMaggio’s (2016) results suggest that alternative types of nationalism can be thought of as cultural cleavages in the U.S. population, which function as the public-opinion counterparts to the policymaking traditions documented
by Smith (1997). These cleavages are likely to be latent during settled historical
times, operating largely in the cultural background. Under such circumstances, nationalist beliefs may manifest themselves in micro-interactions, as either sources of
in-group cohesion or inter-group animosity, but not as primary features of electoral
campaigns or voting behavior (though their downstream policy correlates may well
4

Although our measurement of nationalism and the resulting typology is inspired
by Bonikowski and DiMaggio (2016), our study innovates in a number of important
ways. First, we focus on the relationship between nationalism and voting preferences
rather than general social and political attitudes. Second, we examine long-term
trends in nationalism beliefs using five waves of survey data, extending the analysis
into the second term of the Obama presidency and the 2016 election. Third, the
emphasis in our temporal analysis is on the sorting of nationalist beliefs by party and
not solely on aggregate changes in the population. Fourth, our research contributes
to literatures on polarization and the rise of radical politics in both sociology and
political science. Fifth, our hypotheses are informed by an analysis of campaign
discourse, which allows us to integrate the supply and demand sides of politics in
our study and shed light on how radical actors mobilize support through nationalist
claims-making.

be more salient). Occasionally, however, a confluence of structural conditions, particularly those that threaten existing ethnoracial status hierarchies, may bring disputes
about the nation’s meaning to the forefront of political claims-making and individuallevel political preferences (Anderson 2016; Bobo 1999; Jardina 2019; McVeigh and
Estep 2019; Parker and Barreto 2014; Parker 2016). Given the prominence of antiminority discourse in contemporary radical-right politics, the current era appears to
represent precisely such a conjuncture.5
Why should we expect nationalist beliefs in general—and not just exclusionary
conceptions of national membership—to affect people’s political preferences? For
one thing, past research has shown that national attachment, chauvinism, and pride
are important predictors of social and political attitudes. Strong identification with
the nation has been associated with xenophobia (Ariely 2012; Pehrson et al. 2009),
particularly when threats to the nation are made salient in political discourse (Li and
Brewer 2004). Similarly, chauvinism—which political psychologists equate with nationalism tout court—has been correlated with support for aggressive foreign policy,
authoritarianism, antipathy toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and opposi5

We view our work as complementary to the existing literature on the role of
racism and white nationalism in U.S. politics (e.g., Anderson 2016; Jardina 2019;
Kendi 2017; Smith 1997). The nationalist belief types we identify encompass ethnoracial exclusion, which has been a central feature of American political culture since
the country’s founding. Our conceptual framework, however, is flexible enough to
encapsulate other bases of exclusion in the U.S. and elsewhere, including those based
on religion, language, and cultural values. Moreover, the nationalist beliefs on which
we focus are not limited to criteria of national belonging, but extend to the strength
of national attachment, domain-specific national pride, and chauvinism. These are
distinct components of nationalist schemas, even if their meaning is partly shaped
by their relationship to people’s inclusive or exclusionary beliefs. We return to this
point in subsequent sections of the paper.

tion to supranational institutions (Blank and Schmidt 2003; de Figueiredo Jr and
Elkins 2003; Feinstein 2016a; Huddy and Khatib 2007; Kosterman and Feshbach
1989; Müller-Peters 1998). The findings for national pride are more equivocal: high
levels of pride can be associated with stronger national identification and support
for national institutions without generating out-group hostility (Blank and Schmidt
2003; Evans and Kelley 2002; Gangl et al. 2016), but in some circumstances pride
has also been correlated with ethno-racial exclusion (Li and Brewer 2004), social
dominance orientation (Sidanius et al. 1997), and disregard for democratic principles (Parker 2010).6 These conflicting results point to the polysemy of nationalist
attitudes (and of cultural meaning more generally): what each attitude means and
what implications it has depends on which other attitudes it is associated with in an
individual’s belief system. To capture this mutual conditionality of nationalist beliefs, our study relies on relational survey analysis methods (specifically, latent class
analysis) that identify groups of respondents with common patterns of responses
across multiple survey questions. We describe this approach in more detail in the
methods section.
Our focus on the full range of nationalist beliefs is also motivated by the fact
that exclusionary conceptions of nationhood are not the only prominent discursive
frame employed in contemporary radical politics. On both the right and left, radical
candidates tend to deploy trenchant moral critiques of the nation’s political, cul-

6

Political psychologists label these two tendencies as blind and constructive patriotism, respectively (Schatz et al. 1999). We do not employ these terms because we
view them as unnecessarily normative, but also because we find the term ‘patriotism’
to be a misnomer for what is actually a core dimension of nationalist beliefs.
13

tural, and economic trajectory, often seeped in nostalgia for its long-lost glory and
accompanied by promises of widespread systemic change. Such tropes are commonly
associated with the populist vilification of morally corrupt elites, who are blamed for
leading the nation in the wrong direction and whose removal is seen as a prerequisite
for national restoration. Donald Trump’s inauguration speech featuring the dark
symbolism of “American carnage” is case in point, but a more restrained variant of
this dystopian register can also be observed in the left-populist campaign of Bernie
Sanders. In contrast, mainstream candidates are more likely to celebrate the nation’s
accomplishments and limit their critique to policies that can be addressed through
incremental reforms rather than systemic change. These distinct moral assessments
of the nation’s circumstances are especially likely to resonate with the evaluative
aspects of voters’ nationalist beliefs, such as domain-specific pride and chauvinism.
If we find that nationalism did in fact influence the 2016 election, the next question is whether this was a result of shifts in the prevalence and distribution of nationalist beliefs in American society. One possibility is that a growing proportion
of Americans came to hold nationalist beliefs consistent with the Trump campaign’s
messaging in the months leading up to the 2016 primary and general elections, perhaps as a consequence of the campaign itself or contemporaneous exogenous shocks
that engendered a sense of symbolic threat among the white majority. Such a pattern
would be consistent with media accounts of a sudden surge in nativism, xenophobia, and racism in 2015 and 2016 (e.g., Guynn 2016; Stevens 2016). Yet, there are
multiple reasons to be skeptical of this scenario.

14

First, past research has shown that out-group hostility in the U.S. population
has been constant or has declined over the past decade (Jones 2019; Sides et al.
2018; for similar findings among whites, see Morgan and Lee 2017). It would be
surprising if the distribution of nationalist beliefs contradicted this trend. Second,
even though Trump harnessed exclusionary discourse in his campaign, he did not
invent it: racist, anti-immigrant, and Islamophobic frames had long been a feature of
Republican politics and conservative media (Anderson 2016; Bail 2014; Gilens 2009;
Parker and Barreto 2014). Third, even though a confluence of economic, social,
and cultural changes may have affected the self-perceived status of white Americans,
it would be difficult to argue that 2015 or 2016 witnessed major punctuations in
such contextual trends. Fourth, while the Trump campaign may have undermined
existing norms of acceptable speech and behavior, political science research on the
limited size and durability of campaign persuasion effects (as opposed to short-term
priming and turnout effects) suggests that it is unlikely for Trump’s rhetoric to have
produced major attitudinal changes in the population (Gerber et al. 2011; Iyengar
and Simon 2000; Jacobson 2015). Together, these arguments imply that a sudden
shifts in nationalist beliefs immediately prior to the election are less probable than
more crescive trends or perhaps even attitudinal stability.
A related but analytically distinct question is whether the demand for Trumpstyle nationalist politics has increased among some segments of the population, and
possibly declined among others. Such a scenario could underlie a variety of aggregate
patterns in the population, including long-term attitudinal stability. A particularly
relevant source of division in contemporary U.S. political culture is partisanship. A

15

large literature on polarization has shown that even though Americans’ attitudes have
been generally stable (with some exceptions, like those concerning abortion), they
have become increasingly sorted by party (Baldassarri and Gelman 2008; DiMaggio
et al. 1996; Fiorina and Abrams 2008; Hetherington and Weiler 2009), in part due
to persistent cues from polarized political elites (Druckman et al. 2013; Layman
and Carsey 2002; Levendusky 2009). As a result, people’s partisan identities have
become highly predictive of their beliefs and vice versa, their attitudinal profiles
have become indicative of their partisanship. There is considerable debate about the
origins of polarization—with frequently cited causes including Southern realignment
(Rohde 1991), rising immigration and inequality (McCarty et al. 2016), Congressional
redistricting (Carson et al. 2007), changes in candidate selection mechanisms (Stroud
2010), the nationalization of U.S. politics (Hopkins 2018), and the transformation of
the media landscape (Levendusky 2013)—but there is relative consensus about its
dangers. As a growing number of issue positions come to overlap with party identity
and the parties become divided along sociodemographic dimensions, there are fewer
issues that can generate bipartisan consensus and there is less room for meaningful
debate between the two partisan camps (Abramowitz and Webster 2016; Jones 2001;
Mason 2018). The resulting mutual reinforcement between multiple social, political,
and cultural cleavages threatens social cohesion and democratic stability (Manza and
Brooks 1999; Rokkan and Lipset 1967).
It is possible that nationalist beliefs represent yet another cultural domain that
has undergone partisan sorting over the past two decades (Hanson and O’Dwyer
2018). Not only would this be consistent with the broader trend toward polarization

16

in U.S. political culture, but it would also help explain support for Donald Trump’s
exclusionary and anti-system politics—and perhaps that of predecessor movements
and candidates like the Tea Party and Sarah Palin—in the presence of aggregate stability in nationalist beliefs: even if demand for this type of politics did not increase
in the population as a whole, it may have grown among the subset of (predominantly
white) Americans who identify with the Republican Party. We investigate this possibility using repeated cross-sectional data on nationalist beliefs that span the two
decades between 1996 and 2016. If nationalism did become increasingly sorted by
party in this time period, this would represent an additional cultural cleavage overlaid upon existing, and increasingly proliferating, divisions in U.S. political culture.
The implications of such a development would be particularly concerning for the
country’s political stability. After all, definitions of nationhood are not simply another policy issue; they give meaning to master identities that constitute people’s
collective sense of self. If Americans cannot agree on what their country means to
them, what lessons to draw from its past, and what core principles should guide its
future path, this is likely to further exacerbate zero-sum partisanship—predicated on
perceiving the political opposition as fundamentally un-American—that poses a dire
threat to the country’s liberal democratic institutions (Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018).7

7

Our empirical focus is on the U.S., but the conceptual and methodological approach we develop is intended to be easily extended to other cases of radical-right
politics, even if partisan sorting is likely to take on distinct forms in multi-party systems (perhaps operating via cleavages between party families or between traditional
and new parties). Should future research find a more general cross-national trend in
the polarization of nationalist beliefs, this could represent an important contributing
factor to the rise of radical politics in contemporary democracies.

Data and Methods
The main data used for the cross-sectional analysis of the 2016 election were collected
by YouGov on November 5-6, the weekend before Election Day, as part of a larger
comparative survey on nationalism funded by the U.S.-Israeli Binational Science
Foundation. The sample of 956 respondents was drawn from YouGov’s panel using
Census-based quotas and then matched to the U.S. non-institutionalized population
using post-stratification weighting.
The survey asked respondents a wide range of questions about their collective
identities, social attitudes, and political preferences. Our study focuses in particular
on a battery of twenty-three items that measure multiple aspects of popular nationalism, including strength of national attachment, criteria of legitimate membership
in the nation, domain-specific national pride, and chauvinism. This battery was
directly modeled on questions from the General Social Survey—collected under the
auspices the International Social Survey Programme—which have been the subject
of numerous scholarly studies (e.g., Huddy and Khatib 2007; Kunovich 2009; Wright
2011). The wording of the nationalism questions along with the descriptive statistics
for the 2016 wave of data are provided in Appendix A. We perform listwise deletion
on all observations with missing data on the nationalism variables, which yields a
sample size of 782.8
Our dependent variables are voting preferences in the 2016 primary and general
elections. The fact that the data were collected only a couple of days before Election

In the results section, we consider whether listwise deletion affected our findings,
by comparing them to those generated with a multiply imputed dataset.

Day allows us to obtain reliable measures of vote intention (Atkeson 1999) among
a sample that includes late-deciders, a particularly important group in the 2016
election (Morgan 2018a). At the same time, because we have no information about
respondents’ actual voting behavior, we are cautious to interpret our findings as
indicative of candidate support rather than candidate vote. Finally, data on primary
vote choices are based on retrospective accounts and are therefore susceptible to bias
in favor of the primary winner. The overestimation of the primary winners’ votes,
however, should make our results more conservative.9
For the longitudinal analysis, we rely on a unique dataset of nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional surveys that feature a consistent set of nationalism
items. We compile these from the 1996, 2004, and 2014 General Social Surveys
(GSS), a 2012 GfK Custom Research Survey, and the 2016 YouGov data described
above. The GSS is a long-established and highly reputable attitudinal survey in the
United States, collected annually by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC)
at the University of Chicago through in-person interviews and full-probability sampling. The nationalism items were administered as part of the National Identity
I, II, and III supplements coordinated by International Social Survey Programme.
The 2012 GfK survey was administered through the company’s KnowledgePanel, an

Under the null hypothesis of no relationship between nationalism and primary
vote, the retrospective overestimation of Trump and Clinton support should make
little difference, while under the alternative hypothesis, it should have a downward
bias on the nationalism coefficients, by conflating true Trump/Clinton primary supporters who espouse one set of nationalist beliefs with false-recall supporters who
espouse contrasting conceptions of the nation.

online panel initially recruited by random-digit dialing and address-based sampling
methods (N = 3,136; 58.5 percent response rate).
All five surveys featured 23 identical nationalism items, along with a consistent set
of sociodemographic variables. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting composite
dataset represents the most complete time series of Americans’ nationalist beliefs
available to researchers. The data cover a period of important developments in U.S.
politics—including rising polarization, growth in executive power, the September 11,
2001 attacks, and the Great Recession—spanning the Clinton, Bush, and Obama
presidencies, and the 2016 presidential election. The weighted descriptive statistics
for the five waves of data are shown in Table 2.
To identify varieties of American nationalism, we use latent class analysis (LCA),
a data reduction method that groups observations based on their shared response
patterns across multiple indicators—in this case, the twenty-three nationalism indicators specified earlier. We do so both for theoretical reasons—because we view this
relational and inductive approach as most appropriate for measuring domain-specific
cognitive representations (Mohr 1998; Knight and Brinton 2017)—and for practical
reasons, because this has been a method effectively used in past research to segment
nationalist beliefs in survey data (Bonikowski and DiMaggio 2016; Bonikowski 2017b;
Alemán and Woods 2018), making possible direct comparisons between our results

and those of past studies and contributing to the cumulation of knowledge in this
domain of inquiry.10
The logic of LCA is combinatorial, in that it is the configuration of multiple
attitudes rather than the net effect of each attitude that is assumed to matter for a
given outcome. As an example, consider a hypothetical survey respondent’s stated
opinion that speaking English is an important criterion of national belonging. Based
solely on this attitudinal response, it is difficult to determine whether the respondent
in question adheres to an exclusionary or a civic republican conception of nationhood
(i.e., whether he or she sees language as basis for legitimate ethnic exclusion or
simply as an important prerequisite for full participation in the nation’s economy
and politics). One way to distinguish these alternative dispositions is to observe the
same respondent’s answers to other nationalism items: if the respondent also sees
ancestry and birth in country as important criteria of nationalist membership, it is
likely that he or she adheres to exclusionary beliefs; if the respondent does not endorse
ascriptive criteria of belonging but instead places importance on people’s respect for
the country’s laws and institutions, we can conclude that he or she adheres to civic
republican ideals. Similarly, the contradictory findings of past research concerning
the invidious or benign consequences of national pride suggest that the implications
of pride for political preferences are likely to be conditional on other aspects of a given
10

Our commitment to conceptualizing and measuring meaning in relational terms
draws on a long—and arguably, dominant—tradition in cultural sociology (see
DiMaggio 1997; Mohr 1998; Zerubavel 2009). In recent years, scholars have drawn
on this work to propose combinatorial and relational methods for empirically measuring cultural schemas (Boutyline and Vaisey 2017; Goldberg 2011; Hunzaker and
Valentino 2019; Yeung 2005); we see our approach as part of this broader effort.
24

respondent’s nationalist beliefs. By clustering respondents based on their responses
to multiple survey items, LCA enables these types of relational distinctions.
In technical terms, LCA uses a set of indicator items to estimate a latent categorical variable and predict a posterior probability of each respondent obtaining a
particular value on that latent variable (McCutcheon 1987). Each value on the latent
variable corresponds to a discrete latent class and the posterior probability represents
each respondent’s likelihood of assignment to each class. Using modal classification,
respondents are then assigned to those classes for which their probability of assignment is highest. The LCA algorithm, implemented in the software package Latent
Gold 5.0, uses maximum likelihood and the Newton-Raphson method to simultaneously estimate multiple model parameters under the assumption that conditional on
the latent variable, the indicator variables are independent (in practice, this assumption can be relaxed for specific pairs of indicators with highest model residual scores,
a model fitting technique we take advantage of in our analysis) (Vermunt 1997).
Our use of a discrete rather than continuous latent modeling strategy, such as
confirmatory factor analysis, necessarily sacrifices some of the variation observed in
the sample. We view this cost, however, as well worth the analytical payoff. In light
of our arguments about the relationality of nationalist beliefs, an adequately specified continuous latent approach would require multiple continuous factors—at least
one each for attachment, inclusive/exclusive criteria of national belonging, pride,
and chauvinism (but likely more, as shown by Kunovich 2009)—and regressions of
vote choice on these factors would likely involve multi-way interactions. Such a model
would be extraordinarily difficult to interpret. A discrete latent approach, such as la-

25

tent class analysis, is far more parsimonious: it automatically identifies those unique
combinations of responses that are prominently represented in the data without the
need for complicated interaction models. To further justify our modeling choices, we
directly compare results obtained with both LCA and confirmatory factor analysis
in Appendix B.
The LCA models in all of our analyses are fully heterogeneous; that is, both
content (i.e., the conditional probability of a particular response to each nationalism
indicator within each class) and the posterior distribution of the latent classes in
the sample is allowed to vary (Kankaraš et al. 2012). We employ this strategy in
order to inductively determine whether the content of classes is broadly stable from
year-to-year and to examine how the prevalence of the resulting classes changes over
time. As we shall demonstrate, the heterogeneous model yields highly comparable
classes across survey waves, with only minor year-specific variations that are likely
due to measurement error. We rely on statistical goodness of fit and interpretive
criteria to select the appropriate number of classes. As in past studies, a fourclass solution provides the best compromise between precision and interpretability
(besides not offering an advantage in model fit, the addition of a fifth class does not
add theoretically meaningful information to the analysis). For more details about
model selection and the comparability of the resulting LCA classes over time, see
Appendix C.
Once we identify the four types of nationalism in the data, we regress on them
respondents’ voting preferences in the general and primary elections.11 To do so,
11

In the initial LCA models, we reweight the data so that each of the five waves
26

we use logistic regression and report the results in terms of predicted probabilities
and average marginal effects (AMEs). Unlike logit coefficients or odds ratios, AMEs
enable direct cross-model comparisons; furthermore, similarly to predicted probabilities, they are expressed in the natural metric of the dependent variable (Long and
Mustillo 2018; Mize et al. 2019). The term “effect” should not be mistaken for causal
language, however; in our application, AMEs are indicative of associations not causal
effects.

Varieties of American Nationalism
The LCA analysis yields four types of nationalist beliefs, summarized in Figure
1.12 Following Bonikowski and DiMaggio (2016), we label them creedal, disengaged,
restrictive, and ardent (despite the addition of the 2014 and 2016 waves of data,
our LCA results bear a strong resemblance to theirs). Creedal nationalists favor
elective criteria of national belonging, rating subjective identification with the nation
and respect for American laws and institutions as very important; they are more
equivocal than others about importance of life-long residence and language skills,
and view birth in the country, having American ancestry, and being Christian as
not very important. They display moderate levels of national pride (with pride in
America’s scientific accomplishments ranking highest and pride in its social security
system ranking lowest) and low levels of chauvinism (e.g., only 26 percent agree that
contributes equally to the results. In subsequent analyses, the weights are rescaled
to the actual sample size for each wave.

27

the world would be a better place if others were more like Americans). This response
pattern is broadly consistent with the central tenets of the American liberal creed
(Lipset 1967).
The disengaged class is characterized by an arm’s length relationship to the nation, which for some, may verge on dissatisfaction with and perhaps even animus toward it. Respondents in this group do not view any criteria of national membership
as particularly important (and thus understand the nation’s symbolic boundaries in
inclusive terms), they are not especially proud of any aspect of American nationhood,
and they do not view America as exceptional or superior compared to other countries.
While we hesitate to go so far as to label these respondents as “non-nationalist” or
“post-nationalist,” it does appear that for at least some of them, the national frame
of reference is not particularly salient. To the degree that some of these respondents
do find America meaningful, they are likely to view in negative terms, given that they
espouse the lowest levels of national pride in the sample. Given these characteristics,
the absence of overt nationalism in Bernie Sanders’ campaign—but also his negative
evaluation of the economic foundations of U.S. society—may have held particularly
strong appeal for these respondents. It is also possible, however, that Trump’s darkly
dystopian depiction of America resonated with the low levels of national pride among
some of the disengaged.
Finally, Restrictive and ardent nationalists endorse both elective and ascriptive
criteria of national belonging, rating them all as very important (with the importance of Christian faith ranking lowest, endorsed by 73 percent of ardents and 76
percent of restrictives). The two classes differ, however, in their degree of attach-

28

ment to the nation, pride in America’s accomplishments, and their evaluation of the
country’s relative standing in the world. Restrictive nationalists exhibit considerably
lower levels of attachment and pride than ardent nationalists and these differences
are most pronounced for the pride items related to national institutions, such as
pride in the way the country’s democracy works (with 11 percent of restrictives expressing strong pride compared to 70 percent of ardents), its political influence in the
world (7 vs. 55 percent), and its economic achievements (14 vs. 73 percent). With
respect to chauvinist attitudes, restrictives are also less effusive in their celebration
of American exceptionalism than ardents, with, for instance, only 41 percent of the
former, compared to 71 of the latter, strongly agreeing that America is better than
most countries, and 45 percent of the former, compared to 62 percent of the latter,
endorsing the idea that the world would be a better place if others were more like
Americans.
For restrictive nationalists, unlike ardent nationalists, then, high barriers to national membership are accompanied by muted affect toward the nation—and the
state—at least in its contemporary form. The fact that pride in America’s history
is an exception to this pattern suggests that restrictive nationalists may espouse a
sense of nostalgia for a (real or imagined) bygone America, one that is at odds with
contemporary social and cultural changes (Lipset and Raab 1970). If so, this would
place their beliefs squarely in line with the rhetoric of the Trump campaign, epitomized by its campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.” At the same time,

the exclusionary and chauvinistic beliefs of the ardent nationalists are likely to have
attracted them to the Trump message as well.13

Hypotheses
Our interest in the relationship between the four types of nationalism and voting
preferences is based on the observation that candidates in the 2016 presidential election consistently invoked nationalist rhetoric in their campaigns. Donald Trump
is the most obvious example. His primary and general election messaging escalated xenophobic, religious, and racial fear-mongering to levels not seen in decades,
by unabashedly portraying Mexican migrants as immoral and dangerous, MexicanAmericans as un-American, and Muslim refugees as national security threats (Balz
2016). This rhetoric emerged out of Trump’s earlier championing of the “birther”
movement, which questioned the legitimacy of President Barack Obama as an elected
official and a native-born American. Against this backdrop, Trump’s persistent appeals to white working- and middle-class Americans had a decidedly white nationalist
undertone, only further reinforced by his refusal to disavow the support of extremist
movement leaders like former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Lamont et al. 2017).
Trump also consistently depicted America as a nation that had lost its way, hav13

Our measures of exclusionary conceptions of national belonging could be interpreted as capturing xenophobia rather than broad antipathy toward a wide range
of ethnic, racial, and religious minority groups. We reject this interpretation on the
basis of a voluminous literature on ethnic nationalism, past studies that have shown
the same items to be adequate measures of broadly exclusionary beliefs, and our
own supplementary analyses of the relationship between the four nationalism types
yielded by LCA and racial attitudes. For more details, see Appendix E.
31

ing been dominated by corrupt liberal elites who routinely prioritize the interests of
immigrants and minorities over those of “real” (read: white, non-urban) Americans
(Mercieca 2020). Trump promised to “Make America Great Again” by “draining
the swamp” of corruption, restoring U.S. jobs, and defending the collective status
of his predominantly white supporters (not least through restrictions on immigration, as epitomized by his infamous border wall). Thus, his discourse invoked not
only exclusionary notions of national identity, but also a dark, populist vision of
a morally debased nation that had been led astray by enemies within, a narrative
that echoed the combination of attitudes—ethno-cultural exclusion, low pride, and
chauvinism—typical of restrictive nationalists, but that may have also appealed to
ardent nationalists (through exclusion) and the disengaged (through low pride).
Donald Trump was not, however, the only Republican to make these types of
claims. Ted Cruz, though less explicit, was eager to compete with Trump on the
latter’s terms, frequently signaling his toughness on immigration and his national
security bona fides (Raju 2016). Moreover, like Trump, Cruz portrayed America in
negative terms, as having been subjected to the nefarious influence of self-interested,
morally corrupt political and intellectual elites (Kazin 2016; Newmyer 2015). By
imbuing their nationalist vision with nostalgic and populist themes (Bonikowski and
Gidron 2016; Gest et al. 2018), both Cruz and Trump sought to reach voters who were
dissatisfied with the national status quo and yearned for a bygone era, presumably
one in which white, Christian Americans occupied an unquestionably dominant place
in the status hierarchy (Whitehead and Perry 2020). In contrast, the remaining
candidates for the Republican nomination either downplayed nationalism altogether

32

or relied on boilerplate patriotic imagery typical of creedal nationalism (Brooks 2015;
Thompson 2015).
On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton’s campaign was more centrally concerned
with policy proposals than identitarian appeals, but when she did reference nationalist claims and imagery, she did so in a decidedly creedal register, depicting America
as an exceptional imagined community whose egalitarian ideals and human achievements are deserving of deep national pride (Karni 2016). These themes were featured
especially prominently in the Democratic National Convention, the overtly patriotic
pageantry of which bore striking resemblance to traditional Republican campaigns
(Hohmann 2016). In contrast to Clinton, her chief rival in the primary election,
Bernie Sanders, eschewed nationalism altogether and focused instead on a broadly
populist economic message, one that vilified corporate and moneyed elites for having
corrupted U.S. politics in pursuit of policies that systematically hurt the interests of
everyday Americans (Cassidy 2016; Kim 2015). In formal terms, this deeply moral
discourse shared some features with Trump’s populism, even if the policy consequences and target constituencies of the two candidates differed sharply (Bonikowski
and Gidron 2016).14
14

Given the dearth of empirical studies of campaign content during the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, the above characterization of the candidates’ discourse has been
based primarily on media reports. To further ensure that our assessments of the
campaigns—and the resulting expectations concerning the relationship between nationalism and candidate support in the 2016 primary and general elections—are
correct, we performed a systematic analysis of the candidates’ campaign speeches,
using word embeddings, a vector-space method for representing word similarities in
a given corpus (Mikolov et al. 2013; Kozlowski et al. 2019). The conclusions were
consistent with our expectations. For more details about the data, methods, and
results, please see Appendix F
33

In light of these discursive patterns, we can generate some broad expectations
for the survey data analysis. We divide our hypotheses between those concerning
voters’ preferences in the Republican and Democratic primaries and those specific to
the general election.15 In generating the former hypothesis, we were guided by the
combinatorial logic of our theoretical approach and corresponding survey analysis
methods: rather than looking for net effects of particular attitudes, we were concerned with which configurations of beliefs—represented by the four latent classes—
were likely to have been activated by each candidate. This approach assumes that
political mobilization outcomes are multicausal, that is, that they are the result of
multiple concurrent causal pathways (Viterna 2006). In general, this means that different voters may favor the same candidate for distinct reasons, but more concretely
within the scope of our study, it also suggests that the nationalist discourse of a

15

Given the strength of partisan identification in the United States and the resulting prevalence of party-line voting, the question of why Donald Trump won the
general election may appear less interesting than why he was able to capture his
party’s nomination in the first place. We challenge this assumption on two grounds.
First, although it is true that in typical elections Republicans tend to vote for the
Republican nominee and Democrats for the Democratic nominee with turnout being a differentiating factor for the election outcome, 2016 was not a typical election
precisely because the Republican nominee was so unabashedly nationalist. To the
degree that Republicans voted for Donald Trump, they did so either because they
endorsed his extremist claims or because they did not see those claims as sufficiently
objectionable to warrant withholding their support. This suggests that nationalism
among Republicans may have been a crucial factor in the general election and not
only in the primary. Second, if nationalism were to be predictive of Trump or Clinton
support even net of partisan identification, this would suggest that some partisans
defected from their party loyalties—or that independents were swayed one way or
another—based on their nationalist beliefs. For both of the above reasons, we see
the analysis of general election voting preferences as important.
34

given candidate may simultaneously resonate with different types of nationalism in
the electorate.
In general terms, we expect Donald Trump’s supporters to be particularly likely
to espouse forms of nationalism that privilege ethnoculturally exclusionary criteria
of national membership (Manza and Crowley 2018), low levels of national pride,
and moderate to high levels of chauvinism. Three of the four types of nationalism
identified by our latent class analysis fit this profile. The closest match for Trump’s
discourse is found among the restrictive nationalists, who combine exclusion with low
pride (especially in institutions) and moderate chauvinism (consistent with Trump’s
alarmist depiction of contemporary American society and his disparaging view of the
rest of the world). At the same time, his campaign is likely to have appealed to ardent
nationalists as well, because of their strong endorsement of all exclusionary barriers
to national membership, extreme chauvinism, and prideful exultation of the nation
that is in line with traditional Republican beliefs. The third potentially relevant
configuration of nationalist beliefs is found among the disengaged: although these
respondents are broadly inclusive when it comes to the nation’s symbolic boundaries,
their extremely low lever of national pride may have favorably predisposed some of
them toward Trump’s dystopian narrative.
All three of these patterns should be particularly notable in the general election,
since the Clinton campaign invoked a sharply contrasting view of the nation that
would have appealed to voters espousing inclusive definitions of national membership,
high levels of national pride, and at most moderate levels of chauvinism—that is, to
creedal nationalists. This suggests the following two hypotheses:

35

Hypothesis 1 (Trump support in the general election): In the general election,
support for Trump, as opposed to Clinton, was significantly associated with adherence
to restrictive, ardent, and disengaged conceptions of American nationhood, whereas
support for Clinton over Trump was significantly associated with adherence to creedal
nationalism.
In the primaries, we should observe little difference in the nationalist beliefs of
Trump and Cruz supporters, given that both candidates engaged in persistent appeals to ethnocultural exclusion, the moral vilification of elites, and a dystopian
nostalgia for an idealized national past. The attitudinal profiles of respondents who
favored mainstream Republican candidates, like John Kasich, Jeb Bush, and Marco
Rubio, however, should differ sharply from Trump (and Cruz) supporters. Given the
less exclusionary and more exultant conceptions of America invoked by the mainstream Republican candidates, we should expect their supporters to share the creedal
nationalist beliefs of Clinton voters, even if the two groups would have fundamentally
disagreed on other political issues.
For Democratic primary candidates, the main difference between Clinton and
Sanders supporters should consist of endorsement or rejection of affirmative nationalism, respectively, with Sanders supporters more likely to be disengaged from the
nation (i.e., to view national membership in inclusive terms, while expressing low
levels of national pride and chauvinism.). Sanders’ use of populist rhetoric may have
found appeal among this group as well, given their low level of pride in both the
nation and the state. These predictions lead to the following three hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2 (Trump vs. Cruz in the Republican primary): In the Republi-

36

can primary election, there should be no significant differences in nationalist beliefs
between Trump and Cruz supporters.
Hypothesis 3 (Trump vs. moderates in the Republican primary): In the Republican primary election, support for Trump, as opposed to the mainstream candidates,
should be significantly associated with adherence to restrictive, ardent, and disengaged
conceptions of nationhood.
Hypothesis 4 (Clinton vs. Sanders in the Democratic primary): In the Democratic primary election, support for Sanders, as opposed to Clinton, should be significantly associated with a disengaged conception of nationhood.
We conclude with hypotheses concerning the temporal trends in nationalist beliefs, which are informed by competing explanations of Trump’s success identified
in the literature and described earlier in the paper. The first considers the possibility of a sudden surge in restrictive, ardent, and disengaged nationalism—the
attitudinal configurations we hypothesized to predict Trump support—in the sample as a whole prior to the 2016 election. Such a trend would be consistent with
common arguments in the media that Trump’s victory was enabled by—and itself
catalyzed—short-term shifts toward ethnoracial exclusion and institutional distrust
among white Americans. The second, alternative hypothesis focuses on the possibility of long-term partisan sorting in nationalist beliefs, which could have stemmed
from earlier historical events (e.g., 9/11, the Iraq War, right-wing responses to the
Obama presidency) and been further exacerbated by Republican Party strategy long
before Donald Trump captured the party in 2016.
Hypothesis 5 (nationalist surge): Ardent, restrictive, and/or disengaged con-

37

ceptions of nationhood increased in prevalence between 1996 and 2016, reaching a
peak prior to the 2016 election.
Hypothesis 6 (partisan sorting): Ardent, restrictive, and/or disengaged conceptions of nationhood became more closely associated with Republican partisan
identification between 1996 and 2016, while creedal nationalism became more closely
associated with Democratic partisan identification in the same time period.

Results
Nationalism in the 2016 Election
Having generated the latent classes and assigned respondents to each using modal assignment based on posterior membership probabilities, we regress self-reported voting
preferences on class assignment. We do so using stepwise logistic regression, beginning with a baseline model, then adding respondents’ sociodemographic attributes
(birth in the U.S., age, gender, race, geographic region, income, education, and religion) in the second model, and partisan identification in the third model (we include
partisanship only in the general election analyses). All analyses were carried out
in LatentGold and Stata using a three-step model with a Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars
(BCH) correction for classification bias, along with sampling weights (Bakk et al.
2013; Bolck et al. 2004; Roberts et al. 2018). For ease of interpretation, we focus our
discussion and visualizations on the nationalism variables, but the complete regression results and model comparisons are available in Appendix G.

38

General Election
The results of the general election models are presented in the top-left panels of
Figures 2 and 3. The former illustrates the average marginal effects of the nationalism classes on vote intention and enables direct between-class comparisons, whereas
the latter visualizes the predicted probabilities of candidate support for respondents
belonging to each nationalism class (for reference purposes, the solid horizontal lines
in Figure 3 indicate the level of candidate support in the sample as a whole).16,17
Consistent with our expectations, in the baseline model, creedal nationalism is
negatively associated with Trump support, compared to support for Clinton, whereas
restrictive and ardent nationalism are both positively associated with intention to
vote for Trump. The average marginal effect (AME) of the disengagement class on
Trump support is positive, but it does not reach significance. Once we account for
respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics and the partisan distribution of nationalism, however, an even clearer picture emerges: creedal nationalism is a consistent and significant predictor of respondents’ intention to vote for Clinton, whereas
adherence to ardent, restrictive, and disengaged conceptions of nationhood is significantly associated with Trump support (see Appendix G for model comparison
tests).18
16

When dealing with factor variables, average marginal effects represent the average discrete change from the reference category in the probability of the outcome.
17
Note that the confidence intervals demonstrate uncertainty in the predictions
and are not testing statistical significance between the predictions and the mean
vote share for the sample, represented by the solid horizontal lines. See Figure 2 for
direct tests of the differences in estimates between the four nationalist clusters.

In supplemental analyses, we examined the relative importance of race and nationalism in the models. Appendix G demonstrates that both sets of variables are

These results are in line with Hypotheses 1. Trump’s campaign discourse activated nationalist beliefs among the American public that consisted of varied configurations of exclusionary conceptions of national membership (for ardents and restrictives), low levels of national pride (for restrictives and the disengaged), and
moderate-to-high levels of chauvinism (for ardents and restrictives). Conversely,
Clinton’s emphasis on diversity and positive evaluations of the nation mobilized voters who subscribed to creedal conceptions of nationhood, characterized by inclusive
criteria of national membership, high pride, and moderate chauvinism.
In addition to supporting our first hypothesis, these results suggest that the pathways through which nationalism mobilized voters’ support for Trump were indeed
multicausal: whereas Trump’s campaign discourse was most closely aligned with restrictive nationalism, some of its features also resonated with the nation schemas
of the ardents and the disengaged.19 Importantly, given the relational logic of our
analytical approach, these patterns should not be interpreted in the conventional
framework of ‘net effects’ of specific components of nationalism (e.g., criteria of
membership, pride, or chauvinism), but rather as the aggregate associations of the
overall attitudinal configurations captured by the latent classes with respondents’
voting preferences. The appeal of radical-right discourse is therefore not limited to
claims based on ascriptive in-group identity and out-group hostility, but rather on
independently associated with general election voting preferences, whereas Appendix
H shows that race only modestly mediates the relationship between two of the nationalism classes—the disengaged and restrictives—and support for Trump over Clinton.
These mediation results—and the race coefficients—cease to be statistically significant once partisan identification is included in the models.

For a comparison of these results with those generated by continuous latent
factors, see Appendix B.
42

their synthesis with populist critiques of political elites and institutions, moral indictments of the nation’s trajectory, a nostalgic glorification of the nation’s past, and
a chauvinism critique of the international order.
While supportive of our theory, the persistently significant AMEs of nationalism
in the model that controls for partisan identification may be seen as counterintuitive. As suggested by the literatures on partisan polarization, motivated reasoning,
and negative partisanship (for a recent synthesis, see Mason 2018), partisan identity
typically outweighs all other predictors of vote choice in U.S. presidential elections.
Once candidates are chosen by the parties, Republicans tend to vote for a Republican and Democrats for a Democrat, regardless of who is at the top of each ticket
(Bartels 2016). In the full model, the party marginal effects are indeed large and
highly significant (see Appendix G), but this does not reduce to non-significance the
associations of the ardent, restrictive, and disengaged classes with Trump support.
Was it the case then that partisans crossed party lines based on their nationalist
beliefs to support the opposing party’s candidate?
The answer to this question appears to be a qualified ‘yes.’ To better understand
the sources of the persistent association of nationalism with vote choice, we ran
the same general-election model with an interaction between party and nationalism.
The results, presented in Figure 4, demonstrate that the observed pattern was driven
primarily by Democrats. Those Democratic respondents who subscribed to ardent
and disengaged conceptions of nationhood were significantly more likely than their
creedal counterparts to support Trump over Clinton. In contrast, none of the AMEs
for Republicans and Independents are significant. Considering the potent discursive

43

mix offered by the Trump campaign, this result makes sense: a small minority of
Democrats whose nationalist beliefs were consistent with Trump’s messaging were
sufficiently mobilized by it to abandon their partisan commitments in favor of their
nationalist aspirations. On the other hand, Clinton’s conventional creedal nationalism did not offer a comparably tempting alternative for Republicans to do the
same.
We have shown that nationalism was predictive of candidate support in the general election, but is the magnitude of the differences in voting intentions between the
four nationalist classes substantively meaningful? Figures 2 and 3 suggest that it
is. In the baseline model, the probability of a creedal nationalist voting for Donald
Trump is 0.17, compared to 0.37 for a disengaged respondent, 0.48 for an ardent
nationalist, and 0.67 for a restrictive nationalist (the mean for the sample as a whole
is 0.43). In other words, creedal nationalists were nearly four times less likely than
restrictives and more than twice less likely than ardents to support Trump. Not
surprisingly given the strong relationship between partisanship, nationalism, and
voting preferences, these differences decrease considerably in the full model that includes sociodemographic variables and partisan identification. Even net of these
controls, however, creedal nationalists were less likely than other respondents to support Trump over Clinton, at a probability of 0.33. These are sizable differences that
point to the substantive importance of nationalist beliefs in the 2016 election.

Figure 4: Interaction Between Party Identification and Nationalism Predicting Support for Trump over Clinton in the General Election

Primary Elections
We now turn to the two party primaries. The second panels of Figures 2 and 3
present results for the Republican race, comparing Trump support with support for
the moderate candidates (i.e., John Kasich, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio). Compared
to creedal nationalism, adherence to restrictive and ardent nationalism is associated
with greater support for Trump over his moderate rivals (the difference between
restrictive and ardent nationalism is not significant). The average marginal effects
comparing disengagement from the nation to creedal nationalism are positive as
well, but they fail to reach statistical significance. There are no major differences
between the baseline model and a model that includes sociodemographic covariates.
As Figure 3 illustrates, the resulting predicted probabilities range from 0.2 for creedal
nationalists to 0.75 for restrictive nationalists in the base model, and from 0.19 to
0.67 for the same classes, respectively, in the model with sociodemographic controls
(compared to 0.61 in the sample as a whole).
These results provide partial evidence for Hypothesis 3: in a pattern resembling
the difference between Trump and Clinton supporters in the general election, respondents who favored Trump over the moderate Republican candidates in the primary
were more likely to adhere to nationalist beliefs that combined exclusionary criteria
of national membership with either high levels of pride and chauvinism (as in ardent nationalism) or low levels of pride and moderate chauvinism (as in restrictive
nationalism). In contrast, the conventional conceptions of American nationhood invoked by the moderate candidates resonated with those respondents who viewed the
nation in inclusive terms and exhibited high levels of national pride and moderate
46

levels of chauvinism (i.e., creedal nationalists). These distinct configurations of nationalist beliefs served as important factors in Donald Trump’s successful capture of
the Republican Party prior to the 2016 general election.20 Indeed, once nationalist
beliefs are accounted for, few of the standard sociodemographic predictors of voting
preferences reach statistical significance (see Appendix G).
Do these patterns hold when Trump support is compared to support for Ted
Cruz? Given the similarities between the two campaigns’ rhetoric, we hypothesized
that nationalist attitudes would not be an important distinguishing factor between
Trump and Cruz supporters. As the third panel of Figure 2 illustrates, we find
no significant relationships between nationalism and vote choice when comparing
support for these two candidates. Because of the small sample size (N = 141 in the
baseline model) and resulting large standard errors, we hesitate to draw conclusive
inferences from these results. Nonetheless, they do provide suggestive evidence in
favor of Hypothesis 2.
Finally, we turn to our last cross-sectional analysis, comparing Clinton and Sanders
support in the Democratic primary. We predicted that Sanders’ reluctance to engage
with identity-based appeals and with nationalist rhetoric in particular, along with
his populist indictment of the current state of American society, should have made
him more likely than Clinton to draw support from those voters who were disengaged
from the nation (H4). The results are presented in the fourth panels of Figures 2 and
3. Consistent with our expectations, disengagement from the nation is consistently
20

It is important to keep in mind that the dependent variable is based on retrospective accounts of primary voting behavior, so our estimates likely overestimate
Trump support, making our analysis conservative.
47

associated with respondents’ recall of having voted for Sanders over Clinton. Conversely, when compared to disengagement, all three of the remaining configurations
of nationalist beliefs—whether inclusive or exclusionary, proud or unproud, moderately or strongly chauvinistic—appear to have been activated by Clinton’s emphatic
invocation of American nationhood. The probability of a disengaged respondent supporting Clinton over Sanders is 0.32 in the base model and 0.28 in the model with
sociodemographic controls, compared to a sample mean of 0.59. In contrast, restrictive and ardent nationalists favored Clinton over Sanders at a probability greater
than 0.7 in the base model and greater than 0.6 in the full model.21
Taken together, the cross-sectional analyses confirm that nationalism played a
significant role in the 2016 presidential election by way of multiple alternative attitudinal associations. Restrictive and ardent nationalists were more likely than
creedal nationalists to support Trump over moderate candidates in the Republican
primary and over Clinton in the general election, while the disengaged were more
likely than all others to support Sanders over Clinton in the Democratic primary
and more likely than creedals to support Trump over Clinton in the general election.
Most of these associations held when sociodemographic variables—and in the general
election, partisan identity—were included in the models. As demonstrated by the
average marginal effects and predicted probabilities, the observed associations in all
21

Interestingly, we also observe a significant difference between creedal and ardent
nationalism, which had not been anticipated by our hypotheses: respondents who
combined high levels of national pride with exclusionary conceptions of national
membership and strong chauvinism were more likely to support Clinton than Sanders,
even net of sociodemographic controls. It appears that such voters found Sanders’
inclusive and populist rhetoric particularly off-putting.
48

of the above models were substantively large, with some of the classes being less than
half as likely—and others twice more likely—than the sample as a whole to support
a given candidate.

Did Trump Ride a Nativist Wave?
Why was a political outsider wielding xenophobic, Islamophobic, racist, and darkly
populist rhetoric able to capture the Republican Party and the presidency in 2016?
Were the mid-2010s characterized by a sudden surge in conceptions of nationhood
that variously combined ethno-cultural exclusion, low national pride, and chauvinism
across the U.S. population? Or were other temporal trends—such as the partisan
sorting of nationalist beliefs (cf. Baldassarri and Gelman 2008)—more relevant for
explaining nationalism’s increased importance in the 2016 election? These questions
led us to posit two temporal hypotheses: that ardent, restrictive, and disengaged
forms of nationalism have been rising in general prevalence in the United States
(H5) and that ardent, restrictive, and disengaged forms of nationalism have become
increasingly overrepresented among Republicans, while creedal nationalism has become increasingly overrepresented among Democrats (H6). In principle, these two
scenarios could be independent of one another: it is possible that both are true or,
alternatively, that only one is true. While both might also be false, it is unlikely that
the Trump election, which marked a radical change in American politics, emerged
out of a period of absolute stability in public beliefs vis-à-vis the nation.
In testing these predictions, we use cross-sectional data collected in 1996, 2004,
2012, 2014, and 2016 to identify long-term trends in the distribution of the four
49

nationalism types, both in the aggregate and across the two parties.22 The aggregate results are presented in Figure 5. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis
indicates the relative proportion of the nationalism classes—visualized with the four
trend lines—in each survey year.
The patterns in the top panel of Figure 5, which plots the distribution of classes
over time for all respondents, show little evidence of a sudden reshuffling of nationalist
beliefs immediately prior to the 2016 election, as posited by Hypothesis 5. The four
types of nationalism have certainly changed in prevalence over time, but the most
radical shifts occurred not in 2016 but in 2004, following the September 11th attacks,
when creedal nationalism declined to a 20-year low of 0.20 and restrictive nationalism
rose to a 20-year high of 0.42. The second inflection point was 2012, which witnessed
an increase in ardent nationalism to 0.30 and a decrease in disengagement from the
nation to 0.11 (the origins of this shift are less obvious than they are for 2004). In
both cases, the trends largely reverted to the status quo ante in subsequent years.
Moreover, a comparison of 1996 and 2016, the two years bookending our time series,
reveals a high degree of stability, with the 2016 proportions of the four nationalism
types remaining within approximately 5 percentage points of their 1996 levels. The
proportion of restrictive nationalism in the sample did increase by 0.07 between
2014 and 2016, but this was offset by decreases in ardent nationalism (by 0.03) and
disengagement (by 0.05), as well as the continued secular rise of creedal nationalism,

22

Although we have chosen to include the 2014 survey in the analysis, we are
skeptical of its comparability to the other waves of data. In contrast to 1996, 2004,
2012, and 2016, 2014 was not a presidential election year, which likely affected the
distribution and salience of nationalist beliefs in the sample.

which in 2016 reaches its highest level across all fives waves of data (at 0.37). It does
not appear, then, that nationalist beliefs characterized by exclusion, low pride, or
chauvinism surged on the eve of the 2016 election.
The above analysis includes ethnic and racial minorities, who are less likely to
espouse the types of nationalism associated with Trump support. Was the relative
long-term stability of nationalism also present among whites? The bottom panel
in Figure 5 reports the trends for the white subsample. The results are largely
consistent with those for the sample as a whole, with one notable exception: the
2016 increase in restrictive nationalism is more dramatic among white respondents,
reaching a twenty year-peak that exceeds the post-9/11 surge by 0.02. While offset
by a 0.06 decrease in ardent nationalism (and reversion to pre-2014 levels among
the disengaged), this is nevertheless a notable finding. Even if the distribution of
nationalism did not change much between 1996 and 2016 for Americans in general,
white Americans appear to have become more exclusionary and unproud ahead of
the 2016 election. An analysis of the distribution of nationalist beliefs by party, to
which we turn next, will help shed light on the likely source of this pattern.
Despite the finding that in 2016 nationalism in the general population remained
at similar levels to 1996, it is possible that in the ensuing years, the four types of
nationalism became increasingly sorted between the two national parties, as predicted by Hypothesis 6. Figure 6 presents the distribution of nationalist beliefs over
time broken down by partisan identification. These results differ sharply from what
we observed in the sample as a whole: instead of short-term fluctuations around

class-specific means, there is a sharp secular divergence in two of the four types of
nationalism, both within and across the two parties.
The partisan sorting result is clearest among strong Democrats and Republicans.
Whereas in 1996, restrictive nationalism was common among strong Democrats (at 24
percent, just below ardent and creedal nationalism), by 2016 it was the least prevalent
form of nationalism in this group, found only among 13 percent of strong Democratic
partisans. Similarly, ardent nationalism decreased in this group from 34 percent to
23 percent. Over the same time period, in contrast, creedal nationalism increased
dramatically among strong Democrats, from 26 percent in 1996 to 50 percent in 2016.
Among strong Republicans, the opposite was true: restrictive nationalism increased
between 1996 and 2016 from 26 to 52 percent, while creedal nationalism declined
precipitously, from 44 to 10 percent. Ardent nationalism remained more stable,
declining by a mere 4 points from 29 to 25 percent. Interestingly disengagement,
which had been largely absent among strong Republicans from 1996 to 2014, surged
in 2016 to 13 percent of the sample.
Similar, though somewhat more muted, patterns are present among less strongly
committed Democratic and Republican partisans: an increase in creedal nationalism
(from 30 to 58 percent) and decrease in restrictive nationalism (from 31 to 17 percent)
among Democrats and an increase in restrictive nationalism (from 29 to 46 percent)
and a decrease in creedal nationalism (from 35 to 26 percent) among Republicans.23

23

The temporal patterns among Independents, for whom we did not formulate
hypotheses, are far more stable than among Democratic and Republican partisans,
with all four nationalist classes in 2016 remaining within 2 percentage points of their
1996 levels.
54

What these results clearly reveal is that nationalism has become increasingly
sorted by party in the United States. In 1996, it would have been difficult to predict a respondent’s partisan identity based on his or her nationalist beliefs (and vice
versa), whereas by 2016, partisanship and nationalism had become tightly coupled:
Republicans had become predominantly restrictive and Democrats had become overwhelmingly committed to creedal nationalism. These findings also help explain the
increased prevalence of the restrictive class in the white sample: this form of nationalism had been on a secular rise—briefly interrupted by a downturn in 2014 (a
year without a presidential election)—among Republicans, whose ranks have been
increasingly dominated by white voters (Mason and Wronski 2018).24
To more formally capture the partisan sorting process, we calculated the difference between the Republican and Democratic share of each nationalist class for
each year. The results broken down by nationalism type are presented in Figures 7,
whereas the aggregate association of nationalism with party over time (an arithmetic
sum of party-class differences) is illustrated in Figure 8.
Consistent with the patterns observed in Figure 6, the association between restrictive and creedal nationalism and partisan identification increases dramatically
over the span of our data. In 1996, the difference between the Republican and Democratic shares of creedal nationalism was 8 percentage points; by 2016, the share of
Democratic creedal nationalists exceeded that of their Republican counterparts by
34 points. The change among restrictive nationalists was even more dramatic, with
the party gap growing from a single percentage point in 1996 to 33 points by 2016.

No comparable pattern is observed among the disengaged or ardent nationalists: the
difference in the parties’ share of these classes grew in 2004, but it reverted to near
its 1996 levels by 2016, with disengagement remaining somewhat over-represented
among Democrats and restrictive nationalism among Democrats.
There are two other features of the Figure 6 results worth noting. First, 2014
continues to stand out as an unusual year. As was the case in the aggregate and
party-specific figures, the distribution of nationalism types in the 2014 GSS reflects a
sharp but short-lived departure from the secular changes unfolding between 2004 and
2016. It is difficult to tell if this is an artifact of that specific survey or a period effect
associated with 2014 not being a presidential election year, in contrast to the other
four waves of data in our study. Either way, we remain cautious in interpreting the
unusual patterns observed in that survey. Second, 2014 aside, the partisan sorting
observed in 2016 did not begin in that year; instead, it was a culmination of a
longer-term trend first observed in 2012, but likely commencing sometime between
the 2004 and 2012 wave. Explaining the causes of polarization is beyond the scope
of our paper, but its timing in our data is consistent with past research that sees the
Trump election as in part a consequence of the Republican Party’s active and racially
charged vilification and delegitimization of the Obama presidency (Tesler 2016).25
The partisan sorting trends are further confirmed in Figure 8, which illustrates
25

The partisan sorting of nationalism appears to have been disproportionately influenced by attitudinal shifts among non-whites. As Appendix D demonstrates, the
prevalence of the four nationalism classes changed especially dramatically among
African Americans, who overwhelmingly support the Democratic Party. Restrictive nationalism decreased steadily between 1996 and 2016 among this demographic,
while creedal nationalism surged over the same time period.

the aggregate differences between the party-specific shares of all four nationalism
classes. The figure provides an additional piece of information, however, regarding
the timing of the partisan sorting trend. While the creedal and restrictive classes became strongly associated with the Democratic and Republican Parties, respectively,
beginning in 2012, the sorting of nationalist beliefs in general began as early as 2004—
in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq—and remained at a high level through 2016 (here too 2014 marks a short-term
deviation from the overall trend). The 2004 party differences are driven primarily
by a rise in ardent and restrictive nationalism and a drop in creedal nationalism and
disengagement among Republicans, as well as an increase in disengagement and restrictive nationalism and a drop in ardent and creedal nationalism among Democrats.
Whereas among Democrats these changes were fleeting and reverted back to baseline
by 2012, restrictive and ardent nationalism continued to dominate the Republican
Party through 2016.
Together, the temporal results demonstrate that by 2016, Democrats and Republicans were sharply divided in their understanding of the nation, with Republican
overwhelmingly favoring ardent and restrictive nationalism (at a combined 71 percent) and Democrats adhering to creedal nationalism (at 54 percent). This was not
a sudden change, however, but one that had been gradually building over the prior
decade and a half, likely beginning with a reaction to the September 11 attacks and
U.S. military engagements abroad and further intensifying as a consequence of the
Republican Party’s stoking of racial resentment and dissatisfaction with the nation’s
trajectory among its mostly white supporters during the Obama years. It appears

59

then that Donald Trump did not catalyze a major shift in the political relevance of
American nationalism, but rather capitalized on a demand for a politics of exclusion, populism, and discontent that had long been growing among Republican voters.
Indeed, if there was a single watershed in the recent history of American popular
nationalism, it was the George W. Bush presidency, which preceded the Trump campaign by over a decade. It was during this period that the two parties first set off
on sharply divergent nationalist trajectories (Jacobson 2008).

Discussion and Conclusion
This study has used a unique combination of existing and original survey data to examine the relationship between multiple forms of American nationalism and voting
preferences in the 2016 presidential election. Our cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that multiple configurations of nationalist beliefs that variously combined
exclusionary definitions of legitimate national membership, low levels of pride, and
chauvinism provided a crucial base of support for Donald Trump, both during the
Republican primary and the general election. The latter results held even once partisan identification—the strongest predictor of vote choice—was taken into account.
The relevance of nationalism, however, was not limited to the general-election contest between Trump and Clinton. Ardent and restrictive nationalism were also highly
predictive of support for Trump over his moderate opponents in the Republican primary, whereas disengagement from the nation was associated with a preference for
Sanders over Clinton in the Democratic primary.

60

As our longitudinal analysis demonstrates, the importance of nationalism in the
2016 election did not result from a sudden surge in the types of nationalism associated with Trump support. On the contrary, popular conceptions of nationhood, on
average, were quite stable between 1996 and 2016 (though 2004 and 2012 marked
temporary deviations from this trend). This does not imply, however, that public
opinion trends were irrelevant for Donald Trump’s success. What our analysis reveals
is that over the same time period, Americans’ nationalist beliefs became increasingly
mapped onto their partisan identities. By 2016, most Republicans adhered to restrictive or ardent nationalism, while most Democrats espoused creedal nationalist
beliefs. The sorting of nationalism by party represents a marked difference from
the configuration of nationalist beliefs in 1996, the first wave of our data, when
nationalist cleavages were largely cross-cutting across parties.
In identifying these empirical patterns, this study makes five primary contributions to the sociology and political science literature on radical politics and nationalism. First, it sets aside the vague category of “cultural” sources of radical-right
support and offers a more theoretically precise and empirically grounded framework for understanding the common source of antipathy toward both native- and
foreign-born ethnic, racial, and religious minorities, which is combined in various
configurations with negative evaluations of the nation, skepticism toward established
institutions and elites, and a belief in the superiority of the United States to other
countries. These seemingly disparate sentiments are rooted in fundamental beliefs
about the meaning of one’s own national identity. Sharp distinctions in collective
self-understanding constitute cultural cleavages in a national population that may

61

be latent much of the time, but under particular circumstances can guide people’s
political decisions. The 2016 presidential election was clearly one such moment. In
addition to a variety of structural changes that may have increased the resonance
of distinct nationalist appeals, the partisan sorting of—but not aggregate reshuffling
of—nationalist beliefs appears to have been an important contributing factor.
Second, by relating the discursive strategies of the various campaigns in the 2016
election to the cultural schemas held by voters, the paper draws attention to the importance of bringing together the supply and demand sides of politics. Our reading
of the election media coverage, combined with the supplementary computational text
analysis of campaign speeches (Appendix F), enabled us to posit a series of hypotheses about the likely sources of support for the various candidates. As our analyses
reveal, in 2016, when identity concerns appear to have been highly salient, campaigns’ decisions to rely on a particular forms of nationalist appeals—or to sidestep
nationalism altogether—had important implications for respondents’ evaluations of
the candidates. While the ultimate outcomes of the primary and general elections
were likely a function of a host of causal factors, both institutional and symbolic,
the relative resonance of various forms of nationalist claims-making appear to have
played an important role in the process.
Third, we have demonstrated that nationalism represents yet another belief domain that has become increasingly sorted by party in the recent decades. Given the
cultural importance of nationalist beliefs, we view this trend as particularly concerning. Cultural schemas of the nation are not isolated social attitudes or policy preferences; they are master frames that organize people’s collective self-understanding,

62

shape their disposition toward other groups, affect their evaluation of the nation’s
past and future trajectories, and impact the structure and content of interpersonal
interactions (cf. Hetherington and Weiler 2009). When cultural rifts between alternative understandings of nationhood become mutually reinforcing with other sociodemographic and political cleavages, they are likely to further contribute to the erosion
of social solidarity and democratic consensus-building, with potentially deleterious
consequences for long-term political stability. To put things more concretely, the
fact that one of the two national parties has become a party of ethnoracial exclusion,
nationalist discontent, and chauvinism is unlikely to produce a stable democratic
equilibrium, particularly in the context of rapidly rising elite polarization, mass negative partisanship, and growing demographic diversity.
Fourth, our temporal analysis demonstrates that the partisan sorting of nationalist beliefs did not occur in the immediate prelude to the 2016 election. On the
contrary, it was a product of a long-term process that appears to have begun in
the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and to have become further exacerbated as a result of the Republican Party’s racialized and democratically corrosive
attacks on the Obama presidency. This suggests that symbolic crises may be more
important in producing changes in nationalist beliefs than structural shocks, such as
the Great Recession. Although the George W. Bush administration sought to unite
the nation after 9/11 and prevent the tragedy from generating excessive inter-group
tensions, the choice to treat the event as an unprecedented national security crisis
rather than a crime (Feinstein 2016b; Jacobson 2008), the concomitant radicalization
of political discourse related to Islam and Muslims (Bail 2014), and the subsequent

63

doubling down of Republican political elites on white identity politics (Bonikowski
2019; Jardina 2019; Tesler 2016) appear to have had long-term consequences.
In light of these trends, it makes more sense to view the Trump campaign and
presidency as products of underlying crescive changes in U.S. political culture, rather
than as causes in themselves of the country’s turn toward right-wing radicalism. Over
the past decade and a half, the demand for radical-right politics, characterized by
ethnoracial exclusion, moral critique of political elites, and nostalgia for the nation’s
putative past glory, has been steadily growing among Republicans, whose ranks are
dominated by white Americans. This trend helps explain Republican voters’ support
for Sarah Palin vice presidential candidacy in the 2008 election and for the Tea Party’s
public protests and electoral activism in the early 2010s (Parker and Barreto 2014).
Neither of these political projects, however, was able to give voice to, empower, and
mobilize the growing ardent- and restrictive-nationalist Republican voting block with
the same degree of efficacy as Donald Trump. It is in part by skillfully articulating
and amplifying the nationalist grievances of a growing majority of Republicans that
Trump was able to capture the Republican Party and ultimately the presidency.
Finally, this paper demonstrates the value of bridging the divide between political science and sociology in the study of radical politics. By synthesizing insights on
the conceptualization and measurement of belief structures from cultural sociology
and the role of conflicting nationhood schemas from the nationalism literature with
the focal subject matter of comparative party politics scholarship, we have sought
to make contributions to both disciplines. We hope that our work will inspire political sociologists to continue their re-engagement with the study of institutional

64

politics, while prompting political scientists to take culture more seriously in their
research on electoral outcomes. The areas of commonality between these historically
related fields are expanding and our work is both inspired by and seeks to fuel the
continued cross-pollination of ideas between them. The value of such engagement is
not purely academic: the dangers posed to the future of liberal democracy by the
rise of radical politics demand rigorous, multicausal analyses that transcend disciplinary constraints. It is our view that nationalism—clearly theorized and precisely
measured—belongs at the center of such analyses.
One limitation of our study is that it is necessarily correlational rather than
causal, because of the unavailability of panel data on nationalist beliefs. As a result, our analyses effectively treat political discourse and attitudes as exogenous and
stable during the 2016 election. Of course, this is a simplification of how politics
actually works. In reality, candidates engage in extensive public opinion polling,
experiment with a variety of campaign frames, and adjust their messaging based
on audience reactions (the latter was especially true of Donald Trump’s haphazard
but effective approach to campaigning, which relied on real-time crowd feedback at
mass rallies [McVeigh and Estep 2019]). Nationalist beliefs in the electorate are also
likely to be activated—and perhaps even altered—depending on the specific frames
chosen by candidates and amplified by the media. Although we are unable to model
these recursive processes directly, they are broadly consistent with our theoretical
framework, which assumes that latent cultural cleavages are potentially mobilizable
by the right type of political discourse in the right structural conditions (McDonnell
et al. 2017). At the same time, the fact that the aggregate attitudinal stability and

65

partisan polarization we observe in our data had preceded the 2016 election suggests
that Donald Trump’s campaign did not in itself generate a sudden nationalist upsurge in the American public. On the contrary, the necessary (but not sufficient)
conditions for a takeover of the Republican party by its radical wing had been in the
making for a decade and a half prior.
Our theoretical model and empirical results suggest, therefore, that the key
question facing scholars of contemporary radical politics is not whether nationalist campaign discourse generates attitudinal change or vice versa, but rather, why
nationalism, which has long been a feature of political culture in most democracies,
has become especially salient in recent years. A conclusive answer to this question
is beyond the scope of this paper, but what seems clear is that existing explanations invoking structural factors common across countries (e.g., growing economic
inequality, trade shocks, economic crises, demographic change, labor union decline)
and country-specific contingent events (e.g., racial backlash against President Barack
Obama in the U.S., the nationalist framing of the Smolensk plane crash by the PiS
party in Poland) should be supplemented by greater attention to the long-term realignment of nationalist beliefs among the public. In the United States, this trend
had generated growing demand for radical-right politics among a large subset of
white Americans, whose votes were then captured by an opportunistic politician relying on a persuasive combination of exclusionary, populist, and dystopian political
claims. Whether these mechanisms have proximate parallels in other contemporary
democracies that have faced a radical-right upsurge is a matter for future research.

Comparison of Latent Class Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis Results

Our choice of discrete over continuous latent models, such as confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA), is driven by the widely accepted insight in sociology that culture is
inherently relational. As is the case in other domains, nationalist beliefs are arranged
in overarching configurations (or schemas), whereby the meaning of any individual
attitude depends on its relationship to the other attitudes. Latent class analysis is
well suited to measuring such configurations, because it is able to identify distinct
response patterns across a large number of variables within a sample of respondents.
This assumes, however, that the variation in the resulting attitudinal configurations
is discrete—that is, that it captures differences of kind rather than degree. An
alternative approach would be to identify latent continuous dimensions underlying
the nationalism survey data. This would preserve more information in the model,
since discretization necessarily sacrifices some variation, and allow for the estimation
of net associations between the latent dimensions and outcomes of interest in a
multivariate framework.
Although we deliberately chose not to use the latter approach in our study—
because it cannot capture complex interactions between nationalism variables and
prioritizes net associations instead of multiple cultural pathways to a given outcome—
we employ it in this appendix for the purposes of comparison. In our view, the
results generated by CFA as less compelling than those generate by LCA, but we
nonetheless see them as substantively useful—they offer a complementary way to
examine our data and reveal some reassuringly consistent patterns with our main
findings. We focus here specifically on three latent factors: pride, chauvinism, and
inclusion/exclusion. These are merely a starting point for comparing the two approaches; a complete CFA analysis would likely require more numerous factors to
distinguish pride in national achievements from pride in institutions and account for
the fact that exclusionary definitions of national boundaries often co-occur within
individuals with elective criteria of membership.
Foreshadowing our later regression results using LCA, Figure B1 illustrates the
bivariate and multi-variable relationships between the three continuous factors and
candidate support in the 2016 primary and general elections. Inclusion/exclusion,
pride, and chauvinism were all significantly associated with voting preferences. This
confirms that a wide range of nationalist beliefs—and not just criteria of legitimate
national membership—matter for political behavior, as we have argued in the paper.
The differences between the bivariate and multi-variable results are the most striking
for the pride dimension, which flips signs in the general election model and becomes

Figure B2: Associations Between Continuous Latent Factors and Candidate Support
in Primary and General Elections, Interaction Models
Figure B2, which illustrates the results of the above regression models with interactions introduced between the nationalism factors, further supports our argument
about the combinatorial nature of nationalist beliefs. Many of the two-way interactions are significantly associated with vote preference. For instance, exclusionary
beliefs combined with low pride predict Trump support, whereas combined with high
pride predict Clinton support. The overall patterns, however, are difficult to inter88

pret, because of the general complexity of two-way interactions and the fact that
not all combinations of variables are likely to be well represented in the data. What
is more, to fully capture the various configurations of nationalist beliefs, we would
need to model three-way interactions, which would further increase the interpretive
burden associated with the models. If we introduced additional continuous factors
to distinguish types of pride or further complicated the measurement of conceptions
of legitimate national membership, the models would become completely unwieldy,
requiring four- or five-way interactions.
Latent class analysis solves these problems in a robust and parsimonious manner.
It inductively emphasizes regions of the complex interaction space between the 23
nationalism indicators that are observed with high frequency in the data and uses
this information to identify distinct configurations of beliefs. By classifying respondents based on their adherence to these attitudinal configurations, it makes possible
downstream analyses of the sociodemographic covariates of latent class membership
(in our case, party identification) and the associations between the latent classes and
other phenomena of interest (in our case, voting preferences). None of this would be
straightforward with a continuous latent approach, like confirmatory factor analysis.
To demonstrate the relationship between the CFA and LCA results, we map
membership in the latent classes (coded by color) onto an interaction space between
the three CFA factors, as illustrated in Figure B3. Consistent with our arguments,
latent class membership is highly localized in the three-factor space, capturing those
aspects of the three-way interaction that are most prevalent in the data. With a fouror five-way factor interaction, the precision of our LCA results would likely be even
more noticeable, though visualizing such complex interactions would be a challenge.

Latent Class Analysis Model Selection

Model selection in latent class analysis is typically guided by statistical goodnessof-fit measures and interpretability. Accordingly, we ran multiple models with a
single latent categorical variable and varying number of classes (i.e., latent variable
categories), while also adding to some models direct effects that relaxed assumptions
about the local independence of specific pairs of indicators (these were successively
added in descending order of their model residuals until further additions yielded no
further improvement in model fit). All the models included standard survey weights,
which were rescaled to ensure that each wave of data (i.e., 1996, 2004, 2012, 2014, and
2016) contributed equally to the solution. The goodness-of-fit statistics are provided
in Table C1 below. The four-class model with eleven direct effects yielded the lowest
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Moreover, adding a fifth class did not add
significant new information to the results from the four-class model: the fifth class
represented a small variation on the existing four classes.

To minimize the effects of year-specific measurement error on the overall LCA
solution, we estimated the latent classes using a fully heterogeneous model, which
allows not only the prevalence of classes but also the conditional probabilities of
nationalist item responses (i.e., the class content) to vary from year to year. Although
this makes the classes more closely reflective of the data in each survey year, it raises
the question of how comparable the classes are across years. Figure C1 presents
the class-specific means of the nationalism indicators for the five waves of data.
Overall, the response patterns look very similar over time, reassuring us that we
have identified the same four classes in all five years. To the degree that there are
year-specific deviations from the overall pattern, they are primarily concentrated in
the 2004 and 2014 GSS. The former survey was administered within two years of 9/11,
when nationalist beliefs were likely to be particularly intense, whereas the latter was
the only wave of data in our study to not be fielded during a presidential election
year. In both cases, minor deviations are to be expected and the fully heterogeneous
model ensures that they do not skew the results for the remaining years. Even with
those deviations taken into account, however, the classes remain substantively similar
over time, which increases our confidence in our over-time comparisons.

The numbers in Table D1 average over the five waves of data. To get a better
sense of how nationalist beliefs changed over time across racial categories—a question that is of particular importance for understanding the sources of the partisan
sorting of nationalism—we also plotted the prevalence of the four classes by year
and race. As Figure D1 illustrates, the most dramatic changes occurred among
African Americans. In 2004, restrictive nationalism and disengagement were significantly overrepresented among African Americans (cf. Bonikowski and DiMaggio
2016). By 2012, however, creedal nationalism became the second most prevalent
form of nationalism among African Americans (presumably partly in reaction to the
Obama presidency), while the prevalence of restrictive began to wane among this
group. This trend continued through 2016, so that by the end of the time series,
creedal nationalism was by far the most prevalent class among African Americans
(at 52 percent) whereas restrictive nationalism decreased to a mere 14 percent, the
second least prevalent class among this group, following ardent nationalism (at 13
percent). Given African Americans’ dominant affiliation with the Democratic Party,
these marked distributional changes most likely contributed the overall sorting of
nationalism across Democrats and Republicans.

The patterns among Latinos are less pronounced, but they also demonstrate considerable temporal change. Creedal nationalism, which had declined precipitously
among this group after 9/11, increased to its highest levels by 2012 and remained
stable through 2014 and 2016. Conversely, disengagement has been steadily decreasing between 1996 and 2016, from 34 to 16 percent, respectively. Interestingly, ardent
nationalism has increased among this group from a low of 11 percent in 1996 to 33 in
2016. Latinos are predominantly affiliated with the Democratic Party, so the growing numbers of creedal nationalists among them likely contributed to the partisan
sorting we have observed in the aggregate trends. This may have been somewhat
offset, however, by the rise in ardent nationalism among this group.
The residual “other” racial category is too heterogeneous and small to warrant
extensive interpretation, but its overall pattern of change bears some resemblance to
African Americans, with a surge in creedal nationalism—the prevalence of which is
the highest in this subsample—and a decline in restrictive nationalism.

98

E

Justification for Using Ascriptive Criteria of National Belonging as Measures of Broad-Based
Exclusion

We argue that high scores on ascriptive criteria of national membership in our survey
data (i.e., the importance of birth and lifelong residence in the United States and of
Christian religion for being a “true” American) are indicative of broadly exclusionary conceptions of national symbolic boundaries—that is, they serve as a common
denominator of a wide range of out-group antipathies, including xenophobia but also
racism, Islamophobia, and negative sentiments toward other ethnic and religious minority groups. One could question this interpretation based on the observation that
the survey items in our analysis could in fact be capturing a more specific antipathy
toward recent immigrants (i.e., those who were not born in the country or have not
resided in the country for a long time), independent of their race, ethnicity, or religion. If so, the out-group antipathies measured by these variables may not extend
to long-established U.S. minority groups, such as African Americans or native-born
Latinos. While reasonable, this critique is inconsistent with the existing literature
on nationalism, past research using the same measures, and additional analyses we
conducted to examine the associations between the four types of nationalism identified in our data and measures of racial attitudes. We review each of these sources of
evidence in turn.
First, the binary categories of ethnic and civic nationalism are well established in
the nationalism literature, dating back to Hans Kohn’s (1944) classic work, but also
to its antecedents, such as the writing of Johann Herder in the 18th century (Herder
2004) and Friedrich Meinecke at the turn of the 20th century (Meinecke 2015). One of
the more influential contemporary treatments of this two-fold classification is Rogers
Brubaker’s (2009) highly cited book on German and French nationalism. In this tradition, the distinction between ethnic and civic nationalism rests on whether national
membership is based on ascriptive or elective criteria, respectively. In countries that
(or among individuals who) adhere to civic nationalism, being a member of a nation is a matter of choice: as long as a person feels an affinity toward the nation,
respects its institutions, and follows a legal path to residency or citizenship, they are
seen as fully legitimate co-nationals. Conversely, in countries that (or among people who) adhere to ethnic nationalism, national membership is a matter of (largely)
immutable traits, such as race, ancestry, religion, and yes, native birth and lifelong
residence in the country. In this perspective, no matter how hard someone desires to
become a member of the nation, if they do not possess the “right” traits, they will
99

never truly belong. Thus, in interpreting affirmative responses to survey questions
about ascriptive criteria of national membership as indicative of general ethnoracial
exclusion rather than merely xenophobia, we employ an approach consistent with
an extensively theorized conceptual distinction that is central to the nationalism
literature.
Consistent with this theoretical approach, empirical research on nationalism has
demonstrated that ascriptive conceptions of national belonging are associated with
broad-based exclusion (e.g., Devos and Banaji 2005; Kaufmann 2000; Kinder and
Kam 2010; Schildkraut 2010). This conclusion is reinforced by two findings from
studies using similar survey items and data to those featured in our paper: native
birth, lifelong residence, and religious criteria are highly correlated with one another and with other measures of exclusion (such as those based on ancestry or race)
(Kunovich 2009; Simonsen and Bonikowski 2019); and the same measures are highly
predictive not only of anti-immigrant attitudes, but also of racial resentment, opposition to policies that redress historical injustices toward long-established minorities
(such as African Americans and Latinos in the United States), economic redistribution toward minority groups, and religious exclusion (Bonikowski and DiMaggio
2016; Simonsen and Bonikowski 2019).
To assess whether the same patterns of association are found in our data, we
conducted a series of supplementary analyses. As a first step, we made use of an
additional variable that was included in our 2016 survey but not in our main analyses:
the importance of ancestry for national membership (we had initially excluded it in
the interest of cross-year comparability, because it had not been administered in all
the waves of data). The perceived importance of ancestry is highly correlated in
2016 with the importance of birth (r = 0.69) and lifelong residence (r = 0.6) in the
country, as well as with the importance of Christianity (r = 0.6). Moreover, including
ancestry in the LCA models does not substantively alter our results (e.g., see the
general election prediction results in Figure E1). Consistent with past research,
these results suggest that all four ascriptive criteria of national membership are part
of a single attitudinal complex. By endorsing ancestry as well as native birth as
prerequisites for full national membership, respondents are de facto excluding not
only recent immigrants, but also second-generation Americans (at the very least)
from being truly American.
The actual meaning of endorsing these barriers to full membership, however, is in
fact even more invidious. As we illustrate in Figures E2 and E3, white respondents’
membership in nationalism classes characterized by ascriptive criteria of national
membership is predictive of lower values on feeling thermometers toward African
Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Muslims (compared to whites), as well

as a greater tendency to feel that whites receive less respect than African Americans and Latinos. These are the only proxy measures for racial resentment available
to us, but these results tell a similar story to that shown in other research: when
white respondents define “real” Americans in ascriptive terms—whether through the
importance of native birth, lifelong residence in the country, ancestry, or Christianity—what they actually mean is that white Christians have privileged access to (if
not a monopoly on) legitimate national belonging. Taken together, these results
reassure us that we are indeed measuring a general tendency toward minority group
exclusion, and not just anti-immigrant sentiment.

Campaign Speech Analysis

To gain a better understanding of the nationalist frames used by the presidential
candidates in the 2016 primary and general elections, we carried out an analysis
of all available campaign speeches using word embeddings models (Mikolov et al.
2013; Kozlowski et al. 2019. One of the many affordances of this method is that it
allows for the visualization of a word’s meaning in a given corpus (assuming that
meaning emerges out of the relations of similarity and difference between symbols
[Mohr 1998]). We take advantage of this feature to compare the meanings of key
words across the campaign-specific text corpora. These results inform our subsequent
hypotheses about the relationship between campaign content and nationalist beliefs.
The counts of the candidates’ speeches are summarized in Table F1.
To highlight differences in the campaigns’ rhetoric, we focus on the candidatespecific meanings of two terms: ‘dangerous’ and ‘politics.’ The former term identifies
what the candidate views as the most pressing concerns facing the country (e.g., terrorism, immigration, partisan polarization) and, given the word’s potency, is likely
to elicit morally charged content typical of nationalist discourse.26 The second focal term of the embeddings analysis—‘politics’—reveals whether or not a candidate

Our choice of this term is additionally informed by the likelihood that candidates
invoking exclusionary conceptions of national membership are less likely to make affirmative statements about what the nation is (e.g., “America is a white nation”)
than negative statements about what the nation is not (e.g., “Americans should be
protected from immigrants and Muslims”). By examining meanings contained in
such negative statements, as reflected by terms co-occurring with the word ‘dangerous,’ we can gain a better understanding of how candidates define the boundaries of
legitimate nationhood.

frames the political establishment in morally negative terms typical of populist discourse (Hawkins 2009). Such anti-elite appeals may activate varieties of nationalism
that score low on institutional pride.27 Taken together, the embeddings analyses of
the candidates’ conceptualizations of national boundaries and of political institutions
allow us to capture the specific type of nationalism on which each candidate relied
in the 2016 election.
Figures F1 and F2 illustrate the discursive content of the general and primary
campaigns, respectively.28 In addition to visualizing the vector-space neighborhoods
of the two key terms, the figures highlight terms that are of particular interest for
differentiating the candidates’ use of nationalist appeals. In the the left-hand panels
of Figures F1 and F2, we focus on nouns and adjectives that describe the sources of
danger to the country. In the right-hand panels, we hone in on nouns and adjectives
that capture the speaker’s characterization of the field of politics. In both cases,
negative words are shaded in dark gray; in the figures for ‘politics,’ positive words
are additionally shaded in light gray.29
The results of the word embedding analysis are broadly consistent with our characterization of the campaigns based on media sources. Donald Trump’s discourse
stands out in its alarmist conflation of ‘aliens’ and ‘refugees’ with ‘gangs,’ ‘cartels,’
‘syndicates,’ ‘terror[ists],’ ‘traffickers,’ and other ‘radical’ and ‘criminal’ actors, thus
depicting America as a nation in ‘turmoil’ invaded by dangerous outsiders, who are
27

Whether populist claims mobilize specifically populist attitudes or help activate
other beliefs, including those related to nationalism, is a topic of active debate in the
political science literature (e.g., Akkerman et al. 2014; Castanho Silva et al. 2019;
Rooduijn 2019). Weighing in on this debate is outside of the scope of this paper;
instead, we simply note that individuals with low levels of pride in the nation and
the state may be particularly responsive to political claims that depict the nation
as having lost its way due to the self-interested actions of morally corrupt political,
economic, or cultural elites.
28
Due to the small number of speeches by moderate Republican primary candidates, we group them into a single corpus, visualized in Figure F2. Only three
speeches were available for Ted Cruz, so we exclude his campaign from the word embedding analysis. A close reading of these documents, however, supports our earlier
description of the Cruz campaign as similarly exclusionary and anti-establishment
to Trump’s rhetoric (though the former featured stronger appeals to Evangelical
Christians); we illustrate these conclusions with selected quotes from Cruz below.
29
Given the relatively small number of words in the figure, we rely on hand coding
instead of more complex (and potentially more error-prone) automated methods, like
part-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis.

‘pour[ing]’ over the borders. This is combined with an acrimonious view of politics (Figure F1b) as characterized by the ‘elitism,’ ‘cynicism,’ and ‘hypocrisy’ of the
‘corrupt,’ ‘bitter,’ and ‘arrogant’ ‘entrenched’ ‘establishment,’ whose ‘failures’ have
betrayed the people.
Clinton’s claims about the problems facing America are starkly different. Rather
than identifying specific groups of people and their allegedly threatening deeds, she
focuses on the dangers posed by ‘reckless’ and ‘divisive’ ‘bullying,’ ‘harassment,’ and
‘discrimination.’30 Her view of politics (Figure F1d) is largely positive, as indicated
by terms such as ‘inclusive,’ ‘unifying,’ ‘respect,’ and ‘participate.’ To the degree
that there are problems with politics, they are due to ‘partisanship’ and ‘cynical’
‘fear’ ‘mongering,’ not any fundamental attribute of the elites.
Whereas the Republican moderates are generally similar in their depictions of
danger and politics to Clinton, the same cannot be said of Sanders (Figure F2). In
contrast to Trump, Sanders’ conceptions of danger lack references to immigrants or
minorities and instead focus on geopolitical and economic risks associated with specific countries.31 His populist depiction of politics, however, shares the critical tone
observed in Trump’s discourse, though Sanders was more focused on the influence of
money on democratic representation. In particular, he described the ‘establishment’
as having been ‘bought’ and ‘corrupted’ by ‘billionaires’ and the ‘rich,’ a ‘tragic’
situation that disadvantages those who are ‘struggling.’
Finally, a close reading of Ted Cruz’s speeches (which were too few to include
in the computational analysis) reveals patterns similar to those observed for Trump.
Cruz repeatedly makes reference to ‘the evil of Islamists and ISIS,’ ‘radical Islamic
terrorism’ and (in reference to Hamas) ‘terrorist monsters’ ‘that celebrate the murder
of women and children,’ while presenting himself as an ‘outsider’ who can aid ‘towns
and faces [...] weathered with trouble, joblessness, and fear.’ He claims to be free of
the influence of ‘bundlers and special interests’ and instead to draw ‘fuel [...] directly
from the people,’ in sharp contrast to the Obama administration that ‘led to more
elitist control from Washington [and] [l]ess freedom for the People.’
The data for the analysis of campaign speeches were obtained from two online
30

One term seemingly at odds with this interpretation is ‘Mexican,’ but a close
reading of Clinton’s speeches reveals that this word was used solely in critiques of
Trump’s xenophobic discourse.
31
A close readings of Sanders’ speeches suggests that he referred to Britain, Ireland, Japan, Sweden, and Argentina as exemplars of progressive social and economic
policies that could be adopted in the United States to address rising inequality. His
references to Saudi Arabia were more critical: he argued that the country should do
more to help the United States battle ISIS.

sources: Factba.se, a database of all public statements made by Donald Trump over
his lifetime, and the American Presidency Project at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, a compendium of political statements by prominent U.S. politicians,
which we used a source of Hillary Clinton’s, Bernie Sanders’, Ted Cruz’s, and the
moderate Republican candidates’ (i.e., John Kasich’s, Jeb Bush’s, and Marco Rubio’s) campaign discourse. We limited the corpus to speeches delivered during the
2016 primary and general elections, beginning with each candidate’s presidential run
announcement and ending with his or her concession speech (for Trump and Clinton,
we focus specifically on the general election, from the Republican and Democratic
National Conventions to Election Day). After scraping and cleaning the speech transcripts, we used a word embedding model (specifically word2vec) and tensorflow
visualization to examine differences between the campaigns in the meaning of key
terms relevant to our research question. Data collection and analysis were performed
in Python using a variety of web scraping and text analysis packages, including
scrapy and gensim.
Word embedding models use shallow neural networks to arrive at a representation
of each word in a corpus as a dense k-dimensional vector, such that distance between
words in the resulting k-dimensional space is indicative of the proximity of the words
to one another in the corpus (the algorithm arrives at the solution by predicting the
probability of each word’s occurrence given the co-presence of its neighboring words)
(Mikolov et al. 2013). We selected a 50-dimensional vector space for representing the
terms in the campaign speeches. This space was reduced to two dimensions using a
tensorflow algorithm in order to visualize the word relationships in Figures F1 and
F2 (importantly, the orientation and scale of the axes are not meaningful).

Comparison of Race and Nationalism as Predictors of General-Election Voting Preferences

To better understand the relationship between race and nationalism as predictors
of support for Trump over Clinton in the 2016 general election, we performed a
mediation analysis of these two sets of variables (both for the mediation of nationalism by race and vice versa) (Mize et al. 2019). The results are presented in Figure
H1. Adding race to models containing nationalist class membership and sociodemographic controls has only a modest impact on the predicted probabilities of Trump
support based on the nationalist items. The differences between models are not significant for creedal and ardent nationalists, whereas the inclusion of race modestly
increases the predicted probability for disengagement and decreases that for restrictive nationalism (at p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Conversely, the addition of
nationalism items to models containing race and controls has no significant impact
on any of the race coefficients. The addition of partisan identification to the models reduces the modest mediation effect of nationalism by race to non-significance,
whereas in the case of the mediation of race by nationalism, it results in a small
but significant mediation of the residual ”other” racial category by the nationalism
items. Together, these results demonstrate that the mediation between race and
nationalism is modest at best, reinforcing the conclusion from Appendix G that the
two variables have independent and direct associations with general-election voting
preferences.

General Social Survey, a 2012 GfK Custom Research KnowledgePanel survey, and a 2016
YouGov online panel survey.

Table I1 reports the number of observations with missing data on any of the
nationalism indicators or the partisan identification variable by survey year. The
1996, 2004, and 2014 GSS surveys have a particularly high rate of missingness for
the nationalism items, averaging 3.44 percent of the sample per survey item across
the three waves (compared to 0.91 per survey item across the two non-GSS surveys).
Because we use listwise deletion in our main analyses for observations with missing
values on any variable, our sample is consequently reduced by 1,500 observations
across the five waves in the trend analysis (i.e., 20.55 percent of the pooled sample),
while missing values for the party identification variable reduce the 2016 regression
samples by up to another 129 observations. To determine whether our results are
sensitive to exclusion of the observations with missing data, we retained those cases
using two methods. First, we allowed the LCA models to include observations with
missing nationalism responses, so that the estimation was based on all the available
information in the data. Second, we used multiple imputation to deal with missing
values on party identification (missingness was not an issue for any of the other
125

sociodemographic covariates). We then compared the regression and partisan sorting
results between the sample reduced through listwise deletion and the complete sample
that incorporated missing values using the above two methods. As Figures I1 and
I2 illustrate, the results of the analyses remained substantively unchanged, but the
standard errors increased because of the uncertainty associated with imputed data.
Given the limitations of multiple imputation and the complexity of a MI analysis
combined with a BCH correction for LCA misclassification, we have opted to retain
the reduced sample in the paper’s main analyses.
