"3" "Introduction"
"4" "British  national identity  discourses  in the year 19 90 included large “A spi rational” and “Aversive” clusters, a certain “C ommon  G round, ”  and a significant contest between   “ Thatcherite ”  and  “ anti-  Thatcherite  responses ”  to the deep economic malaise  that enveloped the country .    All  four  discourses  agreed that the  country’s power in the world was still significant,  even if they disagreed on the context and degree.  They also agreed that a   close alliance with America was necessary  in the era of the  failing Sov i et bloc,  of Saddam Hussein’s revisionism in the Gulf, and of  South Africa ’s re-entry into the community of nations."
"5" "Part  I: Text selection"
"6" "Our a rchive consists of texts sampled from  across  the following five genres:"
"7" "L eadership  speeches.   Like in 1950 and 1960,  the selection was based on a   combination of the  Queen’s Speech ,  which in 19 9 0  was  delivered in Parliament on 7  November, and  John Major’s first real  speech as Prime Minister at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre at  Westminster on 4 December 1990 ."
"8" "We collected   newspaper  items from  the  editions published on  15th day of every month  in the  right-leaning  Sun  and the l eft-leaning  the  Daily Mirror .  According to the ABC data for 1990,  The Sun  was dominant in  circulation numbers  and the   Mirror  was ahead of  Daily Mail .   Consistent with previous UK reports, we exclude d Sunday editions, which in this year fell on the 15th of both April and July ."
"9" "L ike before, we defined the category “op-ed” to include columns, editorials, opposite-the-editorial pieces and “letters to the editor” to cover both political and non-political commentary penned by the newspapers’ readership.  Also ,  as before, we erred on the side of inclusion. For example, Hilary Kingsley’s  Mirror  column “In My View” was  included in our sample even if though its author was primarily a TV critic . The same goes for “Dear Sue”   and “Dear Deidre”  in  The Sun —two personal problems letters sections that occasionally included national identity discussion s  (we  collected and  coded only  the  letters, not  Sue’s and Deidre’s  responses  to them ). Last , we classified the Mirror’s “Public Opinion—The Column You Write” as  sets of  individual  letters to the editor.  This  strategy  yielded  a newspaper sample with more letters (113) than op-eds (89), totalling  202   it ems in total .  (As in the 1980 UK report, there are more letters than op-eds.)"
"10" "For high  school textbooks  covering aspects of modern  British history, we selecte d, f irst,   An Economic and Social History of Britain, 1760-1970  by Trevor May, a  new textbook by Longman that appeared on  the market  in 1987; second,  a short pamphlet by Peter Connolly and Barry Phillips,  Britain 1900-1939 , published in 1989 by Spartacus Educational Publishers; third,  Consensus Politics from Attle e to Major  by Dennis Kavanagh and Peter Morris, two professors of politics, published by Blackwell in 1989. We selected three items instead of two because the last two were short and covered non-overlapping twentieth century periods and also because we wanted to a sense of economic, social and political histories taught in English and Welsh—probably Scottish and Northern Irish as well—high schools.  Indeed, each book was designed to help students with modal examination topics, such as  “the socia l problems of industrialization ”  and “the return to gold in 1925” (May 1987) or “the mixed economy” and “the welfare state” (Kavanagh  and  Morris 1989)."
"11" "Our   selections  for bestselling novels were  The Negotiator   by Frederick Forsyth  and  A Time to Die  by Wilbur Smith, two authors whose novels also appear in the 1980 UK report.  The two novels  can be described as  “airport novels”  produced  by  an Anglo-American  publishing industry  for a Western audience  (both had shiny covers imprinted  the author’s  name larger than the title itself)."
"12" "Between the two,  Negotiator  made for an easier selection . Forsyth’s  first novel in five years,   it centers on Cold War conspiracies of the near future relative to the year of the publication  ( 1990-1991, as seen from 1989 —a move Forsyth made in his novel  The Devil’s Alternative   examined in the 1980 report  as well ) and devotes roughly two hundred of its five hundred pages on English locations and characters.  Time to Die  was a harder choice because it is set mainly in Southern Africa —Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa . That said, Smith’s novel, too, centers on Cold War developments, in 1987, and is also a part of his bestselling “Courtney series” of novels that trace the history of a French-British-South African clan, the Courtneys, from the  1860s onwards,  across the world colonized by Britain."
"13" "Other top-selling novels of the year we considered were two sagas set in the Victorian era,  The Black Candle  (ranked 3 rd ) and  The Harrogate Secret  (ranked 6 th ), both by Catherine Cookson. The other top selling novels in this group were authored by the Americans,  Danielle Steel  (Star, ranked 4 th ) and Sidney Sheldon ( Sands of Time , ranked 5 th ). All of them, however, sold less than 3 million copies—compared to 4.7  million and 5.2 million for the Smith and Forsyth novels, respectively."
"14" "For movies, we selected  Shirley Valentine  (dir. Lewis Gilbert ), a film  based on a  theater play about  a 42-year-old Liverpool housewife  that won the title as the most-watched UK-made film of the year (ranked 11th overall) ,  and  The Krays  (dir. Peter Medak), a crime biopic of London's most notorious criminals in the 1960s, the twin brothers Krays.   Our runner-up, so to speak, was   Memphis Belle  (dir. Michael Caton-Jones), a movie about an American bomber crew flying out of England during World War II,  R anked second among UK-produced box office hits, alongside  The Krays ,  this  movie was not selected because it  catered to the  American audience, while also  depicting  relatively few aspects of British wartime history ."
"15" "As in all previous years, the top performers in UK cinemas in 1990 were Hollywood productions, namely  Ghost  and  Pretty Woman .   Other leading UK-produce d   box office  hits  of they year  were  Nuns on the Run  (dir. Jonathan Lynn),  Chicago Joe and the Showgirl  (dir. Bernard Rose),  Life is Sweet  (dir. Mike Leigh),  Hidden Agenda  (dir. Ken Loach), and  The Big Man  (di. David Leland). Note, however, that  some of these were released  in  late 1990 and became classified as blockbusters  only in the following year."

"335" "Full Table 1 (230  categories  in total , 1226  total codings ) is available on the project website."
"336" "II British Identities in 199 0"
"337" "Table 1 lists top identity c ategories, defined in this report as the top 15 percent or as “10 counts and above”  (For  the complete  list of identity categories, see the project website.)  For the first time in the UK series of identity reports,  democracy  emerges as a top category. Overall, democracy is positive across the so urces, albeit not always, as indicated in the title of our report,  “Britai n is supposed to be a democracy. ”"
"338" "In lea dership speeches, democracy  appears 5 times. The new prime minister, John Major, defines democracy as symbiotic with  capitalism ,  which  also appears 5 times in leadership speeches and is  in our analysis  of most frequent identity categories  and  ranked  sixth  overall .  Consider  the prime minister’s  deployment of the phrases “property-owning democracy” and “capital- owning democracy ” in his first speech of the year on December 4 :"
"339" "When I came into the Party we had set ourselves the goal of a propert y-owning democracy.  We wanted people to own their own homes.   Now two th irds of families do.  In the 1980s we worked for the capital owning democracy - more building society accounts, more shares, mor e personal pensions  (Major’s speech)."
"340" "From this passage we see that British democracy is also  family-oriented  and  Thatcherist , which in our analysis  of the 1990 archive  are top-20 identity categories. Like in any postwar year, owning a home was a key aspect of the  British dream—the  Brit ish conception of the good life.  Th atcherism, in contrast, was something alien ; indeed, the positive nod the prime minister gave to the policy (rhetoric) of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, was very much an exception.  A controversy involving something MP Normal Tebitt said publicly illustrated that, in addition to being democratic and capitalist, Britain saw itself as a  free  country, too : free to speak its mind, not simply a country of free enterprise  ( The Sun ,  May ; compare to Major’s speech )."
"341" "Of the three textbooks, all three mention the importance of good family life and one mentions Thatcherism, negatively (Kavannagh and Morris  1989 ).  Capitalism  was  typically  evaluated  in relation to  statism ,  socialism ,  democracy and of course  partisanship .   Consider the textbooks.  F or  Kavannagh and Morris , the statist postwar consensus had wide and deep roots, going back to the era before World War II: “ This is true of the National Health Service, Beveri dge’ s reform of welfare, and the public corporation form of nationalization  which built on Herbert Morrison’ s model of the Lo ndon Passenger Transport Board” ( 1989:  p. 16, also see p. 1).   May , quoting the phrase “Butskellism” from a 1954 issue of  The Economist , put it thus. “ From 1951 onwards there was no major issue which produced a fundamental cleavage between the official policy of the Conservativ es and that of the Labour Party” (p.   393)."
"342" "By  helping “destroy” the postwar consensus  through a series of lacerating cuts to social programs, Thatcher in fact  sought to “kill off socialism” ( Kavannagh and Morris  1989: 123). But t his was  plainly  ridiculous: “By this she seems to have meant less the elimination of the Labour Party (socialist or Labour parties exist as one of the two or three largest parties in every Western state except the United States and Ireland.” (Ibid.)."
"343" "The May  textbook further explains that the  Conservatives  tried to fight statism but failed—until Thatcher showed up. In 1951, the Conservatives ran on an ant i -nationalization platf orm. A decade later a white paper  issued by a Conservative government viewed some industries “ as social services absolved from economic and commer cial justification.  The issue is a political one and  has never been fully resolved” (pp. 393-4)."
"344" "Partisanship, not consensus, was in fact the historical norm. L ooking at Edwardian politics,  May  finds,  a “ respectable Englishman ” was either a Liberal or a Conservative, not a Socialist (p. 304).  Liberal reforms in the  Lloyd George  government  sought to create “ a socially  responsible form of capitalism”  and “ were concerned to discriminate between their ideas of state action to liberate the faculties of the individual, and what they saw as the complete control of economic an d social processes by the state (p. 304).  Labour emerged later, and with many birthing pains: they  “had long-term plans— t he introduction of socialism— but no short - term plans. (Keynes, it may be remembered, was of the view  that, ‘ I n the long run we are all dead.’ )  (p. 344).  More generally, Labour was understood as more beleaguered than the Tories. In writing a column about “ the sheer number of splits ” in the Thatcher government,   Alastair Campbell, in his column in the  Mirror  on 15 October, wrote: “ It used to be Labour that hung  out its dirty linen in public.”"
"345" "Thatcherism naturally opposed  trade unionism — a contemporary manifestation of   older,  “[m] ore  extreme sets of beliefs called ‘direct action’ and ‘syndicalism’   [that]  were largely i mported from the USA and France” (Connolly and  Phillips  1990: 2, also see  May , p. 242) and of a conservative plot to “ buy off and neutralise a k ey secti on of the working class” (May , p. 323).   Both  The Sun  and  Daily Mirror  published op-eds addressing the rifts in industrial relations: autoworkers versus Ford ( The Sun , January),  a local government worker union , NALGO,  vers us the government (Ibid., May) and of course the miner strikes ( Daily Mirror , June). Reflecting on the Thatcher years in November, the  Mirror  gave this verdict: “ Her biggest achievement was to destroy excessive trade union power .”"
"346" "A long-lasting recession and high  unemployment —we coded such self-identifications under the rubric  economically depressed — was made worse by government policies that resulted in  increasingly heavy mortgages. This is f rom a comment  piece  published in  The Mirror  in February:  “ Mrs  Thatcher won the 1979 election promising to make it easier and cheaper to buy a home, instead  she made it harder and dearer.  The dream of a property-owning democracy has become a nightmare. ”  ( Note  all newspaper dates refer to the newspaper edition published on  the 15th day of the month ).  The percentage of good manufacturing jobs was perceived as falling, due to technological change as well as the internationalization of production and finance."
"347" "O utside the two leadership speeches,  Thatcherism  was  in fact explicitly  understood  as a threat to  democracy .  A flurry of letters to the  editor  published in the same  newspaper  in March angrily  responded to  the  controversial  “Community Charge” , the new  flat-rate per capita  tax—a.k.a., the poll tax—to  be  collected by local councils. One: “ Dictator Thatcher should remember that he or she w h om the electorate vote in they can just as easily vote out. ” Two, from which we borrow the title of this report :  “ Britain is supposed  to be a democracy. If it was we’ d be able to vote on this tax. I firmly believe that most people in this country do not want the poll tax in its present form.  W e should ask for a referendum.”   Three : “ Does Mrs. Thatcher think we are all as stupid as she is? She says she thinks the poll tax is fair. Who for? ”  Four : “ Thatcher the Snatcher is a very good name for someone who should be ashamed. She gives to  the rich and robs from the poor.”  Five : “ The Tory government is determined to make the poor of Britain pay more while the rich pay less. ”  In November, the  Mirror  once again gave space to concerns about the nation’s democracy, this time one the editorial page:"
"348" "At the moment only Tory MPs have a vote in deciding who should be their leader and therefore our Prime Minister. Our message to them is simple and for that reason very short. We expect them on the day to  do   their duty. And that duty is to put Britain first."
"349" "Britain  self-identified as  orderly . This referred to good law and order practices  (see  fair/just  below) , to  national unity (see  patriotic , Northern Ireland ) and to public health, as in the mad cow disease scandal ( The Sun , May).  In  The Krays , London is a gangster paradise but in  The Negotiator  it  is merely “ gloomy ” and hard to get around.  O rderly  also referred to the  absence of revolutionary impulse. “ The dominant role of traditional social elites has never been seriously threatened and religion has never been as divisive as i n France or Italy, for example,” explain  Kavannagh and Morris  in their textbook (1990: 2 ). Accordingly, the situation in  Northern Ireland  was thoroughly  anti-British. First, why would anyone seek independence by bombing civilians, asked a columnist in  The Sun  (May)? Mrs .  N Ackroyd from Prudhoe, Northumbria, writing in  Daily Mirror  (November), sees it thus:"
"350" "If the United Nations— with t he backing of the whole world— can bring about a peaceful settlement of the Gulf crisis, it cou ld be the start of something we’ ve all dreamed of. With its new-found authority, the UN could become a genuine world body, bringing Israelis and Arabs to the negotiating table to settle their problems. Then it could act similarly and decisively in other disaster areas like N icaragua and Northern Ireland."
"351" "As for the Thatcher government, its policy towards the area was a combination of “resolute anti-terrorism”  and diplomacy—“ They will maintain positive relations wit h the Republic of Ireland” (Queen’s speech)."
"352" "(As an aside,  Britain understood itself as England.  This was not explicitly mentioned, but was rather assumed.  A description of  England  in the  May  textbook (P. 313-4) by “ Priestley, who was an acute observer, ”  is exceptional only because the author  mentions multiple  Englands . It is worth quoting at length since its weaves in  many of the identity categories mentioned earlier:"
"353" "Old England, the country of the cathedrals and minister and manor houses  and inns, of Parson and Squire… It has few luxuries, but nevertheless it is a luxury country. It has lon g ceased to earn its own living ... the nineteenth-century England, the industrial England of coal, iron,  steel, cotton, wool, railways… This England makes up the larger part of the Midlands and the North and exists everywhere; but it is not being added to and has no new life poured into it...the new post-war England of arterial and by pass roads, of filling stations and factories that look like exhibition buildings, of giant cinemas and dance-halls and cafes, bungalows with tiny garages, cocktail bars, Woolworths, motor-coaches, wireless, hiking, factory girls looking like actresses, greyhound racing and dirt tracks, swimming pools, and everything gi ven away for cigarette coupons…a fourth, ‘the England of Dole’… Even in England, which is no South Sea Island, there are places where a man feels he can do nothing cheerfully, where gay idling is not impossible. But the ironist in charge of our affairs has seen to it that the maximum of unemployment shall be in those very districts that have a tradition of hard work and of very little else...You have only to spend a morning in the dole country to see that it is all wrong. . . The whole thing is unworthy of a great country that in its time has given the world some nobly creative ideas. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. )"
"354" "Ranked second by frequency is an identity category we label  patriarchy/sexism . Surprisingly, this is evident only from the texts closer on the mass end of the continuum, from textbooks onwards. While the lea dership speeches and op-eds in our sample duly identify Britain as a place of equality between the sexes as well as  the “will and determination of one woman” (Major’s speech),  no piece directly addresses the problem of sexism. A partial exception is a newspaper piece on  multinational cosmetic companies  and their marketing tricks by  Christena Appleyard,  The Mirror’s  “Woman’s E ditor ” (March):"
"355" "The scientific presentation gives these products a curious credibility. Removing them almost from the luxury cosmetic category and re-positioning them in the investment-purchase sector. So women are almos t bamboozled into thinking they’ re buy ing a medicine. Not make-up. It’ s clever stuff. No ordinary woman knows enough about the subject to distinguish between the fac ts and scientific gobblede g ook."
"356" "The  use of the phrase “ordinary women”  and the presence of a separate woman’s issues column in a top newspaper indicates that female subordination was both normal and normalized.  The novels advanced this attitu de even further. In  The Negotiator , among forty key characters, only two are female—an  FBI agent  Sam Somerville, who is professional but also gorgeous and a “good cook,” and Margaret Thatcher.  A Time to Die   has a lot of time for  misogyny and subjugation   of women. Claudia to Sean: “I’m only brave when you’re here.”"
"357" "The textbooks were  explicit about Britain’s  patriarchal  Self . The  May  textbook notes that the changes began in World War I: “M any people were surprised at the heavy wo rk which women could accomplish , although this was due partly to an ignorance of the nature  of much pre-war women’s work” (p. 323). Yet, progress was not straightforward because of the “one-sidedness” of gender politics:"
"358" "the Lancashire pit-brow lasses stopped work as recently as 1966, and it is worth noting that even today some women still work underground in the United States. There have always been those who argue that women should be free to do any work they wish, and it cannot be denied that the attitude of  Parliament to unsuitable women’ s work was often one-sided. More often than not the decision was made to ban women from such work rather than to improve the co nditions of  men and women alike (p. 270)."
"359" "Patriarchy  is critiqued  most directly in  the  two  movies.   Shirley ’s opening scenes center on the boredom and gloom of female domesticity in contemporary Liverpool life: Shirley is an empty-nester housewife who like s  to drink and talk to the kitchen wall, lamenting a past that appeared to promise her a more romantic life. In one scene, Shirley’s husband becomes violent after learning about an unauthorized change in his habitual Thursda y steak-and-chips dinner menu."
"360" "This  behaviour pushes Shirley over the edge. She goes on a  two-week holiday to  Greece—a lottery win— with an old girlfriend,  Jane. A dialogue with a neighbour, Millandra, in which Shirley yells through her window:"
"361" "Millandra: Greece,  at your age, you and that Jane? It’s obscene !"
"362" "Shirley: That’ s right, Millandra, I'm going to Greece for the sex! Sex for breakfast! Sex for dinner! Sex for tea! And sex for supper!"
"363" "Random delivery man : Sounds like a fantastic diet, love!"
"364" "Shirley Valentine: It is, have you neve r heard of it? It’s called the F  plan!"
"365" "In Greece, Shirley does end up having sex  with a mustache-sporting l ocal restaurant owner Costas.  Eventually , she  returns to her husband, in what seems to be a reve rsal of power relations : “ I know. I used to be The Mother. I  used to be The Wife. But now I’ m Shirley Valentine again. Would you like to join me for a drink? ”  "
"366" "The Krays , which in fact portrays a matriarchal criminal family, offers several lines and dialogues that at once reproduce and question the gendered order of things.  In one  scene,  t he  twins’   mother Violet and grandmother  (or aunt?)  Rose agree that  “ m en are bo rn children and stay children. T hink they are   in control but  don’t  know the half of it.”  In  another, Violet mocks the local officer of the law who trips over her broom while searching for her  draft-dodging  h usband Charlie:   “ H ousework is a lethal business, constable. ”  In yet another, “ a house is a bloody battleground all on  its own,” she says to Charlie .    Then there is this fascinating exchange between Rose and Violet, about the life and death in working class London during World War II:"
"367" "Rose: I was on the bus the other day. And some old t oerag was boasting about all he’ d suffered during the war. Stu pid old... I tell you, they don’ t know. It was the women who had the war - the real war. The women were left at home in the shit, not sitting in some sparklin g plane or gleaming tank. There’ s no glamour for us. They should have been with me when old Pauli ne Woolley went in to labour. D’ you remember that, Violet?"
"368" "Violet : Yes, yes I do, darling."
"369" "Rose: Seven hours of screaming down Bethnal Green bloody tube stat ion. Then I had to cut the baby’ s head off - to save the mother's life. She died anyway, poor old cow. God, there was so much blood! Jesus! And the abortions. Those poor girls. One day they'll drain Victoria Park lake. And you know  what they’ ll find? What glorious remnants of the  Second World War? Babies, that’ s what. Bu llets and dead babies. Men! Mum’ s right. They stay kids all their fucking lives. And they end up heroes - or monsters. Either way they win. Women have to grow up. If  they  stay children, they become victims."
"370" "Notwithstanding the most recent Tory attacks on the poor (see above),  Britain understoo d itself as  less  classist  than ever before as  well as thoroughly clas s based. T he  Kavannagh and Morris  textbook focuses much of its analysis on “the people”. Examples:"
"371" "The 1939-35 war, like that of 1914-1918, was important in advancing the case for welfare in Britain. The experience enhanced the sense of social sol i darity, alerted many of the better off to the extent of poverty and hardship and, so some historians claim, encouraged the notion of a contract  between people and government (p. 72)"
"372" "The people had sacrificed much in the struggle against Hitler and, in return, expected the government to pro duc e a better post-war society. (p.74)"
"373" "In his textbook,  too,  May  writes that his fellow historians think that the rise of the welfare state, Labour and trade unions means that the ‘working class’ is a more meaningful category in 1990 than in 1800 (p. 234). As for class  e galitarianism ,  it arose out of World War I,  eventually  diffusing to other axes of oppression , namely gender and race:"
"374" "A realisation by ordinary men and women that their co-operation was essential to the well-being of the country contributed towards a major social change- the decline of deference and the spr ead of a mood of egalitarianism… Harold Macmillan, wh o later spoke of the ‘wind of change’  himself, felt that breez e as a young officer in France” (p. 321, 322)."
"375" "Britain aspired to be  progressive  (10 counts) but  here , too, partisanship appeared  important: “ Labour was committed in   a way that Conservatives were not to racial equalit y, internationalism, and ‘the b r otherhood of man’ , which meant enthusiastic acceptance of a multiracial, internationalist Commonwealth  and also of the United Nations” ( Kavannagh and Morris  1990: 93)."
"376" "Related to the issue of class was Britain’s love-hate rela tionship with the royal family, who still ruled the entire Commonwealth. Canada, suggest Connolly and  Phillips  (1990: 18), “ has a special affection and loyalty for the King, whom she rega rds as one of her own citizens.” Their everyday lives were closely followed in the two newspapers, especially in the letters section.  A letter appearing in the January edition of  Daily Mirror  agrees with  Princess Diana ’s title as   “Britain’s most elegant woman”:   “ She may be rich, but it takes a woman of style to pick the right clothes and know how to wear them. ” But in May, the same newspaper published a very different take on  the monarchs  in general :"
"377" "Prince Charles should have been th e last person to attack Russia’ s 70 horrendous years under Communism during his Hungary visit. His despotic relatives, the Tzars, drove the Russians to revolution out of starvati on and despair. Kings and Queen s have plundered and robbed throughout history while throwing crumbs to their subjects. Our own Royal Family is still obscenely wealthy today. Communism has been bad for Communist countries. But it has been good for Western workers. It forced capitalists to be fairer for fear that the Red tide would engulf them."
"378" "Then, in November, this short letter, by Mrs M. Peake from Lower Feltham, Middlesex:"
"379" "As a World War Two veteran’ s wife , I was horrified that , on the day we honoured our dead, the Prince and Princess of Wales honoured the new Emperor of Japan. So many of our young la ds died at the hands of Akihito’ s father. I was sickened."
"380" "P atriotism  was seen as aspirational. For the elites like Prime Minister Major, this was only a positive category: in his speech he declared he wanted to see only one kind of savings in the economy: “ I want those savings to be British. ” For the masses and in the textbook, there was more ambiguity. For example, in the eponymous movies, t he  Krays  decline to serve in the army  by deciding to walk away from their obnoxious drill sergeant. “ And where do you littl e darlings think you’re off to?,” asks the sergeant. “ Home,  for a cup of tea with our mum,” says one of the twins.   “Look, you’ ve got nothing to say and you're saying it too loudly. So... bollocks,” the other one adds. Then they both punch the man in his  face,   to the delight of the other cadets."
"381" "Britain defined itself at once as  fair/just  (17 counts) and  unfair  (10 counts).  The Queen’s Speech intimates that Britain is continuously working on justice, and not just for its people: “ A Bill will again be brought before you to give our courts the jurisdictio n to try alleged war criminals.” Both newspaper samples had no shortage of  justice system stories , some of which had direct implication for what it means to be British . An example is the sentencing on  13 December  of Russell Bishop in Brighton for child molestation and abduction, but not for  the  “ Babes in the Wood murders ” that  appeared to  either  pro mpt   or index  a  nation-wide  debate on  whether double jeopardy and/or capital punishment were right from Britain  ( The Sun , two op-eds) ."
"382" "What was unfair was the poll tax (above) and, according to Smith in  A Time to Die , life in general. Here is an excerpt from a dialogue about a safari:"
"383" "So the gam e is still on, Colonel,  or should we rather call it the hunt? You are a great hun ter, a great white hunter… You call it sport, and you pride yourself on what you term \"fair chase ” ….I have never understood your white  man’ s passion for this pursuit. To me it always seemed so pointless. My people have always believed that if you want meat, you should kill it as efficiently and with a s little effort as possible. P erhaps you have corrupted me, Colonel. Perhaps I am acquiring your decadent European ways, but for the first time I understand your passion. Perhaps it is simply that at last the game is big enough to excite me. I wonder how you must feel at this change of role, Colonel. You are the game and I am the hunter. I  know where you are, but you don’ t know where I am. Perhaps I am closer than you believe possible. Where am I Colonel? You must guess. You must run and hi de. When will we meet, and how?"
"384" "The world of Smith’s novel is similarly socially Darwinist: African Marxist dictators versus Western corporations versus Europ ean settlers versus the poor.  In The Negotiator,  Cold War r ealpolitik is  simply  brutal: the Soviets are about to invade Iran and the U.S.  oil- military-industrial complex is sabotaging a liberal President’ s arms reduction treaty with the  Soviets.  The world of  The Krays  is  in fact  similar:  “ When people are afr aid of you, you can do anything”  says  one brother to another."
"385" "The nation was defined as at once  powerful/influential  and  declining .  British power was understood as historical, moral, military a nd  technological.  For one, Britain was a  modern, developed  and  well-educated  country—obvious facts in the context of comparisons with the countries of the crumbling Eastern bloc or of the Third World, to s ay nothing of Britain’s own history of violence against  the poor, against women and children,  and against the colonized people .  Worl d War II was the most common idea of  British  greatness , followed  by a period called   postwar consensus— a  “ period of twenty years when nearly all th e deep objectives of the state—i n economic planning, social welfare, harmony and the avoidance of crises — seemed to have be en achieved” (Middlemass,  in  Kavannagh and Morris  1990: 4)."
"386" "In the Cold War context Britain thought of itself as exceptionally  well-armed —perhaps a little too well. According to Kavannagh and Morris, “ The breakdown of the wartime alliance with the USSR led to the maintenance of high levels of defence expend iture and conscription.  Britain’s defence expenditure in 1952 was higher in per capita terms than that of  the United States” (pp. 94-5).”   Britain was simultaneously  diplomatic , a national identity that in 1990 was epitomized, for good or ill, in the figure of foreign secretary,  Douglas Hurd (for ill, see  Mirror ’s comment in the October issue)."
"387" "Outside the textbooks, t he idea of  decline was not discussed as often as we expected—evidence perhaps that it was thoroughly internalized  in 1990. The  Kavannagh and Morris  textbook  is an exception. Consider  the  coverage of the “ end of empire ,” for example : “ The questioning of the viability of the Commonwealth coincided with the sud d en decline in confidence refe rred to elsewhere about Britain’ s prospects as a great power, both politically and economically ”  (1989 : 104).  The May  textbook accepts this, but finds other causes as well:"
"388" "If Britain was the first country to enter an industrial world, is it possible that she might be the first to enter a post-industrial one? Such a possibility was discussed by the American economist John Kenneth Galbrai th in a BBC interview in 1977: ‘ Your real problem is that you were the first of the great industrialised nations, and so things happen here first. You are living out the concern for some more leisurely relationship with industrial life that the other people have been d iscussing for 50 years or more.’  In the following year, the London correspondent of  the  Washington Post  wrote that ‘ Britons...appear to be the first citizens of the post-industrial age who are choosing leis ure over goods on a large scale’ . And in the last week of the decade, the  Sunday Times  wrote: ‘ As the Seventies began Britain exported £150 worth of manufactures for every £100 we imported. Today we export just £1 15 for every £100 of imports. We  have become self-sufficient in North Sea Oil, but the envy of our industrial rivals has given way to more practical sentiments; selling us their cars, calculators, video recorders, and digital watches. Pessimistic  commentators argue that Britain’ s relative decline may become an absolute decline, as swathes of our manufacturing industry become obliterated by foreign competition. But if the balloon does go up, we shall at least be able to watch and record it in colour, and time  it to one-hundredth of a second ’  (p. 277)."
"389" "As well as having social and economic ambitions, politicians (and others) have diplomatic ones. Britain might have solved her economic problems more easily had she accepted sooner the fact that she had emerged from the war a greatly diminished power, no longer in the same rank as the Soviet Union or the United States. Her leadership of the Commonwealth did not prove an adequate counterweight. In 1962 the former US Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, declared, ‘Britain has lost an empire, she has not yet found a role’. That role might have been the leadership of a new Europe, but Britain awoke late to the idea of a European Community, and did not in fact enter the European Economic Community until 1973. Politicians found it hard to explain to the public  Britain’s economic, strategic and global position. Not only did they promise more than they could perform; the public demanded more th an it was prepared to pay for (p. 414)."
"390" "From this perspective,  Britain’s decline app ears to be self-inflicted— the British people are victims of the ir own historical success  as well as their own illusions of grandeur.  The word  “ peop le ”  is apt: illusions, for May ,  did not rest with British state officials alone ."
"391" "The textbook treated the British Empire as a folly, both economic and moral, finding comfort in the seemingly  post-imperial  present. For May , who cites Lenin approvingly, imperial conquests benefitted only capitalists: “the white dominions— Cana da, Australia and South Africa— were the favoured market, and  by 1913 37 per cent of Britain’ s overseas investments were there, with a further 10 per ce nt in India bringing the Empire’s share to almost half (p. 193). This did not make a difference to the poor at home:"
"392" "Dreadnought battleships were, of course, necessary for the maintenance of imperial glory. And here lay a second contrast, tha t the nation which was bearing ‘the white man’s burden’  in the colonies, turned a blind eye to the problems at hom e. Winston Churchill declared, ‘ I see little glory in an Empire which can rule the waves and is  unable to flush its own sewers’ (p. 393)."
"393" "The  Smith novel  agrees that the empire was no more  but  does not necessarily agree that this   was always a good thing or that the old imperial structures did not matter. A n early  description of a meeting between Sean, a local white settler  and the main protagonist , and the two Americans on a hunting safari,  Riccard o and Claudia  Monterro, sets a nostalgic tone : “ There were twenty servants to care for three of them, all so sybaritic and colonial and explo itative. This was 1988, for God’ s sake , and the empire was long gone,  but the whisky was delicious. ”"
"394" "Forever changing according to the dictates of modernity, Britain in 1990 struggled with the rise of mindless  consumerism  and obsession over  image  and style rather than substance.  This was in evidence in the letters sample, in the movies, and in the novels—the mass side of our archive.  In  The Krays , the  sadistic  gangster twins, Ronald and Reginald Kray,  grow up to   become  Savile Row suit-wearing  national celebrities—a true measure of success. A dialogue between them and Palendri, their Italian American Mafioso partner:"
"395" "Palendri: I love London—It’ s so wonde rfully dirty. And The Beatles— I adore The  Beatles. You know The Beatles?"
"396" "Reginald: No ."
"397" "Ronald : I believe they know us."
"398" "The Krays’ popularity makes one rival gangster, George Cornell, upset:"
"399" "Kray brothers, splattered all over the papers. Bloody heroes, they are! This to charity, that to charity, the other to charity …I’ m out there earwigg ing it on the street and what I’ m hearing is Kray Kray Kray Kray Kray!  The pavement stinks with Kray!... I say shoot the bastards. Shoot them. What are they, a pair of bumboys, let's put them out of their misery! A couple of movie gangsters! All they're interested in is what the y look like! They make me sick!... They walk down the street like Kings!"
"400" "I n the Smith novel,   Claudia is repeatedly configured as strange for being anti-materi alistic. A description of her relationship with her father Riccardo:"
"401" "Because he set so much store by wealth and possessions Claudia had deliberately turned down the $200,000 job she was offered after graduating fifth in her law class and instead had taken one at $4 0,000 in a civil rights agency… her work with the indigenous Inuit People of Alaska gave her satisfaction enhanced by his disapproval."
"402" "The British bemoaned the overly  bureaucratic  nature of their state. Also,  the British bureaucrats were too  traditional , much like Britain  in general . In  France, the May  textbook explains,"
"403" "the governing elite share a similar educational background, and the men move freely between public administration and industry in a way which is quite alien to British practice. For those who enter British management, certain backgrounds are likely to lead to speedier promotion than others. Thus, training in the law or accountancy (more gentlemanly activities) is likely to have an advantage for career advancement greater than expertise in engineering. In Britain, provision for technical education outran demand; in Japan, entrance into engineering programmes has been highly competitive, more so than for any other area except medicine. There are very few engineers and scientists in the administrative class of the British civil service, wher e government policy is formed (p. 413)."
"404" "Note the importance of  the American  referent in  the above  quotations. In the archive  America  emerges as Britain’s  most significant Other, comparable only to  Europe  (23 counts), e ither as a stand-alone category, as in the above reference to  the Europe an Economic Community, EEC,  or  as  compounded with , and represented by,   France   (10 counts)  and  Germany   (14 counts) .  This also meant that Britain was decidedly  Western  (18 counts), meaning not only capitalist and democratic, but also multicultural: “ Now the Ministry of Defence want to ban carols for ou r lads in the Gulf because they’ ll offend the Saudis. The bureaucrat loonies should tell the Saudis that we allo w mosques in our country and we’d appreciate a small ge sture in retu rn ( Daily Mirror , November, letter)."
"405" "Leadership speeches do emphasize Britain’s ties to America, merely that the Queen’s is looking forward to visiting that country (Queen’s Speech). In the textbooks, newspapers, and novels  the British elites are  consistently  pro-American. “The bulk of he Labour Party— a nd  almost all Conservatives— viewed US militaristic and econo mic assistance with enthusiasm,” note  Kavannagh and Morris  (1990: 95). Furthermore, Britain self-identified as  less powerful but more substantial than the U.S.  It is also better governed, as explained in  The Negotiator :"
"406" "Washington insiders will sometimes, in complete privacy, admit to British friends that they would give their right arms for the British governmental system."
"407" "The British system is fairly simple. The Queen is the head of state and she stays in place. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is always the leader of the party that wins the general election. This has two advantages. The nation’s chief executive cannot be at loggerheads with a majority from the opposing political party in Parliament (which facilitates necessary, though not always popular, legislation) and the incoming Prime Minister after an election victory is almost always a skilled and e xperienced politician at the na tional level, and probably a former Cabinet Minister in a previous administration. The experience, the know-how, the awareness of how things happen and how to make them hap-pen, are always there."
"408" "In London there is a third advantage. Behind the politicians stands an array of senior civil servants who probably served the previous administration, the one before that, and the one before that. With a hundred years of experience at the top between a dozen of them, these “mandarins” are of vital help to the new winners. They know what happened last time and why; they keep the records; they know where the land mines are situated."
"409" "As the  May  textbook explains, British decline relative to the  US was a century old ph enomenon that had do with  factors including the inefficient use of capital,  lower productivity, short-termism  of British managers, traditionalism ( a.k.a., the relative lack of “social depth of demand” )   and the pervasiveness of “gentleman’s agreements” as opposed to formal rules  (pp.  154,  284-8 , 295 ). An obvious factor was also the size and scale of Britain’s competitors:"
"410" "In 1903 Sir Norman Lockyer, in his presidential address  to the British Association on ‘ The Infl uence of Brain Power on History’ , contrasted the 22 state-subsidised universities of Germany and 134 state and private universities in American with the 13 in Great Britain. Britain had fallen behind these two nations in her economic growth  (p. 83)."
"411" "Lastly, the war, too:"
"412" "However financially indebted to the Americans the British might be, there were those who argued patriotically, but not unrealistically, that she could still hold her head high. Thus  The Economist  wrote: “Our present needs are the direct consequence of the fact that we fought earliest, that we fought longest, and that we fought hardest. In moral terms we are creditors” (p. 378)."
"413" "On the plus side, m en living in a “ working-class area of Manches ter, before the First World War” lived by a moral code that praised stoicism, among other things: “ Through the Old School we learned to admire guts, integrity, tradition, we derided the glutton , the American and the French” (p. 83)."
"414" "The letters sample show a high degree of interest in, and knowledge of, American culture. In  The Mirror , for example, readers various could learn about the American origins of the phrase “at the drop of a hat” (August), talk about the merits of American comedians Joan Rivers (June), or  Brooke Shields  and  Bob Hope  (December) or, in  The Sun , wonder about the similarities and differences in British versus American popular music (January).  In  The Krays , Ronald invokes two Wild West characters,  Colonel Custer and Geronimo, as “proper men.”"
"415" "Th e  May  textbook connects America’s cultural power  to America’s economic strength: “ Around 80 per cent of the vacuum cleaners sold in Britain were made abroad, one American brand leadin g many people still to talk of ‘hoovering the carpet’ , irrespective of the mak e of vacuum cleaner they employ” (p. 335).  The Connolly-Phillips textbook suggest that “lower classes” were in fact less anti-American:"
"416" "The upper class viewed Edward VIII stepping down to marry Mrs. Wallis Simpson from America more of an issue because sh e was American, not because she’d already been divorced twice.  The lower classes do not mind her being an American but loathe the idea that sh e has had two husbands already (p. 19)."
"417" "As for politics, there was a sense that  Britain, while a once-powerful and still- influential actor on th e world stage, was essentially a   blind  follower  of the US . A man from Lincolnshire wrote to  The Sun  in relation to the Gulf War to say that “[w] hen American Secretary of State James Baker and President Bush start talks with Saddam Hussein, our Foreign Secretary Dou glas Hurd should also take part,” because “[t] he lives of o ur soldiers are at stake, too” (December).    In discussing Lend-Lease, the  May  textbook wants the reader to know that the Americans were not being altruistic; rather, this historically important agreement “ was a mixture of friendly generosity and  hard-as-nails business dealing” (p. 370).  The same textbook points out that America posed problems for Britain’s foreign policy:"
"418" "Britain’ s attitude to Europe at the end of the Second World War was haughty, and reflected feelings that were themselves a compound of sentimental attachment to the Commonwea lth and a desire to foster the ‘special relationship’  which it was thought  existed with the United States (p. 402)."
"419" "The meanings of Europe vary across the sources and context. One common perspective is superiority: “ At the end of the war Britain was the only imperial and West European state with the status of a world power ” ( Kavannagh and Morris,  p. 5).   This is also evident in the Smith novel, at least from the perspective of the protagonist , Sean, who compares the British and Portuguese empires in Africa thus:"
"420" "“ your average Indian or African living today in a former British colony is a damned sight worse off now than he was then. Certainly that goes one hundred times more for your average  black man living in Mozambique.”"
"421" "Claudia: “At least they’re free,”  Claudia cut in."
"422" "Sean laughed. “ This is freedom? An economy managed under the well-known socialist principles of chaos and ruination which has resulted in a negative growth rate of up to ten percent per annum for every year  since the Portuguese withdrawal... The only worse countries in the world are Afghanistan and Angola, but as you say, at least they are free. In America, where everybody eats three huge meals a day, freedom may be a big deal, but in Africa a full belly c ounts for a hell of a lot more.”"
"423" "Another common perspective  on Europe  is  the existence of sharp cultural and  political difference s. In Shirley, Shirley offers to work for her lover in Greece by making “eggs and chips” for British tourists who come to his seaside café and who cannot deal with Greek food.  Yes, France was an interesting destination for British pensioners, some of whom were in fact interested in buying rural French homes ( The Sun , June), but the French government was neither a close friend nor a trustworthy ally of Britain . A letter published in  The Mirror  in the August issue:"
"424" "It’ s typical of the underhand French to hang bac k from the Iraqi confrontation— especially since the British are involved. We received no thanks for freeing France in 1944 and we have little to thank them for over the Falklands War, in which French missiles took  many British lives. French self- interest is again served by keeping out of the Gulf trouble, since they supply Iraq with weapons."
"425" "Another problem with France: “ [T] he British political experience differs markedly from that of its nearest neighbour, France, where a powerful Communist Party was for a long period able to challenge the underlying pr emises of state foreign policy” (Kavannagh and Morris, p. 91)."
"426" "Like in the equivalent British identity reports for 1950-1980, the German Other looms large, mostly via the war.  Few  minutes into the movie  Krays ,  for example,  we see  the boys and their mom in a bomb shelter and  the rubble on the streets  left behind by the Blitz —a testament to the tough life of East Londoners.  Contemporary Germany is a different place: threatened by red terrorism and a little too enamoured with civil rights ( The Negotiator )."
"427" "Beyond the Atlantic, the most significant Other in the 1990 archive was  South Africa .   The relationship was configured narrowly: our  anti-racist  state and society versus their racist government. T he Queen’s speech mentioned the need for a  “policy of encouragement …to  create through peaceful means a democratic non-raci al society.”  The masses supported this policy but did not necessarily think it would actually work.  The Sun  showed interest in  the life and politics of  Nelson Mendela  but  expressed  skepticism in his  ability to unite the country  after the end of  apartheid (February, March).  Over in  Daily Mirror , a TV columnist praised a “ non-preachy BBC film about the accidental death of a corrupt mayor in South Africa. ”   Non-preachy meant this: “ How brave to sh ow acts of black harshness—a ‘necklacing’  with a burning tyre and the pushing of soap powder and o il down the throats of black wo men who’ d bought from white sh ops” (December)."
"428" "In  A Time to Die ,  Sean Courtney,  t he  professiona l hunter and  a forme r Rhodesian army colonel ,  did not think a democratic, non-racial South Africa was possible either . A selection of  his dialogues with  Claudia , a naïve American  damsel :"
"429" "One:"
"430" "“D id  you know I am a South African?” he asked."
"431" "She looked apalled. “I thought you were a Brit.”"
"432" "He shook his head and smiled i n that infuriating way of his. “ I imag ine you support your government’ s sanctions against my  country.”"
"433" "“ Of co urse. Every decent person does.”"
"434" "“ Even if it means a million blacks  starve as a direct consequence?” […] . You forced your own citizens to sell our assets back to us at five cents on the dollar. Overnight you created two hundred multimillionaires in South Africa, and every one of them had a white face. Congratulations and our si ncere thanks, ducky.”"
"435" "Two:"
"436" "When she called him a racist, he only smiled."
"437" "“ In America that word is dreaded as the ultim ate insult that can end a man’s political  career, ruin his business, or ostracize him from society. You are all so terrified of it, and the blacks know it and exploit it to the full. Even the toughest hard-headed businessmen or politician rolls over like a puppy dog a nd whines if you call him that,” Sean told her gleefully. “ This isn't America, ducky, and here we aren't terrified of that word. Here racism is the same as tribalism, and we are all blatant tr ibalists, especially the blacks . If you want to exp erience true dedic ated tribalism and racism, then come and live in one of the newly independent African states. If you call your average black politician a racist, he would take it as a compliment. It would be the  same as calling him a patriot.”"
"438" "Three:"
"439" "“ I kee p forgetting you’ re  [South African], which is silly of me. You don ’ t attempt to conceal your bigotry. The simple fact is that your government and apartheid are t he scourge and curse of Africa.”"
"440" "“ Of course, we are responsible for everything- the AIDS epidemic, the famines of Ethiopia and Angola and Mozambique, the breakdown of government in Uganda and Zambia, the corr uption in Nigeria and Zaire, it’ s all a dirty South African plot. ”"
"441" "Later in the novel, Claudia is  abducted and tortured by a local warlord,  General China. This experience leads her to  agree with  some of  Sean’s point s. Here is an excerpt of the Claudia-China dialogue:"
"442" "My very dear Miss Monterro, your childlike belief in the myth of the essential goodness of mankind is really rather touching. I certainly have not fought so hard and so long to gain power simply to hand it over to a bunc h of illiterate peasants. . . ."
"443" "So you’ re every bit as  bad as you say the others are.’  There were hot spots of anger on Claudia's cheeks. This was the man who had put chains on her wrists and incarcerated her in that vile pit. She hated him with all her strength."
"444" "“ I think you are actually beginning to understand at last, even through the haze of your liberal emotions. In Africa, there are no good guys and no bad guys, there  are simply winners and losers.” He smiled again. “ And I assure you, Miss Monterro, that I intend to be one of t he winners.”"
"445" "The Negotiator  also sees the world in  dog-eat-dog terms , with its share of torturers (the female character, Sam, is tortured in this novel too), terrorists, child pornographers, and racists. An excerpt from a  moment when  Quin poses as someone else to gain information from a  shady  Belgian named  Kuyper:"
"446" "“F ought there from ’62 to ’67,” [Quin]  said  [in reference to Congo] . “With   Schramme and Wauthier. They were all Belgians in those days down there. Mostly Flemings. Best fighters in the world.”"
"447" "That pleased Kuyper. He nodded somberly at the truth of it all."
"448" "“Taught those black bastards a lesson, I can tell you.”"
"449" "Kuyper liked that even more."
"450" "“I nearly went,” he said regretfully. He had evidently missed a major opportunity to kill a lot of Africans. “Only I was in jail.”"
"451" "Note that the  Soviet  Union, with its  9  identity mentions in the archive, does not appear in Table 1 .  The leadership speeches do not mention the old Cold War enemy, only that the government “ will take forward work on restructuring our forces to reflect the welcome changes in E urope” (Queen’s Speech).  The  novels, both Cold War thrillers, are full of odious Soviets, however; they are  drunk and racist in  A Time To Die , and scheming and powerful in  The  Negotiator .    Saddam Hussein’s Iraq (7 counts) is similarly threatening and distant, as our more generally Africa (7 counts)  and the Middle East (8 counts)."
"452" "Part II I Discourses  of British identity  in 199 0"
"453" "Our clustering of identity categories recovered from the archive is presented in Table 2. The UK aspired to be an ever-better nation by being more anti-racist, more free, more influential in the world, more orderly, more progressive , and better educated overall.  Anti-racism and progress were normal in  one of the most multicultural societies in the world, due to its high level of immigration.  Some of these  categories  we re subject to elite-mass divide, however.  Anti-racism, for example, appeared to be an elite preoccupation, the lack of orderliness upset the masses more t han the elites and so on.  We  call  these “Aspirational Identities. ”"
"454" "Simultaneously, the UK wanted to be less patriarchal, less partisan, less classist, less fake, less consumerist and stronger economically. Here, too, there was some elite-mass divide. The masses seemed more relaxed about patriarc hy, about unfairness, and  about consumerism than the ruling elite, who in fact barely registered these as issues. Everyone fretted about the po or state of the economy. We label  this cluster “Aversive.”"
"455" "“Modern Britain ” as well as the “Significant Others” were areas of little contestation between the elites and the masses. Everyone agreed that the UK was at once diplomatic and w ell-armed  (militaristic).  Western  and post-Imperial  identities were not questioned ,  and neither the fact that the county could be both modern and developed as well as  monarchic and traditional. The US was very important and close, followed by the ancient European  rivals-turned- friends, France and Germany. South Africa and Northern Ireland were bot h the opposite of the modern UK .   Politically and eco nomically, the country was very centra lized. As always,  all rounds led to London."
"456" "On post-imperial status, the novels disagreed that  the UK was “post”. Rather, it was a still-powerful country, with no shortage of influence, both military and diplomatic, stretching across the continents, covering all of the territories of the British Empire and beyond.  Outsiders assume that  British were  culturally similar to, if  better-governed than, their European neighbors and their American allies .  But this was not true: Britain was unique."
"457" "“Thatcherite” is  a  cluster of identities. T he  y ears of the Thatcher government and  Thatcherite reforms  affected numerous w a y s in which  the British  view ed   the world and their place in it  in 1990 : as capitalist, patriotic, and family oriented and anti-bureaucratic. They were  one of the world’s wealthiest nations, with a quality of life to match, and  were   ready to trade to capitalize on the end of the Cold War.  This discourse was strong only among a segment of the elite."
"458" "The  oppositional  “ Anti- Thatcherite”  discourse emphasized democracy and fairness/justice.  As its name implies, its target was the prime minister and the hierarchical politics she represented. This discourse  had a lot of time not only for trade unions and postwar statism, but also for socialism , though less than as a political program and more as an alarm bell waking people up from their  resignation and polite  deference to Britain’s political class.  This time, the problem was not necessarily with Britain, but with the free world in the sense that no Western democracy appear ed to have good answers to the  growing power of multinational corpor ations and transnational capital .  This  discourse was stronger at the mass level ."
