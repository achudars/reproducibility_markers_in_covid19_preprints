Abstract
This article examines the relative impact of religious factors on Americans’ attitudes toward
adoption by same-sex couples. Drawing upon national survey data, we fit logistic regression
models and compute standardized logistic regression coefficients to estimate the relative net
effects of religious tradition, practices, and beliefs about the Bible on support for same-sex
adoption. Findings reveal that religious factors are among the strongest predictors of opposition
to same-sex adoption, but that religious tradition has no significant effect on support for samesex adoption once frequency of religious practice and beliefs about the Bible are held constant.
Americans who more frequently engage in practices such as religious service attendance and
sacred text reading are less supportive of same-sex adoption, and compared to biblical literalists,
those who believe the Bible requires interpretation, contains human error, or is a book of
history/legends are all more likely to support same-sex adoption. Findings suggest that religious
affiliations matter less for predicting same-sex adoption attitudes than how Americans practice
and hold their faith.

Public opinion toward gay and lesbian romantic and family relationships serves as an important
barometer of future voting patterns and policy decisions regarding the legal recognition of samesex unions (Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2005, 2008; Olson, Cadge, & Harrison, 2006). Landmark
legislation or judicial decisions concerning family formation, particularly at the federal level, are
most often precipitated by shifting opinions among the American public (Frank & Mceneaney,
1999; Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2005; Rosenfeld, 2007). Consequently, investigations into what
social and ideological factors tend to predict support or opposition toward same-sex
relationships—and just as important, which factors matter more than others—help adumbrate the
axes on which future public debates regarding same-sex families will turn.
Over the past three decades, a voluminous body of research examining the social
correlates of attitudes toward same-sex romantic relationships finds that religious factors such as
conservative Protestantism (vis-á-vis other religious affiliations or no affiliation) and frequent
church attendance are among the most consistent predictors of opposition to same-sex sexuality,
marriage, and civil unions (Adamczyk & Pitt, 2009; Burdette, Ellison, & Hill, 2005; HaiderMarkel & Joslyn, 2008; Lubbers, Jaspers, and Ultee, 2009; Olson et al., 2006; Schulte & Battle,
2004; Whitehead & Baker, 2013; Whitehead, 2010). Far less attention, by comparison, is given
to the ways in which religious factors predict Americans’ attitudes toward same-sex adoption.
This is a significant oversight since, to a large degree, cultural, political, and legal debates
surrounding same-sex marriage are increasingly centered on the (often adopted) children of such
unions (Briggs, 2012; Clarke, 2001; Rosenfeld, 2007), with religious groups at the forefront of
the debate (Briggs, 2012; Wilson, 2004). Indeed, feminist historian Laura Briggs (2012)
contends, “[Gay adoption] has become [the defining issue in the gay and lesbian freedom
movement]—to a significant extent the question of gay marriage is centrally about the raising of

1

children, for its supporters among LGBT folk, for its Christian Right opponents, and even for the
judges writing decisions about it” (241).
Among the few studies that include religion measures in their analysis of support for gay
and lesbian adoption, little effort is made to understand exactly how religious factors such as
religious tradition, practices, and beliefs shape public opinion toward such adoptions. There is
also little attempt to understand which religious factors matter most and the substantive
significance of those factors relative to other relevant correlates. Rather, within the vast majority
of studies that include religious predictors of support for same-sex adoption, the measures are
only included as control variables in multivariate models, and thus, never receive sufficient
analytical attention. Moreover, due to data limitations, the religion measures that are used are
typically sparse and over-aggregated, yielding limited information about the relationship
between religious life and Americans’ views toward same-sex adoptive families. As a result,
previous research on this topic potentially omits important nuance and insight with respect to
how various dimensions of religious life, in all its complexity, shapes attitudes toward same-sex
adoptions and which factors are of central importance.
The current study fills this gap in the literature on attitudes toward same-sex adoption in
two important ways. First, we include a more comprehensive battery of religion measures,
including religious affiliations, various religious practices, and beliefs about the Bible, in order to
examine the net effects of religious factors on support for same-sex adoption, while controlling
for relevant socio-demographic and ideological factors. And second, we compute standardized
logistic regression coefficients in order to examine which predictors of support for same-sex
adoption matter more than others. This research thus contributes to the literature on public

2

opinion toward same-sex families by providing greater insight into the substantive significance
of religious factors for explaining Americans’ attitudes toward same-sex adoptive families.
Religion and Attitudes toward Same-Sex Romantic and Family Relationships
A growing amount of research focuses on the social and ideological correlates of support
for same-sex romantic and family relationships. Drawing from a variety of data sources,
researchers consistently find that persons who are more supportive of same-sex intimate
relationships tend to be younger, female, non-Southern, urban, politically liberal, more educated,
more exposed to diversity, less religious, and hold to the belief that homosexuality is innate, not
a choice (Adamczyk & Pitt, 2009; Burdette et al., 2005; Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2008; Olson et
al., 2006; Perry, 2013a, 2013b; Petersen & Donnenwerth, 1998; Whitehead, 2010).
Among these predictors of attitudes toward same-sex intimacy, religious factors—most
often religious affiliation and church attendance, and less frequently, views about the Bible—
tend to be among the strongest predictors of attitudes toward gay civil rights both in the United
States and abroad. Conservative Protestants tend to be the least supportive of same-sex romantic
relationships (Andersen & Fetner, 2008; Lubbers et al., 2009; Olson et al., 2006; Sherkat et al.,
2011; Whitehead, 2013), and others have found that Muslims also tend to express opposition to
such relationships (Adamczyk & Pitt, 2010). By contrast, mainline Protestants, Jews, and the
religiously unaffiliated tend to be more supportive of gay and lesbian relationships (Besen and
Zicklin, 2007; Perry, 2013a, 2013b). Beyond religious affiliation, religious belief is associated
with attitudes toward homosexuality as well. Individuals who hold traditional religious beliefs
(e.g., “The Bible should be read literally, word for word”) are consistently less supportive of
homosexuality or gay civil rights (Burdette et al., 2005; Froese et al., 2008; Hill et al., 2004;
Sherkat et al., 2010; Sherkat et al., 2011; Whitehead, 2010).

3

The effect of church attendance—generally used as a proxy for “religiosity,” religious
devotion, or religious practice—also receives consistent support. A number of studies report a
significant net effect of church attendance on opposition to same-sex couples and families
(Andersen & Fetner, 2008; Lubbers et al., 2009; Olson et al., 2006; Sherkat et al., 2010;
Whitehead, 2010). Accounting for this effect, it is likely through regular interaction at worship
services with other like-minded individuals that the plausibility structures that undergird attitudes
toward various issues, like homosexuality or adoption by same-sex couples, are constructed and
maintained (Berger, 1967; Petersen & Donnenwerth, 1998). Participation in religious institutions
can even influence gays and lesbians to support same-sex marriage at lower levels (Baiocco,
Argalia, and Laghi, 2012). One weakness of how the majority of these studies operationalize
religious behavior is their reliance on religious service attendance only. For many individuals it
may be that religious service attendance is much less important while other types of religious
behavior like reading sacred scriptures or devotional prayer play a primary role (Ellison,
Wolfinger, and Ramos-Wada, 2013; Lubbers et al., 2009).
Some studies find that the effects of religious belief, behavior, and affiliation on attitudes
toward homosexuality moderate one another (Burdette et al., 2005; Ellison & Musick, 1993;
Schulte and Battle, 2004). These findings encourage the inclusion of multiple measures of
religion into each analysis to identify which aspects of religion are more closely associated with
attitudes toward “morality issues” as broadly construed in public rhetoric, like homosexuality or
same-sex adoption (Ellison et al., 2013; Lubbers et al., 2009). Whitehead (2010, p. 74) makes the
case that when investigating attitudes toward moral issues “it is not enough to account for just
one aspect of religiosity” as a measure of the effect of religion. In the current analysis multiple

4

measures of religion (belief, behavior, and affiliation), in effect, triangulate the effect of religion
as a whole on respondents’ attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples.
We situate the findings of prior research on religion and attitudes toward homosexuality
and our analysis of religion’s effect on attitudes toward same-sex adoption in the theoretical
framework of structuration theory drawing on the concept of “schemas.” Introduced by Giddens
(1984) and elaborated by Sewell (2005), structuration theory maintains that structures denote the
tendency of patterns of relations to be reproduced even when actors engaging in them are
unaware of the patterns or even when they do not desire their reproduction. Structures shape
actors’ practices but it is also these practices that comprise and reproduce structures (Sewell,
2005). Structures, therefore, do not simply constrain behavior but also enable it; there is a duality
of structure. Structures are composed of both schemas (or “rules” according to Giddens) and
resources. Resources are “anything that can serve as a source of power in social interactions”
(Sewell, 2005, p. 132). Schemas pattern practices and are “generalizable procedures applied in
the enactment/reproduction of social life” (Sewell, 2005, p. 131). They serve as templates or
rules for acting in the social world. A key quality of schemas is that they are transposable
(Sewell, 2005). This transposability allows for their application to new situations and contexts.
The concept of schemas and their transposable nature helps explicate the relationship
between religious belief and attitudes toward same-sex adoption, and by extension religious
affiliation and same-sex adoption attitudes. Biblical literalists and Evangelical Protestants are
much more likely to oppose same-sex adoption due to the schemas directing their actions toward
homosexuality generally. These schemas are predicated on their interpretation of specific biblical
passages that in their interpretation explicitly oppose any type of same-sex intimacy.1 The
transposable nature of schemas allows biblical literalists and Evangelical Protestants to apply this

5

particular schema to adoption by same-sex couples. Biblical literalists and Evangelicals also
valorize the idea of the “traditional family,” another schema, which is assumed to be made up of
a man and wife with their biological children (Denton, 2004; Gallagher, 2002; Gallagher &
Smith, 1999; Hoffmann & Bartkowski, 2008). Same-sex couples would obviously violate this
ideal, leading Evangelicals and biblical literalists to oppose their adoption of children. The
concept of schemas has proven useful in prior studies examining religion’s influence on various
social attitudes and outcomes (Denton, 2004; Edgell, Gerteis, and Hartmann, 2006; Hoffmann
and Bartkowski, 2008; Miller and Hoffmann, 1999; Sherkat, 1998).
Religion and Attitudes toward Same-Sex Adoption
Despite the now enormous amount of research that focuses on the social correlates of
support for gay and lesbian romantic relationships, relatively little research highlights support for
same-sex adoption explicitly. This is likely for at least two reasons. First, the majority of legal
controversy surrounding same-sex relationships is ostensibly about whether or not society should
legally recognize the romantic unions of gay and lesbian couples. In this sense, same-sex
adoption is viewed as a subsidiary to this broader issue. And second, researchers neglect to
recognize the ways in which same-sex adoption is a different type of relationship than same-sex
romantic unions, both in terms of the legal status awarded to each2 and the inherent power
differentials.3 Consequently, studies of public opinion regarding gay and lesbian relationships
often combine measures of support for same-sex adoption and marriage together (e.g., Schulte &
Battle, 2004; van den Akker et al., 2013). As a result, there are relatively few studies that give
overt attention to the various social and ideological factors that shape Americans’ views toward
same-sex adoption.

6

Among the few exceptions, similar to research regarding support for same-sex romantic
relationships, the majority of these studies utilize church attendance and religious tradition as
measures of religious life. However, the influence of religious factors is not the focus of these
studies, and researchers never specify hypotheses regarding the effects of religion measures.
MacLeod and his colleagues (1999) studied a group of heterosexual college students and found
that more frequent church attendance was weakly associated with students believing that the
adopted child of a gay male parent would benefit from custody reassignment and would suffer
from sexual orientation and gender confusion if s/he remained with the gay parent. These
findings washed out in multivariate models, however, likely due to the sample size (N = 77).
Using a larger sample of 364 college students, Lambert et al. (2006) found that students who
attended church more often were less likely to agree that gay/lesbian parents should be allowed
to adopt. Church attendance, however, was not associated with students’ attitudes toward
gay/lesbian foster parents, and students’ self-reported importance of religion was not associated
with their views regarding gay/lesbian adoption or foster parenting. Drawing upon a random
sample of 413 registered voters in Florida, Ryan et al. (2004) found that Floridians who
identified as Christian held a significantly lower opinion of gay and lesbian adoptive parents than
persons who did not espouse Christian faith, net of other factors. Using the same data, the
authors (2007) later reported that being a Christian was highly predictive of a Floridian voter
opposing a boy or girl being legally adopted by a lesbian or gay parent. More recently, Averett
and her colleagues (2011) studied the attitudes of 776 adoptive parents toward gay and lesbian
adoption, finding membership in a Christian denomination was associated with negative attitudes
toward gay and lesbian adopters among married adoptive fathers and mothers, but not adoptive

7

singles, and greater religiosity (church attendance and prayer frequency) was associated with
lower levels of support for gay and lesbian adoption among all adoptive parents.
Although these studies provide some empirical foundation for generating hypotheses
regarding the relationship between religion and support for same-sex adoption, their findings are
limited in that they are based on either convenience samples or sub-populations (college
students, Florida voters, adoptive parents); their samples are rather small; and their measures of
religious tradition (Christian vs. other) or religious practice are somewhat narrow. Drawing upon
data from a national probability sample, Besen and Zicklin (2007) reported that persons who are
“born again Christians” (broadly, Evangelical) or Roman Catholic are less likely to support gay
adoption. They also found an interaction between gender and religiosity with more religious
males being even less likely to support gay adoption than those who are less religious or female.
Also using national-level data, Perry (2013a) included a number of religion measures to predict
support for same-sex sexuality, marriage, and adoption. He found that, net of other factors,
Catholics, mainline Protestants, and persons of “other” religious faiths were all more likely than
Evangelical Protestants to support same-sex adoption. Black Protestants, however, were no more
likely than Evangelicals to support such adoptions. He also found that persons who more
frequently engaged in religious practices and strict biblical literalists were both relatively less
likely to support same-sex adoption. Perry’s measure of biblical literalism, however, was limited
to a dichotomous measure (literalist vs. other) and thus was likely over-aggregated. Moreover,
his analyses did not include the strongest predictor of support for same-sex relationships,
attribution (homosexuality innate or by choice), which may have biased his findings.
Hypotheses

8

Building upon findings from previous research regarding the link between religious
factors, homosexuality, and support for same-sex adoption specifically, we formulate the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Evangelical Protestants will be less supportive of same-sex adoption than
all other religious or non-religious groups.
Hypothesis 2: Persons who more frequently engage in religious activities (including
religious service attendance, prayer, and sacred text reading) will be less supportive of
same-sex adoption.
Hypothesis 3: Persons who are strict biblical literalists will be less supportive of samesex adoption than persons who hold different beliefs about the Bible.
An additional strength of our study is that we are able to compare the substantive net
effects of each religion measure on support for same-sex adoption. Based on previous research
suggesting the primary importance of religious practices and beliefs over and against religious
affiliation (Burdette et al., 2005; Ellison & Musick, 1993; Schulte & Battle, 2004), we predict:
Hypothesis 4: The net effects of religious practices and theological conservatism will
have a stronger influence on support for same-sex adoption than religious affiliation.
Data
Data for these analyses are drawn from the third wave (2010) of the Baylor Religion
Survey (BRS). The 2010 BRS is a random, national sample of 1,714 U.S. citizens administered
by the Gallup Organization. The survey utilized a mixed-mode sampling design consisting of
two phases. Both phases resulted in a total of 3,500 individuals screened and 2,556 possible
respondents. A total of 1,714 questionnaires were returned resulting in a response rate of 49%
[1,714/3,500] among all individuals screened and a response rate of 67% [1,714/2,556] for those
who agreed to receive a mailed survey. Previous BRS data compare favorably to other national
surveys (Bader, Mencken, & Froese, 2007) and comparisons between the 2010 BRS and the
2010 GSS are available upon request. The 2010 BRS is useful for the existing research question
9

because it contains a breadth of religion measures as well as questions pertaining to attitudes
toward adoption by same-sex couples and various other socio-demographic controls. The
combination of these variables is not found in any other large, national random survey.
Dependent Variable
The dependent variable for this study focuses on respondents’ views toward adoption by
same-sex couples. The question utilized asks: “How do you feel about the morality of the
following? Adoption of children by homosexual couples.”4 Possible responses include “Always
wrong,” “Almost always wrong,” “Only wrong sometimes,” and “Not wrong at all.” In order to
predict which respondents report unequivocal support for adoption by same-sex couples, this
variable was recoded such that 1 = Not wrong at all, with all other responses recoded as 0. Close
to 40 percent of Americans declare clear support for adoption by same-sex couples (see Table 1).
Independent Variables of Interest
In order to provide a more complete picture of religion’s relationship with attitudes
toward same-sex adoption, we utilize a collection of religion measures that offer greater breadth
and depth than those found in past research. Previous analyses measured religious affiliation
using a “Christian” versus “Other” dichotomy (Averett et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2004, 2007).
However, Steensland and colleagues (2001) demonstrate that there are seven distinct religious
traditions operating in the United States and individuals’ affiliation with these traditions predicts
their views on a number of outcomes. Their RELTRAD typology categorizes all religious groups
into seven distinct categories: Evangelical Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Black Protestant,5
Catholic, Jewish, other, and no affiliation.6 This analysis follows the RELTRAD coding strategy
and places all respondents into each of these categories. Because prior research consistently finds

10

Evangelical Protestants the most opposed to homosexuality and gay rights, we exclude them as
the contrast category.
In order to measure religious behavior this analysis includes three different measures:
frequency of prayer/meditation, frequency of religious service attendance, and frequency of
reading sacred scriptures. The items for reading sacred scriptures and religious service
attendance range from 1 = Never to 9 = Several times a week. The item concerning prayer ranges
from 1 = Never to 6 = Several times a day. A benefit of including these three measures of
religious behavior is that they account for both public (religious service attendance) and private
(prayer/meditation, reading sacred scriptures) activities.
In addition to religious affiliation and religious behavior, these analyses also incorporate
respondents’ religious beliefs. One widely used measure of religious belief is the degree to which
individuals believe the Bible should be read literally. A question in the 2010 BRS asked, “Which
one statement comes closest to your personal beliefs about the Bible?” Possible responses were
“The Bible means exactly what it says. It should be taken literally, word-for-word, on all
subjects;” “The Bible is perfectly true, but it should not be taken literally, word-for-word. We
must interpret its meaning;” “The Bible contains some human error;” “The Bible is an ancient
book of history and legends;” and “I don’t know.” We recoded this measure to create a series of
dichotomous variables. Because biblical literalists tend to be most opposed to homosexuality and
gay rights, we exclude them as the contrast category in the full model. We perform additional
analyses (reported below) where we rotate each of the other views of the Bible into the reference
category position.
Control Variables

11

Building upon past studies analyzing attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples, this
study includes a host of socio-demographic and ideological controls. The socio-demographic
measures include age (in years), gender (1 = Female), race (1 = Non-white), marital status (1 =
married), region (1 = South), size of city (1 = urban), educational attainment (1 = 8th grade or
less to 7 = postgraduate work/degree), and income (1 = $10,000 or less to 7 = $150,000 or more).
Ideological controls include political ideology (1 = Extremely Liberal to 7 = Extremely
Conservative), and whether the respondent believes homosexuality is innate (1 = Innate).
[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
Methods
Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for all of the measures utilized in this analysis. It
also includes the bivariate associations between the dependent variable and each of the
independent variables. Table 2 displays the various multivariate models. Due to the dichotomous
coding of the dependent variable logistic regression is utilized. The first model contains only the
socio-demographic factors. Model 2 includes the RELTRAD typology. Model 3 adds the
religious practice measures while Model 4 includes the biblical literalism series of dichotomous
variables. Models 5 and 6 include political conservatism and belief that homosexuality is innate,
respectively.7 All of the variables included in the final models except religious tradition and
region had missing information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used to correct for missing data
(Rubin, 1987).8 To allow for the interpretation of substantive significance alongside statistical
∗
significance, standardized coefficients for the logistic regression models were estimated [𝐵𝑦𝑥
=

𝑏𝑦𝑥 (𝑠𝑥 /𝑠𝑦 )] (Pampel, 2000).9 Table 3 displays the results of rotating the excluded category for
the biblical literalism series of dichotomous variables. Doing so allows for an examination of
how each distinct response differs from every other response. Table 3 does not display the

12

standardized coefficients for the other religion and control variables in order to focus specifically
on the relationships between the discrete categories on the biblical literalism measure. There are
no substantive or statistical differences for the control and other religion variables between
Model 6 displayed in Table 2 and Models 5 through 8 displayed in Table 3.10
Results
In Table 1 we find that 38.3 percent of Americans fully support adoption by same-sex
couples. We also find strong correlations between the various religion measures and support for
adoption by same-sex couples. Individuals who practice their religion regularly, read the bible
literally, believe the bible is perfectly true but must be interpreted, or are Evangelical Protestants
are much more likely to oppose adoption by same-sex couples. Those who believe the bible
contains human error, believe the bible is an ancient book full of history and legend, do not know
what they believe about the bible, or are unaffiliated with a religious tradition are more
supportive of adoption by same-sex couples.
Table 2 presents the multivariate analyses. Model 1 contains the socio-demographic
controls. Consistent with previous research, older adults, married adults, and those from the
South are all less supportive of adoption by same-sex couples. Being female, living in an urban
area, and increasing levels of education and income are all predictive of greater support for
adoption by same-sex couples.
Model 2 includes the RELTRAD typology of religious affiliation. Net of all the effects of
the relevant control variables, only the religiously unaffiliated are significantly different from
Evagelical Protestants. The unaffiliated are much more likely to support adoption by same-sex
couples compared to Evangelicals, with odds 2.26 times greater. The net effects of the control
variables remain largely unchanged from Model 1 to Model 2. Model 3 incorporates three

13

measures of religious practice. Individuals who practice their religion more frequently by reading
sacred scriptures or attending religious services are much more likely to oppose same-sex
adoption. Frequency of prayer, however, is not significantly associated with attitudes toward
same-sex adoption. When religious behavior is included in the model the difference between the
unaffiliated and Evangelicals is largely attenuated, but not completely. Controlling for public and
private religious behavior does account for the statistical significance of region of the country in
prior models. Identical to Models 1 and 2, age, gender, marital status, education level, income,
and size of place all maintain their previous associations.
Model 4 includes the biblical literalism measures. As predicted, individuals who read the
Bible literally are much more likely to oppose adoption by same-sex couples compared to all the
other groups. Also as expected, even when controlling for views of the Bible, attendance at
religious services and frequency of Bible reading are still negatively and significantly related to
views toward same-sex adoption. With religious beliefs and practices accounted for in the model,
there are now no significant differences between Evangelicals and every other religious tradition
on support for same-sex adoption. Model 5 introduces a measure of political conservatism which
is significantly and negatively associated with support for adoption by same-sex couples.
Model 6 includes a measure of whether respondents’ believe homosexuality is innate (not
a choice) and represents the full model. Believing homosexuality is innate is a robust and
significant predictor of support for same-sex adoption. Regarding our variables of interest, in the
full model, the odds of supporting same-sex adoption for those who interpret the Bible are 1.71
times greater than biblical literalists. Similarly, the odds of supporting same-sex adoption for
those who believe the Bible contains errors or that it is a book full of history and legends are
three times and 2.38 times greater, respectively. The odds of supporting adoption by same-sex

14

couples for those who do not know what they believe about the Bible are 1.86 times greater than
biblical literalists. Frequent attendance at religious services and frequent reading of sacred
scriptures are each negatively and significantly associated with support of same-sex adoption.
Frequency of prayer, however, is not. There continue to be no significant differences between
conservative Protestants and every other religious tradition. Age, gender, marital status,
education, income, and political ideology all maintain their previous associations.
Substantively, political conservatism (β = -0.58) and believing homosexuality is innate (β
= 0.39) are the two strongest predictors in the full model. The standardized effect of the
difference between biblical literalists and those who believe the Bible contains errors is the third
strongest predictor (β = 0.20), along with the differences between biblical literalists and those
who believe the Bible is an ancient book (β = 0.20). Age is the fourth strongest predictor (β = 0.18) followed by the difference between biblical literalists and those who interpret the Bible (β
= 0.14) and marital status (β = -0.14). Frequency of attending religious services (β = -0.12) and
reading sacred scriptures (β = -0.11) are the next strongest predictors. These findings strongly
suggest that, when predicting attitudes toward same-sex adoption, religious factors are quite
important. Yet, as predicted in our fourth hypothesis, knowing where an individual worships
(e.g., an Evangelical, Catholic, or Mainline church, or no church) is not as important as knowing
how often they practice both publically and privately or the types of beliefs they hold.
[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Table 3 provides a more comprehensive examination of how the different views of the
Bible relate to support for adoption by same-sex couples. The first column, model 4, shows
biblical literalists as the contrast category which is identical to model 4 from Table 2 and whose
results were discussed above. Individuals who believe the Bible is perfectly true but it requires

15

interpretation are the contrast category in model 5. The odds of supporting adoption for biblical
literalists decrease 72 percent compared to interpreters.11 The odds for those who believe the
Bible contains errors are 78 percent greater compared to interpreters. There are no significant
differences between interpreters and those who believe the Bible is an ancient book, or those
who do not know what they believe about the Bible. In model 6 those who believe the Bible
contains errors are the contrast category. The odds of biblical literalists and interpreters
supporting adoption by same-sex couples are 2.9 and 1.7 times less than those who believe the
Bible contains errors. There are no significant differences between those who view the Bible as
an ancient book, are undecided about their view of the Bible, and those who believe the Bible
contains errors. In model 7 we find that the only significant difference for those who believe the
Bible is an ancient book is with biblical literalists, whose odds are 2.3 times smaller. There are
no significant differences for those who believe the Bible is an ancient book and interpreters,
believing the Bible contains errors, and the undecided. Finally, model 8 focuses on those who are
unsure of their view of the Bible. Regarding support for adoption by same-sex couples, there are
no significant differences between this group and every other view of the Bible.

Discussion and Conclusions
The results from this analysis demonstrate religion’s strong and multifaceted association
with attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples. While previous studies generally relied on
over-aggregated measures of religious affiliation or used a single measure of religious behavior
in worship service attendance, only by using a more complete array of religion measures does the
true nature of the relationship between religion and same-sex adoption attitudes stand out. First,
individuals who practice their religion more frequently by reading sacred scriptures or attending

16

worship services are much more likely to oppose same-sex adoption. However, one private
religious behavior, prayer, is not significantly associated with attitudes toward adoption by samesex couples. While it is through both public and private religious practice that individuals’
plausibility structures are constructed and preserved and their attitudes toward adoption by samesex couples formed and sustained (Berger, 1967; Petersen & Donnenwerth, 1998), not all
religious behavior portends opposition toward adoption by same-sex couples. Accounting for this
difference, religious service attendance and sacred text reading both expose adherents to
traditional religious teachings on family relationships, and consequently, traditionalist schemas
opposing homosexuality. In contrast, prayer is often done in private, and does not imply
exposure to anti-homosexuality schemas. The non-significant effect of prayer frequency on
support for same-sex adoption suggests that it is not religious devotion per se that inclines
persons to oppose same-sex family forms, but inculcation with religio-cultural schemas that
denounce such relationships. Biblical literalists, compared to those who believe the Bible should
be interpreted, that it contains errors, that it is an ancient book of legends, or who are unsure of
what they believe about the Bible, are also much more likely to oppose adoption by same-sex
couples. Biblical literalists appear to be much more likely to apply passages concerning
homosexuality to the present day (Burdette et al., 2005; Froese et al., 2008; Hill et al., 2004;
Sherkat et al., 2010; Sherkat et al., 2011; Whitehead, 2010). Their schemas concerning
homosexuality and the traditional family transpose onto the issue of adoption by same-sex
couples.
This analysis also makes clear that once religious practice and religious belief are
accounted for, the differences between Evangelical Protestants and the unaffiliated disappear.
When considering attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples, religious behavior and

17

religious belief are most important while the differences between religious affiliations fade to the
background. Our models suggest that the differences observed between Evangelical Protestants
and the unaffiliated regarding support for same-sex families are due to their (obvious) underlying
differences in religious behavior and Bible beliefs. The overall lack of effects of religious
tradition could also be due to nominal affiliation patterns by those who claim to affiliate but are
relatively inactive in the tradition. While religious traditions exhibit no significant differences in
the attitudes individuals hold toward same-sex adoption in multivariate models, those influences
are possibly channeled through the schemas, religious beliefs, and behaviors the religious
traditions tend to encourage. Future analyses could utilize structural equation modeling to test if
religious tradition has an indirect effect on attitudes toward same-sex adoption.
An even finer-grained analysis of Bible beliefs reveals more interesting findings. First,
there is a definitive separation between biblical literalists and all other possible views of the
Bible concerning views toward same-sex adoption. However, differences also exist between the
other views of the Bible. Those who interpret the Bible are more likely to support same-sex
adoption compared to biblical literalists, even though they still hold the Bible in very high
regard, but are less likely to support adoption by same-sex couples compared to those who
believe the Bible contains errors. Interpreters occupy a middle-ground between on this issue
between biblical literalists and less traditional views of the Bible. These groups appear to
approach this issue through different sets of schemas. This is an important finding when
considering that over a third of Americans (34.5%) support a view of the Bible that encourages
interpretation, by far the largest group (see Table 1). Substantively, we find that in addition to
Bible beliefs and behavior being the most important religious predictors of attitudes toward
same-sex adoption, they are also among the most important predictors in the entire model. Future

18

research examining attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples must account for the
multifaceted nature of religion. Only accounting for religious affiliation, or religious service
attendance, may overlook the complex influence of religion as a whole.
A number of additional findings warrant discussion. First, political views are consistently
the strongest predictor of attitudes toward same-sex adoption. This finding is in line with prior
research that highlights the importance of political ideology on attitudes toward homosexuality
generally, and same-sex unions specifically (Hill et al., 2004; Sherkat et al., 2011). The beliefs
individuals have about the cause of homosexuality are also strongly associated with views of
same-sex adoption. Various studies point out that believing homosexuality is a choice or an
innate characteristic informs individuals’ views toward the rights that should be afforded gays
and lesbians (Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2008; Whitehead, 2010). However, attribution beliefs in
past research on attitudes toward homosexuality and same-sex unions are consistently the
strongest variables in the model (Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2008; Whitehead, 2010). When
considering attitudes toward same-sex adoptions, however, attribution beliefs are second to
political views. This suggests that an individual’s political views influence her attitudes toward
same-sex adoption more so than whether they believe sexuality is an innate characteristic or not.
The consistent negative association between marital status and support of adoption by
same-sex couples stands out as well. Married individuals are much less likely than the unmarried
to endorse the building of families by same-sex couples. Individuals with stakes in conformity
and a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, which past theorists assume married
individuals have, are less likely to favor any changes that might provide an alternative to their
current situation (Burdette et al., 2005; Hill et al., 2004; McVeigh & Diaz, 2009; Powell et al.,
2010). Marriage could also operate as a type of plausibility structure where more traditional

19

beliefs toward family life become solidified (Berger, 1969). The effects of age, gender,
education, income, and region follow expectations drawn from past literature on attitudes toward
same-sex sexuality, legal unions, and adoption (Andersen & Fetner, 2008; Averett et al., 2009;
Ryan et al., 2007; Sherkat et al., 2010; Sherkat et al., 2011; Whitehead, 2010).
Several limitations of the analysis must be mentioned. First, due to the cross-sectional
nature of the 2010 BRS, causal direction cannot be determined. It may be that individuals’ views
toward same-sex adoption influence their interpretation of the Bible, or how often they attend
religious services, or pray. Nevertheless, past research supports the theoretical progression we
identify in this study that for most individuals, religious beliefs and practices occupy a central
position in their lives that serves to influence their views on a number of issues. Second, the
dependent variable does not distinguish between attitudes toward “gay couples” and “lesbian
couples.” Despite this weakness, public rhetoric surrounding gays and lesbians tends to focus on
homosexuality as a whole. Social movements both supporting and opposing gay rights tend to
either seek equality for both gays and lesbians or oppose them equally (Herek 2002). In this way,
the dependent variable does measure a portion of this larger set of attitudes held by many (see
footnote 4). Finally, future research could use structural equation models to tease out the
relationships among the religious and political factors, which the step-wise multivariate models
in this analysis are largely unable to do (see Sherkat et al. 2010, Sherkat et al. 2011).
Despite these limitations, this study advances the literature on attitudes toward adoption
by same-sex couples in two important ways. First, it provides a comprehensive look at the
multifaceted effects of religious belief, behavior, and affiliation. How individuals view the Bible
and how often they practice their religion both publically and privately can tell researchers a
great deal about how they will view same-sex adoption. Where a person worships matters much

20

less. Second, this analysis shows that the effects of religious belief and behavior are among the
strongest influences on a person’s beliefs, net of all other possible effects. While political
orientation and an individual’s view of the cause of homosexuality exhibit the strongest
associations with attitudes toward same-sex adoption, taken together, the combined effects of
religion on an individual’s views of adoption by same-sex couples is of central importance. As
the legal recognition of various family structures are debated, religion will continue to influence
and inform the attitudes of the public and the policy-makers. Understanding the multifaceted
effect of religion on American adults is an essential element in comprehending their views
toward adoption by same-sex couples.
Beyond the research implications of our study, the results presented here clarify for gay
and lesbian couples seeking to adopt the sources of religious opposition. Our findings suggest
that religious men and women tend to oppose the adoption of children by same-sex couples not
because of religious affiliations or even personal religious devotion, but more likely because of
greater inculcation with religio-cultural schemas (found in particular congregations and sacred
Scriptures) that oppose same-sex relationships. Thus, for the gay community, attenuating this
opposition would not necessarily require the denouncement of religious adherence per se, but
rather an engagement with faith communities, providing countervailing narratives and
encouraging such communities to embrace their deeper teachings about tolerance, equality, and
love. Research on the importance of interpersonal contact with gays and lesbians for increasing
support for gay rights suggests that engagement with faith communities may have positive
results (Rosenfeld, 2007).

For example: Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.
Same-sex romantic unions have been the focus of more explicit legal sanction than same-sex
adoption. At the time of this writing, full marriage between same-sex partners is legal in 13 states
and the District of Columbia, with civil unions being granted in another five states. A full 35
states prohibit full same-sex marriage by statute or in their constitutions, with 17 of these
banning both same-sex marriage and civil unions. By contrast, only two states (Mississippi and
Utah) have laws that explicitly prohibit same-sex couples from adopting. Twenty-one states and
the District of Columbia allow for same-sex couples to jointly petition to adopt statewide while
18 states and the District of Columbia allow for second-parent adoption. A handful of other
states, however, create obstacles for same-sex parents interested in adopting that hinge on the
fact that they cannot be legally married in these states (Human Rights Campaign, 2013).
3
For example, same-sex romantic relationships occur between social and legal peers who, under
normal circumstances, both voluntarily agree to enter into a relationship. Same-sex adoption, by
contrast, involves a different power dynamic between two adults and a minor child who
(depending on their age at adoption) had little to no choice on her/his adoptive parents.
Relatedly, because of the power dynamic, the direction of influence in same-sex adoption is
more unilateral (parents → child(ren)) compared to influence in a same-sex romantic relationship
(partner ↔ partner). Lastly, while there is typically no developmental or financial need for an
adult to be in a romantic relationship, minor children are vulnerable and in need of care and
support for healthy development, and thus, require being placed in the care of legal guardians of
some form.
4 A weakness of this measure is that it asks for respondent’s attitudes toward “homosexual
couples” instead of either “gay couples” or “lesbian couples.” Prior research shows that when
asking about attitudes toward “homosexuality” the stronger negative reaction that gay men
receive overwhelms the less negative reaction that lesbians generally receive, leading to more
negative reactions to homosexuality in general (Herek, 2002; Kite & Whitley, 1996). While
specifically asking about “gay couples” or “lesbian couples” is ideal, Herek (2002) points out
that public rhetoric commonly utilizes “homosexuality” with no distinction between gay men and
lesbians. Likewise, most groups opposed to homosexuality do not distinguish between gay men
and lesbians. The lack of distinction between gay men and lesbians is true for the gay movement
as well; they desire equality for both. Herek (2002:42) points out that in the public discourse gay
men and lesbians share a “common characteristic that makes them members of a distinct quasiethnic group with its own culture and political concerns.” This means that while the question
used cannot distinguish between attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, it does measure an
aspect of the broader attitudes maintained by a majority of the public.

The RELTRAD typology recommended by Steensland et al. (2000) categorizes Black
Protestants using historically black denominations. However, doing so misses a great deal of
variation within Black Protestantism, as Sherkat and colleagues show (2010). While we follow a
wealth of past research that uses the RELTRAD typology, readers should interpret these results
with caution.

Due to the number of religion variables in the full model we performed collinearity diagnostics.
Despite the correlation between the religion measures, multicollinearity does not appear to be
adversely affecting the models. Also, the maximum likelihood estimation procedure used in the
logistic regression models in these analyses is less susceptible to issues arising from
multicollinearity compared to standard ordinary least squares techniques.

The MI procedure generates five imputations using multiple Markov Chains based on all
variables included in each model, resulting in an overall N of 8,570 (1,714 X 5). All results use
the MI dataset. The correlations reported in Table 1 and all of the results reported in Tables 2 and
3 are from the MIANALYZE procedure in SAS. This procedure combines all of the results from
each of the five imputations resulting in overall estimates, standard errors, and significance
levels. The standardized coefficients and odds ratios for each model were calculated using these
overall estimates. The Proportional Reduction in Error (PRE) reported in Table 2 for each model
are the average of the PRE for each individual iteration.

This analysis follows Pampel’s (2000) assumption that the standard deviation of logit(y) =
1.8138.

This analysis also tested for a host of moderating effects and interactions between the religion
measures themselves, and between the religion measures and the socio-demographic control
variables. However, no significant interactions were present. Further detail on which interactions
were tested is available from the authors.

In order to calculate the percent change in odds for the measures with negative odds ratios, 1 is
divided by each ratio. This corrects for negative odds ratios being bounded between 0 and 1.
Thus, biblical literalists = 1/0.58 = 1.72.
