Abstract

22	  

Background: Populations in coastal cities are exposed to increasing risk of flooding,

23	  

resulting in rising damages to health and assets. Local adaptation measures, such as early

24	  

warning systems for floods (EWSFs), are urgently needed to reduce the risk and impact

25	  

of flood events. The aim of this study was to assess community perceptions and self-

26	  

reported actions in response to flooding in a tropical coastal city to inform flood risk

27	  

reduction policies and programs.

28	  

Methods: This qualitative case study was conducted in flood-prone areas in Machala,

29	  

Ecuador, a coastal city exposed to seasonal floods and extreme floods during El Niño

30	  

events. Adult community members from three periurban sites were invited to participate.

31	  

Focus groups discussions (11 focus groups in total) were held with community members

32	  

(n=65 people) from September to November 2014 to assess perceptions of flood

33	  

exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Focus groups

34	  

discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic; participatory maps

35	  

were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software.

36	  

Results: Community members identified the presence of annual flooding during the rainy

37	  

season, as well as greater than normal flood events (depths ranging from 0.5 to 3 meters),

38	  

which recurred every 3-4 years in some communities. The deepest floods occurred during

39	  

the 1982 and 1997/1998 El Niño events. Community members perceived that exposure to

40	  

flooding depended on the rainfall coinciding with high ocean tides, and geographic

41	  

proximity to blocked drainage areas, canals, and low local elevation. Participants reported

42	  

that children were the most sensitive group due to increased susceptibility to skin

43	  

infections and mosquito borne diseases (i.e., dengue fever). Other sensitive groups

2

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
44	  

included the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent

45	  

migrants. They identified persistent social-ecological vulnerabilities that increased flood

46	  

risk and exposure in the urban periphery, such as inadequate access to garbage collection,

47	  

homes settled in precarious low-lying geographies, economic barriers, lack of political

48	  

access, and lack of social mobilization. In addition, communities expressed a lack of

49	  

social capital (e.g. political voice), despite the existence of formalized community

50	  

councils. Key neighborhood resources with respect to flooding included green areas,

51	  

schools, nurseries, fire stations, health clinics, police stations, a retention wall (berm), and

52	  

an emergency meeting place. Challenges for adaptive capacity existed primarily in

53	  

actions related to the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Despite the presence of

54	  

an official flood warning system, community member relied on informal communication

55	  

channels via social media.

56	  

Conclusions: The flood vulnerability assessment framework and participatory research

57	  

process utilized here can potentially inform studies in other flood-prone regions to guide

58	  

the development of EWSFs and other climate change adaptation policies and actions.

Author summary

61	  

Flooding is a major concern in coastal cities, causing damages to people’s health and

62	  

property. Many countries have identified the need for early warning systems for floods

63	  

(EWSFs) and other actions to reduce the impact of flooding. However, it has been

64	  

challenging to implement these systems without an understanding of the local social-

65	  

ecological context, including people’s perceptions and experience with flooding. In this

66	  

case study, we explored community perceptions of flooding in high-risk urban

3

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
67	  

neighborhoods in southern Ecuador. Homes were at greatest risk of flooding if they were

68	  

located near clogged drainage canals, low-lying properties, and flood-prone canals.

69	  

Children were most affected by flooding, due to the risk of infectious diseases.

70	  

Communities had difficulty preventing floods and recovering from floods due to factors

71	  

such as lack of leadership, lack of social mobilization, limited household finances, and

72	  

lack of coordination with local government authorities. Despite an official EWSF,

73	  

community members reported using social media and other informal communication

74	  

channels to receive local flood alerts. Based on these findings, we identify key

75	  

considerations to improve EWSFs.

Introduction

79	  

Damages due to flooding are increasing in urban areas [1,2] due to increased

80	  

population and assets, a changing climate [3], coastal subsidence [4–6], and deforestation

81	  

[7,8]. Global flood losses in coastal cities are projected to increase from $6 billion per

82	  

year in 2005 to $52 billion a year by 2050 [9]. When damages due to sea-level rise and

83	  

coastal subsidence are included, costs in large coastal cities across the world are

84	  

estimated to reach $1 trillion a year in the absence of adaptation measures [9].

85	  

In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), 7.5 million inhabitants and $299

86	  

billion USD in built capital are exposed to flooding from a 100-year event, without

87	  

considering hurricanes [10]. This exposure will increase to 8.8 to 9.9 million inhabitants

88	  

by mid-century, when taking into account extreme sea levels, increasing populations, and

89	  

the historical trend in storm activity [10]. Flooding presents a high social and economic

90	  

burden, particularly in low-income vulnerable populations – those who are least able to

91	  

cope with the impacts and recover from the damages of flood events.

92	  

To address flooding and other disasters, the global Sendai Framework for Disaster

93	  

Risk Reduction (2015-2030) identifies understanding disaster risk as a top priority [11].

94	  

This understanding should encompass the multiple dimensions of vulnerability, capacity,

95	  

exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics, and the environment. A better

96	  

understanding of local community perceptions of flood hazards can inform risk

97	  

management planning that aims to reduce exposure to flood events while strengthening

98	  

the resilience and adaptive capacity of communities (i.e., Sendai Framework priority #3)

99	  

[11,12].This understanding can inform the development of tailored climate services for

100	  

disaster managers, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs) [11,11,13,14].

5

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
101	  

Early warning systems are integrated systems of surveillance, forecasting, and

102	  

prediction of threats; assessment of disaster risks; communication of activities, systems

103	  

and processes; and preparation that allow people, communities, governments, companies

104	  

and other interested parties to take appropriate measures to reduce disaster risks in

105	  

advance of hazardous events [15]. In the United Nations Climate Change COP15, sixteen

106	  

of the 21 Latin American countries listed the improvement and establishment of early

107	  

warning systems for climatic events, including floods, as a priority. When implemented

108	  

effectively as part of a comprehensive risk management plan, a well-designed EWSF

109	  

increases community and ecosystem resilience, reduces vulnerability and reduces

110	  

damages to economies, health, property, infrastructure, and other assets of people,

111	  

communities, nations, and the private sector [16,17].

112	  

Coastal Ecuador is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to an extensive, densely

113	  

populated coastline along the Pacific Ocean [10]. One in thirteen people (7%) in the

114	  

country live below 5 meters of elevation. Coastal Ecuador experiences severe floods

115	  

during El Niño events due to strong teleconnections that increase local rainfall, as

116	  

observed in 1997-1998, and 2016 [18,19]. A recent study identified coastal Ecuador as

117	  

the highest coastal risk location in LAC due to a combination of coastal hazards,

118	  

geographic exposure, and socioeconomic vulnerability [20]. When flood costs are

119	  

measured as percentage of GDP, the coastal city of Guayaquil (population 2,644,891,

120	  

[21]) ranks as the 3rd most vulnerable city to flooding worldwide [9]. In these coastal

121	  

cities, unstructured rapid urbanization has pushed the poor into low-lying areas along

122	  

estuarine waterways prone to flooding [22,23]. Coastal hazards, exposure (of people

123	  

assets, and ecosystems), and poverty converge for a perfect storm during natural disaster

6

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
124	  

emergencies that are anticipated to increase in frequency and severity due to climate

125	  

change [24–26].

126	  

In Ecuador, the Secretary of Risk Management (renamed the National Service for

127	  

Risk Management and Emergencies in 2018) has the primary responsibility to establish

128	  

early warning systems with a multi-hazard approach, through collaboration with national

129	  

technical-scientific institutions, civil defense, and local governments [15]. EWSFs have

130	  

been implemented in most of the river basins throughout the country using basic data;

131	  

however, detailed hydrometeorological data are available in four hydrographic basins

132	  

only. While these data sources are a key part of the national EWS, it is widely understood

133	  

that a lack of economic resources have impacted the operational capacity of EWSFs (A.

134	  

Vaca, pers. comm.). Municipalities also play a key role in risk management and can

135	  

solicit support to develop an EWSF, as they are required to adopt technologies and

136	  

procedures for the prevention and management of risks to individuals, communities, and

137	  

the environment [27]. Local adaptation measures, such as EWSFs, are urgently needed to

138	  

reduce the risk and impact of flood events. However, these measures should be informed

139	  

by a nuanced understanding of local social-ecological conditions, including community

140	  

perceptions and past experiences with flooding.

141	  

The aim of this study was to assess community perceptions and self-reported

142	  

actions in response to flooding in periurban neighborhoods in coastal Ecuador. Using

143	  

focus groups, participatory mapping, and community timelines, we investigated the

144	  

following topics from the perspective of local community members: (1) local flood

145	  

hazards including the causes of exposure to flooding; the frequency, duration, and

146	  

location of flood exposure; (2) factors influencing residents’ sensitivity to flooding; (3)

7

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
147	  

the local capacity to prepare, respond and recover to floods, generating insights on the

148	  

adaptive capacity of each community; (4) current local warning systems for flooding.

149	  
150	  

Methods

151	  

Ethics statement. This study was conducted in collaboration with the local

152	  

municipal government of Machala and the Secretary of Risk Management of Ecuador.

153	  

The investigation protocol was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional Review

154	  

Board of SUNY Upstate Medical University. All participants were over the age of 18 and

155	  

no personal identifying information was collected.

156	  

Study Area. The midsized port city of Machala (population 279,887) is located on

157	  

the southern coast of Ecuador [21]. The economy of the city is based on agriculture

158	  

(bananas, cacao, coffee), aquaculture (shrimp), mining, and commerce associated with a

159	  

major port and proximity to the Peruvian border. The city was settled on lowland

160	  

mangrove forests and has an estuarine inlet along the Gulf of Guayaquil [28]. Machala

161	  

grew through a rapid, unstructured process of mangrove deforestation for shrimp farms

162	  

and urban settlements, resulting in (1) modification of the local hydrology of the

163	  

mangroves and (2) flood-prone slums bordering the mangrove fragments at the urban

164	  

periphery. In a recent analysis of urban coastal risks in Latin American and the

165	  

Caribbean, El Oro was identified as the number one hotspot of risk due to the large at-

166	  

risk population, susceptible ecosystems, high hazards due to El Niño events, and rates of

167	  

social vulnerability (i.e., high infant mortality rates, high malnutrition, low income and

168	  

high inequality) [20].

169	  

The tropical climate is marked by a hot rainy season from January to April

8

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
170	  

(average max temp = 31.7° in April), when 79% of rainfall occurs (average annual

171	  

rainfall = 675 mm). Heavy rainfall is associated with El Niño events [29–31], such as the

172	  

exceptionally strong 1997-1998 event, when over 1800 mm of rainfall were recorded. El

173	  

Niño events occur cyclically (every 2 to 7 years) when tropical central and eastern Pacific

174	  

Ocean surface temperatures increase, resulting in local climate anomalies [32].

175	  

Three neighborhoods in the urban periphery were selected as study sites. These

176	  

were identified as high flood risk zones through discussions with the municipal

177	  

government and local Secretary of Risk officials (Figure 1). The sites were located 1.5-3

178	  

km apart. Site 1 was Sauces 2, a neighborhood adjacent to an abandoned shrimp farm

179	  

(pop. 1266). Site 2 was Urseza 2 Sector 3, a neighborhood adjacent to a local river

180	  

system (pop. 498). Site 3 included Rayito de Luz and Riveras del Macho, two

181	  

neighborhoods adjacent to a large drainage canal (combined pop. 2258). Neighborhood

182	  

characteristics from the most recent national census are presented in Table 1. Generally,

183	  

these communities lacked adequate access to urban infrastructure, such as paved streets,

184	  

garbage collection, and municipal water/sewer connection.

Research framework. In this study, we utilized a research framework that is

191	  

situated in the context of disaster risk reduction by encompassing the measures needed to

192	  

achieve risk reduction and community resilience, as previously described [25] (Figure 2).

193	  

In this framework, we adapted previously published operational measurement models for

194	  

research on flood risk management [26–29] to gain insights into the unique flood risk

195	  

challenges experienced by high-risk communities in Ecuador. The primary metrics that

196	  

we explored were flood hazards and vulnerabilities (Figure 2). We identified two tiers of

197	  

flood hazards, with primary hazards defined as direct impacts from flooding events, such

11

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
198	  

as high velocity flows destroying houses or eroding roads or bridges. We defined

199	  

secondary hazards as those stemming from primary hazards, such as contaminated

200	  

drinking water, power outages, or interruptions to communication or transportation

201	  

systems. Flood vulnerability metrics include exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity.

202	  

Exposure to flooding describes the presence of communities in places that could be

203	  

adversely affected by flood hazards. Sensitivity, also called “susceptibility,” refers to the

204	  

physical predisposition of exposed individuals or communities to be negatively affected

205	  

by a flood event due to lack of resistance or predisposition to suffer harm as a

206	  

consequence of a flood event [34–36]. Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of the

207	  

system to respond or adjust to a flooding event, to moderate potential damage, to take

208	  

advantage of opportunities, and to cope with the transformations that occur as a result of

209	  

the flooding [34]. As a sub-category of adaptive capacity, this framework examines

210	  

livelihood capitals [37,38] – the vital resource bases of communities and different

211	  

categories of households (e.g., human, natural, financial, physical and social capitals).

226	  

Focus Group Methodology. Semi-structured focus group discussions were held in

227	  

each community. Neighborhood residents were recruited to participate in focus group

228	  

discussion in consultation with the presidents of each neighborhood council, and when

229	  

applicable (in two communities), the presidents of the councils of women. Focus groups

230	  

were segmented by gender (groups of men and women) based on local recommendations

231	  

and our prior experience that this approach would elicit more open dialogue. Each focus

232	  

group met twice, with both meetings led by a moderator and documented by a group note

233	  

taker, who summarized the discussion on poster paper in real-time. The first focus group

234	  

included questions regarding people’s previous experiences with flooding, specifically

235	  

the causes and impacts of flooding, frequency of flooding, areas flooded, and the relative

236	  

intensity of flood exposure. With facilitated guidance from the moderator, participants

237	  

generated a timeline of flood events in each community; they self defined these events as

238	  

floods that exceeded their perception of normal (shallower) annual flooding. They noted

239	  

the depth of normal flooding and specific flood events, and they listed the causes and

240	  

impacts of flooding. A mapping exercise was conducted to identify high-risk areas and

241	  

flood extent in each area during normal years and during moderate and extreme flood

242	  

events. Focus group participants divided into groups of 3-5 people and were provided

243	  

printed aerial imagery maps of their neighborhood. To orient themselves, participants

244	  

first marked the location of important neighborhood landmarks (e.g. their homes, schools,

245	  

soccer fields). Participants then outlined the areas impacted by the flooding events

246	  

identified in the timeline, and they identified other areas of special concern with respect

247	  

to flooding (e.g., areas with inadequate infrastructure). Map elements were verified by

248	  

researchers and community leaders who walked through the community and

14

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
249	  

georeferenced key landmarks and locations using handheld GPS units.

250	  

Within three weeks the same groups reconvened for a second focus group to

251	  

discuss flood-related actions taken in their community, specifically preparation actions

252	  

taken before flood events, response actions during flooding, and recovery actions post-

253	  

flooding. People were also asked to identify key institutional partners associated with the

254	  

actions, community assets, and resource limitations.

255	  

All focus group discussions were held in the late afternoon or evening in a

256	  

community meeting area and lasted between 60 and 90 minutes. Representatives from the

257	  

Secretary of Risk Management were present at every meeting to answer questions once

258	  

the discussion was over. ET facilitated the focus group discussions and was accompanied

259	  

by local research assistants who were trained as observers and note takers. All

260	  

discussions were tape-recorded and transcribed with permission from participants. Local

261	  

research assistants transcribed the recordings of focus groups.

262	  

We analyzed transcripts using a codebook and qualitative analysis software,

263	  

Dedoose Version 6.1.11. Transcripts of focus groups and field notes were coded using the

264	  

research framework described in Figure 2; codes are presented in S1 Table. Participant-

265	  

generated histories of flood events (years and flood depth) were converted into bar charts

266	  

for each site. Participant-generated maps of flood extent, areas of special concern, and

267	  

community landmarks were digitized using Q-GIS and ArcGIS. Our findings were

268	  

presented to communities and to the municipal government in January 2015 for feedback

269	  

and validation.

Results

273	  

Eleven semi-structured focus group discussions, with a total of 65 people, were

274	  

held from September 2014 to November 2014 (three focus groups in Site 1, four focus

275	  

groups in Site 2, four focus groups in Site 3). A range of 6 to 25 people participated in

276	  

each focus group, which were segmented by gender and neighborhood, and represented a

277	  

range of age groups (age range: late teens to late 70s).

278	  

Exposure and flood hazards. Community members reported normal annual

279	  

flooding following heavy seasonal rains, with floods ranging in depth ranged from 0.1

280	  

(Site 3) to 1 meter (Site 2) (Figure 3). The number of greater than normal flood events

281	  

that occurred over the last 30 years ranged from two (site 1, flooding every 15 years) to

282	  

eight events (site 3, flooding every 3-4 years). Flood events ranged in depth from 0.5 to 3

283	  

meters, and their duration lasted anywhere from hours to months. The largest flood

284	  

events were observed in 1982 and 1997/98, which coincided with some of the strongest

285	  

El Niño events on record. Other flood events in 1992 and 1994 may have been associated

286	  

with moderate El Niño events. Sites 2 and 3 reported a similar total number of flood

287	  

events (7 and 8, respectively); however, the average depth of floods in site 2 (2.3 meters,

288

People identified and mapped the sectors of their neighborhood that flooded

294	  

annually and during exceptional flood events (Figure 4). They identified ten areas of

295	  

special concern for flooding. For example, participants at Site 3 identified a berm that

296	  

was built recently to isolate floodwaters from the adjacent low-lying residential area. The

297	  

berm was built without a concrete cap and individuals were illegally removing fill

298	  

material from the berm for their personal use, thereby weakening the berm’s protective

299	  

capacity. Participants were concerned the berm would collapse during the next flood

300	  

event, further compounding the flood hazards of nearby homes.

301	  

“The government built this berm, but the people are not aware [of the purpose]:

302	  

they remove the berm material to fill their own [properties]. They don’t know.

303	  

The problem is that it endangers us all. Luckily it hasn’t rained hard recently.”

Figure 4. Flooding Extents within Study Areas. Maps generated by focus group

308	  

members show the geographic extent of historic floods occurring within their

309	  

communities. The ten areas of special concern included the following: (1) Key places

310	  

with strong currents during floods— these areas encompassed police and fire stations,

311	  

along with community health clinic; (2) inadequately-sized drainage pipes; (3) El Macho

312	  

Canal—a tidal-influenced canal that acts as primary drainage canal for sewer and

313	  

stormwater systems, and a source of floodwater; (4) former shrimp farm—many parcels

314	  

are unfilled and are full of water year-rounds; streets in this area have large persistent

315	  

mud puddles that limit transit and pedestrians; (5) El Tigre Canal—a stagnant ditch that

316	  

regularly overflows, flooding roads and private homes; (6) a primary road that remains

317	  

dry during seasonal floods—this intersection also is used as a meeting area for

318	  

community events; (7) inadequately-sized culverts; (8) a low-lying area that was formerly

319	  

a brick quarry (known as “the hole”)—this site has an elementary school and private

320	  

residences and endures annual flooding; (9) a berm constructed of uncapped material

321	  

fill—material is being removed illegally and used as fill for private properties; (10)

322	  

abandoned shrimp farm—stagnant pools collect water and periodically flood.

19

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
323	  

Community members reported that proximity to blocked drainage areas was the

324	  

most important geographic determinant of flood exposure; blockages were notably

325	  

caused by trash accumulation. People indicated that most areas within the communities

326	  

did not have regular municipal garbage collection and infrastructure (e.g. trash

327	  

platforms), which when combined with the presence of stray dogs and illegal dumping,

328	  

resulted in a severe and perpetual litter problem.

329	  

High tides were the second key factor impacting the exposure of certain

330	  

communities, particularly those near estuarine canals at the edge of the city (e.g., Site 1,

331	  

Figure 4). High tides impeded rainwater runoff during heavy rainfall events, resulting in

332	  

flooding. Machala’s largest estuarine canal, “El Macho”, is one of the two main canals

333	  

that transport the city’s runoff and untreated sewage into the ocean. Participants from Site

334	  

1 reported that as recently as 30 years ago, El Macho canal was a naturally flowing

335	  

mangrove inlet, with clear water used for swimming, bathing and fishing. In recent

336	  

decades, increasing urban settlements have augmented sedimentation and flow rates in

337	  

the canal, coupled with the proliferation of formal and informal sewer drains flowing into

338	  

the canal.

339	  

Low elevation was the third factor that increased people’s exposure to flood

340	  

waters. Unfilled parcels of land collected standing water that could linger for months, or

341	  

in some cases, year round. Participants from Site 2 (Figure 4) identified year-round

342	  

flooding problems, particularly in properties that had not purchased material fill and

343	  

lacked pumps and sewer systems to remove the pools of water in the unfilled parcels.

344	  

“There is no [storm] sewer system…here it rains and it stagnates. It doesn’t have

345	  

anywhere to go.” (Woman from Site 2)

20

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
346	  

The ability to raise the elevation of a property was dependent on the economic resources

347	  

of the family, as described in the following,

348	  

“Sometimes the [economic] situation of some families is so low, and there is no

349	  

fill [because] there is no money” (Woman from Site 2)

350	  

Participants highlighted that management of growth and development in flood plains

351	  

would be a fundamental step to prevent flood exposure.

352	  

People reported that the primary hazards associated with flooding were damages

353	  

to individual property (e.g., homes, cars, animals) and damages to people’s health (e.g.,

354	  

drowning, injury). Secondary hazards included the disruption of transportation due to

355	  

road erosion and destabilization of infrastructure and buildings. A participant described

356	  

the compounding impact that floods had on existing infrastructure, which was perceived

357	  

as inadequate for flood drainage:

358	  

“On the street where I live, there’s a canal… That canal is now pure garbage,

359	  

which clogs [the culvert] and stagnates it. This year we are afraid that it’s going

360	  

to rupture… the pipe is very small.” (Woman from Site 1)

361	  

Other health impacts were also identified as a key secondary hazards of flooding,

362	  

including water- and vector-borne diseases, and venomous snakebites. Vector-borne

363	  

diseases (notably dengue fever transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito) were noted as

364	  

a risk factor for residents who lived in proximity to pools of standing water. Participants

365	  

reported the amplification of skin infections during annual flooding, when people came

366	  

into contact with stagnant water mixed with flood and wastewater. With a lack of

367	  

adequate sewerage infrastructure and low-elevation streets, exposure to flood water and

368	  

mud, and the resulting health outcomes, was identified as a chronic problem.

21

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
369	  

Sensitivity to flooding. Participants reported that certain demographic groups were

370	  

particularly afflicted by flood-related health problems, as well as economic and material

371	  

losses. Across all focus groups, children, the elderly, and the physically handicapped

372	  

were identified as the most sensitive populations, due to lower immunity to infections;

373	  

decreased mobility; and reliance on others for medication, food, and water. Children were

374	  

also vulnerable due to higher exposure to contaminated floodwaters while playing

375	  

outdoors. Focus groups identified low-income households as highly sensitive, since they

376	  

were less likely to have a second floor of the home where they could seek refuge or store

377	  

valuables during floods. They were also less likely to have a rooftop cistern with ample

378	  

freshwater, and were less able to purchase fill to raise the level of their parcel. Residents

379	  

who relied on public transportation systems were affected because they had to wade

380	  

through floodwaters and mud during their daily commutes. Car owners also faced

381	  

financial burdens due to damages to their automobiles during floods. Other sensitive

382	  

groups included people with livestock (poultry primarily) and pets (cats, dogs), as well as

383	  

people without nearby relatives to help with recovery costs and evacuations.

384	  

Adaptive capacity across flood stages. Adaptive capacity refers to the capacity of

385	  

the community to respond or adjust to a flooding event, moderate potential damage, take

386	  

advantage of opportunities, and cope with the consequences of a transformation that

387	  

occurs as a result of the flooding [39]. Community members discussed identified

388	  

community resources, actions taken during the three phases of flood events (preparation

389	  

and prevention, response, and recovery), and factors that affected their ability to respond.

390	  

Key neighborhood resources with respect to flooding included green areas,

391	  

schools, nurseries, fire stations, health clinics, police stations, a retention wall (berm), and

22

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
392	  

an emergency meeting place (S2 Figure). The number of resources ranged from two (site

393	  

1) to five (site 3). Schools and green areas were the most important resources, as these

394	  

were reported by two of the three sites. In the past, flood evacuations had interrupted the

395	  

school year due to the use of schools as shelters. Recently, however, the national policy

396	  

of using schools as evacuation shelters was abolished, and evacuees are now directed

397	  

towards a city sports center.

398	  

With respect to the flood preparation and prevention stage, people perceived that

399	  

the most important household-level action was purchasing fill material to raise the level

400	  

of low-lying parcels, as identified by all focus groups. They also perceived the

401	  

importance of stocking up on canned food, bottled water and flashlights, and creating

402	  

flood emergency kits. They noted that household members should keep their patios tidy

403	  

as a way to maintain clear drainage systems during floods and to prevent the spread of

404	  

mosquito-borne diseases At the community level, participants, particularly in Sites 1 and

405	  

2, recommended community cleanups (“mingas”) to remove accumulated debris from

406	  

drainage canals. Participants from Site 3 had recently formed a neighborhood brigade

407	  

(“brigada barrial”) that had been trained in flood response simulations by the National

408	  

Secretary of Risk Management. Most individuals, however, were unaware of this

409	  

initiative, suggesting the need for community outreach and education by governmental

410	  

agencies. Participants identified limited household financial resources and lack of

411	  

community leadership as underlying barriers to flood prevention. They also perceived

412	  

that the community lacked the political voice and coordination needed to obtain support

413	  

for large-scale infrastructure improvements to reduce flood exposure, as expressed in the

414	  

following:

23

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
415	  

There is no communication between authorities… People do not put pressure on

416	  

them to do something good for the neighborhood. What people always want to do

417	  

is to overthrow the government, not to put the pressure on them to do something

418	  

good for the neighborhood.” (Man from Site 3)

419	  

A community leader commented on community fatigue and the difficulty in organizing

420	  

people for preparation efforts (or other initiatives for that matter) after a prolonged local

421	  

campaign to legalize the informal community ended successfully and residents now had a

422	  

sense of complacency in their political involvement.

423	  

“The moment that the mayor legalized the properties… nobody came to meetings.

424	  

That is what happens… when it comes to a workshop, [now] no one has time.

425	  

They will tell you, ‘I am busy.’… Now it takes a lot of effort to organize us.”

426	  

(Woman from Site 2)

427	  

Participants discussed the effectiveness of the formal and informal flood warnings

428	  

preceding the flood response stage. They indicated that formal communication outlets

429	  

(e.g. television and radio) did provide general flood warnings based on forecasted rainfall

430	  

as part of an existing official EWSF operated by the national government. However, they

431	  

perceived that the forecasts were either too general or not timely enough. A participant

432	  

described an ad-hoc warning system, based on upstream river observations,

433	  

"Sometimes, by chance, one travels from Guabo [a nearby town upstream from

434	  

Machala] to see that the Jubones River is full. Then they will let us know that

435	  

there is risk [of flooding] ... It's the only way [to know in advance], because the

436	  

authorities do not warn us, and there are no alarms ... nothing. The last time that

437	  

the Jubones peaked and overflowed, [down] here was a scorching sun… It

24

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
438	  

happens because the Jubones brings water from the mountains (Azuay) and when

439	  

the Jubones fills, and there is high tide here, we flood." (Woman from Site 3)

440	  

Other instances of informal flood warnings occurred through community communication

441	  

channels on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp. Focus group

442	  

participants suggested that there should be more use of these existing communication

443	  

channels during the flood response. However, they also indicated that excessive reliance

444	  

on informal communication chains in times of crisis might lead to problems in reaching

445	  

all members of the community equally. For that reason, all focus groups identified the use

446	  

of sirens or loudspeakers as the most effective way to alert people for flood evacuations.

447	  

With respect to the flood response stage, people perceived community and

448	  

governmental actions to be relatively effective. Community members were mobilized

449	  

during times of crisis to help their neighbors in need. At Site 2, neighbors helped each

450	  

other dig ad-hoc drainage ditches when a clogged canal created a small flood.

451	  

Governmental actions included emitting alerts and coordinating evacuations and rescues.

452	  

However, enforcing mandated evacuations was difficult, according to focus groups, due

453	  

to the real concern of looting and the lack of police surveillance. When asked how one

454	  

decided to stay or go during a flood evacuation, one participant responded,

455	  

“You have to stay because if not, you will be left without anything… the thieves do

456	  

not care. They jump into the water and that’s it.” (Woman from Site 3)

457	  

During the flood recovery stage, community members struggled to take actions to

458	  

repair the damages caused by flooding. People said that they were responsible for bearing

459	  

the cost of rebuilding their home, and they were unaware of flood insurance programs for

460	  

private homeowners. Participants indicated that approximately one month of wages were

25

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
461	  

lost during reconstruction efforts following extreme flood events—a significant loss for a

462	  

low-income family. Although they identified some governmental and non-governmental

463	  

organization (NGO) programs that assist in rebuilding homes (e.g. Hogares del Cristo),

464	  

these programs were highly competitive, middle class families were not eligible, and the

465	  

bamboo construction was perceived as not durable. Despite these challenges, they did

466	  

describe moments of unity to help each other rebuild after the flood, for example when

467	  

people at Site 1 came together to repair a neighbor’s home that had collapsed into the

468	  

Macho Canal. Community members expressed distrust of local authorities, which they

469	  

perceived to be more interested in political maneuvering than improving the welfare of

470	  

the people.

471	  

“The authorities only come when there are votes and when it's election time…

472	  

They offer [funding] when there are elections… Or when there is a collapsed

473	  

house or a drowning, but [even then] only that family is helped.” (Man from Site

474	  

1)

475	  
476	  

Discussion

477	  

Coastal flooding incurs a high social and economic burden worldwide, and the

478	  

impacts are projected to increase in urban areas [1,2]. Information on local community

479	  

perceptions of flood exposure, vulnerabilities, and adaptive capacity can inform the

480	  

implementation of tailored flood risk reduction strategies, such as those of the United

481	  

Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction to prepare, respond, and “build

482	  

back better” in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction [11]. This study was

483	  

conducted in high flood risk areas in Machala, Ecuador, one of the most vulnerable cities

26

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
484	  

in the Americas for coastal flooding. The findings and the participatory approach applied

485	  

here can inform practitioners and community members seeking to implement

486	  

interventions to reduce flood exposure. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies

487	  

have been conducted in this region to understand community perceptions of flooding.

488	  

This study revealed persistent social-ecological vulnerabilities that increased

489	  

flood risk and exposure in the urban periphery, such as inadequate access to garbage

490	  

collection, homes settled in precarious low-lying geographies, economic barriers, lack of

491	  

political access, and lack of social mobilization. These findings build upon prior studies

492	  

highlighting specific socioeconomic drivers of flood vulnerabilities in urban Latin

493	  

American cities [10,20]. The adaptive capacity of communities in Machala is severely

494	  

limited by lack of clean water, sanitation, property insurance, and secure employment. In

495	  

addition, communities expressed a lack of social capital (e.g. political voice), despite the

496	  

existence of formalized community councils. Previous studies have also shown that social

497	  

capital, including social networks, familiar ties, and traditions are much less supportive

498	  

and less stable in urban areas than they are in rural areas, where individuals share the

499	  

same culture and community attachment [40,41].

500	  

Community members described a history of annual flooding and extreme flood

501	  

events associated with strong El Niño events coupled with high tides. To date, the flood

502	  

warnings in Ecuador incorporate only rainfall data. Integrated monitoring networks are

503	  

needed, as tidal levels play a key role in coastal flood events. Recent studies suggest the

504	  

potential to forecast El Niño events up to two years in advance [42], and these models are

505	  

being used with an ensemble of climate forecasts to predict climate conditions and

506	  

mosquito-borne disease epidemics in this region [19]. During the exceptionally strong

27

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
507	  

2016 El Niño event, investigators were able to accurately predict the large flood event

508	  

that occurred in Machala in February and the increase in dengue fever transmission one

509	  

month later [19]. This was the largest flood on record since the 1997-1998 El Niño; over

510	  

170 mm of rain fell in 10 hours and coincided with high tides [43]. This flood event

511	  

occurred after this study was completed, but it certainly appears that many of the same

512	  

risk factors were at play. The incorporation of El Niño events and tidal data in flood

513	  

hazard modeling for coastal areas is a critical component of management efforts along

514	  

the Pacific coast of Latin America [10].

515	  

This study builds on existing vulnerability frameworks [26–29] and risk analyses

516	  

[20] by providing qualitative insights on local flood risk to otherwise traditionally

517	  

quantitative analyses, in line with the priorities of Sendai Framework [11]. Our findings

518	  

complement these other assessments by providing a fine-scale analysis that focuses of

519	  

flood perceptions at the community level.

520	  

This study provides a localized perspective on the ecological drivers of flood

521	  

vulnerabilities, such as the loss of coastal mangroves. Between 1969 and 2011,

522	  

mangroves in Ecuador declined 62%, largely due to the construction of shrimp farms

523	  

[44,45]. Sites from this study were either former mangrove areas or in close proximity to

524	  

former mangrove areas. Mangroves regulate the impacts of climatic events, an essential

525	  

ecosystem service, through buffering of storm surges, trapping sediment and debris, and

526	  

reducing the impact of waves and high winds [46]. The loss of mangroves makes coastal

527	  

cities, like Machala, more vulnerable to the hazards of storms and associated flooding.

528	  

Mangrove restoration and conservation are a “nature based solution” [47] to reduce the

529	  

risk of coastal flooding [48].

28

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
530	  

This study provides local insights into the escalating social injustices associated

531	  

with development in low-lying coastal areas. With high development costs to elevate

532	  

homes out of the floodplain, matched with land use policies that drive low-income

533	  

communities into these low-lying areas, we hypothesize that the communities in this

534	  

study bear a proportionately greater social and economic burden of flooding than

535	  

wealthier communities in Machala. Additionally, areas close to sea level are more likely

536	  

to be impacted by sea level rise due to climate change, further increasing localized

537	  

financial burdens.

538	  

Community members reported limited adaptive capacity, which was most notable

539	  

in the preparation/prevention and the recovery/rebuild phases of the flood response. Prior

540	  

studies have also noted that adaptive capacity to the impacts of climate change is low

541	  

throughout Latin America [49], particularly in urban areas [50]. This has been attributed

542	  

to poor housing conditions, a lack of infrastructure, lack of decision-maker access to local

543	  

data, and national policy that focuses primarily on mitigation efforts as opposed to

544	  

adaptation efforts [12,22,51]. Additional research is needed to identify effective climate

545	  

change adaptation strategies in Latin American cities [49].

546	  

The results of this study suggest that the participatory community-based

547	  

assessment methodology used here may be an effective tool for practitioners and

548	  

researchers. The community timelines developed by the focus groups provided localized

549	  

indicators of the relative impact that El Niño events had on their community in the past.

550	  

While memory driven data is predisposed for inaccuracies (e.g., see year-to-year

551	  

discrepancies between focus group recollections of the 1982 and 1997/1998 El Niño

552	  

events) and over-simplicity (e.g. factors of tidal blockages include astronomical tides,

29

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
553	  

storm surges, wave run-up and sea level rise), we found that community-driven timelines

554	  

did provide a useful conversation tool as well as a gauge for the relative impacts of

555	  

episodic flooding. In cities such as Machala, where accurate local hydrological records do

556	  

not exist for periurban areas, community timelines can provide a reasonable source of

557	  

data records that can be triangulated with meteorological and climate records across

558	  

larger spatial scales.

559	  

Since this qualitative case study focused on high-risk periurban areas, these

560	  

findings cannot be generalized to other moderate to low risk communities, or to

561	  

communities that face a lower overall risk of flooding. Also, participants who opted to

562	  

participate in this study may have been more motivated to do so based on their personal

563	  

experience with flooding. Historical intensity and frequency of flooding are subject to the

564	  

collective community memories. This case study was not used to prioritize a particular

565	  

group by their vulnerability, but rather to present a nuanced characterization of flooding

566	  

in high-risk communities. In this way, the methodology provides key insights necessary

567	  

to inform potential flood risk reduction actions.

568	  

Opportunities and policy implications. In 2006, the document “Developing Early

569	  

Warning Systems: A Checklist” was developed to implement the early warning

570	  

components of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction Hyogo Framework for

571	  

Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters

572	  

[52].

573	  

warning systems: 1) risk knowledge built upon systematic collection of data to address

574	  

patterns and trends for a variety of hazards and vulnerability; 2) monitoring and warning

575	  

services built upon accurate and timely scientific information; 3) clear and

This document presents four key elements essential to people-centered early

30

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
576	  

understandable dissemination and communication of risk information and early warnings

577	  

to all members of the public; and 4) responses based on updated and tested plans that

578	  

utilize local capacities and knowledge and are familiar to the public. The following

579	  

findings and recommendations are elicited from this case study, and they link to the UN-

580	  

ISDR Early Warning System checklist items discussed above.

581	  

(1) Improve monitoring and accuracy of warnings. We found that many individuals

582	  

lacked confidence in the ability of existing official EWSFs to accurately predict flooding

583	  

risk and chose to rely on informal information channels for localized flood information.

584	  

This suggests that there is room to improve the effectiveness of existing systems.

585	  

Hydrological monitoring and flood forecasts can be improved by increasing the number

586	  

of upstream water level stations, by incorporating community monitoring and validation

587	  

[53], and by incorporating tidal and El Niño information. Identifying locations and

588	  

thresholds of water depths upstream that predict downstream flooding could optimize

589	  

monitoring networks.

described in detail in a resource manual developed by the International Centre for

591	  

Integrated Mountain Development (Pradhan, et al. 2016).

592	  

(2) Develop clear flood warnings across a variety of communication channels. Our

593	  

findings suggest that the use of both formal and informal communication networks may

594	  

improve the delivery of EWSFs information. Flood forecasts issued via a system of sirens

595	  

or loudspeakers, AM radio (used by taxi drivers) or other individualized alert systems

596	  

(possibly text alerts) could complement the existing television or radios communication

597	  

channels. In doing so, community members could potentially have more time to move

598	  

household belongings, gather livestock and/or evacuate. While sirens provide a warning

This community-based approach to EWSFs has been further

31

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
599	  

to all individuals within hearing range, their effectiveness depends on whether

600	  

community members know how to respond. More individualized warnings, such as text

601	  

messaging, could be accompanied with detailed instructions on how to best respond

602	  

based on different locations or varying mobility ranges.

603	  

(3) Integrate EWSFs with existing community flood response systems. We found that

604	  

community-level actions were a key element of the effectiveness of the flood response.

605	  

An EWSF can further take advantage of these local resources by being thoroughly

606	  

integrated into a variety of community-based initiatives and organizations. Community

607	  

members said that they were capable of participating in collective actions like work

608	  

brigades, childcare, or training each other in preparation simulations. Education

609	  

campaigns should be adequately staffed and resourced to properly inform communities

610	  

on how EWSFs work, along continuing efforts that implement simulations of the steps

611	  

needed to properly respond during floods. A good example was the recent tsunami EWS

612	  

outreach campaign in Ecuador, where community members received training and

613	  

identified potential escape routes and meeting locations for their families in the case of a

614	  

tsunami.

615	  

(4) Link climate change adaptation to disaster risk reduction and resilience modeling:

616	  

Consideration of long-term and cumulative impacts in flood modeling may be combined

617	  

to both generate better EWSFs and lead to more resilient infrastructure. Factors

618	  

contributing to flooding, like the improperly sized drainage and impermeable surfaces in

619	  

floodplains, should be incorporated into flood models. These flood models should be

620	  

applied when upgrading or repairing infrastructure to accommodate changes in flood

621	  

depth and frequency due to climate change.

32

Urban coastal flood vulnerability in Ecuador
622	  

(5) Include principles of flood resiliency and risk prevention in comprehensive planning

623	  

and land use regulations: We found that a lack of planning and regulatory land use tools,

624	  

as well as the lack of enforcement and implementation of existing plans and regulations

625	  

was one common factor underlying several issues discussed in focus groups, such as

626	  

uneven fill between properties and roads, dense development in high-risk flood zones and

627	  

low-quality building materials for both housing and sewer and stormwater infrastructure.

628	  

While risk management and climate change adaptation are national policies of Ecuador,

629	  

challenges remain in operationalizing climate adaptation and risk management policies

630	  

for local communities. Land-use zoning code and related land use policies should be

631	  

enacted and enforced to dissuade residential development in hazardous areas like canal

632	  

buffers and to use high-quality and appropriately-engineered flood management

633	  

structures. Educational and collaborative planning opportunities exist at both local and

634	  

municipal levels.

635	  
636	  

Conclusions

637	  

This study emerged in response to research priorities identified by National

638	  

Secretary of Risk of Ecuador, an active partner in this investigation. One outcome of this

639	  

study has been the empowerment of community members engaged in this research

640	  

process. Community leaders have used the results of this study to advocate for flood risk

641	  

reduction actions with local policymakers. Flood vulnerability assessment framework and

642	  

participatory research process utilized here can potentially inform studies in other flood-

643	  

prone regions to guide the development of EWSFs and other climate change adaptation

644	  

policies and actions.
