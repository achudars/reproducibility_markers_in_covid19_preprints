Abstract
This study aims to examine the use of English with political correctness of master’s degree
students in a university in Bangkok, Thailand and to identify their attitudes and opinions towards
the use of English with political correctness. The subjects of this study were 100 students from
different backgrounds who had been exposed to the English language for a significant period of
time. They were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of a test on the use of politically
correct English vocabularies and terms, and a survey of their opinions and attitudes towards the
use of English with political correctness. Five of the respondents were interviewed about their
attitudes. The findings reveal that students are able to identify certain politically correct words and
terms regardless of the categories. Respondents also have positive attitudes and they consider this
type of language as a formal and respectful language. They also suggest that this type of language
is important and it should be implemented in workplaces and certain fields. However, there are
few limitations of English with political correctness as it is considered unclear and sometimes it
is overused. Moreover, there is no institution or academic initiative to standardize the use of
English with political correctness. The findings could be useful to develop the use of English with
political correctness in society, to objectify politically correct language, and to promote the
importance of politically correct language, which is viewed as formal and respectful language that
can reduce conflicts in international communications.

An Analysis of the Use of English with Political Correctness

Phumsiri & Tangkiengsirisin

Introduction
In some countries where English is the official language, namely, Canada, Australia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States, there is an increasing tendency toward political
correctness in terms if language (Marques, 2009) and this tendency is becoming more crucial as
the world, where English is considered as a global language, is more globalized and linked than it
has ever been. Moreover, politically correct language has become common, not only in the use of
the English language but also in pedagogy and in the workplace. As a result, the knowledge of
political correctness would improve people’s ability to function better in academic and
professional English (Tsehelska, 2006).
According to Cambridge Dictionary, the term political correctness, usually abbreviated as
PC, refers to an idea that someone who is politically correct believes that language and actions
that could be offensive to others, especially those relating to sex and race, should be avoided.
Ely, Meyerson, and Davidson (2006) define political correctness as a situation “where unspoken
canons of propriety govern behaviour in cross-cultural interactions—that is, interactions among
people of different races, genders, religions, and other potentially charged social identity
groups”.(p.1) Consequently, this term, political correctness, has recently been widely discussed
as it has a significant impact on people’s perceptions and also the dynamics of the language. As
a result, the use of English with political correctness tends to help people to avoid offensiveness
in multicultural communication. Moreover, the use of English with political correctness will also
raise people’s awareness and gradually change the attitudes towards rights and equality.
Consequently, this study was conducted to analyse the current situation and predict
tendencies regarding the use of politically correct language to increase the effectiveness of English
use and knowledge of political correctness among different groups of people in the globalized era.
Literature Review
Historical Overview of Political Correctness
The terms political correctness, politically correct or PC had not been commonly used
until the end of the 1970s. According to Wilson (1995), in 1973, the U.S Supreme Court firstly
mentioned the term politically correct.
However, it is difficult to trace the origin of the meaning of ‘political correctness’ as this
term has evolved alongside the trends of political ideologies. For instance, in the late 1940s, the
phrase "politically correct" was used in political debates between socialists and members of the
communist party in the United States. The term politically correct was used as a reference to
person with loyalty to the party. Likewise, the socialists also used this term to go against
communism, and were meant to distinguish those who believed in moral ideas of egalitarianism
from dogmatic communists who defended party positions regardless of their moral belief (Kohl,
1992).
This term also appears the writings of the former Communist Party leader, namely, Mao
Zhedong. Perry (1992) mentions that Mao tried to control the regime by evaluating the terms
‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ in terms of free speech, contention and mutual criticism.

An Analysis of the Use of English with Political Correctness

Phumsiri & Tangkiengsirisin

Political correctness is also used sarcastically. For example, Berman (2011) explains that
the term PC was evolved by the Leninist Left into an ironic phrase among ‘wised-up leftists’ to
‘denote someone whose line-toeing fervor was too much to bear’ (Berman, 2011: 5) Also, in the
feminist movement, Willis (1992) states that in the early eighties, feminists sarcastically used the
term ‘political correctness’ to make a reference on the efforts of the anti-pornography movement.
In 1987, political correctness entered public awareness again when professor Thernstorm
gave ‘racially insensitive’ statements in a lecture on ‘the peopling of America’. Those statements
caused a lot of complaints from some students, especially African. Finally, this issue became
popular an open letter about the warning of racial harassment, written by the dean of the college,
was published (Annette, 1994) Three years later, a column in The New York Times claimed that
the term 'political correctness’ was being mentioned increasingly in debates about the contents
taught in the universities (Bernstein, 1990).
In modern usage, politically correct language is commonly seen alongside the issue of
media bias in the United States and in the United Kingdom (Lea, 2010). Media bias and politically
incorrect language could result in unexpected tragedy. There was an incident when a newspaper
writer mentioned about the Prophet Mohammed and the beauty queens of the Miss World Beauty
Pageant that was to be held in Nigeria. More than 250 people were killed and churches were
destroyed in this incident. Few years later, an incident occurred again with more than 50 casualties
in Borneo Island because of a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in a newspaper.(Pinta &Yakubu,
2014).
Pinta and Yakubu (2014) also highlight the implications of political correctness in the
education field, asserting the use of English language with political correctness can be beneficial,
particularly in second language situations while social and cultural contexts are taken into
consideration. In the view of Zabotkina (1989), the teachings of English as a Second Language
(ESL) or English as Foreign Language (EFL) should implement political correctness.
Speech Codes and Identity Politics
According to Cameron (1995), a 'speech code' can be considered as a kind of linguistic
guideline, which makes it 'a disciplinary offense to use certain expressions deemed racist, sexist,
anti-Semitic and homophobic'.
This term can refer to norms or regulations that do not explicitly forbid particular
vocabularies or sentences. Speech codes are normally used for suppressing hate speech or forms
of obnoxious social discourse. As a result, the utilization of many speech codes could be
controversial in relation to the meaning and significance of some words and phrases, and about the
legitimacy of those who justify the meaning.
Sexist Language and Gender Inclusive Language
Sexist language includes “words, phrases, and expressions that unnecessarily differentiate
between women and men or exclude, trivialize, or diminish either gender” (as cited in Na
Pattalung, 2008, p. 4). Some terms are inherently sexist, such as "businessman" and "mankind"
The terms fail to equalize the female gender in categories that should be gender inclusive.

Moreover, these terms are often considered appropriate in writing (Klein, 1993). The term "genderinclusive" implies that all genders are explicitly "included". For example, "A teacher should help
his students" could be understood as excluding females from being teachers.
There are several aspects of the trend toward gender-inclusive English. A study examined
the use of a generic term ‘they’ to refer to all genders by avoiding using the gender-exclusive
generic he; for example, "A doctor should keep his patients informed", to gender-inclusive form;
"Doctors should keep their patients informed" or "A doctor should keep her or his patients
informed" Also, the change from the use of the gender-exclusive generic ‘man’. For example,
"Man has lived on the planet for over a million years", to "Humans have lived on the planet for
over a million years" (Ong, et al., 1996).
Previous Related Studies
Andrews (1996) studied the popular opinions towards the naming of words that were
involved in ‘political correctness’ and ‘cultural sensitivity’ based on semiotic and sociolinguistic
theory. The study is focused on words about gender, race, disabilities, and ethnicity; for example,
Asian vs. Oriental, Black vs. African American. The findings show that naming is determined by
concepts and word taboos, but interpreters imposed the meaning of a name. The study also shows
that socio-cultural movement affects political correctness and this phenomenon reflects the
interplay between linguistic signs and dynamic changes in social contexts.
Banning (2004) analyzes the discourse of political correctness in classrooms designed to
examine critical contemporary issues of popular culture and the public sphere. She “was concerned
with the impact of social justice and public debate, and more broadly, with the question of what
role rhetoric and writing courses could play in preparing students for civic engagement” (Banning,
2004, p.192) The outcome indicated that studying political correctness could foster critical
thinking abilities on social issues (Banning, 2004).
Lin (2010) extended both of the above mentioned studies and investigated the difference
in the use of politically correct language between native speakers of English and non-native
speakers. A total of 21 students, 14 native speakers of English and seven non-native speakers of
English (all females) who studied in a U.S mid-western university were asked to complete a
questionnaire consisting of 30 multiple choice questions and three open-ended questions. The first
part consisted of various PC words in different topics: age, gender, race/ethnicity, physical/mental
challenges, taboos, economic status, occupation, cars, prisoners, drunkenness, biological
companions and class of airline service and the second part were questions that aimed to get
opinions about the phenomenon of PC language. The results showed that native speakers of
English, especially whites, have different attitudes toward PC compared with non-native speakers.
It could be inferred that the white participants felt it was not necessary to use PC language.
However, most participants believed that PC was not temporary but it would continue to develop.
Research Methodology
Participants
The subjects in the study were 100 students studying in a master’s degree program at a
university in Bangkok, Thailand.

An Analysis of the Use of English with Political Correctness

Phumsiri & Tangkiengsirisin

The students were enrolled in a master’s degree in English program. They were students
interested in English with different ages, occupations, and genders. Thus, the use of English with
political correctness will be essential for these students to enhance their ability to communicate in
an international environment and develop their careers. Likewise, their attitudes and knowledge
about the use of English with political correctness can reflect the reality and tendency of this
phenomenon.
Materials
The research instrument of this study was a set of questionnaires consisting of three parts:
general information, a 30-item multiple-choice test, and a survey. Interviews were also conducted
to gain qualitative data from the respondents.
Questionnaire
Part 1: General Information
This part asked for respondents’ demographic information: gender, age, occupation,
previous degree, and English test score. All of the respondents’ information was kept confidential.
Part 2: Test of the Use of English with Political Correctness.
The second part consisted of a 30-item test on different types of English vocabulary with
political correctness used in diverse situations featuring more than two choices and one blank line
for their own version. The types of vocabulary included gender, race/ethnicity, physical/mental
challenges, and other types of politically correct language. The choices were adapted from Lin’s
(2010) questionnaire.
The choices were not provided in an orderly sequence to prevent respondents from
guessing the objectives of the experimental procedure according to Lambert (1967) (as cited in
Lin, 2010).
Part 3: Opinions and Attitudes
The third part of the test was 25 questions that asked for respondents’ opinions and
attitudes towards the use of English with political correctness. The questionnaire was adapted from
the Language Attitudes Survey from the Chickasaw Nation (2006), Cherokee Nation (2002),
Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California (n.d), Hinton (2001), which has been used to survey the
attitudes towards the importance of languages. Thus, in this research, the term ‘language’ in the
former survey was modified to ‘politically correct language’ with adapted questions in three main
topics: (1) attitudes towards the importance of politically correct language, (2) opinions towards
the practical use of politically correct language, and (3) limitations, negative attitudes towards the
use of politically correct language. All of the answers were based on a scale of 1–5.
The data, which was analyzed by the SPSS program, showed the degree of opinions
through the range of the mean score values. The mean scores were classified into five interval
scales based on the study of Srisa-ard (2010).
The criteria for determining the degree of opinions are shown in Table 1

Interviews
Semi-structured interviews were conducted, which is a qualitative method of inquiry that
combines a pre-determined set of open questions with the opportunity for the interviewer to
explore particular themes or further responses. The interviews were conducted anonymously with
five respondents.
The questions of the interview were about the definition of politically correct language,
opinions about the use of English language with political correctness, opinions about political
correctness in English and Thai language, and the use of language with political correctness in real
life. The basic questions were adapted from Lin (2010)
Reseach Procedures
Research Design
The data was collected from five students who were studying in the second year of a
master’s degree program as a pilot study to check the quality of the test and questionnaire. These
five students were not considered as a population for this study.
Data Collection
After a pilot study and the test enhancement, 100 hard copies of the test and questionnaire
were distributed to 100 students and they were asked to return them the same day. The interviews
were recorded and transcribed for further data analysis.
Data Analysis
The quantitative data from the questionnaires, i.e., the English with politically correct
language test and the opinions and attitudes survey, were analyzed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences Program (SPSS) to calculate the frequency, percentage, and mean.
Frequency and percentage were used to describe participants’ personal data. The test consisted of
30 questions covering three main types of political correctness; (1) Gender (2) Race, Ethnicity (3)
Physical, Mental Challenges, and also other types of political correctness. Meanwhile, the
questionnaire was constructed based on a Likert-type scale. The researcher adapted the rating
format from Gardner’s Attitude/Motivation Test Battery as a five-point Likert-type scale. The
qualitative data, i.e., the interviews and opinions, were also interpreted for further results and
discussion.

Findings and Discussion
Questionnaire Results
Test on the Use of English with Political Correctness
From 100 respondents, the highest score was 28, the lowest score was 9, and the average
score was 18.45.
Gender
It can be seen that most of the respondents used politically correct language in the genderinclusive sentence (97% in item1) but they used less gender-inclusive versions of words that have
–man suffix; such as, ‘artificial’ (69%), ‘police officer’ (68%), ‘businessperson’ (55%),
‘humankind’ (43%), ‘mail carrier’ (33%). Likewise, only 51% of respondents used ‘folks/friends’
to refer to a mixed group instead of using ‘guys’. However, respondents used the more neutral
word for occupations such as ‘cabin crew/ flight attendant’ (84%).
Race/ Ethnicity
Most respondents used the politically correct version in this category: 96% for
‘Taiwanese/Chinese Taipei’, 84% for ‘American Indian/Native American’ and ‘Asian’, and 71%
for ‘African people’. Moreover, the word ‘blacklisted’, which is considered a politically incorrect
as the term ‘black’ is used with a negative meaning, was still used more than the alternative
version; ‘banned’(42%).
Physical, Mental Challenges
A total of 73% of respondents used the politically correct version of ‘disabled
people/physically challenged people’, 68% used ‘differently sized person/larger-than-average
person’, 67% used ‘intellectual disability/late developer’, 63% used ‘plain-looking/cosmetically
different’, 58% used ‘mature person/senior citizen’ and ‘hearing-impaired/hard-of-hearing’.
Meanwhile, only 37% of respondents used the politically correct version of an ‘opticallychallenged person’ and ‘vertically-challenged person’.
Others
In this category, the test aimed to examine various types of politically correct language.
Most respondents used politically correct versions of the following situations: 98% chose
‘homeless person/displaced homeowner’, 82% used ‘developing country’ 80% used ‘pass
away/return to dust’, 64% used ‘economically disadvantaged/low-income’. Notably, only 51%
used ‘substandard housing’ instead of ‘slum’.
On the other hand, 43% of respondents would list the names of international leaders in
alphabetical order, 40% used ‘undocumented immigrant/undocumented alien’, 28% used ‘lacking
a formal education’, while only 13% used the term ‘sex worker’.

An Analysis of the Use of English with Political Correctness

Phumsiri & Tangkiengsirisin

Interview Results
There was a total of eight questions that the interviewees were asked to elaborate on their
opinions based on four topics:
(1) Definition of Politically correct language
(2) Opinions about the Use of Language with Political Correctness
(3) Opinions about Political Correctness in English and Thai Language
(4) The Use of language with Political Correctness in Real Life
Definition of Politically correct language
The result showed that political correctness and politically correct language are not
clearly defined and their meanings seem to be different according to individuals. Participants
viewed the use of this kind of language as a tool to avoid conflicts and promote equality. One
interviewee said “in my understanding, politically correct language is language that has no
discriminate sense whether it is in terms of sex, race or socio-economic status which is basically
considered as a liberalist language” and the other’s opinion was “due to my understanding about
political correctness, it is the term used to describe avoidance of using offensive languages toward
sensitive issues; gender, ethnicity, color discrimination, and etc.” As a result, it can be summarized
that the interviewees had basic knowledge about politically correct language as a language for
equality and they had positive attitudes towards politically correct language.
However, the interviewees understood and defined the term ‘politically correct language’
as the language used for specific purposes and they viewed politically correct language that it is
not a normal method of communication with general people.
Opinions about the Use of Language with Political Correctness
Participants’ opinions towards the use of language with political correctness were, in
general, positive. They saw language with political correctness as a tool to promote equality and
produce good impacts on individuals and society in relation to the development of critical thinking.
However, they still viewed political correctness as a limited phenomenon; only a few groups of
people, mostly urban and some educated people, were aware and enthusiastic about promoting and
developing this kind of language. Likewise, the use of language with political correctness is
viewed as something new for society in general and sometimes it could be overused.
Opinions about Political Correctness in English and Thai Language
In this part, the participants were asked to give opinions about the use of political
correctness, specifically in terms of English and Thai languages. In the case of English language,
a participant stated that “I think political correctness started in the Western world. Therefore, PC
in the English language is pretty clear in itself. We can easily differentiate PC and non-PC terms”
However, other interviewees viewed political correctness in English as confusing and unclear
language despite having good objectives and some words are not required to be gender-inclusive
if we know the gender of the mentioned person already. For example, we can use ‘businesswoman’
if the person is a woman or ‘fireman’ if that person is a man.
In the case of Thai language, the interviewees found it difficult to think about some
examples; some interviewees said they could not find any examples about the use of political

correctness in Thai language and Thai people tend not to be interested in developing their language
with political correctness. In relation to the society, one interviewer viewed political correctness
in the Thai language in a way that “the sense of PC that is originally from Thai language doesn't
exist because we didn't have a history of marginalized people who fought for themselves like in
the West. Some interviewees also said that it is difficult to find examples because the Thai
language is already gender-inclusive and it had no difference between the use of political
correctness in Thai and English language as it depends on the intentions and how people are
educated about such terms. This interviewee also mentioned that many Thai people were still not
aware that the term ‘negro’ is offensive and she also gave an example that “while people of other
races cannot call colored people ‘negro’ or ‘nigga’, colored people can call each other with these
words without feeling offended.
However, some interviewees said that the media has a lot of influence on the use of
language with political correctness. For example, they said that while many in the Western media
were aware of politically correct language, some famous Thai media still write their headlines with
offensive and non-PC language.
The Use of language with Political Correctness in Real Life
The interviewees stated that the difficulty is that English with political correctness
sometimes has unfamiliar terms and vocabulary, which might cause misunderstanding. Moreover,
people can eventually ignore the use of such terms as one interviewee said that “it contrasts to the
standard of language, so to replace the new set of words into people daily lives will be a problem”.
Meanwhile, another interviewee also emphasized the importance of the agenda of the speakers as
mentioned in case of the term ‘black’ and ‘colored’ people in the previous topic. The other problem
stated by the interviewee is that language with political correctness can sometimes be overused
which can be harmful to the speakers themselves as an interviewee said that “listeners might be
confusing and eventually lose credibility and interest”.
Lastly, the interviewees were asked whether they would use the English language with political
correctness once they had already studied it. All interviewees said that they would use politically
correct language if they had knowledge about it. However, they would only use some words that
they considered very sensitive and that normal people would understand.
Conclusion
According to the findings, it can be concluded that master’s degree students in a
university in Bangkok, Thailand are able to use certain politically correct words and terms
correctly. However, the correctness depends on the familiarity of the respondents regardless of the
categories of politically correct language, same as the study of Andrews (1996) which shows that
political correctness was caused by powerful socio-cultural movements and it reflected the
dynamic interplay of linguistic signs within changing social contexts.
Meanwhile, respondents have positive attitudes toward the use of politically correct
language and they considered this type of language as a formal and respectful language.
Accordingly, their opinions showed that English with political correctness should be implemented
in workplaces and certain fields. The result about the attitudes towards the use of English with

political correctness is related to study of Goncalo et al (2015), which mentioned that the political
correctness norm, which is often maligned as a threat to free speech, may play an important role
in promoting gender parity at work by allowing demographically heterogeneous work groups to
more freely exchange creative ideas. In this study, the participants viewed political correctness as
a peace maker and it should be promoted in a workplace. However, the threat of political
correctness could occur when it is overused. The interview results also showed that if they had
studied about politically correct language, the respondents would be willing to use this type of
language but limited to certain terms only which relates to the SWOT analysis of the political
correctness phenomenon, which holds that political correctness can help people with an awareness
of political correctness in career advancement and create a good workplace environment
(Marques, 2009).
