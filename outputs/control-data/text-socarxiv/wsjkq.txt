Market Depth and Risk Return Analysis of Dhaka Stock
Exchange: An Empirical Test of Market Efficiency
Abstract
It is customary that when security prices fully reflect all available information, the
markets for those securities are said to be efficient. And if markets are inefficient,
investors can use available information ignored by the market to earn abnormally high
returns on their investments. In this context this paper tries to find evidence supporting
the reality of weak-form efficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by examining
the issues of market risk-return relationship and market depth or liquidity for DSE. The
study uses a data set of daily market index and returns for the period of 1994 to 2005 and
weekly market capital turnover in proportion of total market capital for the period of
1994 to 2005. The paper also looks about the market risk (systemic risk) and return where
it is found that market rate of return of DSE is very low or sometimes negative.
Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which envisages the relationship
between risk and the expected rate of return on a risky security, is found unrelated in
DSE market. As proper risk-return relationships of the market is seems to be deficient in
DSE and the market is not liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being
very insignificant. All these issues are very noteworthy to the security analysts, investors
and security exchange regulatory bodies in their policy making decisions to progress the
market condition.
Key-Words: Market Efficiency, Dhaka Stock Exchange and Capital Asset Pricing Model

Introduction
Emerging markets are typically characterized by low liquidity, unreliable information and
considerable volatility. If there is any wrong information or the flow of information is not
rapid, or the price is not adjusted to the information, then that market would cease to be
considered as an inefficient market. Good investors always look for investing in an
efficient market, therefore a significant number of buyers and sellers are available in an
efficient market and the overall market transaction turns very high.
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and the empirical tests of the hypothesis can be
divided based on the information set involved: Weak-form EMH, Semi-strong form EMH
and Strong-form EMH. Weak-form market efficiency hypothesis (EMH) states that the
stock returns are serially un-correlated and have a constant mean. In other words, a
market is considered weak form efficient if current prices fully reflect all information
contained in historical prices, which implies that no investor can devise a trading rule
based solely on past price patterns to earn abnormal returns. Whereas, the semi- strong
form EMH means that securities prices adjust rapidly based on all public information and
the strong-form EMH contends that stock prices fully reflect all private and public
information.
There are two types of risk in capital market investment- uncontrollable or systematic
risk (non-diversifiable) and controllable or unsystematic risk (diversifiable). When
1

determining the risk of a share, investor only looks on controllable risk that can be
measured by Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) model, which is one of the widely
used methods of assets valuation. If the market returns gives wrong indication CAPM
model will not work perfectly. This indicates high inefficiency of the market.
One of the important efficiency indicators of the market is liquidity or Market Depth.
Market Depth means numerous buyers and sellers are available in the market. As a result
potential buyers and sellers are easily found at any time for transaction of any company’s
share. For that reason in the market radical price change is prevented. It can be measured
by observing transaction values proportion out of total market capital. If this proportion is
high, then the market indicates its depth is also high.
Several relevant studies revealed that the markets in developing and less developed
countries are not efficient in semi-strong form or strong form. The test of semi strong
form and strong form efficiency is found insignificant in less developed countries. So, the
study investigates to find out the facts whether the Dhaka Stock Exchange follows
random walk model or the market is weak form efficient. The researcher also tried to find
out the Market Risk Return relationship and the frequency of Market Depth on Dhaka
Stock Exchange.

Literature Review
Early findings on market efficiency differ among researchers. Fama (1965), Samuelson
(1965), and Working (1960) used random walk model and found market is efficient.
Shiller (1989) shown that stock prices do follow a random walk and also explained the
reason behind the behavior of the stock prices. Niederhoffer & Osborne (1966) found an
early rejection of a random walk model. Poterba & Summers (1988) argued that there is
little theoretical basis for strong attachment to the null hypothesis that stock prices follow
a random walk. Lo & MacKinlay (1988) investigated the sampling distributions of
variance ratios over different sampling intervals and found that stock returns do not
follow a random walk. Claessens (1995) in a world bank study reported significant serial
correlation in equity returns from 19 emerging markets and suggested that stock prices in
emerging markets violates weak form EMH. Poshakwale (1996) found the evidence of
non-randomness stock price behavior and the market inefficiency (not weak-form
efficient) on the Indian market. Khababa (1998) has examined the behavior of stock price
in the Saudi Financial market seeking the evidence for weak-form efficiency and found
that the market was not weak-form efficient. He explained that the inefficiency might be
due to delay in operations and high transaction cost, thinness of trading and illiquidity in
the market.
Surprisingly researchers also find different types of results while working on the same
market. Jammine and Hawkins (1974), Hadassin (1976) and Du Toit (1986) reject weakform efficiency, but Affleck-Graves and Money (1975), Gilbertson and Roux (1977,
1978) found weak-form efficiency; Knight and Afflect-Graves (1983) rejected semistrong form efficiency but Knight, Afflect-Graves and Hamman (1985) showed semistrong form efficiency; Gilbertson (1976) found evidence supporting strong-form
efficiency, but Knight and Firer (1989) rejected the strong-form efficiency on
2

Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Harvey (1993) stated that stock returns of emerging
countries are highly predictable and have low correlation with stock returns of developed
countries. He concluded that emerging markets are less efficient than developed markets
and that higher return and low risk can be obtained by incorporating emerging market
stocks in investors’ portfolios. Balaban 1995, Urrutia 1995, Grieb & Reyes 1999,
Kawakatsu & Morey 1999 showed non randomness of stock prices for emerging markets.
Few studies have already been conducted on Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Hassan
(1999) studied on time-varying risk return relationship for Bangladesh by utilizing a
unique data set of daily stock prices and returns. The result found that DSE equity returns
held positive skewness, excess kurtosis and deviation from normality and the returns
displayed significant serial correlation, implying the stock market is inefficient. Mobarek
(2000) concluded that Dhaka Stock Exchange does not follow random walk model and
there are significant autocorrelation causes to DSE is not weak form efficient. Their result
did not change for different sub-sample observations, without outlier, and for individual
securities. Haque (2001) worked on the cumulative abnormal profit on the study period.
He described the experience of DSE after the scam of November 1996 by applying
CAPM and EMH. Based on the data four months before and four months after the
automation, the paper measured risk-return performance, estimated SML for big capital
and small capital companies before and after automation and tested EMH. The test results
indicated that the market does not improve, and even after automation manipulation
continued.
Kader (2005) has no evidence that Dhaka Stock Exchange is weak form efficient by
testing whether any technical trading strategy yielded abnormal profit or not by using
technical trading rule (K% filter rule). Islam (2005) analyzed on the predictability of the
share price in Dhaka Stock Exchange prior to the boom in 1996 and by using
heteroscedasticity-robust tests found evidence in favor of short-term predictability of
share prices in the Dhaka stock market prior to the 1996 boom, but not during the postcrash period. After thorough investigation it was concluded that the Securities and
Exchange Commission were able to give more transparency of the Dhaka Stock
Exchange by taking various steps. Uddin and Alam (2007) examines the linear
relationship between share price and interest rate, share price and growth of interest rate,
growth of share price and interest rate, and growth of share price and growth of interest
rate were determined through ordinary least-square (OLS) regression. For all of the cases,
included and excluded outlier, they found that Interest Rate has significant negative
relationship with Share Price and Growth of Interest Rate has significant negative
relationship with Growth of Share Price in Dhaka Stock Market so that DSE is not weak
form efficient.

Data, Model and Methodology
The study uses a data set of 3,209 daily observations on market index and returns for the
period of 1994 to 2005 and 3,057 weekly observations on market capital turnover in
proportion of total market capital for the period of 1994 to 2005. These data are collected
from Dhaka Stock Exchange.

To test the EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis) of DSE, the tools of stationarity (Unit
Root Test) of share prices is tested by using daily market returns. DSE prepares daily
price index from daily weighted-average price of daily transaction of each stock. Daily
market returns (Rt) are calculated from the daily price indices such as follows:
R t = Ln (PI t / PI t-1)
(1)
Where,
R t = market return at period t;
PI t = price index at period t;
PI t-1= the price index at period t-1 and
ln = natural log.
While calculating the market return (Eq-1) for the efficiency test logarithm is used
because it is justified by both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, logarithmic
returns are analytically more tractable when linking returns over longer intervals.
Empirically, logarithmic returns are more likely to be normally distributed which is a
prior condition of standard statistical techniques (Strong 1992).
CAPM model can be viewed both as a mathematical equation and graphically as Security
Market Line (SML) which shows the relationship between risk and return. The
significance of CAPM model is analyzed for determining expected returns in respect of
risk of an investor.
CAPM Model: Kj = Krf + βj (Km - Krf)
Here,
Kj = Return for the jth Security,
Krf = Risk Free Rate
βj = Individual Company Risk,
Km = Expected Return for the market

(2)

To determine the market depth for DSE, descriptive statistics and the ratio of Market
Capital to Market Turnover is analyzed for the mentioned period.

Empirical Result and Discussion
Randomness of market return
The statistical output of unit root test for market return series suggests that there are serial
dependencies of return of Dhaka Stock Exchange. ADF calculated values are significant
at 1% level for all 10 degrees of freedom (lags) suggests that the return series does not
follow random walk model (Table-1) that means DSE is not efficient in weak form.

Market risk-return relationships
The DSE market indicates an opposite direction from rationality. Long term observations
of twelve years based on daily capital return from the market shows the index is very
low; on an average daily basis return is 0.0442% and for short term sometimes it was
negative. While excluding the outlier, based on 3057 observations, the return turns lower
to 0.0139%. This may cause a rational investor to be less interested to invest in this
market.

If the market return gives wrong indication (e.g. very low or negative return) CAPM
model never works perfectly. Beta measures non-diversifiable or systematic risk and the
beta for the market is 1. In such cases, when market provides very low or negative return,
expected returns of high risky company will become negative. Bangladesh government
T-bill rate (Krf) is 5%, DSE market return is .0442%, and suppose ‘j’ company’s beta is
1.5. For this ‘j’ company, expected return will be {5+1.5(.0442-4.5)} = -1.68%. Thus,
when market provides negative return (Km), CAPM model provides negative expected
return for high risky company, which is irrational. A company with a high risk should
5

provide comparatively a high return, but for the reason of a low market return CAPM
model shows wrong expected return for that company. This indicates DSE is an
inefficient market.
Frequency of the market depth
From the weekly observations of twelve years on DSE, average daily transaction (BDT)
to total market capital is only 0.1539%. On the other hand, as one of the most efficient
markets, NYSE average daily capital transaction of total market capital is over 100%.
Though NYSE is considered as a model of efficient market and it is totally different from
DSE, NYSE’s daily capital transaction of its total market capital is more than 500 times
higher of DSE. This very low amount of turnover indicates DSE market is not liquid
enough. As a result, a significant number of buyers and sellers are not available in the
DSE and active investors in DSE are very few.

High Standard Deviation means- daily capital transaction of total market capital is
fluctuating more from its mean (average). It shows an indication that there may be
enough passive investors in that market, and when passive investors execute their equity
then market turnover will be high and the market would fluctuate more. But the standard
deviation of daily capital transaction of total market capital is 0.00147 in weekly average
basis, indicating DSE’s passive investors is also very small. So, both active and passive
types of investors are highly absent in DSE.

In risk-return analysis it is mentioned that when the market return is negative or very low,
no rational investor will invest at that market. Rational investors will switch to another
market where they can get more return bearing same risk level. In Bangladesh the interest
rate is very high (government T-bill 4.5%, savings account interest 6%) in proportion to
share market risk free return (average 0.0442%). So investors keep their money in the
bank or invest in other sectors rather than investing in the stock market. This is the reason
why the commercial banks hold more than ten thousand crores taka idle money at
present. As a consequence, significant buyers and sellers are not available in the market
and the market liquidity or market depth is very low. As a result, potential buyers and
sellers are not found at any time for transaction of any company’s share, and dramatic
price change cannot be prevented. Ultimately DSE is also found inefficient for lacking of
enough liquidity (market depth).

Conclusion
The significance of this research is to find out the efficiency of the Dhaka Stock
Exchange (DSE) through analyzing the randomness of market return, market risk-return
relationships and the frequency of the market depth or liquidity. To the best of the
researcher’s knowledge, this is a new study of measuring market efficiency through
market depth and risk- return relationship. The paper found that DSE is not efficient, and
the CAPM is not working in this market. Under this circumstance, a new model of asset
valuation is highly recommended to develop for the emerging market. In Bangladesh the
interest rate is very high in respect of capital market return so that investors keep their
money in the bank or invest in other sectors rather than investing in the stock market. As
a result, available traders are not found at any time for transactions.
This study is useful for a number of reasons. The results of this study will be of great
interest to academics, policy makers and local and foreign listed and unlisted companies.
Moreover, globalization in the world economy has created an enormous opportunity for
the investors to diversify their portfolios across the globe. As a result, this study
examining the efficiency and other characteristics of DSE markets would be of great
benefit to investors at home and abroad. Finally, it may also be useful for international
organizations (such as the World Bank, IMF, WTO) and governments of development
partners who are interested in the development of capital markets in the emerging
countries.
