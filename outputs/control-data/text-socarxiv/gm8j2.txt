Abstract
Mobile home residence in the United States is associated with negative social, economic, and
health related outcomes. However, while research on mobile home residence at the individual
level has been performed, a geographic understanding of mobile home prevalence in the United
States remains absent from the literature. Therefore, the purpose of our analysis was to evaluate
the county-level drivers of mobile home prevalence in the continental United States in 2015. The
influence of five groups of variables – demographic, economic, housing, industry and
occupation, and natural amenities – were assessed in a series of nested OLS regressions.
Additionally, the full model was run as a spatial lag regression to control for spatial
autocorrelation. Our results indicate that the primary drivers of mobile home prevalence in U.S.
counties were the percent of population near poverty, the labor force participation rate, and the
percent of the population employed in natural resource occupations.

Introduction
Mobile homes are often found on the perimeter of communities, hidden from sight and
out of the minds of many Americans. This hidden nature of mobile homes, sometimes called
trailers or manufactured housing, is rooted in their status as an undesirable housing option
(Morgan & Hart, 1995). Mobile homes and their collective neighborhoods, often called trailer
parks, are viewed in many communities as places of crime, as unattractive, and are often viewed

as detrimental to the value of neighboring properties (Wubneh & Shen, 2004; MacTavish, 2007;
McCarty, 2014). Those who live in this housing type are likely to experience social stigma and
isolation as well as financial instability via high rates of eviction and a lack of legal protections
(MacTavish, 2007, Kusenback, 2009; Desmond, 2012; Sullivan, 2017b). Juxtaposed with these
adverse outcomes is the fact that mobile homes are a significant source of affordable housing in
the United States and account for a significant portion of the growth in this sector of the housing
market (Boehm & Schlottmann, 2008; Sullivan, 2017b). This combination of social stigma and
affordable housing should make understanding the factors that drive mobile home prevalence in
communities a chief priority for both policymakers and social science researchers. Understanding
why mobiles are more likely to be located in some communities compared to others has merit in
numerous disciplines, but most importantly, it may lead to a better understanding of where large
numbers of individuals are facing long-term financial and social challenges in regard to their
housing choices.
Although most researchers have traditionally ignored mobile homes, there has been a
recent resurgence in scholarly interest with books like Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the
American City (Desmond, 2016) and Singlewide: Chasing the American Dream in a Rural
Trailer Park (Salamon & MacTavish, 2017). In general, most scholarly work on mobile homes
has tried to understand the hardships faced by occupants, either financial, social, or
environmental; yet there has been limited attention given to the geographic distribution of mobile
homes and their prevalence given relevant social and economic indicators.
Some studies have examined mobile home locations and change over time at a municipal
level (Wubneh & Shen, 2004; Shen; 2005; Sullivan, 2017b). However, there is a missing
national-level understanding of mobile home prevalence. At first glance, mobile homes appear

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

prevalent in many Sunbelt counties, as well as in rural counties with high levels of poverty
(Figure 1, Figure 2). This southern bias is in line with the extant academic literature which
describes the historic nature of mobile homes as located in more friendly climates (Hart, Rhodes,
& Morgan, 2002). Mobile homes also appear to be prevalent in rural counties with high levels of
poverty, possibly due to mobile homes being reserved for those with low incomes, However, the
general notion that high poverty should lead to a higher percentage of mobile homes does not
appear to provide the full explanation for the relative density of mobile homes in all regions
(Figure 1, Figure 2). There are many places of traditionally high poverty, chiefly the Mississippi
Delta and Texas Borderlands, where one may expect higher percentages of mobile homes if
poverty was the key driver of mobile home prevalence. Additionally, mobile homes are prevalent
in many regions not associated with persistent poverty, such as Florida and many Mountain-West
counties (Lichter and Johnson, 2007; Thiede, Kim, & Valasik 2017), further demonstrating that
poverty may not be the primary driver of mobile home prevalence. While those who are poor
often inhabit mobile homes, not all of those who are poor live in mobile homes. Due to the
adverse social, stigmatic, and health-based outcomes of mobile home residence, the purpose of
our analysis was to assess which ecological factors lead to an increased mobile home prevalence
at the county level.
FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE
Our analysis was exploratory by design and was rooted in the limited past scholarship
that has looked at determinants of mobile home prevalence at the county level. Mobile homes are
prevalent in rural areas, yet they are not inherently a rural phenomenon (George & Barr, 2005).
The widespread nature of mobile homes gives further credence to the need for a national study
looking at determinants of mobile home prevalence. Although the intersection of poverty and

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

mobile home residency has been a topic of past work, most of this research has only focused on
the adverse outcomes associated between the two. There is much research looking at the
interaction between housing policy, community housing stock, and mobile homes. This research
has emphasized the affordability of mobile homes and the need for policies to help ease the
financial and legal burden associated with mobile home ownership (Aman & Yarnal, 2010;
Sullivan, 2014; Sullivan, 2017a).
A predictive model of mobile home prevalence has yet to be estimated. Based on
previous research it is likely that demographic, economic, and housing-related factors will
influence mobile home prevalence. Beyond these factors, there are three other dimensions we felt
were likely to influence mobile home prevalence. Industry and occupational factors were
included to investigate the impact that industrial presence has on mobile home prevalence. Of
particular interest was the natural resource sector.
The natural resource industry carries with it a boom and bust history where local
economies and populations spike with increases in development and then plummet shortly after
(Kinchy et al., 2014). These forces are likely to influence the need, and therefore prevalence, of
cheap and affordable temporary housing such as mobile homes (MacTavish, Ziebarth, & George,
2014). In addition to the boom and bust impacts on housing stock, there is also the phenomenon
of man camps, wherein natural resource and agricultural companies provide temporary housing
in the form of mobile homes for their employees (Briody, 2017; Lyons, 2013; MacTavish et al.,
2014; Sulzberger, 2011). Man camps, and other forms of temporary housing, are likely to have
an impact on the prevalence of mobile homes at the county level. Finally, the transitory nature of
employment in this sector, as well as the abundance of low-income and unemployed individuals
drawn to boomtowns looking for work (Briody, 2017), could influence mobile home prevalence.

Beyond the possible influence of natural resource industries, the literature suggests
mobile homes go hand in hand with natural amenity related development, and are likely
influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, aridity, and topography (Morgan &
Hart, 1995; Hackenberg & Benequista, 2001). Finally, given the spatial clustering tendencies of
poverty, development, and policy in the United States, it is also likely that mobile home
prevalence is spatially clustered, which indicates the need for spatial econometric models.
Research Questions
Based on prior scholarship we believe that mobile home density may be influenced by
demographic, economic, housing, industry and occupational, and natural amenity characteristics.
Our analysis was guided by six research questions:
R1: What county-level demographic characteristics have a significant relationship with
mobile home prevalence?
R2: What county-level economic characteristics have a significant relationship with mobile
home prevalence?
R3: What county-level housing characteristics have a significant relationship with mobile home
prevalence?
R4: What related county-level industry and occupational characteristics have a significant
relationship with mobile home prevalence?
R5: What county-level natural amenity characteristics have significant relationship with
mobile home prevalence?
R6: How does the inclusion of spatial modeling affect our understanding of mobile home
prevalence?

Background Literature
The most heavily cited negative outcome associated with living in mobile homes is social
stigma and social isolation. The term ‘trailer trash’ is often used to describe those living in
mobile home communities. Often meant as a derogatory term, the term refers to one’s low
income and undesirable lifestyle (Kusenbach, 2009). This social stigma often extends into
schools, limiting children’s educational outcomes, and the attainment of public services (Miller
& Evko, 1985; Notter, MacTavish, & Shamah, 2008; MacTavish, 2007; MacTavish & Salamon,
2007). Children who live in mobile home communities may also be unwelcome in a variety of
educational and community activities. Social isolation has been shown to increase due to the
presumed, but not necessarily accurate (Aman & Yarnal, 2010), temporary nature of living in a
mobile home and the lack of public spaces and amenities provided in mobile home communities
(MacTavish & Salamon, 2009). Something of note is that the positive social effects of
homeownership, something that is widely valued by many Americans, are not felt by all who
own mobile homes, with Hispanic immigrants being more likely to see mobile home ownership
as an accomplishment to be proud of than other groups (Kusenbach, 2017).
The second area of unfavorable outcomes for mobile home residents is financial and
legal. In many states, those who live in mobile homes lack the legal protections that prevent
speedy evictions and displacement (Aman & Yarnal, 2010; Sullivan, 2014; Desmond, 2016;
Sullivan, 2017a). A complicating factor in the legal rights of mobile homeowners is the fact that
while most mobile home residents own the structure they live in, they do not own the land, or
‘pad,’ the mobile home is sited on (Housing Assistance Council, 2011). This combination of
ownership of the structure, but leasing of the land, leads to mobile home residents being at
constant risk of pad-fee increases and pseudo-evictions due to unaffordable increases to rent

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

7

imposed by the owner of the mobile home community. This process of eviction only further
continues the cycle of poverty, and often disqualifies one from living in public housing or living
in more desirable neighborhoods (Desmond, 2012; Desmond, 2016). However, there are a few
states, mainly in the Northeast, that give stronger legal protections to mobile home residents
(Sullivan, 2017b).
There has been a devolution of the responsibility to enforce or provide tenant rights,
specifically in the case of mobile-homeowners, from state governments to local governments in
the United States. Local governments are much more likely to get rid of tenant rights to
encourage new development, which further increases the burden on those living in mobile homes
(Sullivan, 2014). Further, mobile home residents are systemically suspect to predatory or
unfavorable loans; which limits resident’s financial opportunities (MacTavish, Eley, & Salamon,
2006). Mobile homes, unlike traditional single-family homes, do not appreciate in value over
time, which further compounds these financial problems (Kusenback, 2009).
Mobile homes are often unwanted in communities and in response, many municipalities
have set up strict zoning laws to limit their prevalence (Mandelker, 2016). Outside of general
NIMBYism (Not-In-My-Back-Yard) concerns, many believe that mobile homes increase crime
and lower the value of neighboring properties (Davis & Bali, 2008; Sullivan, 2017b). The fear of
increased crime in areas with mobile homes is unfounded in the literature, with neighborhoods
containing mobile home communities not having statistically higher crime rates than surrounding
neighborhoods (McCarty, 2010; McCarty, 2014). However, mobile homes do potentially reduce
the property values of traditional single-family homes near mobile home communities (Munneke
& Slawson, 1999; Wubneh & Shen, 2004). Overall, community resistance towards mobile home

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

8

communities has pushed the location of mobile home communities near the outskirts of many
U.S. cities (Shen, 2005; Sullivan, 2017b; McTavish, 2007).
Due to the geographic isolation of mobile home communities, many mobile home
residents are located farther away from services, such as hospitals, police, schools, compared to
those living in other types of housing (Shen, 2005). Mobile homes are more likely to be prevalent
in floodplains, which is both an environmental and financial risk (Shen, 2005). The disapproval
of mobile homes has led to the removal of mobile home communities in many areas, often as part
of broader redevelopment plans, resulting in gentrification (Sullivan, 2014;
Sullivan, 2017b).
While we have discussed many negatives, there are positives of living in a mobile home;
chiefly stability and affordability. Contrary to the dominant narrative, those who typically live in
mobile homes own their homes and stay there for an extended period. The majority of mobile
home owners in one study lived in their mobile home for over ten years (Aman & Yarnal, 2010).
Mobile home residents are also far less mobile than traditional renters, which may have positive
community impacts (Boehm & Schlottmann, 2008). Despite the name, most mobile homes are
not mobile, and the majority have never been moved after their original build (Aman & Yarnal,
2010; Sullivan, 2017b). Further, mobile homes are places of racial integration, which may
encourage positive community building (Benson, 1990).
As previously mentioned, mobile homes are one of the largest sources of affordable
housing in the United States, and they are the largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing
(Sullivan, 2017b). Due to this, the Department of Housing and Urban Development endorses
mobile homes as a source of affordable housing (Sullivan, 2017b, Boehm & Schlottmann, 2008).
An unusual subsect of mobile home development is the creation of upscale mobile home

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

9

communities aimed at retirees (Morgan & Hart, 1995; Hart et al., 2002). These new mobile home
communities are often located in retirement destination cities in Sunbelt states. In general, this
trend breaks the mold of what traditionally defines a mobile home community and its location.
It is important to note that although mobile home residence is associated with negative
outcomes, the housing unit itself does not often causes these outcomes. The location of mobile
homes in communities, the policies surrounding their ownership, and the social stigma all drive
the negative impacts for those that reside in manufactured housing. Therefore, while we
investigated mobile home prevalence to increase our understanding of mobile homes in the
United States, and believe this research is vital due to the documented negative impacts of living
in a mobile home, increasing the number of individuals living in mobile homes is not by itself a
negative. Given the multitude of impacts presented, we produced a series of models predicting
county-level mobile home prevalence in the continental United States in the year of 2015.
Data and Methods
The data compiled for our analysis came from five primary sources: The 2011-2015 and
2006-2001 American Community Survey (ACS), the 1980-2010 Decennial Censuses, and the
United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) Rural-Urban
Continuum Codes (RUCC; Parker, 2013) and Natural Amenity Scales (McGranahan, 1999). Our
data from the ACS and the Decennial Census were extracted using the National Historical
Geographic Information System from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
(NHGISIPUMS; Manson, Schroeder, Van Riper, & Ruggles, 2017). In addition to the database
output, we also extracted the corresponding 2015 county shapefiles for spatial analysis. We
extracted data for all continental counties within the United States, except for four counties,
which we excluded due to their boundaries changing over the period of analysis. Except for

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

10

population change over time, all variables were collected for the year of 2015 whenever possible.
Some relatively time-invariant variables were last updated before 2015, and where this occurred
it has been noted.
Dependent Variable
Our dependent variable in this analysis was the percentage of all 2015 households within a
county who live in mobile homes. This variable comes from the 2011-2015 ACS estimates and is
coded based upon household responses as either residing in a mobile home or trailer or not.
Independent Variables
Independent variables can be divided into five groups: (1) demographic, (2) economic, (3)
housing, (4) industry and occupation, and (5) natural amenities.
Demographic. We included county-level demographic variables expected to affect
mobile home density based on previous research (George & Barr, 2005, Salamon & McTavish,
2016). The variables included in our model were metro/nonmetro, which was calculated based
upon 2013 RUCC codes (Parker, 2013), population in 2015, population change from 2000 to
2015, and percent elderly (≥ 65) in 2015. We also included three ethnicity variables from 2015:
percent African American, percent Native American, and percent Hispanic. Further ethnicity
variables were not included to prevent redundancy in the model.

Economic. The siting of mobile homes is likely influenced by the economic
characteristics of a county. To account for this, we included seven indicators of county-level
economic prosperity. This included percent of population with at least a bachelor’s degree in
2015, whether or not a county was a persistent poverty county in 2010 (meaning that they had
greater than 20 percent poverty from 1980 – 2010), the percent of 2015 population receiving
public assistance, and percent of 2015 population near poverty at 150% of the poverty line. Two

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

11

labor force variables were also included: the 2015 labor force participation rate and the 2015
unemployment rate. We elected to use the near poverty measure, as opposed to a traditional
standard measure, to capture a broader range of relative economic disadvantage. Lastly, we
included the 2015 county-level Gini index – a measure of income inequality at the county level.
Housing. As our dependent variable in this model is the prevalence of a form of housing, we
included multiple county-level housing characteristics in our model. Due to the likelihood of
housing protection policy influencing the siting of mobile homes, we included a measure of
state-level housing protection policy from Sullivan (2017b). Data was from 2009 and counties
were coded as either residing in a state with policy protection for mobile homes or not. We also
included the 2015 percentage of households within a county that were renters and the percentage
of households within a county living in unaffordable housing – meaning the percent of
households spending more than 30% of their monthly income on housing. Finally, we included a
2015 measure of mobility, representing the percent of residents who had moved into, or within,
the county within the past year.
Industry and Occupation. A principal interest of our analysis was the influence that
industry and occupation may have on mobile home prevalence. Given the history of boomtowns
(Kinchy et al., 2014) and man camps (Lyons, 2013) related to natural resource industries, we
were particularly interested in agriculture and natural resource related employment. We included
three county-level industry and occupational variables from the 2011-2015 ACS estimates, the
percent of the population employed in agriculture and natural resource industries, the percent
employed in manufacturing industries, and the percent employed in natural resources and
construction occupations. It is important to note the distinction made by the U.S. Census Bureau

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

12

regarding industry and occupation. Industry represents, “the type of activity at a person’s place
of work,” while occupation represents, “the kind of work a person does to earn a living” (U.S.
Census Bureau, n.d.).
Natural Amenities. Mobile homes are more suitable for certain climates than others are;
additionally, they may generally be more prevalent in locations with higher natural amenities
(Hart et al., 2002). To investigate the environmental antecedents of mobile home prevalence, we
included all six items from the USDA-ERS Natural Amenities Scale (McGranahan, 1999). The
scale is comprised of six environmental characteristics and, while a composite scale is
preassembled, we elected to examine the effects of the environmental characteristics
individually. The most recent data from the USDA-ERS is at the county level and from 1999. It
includes average January temperature, average January hours of sun, average July temperature,
average July humidity, topographic variation, and water area. All of which were utilized as
Zscores, as produced by USDA-ERS.
Data Analysis
Six models were estimated to answer our six research questions. First, we performed a series of
five nested OLS regressions using Stata 14. Each block of variables was included as a separate
set to assess our guiding research questions. We evaluated the impacts of individual variables on
mobile home prevalence, as well as the set of variables’ overall contribution to the model by
testing the change in R-square (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). We assessed multicollinearity for
each model using a variance inflation factor (VIF) cut-off of five (Vaske, 2008).
To address our sixth research question concerning spatial analysis, we used GeoDa Space
to conduct a spatial lag regression (Anselin & Rey, 2014). A spatial lag regression was chosen
based on the produced diagnostics for spatial dependence from GeoDa Space for our fifth OLS

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

13

regression model. In a technical sense, a spatial lag regression incorporates the weighted average
of neighboring values, in this instance the weighted average of the percentage of mobile homes
in all neighboring counties for every county in the data set (Anselin & Rey, 2014). Spatial lag
was conducted using a first order queen’s weight’s matrix. The benefit of utilizing this type of
model is that it accounts for the spatial dependence of the dependent variable and therefore
accounts for peer effects within the model.
In addition to the six models presented in the paper, we also conducted a series of
sensitivity tests on our models that we do not report in this paper. These tests were conducted to
assess the stability of our models, as well as to evaluate the impacts of alternative measures for
similar constructs. First, we tested the model using the measures for poverty, industry, and
occupation as lagged effects from 2000 on mobile home prevalence in 2015. Second, we
included regional dummy variables for the South and the West. Third, we also estimated our
models using the traditional poverty measure, those living at or below the poverty line, and an
extreme poverty measure, those living at or below 50% of the poverty line. None of these
sensitivity tests substantively changed our model. Therefore, we have only reported our six main
models in our results.

Results
The final dataset contained 3108 counties within the continental United States. The
minimum percentage of mobile homes in a county was 0.0%, and the maximum was 60.17%, the
average mobile home prevalence was 12.54% with a standard deviation of 9.34%, and the
median mobile home prevalence was 10.41%. The global Moran’s I for the percentage of mobile
homes was very strong at .62; which indicated a need for a spatial regression model. Due to the

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

14

number of variables in our models, we have not provided a descriptive summary of each variable
in this paper.
The omnibus F-test for all models was significant at the p<.001 level, and each set of
variables added a significant increase of variance explained at p<.001 (Tables 1 & 2). Each
model was assessed for multicollinearity and all variables in all models were below our
designated cut-off of 5, with the exception of the percent of the population at 150% of the
poverty level, which was over 5, but less than 6 in models three, four, and five, and labor force
participation, which had a VIF of 5.2 for model five. Due to the importance of these variables
and the marginal nature of their VIF values, they were retained in the models.
TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE
R1: What county-level demographic characteristics have a significant relationship with
mobile home prevalence?
County-level demographic characteristics significantly predicted mobile home prevalence (Table
1). In total, six of the eight demographic variables had a significant relationship with mobile
home prevalence. The percentage of African Americans in a county had the strongest
relationship with mobile home prevalence, wherein a percentage of African American residents
relates to a higher prevalence of mobile homes. The 2015 population of a county had a strong
negative association with mobile home prevalence, meaning that higher levels of population in
2015 resulted in a lower prevalence of mobile homes.
R2: What county-level economic characteristics have a significant relationship with mobile
home prevalence?
County-level economic characteristics added a significant contribution to the model (R-square Δ
= .30, p<.001; Table 1). All of our economic variables were significant in the model, except

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

15

persistent poverty and the Gini index. The strongest relationship among economic characteristics
was between 2015 labor force participation rate and mobile home prevalence, as labor force
participation rate decreased, mobile home prevalence increased. With the inclusion of our
economic characteristics, a number of demographic effects decreased and were not significant in
the second model (Table 1).
R3: What county-level housing characteristics have a significant relationship with mobile
home prevalence?
Housing characteristics also added a significant increase in the variance explained in the model
(R-square Δ = .04, p<.001; Table 1). Three of the four housing variables were significant in the
model, with only the effect of 1-year mobility failing to be significantly different from zero. The
strongest relationship between housing characteristics and mobile home prevalence was for
percent of 2015 households renting their home, which had a negative relationship with mobile
home prevalence. The percent of households in unaffordable housing also had a negative
relationship with mobile home prevalence, meaning that as more people lived in unaffordable
housing the percentage of mobile homes went down. Housing protection policies had a negative
effect as well, wherein counties with mobile home protection policies had a lower prevalence of
mobile homes on average.
R4: What relevant county-level industry and occupational characteristics have a significant
relationship with mobile home prevalence?
The addition of our three industry and occupational variables added a significant increase in the
variance explained by the model (R Square Δ = .03, p<.001; Table 2). All three variables had a
significant impact in model four. The strongest relationship among the set of variables was the
positive effect of natural resource and construction occupation employment. As the percentage of

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

16

a county employed in natural resource and construction occupations increased, the prevalence of
mobile homes increased. Alternatively, as the percentage of agricultural and natural resource
industry employment and manufacturing industry employment increased, mobile home
prevalence decreased.
TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE
R5: What county-level natural amenity characteristics have a significant relationship with
mobile home prevalence?
The final non-spatial model added natural amenity characteristics, which significantly increased
the variance explained (R Square Δ = .04, p<.001; Table 2). Four of the seven variables had a
significant positive effect on mobile home prevalence. The most influential variable in the model
was the average January temperature, followed by the average July temperature. Average July
humidity and topographic variation did have a significant positive impact on mobile home
prevalence. With the inclusion of natural amenities, some relationships changed. The percent of a
population which is Hispanic had a significant negative relationship with mobile home
prevalence, and both the percentage of the population working in agriculture and natural resource
industries, as well as the manufacturing industry, had a weaker impact – with manufacturing
industry percent’s impact dropping out of the model altogether.
R6: How does the inclusion of spatial modeling affect our understanding of mobile home
prevalence?
Incorporating spatial lag effects into our model increased our explanation in the dependent
variable, with both the pseudo R Square and Spatial Pseudo R Square being the highest of any
model. The only new variable added to this model was weighted mobile home percentages,
which is highly significant and had relatively high non-standardized and standardized

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

17

coefficients. With the addition of these new variables, most previous variables kept their level of
statistical significance with two exceptions. Population change was no longer statistically
significant, and one-year mobility became very significant. Model six was the only model where
one-year mobility was significant. The variables with the most considerable significant impact
on mobile home percent were housing protection policy, January temperature, January hours of
sun, July temperature, and weighted mobile homes; all of which except the latter also had
substantial effects in previous models.
Discussion
Due to the lack of past literature on determinants of mobile home prevalence, our analysis
was exploratory, and although these results are exploratory, they still provide useful insights into
the nature of county-level variance in mobile home prevalence. In general, higher percentages of
mobile homes were influenced by county population size, which is supported by the literature,
however high population growth leading to higher rates of mobile homes is not present in past
work (George & Barr, 2005). The positive relationship between population change and mobile
homes is may be rooted in that mobile homes and mobile home communities are quickly built
and can respond quickly to needs for additional housing in communities. This relationship could
have an impact in high natural amenity areas, particularly in counties experiencing the dual
migration of both high-income retirees and lower-income workers moving in to take jobs in
construction and hospitality sectors (Hunter, Boardman, & Saint Onge, 2005; Nelson, Lee, &
Nelson, 2008; Nelson & Nelson, 2010). The age makeup of a county, particularly the percentage
of the population deemed elderly, had a surprisingly negative impact on mobile home
percentages. As previously mentioned, many Sunbelt and retirement destination communities
have seen the growth of upscale mobile home communities (Morgan & Hart, 1995; Hart et al.,

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

18

2002). Findings from this analysis run counter to this growth in non-traditional mobile home
communities.
Much of the past literature on mobile homes has focused on the negative impacts mobile
home residence has on their often-impoverished residents. Many measures of poverty and
economic disadvantage are associated with higher percentages of mobile homes (MacTavish,
2007; Aman & Yarnal, 2010). In all models in which they are present, percent of the population
with a bachelor’s degree, percent in near poverty, and percent receiving public assistance have a
significant relationship with the key variable, showing that areas of higher economic distress, or
community well-being, often coincide with places where individuals are more likely to live in
mobile homes. However, this does not indicate on its own that more impoverished people within
these counties are more likely to live in mobile homes than apartments or traditional homes.
Two labor-related variables also had an impactful relationship with mobile home
prevalence. Both higher levels of unemployment and lower levels of labor force participation
were related to higher levels of mobile homes in counties. Our models showed that both the short
term (unemployment rate) and long-term (labor force participation rate) economic conditions of
counties had impacts on the types of housing in a county. It is interesting that places which may
be deemed economically stagnate, with high amounts of people not participating in the labor
market, are places where people often live in this untraditional housing type, which in itself is
often associated with further adverse economic outcomes. Interestingly, being a persistent
poverty county does not have an impact on mobile home density. These results may indicate that
employment and labor-related economic factors play a much more robust role in determining the
prevalence of mobile homes than the persistence of poverty.

As our dependent variable was itself the prevalence of a type of housing, it is
unsurprising that county mobile home percentage is strongly affected by other housing variables.
Many of the financial and social struggles of mobile home ownership are rooted in their lack of
legal protections from speedy evictions and other housing issues (Sullivan, 2017b). While
stronger state-level protections for mobile home residents, in theory, should make things better
for those that live in mobile homes (Sullivan, 2017b), state-level protections did not increase the
prevalence of mobile homes. In fact, our model estimated that state-level protections
significantly decreased mobile home prevalence. We believe there are two possible explanations
for this relationship. First, many states with housing protections are located in the Northeast,
where other factors such as natural amenities and socio-economic characteristics may already
decrease the prevalence of mobile homes. Second, legal protections may deter land developers
from building mobile homes and mobile home communities in these states due to the policies
protecting residents, ultimately making mobile home communities less attractive to developers. It
is possible that since the number of states with strong protections for mobile homeowners is few,
developers elect to build in states with policies more favorable to the developer. In this case,
these state laws appear to have the unintended effect of promoting legal protections at the
expense of affordable housing. This relationship requires further research to determine the cause
of this inverse effect.
The other three housing variables in the models have a statistical relationship with mobile
home percentages in most models. Our model estimates that mobile home prevalence is higher in
areas with lower residential turnover, lower levels of renters, and more affordable housing. While
we cannot make individual inference from our ecological analysis, these findings are in line with
previous research finding that most mobile home residents own their own home

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

20

(Kusenbach, 2017), that mobile homeownership is often stable and long-term (Aman & Yarnal,
2010), and that mobile homeownership is an accessible form of affordable housing (Sullivan,
2017b).
In our analysis, we explored the relationship between industry presence and mobile home
prevalence. While we explored the relationship for both natural resources and manufacturing,
only natural resource industry presence was significant in the final model. Unfortunately, the
ACS does not provide estimates for natural resource industry employment or occupational
employment alone. Due to this, we cannot entirely separate the effect of natural resources from
agriculture in the case of industry, and construction in the case of occupation. That being said,
the relationship between the natural resource industry and mobile homes has a solid grounding in
both the popular press (Sulzberger, 2011) and industry related press (Lyons, 2013). However, to
our knowledge, there has yet to be an empirical link between natural resource industry presence
and mobile home prevalence.
Our final model estimated that a one-percent increase in natural resource and construction
occupation employment corresponds to a .39% increase in mobile home prevalence. The impact
of natural resource and construction occupation employment on mobile home prevalence is the
third strongest relationship in our model. However, employment in the agricultural and natural
resource industries had a significant negative, albeit weak, effect on mobile home prevalence.
These opposite relationships may be reflective of the difference in industry and occupation, as
measured by the U.S. Census Bureau. The percent of people employed in the agriculture and
natural resource industries includes people in all income brackets, from maintenance to
upperlevel management. Given the little information available regarding natural resource
employment and mobile homes, it seems unlikely that all people employed in the industry would

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

21

be likely to live in mobile homes. Rather, it is likely only to be people doing specific lower-level
occupations related to natural resources, which may be more appropriately reflected by the
percent of people employed in natural resource and construction occupations.
Given both the history of natural resource employment in the United States, wherein the
industry sets up quickly and population growth occurs rapidly (Kinchy et al., 2014), and the
frequent occurrence of man camps in areas of high natural resource extraction (Lyons, 2013), the
positive relationship between natural resource and construction occupational employment and
mobile home prevalence is unsurprising. However, although there is an anecdotal knowledge
concerning impacts of natural resource extraction and mobile homes, as well as popular press
(Sulzberger, 2011) and in-depth journalism (Briody, 2017) regarding the phenomenon, published
research linking natural resource industry presence to mobile home prevalence remains absent
from the literature.
Our model suggests that mobile home prevalence is not only tied to natural resource and
construction occupations but has a stronger impact nationwide than all other variables except for
the labor force participation rate and the percent of households near poverty. It should be noted
that it is certainly possible that we are capturing the influence of the presence of those building
the mobile home communities (e.g. construction), but given that mobile homes are generally
built off-site and simply set up on location, we are confident that natural resource industry
presence has an influence on mobile home prevalence that warrants further exploration.
Beyond the natural resource industry, we also explored the effect of natural amenities on
mobile home prevalence. As we would expect, the effect of the natural amenity characteristics on
mobile home prevalence decreased with the addition of a spatial control. However, four amenity
characteristics remained significant in the final model. It appears that year-round temperature,

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A

22

sunlight, and water area have a positive relationship with mobile home prevalence. Although
humidity and topography do not have an effect. It is possible that these relationships are the
result of the difficulties of heating and insulating mobile homes. Additionally, it is likely we are
capturing the influence of the increase in mobile home density previously documented in Sunbelt
and retirement communities (Morgan & Hart, 1995; Hart et al., 2002), which are likely to be in
warm areas regardless of humidity or topography.
Conclusions
Those who live in mobile homes often experience adverse social and economic outcomes
as a result of their residence (MacTavish, 2007; Sullivan, 2017), not due to the direct impact of
the mobile home, but due to the social stigma and regressive housing policies associated with
mobile home communities. This may lead some to advocate for the removal of mobile homes in
many areas. However, as mobile homes are also a significant source of affordable housing,
removal of mobile home communities removes one of the largest sources of affordable housing
in the United States (Sullivan, 2017). The purpose of this analysis on county-level mobile home
prevalence was in many ways an effort to understand what types of communities are most likely
to feel the positive and negative effects of mobile homes. Our analysis found that while the
strongest predictor of mobile home prevalence was the percent of the population near poverty,
other variables play a significant role. Labor force participation, unemployment, and
employment in natural resource industries all play an important role in influencing the
percentage of a county population living in mobile homes. Environmental factors, chiefly
yearround temperatures, are also an influential factor, possibly indicating that the positive
benefits of mobile homes are relatively unobtainable in some places. This analysis is a first step
in developing a large-scale, national understanding of mobile home prevalence in the United

MOBILE HOME PREVALENCE IN THE U.S.A
States. Our findings with hope will lead to more research concerning this often forgotten, but
important,
type of housing.
