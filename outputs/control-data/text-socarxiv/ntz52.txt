The Impacts of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors on Firm Performance:
Panel Study of Malaysian Companies
Abstract
Purpose - The ESG factor, which consists of environmental, social, and governance factors,
represents the non-financial performance of a company. United Nations Principles for
Responsible Investment (UN-PRI) invites investors to consider ESG issues when evaluating
the performance of any company. Moreover, nowadays the contribution of corporations
towards sustainable development is a major concern of investors, creditors, government, and
other environmental agencies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact
of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian public limited companies in terms of
profitability, firm value, and cost of capital.
Design/methodology/approach – A total of 54 companies are selected from Bloomberg’s ESG
database that has complete ESG and financial data from 2010 to 2013. This study conducted
panel data regressions such as the pooled OLS, fixed effect, and random effect.
Findings - Based on the regression results, there is no significant relationship between
individual and combined factors of ESG and firm profitability (i.e., ROE) as well as firm
value (i.e., Tobin’s Q). Moreover, individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant with
the cost of capital (WACC), but the combined score of ESG positively and significantly
influences the cost of capital (WACC) of a company.
Practical implications - As this is a new study on Malaysia, the findings of this study will be
useful to investors, SRI analysts, policy makers, and other related agencies.
Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first empirical
study to examine the impact of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian public limited

companies in terms of profitability, firm value, and cost of capital.

Introduction
Environmental, social, and governance factors, collectively known as ESG factors, is a term
used in the capital markets to refer to a company’s non-financial performance. In 2006, the
United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) and United Nations
Global Compact, investment industry, and intergovernmental and governmental organisations
collaborated to create the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI).
The goals of the UN-PRI are to understand the implications of ESG and to support investors
in integrating these issues in their investment practices (UN-PRI, 2015a). UN-PRI requests
investors to consider ESG issues when evaluating the performance of any company (Caplan,
Griswold, & Jarvis, 2013). Given the quantum of investment funds managed by the UN-PRI
signatories, the public listed companies are compelled to engage in and report their ESG
activities. Responsible investors will consider a company’s performance in the ESG factors in
addition to its financial performance when making investment decisions.
Therefore, investors and stakeholders are concerned about the ESG factors of a
company to know where the company invests money and how the company conducts
business. The environmental concerns of investors and stakeholders, for instance, are natural
environment protection, climate change, and environmental impacts arising from a business
operation. The social factors important to stakeholders are human rights, equality, diversity in
2

the workplace, and contribution to the society. Some of the concerned governance issues are
ownership structure, board independence, equitable treatment of shareholders, minority
shareholders’ rights, transparency, and disclosure of corporate information.
Literature refers to the broad class of investment practice by a variety of names that
integrates the consideration of ESG factors given the considerable acceptance of the UN-PRI
among investors (Eccles & Viviers, 2011). Some of the more familiar ones include: Socially
Responsible Investment (e.g., Abramson & Chung, 2000; Statman, 2008), Ethical Investment
(e.g., Mackenzie & Lewis, 1999; Schwartz, 2003), Social Investment (e.g., Cox, Brammer, &
Millington, 2007; Dunfee, 2003), Responsible Investment (e.g., Dembinsk et al., 2003;
Thamotheram & Wildsmith, 2007; Viviers et al., 2009), and Sustainable Investment (e.g.,
Koellner et al., 2007; Weber, 2005). Aust (2013) opines that although there are some
differences, corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be generally understood as roughly
equivalent to ESG.
There is a growing body of study on ESG, especially based on developed countries.
Therefore, the actual state of ESG practices and ESG impacts on companies from emerging
economies have not been sufficiently explored. This study is an attempt to empirically
investigate the impact of ESG factors on Malaysian companies.
There are strong justifications to conduct the study in Malaysia. Malaysia is an
emerging economy that is targeted to achieve vision 2020 to become a developed nation by
the year 2020. Therefore, the government of Malaysia has been steadily encouraging
companies to exercise good corporate governance and place adequate emphasis on CSR
issues, particularly in efforts to improve the overall quality of life, such as health and safety
protection, pollution, and environmental concerns, in addition to environmental protection.
The government launched SRI funds in 2003 with the objective of investing in profitable
companies that are not involved in objectionable businesses such as alcohol and gambling
while having good corporate credentials, such as good corporate governance and are
environmentally conscious. These pioneer funds have been working together with various
NGOs on ethical issues besides having a special advisory board to advice fund managers on
matters pertaining to social responsibility, environmental protection, and corporate
governance (Securities Commission, 2004).
Moreover, the Malaysian government supports responsible investment initiatives. In the
national budget of 2014, the Government announced that efforts would be stepped up towards
promoting Malaysia as a destination for SRI and an ESG Index would be established by
Bursa Malaysia. On 22nd December 2014, Bursa Malaysia launched the ESG Index known
as FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia (F4GBM) Index in alliance with Financial Times Stock
Exchange (FTSE) as part of the worldwide FTSE4Good Index Series and also aligned with
other leading global ESG frameworks such as the GRI and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
With this new index, investors, shareholders, and clients expect greater responsibility and
transparency from companies and their investments (The Star, 2014). Furthermore, a
government linked investment holding company, Valuecap Sdn. Bhd., was allocated RM one
billion to create an ESG Fund used to buy shares from the Bursa Malaysia ESG Index (The
Star, 2015). Given the above initiatives and the amount of resources allocated by the
government, it is clear that the government intends to encourage the ESG integration in the
investment practices in Malaysia. Therefore, this study on Malaysia will be highly beneficial
for policy makers and related public and private agencies.

Literature Review and Hypotheses Development
ESG and Firm’s Profitability
Studies examining the relationship between CSR/ Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and
Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) are abundant in literature since the 1970s. Aggarwal
(2013) claims that Narver in 1971 conducted the first study covering CSP and CFP
relationship. Griffin and Mahon (1997) reviewed 62 research results from 51 prior articles
that had analysed the relationship between CSR and financial performance. They found that
33 research results supported a positive relationship, 20 of the research supported a negative
relationship, and nine of studies had no definite results.
Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Reynes (2003) in their meta-analysis of 52 empirical studies
concluded that CSP was positively correlated with firm performance and the relationship
tends to be simultaneous and bi-directional. They also found that CSP measures were more
highly correlated with accounting-based indicators of firm performance (such as ROA and
ROE) than with market-based measures (such as share price).
According to Clark, Feiner, and Viehs (2014), there are two common types of ESG
studies that have been published. First, scholars have directly examined individual
dimensions of ESG (e.g., governance), testing for correlations with firm performance. They
claim that 85% of ESG studies only examine one aspect of ESG and not all three aspects at
the same time. Results of the relationships between ESG and financial performance have
been mixed (Wood, 2010; Yegnasubramanian, 2008). The second category of research is
studies that focus on SRI funds. Researchers examine a group of SRI funds with a portfolio
of non-SRI funds to assess results on indicators such as financial performance, market
valuation, or stock returns (e.g., Brammer, Brooks, & Pavelin, 2006; Jones et al., 2008).
Results have also generally been mixed, with various studies finding no significant
differences between SRI and non-SRI funds’ performance (Clark, et al., 2014). This study
concentrates on the impact of ESG factors towards firm performance of Malaysian public
limited companies. Based on the similar premise of previous literature, it is predicted that:
H1a: There is a significant positive relationship between ESG factors and profitability
of Malaysian public limited companies.
ESG and Firm’s Value
In the long run, in addition to good operating performance, non-financial performance such
as environmental and social performance should be translated to a better valuation of listed
firms (Bassen & Kovacs, 2008; Porter & Kramer, 2011; Al-Najjar & Anfimiadou, 2012).
Derwall et al. (2005) studied the share price relationship with the corporate environmental
performance for the period of 1995 to 2003 and found that companies with higher corporate
environmental performance delivered higher returns. Eccles, Ioannou, and Serafeim (2014)
investigated the performances of high-sustainability portfolio and low-sustainability portfolio
and found that in the 18 years period of study, the high-sustainability portfolio delivered
higher returns. Godfrey, Merril, and Hansen (2009) found that high sustainability profile
helped to mitigate any downwards pressure on share price upon the announcements of
negative environmental event. Earlier, Cormier and Magnan (1997) reported that companies
with higher pollution indicators had lower market value. In a similar vein, Hamilton (1995)
argued that toxic releases announcements of a company would lead to significant negative
reactions in the company’s share price.

Many studies have also looked at governance mechanism impact on firms’ value (such
as Tobin’s Q and price-to-book ratio). Good governance has been shown to increase
investors’ confidence which results in enhanced firm value (Bauer, Guenster, & Otten, 2004;
Bebchuk, Cohen, & Ferrell, 2010; Gompers, Ishii, & Metrick, 2003; Lemmon & Lins,2002;
Bebchuk et al., 2010; Siagian, Siregar, & Rahadian, 2013).
In general, the majority of prior studies find positive relationships between
sustainability and firm value. However, some authors find negative relationships between
sustainability measures and stock price performance (e.g., Brammer et al., 2006; FisherVanden & Thorburn, 2011). Following the results of prior researches, the relationship of ESG
factors with firm value in this study is hypothesised as follows:
H1b: There is a significant positive relationship between ESG factors and firm value of
Malaysian public limited companies.
ESG and Firm’s Cost of Capital
A company’s cost of equity is the rate of return on the shares required by investors. Thus, the
cost of equity is the investors’ expected return and reflects the investor’s perception on a
firm’s riskiness of cash flows (Witmer & Zorn, 2007). Meanwhile, the cost of debt is the
effective rate that a firm pays on all its bank loans, bonds, and other forms of debt.
Theoretically, the cost of capital increases when the investors and creditors require a higher
reward for the higher risk taken. Therefore, when the perceived risk decreases, the cost of
capital decreases as well. Investors are becoming more sensitive to ESG issues of an
investment target. Firms with higher risk profiles would generally have cost of debt (interest
rate) and/or higher cost of equity capital (risk premium). On the other hand, a company with
lower company risk profile would normally enjoy a lower cost of capital (Bassen, Meyer, &
Schlange, 2006). Better disclosure of non-financial practices, such as ESG, can reduce a
company’s cost of capital by significantly decreasing the estimation risk in the capital
markets (Easley & O’Hara, 2004) and by reducing information asymmetries and/or
transaction costs (Graham et al., 2005). Additionally, studies investigating the impact of good
sustainability practices on a firm’s cost of debt have showed that firms with better
environmental management systems have significantly lower credit spreads that lead to a
lower cost of debt (Bauer & Hann, 2010). On the other hand, firms with major environmental
issues have to pay significantly higher interest rates on their loans (Goss & Roberts, 2011).
Prior literature has also studied the effects of corporate governance on the cost of debt,
and the findings are relatively positive: good corporate governance correlates with reduced
borrowing costs and smaller credit spreads. It has been reported that certain corporate
governance elements have significant effects on a company’s cost of debt, for instance, the
institutional investor ownership (Bhojraj & Sengupta, 2003; Cremers, Nair, & Wei, 2007),
the ratio of outside directors (Bhojraj & Sengupta, 2003), and the information disclosure
quality (Schauten & van Dijk, 2011). Similarly, Bradley et al. (2008) argue that a more stable
board significantly reduces bond spreads and enhances credit ratings. These findings can be
extended to the current study and it is hypothesised that:
H1c: There is a significant negative relationship between ESG factors and cost of
capital of Malaysian public limited companies.
Methodology

Measurements of Variables
The research framework of this study is built in the stakeholder theory perspective. The
stakeholder theory posits that a company needs to satisfy internal and external stakeholders’
demands. ESG activities are seen as the management’s efforts to pacify the stakeholders’
demands and to gain better firm performance. This study attempts to investigate the effect of
ESG factors towards firm performance in Malaysian public limited companies (PLC).
The use of both accounting-based and market-based measures as indicators of financial
performance has been debated by academics since the 1980s (Gentry & Shen, 2010). To
capture both the historical and potential future performance of the companies, this study will
use both accounting and market measures in the measurements of financial performance.
Therefore, the dependent variable – firm performance – is assessed using three criteria –
profitability, firm value, and cost of capital. These models are modified and are an extension
of prior researches such as Simpson and Kohers (2002), Mishra and Suar (2010), and Jang,
Lee, and Choi (2013).
ROE is selected as the accounting based measurement in this study, as it is one of the
more popular methods to measure financial performance (Griffin & Mahon, 1997), and the
single most important indicator for investors to measure firm’s management performance
(Scott, 2003). It measures net income earned by a firm as a percentage of shareholders
investment. Bloomberg calculates ROE using the following formula:
ROE = Net Income Available for Common Shareholders / Average Total Common
Equity) * 100
In terms of market-based measurements, Tobin’s Q and Weighted Average Cost of
Capital (WACC) are used in this study. Tobin’s Q is the measure of firm value, defined as the
ratio of the market value of a firm over the value of firm’s physical asset (Kim, Chung, &
Park, 2013). It indicates how the market values a company’s existing assets. This means
higher valued companies will have higher Tobin’s Q value compared to lower valued
companies. Bloomberg database calculates Tobin’s Q and WACC using the following
formula:
Tobin’s Q = (Market Capitalisation + Total Liabilities + Preferred Equity +Minority
Interest) /Total Assets
WACC = [ KD x (TD/V) ] + [ KP x (P/V) ] + [ KE x (E/V) ]
where:
KD
= Cost of Debt;
TD
= Total Debt;
V
= Total Debt + Preferred Equity + Equity Capital;
KP
= Cost of Preferred Equity;
P
= Preferred Equity;
KE
= Cost of Equity;
E
= Equity Capital.
The independent variable, the ESG factors, is measured using the ESG ratings
published in the Bloomberg database. The Bloomberg database rates the ESG disclosure
score using four disclosure scores that summarise a company’s level of disclosure on
environmental, social, and governance disclosure scores, and an overall ESG disclosure
6

score. All the disclosure scores are normalised to the range of 0.1 (for companies that
disclose the minimum amount of data) to 100 (for companies that disclose every data point
collected by Bloomberg). All data is weighted in terms of importance and higher weights are
given to more relevant disclosures (Giannarakis, 2013).
Two common control variables in the literature, i.e., Leverage and Size of the company,
are utilised in this study. Leverage is the funding sourced by a company from third parties to
operate its business. It is measured by the ratio of total liabilities to total equity capital.
Leverage is included in this study because managers typically disclose more ESG information
as leverage increases as a result of additional scrutiny from financial institutions (Lanis &
Richardson, 2013) and to lower a firm’s cost of capital (Francis, Nanda, & Olssson, 2008;
Healy & Palepu, 2001). Leverage of the past also represents an enterprise risk that could
affect the financial performance in the future (Prior, Surroca, & Tribo, 2008).
Lastly, size is included as a control variable because previous studies showed that size
has a positive relationship with CSR disclosure (Cho, Roberts, & Patten, 2010; Clarkson, Li,
Richardson, & Vasvari, 2008). Size of a company in this study is measured by the total
assets.
Estimation of Models
To estimate the hypotheses, this study relies on panel regression. The regression models used
in this study are adopted and modified based on prior studies by Jang et al. (2013) and Saleh
et al. (2011). There are six models to check the hypotheses – models 1.1 and 1.2 test
hypotheses H1a; models 2.1 and 2.2 test H1b; and models 3.1 and 3.2 test H1c. The model
of the study is shown in the following:
L_ROEit = β0 + β1 L_ESGit-1 + β2L_SIZEit + β3L_LEVit + ε
L_ROEit = β0 + β1 L_Eit-1 + β2 L_Sit-1 + β3 L_Git-1 + β4L_SIZEit+ β5L_LEVit+ ε
L_TQit = β0 + β1 L_ESGit-1 + β2 L_SIZEit + β3 L_LEVit + ε
L_TQit = β0 + β1 L_Eit-1 + β2 L_Sit-1 + β3 L_Git-1 + β4 SIZEit + β5 LEVit + ε
L_WACCit = β0 + β1 L_ESGit-1 + β2 SIZEit + β3 LEVit + ε

This study applies the three static panel approaches such as pooled OLS, fixed effects,
and random effects models. The pooled OLS is a highly restrictive model, as it imposes a
common intercept and slope coefficients for all cross-sections, and thus, disregards individual
heterogeneity. The fixed effects model, on the other hand, assumes that the estimator has
7

common slopes and variance but with company-specific intercepts. Both the cross-sectional
and time effects can be observed through the introduction of dummy variables, especially in
the two-way fixed effects models. This estimator has common slopes and variance and
individual-specific intercepts. The rationale behind using this estimator is to control for all
possible unobserved characteristics of each company in the study. In contrast to the fixed
effects model, the random effects model is relatively less problematic in terms of degrees of
freedom by assuming common intercepts. Moreover, we applied the random effect where the
variation across a company is assumed to be random and uncorrelated with the explanatory
variables included in the model. Nevertheless, the random effects model has another
limitation in that it considers the model to be time invariant. This implies that the error at any
period is uncorrelated with the past, present, and future, known as strict exogeneity (Arellano,
2003). In real life, this assumption is very often invalid. Next, a Hausman test is used to
compare two estimators where one, the more efficient, is consistent only under H0 and the
other is inefficient under H1.
Sources of Data
ESG and firm performance data are collected from the Bloomberg database because currently
it has relatively more Malaysian companies listed in its database compared to GRI, KLD, and
the newly established Bursa Malaysia FTSE4Good Index databases. Bloomberg reports
detailed ESG data (e.g., board composition, board independence, employee turnover
percentage, and biodiversity policy) and the ESG data is updated on a yearly basis. The use of
ESG and sustainability ratings are synonymous with the mainstream investment trends
surrounding ESG integration practices currently being observed in financial markets (Xiao et
al., 2013), as well as a credible source of information that benefits researchers in terms of
savings in time and cost (Sekaran & Bougie, 2009; Waddock & Graves, 1997).
Bloomberg was launched in 2007 with 36 companies listed in the database. As at
March 2015, there were 74 companies listed in Bloomberg ESG database for Malaysia, but
only 54 companies have complete historical ESG data from the year 2010. This study’s
sample is finalised with the 54 companies given their complete ESG and financial data from
2010 to 2013 (most currently available data).
Consistent with other studies (Saleh et al., 2011), to understand the impacts of ESG
factors on a firm’s future performance, this study uses one period lag of ESG. Therefore, the
data used in the estimation of the model are from 2010 to 2012 for ESG and for other
variables from 2011 to 2013. All of the data are in the e-based logarithmic (ln) form.
Result and Discussion
This study conducted the Hausman test to identify the best estimator among three. The
Hausman test confirms that the fixed effect (FE) estimator is the most efficient compared to
the pooled OLS (POLS) and random effect (RE) for all the hypotheses. Thus, the study
focuses on the FE estimators to explain the results.
The Impact of ESG Factors on Profitability of Firm
Table 1 shows that both the individual and combined scores of ESG are statistically
insignificant in influencing the ROE. The finding shows that companies with ESG
information do not perform any better than those with less ESG information. Meanwhile,
leverage positively and significantly fosters ROE, and asset is negatively and significantly
associated with ROE. The results imply that companies with higher leverage will record
8

higher profitability, and companies of a smaller size are predicted to be more profitable.
Similar results on the impact of ESG on performance were also found in previous literature
such as Crisóstomo et al. (2011); Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield (1985), and Ingram and
Frazier (1980).

The Impact of ESG Factors on Value of Firm
Table 2 shows that both the individual and combined scores of ESG are statistically
insignificant in influencing the Tobin’s Q. Similar results were found by Servaes and Tomayo
(2013) and Haryono and Iskandar (2015). Meanwhile, leverage positively and significantly
fosters Tobin’s Q; and asset is negatively and significantly associated with Tobin’s Q. These
results imply that a smaller company is valued higher than a bigger company by the market,
and a company with higher leverage will gain higher firm value. A smaller company is more
valued by the market because the market anticipates that the company has the potential to be
more valuable in the future. Similarly, a company that has a high leverage ratio is seen as
more valuable with higher profitability.

The Impact of ESG Factors on Cost of Capital
Table 3 shows that the combined scores of ESG positively and significantly influence the
WACC, but individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant in influencing the WACC.
This finding is similar to the result of Ming, Zhi, and Hua (2013) who found that CSR
practices in Asian firms generally could not reduce their cost of capital. Leverage positively
and insignificantly influences the WACC, but asset is associated with WACC negatively and
significantly. This means that a firm with a high ESG score will incur a higher cost of capital.
On the other hand, the cost of capital is low for a large company and vice versa.

Conclusions
This study seeks to investigate whether there is a relationship between a company’s ESG
factors and firm performance, measured using three criteria, i.e., profitability, firm value, and
cost of capital in the case of Malaysia. The results empirically show that there is no
significant relationship between individual and combined factors of ESG and firm
profitability (i.e., ROE) as well as firm value (i.e., Tobin’s Q). The insignificant relationship
implies that companies with more or less ESG information perform equally as well as poorly.
In addition, ESG is also not perceived as increasing firm value; in other words, they are
similarly valued in the market.
However, the combined score of ESG positively and significantly influences the cost
of capital (WACC) of a company, but individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant
in influencing the WACC. This could be attributed to the fact that the stakeholders are yet to
have more confidence in the corporations’ ESG initiatives that could eventually lower their
cost of capital, as in the more developed countries as found by Ming, Zhi, and Hua (2013). In
addition, ESG data may not be used extensively by the capital market in determining the cost
of capital and another reason provided by Jang et al. (2013) on the positive relationship
between ESG and WACC is that the measurement of cost of capital may be subject to errors.
Another possible explanation for the above results is that a short period of study of 3
years may not yield significant statistical results compared to prior literatures that used longer
periods of study. For example, Eccles et al. (2014) argued that the relationship of
sustainability and financial performance is only significant in the long term and not in the
short term. Moreover, Malaysian public companies have been just recently listed in the
Bloomberg ESG database, and many more companies have still yet to be listed in the
FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index to be known to the market of responsible investors or SRI
analysts.
Studies on ESG impacts on companies in emerging economies including Malaysia have
not been sufficiently explored; this study provides empirical evidence that could be useful to
the capital market as well as to the policy makers in their effort to promote responsible
investment in Malaysian public companies in line with the UN-PRI policy. To support this,
companies should be compelled to engage and to report their ESG initiatives.
