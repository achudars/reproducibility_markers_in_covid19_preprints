"13" "ABSTRACT"
"14" "Record numbers of inmates are being released to the community for supervision each year. This poses a challenge to the agencies and officers in charge of providing supervision—there are far more offenders in need of supervision than officers can reasonably attend to. This has  forced  agencies to  be  innovative  in how they  allocate their resources.  Empirical evidence suggests resources should be allocated to high-risk offenders , b ut how can  officers   determine which offender is at a higher risk of misconduct at any given time?  Traditionally, this has been achieved by relying on standardized risk assessment. But risk assessment has been criticized for making only marginally better-than-chance predictions of future misconduct.  We offer a novel solution by integrating the  Elo - rating   system  into  the  community supervision decision -making process .  We show, by drawing on test  data from the Pathways to Desistance Study , that combining the Elo-rating  system  with traditional risk assessment may lead to increases in predictive power . We  then   discuss  how  Elo-rating systems   could be used by   community supervision agencies   to  more effectively prioritize their caseloads."
"15" "THE CHALLENGE"
"16" "Nearly five  million adults  are   under community supervision in the United States   ( Kaeble ,  Maruschak , &  Bonczar , 2015 ;  Kaeble , 2018 ) , with more than half a million offenders released to the community every year ( Lipsey & Cullen, 2007 ).  In 2014, a mong   those  on   probation (≈ 3.9 million) ,  more than half were convicted of felony charges, and of those under parole supervision (≈8 5 0,000), more than half were convicted of violent and property offenses  ( Kaeble ,  Maruschak , &  Bonczar , 2015) .  S upervising offenders in the community is , th erefore ,  a matter of public safety  that requires effective and efficient monitoring  ( Latessa  & Holsinger, 1998 ) .  But with such large numbers of offenders in need of  attention ,  supervision officers face  many barriers  to achieving desired outcomes ."
"17" "There is a growing body of r esearch  on  how to e ffectively monitor  and deliver treatment services to  offenders in the community (see, generally,  Dowden & Andrews, 1999 ;  Gendreau , French, &  Gionet , 2004 ;  Latessa  &  Lowenkamp , 2005;  MacKenzie , 2000 ) .  One aspect of supervision has been identified as key:  supervision  officers  must maintain   contact with the ir  clients.  Yet,  officers’ caseload  size  is well beyond optimal , meaning  officers often are faced with the reality that they must prioritize certain cases to receive intensive supervision, while other cases are assigned to less intensive oversight  ( DeMichele , 2007)."
"18" "S tandardized risk assessments have been developed to   facilitate such prioritization  based on  offenders’  probability of future offending  ( Latessa   &  Lovins , 2010 ) .  These risk assessments include individual-level information that signal which clients  are at risk of recidivism and, hence,  need   the most  attention .   R isk assessment has been validated as a useful tool across many jurisdictions and across many different  types  of offenders ( see, for example,  Latessa  &  Lovins , 2010 ;  Bonta , 2002 ).   It can be  used to  categorize offenders based on  their   risk-level ,  allowing  supervisi ng  officers to organize their caseload by identifying  the different supervision needs of each client  ( Bonta , Wallace- Capretta , & Rooney, 2000)."
"19" "S tandardized risk assessments , however,   come with some  notable  shortcoming s .   S ome of  these shortcomings  will be addressed in the present study .  For example, critics have point ed   out that  risk assessments may  contribute to  racial dispari ties  in sentencing and correctio nal outcomes   (e.g., Bridges & Steen, 1998; Harcourt, 2015) .  Because risk assessments are based on individual-level information, some of the items  included in these assessment tools —such as employment and neighborhood factors— may be  stratified by race and, therefore, risk assessment scores may indirectly correlate with  race.  Although the technique we develop below does not directly address this concern, it does afford opportunities for making adjustments when racial disparities arise —a point to which we will return ."
"20" "A nother   primary  limitation   concerns the use of risk assessment to prioritize officer caseload. Officers typically have large caseloads—far more clients than they can actually visit. Even when officers prioritize  their cases  based on risk assessment (e.g., only visit with high-risk offenders), there are often more clients than there is time. Officers, thus, face an optimization challenge and that challenge is currently being addressed with methods  that need improvement ."
"21" "To illustrate  our points, let us  consider  a hypothetical   officer with  a caseload of  50   clients . The officer administers a risk assessment to all 50 clients and then determines, based on the risk assessment score s , who needs the most intensive levels of supervision. The officer’s decisions will be based on whether each client’s score passes a threshold ,  T . Thus,  high-risk offenders —those who receive intensive supervision—are those who score a value of  T  or higher and  low/moderate -risk  offenders  are those who score lower than  T .  This strategy for prioritization suffers from several obvious optimization challenges. For example, are clients who  score  T -1 really all that different from those who score  T ?  Also, what about the element of time —w hat  happens  if a low-risk client of yesterday  (i.e., someone who scored below  T )  actually recidivates today?  Should that impact the officer’s assessment of others who had scored similarly to that client?  Should   the officer  update  his/her  caseload to  adjust for this new information  on a daily basis ?   We  believe this type of  dynamic  and comparative  information is valuable and should be incorporated into officer decision-making  (see, generally,  Gendreau , French, &  Gionet , 2004 ) .  How to do that, though, is not obvious with traditional risk assessment."
"22" "I f we approach risk assessment in a way that allows officers to capitalize on  the  relative  or  comparative  risk  that each  client   poses , then answers to these questions begin to emerge .  In other words, if clients were systematically and dynamically (meaning, over time) compared to one another  on a case-by-case basis , we believe risk assessment and supervision decisions could be improved. T he purpose of th is  paper is  thus  to introduce a  novel  approach   to risk assessment   that  can carry out such comparisons.  To do so, we will draw on the Elo-rating system—an algorithm that has been applied in a variety of contexts over the past 50 years.  Our approach  starts with the  traditional  risk assessment value as its baseline.  The  additional information that is garnered by the Elo-rating system  is then  considered supplemental to the baseline risk assessment. Thus,  the  Elo-rating  system   is not a replacement for risk assessment ; instead,  it should be thought of as a way to make risk assessment more dynamic and flexible."
"23" "In the paragraphs that follow, we  will offer a brief history and overview of the  Elo - ra t ing   system . We will then develop a novel method for integrating the Elo - rating  system   into decisions about how to prioritize community supervision caseloads. Finally, we will demonstrate how our method could be used by criminal justice practitioners to dynamically and efficiently make supervision decisions ."
"24" "A POTENTIAL SOLUTION: THE ELO - RATING SYSTEM"
"25" "Elo - rating   w as developed  in   the  1950s  by  a  Hungarian physicist and chess player Arpad Elo   (Elo, 1978)  with the goal of making  predictions about the outcomes of  professional  chess matches. The idea   was to develop  a system  that evaluates players in a one-by-one comparison and  thereby  can make  predictions about which player  is   likely to win  any given   match.  B ecause it  is   impossible  for   any given  player  to compete  against all other players ,  each  player ’s  “rank” at any given point in time  is  unkown .  But  Elo  saw a potential solution  and he  develop ed   a system  that  dr e w on   relative  information of the players  so  they could  be  rank ed even  when  most players have never played against one another .  T o  do so, he  develop ed  a standardized score that conveyed information about any given player’s relative abilities.  Over time, these scores  are  updated based on actual performance —scores and relative position improves after  the result of  every  match ."
"26" "For example, suppose player A has a   score of 100 and is competing  against  player B, whose score is 110. Elo ’s system  would  predict , prior to the match,   that player B  will  defeat player A. However, should player A and B actually compete, these scores would be updated  based on the observed outcome .  S uppose   player A defeats player B  (i.e., an upset occurs). P layer A’s  updated   score would increase (above 100) and  player B ’s would decrease .  Their  relative  ranking is also likely to change, where player A is now considered to be higher ranked than player B."
"27" "Elo - ra t ing  systems have been introduced into many different arenas,  ranging  from  dating applications  and  online video games  to  popular fantasy sports . O wing to its power of one-by-one comparison and  its ability to improve prediction accuracy over time (i.e., the longer the  algorithm runs, the better it is at making predictions), the Elo - rating system is now considered a viable optimization tool   across many sectors  (see, generally,  Hvattum  &  Arntzen , 2010).   We think  it can be used to optimize community supervision caseloads."
"28" "USING  ELO -RATING S  TO  OPTIMIZE  COMMUNITY SUPERVISION"
"29" "DECISION -MAKING"
"30" "We propose  to  apply the  Elo - rating   system   to  community   supervision  settings.  By applying  this   strategy, we can predict  which offenders are  more likely to recidivate (re-offend) in a one-by-one comparison and let Elo - r ating   system   update the scores based on whether a particular offender actually re-offends in a follow-up period.  Notice how this approach addresses  a  key  shortcoming  outlined above by capitalizing on the  relative  information that is available  in an  officer’s caseload."
"31" "To explain  further ,   imagine three parolees —{ person  A,  person  B,  person  C}—are on the same caseload. How should we rank them   in terms of recidivism risk  and, therefore, their supervision needs ? Perhaps we compare A to B   based on a risk assessment . That comparison indicates  A is more   likely to recidivate. Then,  suppose  we compare B to  C  and we determine B is more likely   to recidivate. The transitive property then tells us that A  should be higher priority than  C, even though A and C were   never  directly compared . Now imagine the system is much larger than 3 ;  say it  is  300.   It is unreasonable to work through all the possible  combinations  because   there are:"
"32" "W e avoid the need to  conduct   40,000  combinations  if we  randomly draw cases to  compare  and then keep track of  who does and does not recidivate . If we translate  that information  into a standardized value, we could  then  compare the risk of recidivism between any two arbitrarily drawn cases at any time."
"33" "This is the process outlined by the Elo - rating system,  which comes together in a few   steps:"
"34" "1.  E ach case must have an initial value  of risk  drawn, for example from a risk assessment. This value is  symbolized as   Φ A   for  person  A  and  Φ B   for person B ."
"35" "2.  C ompute a rating  R  for  person  A  using:  R A  = 10   ΦA /400 . D o the same for   person   B ."
"36" "3.  C ompute an expected probability of  recidivism   for  person  A  using:  E A  =  ."
"37" "D o the same   for  person  B ."
"38" "4.  Compare   person  A and   person  B ."
"39" "5.  A ssign :"
"40" "S  = +1  when the focal  person  recidivates but his/her  comparison  does not ,"
"41" "S  =  0.5  when both recidivate  or neither recidivate , and"
"42" "S  =  0  when  the focal  person  does not  recidivate  but his/her  comparison  does"
"43" "6.  C ompute updated  ratings   for  person  A ( Φ ′ A ) and   person  B ( Φ ′ B ) using :"
"44" "Φ ′ A  =  R A  +  K  × ( S A  −  E A )"
"45" "Φ ′ B  =  R B  +  K  × ( S B  −  E B ) ,"
"46" "where  K  is a measure of how strong the  comparison  is between the two  people ,  R A  is the rating calculated above,  S A  is the value being assigned to person   A for a  recidivism  from above, and  E ’ A  is the expected score for person A prior to the   competition.   The sum of  E ’ A  and  E ’ B   is always  1."
"47" "A fundamental question is  what value should be used for  K ?  If  K  is too  large,  the  rankings will tend to diﬀer  widely  before and after any given   comparison . Values that are too low will not allow  for much change in  the rankings.  K  = 32  is  common and will be used  herein, but  note that  the values of  K  could be adjusted, depending on variation  in  clients ’ risk level  within a caseload.  This is a useful  property , because  it allows the officer to readily adjust  the  starting point for  ranking based on  information  that may be outside of the algorithm and, otherwise, would be hard to quantify .  In other words, the  K -factor  allows  the supervision officer to account for information that might not otherwise be picked up by the risk assessment or the Elo -rating system.   This provides  an opportunity for  officers  to  adjust rankings based on concerns , such as racial biases,  with risk assessment."
"48" "Using the  strategy  outlined above, we believe it is possible  to rank oﬀenders in terms of their recidivism risk in real-time , which  could  then  be updated using a dynamic process where values are constantly computed   based on  a continuously run comparison  or based on new information that comes in over the course   of the parole/probation period. For instance, we could extend the  ratings   to include external information such as a report that person A has absconded, that person   B was hanging out with known criminals, or that person  C  had left an area that s/he was   not supposed to (e.g., through an alert from electronic monitoring or self-reports)."
"49" "A DEMONSTRATION"
"50" "To demonstrate that the Elo- rating  system   could be effectively applied to officers’ caseload s , we apply this strategy to  a sample of juvenile offenders   from the Pathways to Desistance Study .  Recall that the Elo-rating  system   requires  an  initial value  Φ   prior to having the subjects compete  each other . Those values could be drawn from various sources, but in a community supervision setting, it would be helpful to use scores from risk assessment to generate  Φ . Thus,  we  generate values  for  Φ  using  a  bespoke measure of  risk assessment  that  could be constructed with the Pathways data .   These   risk assessment  scores  serve two purposes. The first   is to generate the initial value  Φ   for each offender . This will fulfill  Step 1   of the Elo-rating  system   that was explained earlier. We then follow all the steps  outlined above  to create Elo scores for each offender .  The second purpose is  to demonstrate that the Elo-rating  system   may  prove useful in a correctional setting above and beyond risk assessments.  To do so ,  we introduce the Elo  score s , as well as the risk assessment score s , as independent predictors of recidivism  using multivariate regression modelin g ."
"51" "METHODS"
"52" "Data"
"53" "The  Pathway s  to Desistance  Study  (Mulvey, 2016)   is   a multi-site study that followed  N = 1 ,354 serious juvenile offenders from adolescen ce  to young adulthood between the years 2000 and 2010.  The sample included youths who were between the age s  of 14 and 18 at the time of their first offense and were found guilty of serious offenses. The main purpose of the study was to explore juvenile offenders’ patterns of desistance f rom  antisocial behavior, and to understand the factors that may contribute to positive changes in a youth’s life  over time .   Adjudicated youth in the sample were from Maricopa County in Arizona ( N =654) and Philadelphia  C ounty  in Pennsylvania ( N =700).  The baseline interview s  with these youths we r e conducted from November 2000 to January 2003, followed by 10 follow-up interviews . The follow-up interviews were conducted in a 6-month window for the first three years, and then in a one-year window afterwards  (Mulvey, 2016) ."
"54" "Measures"
"55" "R ecidivism .   W e  created a  self-reported measure of recidivism  at  the first follow-up   and the second follow-up.  The recidivism measure at the first follow-up will be  entered into  the Elo -rating   system .  The  recidivism  measure  at the second follow-up  will be used as  the outcome of interest  in our analysis .  At both waves, t his variable was created based on self-reported offending across 22 different types of criminal or antisocial acts.  B ecause we  were  interested in binary outcomes (i.e. ,   recidivism or not ), we recoded this variable so that those who reported no criminal act since the first follow-up  were coded  0 and  those with one or more reported  criminal acts  were  coded 1.  M ore  than half  of the  respon dents  (5 8. 5 %)  reported  at least one  criminal  act  during the first follow-up period and  a similar percentage (5 0 . 5 % )  reported at least one criminal act in the second follow-up .  Table  1 presents the descriptive statistics for variables included in our analysis."
"56" "***I nsert Table 1 about  H ere ***"
"57" "R isk assessment .  W e used the baseline data to create a  bespoke measure of  risk assessment. We selected five variables that empirical evidence suggests are important in predicting recidivism  and that are typically included in standardized risk assessment instruments  (Andrews &  Bonta , 2010) : impulse control, criminal history, peer pressure,  substance dependency , and   gender."
"58" "Impulse control   was included because prior literature has shown it to be a robust predictor of antisocial behavior  (Gottfredson  &  Hirschi, 1990; Pratt  &  Cullen, 2000) .  This measure includes 8 items from the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory, and each item ranges from 1 (= false) to 5 (= true). Higher scores indicate more impulse control   (Mulvey, 2016) ."
"59" "Criminal history   was constructed by calculating the proportion  of the  22   self-reported  criminal activities  at the baseline interview  that each participant reported involvement in ."
"60" "Resistance to peer pressure  was included because it represents a protective factor for  criminal behavior  ( Akers, 2017;  Miller, 2010) .  Scores  were  based on 10 scenarios  for  which the participants rated the degree to which they are influenced by their peers .   T he smallest value is 1, which indicates   it is really true I am influenced by my peers . The highest value is 4,  which denotes   it’s really true I prefer to be an individual .  Respondents  were  also presented with two conflicting scenarios  and were instructed to  take  a side as if they were in that  situation  and  would act similar to the selected scenario  (Mulvey, 2016) .  When combined,  higher score s  indicate more resistance to peer pressure."
"61" "Substance dependency   consisted of multiple   items  that  tap  into alcohol and drug dependency  over the past  six  months.  These items  were  then summed to  account for substance  dependency symptoms. Because the majority of participants reported no substance dependency over the past six months (6 7 . 9 %), we  created a binary variable where  0 indicates no substance dependency and 1 indicates  some form of  substance dependency."
"62" "Finally,   g ender   was coded 0 for males and 1 for females . Approximately 86% of the sample  was  male."
"63" "We performed an exploratory  factor analysis  and found that all five items loaded onto a single latent construct with  an Eigenvalue of 0.964 (the next factor had an Eigenvalue of 0.157).  We used regression scoring to produce values for the risk assessment measure and, as shown in Figure 1, those  scores were normally distributed."
"64" "***Insert Figure 1 about Here***"
"65" "Analysis Plan"
"66" "The analysis unfolded in two steps. First, we generated Elo values for all participants in  the Pathways data .  This involved a series of computation steps that translated the Elo -rating   system  that was describe d  above into a form that could be applied to the Pathways data. Second, we use d  the risk assessment measure and the Elo   scores  to predict recidivism   at the second follow-up  independently and in combination with one another. These  relationships  were  estimated  by logistic regression."
"67" "RESULTS"
"68" "Creating Elo  Scores for Pathways Participants"
"69" "The first step to the analysis was to create the Elo score for each of the participants in the Pathways Study. To do so, we followed the six-step process  to the Elo-rating system  that was outlined above.  First, we generated values of  Φ  for every participant.  Values on our measure of  risk assessment  were used for  Φ ."
"70" "The  second  step was to generate the  R  score for each participant. This was carried out by computing the formula noted above (i.e.,  R  = 10   Φ /400 )."
"71" "Third, we computed expected probabilities of recidivism  using:  E  =  ."
"72" "Fourth, we set up “competitions” between randomly drawn cases. The “competition” was defined simply by observing which of the two participants recidivated at the first follow-up."
"73" "Step five involved coding “wins” (i.e., recidivism) and “los s es” (no recidivism). If the focal participant recidivated but his/her competitor did not, then the focal participant was coded  S  = +1  and his opponents  S  = 0 .   If both recidivated or if neither recidivated, then both participants were coded  S  = 0.5 for a draw ."
"74" "Finally, the sixth step was to c ompute updated  Elo scores  ( Φ′ ) by carrying out the following computations for both participants A and B :"
"75" "Φ′ A  =  R A  +  K  × ( S A  −  E A )"
"76" "Φ′ B  =  R B  +  K  × ( S B  −  E B )"
"77" "In keeping with prior work, we set  K  = 32."
"78" "Carrying out this process meant that we had a new predictor —the Elo score— that could be used   in addition to the risk assessment   to predict recidivism at the second follow-up period. The Elo scores were uniformly distributed  (see Figure  2 ) , so they  could also  be used to rank offenders in terms of their expected risk of recidivism ."
"79" "***Insert Figure  2  about Here***"
"80" "Does Elo   Score  Predict Recidivism   vis-à-vis  Risk Assessment Score ?"
"81" "Table 2 presents the result s  of th ree  logistic regression  models, each  predicting recidivism at the second follow-up .  In the first model, risk assessment is used to predict recidivism. T he  estimated  coefficient  for the risk assessment measure was  0.958  and was  statistically significant  ( P <0.01). To contextualize this result, we computed the positive predictive value (PPV), which is a percentage score that  indicates  how many of those cases that were predicted to recidivate actually did so. For model 1, the PPV was  64.33% , which suggests the risk assessment measure is a  weak -to-moderate predictor of recidivism .  We also computed the area under the ROC curve, which converged on an estimate of 0.688 . This  is  right in line with the best-available  risk assessment  in terms of  prediction accuracy ( Latessa  &  Lovins , 2010 ) , providing confidence that our results will translate to a real-world setting."
"82" "Model 2   presents  the  Elo   score s   as  unique   predictor of recidivism .  The estimated coefficient for the Elo-rating measure to predict  offending at the second follow-up  was 0.002 and was statistically significant ( P <0.01) .  The PPV score suggests that 60.75% of offender s  that  the  Elo-rating  system  expected to recidivate  at the second follow-up  did in fact  display recidivism .  W e  also  calculated the ROC  for this model, which was slightly smaller than what was observed in Model 1 (ROC = 0.6350)."
"83" "***I nsert Table 2 about  H ere ***"
"84" "Recall that   the   primary  aim  of this study was to demonstrate that  the  Elo-rating  system   may improve  predictions of recidivism  above and beyond risk assessment s . Thus,  the  risk assessment   and Elo-rating  measures   were  both included in Model 3  to assess this possibility .  The estimated coefficient for the risk assessment  and Elo-rating  measures  were  0.979 and  0.002, respectively, and they both remained statistically significant ( P <0.01). The PPV of 66.73% suggests that  by  including both  predictors ,  Model 3  improves  recidivism  prediction  compared to  both  Model 1  and  Model   2 .  The ROC curve converged on an estimate of 0.7299, suggesting a higher accuracy compared to when the risk assessment or Elo-rating measures were used  alone .  This lends support to our argument that the Elo-rating system offers an opportunity for community supervision agencies to optimize their resources by gleaning more accurate estimates of future recidivism risk."
"85" "DISCUSSION"
"86" "Over the past three decades ,  risk assessments have gain ed  popularity  as a tool for  predicting  offender  recidivism. One  of the key  advantage s is that  risk assessment  is a superior method compared to  professional judgment s,  intuiti on ,  or gut feeling  ( Cullen, Myer, &  Latessa , 2009).   Another  advantage afforded by risk assessment  is  prediction validity . B ecause they  introduce  a more systematic  way  of  allocating  resource s  based on offenders’ probability of future  offending , risk assessments have become the preferred tool in many jurisdiction s  ( Latessa   &  Lovins , 2010 ;  Bonta , 2002 ) ."
"87" "T here are , however,  certain limitations   associated with  risk assessments.   For example, r isk assessments  categorize offenders based on their risk level  (typically, low or high risk), which overlooks much of the variation in actual risk levels, leaving a high  degree of  uncertainty  about any given offender’s actual risk level.   Moreover, risk assessments  can  unintentionally contribute to widening racial disparit ies  because the individual-level information included in risk assessments  are often stratified  across  racial and ethnic  groups  ( see, generally,  Bridges & Steen, 1998; Harcourt, 2015) .  Furthermore, risk assessments are incapable of distinguishing offenders that pose a similar risk of recidivism  in a caseload .  This means that r isk assessments are  not useful   for  prioritizing caseloads that include mostly high-risk or low-risk offenders  ( Craig  et al., 2004) , because they leave on e  important  piece of  information untapped :  the  relative or comparative risk  that each  client  poses  compared to others."
"88" "In the present study, we propose d  a new strategy that  can   minimize  these limitations  by incorporating a technique used to garner relative rankings in other industries such as professional sports . We  began by explaining the Elo-rating  system   and how it might be useful in correctional settings. We then  demonstrated that Elo  scores are  capable of  generating  relative   risk  information by allowing one-by-one comparison s , thereby  identifying  the  cases  that pose the highest risk  of recidivism  at any given time.  Because  the Elo-rating  system  relies on relative information—as opposed to individual-level information—it has the potential to minimize  some of  the  above-noted  concerns  with  risk assessment."
"89" "Results from our analysis  supported  the se arguments. Specifically, we found  that  including the Elo-rating  s ystem  as a predictor of later recidivism  improve d  prediction  compared to  a model that included  risk assessment   alone ."
"90" "Utilizing  the  Elo-rating  system  could , therefore,  contribute to methodological improvements  and optimization of supervision resources if it were implemented in a  community  correction setting .  Importantly , Elo  scores   are expected to  improve  as predictors of recidivism  as more data are introduced to the algorithm  over time .  The more we allow cases to compete  (i.e. ,  to be compared against each other) , the more accurate the  Elo  scores  become. This  represents  an advantage over  modern  risk   assessment , in which  offenders’ risk level needs to be  updated  periodically ( Gendreau , French, &  Gionet , 2004) . The Elo-rating  system  would provide updated scores in an on-going basis without the need to subject offenders to risk assessment on a recurring basis ."
"91" "Given the advantages  offered by the Elo-rating  system , w e  now turn to the possibility that  it  could be developed  in to a user-friendly application. Figure  3  reveals how this could work in practice. Suppose a probation officer is assigned to supervise the offenders included in the Pathways to Desistance data. Due to a large caseload, which is the problem  faced by  most  supervision  officers, these cases need to be prioritized. If the probation officer were to use the Elo-rating   system  to supervise the top 10% that pose the highest risk of recidivism, more than 60% of the identified cases would have actually recidivated.  Note that there is a monotonic decrease in the observed proportion of recidivism as Elo scores decrease. This is the practical utility offered by the Elo-rating   system : it provides information that is easily integrated into decision-making schemas."
"92" "***Insert Figure  3  about Here***"
"93" "We intended this study to act as a proof of concept  to demonstrate  that the principles of Elo -rating   system   can  prove useful in a  community supervision  setting.  To do so, we  used test data from the Pathways to Desistance Study and  created  a bespoke measure of risk assessment  to  assess the predictability of the Elo-rating   system   beyond  a typical  risk assessment  instrument . This means that  it remains to be seen how  the  Elo -rating   system   would perform alongside a standardized and validate d   risk assessment  instrument  in an actual community correction setting .  Thus, future studies might fruitfully extend this line of inquiry by applying the Elo-rating  system   to   community supervision  caseload data ."
"94" "One important note is that we used  recidivism   as  a  criterion for updating the  Elo  scores at any given time. This strategy was merely used for the purpose of demonstration. In  practice , if individuals under supervision recidivate, it is likely that they are removed from the community and  are placed in institutions.  For our demonstration, we let t he Elo  scores   “update” based on self-reported offending. That  would not be viable  in a  community correction  setting because no one will admit offending to their  supervising officer .  Thus,   the approach used here  will need to be adjusted if it is  intended for use in the field . That means  the next step in developing this tool will be to  demonstrate that our theoretical example will actually work as intended when applied in real-world settings.   S upervision agencies  c ould use criteria  other than self-reported recidivism  such as  fail ed  drug tests and miss ed   supervision  appointments."
"95" "CONCLUSION"
"96" "The use of risk assessment s  in correctional setting s  has been a topic of  develop ment  but also  controversy.  On the one  hand, standardized risk assessments are more accurate tha n  professional judgements and help supervision officers prioritize their case loads  based on offenders ’  risk levels .  On the other hand,  among other limitations  discussed earlier ,  risk assessments  leave one important  piece of  information untapped—the relative risk that each offender pose s  compared to others  at any given time .  In this paper, we introduced an innovative  strategy to  integrate  that sort of relative  information into risk assessment .  W e  found evidence to support the idea  that  integrating  the Elo-rating  system   with standardized risk assessments  led to improvements in  prediction accuracy  for  recidivism .  A lthough it remains to be seen how the Elo-rating   system   will perform when applied to standardized risk assessments  in the field , our  demonstration  suggests  it  has   potential to improve prediction and  may   offer  practical value for supervision agencies  looking to optimize their resource allocation ."
