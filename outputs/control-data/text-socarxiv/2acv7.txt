Abstract
The purpose of this study is to find why adult learners are unable to speak English as Foreign
language (EFL) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it tests the pedagogy of adopting the
strategy of Digital Story Telling (DST) in teaching English as a foreign language. The study is
applied on Northern Boarder University as a case study. The first question raised in this study is
whether the conventional methods of teaching are the reason behind their failure of speaking the
English language and whether the modification in the pedagogy of teaching affects the learners'
speaking skill. To this end, data are collected through a questionnaire. Furthermore, a model of a
teaching program, based on using DST strategy, is improved and tested with a group of learners at
the chosen university in Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that the learners at the selected
university find difficulty in speaking English, and that applying DST as a pedagogy help the
students to develop their overall speaking skill. These findings assist EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia
in creating a conducive atmosphere in and out their classes, which will motivate the learners a lot
to speak English fluently. The conclusion of the research recommends that EFL teachers should
modify their conventional methods of teaching English as a foreign language; they may apply the
strategy of using DST on their students to test the competence of the hypothesis.

Pedagogic Effectiveness of Digital Storytelling in Improving Speaking Skills

Introduction
According to Northwest Regional Education, the word “voice” refers to:
The writer coming through the words, the sense that a real person is speaking to us and
cares about the message. It is the heart and soul of the writing, the magic, the wit, the
feelings, the life and breath. When the writer is engaged personally with the topic, he or
she imparts a personal tone and flavor to the piece that is unmistakably his/her alone. (
2012, para.3)
Fisher (2007) adds that speaking refers to the distinctive human use of oral language in exchanging
and sharing his/her opinion, information and feeling. Such process of speaking aspires to attain a
mutual communication between both the listener and the speaker. Speaking is, in fact, a bilateral
process that includes generating, processing and getting information. Speaking is reported by
Second-Language (SL) students as the hardest skill to be proficient in. To be fluent in speaking as
a foreign language, students should have full knowledge in vocabularies, grammar and
pronunciation. Thus, speaking is the skill of putting the correct words in the right order with the
proper pronunciation and function (transaction and interaction). It is also the skill of knowing when
the accuracy of the message is essential (transaction/information exchange) and when précised
understanding is unnecessary (interaction/relation building).
Moreover, speaking addresses the social and cultural convention and standard. This study
tries to prove that the implementation of the pedagogy of digital storytelling will be helpful in
improving the students’ speaking ability for two reasons. The first reason, as indicated by Indrewan
(2013), is that a proper speech requires many elements, such as the language of speaking,
vocabulary profanity, the tone of voice, syntax, and self-development recommendation. The
second reason, on the other hand, is the critical requisite to examine the impact of using DST on
improving speaking skill. DST refers to the amalgamation of interactive media (such as video,
images, and audio) and storytelling to enhance the written and spoken phrases and to digitally
introduce stories to others (Meadows, 2003). Our emphasis is on proving that using DST as a
pedagogy improves speaking competence, critical thinking, performance and fluency.
Research Background: Literature Review
Speaking is the essence of communication. It is considered an interactive skill of forming meaning
which includes generating, getting, and processing information. Unfortunately, the conventional
method of teaching in Saudi Arabia is not a fruitful one. Students’ role is only restricted to receive
information. Consequently, students are not able to either speak or communicate in English
properly. Storytelling as a pedagogy can be used to develop the skill of speaking. Ahmed (2014)
assures that DST is the story that is told to either one or more listener via speech and body language
in the verbal telling. It serves as an active and coherent medium to convey the meaning. Zaro and
Saberri (1998) add that the activity of storytelling needs definite levels of communication between
listener and speaker or between storyteller and audience.
Alcantud-Dyaz, Ricart-Vayl, and Gregori-Signes (2014) conduct a research about the
probability of integrating digital storytelling into educational system for teaching particular
concepts and syllabus. It develops the students` level in various skills of learning including

teamwork, critical thinking, self- management, comprehension, reflection and fluency. In the same
year, another study has been carried out by Weigle (2014) who observes the deteriorated level of
the students due to the very limited chances to practice English. Their stress, excitement and lack
of confidence during speaking in class time have indicated the existence of problems in teaching
and learning English as a second language. Ratanapinyowong, Poopon, and Honsa (2007)
recommend the need for English curriculum to primarily focus on the listening and speaking skills.
This can be preceded by integrating activities in the classroom. Another good solution is suggested
by Burmark (2004). He finds that the integration of visual images with written text accelerates and
increases students’ ability of understanding. Another study by McHugh ( 2013) attributes the low
level of students to the gap that exists between the expectations of the students and the methods of
language acquisition. He assures that language learning can only occur through communicative
and implicit approaches. He recommends other methods such as TPR( Total Physical Response)
storytelling. Another solution is suggested in Bladick`s (2008) research that recommends short
story as a key element in motivating writing either as a model or as a subject matter. Arikan (2005)
points out that short stories with its setting, characters and compiling plot catch the attention of the
learners.
According to the Digital Storytelling Association (2002), digital storytelling adds
contemporary idioms to the earliest forms of storytelling. It is referred to as latest variation to
storytelling. It maintains peoples` perception, principles, and knowledge by narrating stories,
whereas new technologies are currently facilitating presenting and watching stories on both T.V
and computer screens (Digital Storytelling Association, 2010). Furthermore, digital storytelling
gives each person the chance to share his/her experiences with others and produce a social group
of people by narrating their personal stories (Meadows, 2003).
The Objectives of the Current Research
Speaking is the second skill of language, after listening, that requires a great deal of practice
including the way of pronouncing the sound; it is considered a direct tool to the listener whether
he gets the pronunciation or not (Tarigan, 1986). Based on this opinion, this research aims to use
storytelling as a means to integrate almost two communicative skills in each activity. It is regarded
a focused method to learners as it takes into account their experience, age, level, requirements and
motives (Doglas, 2004). Storytelling makes some remarkable pauses which occur in definite times
followed by body gestures and voice shifts to let a character practices vocalization, gestures
manners and pronunciation (Alkaaf, 2017).
DST can be simply defined as “the interactive art of using words and actions to revel the
elements and images of a story while encouraging the listener’s imagination” (Barrett, 2005, p .1).
This study proposes that DST can help in solving learners’ problems by:
a) Improving students` language practices through making language more ideal to messagebased communication and focusing on meaning, interaction and self-confidence.
b) Motivating students to be more confident.
c) Providing proper feedback and pronunciation.
d) Exploiting the natural tie between listening and speaking.
e) Giving students the opportunities to initiate oral communication.

f) Helping students to be aware of themselves and their world.
g) Providing natural connection between events and concepts.
h) Telling stories through images.
The researcher finds that the problems of the learners at the selected university are technical ones
that are primarily concerned with techniques and teaching strategies. These techniques are the
chief reason behind the failure of speaking EFL due to less practice and motivation. The major
aim of this study is to find out the potential relationship between learners` inability of choosing
vocabularies and grammar and even speaking in English on the one hand, and the strategy of
teaching on the other hand. If this relationship is found, a relevant question will be raised as
follows: Are there any possible strategies and pedagogies, related to the field of English language
teaching style, which can assist EFL teachers to adopt new strategies and methods in improving
students’ speaking ability?
Hypotheses
The observed failure of speaking English at the selected university in Saudi Arabia, as well as the
variance between the input and desired result, lets the researcher hypothesize that:
H1: Many adult EFL learners are unable to adopt English as a spoken language; they instead
use their mother- tongue language.
H2: The most important reason behind the inability of speaking is the failure in producing EFL
because of the limitation in using, pronunciation, stress and intonation, vocabularies, grammar and
fluency.
H3: There is an explicit correlation between speaking EFL and the methods and approaches of
teaching English.
H4: Employing DST pedagogy and strategy helps in bridging the gap (between the student and
the teacher) and developing speaking skills.
Research questions
To examine the validity of each hypothesis, the present study has been designed to answer the
following questions:
R1 : Do some adults of EFL learners in English majors in Saudi Arabia suffer from speaking
skills problem due to the lack of vocabulary and unawareness of grammar and proper
pronunciation.
R2 : Are there any relationship between the learners’ deficiencies and the methods of teaching.
R3 : Is there a direct relationship between strategies of teaching and adult learners’ speaking
competences.
R4: Can the use of DST pedagogy help learners develop their ability to speak English.

Methodology
`The present research investigates all of the above-mentioned issues, i.e., digital storytelling tools
and steps and the effect of applying DST as pedagogy. Quantitative and qualitative data have been
collected through (i) pre and post-tests (ii) a questionnaire. Quantitative data are generated by the
examination and interpretation of the statistical data. Integration of methods appears at certain
levels of data examination and interpretation. A questionnaire is designed to collect data from
learners regarding their feeling of self- confidence and the improvement of their speaking skills.
This questionnaire is administered after applying DST as pedagogy and how it motivates them to
speak more fluently. These data are analyzed to find out to what extent the learners’ speaking of
English is improved on the basis of the obtained results., The tentative usage of DST as pedagogy
is performed, applying the measures and strategies to help the learners improve their deficiencies
in speaking EFL.
Research Setting and the Participants
The study is conducted on participants from English-major students at a selected university in Saudi
Arabia. The participants are only girls. Their ages range from 18 to 22 years old. They have
undergone four years of training in English. English is taught as a foreign language in Saudi Arabia.
It is not expected to use spoken English anywhere except in their department with the non- Arabic
teachers.
Implementation Procedure
The experiment is carried out during six months. A meeting is held to the concerned students twice
a week; each session lasts for 90 minutes. At the beginning of the study, the students’ entry-level
English and computer literacy are evaluated. Then, the processes of making DST are explained by
the teacher. Furthermore, the students are trained to use computer programs related to DST. The
instructor herself gives a sample, applying the stages and processes of making DST to her learners.
Stages of Digital Storytelling strategy:
DS has four stages: preproduction, production, postproduction and distribution (Yang &Wu, 2012)
Pre-production comprises five stages as follows: a) Begging questions in certain situations, b)
Examining relevant information, c) Writing the dialogue and evolving peer review, d) Performing
spoken storytelling, and e) Drawing a story diagram and storyboard.( Park & Baek, 2011) elucidates
the stages of DS as it encompasses both Storybird and Storyboarding as follows:
1. Storybird: It is a very attractive mutual story writing website which in
2. cludes creating, reading, and sharing. Moreover, it is a collaborative DS instrument which
lets students concentrate more on the content of their script instead of drawing pictures.
3. Storyboard: It lets the user design pictures, manuscript, action, music and interviews prior
to making his/her digital story. Furthermore, it gives the user the opportunity to think about
how the narrative will be composed
Process of Digital Storytelling
Frazel (2010) divides the development of DS into three phases: preparation, production, and
presentation.

1. Preparation Phase: Throughout this phase, it is possible for the learners to establish a concept
map, make storyboards, and form a script for printed manuscript or narration. The instructor
has to make a formative assessment rubric to aid in directing the learners all throughout action.
The instructor and learners identify their audience and decide their preference of the final
product (podcast or video) and the way in which it will be accessible (i.e., in class or uploaded
to the website). They arrange the materials and feature the DS project/task. The instructor will
choose at this moment whether to have learners work as persons in small groups, or as an entire
group of students. Moreover, the instructor has to make a formative assessment. As part of the
preparation of the task, instructors may prefer to make a preliminary DS regarding the theme
and let the learners come up with ways to find connotation, viewpoint, or touching links of
their own.
2. Production phase: As soon as the entire resources and storyboard are prepared and directed by
a partial script and formative assessment rubric, the learnerswill start producing the work. The
learners choose audio and visual aspects of the DS. If they make a video product, they may use
a power point presentation. Directed by script and storyboard, the learner gets ready for the
narration. The instructor’s role is to guide, depending on grade level. He also helps in managing
the activities such as ordering and timing the slides. It is also possible to use sound effects and
music.
3. Presentation Stage: DS ought to be either archived onto a CD or saved onto a file-sharing site.
It is either played for the students in the class or uploaded to the website. There are numerous
kinds of applications that are designed for digital stories and digital story-making. There is
traditional DS; there are also Weblogs, e-Portfolios and photo essays. Thus, DS usually
launches with a script. The storyteller puts prosperous media together to support the themes
and feeling in that script, such as personal or public domain images, music or other audio
effects, animations or video, and further electronic features. The storyteller makes, organizes
and edits DS, producing a short film whose duration typically ranges between two and four
minutes, in one of the different file formats (Lambert, 2002, 2009; Meadows & Kidd, 2009).
` After the instructor finishes her explanation, she asked the learners to select a topic on
which they can apply DST. She divides them into groups; each group select an exciting theme
according to their point of views. They begin immediately to form questions, brainstorm and
watch movies, slide shows, and YouTube. Subsequently, they begin to write the first script and
arrange their clipboard. They make up their stories and revise them. The instructor discusses
what they finish and give them the necessary feedback. They know what to change regarding
word choice, spelling, capitalization, punctuations and the structure of the sentence. After
revising their mistakes, the learners put the second script in order; at the same time, they work
on the storyboard in which the graphic presentation of the script with particular characters is
selected. They begin to select the effectual music and tones. They record their voices in
accordance with their selected characters in the narrative. After the instructor gives them the
second feedback, they correct their mistakes in pronunciation and performance. They choose
the appropriate program through which they can publish their digital storybooks. In the end,
the instructor and all the groups listen to the stories and tell the writer their feedback.

Findings of the Present Research
The quantitative findings of the current study are presented, according to the hypotheses of the
study using the statistical package sciences (SPSS), as follows:
Finding of the hypothesis (1)
The first hypothesis states that there is a statistically considerable distinction between the mean
scores of pre and post assessment of the study sample in the general EFL speaking skill in favor
of post assessment. Table 1 presents the students mean scores, standard deviations, t- value and
level of significance of the pre and post assessments of the study sample. As shown in table 1,
there is a statistically considerable dissimilarity between the mean score of the pre and post
assessment of the study sample in overall EFL speaking skills in favor of post assessment in which
"t" value is (27.595) which is the significant at the (0.01) level of significance. Thus, the first
hypothesis is supported.

The second hypothesis states that there is a statistically major distinction between the mean
scores of pre and post assessments of the study sample in EFL speaking production process in line
with the followings:
o There is a statistically major distinction between the mean scores of preand post
assessments of the study sample in vocabulary choice in favor of post assessment.
o There is a statistically major distinction between the mean scores of preand post
assessments of the study sample in correct grammar in favor of post assessment.
o There is a statistically distinction between the mean scores of preandpost
assessments of the study sample in correct pronunciation in favor of post assessment.
o There is a statistically major distinction between the mean scores of pre and post
assessments of the study sample in fluency and performance in favor of post assessment.
o
There is a statistically major distinction between the mean scores of pre and post
assessments of the study sample in stress and intonation in favor of post assessment.
As shown in table 2, there is a statistically major distinction between the mean score of the pre and
post assessments of the study sample in EFL production speaking process in favor of post
assessment in which "t" value is (14.967) for vocabulary choice, (13.572) for using correct
grammar, (16.765) for pronunciation, (22.182) for fluency and performance, (18.575) for using
stress and intonation which is significant at (0.01) level of significance. Thus, the second
hypothesis is supported.
Findings of the hypothesis (3) and (4)
The third hypothesis states that there is a direct connection between the failure of speaking EFL
and the strategies of teaching, whereas the fourth hypothesis affirms that using DST pedagogy
helps in improving the speaking skill of the students. A questionnaire is designed so as to prove
the validity of these two hypotheses according to the learners` comments that are analyzed to
support the research findings. This questionnaire is administrated to learners (N = 40), after the
strategy is implemented to examine the learners` opinions of applying DST as a pedagogy. The
participants are asked to rate 19 items on a four- point likert scale (i.e. 4= strongly agree, 3 = agree,
2= neutral 1 = disagree). The items are divided into two sections:
(1) The learners` estimation about DST and how it is considered different from the
traditional methods of teaching.
(2) How the phases and processes of DST enable the learners to improve their general
speaking skills.
All the analyzed responses are used for reporting the learners` perceptions so as to support the
third and fourth hypothesis. Generally, on account of using DST strategy, the majority of learners
felt exited when narrating their stories. Thus, the third and fourth hypotheses are supported.

Figure 1. Questionnaire responses, Section 1,2: learners’ opinion regarding the storytelling
strategy and how it helped them in improving their overall speaking skills.
Figure 1 points up that 92.5% of the learners report that they have benefited from using DST as a
strategy in general. They mention that the strategy enables them to choose the proper vocabulary
and to use the correct structure. Figure 1 of the questionnaire represents the analysis of the answer
of 19 items, to find whether there is a relationship between the ability of speaking English as a
foreign language and the ways of teaching or not. In general, about 90% of the learners’ answers
assure that DST strategy prompts them to draw on spoken English. Moreover, it helps them be
aware of the distinction between vocabulary practice and correct grammar; the matter that is
different from the traditional methods of teaching that relies on just memorizing and receiving
information without any participation. In addition, during the administration of the questionnaire,
the learners orally remark that they have discovered that the application of DST is very pleasant
and help them a lot not only in mastering the English language, but also in overcoming all
psychological difficulties that previously make them incapable of speaking English as a foreign
language. It enables them to voice their thoughts, get over hesitation, be full of energy, havea
proper communication skill, convey their views, form their imagination, have a good performance
and use eye contacts. A total of (93.1%) enjoy the strategy, for the reason that they preferred to

work cooperatively. Furthermore, (89%) of the learners state that this strategy help them
developing the general speaking skills. In addition to that, (95%) of them believe that it will
improve their performance in speaking language.
What is more, (90%) of the learners have mentioned that DST strategy effectively assess
them, and (87%) of them share what they have visualized during storytelling with other students.
Egan (2005) confirms that DST facilitates the oral presentation and correct vocabulary usage in
the production phase of the story creation. Colon-vila (1997) adds that it helps in developing the
ability of written and oral communication, since comprehension of the narrative schema has been
improved.
It is commonly acclaimed that the strategy of cooperative learning is one of the most
helpful ways in the process of education (Ellis, 2009), because the students have the opportunity
to communicate effectively and employ new vocabularies. (92%) of the learners have agreed that
they choose visual and audio elements of their DST; the matter that improve their ability of choice
and listening properly. (94.3%) of them have concluded that the storyteller collects rich media to
sustain their thoughts and feelings; he/she selects the proper tone and music cautiously to assist
him/her in expressing the characters of the tale. Doquili (2000) mentions that the author or the
storyteller is supposed to become skilled at different rules that are related to the skills of language;
for instance, grammar, pronunciation, spelling, and vocabulary. Consequently, the storyteller is
required to be able to express the current mood through movement, tone, stress and intonation.
Conclusion
The present study seeks to prove that combining digital storytelling strategy with the traditional
ways of teaching adult EFL learners in Saudi Arabia at the particular university gives these learners
the opportunity to be provided with many vocabularies and motivates them to work cooperatively.
Moreover, this combination enables them to learn how to use proper grammar and enriches them
with new vocabularies. It has also improved their speaking skill by mastering stress, tone and
intonation. This research can help learners change their pessimistic view about their inability to
communicate in English. It recommends that EFL instructors shall replicate the experiment by
modifying the conventional techniques of teaching to create an amusing atmosphere among
learners.
