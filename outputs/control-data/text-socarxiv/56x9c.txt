A Longitudinal Typology of Neighbourhood-level Social Fragmentation:
A Finite Mixture Model Approach

Abstract
Neighbourhoods are social enclaves. And, from an epidemiological vantage there is substantive
research examining how social traits of neighbourhoods affect health. However, this research has often
focused on the effects of social deprivation. Less attention has been given to social fragmentation (SF),
a construct aligned with the notions of lesser: social cohesion, social capital, collective functioning, and
social isolation. Concurrently, there has been limited research that has described the spatial and
temporal patterning of neighbourhood-level social traits. With a focus on SF the main aims of this
paper were to model and describe the time-varying and spatial nature of SF.
Conceptually, this research was informed by ‘thinking in time’ and by the ‘lifecourse-of-place’
perspective. While, from an analytical perspective, a longitudinal (3-time points over 10-years)
neighbourhood database was created for the metropolitan region of Adelaide, Australia. Latent
Transition Analysis was then used to model the developmental profile of SF where neighbourhoods
were proxied by ‘suburbs’, and the measurement model for SF was formed of 9-conceptually related
census-based indicators. A four-class, nominal-level latent status model of SF was identified: classA=low SF; class-B=mixed-level SF/inner urban; class-C=mixed-level SF/peri-urban; and class-D=high
SF. Class-A and -D neighbourhoods were the most prevalent at all time points. And, while certain
neighbourhoods were inferred to have changed their SF class across time, most neighbourhoods were
characterised by intransience.

Introduction and Background

Neighbourhood change has long motivated enquiry. Indeed, many contemporary studies into
neighbourhood change resonate with research from the Chicago School of Urban Sociology in the early-tomid twentieth century (Harris and Feng 2016). Prominent within the Chicago School was a perspective that
cities were social ecologies and neighbourhoods natural areas that evolved and regressed through social
mobility processes such as invasion and succession (Lutters 1996, Schwirian 1983). Since, the study of
neighbourhood change has been advanced via a range of theories, these variously grounded in subjects
that include economics, humanism, individualism, complexity, justice and political economy (Clark 2008,
Hirsch et al. 2017, Joseph 2008, Meen 2013, Schwirian 1983).
In spite of interest in neighbourhood change, much of the applied research has arguably been
“unidimensional”, focused on singular neighbourhood-level traits, for example population density, income,
poverty, housing, race, ethnicity, crime or violence (Delmelle 2015, p.1). Treating neighbourhoods as
unidimensional can overlook the “bundle of spatially based attributes” that come together to define the
character of a neighborhood (Galster 2001, p.2112); it can also mask within- and across-neighbourhood
variability on the basis of co-varying neighbourhood-level characteristics.
However, there is a growing body of research that addresses neighbourhood change from a multidimensional vantage. Much of this research applies a range of methods to capture the multidimensional
character of neighbourhoods in space and time as well as across space and time through the construction
of neighbourhood typologies formulated from arrays of indicators. Examples of applied methods for the
multivariate study of neighbourhood change include cluster analysis (Mikelbank 2011, Morenoff and Tienda
1997), self-organising maps (Delmelle et al. 2013, Ling and Delmelle 2016), latent class models (Richardson
et al. 2014, Weden et al. 2011), Markov models (Delmelle and Thill 2014, Delmelle et al. 2016), transition
matrices (Solari 2012) and, latent class growth analysis (Apparicio et al. 2015, Séguin et al 2015); applied
either alone or in step-wise combination with tools such as discriminant analysis (Wei and Knox 2014),
principal components analysis (Owens 2012, Salvati et al. 2018), and sequential pattern mining algorithmic
techniques (Delmelle 2016).
Although researchers are attentive to capturing neighbourhood change from a multidimensional vantage,
their focus has, in general, remained on expressing the longitudinal multivariate socioeconomic and or
sociodemographic character of neighbourhoods. Moreover, many multivariate studies have examined
neighbourhood change either through comparisons of cross-sectional neighbourhood profiles modelled
repeatedly across time or via the measurement and linkage of neighbourhoods across only two time points
(Delmelle 2016, Weden et al 2011, Wei and Knox 2014).

Aims

This study aims to model the neighbourhood-level evolution of social fragmentation from 2001 to 2011,
across three time points, within the urban metropolitan context of the city of Adelaide, Australia. Research
questions examined are: What is the typological nature of neighbourhood-level social fragmentation? And,
to what extent do neighbourhoods transition into different states of social fragmentation (categories) over
time?

1.3

A ‘Neighbourhood-Centred’ Latent-Variable Approach to Change

Neighbourhoods are arguably multifaceted, if not complex constructs that may not easily reduce to a single
indicator or an observable metric (Lekkas et al. 2017a, 2017b, Warner and Settersten 2016, Weden et al.
2011). A methodological approach able to model complex constructs, from a latent perspective, is latent
class analysis (Collins and Lanza 2010).1 Latent class theory provides the conceptual, mathematical and
statistical framework to measure categorical latent variables. Categorical latent variables can encode
observed information from a set of measures, accommodating intricacy through an inductive generative
process. They do so on the basis of a measurement model encompassing two or more observed categorical
indicators that function to reflect an underlying grouping variable (Collins and Lanza 2010).
As distinct from the relationships that exist between a set of indicators, the substantive focus of LCA is, as
such, on the within-subject patterning of assembled indicators. On this basis LCA is often referred to as a
person-centred, or pattern-oriented approach. Moreover, the focus of LCA enables the identification of
heterogeneity within a population; a process that facilitates the segmentation of the population into
homogeneous subgroups, each having a distinctive nature that enables these segments to function as
epidemiological contrasts.
Applied to the study of neighbourhoods, and within- and across neighbourhood-level typological
configuration, LCA can be framed as a neighbourhood-centred approach (Warner and Settersten 2016); an
approach that situates the neighbourhood unit at the forefront of both conceptual thinking and applied
analyses (Warner and Settersten 2016). Within the schema of a LC-model, a neighbourhood centred
approach aims to configure the clustering of neighbourhoods on the basis of a shared nature into types or
classes, which are both empirically and qualitatively distinct from others in the series. Moreover, in framing
neighbourhood types through a LC-approach, neighbourhoods are considered holistically, with their
underlying (latent) nature reflective of the intersection of modelled features (Warner and Settersten 2016,
Weden et al. 2011).

In keeping with the literature, throughout this paper the phrase “latent class” is often used in a broad inclusive manner so as
to succinctly encapsulate both latent class and latent transition analysis.

Measurement approaches related to and inclusive of LCA have been applied to the study of
neighbourhoods (for example, McDonald et al. 2012, Palumbo et al. 2016, Wall et al. 2012). Less readily
applied have been longitudinal extensions of LCA that aim to characterise, configure and model the
evolution in the nature of neighbourhoods (for example, Richardson et al. 2014).2 Modelling
neighbourhoods over time using a discrete and categorical latent variable approach has the capacity to
reveal insights able to complement existing research concerned with neighbourhood dynamics (Lekkas et
al. 2017a, 2017b, Weden et al. 2011). Moreover, LCA and its longitudinal extensions, offer advantages to
alternative methods that form the basis of many extant enquiries such as factor analytic methods, and
cluster analysis techniques. These advantages have been outlined elsewhere (Lekkas et al. 2017a). In brief
they are: insight into the manner by which a set of measures come together to reflect and characterise
distinct neighbourhood archetypes while obviating the need for a series of higher order interaction terms; a
measurement model, which can accommodate uncertainty and measurement error; a model-based
approach to data reduction and clustering that enables the use of classical statistical criteria to assess
model traits such as model fit; the probabilistic assignment of neighbourhoods – the units of analysis – to
classes and dynamic profiles (latent statuses), a process that can reduce misclassification bias; and, a
flexible structural model that can be applied to assess the stability or change of neighbourhood types over
time, as well as mechanisms associated with the evolution of neighbourhood types, and therein
neighbourhood change.

1.4

Neighbourhood-level Social Fragmentation and Social Typographies

Neighbourhoods are intrinsically about people; embodying and reflecting their social conditions of living.
An integral component of these conditions are factors such as social attachment, social support, social
capital, collective efficacy, social cohesion and social integration, or its inverse social fragmentation (Baum
and Palmer 2002, Berkman et al. 2000, Ivory et al. 2012). These social factors vary by levels of magnitude in
their distribution across residential spaces (Hanibuchi et al. 2012a, 2012b), and across time (Schmidt et al.
2014). They have also been tied to population-levels of well-being, quality of life, and health (Ivory et al.
2011, Jones et al. 2014, Lucumi et al. 2015). Moreover, factors such as social fragmentation are distinct
from recognised neighbourhood-level traits such as material deprivation, differing: conceptually, in their
measurement, in their socio-spatial patterning, and in their relationships to health and social outcomes
(Congdon 2004, Fagg et al 2008, Ivory et al 2012).

The studies by Meyer et al (2015) and Weden et al (2011) applied LCA to profile neighbourhoods at two or more time
points. However, neither of these studies formally applied advanced longitudinal extensions of LCA in their analyses; rather
these studies compared and contrasted cross-sectional LC-structures that were modelled across time. In comparison,
Richardson et al (2014) applied the apparatus of longitudinal LCA (L-LCA) to model the neighbourhood profiles from a
socioeconomic perspective across 20-years and 5-time points.

It may not always be possible to directly measure neighbourhood-levels of social fragmentation. Indirect
approaches to the measurement of social fragmentation include the Congdon Index (Congdon 1996), and
the New Zealand (NZ) Index of Neighbourhood Fragmentation (Ivory et al. 2012). These two indices are
aggregate measures that respectively amalgamate a cogent set of census-based derived variables of
population and household characteristics considered foundational to the context of social fragmentation
(Ivory et al. 2012).
In formulating the NZ Index of Neighbourhood Fragmentation, Ivory et al. (2011, p1995) introduced the
notion of a social topography, a concept expressed to represent the “characteristics of the group [which]
act as the foundation upon which the group operates.” Applied to neighbourhood-level social
fragmentation, Ivory et al. (2011, p.1995) stated that a social topography represents the set of conditions
which have coalesced to establish the ground “for the level of integration and regulation within the group
and therefore the level of social support available to members (probably in a recursive manner). A given
social topography may be regarded as socially fragmenting if it inhibits integration and regulation in the
social group.”
From a conceptual perspective, the notion of a social typography readily aligns with a neighbourhoodcentred latent variable approach. To date, social fragmentation has not been explored in this manner.
Moreover, no study has examined the temporal behaviour of a neighbourhood’s fragmenting conditions.

1.5

Data and Methods

The longitudinal nature of neighbourhood-level social fragmentation was modelled through the application
of latent transition analysis (LTA). A general overview of the methodological approach is provided here,
with the detailed methods described thereafter. In brief, the first step involved the development of a
longitudinal spatio-temporal neighbourhood database. The database was formed using neighbourhoodlevel census data, for applicable neighbourhoods within the Adelaide metropolitan region, Australia, for the
years 2001, 2006, and 2011. In the next step, at each time point, neighbourhood-level social fragmentation
was measured as a latent categorical variable. This enabled the grouping of neighbourhoods with a similar
nature of social fragmentation at the beginning of the study period, as well as over time. The model of
change was discrete (categorical), with a discrete model of change making no assumptions as to the form of
change, for example linear or quadratic (Collins and Lanza 2010); in this manner neighbourhoods may be
characterised to change along a complex array of paths.

Study area

The study setting was the metropolitan region of Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. Adelaide is
the fifth largest city, by population, in Australia with an increase in population from some 1-million in 2001
to approximately 1.2-million in 2011 (ABS 2011a). The metropolitan boundary, delimiting the outer spatial
extent of neighbourhoods encompassed within this study, was defined by the ABS Adelaide Capital City
Statistical Division (ASD, Figure 1-1; ABS 2012). The ASD boundary was considered appropriate for this
analysis as the focus was on urban neighbourhoods. An alternative boundary recently designated by the
ABS – the Greater Adelaide Statistical Area (GASA) – is a boundary that stretches to include small-to-large
peri-urban populations and townships. However, peri-urban and rural localities were considered unsuitable
for these analyses given likely differences in both the levels of social fragmentation between urban and
peri-urban/rural contexts (Ivory et al. 2012), and the developmental processes associated with these
respective geographies (Friel et al. 2011). In addition, substantive decreases in population density are
generally evident for neighbourhoods at, and beyond the margins of the ASD.

Spatial - neighbourhood - unit

In the context of this study suburbs were operationalised as neighbourhoods. Australian suburbs are
designated localities officially gazetted by the Geographical Place Name authority in each of the federated
states and territories. While the ABS, the Statutory Authority responsible for the conduct of the national
Census, does not formally recognise the suburb within its geographic framework (formerly the Australian
Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC), currently the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)),
it supports a spatial approximation to these gazetted localities, this being the State Suburb (SSC; ABS 2016).
For 2011 boundaries and census-based statistics, SSCs are produced via the aggregation of one or more
Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1s). Analogous to the notion of a census tract an SA1 is the smallest geographic
area for which most 2011 Census data are released.3
A number of reasons underlined the selection of the suburb as a proxy for neighbourhoods. Suburbs are
ubiquitous in the Australian context, forming an integral component of urban life (Davison 1995, Randolph
and Freestone 2008). Beyond a spatial or locational geography, suburbs are also sociological and relational
entities that evoke a sense of home, place and territory, socio-physical homogeneity, social connection, and
access (Howard 2011, Simic 2008). In addition, in terms of population size, the suburbs of Adelaide
approximate the scale of US-based census tracts (these ranging in size from 1200 to 8000 people; United
States Census Bureau, 2001), and are congruent with the WHO’s expression of a neighbourhood (WHO
2016). Furthermore, perceptions have softened with regards to the hierarchical divide that often
positioned cities and their suburbs as distinct and divided geographies (Florida 2017).
1.5.3

Neighbourhood spatio-temporal database

To explore change over time at the suburb (neighbourhood) level, a longitudinal database was developed
based on the SSC. For this purpose data were drawn from two sources. First, digital boundaries, in the form
of ESRI Shapefiles for the 2001, 2006 and 2011 SSCs were attained from the ABS (ABS 2001a, ABS 2006b,
ABS 2011b). These geographic data were complemented with property-level data (spatial boundary files
encompassing all legal land parcels (dwelling points) including their attributes) attained from the South
Australian Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB), for years 2001, and 2006; a database provided by the Land
Services Group, South Australian Government, Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure.
On account of factors that include population change, the boundaries for many small-area census
geographies are readily morphed between successive censuses. This impedes and challenges spatiotemporal research. To enable spatio-temporal exploration a consistent geographical approach was adopted
through the harmonisation of boundaries (Norman et al. 2003). The harmonisation of geography was

In 2011 the ABS changed its system of census geographies on the basis of a change to its underlying spatial framework. This
change saw the SA1 spatial unit replace the previous smallest area division; the census district (CD). However, in broad terms
the CD and SA1 represent comparable spatial scales, each accommodating on average between 200-300 households. For
2001 and 2006 ABS generated SSC were based on the aggregation of CDs.

achieved by fixing the 2001 and 2006 SSC boundaries to the 2011 SSC boundaries. The longitudinal
database then functioned to bridge data from these prior census periods to the 2011 SSC boundaries. In its
approach, this method was analogous to the process used to create the US-based Longitudinal Tract
Database (LTDB; Logan et al. 2014). Moreover, the advantage of adopting a forwards-oriented approach
was that it captured and accounted for the manifestation of new neighbourhoods and the morphing of
others.
Following on from geographic harmonisation, creation of the socio-spatial time series was based on the
conceptual framework and methodology outlined by Simpson (2002). Within a Geographic Information
System (ESRI ArcGIS 10.3), the first step in the process, was to overlay the 2011 SSC boundary file
respectively onto the 2001 and 2006 SSC boundary files thereby linking every SSC base unit for given census
years to at least one 2011 SSC (allowing for the intersection of 2001 or 2006 SSCs with multiple 2011 SSCs).
Given overlap in boundaries across years the conversion of data from one time period to another required
approximation. Approximation was necessary for this task as no direct population-based measures existed
to apportion data from the source to target geography on the basis of the extent of the overlap intersection
(Norman 2004). For apportionment, the spatial distribution of residential dwellings was considered a
suitable proxy indicator and weighting criterion (Simpson 2002). Ancillary data, attained from the DCDB,
was therefore drawn into the GIS, with the spatial distribution of dwellings used to construct weights for
SSC-level ‘population’ characteristics from prior census years within the 2011 SSC boundaries. When a SSC
was completely contained within the boundaries of a single 2011 SSC a weighting of 1.0 (or 100%) was
assigned to it. When a 2001 or 2006 SSC was located in more than one 2011 SSC, the ratio of its dwellings
residing within each of the 2011 SSC intersected fragments formed a weight whose value was greater than
0 but less than 1, with weights for records of the same source SSC unit summing to 1. The culmination of
this process was the generation of a 2001-to-2006 SSC to 2011 SSC geography conversion table (Simpson
2002) with derived SSC-level indicators estimated by using equation-1:

𝑦̂ 𝑡 = ∑
𝑡

𝑑𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠|𝑡
𝑦
𝑑𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑠

[1]

where 𝑦̂ 𝑡 is the estimated indicator value for an SSC, 𝑦𝑠 is the indicator value for the source SSC, 𝑑𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠
is the number of dwellings within the source SSC, and 𝑑𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠|𝑡 is the number of dwellings in the zone of
intersection between the source SSC and the corresponding SSC.
While interpolation based on a combination of area and population weighting is the current standard in the
field (Logan et al 2014), interpolation based on dwellings afforded more realistic weights than those
assigned from simple areal interpolation as the latter assumes a uniform distribution of the data to be
weighted (Goodchild and Lam 1980, Simpson 2002); an assumption that was unlikely for the set of

8

population attributes of interest. To the extent that dwellings are highly correlated with and therefore
representative of underlying population attributes, this procedure also afforded advantages compared with
weighting SSC fragments by their area alone (Gregory and Ell 2005, Simpson 2002).
On the basis that uncertainty is introduced in the conversion of data between geographic units of differing
nature, data outputs for target SSC units are estimates (Simpson 2002). To ascertain the extent of
estimation involved in data conversion two additional statistics were generated: the degree of hierarchy
and the degree of fit (Simpson 2002). The degree of hierarchy (equation-2) reflects the percentage of
source units (‘s’, here SSCs) with weight ‘w’ equal to one (i.e. 2001 or 2006 SSCs units wholly contained
within a given target unit (‘t’, here 2011 SSCs)). Given its nature as an estimator of perfect correspondence,
the degree of hierarchy “can be quite low even for geographies that are approximately equal” (Simpson
2002, p.77). Conversely, the degree of fit (equation-3) sums the maximum weight for each source unit
expressed as a percentage for all source units. In this manner “the degree of fit shows more precisely the
proportion of data that is not subject to estimation” and can make evident the scale of correspondence
(Simpson 2002, p.77).

Time

A 10-year time-span was considered suitable for the study of change in urban contexts at the small arealevel on the basis that it represents a sufficient interval for evolution to unfold and become evident. For
example, in a US-based study across 5-years, where census tracts functioned as proxies for
neighbourhoods, Mair et al. (2015) observed marked declines in neighbourhood-levels of social stress and
violence, as well as increased levels of social cohesion and safety. Wight et al. (2013) analogously reported
on neighbourhood-level change through the purview of US-based census tracts, documenting substantive
changes in the proportion of unemployed persons, this time across a 10-year period. Ten years was also the
time period used to study the spatial distribution and temporal trends in social fragmentation at a small
area geographical level for the whole of England and its associated administrative regions (Grigoroglou et
al. 2019). While locally, for the years from 2001-to-2006, Kupke et al. (2011) noted one in five of Adelaide’s
suburbs had experienced at least a 50-percent increase in the level of medium density development. And,
Coffee et al. (2016) chronicled noticeable 10-year patterns of change in population density across the
geographic extent of metropolitan Adelaide.

9

Multivariate analyses have also highlighted the propensity of neighbourhoods to exhibit multidimensional
change over time periods in the range of 10-years. For example, Delmelle and Thill (2014) noted a
moderate level of temporal instability in the classification of neighbourhoods assigned to three of five
quality of life classes across ten-years.4 While, Weden et al. (2011) classified a quarter of census-tract
defined neighbourhoods into a different archetype at a second time point measured ten years after the
first.5 In addition, many neighbourhood-level intervention programs often set themselves short-to-medium
term horizons to effect observable change. For example: ‘The New Deal for Communities’ programme, a
United Kingdom based initiative, aimed over 10-years to positively transform deprived neighbourhoods
(Lawless et al. 2010). Analogously, the US-based Building Healthy Communities initiative, is a 10-year, $1billion plan that aims to transform the health supporting nature of neighbourhoods (BHC Connect 2017).
And, a series of area-based initiatives in Andalusia, Spain, implemented over a time frame spanning from 7to-15 years, were designed to induce neighbourhood change for the purpose of affecting social inequities
(Moya et al. 2017). While, White et al. (2017), through a natural experiment, observed impacts on mental
health 7-years after a Welsh situated “Communities First” area-level regeneration program.
Although neighbourhoods can and do evolve in the short-to-medium term, neighbourhoods are often
characterised by trait-based stability over such intervals. For example, in their examination of the
socioeconomic status of Chicago’s neighbourhoods, across a period of twenty years, Sampson and
Morenoff (2006, p.176) observed “decidedly more variation between neighbourhoods than there [was]
change within neighbourhoods over time.” This durability of character was also evident across the
neighbourhoods of Los Angeles, as reported in a more recent analysis that spanned an analogous period of
time (Sampson et al. 2017). Moreover, for Chicago, the durable socioeconomic nature of its
neighbourhoods was found to be structured and reinforced by the initial set of neighbourhood-level
socioeconomic conditions (Sampson and Morenoff 2006); though such path dependence was not as
evident for the neighbourhoods of Los Angeles (Sampson et al. 2017). Durability again was the
predominant characteristic that arose in the ten-year analysis of the spatial patterning of social
fragmentation in England as reported by Grigoroglou et al. (2019).
From an analytic perspective, invariant or rarely changing characteristics, such as a (near) stable long-run
neighbourhood trait, may be considered of peripheral interest, or as a statistical nuisance (Bell and Jones
2015, Gunasekara et al. 2014). This despite the capacity for (near) unchanging, time-invariant variables and
processes to effect time-varying variables and processes (Bell and Jones 2015); a facet exemplified by the

In the study by Delmelle and Thill (2014) neighbourhoods were defined on the basis of Neighbourhood Statistical Areas.
Moreover, neighbourhoods were assigned to a quality of life class based on a composite index composed of 17-indicators.

In the study by Weden et al (2011) neighbourhoods were measured using a set of some 32-indicators capturing features of

composition.

2015). And, it equally may be that for a neighbourhood-level characteristics such as social fragmentation,
that stability, for example, at a low level, is requisite for the staging of social integration and regulation.
1.5.5

Measures

Data for the measurement of neighbourhood-level social fragmentation were sourced from the national
Census of Population and Housing, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), for years 2001, 2006 and 2011
(ABS 2001b, 2006a, 2011c). The five-yearly national census provides rich information on the characteristics
of the Australian people and their dwellings, with data provided at a number of geographic levels.
For given census years, the ABS provides two population counts for census data; these respectively are
based on the enumerated and usual place of residence. The enumerated count encompasses the number
of people usually resident or transient (for example visitors, night-shift workers) in a particular area on the
given Census night. In contrast, the usual residence count reflects the characteristics of residents
irrespective of where those residents were on the Census night. For this study, with few exceptions, the
indicators used to reflect neighbourhood-level social fragmentation were derived from the usual place of
residence count.
1.5.5.1 Social fragmentation
Latent class theory suggests there are underlying, or hidden, subgroups in a population. This heterogeneity
cannot be directly observed but must be inferred from a set of categorical items. In this study the
measurement model for neighbourhood-level social fragmentation was based on a set of nine censusderived indicators, namely: home ownership, residential stability, single-person households, married
persons, non-family households, children, migrants, non-English language speakers, and long-term
residents. These nine indicators of area-level social fragmentation stem from the work of Ivory et al. (2011,
2012). The indicators capture three dimensions which inter-relate, and are theorised to “`fragment'
neighbourhood collective social functioning” (Ivory et al. 2012, p.975). The three dimensions represented
by Ivory et al.’s (2012) nine measures are: norms and values, social resources and attachment. Moreover,
these dimensions represent: the `how' (limited means of communicating norms and values across
neighbourhoods); the `who' (neighbourhood social resources); and the `why' (levels of attachment to
people and place) of fragmenting social (neighbourhood) conditions (Ivory et al. 2012).
Within the context of this study the nine indicators were operationalised as follows: home ownership place of usual residence owned outright, with a mortgage or on a rent to buy scheme; residential stability persons who had been resident at their usual address as per one year ago; single-person households - a one
person residence; married persons - couples in a registered marriage or in an identified de facto relationship
inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex couples; non-family households - nonrelated persons resident in a ‘group’ household or share house (i.e. flatmates); children - persons aged 14-

11

years and younger; recent immigrants - persons born overseas who had arrived in Australia less than five
years ago; non-English language speaking proficiency - residents who do not speak English well or at all;
and, long-term residents6 - persons who had been resident at their usual address as per five years ago.
Each of the nine census indicators was initially calculated as a proportion based on the underlying
population in each neighbourhood unit at each of the time points, with 2001 and 2006 indicators
subsequently weighted to enable spatio-temporal concordance as previously discussed (section 5.5.3).
Thereafter, for LC-analyses all proportions were dichotomised via median splits that were time-varying in
nature. Dichotomisation was undertaken for two reasons: concerns related to the over-extraction of latent
classes when latent classes are enumerated with their indicator variables in continuous form (Bray B. per
comms. 2015);7 and, the distributional properties of a number of the indicators, specifically excessive
kurtosis (see table-1.2).
While mitigating some issues, there was however cognisance that dichotomisation could introduce others;
namely information loss through a reduction in heterogeneity (MacCallum et al. 2002), and therein the
identification of incomplete subgroups. In addition, there was awareness of dichotomisation potentially
impacting the meaningfulness of identified classes through its effects on within-class homogeneity and
across-class heterogeneity where values at the extremes of their associated indicator distributions were
treated equally with those just above or below their respective median splits. Recent simulation analyses,
albeit involving latent classes reflective of count-based indicators, however suggests that such concerns
may be unfounded. Specifically, in circumstances where the number of estimated classes was greater than
the number of indicators in the measurement model, median split dichotomisation did not affect the
quality of mixture recovery, or bias parameter estimates (Macia and Wickham 2018).
From an applied perspective consideration has previously been afforded to the impact of dichotomisation
in LC-models. Notably Weden et al. (2011, 2010) examined the latent structure of a sample of US-based
census tracts across two time points, 10-years apart, with latent classes identified using some 32 measures
which were primarily dichotomised using median splits. Of relevance here, Weden et al. (2011, 2010)
conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing modelled heterogeneity against a scenario where the indicators
were applied in their original continuous-variable form. On the basis of their analysis the latent class

Bray (2015, per comms.): “Regarding issues of model identification, selection, and interpretation there are a number of
idiosyncratic issues that arise when using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), mostly due to the nature of mixtures of normal
distributions being unbounded. LPAs can be difficult to identify (in terms of the ML-solution), particularly when item variances
are not restricted to be equal across classes, which is an assumption that is sometimes not palatable; they often have poorer
model identification than LCAs with the same number of indicators. Models can also often be difficult to select because the AIC,
BIC and other fit criteria often continue to prefer larger and larger models; they often have poorer entropy than LCAs with the
same number of indicators. In terms of interpretation, the concept of homogeneity is not the same as in LCA because the item
means are bounded by the scales used (not by 0 and 1), and the concept of separation can be difficult to assess if item variances
are relatively large.”

solution using median splits was reported as robust to the alternate ‘continuous indicator’ specification
(Weden et al. 2010). Moreover, the authors reported that the “distribution of census tracts across groups
was more skewed with the cluster analysis” using continuous indicators as compared with the
dichotomised approach (Weden et al. 2010, p.44).

Statistical analyses

As expressed, discrete change in neighbourhood types over time was modelled using LTA. A general
description is first provided of LTA followed by the process of model identification. A representative path
diagram for the LTA is depicted in Figure 1-2. Further methods-oriented details are provided in Appendix-A,
these encompassing: the mathematics of LTA, the estimation process involved with LTA, and the
assignment of the units of analysis to latent classes. For completeness, Appendix-A also presents
information on issues not applicable to analyses presented in this paper, namely processes related to
missing data considerations in the schema of mixture models, and approaches to covariate analysis (1-step
compared with 3-step approaches, inclusive of bias-adjustment).
Latent transition analysis models change as transitions in latent states across time; in this study, latent
neighbourhood-levels of social fragmentation across three time points. Change is represented by a
transition probability matrix. Each element of the matrix identifies the probability of transitioning to a
latent state at time t+1 given membership at time t. Change is autoregressive and represented by discrete
movement - state changes - conventionally modelled across consecutive time points through an
autoregressive-1 (AR1) specification, though it is possible to model more complex scenarios, for example
and AR2 model where t3 is regressed on t1 (Collins and Lanza 2010).8

For pragmatic purposes all analyses were restricted to AR1 models.

13

There are systematic, stepwise procedures to guide the conduct of a LTA. Procedurally, this study followed
the recommendations articulated by Collins and Lanza (2010), Masyn (2013), and Nylund (2007).
Furthermore, in the context of exploratory model building, these step-wise processes function to enhance
transparency of model-selection. While step-wise, it is important to note that the identification of latent
class models is also an iterative process, with consideration given as much to the meaningfulness of
enumerated classes as it is to statistical estimates. The following sequential steps were followed: estimate
and examine a k-series of cross-sectional LCA measurement models independently at each of the three
time points so as to identify an optimal (well-fitted) k-class model; using the best-fitting k-class LCA model,
explore estimation of an AR1-LTA model, first imposing measurement invariance across time, and then
freely estimating the LTA model comparing model fit across these two variants;9 finally, explore stationarity
of the propensity for neighbourhoods to transition from one class to another across the two respective
intervals i.e. probability of transitioning between 2001-to-2006 as compared with 2006-to-2011.
1.5.6.1 Model parameters
Latent transition analysis involved the estimation of three sets of parameters. These parameters were: a
vector of dynamic class membership probabilities at Time 1 (δ) that specified the time-specific prevalence
of each class in the population; matrices of transition probabilities (τ), these reflecting the incidence of
neighbourhood-level transitions in social fragmentation from Time 1 to Time 2, and Time 2 to Time 3; and,
a matrix of conditional (class-specific) item-response probabilities for each of the indicators in the
measurement model at each point in time (ρ).10
1.5.6.2 Analytic process: model assessment and selection
Following measurement specification, the process of enumerating a latent class model proceeded by
running a k=1 class solution, then specifying an increasing series of k+1 unconditional models (Collins and
Lanza 2010), with an upper bound of k=9. To enable model assessment, model fit was monitored (Collins
and Lanza 2010). Absolute, overall goodness-of-fit measures, for example the likelihood ratio chi-squared
statistic (G²; G-squared), can be problematic with latent class models, in particular longitudinal applications,
where the contingency table may be demarcated with many sparse cells.11 This sparsity sees the G² statistic
no longer possessive of a theoretical chi-squared distribution (Masyn 2013). Relative fit measures can be

Imposing measurement invariance refers to the process of fixing or constraining the class-specific item-response
probabilities to be equal across time. This serves two purposes. First, the qualitative interpretation, or meaning of the latent
statuses is maintained across time which aids interpretation. Second, estimation is facilitated on the basis of holding the set of
item-response probabilities constant across time. The inverse of imposing measurement invariance is to ‘freely estimate’ the
latent statuses across time by no restricting the estimation of these model parameters (Collins and Lanza 2010).
9

With regards to LTA, within the literature, classes that are identified are often referred to as ‘latent statuses’, or ‘latent
profiles’ so as to distinguish them from the latent classes generated in cross-sectional LC-models.
11 For an LTA model with 9-dichotomous indictors measured at 3-time points there are (2^9)^3 or 2^9*3 = 134,217,728

helpful alternatives, noting though that “even if one model is a far better fit to the data than another, both
could be poor in overall goodness of fit” (Masyn 2013, p.567). But which measures of fit?
Within the literature there is no universal agreement on the set of tests or criteria to apply in order to
guide the identification of a good-fitting latent class measurement model (Nylund et al. 2007, NylundGibson and Masyn 2016). Best practice recommendations are to form judgments derived from multiple
vantages, including: the application of the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT), the Bootstrap
Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT), several information criteria (Bayesian and sample-sized adjusted Bayesian
Information Criteria (BIC and a-BIC), the interpretability and meaningfulness of competing solutions, class
proportions, and entropy (Collins and Lanza 2010, Masyn 2013).
The LMR-LRT and BLRT compare successive latent class models to one another (for example k vs. k+1 class
model). Moreover, both the LMR-LRT and BLRT “provide a p-value which is used to indicate whether a kclass model fits the data statistically significantly better than the k-1 class model” (Nylund-Gibson and
Masyn 2016, p.789).12 Of note, contrary to simulation analyses (Nylund et al. et al 2007), substantive
disparities have been reported in real-world analyses in terms of size of the p-values respectively generated
from the LMR and BLRT (Muthén 2009). In such circumstances advice is to defer to examining the
patterning of the information criteria (Muthén 2009). The BIC and the sample sized adjusted a-BIC describe
parsimony of the model, the smaller the coefficient, the better fitting and more parsimonious the model.
These information criteria were selected based on their performance in simulated mixture model analyses
(Nylund-Gibson and Masyn 2016).
Interpretable latent class typologies are denoted by a classificatory structure that captures the
multidimensional patterning of the construct of interest, as well as differentiating between different types
of members. With regards to the interpretability of competing model solutions, important considerations
are the magnitude of latent class separation and homogeneity; with high levels of both desired (Lubke and
Neale 2006). Latent class separation relates to the manner in which each level of the latent variable
characterises for example, a distinct mixture of social fragmentation. While latent class homogeneity
relates to the unique correspondence between each latent class and the observed indicator items (Collins
and Lanza 2010).

The LMR-LRT uses an analytic approximation for the sampling distribution of the log-likelihood ratio test statistic (Lo Y,
Mendell NR, and Rubin DB (2001). Testing the number of components in a normal mixture. Biometrika 88(3): 767-778.; The
BLRT generates an empirical approximation for the sampling distribution of the log-likelihood ratio test statistic using a
parametric bootstrapping method (McLachlan (1987). On bootstrapping the likelihood ratio test statistic for the number of
components in a normal mixture. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series C (Applied Statistics) 36(3): 318-324.)
12

15

Homogeneity and separation were examined empirically by attending to the values and patterning of the
item-response probabilities, within- and across classes (the ρ-parameters, which within a given class should
exhibit probabilities close to 0 or 1 (Wurpts and Geiser 2014)). Homogeneity and separation were also
considered qualitatively, by asking reflective questions of the nature: Collectively, are the within-class
patterns of item-response probabilities measuring something distinct? And, are the within-class patterns of
the item-response probabilities able to explain distinctions across projected levels of the latent variable?
A further statistic considered to adjudicate a model’s meaningfulness was the estimated time-specific
proportions of each class in the population (the δ-parameters). Candidate models with classes displaying a
relatively low prevalence may be indicative of less than meaningful models, this despite empirical evidence
suggesting they are the best fit to the data. There is no minimum threshold relating to class prevalence
however, models with classes comprising less than 1-5% of the total sample warrant greater scrutiny (Berlin
et al 2014).13
Finally, entropy was also an important concern. In the context of latent class models, entropy relates to the
precision of classification, or the uncertainty of assigning the units of analysis (here, neighbourhoods) to
classes. Assignment was based on the set of subject- or unit-specific posterior probabilities. Posterior
probabilities reflect each subject’s or units’ observed pattern of responses, conditioned by class, and
calculated using an application of Bayes theorem. As true class membership is unknown, there is
classification error (Bolck et al 2004). Uncertainty of classification is high when the set of posterior
probabilities for given units are similar across classes. Classification uncertainty can be measured in a
number of ways. A normalised, scaled version of entropy at the global level (across all classes) was derived
̂ 𝑖𝑐 is the estimated probability that observation 𝑖 is a member of class 𝑐:
using equations-7 and 8, where ∝

[7]

𝑖=1 𝑗=1

and,
𝐸 =1−

𝐸𝑁 (∝)
𝑁 log 𝐽

[8]

In relation to a minimum class prevalence, Frankfurt et al (2016, p.634) cite the guidance provided by Jung & Wickrama
(2008) who “suggested that at least 1% of the total sample should comprise each class; however, this rule depends on the
sample size. For example, in a large sample, 1% may describe hundreds of [neighbourhoods] and thus be a meaningful class.
In a smaller sample, 1% of the sample may be too small to define a class.”
13

16

, with the values for entropy ranging from 0-to-1. As a general guide, entropy values nearer one indicate
improved enumeration accuracy and classification certainty (Celeux and Soromenho 1996). A ‘local’ or
class-specific measure of entropy was also considered by calculating the set of average within-class
posterior probabilities after units (subjects) have been assigned to their most likely class. A local measure of
entropy functions to complement the global entropy metric, and may highlight classes with high levels of
classification uncertainty that are otherwise masked by the global metric. Again, values near one are
indicative of higher classification certainty, with a rule-of-thumb expectation for meaningful models being
they exhibit averages that exceed 0.70 (Nagin 2005).
After initial latent class enumeration, the process shifted to a consideration of the key model assumptions
and restrictions (Nylund-Gibson and Masyn 2016). An integral assumption of latent class models is local
independence. Local independence denotes that within a given class, conditional on the level of the latent
variable, the observed indicators are independent. As multiple indicators (n=9) were applied in this study to
measure social fragmentation, the assumption of local independence may be considered unlikely,
particularly given known processes associated with neighbourhood selection that might have seen people
and households attracted by, and or self-selecting into neighbourhoods (Bruch and Mare 2006, Sampson
and Sharkey 2008).
Local independence was evaluated by inspecting the bivariate residuals between pairs of indicators
(Reboussin et al. 2008). The bivariate residuals are standardized Pearson residuals. In general, the applied
rule of thumb is that any residual larger than 1.96, in absolute terms, is significant where α = 0.05 (Nylund
2007). And, better fitting models are those with few large standardized residuals, and a relative low overall
percentage of significant residuals (not in excess of 5%; Masyn 2013, Nylund 2007).
To examine the transition patterns, the conditional item-response probabilities (matrix of ρ parameters)
were constrained as invariant across all time points. Imposing measurement invariance fixes the nature of
the classes across times, a process that facilitates the interpretation of the transition probabilities.
Imposing measurement invariance also functions to reduce the number of parameters estimated. However,
from a developmental perspective, the assumption of measurement invariance may be unduly restrictive
where there might be reason to perceive time-varying evolution in the latent structure.
As models with different levels of measurement invariance are nested, the applicability of measurement
invariance was assessed using the likelihood-ratio chi-square difference statistic - G2 (diff.) (Lanza and Bray
2010). Concurrently invariance was assessed with reference to the respective set of information criteria
(i.e. AIC, BIC, a-BIC), and the nature of generated latent status profile plots for interpretability and
comparability. The same process of nested model comparison was undertaken to explore the applicability
of stationarity in the transition probabilities (i.e. transition probability invariance) across the two time
periods of change.

17

Graphics, or visualisation, are recommended to complement numeric output and facilitate model
identification and interpretation (meaningfulness). Notably, item response plots were generated to display
the within-class item-response probabilities (ρ parameters), visually summarising the pattern of response
probabilities for each latent class and aided in the consideration of homogeneity. Item response plots were
also considered in the context of examining measurement invariance. As the units of analysis in this study
are neighbourhoods, the geo-visual capacity of ArcGIS was called on to project through chloropleth maps
the spatio-temporal distribution of neighbourhoods modally assigned to categories of social fragmentation.
With regards to model interpretation and identification the utility of this mapping process lies in its
capacity to visually consider the manner in which likely latent class solutions map onto geo-spatial
information characteristic of local neighbourhoods. Furthermore, as a visual language, mapping can induce
relational forms of sensing and understanding (Dovey and Ristic 2017), that can complement the numeric
information generated by latent variable models for the purposes of latent class enumeration.
Latent transition analysis was performed with maximum likelihood estimation, using an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm, and modelled with robust standard errors (MLR). To guard against the
identification local maxima, a minimum of 1000-sets of random start values was computed (Geiser 2013,
Nylund-Gibson and Masyn 2016). In conjunction, 100 of the starting values that yielded the largest log
likelihood values in the first step of the EM-process were specified to carry over into the second step of this
algorithmic optimization (Geiser 2013). The number and proportion of this 100 set of random starting
values that converged to a proper solution were recorded; with the replication of the apparent global
solution across random starting values functioning as a guide to confidence in the identification of the best
or ‘true’ ML solution (Masyn 2013). Where the best ML solution was not readily discernible from the next
best log-likelihood values, competing models were rerun using seeded starting values with consistency of
the latent structures in the various iterations serving to guide decision making (Hipp and Bauer 2006). In
addition, the number of random starts was doubled to n=2000. Syntax for all procedures is provided in
Appendix-B. Significance tests were based on α = 0.05. Relevant coefficients and confidence intervals are
reported for all results (for example fit indices, χ2-diff, p-values, ORs and 95%-CIs). There were no missing
data. Models were estimated with Mplus version 8.0 (Muthén and Muthén 2017).

most of the indicators exhibited fairly modest upward or downward change. Though more substantive

LCA model estimates and fit statistics and plots

Nine LCA models were fitted at each of the three measurement occasions (k=1 through to k=9). These
models were only estimated using information from neighbourhoods which had a minimum dwelling count
of n=35 at each of the three time points (n=371). Table 1-3 presents the estimated log-likelihood values,
the frequency with which models replicated the lowest log-likelihood, and estimates for the model fit
indices across the time varying k-class solutions. Table 1-3 also presents the estimated class proportions,
global and local entropy, frequency of imposed ‘boundary estimates’,14 and programmatic error messages.

A boundary estimate arises where the conditional item-response probability approximates the boundary of the probability
distribution. Here the corresponding logit value is positively or negatively large which in the context of ML-estimation may
14

20

As ‘k’ (the number of classes estimated) was incrementally increased, estimated models took on a more
‘complex structure’. That is classes were generated that had an unequal prevalence. Moreover, as k≥6 the
additional classes that were estimated displayed relatively small proportions (≤ 5%). These smaller classes
were also characterised by conditional item-response probabilities that were less likely to be near the
boundaries of the probability space for all but a few of the nine measurement items; a feature suggestive of
a progressively weaker conditional relationship between these indicators and the modelled latent class.
While, across model iterations, entropy - global and local – was consistently high, generally exceeding 0.90.
However, the frequency with which the lowest log-likelihood value was replicated diminished rapidly as the
number of classes estimated exceeded six. Furthermore, the frequency with which the modelling program
‘stepped in’ to fix boundary estimates to enable model identification also steadily increased where k>5.
In terms of the information criteria, across time the BIC consistently pointed towards a four class solution.
While, the AIC and aBIC were variously suggestive of a seven and an eight class model. A series of scree
plots examining the respective profiles of the AIC, BIC and aBIC estimates generated at each time point for
k=1 through to k=9 models is presented in Figure 1-3. As is evident, as the number of estimated classes was
increased beyond five, declines in the AIC and aBIC became relatively marginal. LMR and BLRT comparative
tests between incrementally increasing k and k+1 solutions also presented discordant though somewhat
unstable perspectives (Table 1-4). Notably, the BLRT tests failed to rule out larger models until k=8,
whereas the LMR tests suggestively pointed towards both smaller, and larger models; these varying
depending on the time period under question.
Collectively, a picture emerged suggesting an appropriate model solution was in the range from k=4 to k=6.
To further study these prospective solutions, conditional item-response probability plots were generated
for k=4, 5, and 6 solutions that were freely estimated within and across time (Appendix-D). A series of
corresponding chloropleth maps were also produced by ‘hard classifying’15 neighbourhoods at each time
point through modal assignment into social fragmentation classes for k=4, 5 and 6 solutions (Appendix-E).
Inspection of the conditional item-response plots from the competing k=4, 5 and 6 solutions afforded a
number of insights, namely: the four classes identified in the k=4 solutions were relatively stable; both as kincreased, and across time; the additional classes which were modelled i.e. the fifth and sixth classes,
appeared to be adequately differentiated from each other, as well as from the other four classes; and, they
also featured potentially unique differences in the nature of their within class item-response patterns (i.e.

cause singularity of the information matrix. To avoid this scenario, modelling programs such as Mplus fix such estimates. A
high frequency of imposed ‘boundary estimates’ may be a sign of a local maximum and or of model overfit (Geiser 2013).
In general, for each unit of analysis in an LCA and or LTA model, there is a non-zero posterior probability of membership
(assignment) into each of the estimated k-classes (or, latent statuses). Moreover, these posterior probabilities sum to one
across the k-classes (or, latent statuses). Units of analysis can be assigned to classes based on the highest, or modal value, of
their respective estimated posterior probabilities; a process referred to as ‘hard classification or partitioning’. Alternatively, a
form of soft partitioning might be applied based, for example, on proportional assignment into each of the k-class where the
set of posterior probabilities are applied as weights in prospective classify-analyse analyses (Bakk et al. 2014).

they displayed moderate-to-high class homogeneity). Spatially, the assessment of whether an additional
fifth, or fifth and sixth class, augmented any final solution was hampered by the relatively low prevalence of
these two classes. Visually, though it appeared that neighbourhoods assigned to these two classes occupied
territory at the margins of the space populated by the four classes modelled in the k=4 solution. While this
observation potentially may have been indicative of meaningful ‘boundary’ or transitory classes; it might
also have been an artefact of the low prevalence of these classes.
Considered overall, and ceding that the BIC often tends to underfit models (Dziak et al. 2019), a four-class
LCA model was selected to carry forward into the LTA. With regards to the modelled four classes of social
fragmentation, these were labelled as: ‘low’ (class-A; reference class in analyses), ‘mixed-level inner urban’
(class-B), ‘mixed-level peri-urban’ (class-C), and ‘high’ social fragmentation (class-D). Coarse-grained labels
were applied to avoid the reification of categorical labels, as well as to avoid mischaracterising the classes
as immutable. Labelling was however based on the patterning of the conditional item-response
probabilities (Figure 1-4), and the spatial patterning of neighbourhoods to assigned classes (Figure 1-5).
From a measurement perspective classes-A and -D were orthogonal to each other, being respectively
characterised by the lowest and highest levels of social fragmentation across all three dimensions.
Neighbourhoods modally assigned to classes-A and -D also differed in their spatial distribution; the former
being prominent among the middle-to-outer ring of metropolitan suburbs, while the latter were more likely
to be represented within the inner ring of suburbs. Quantitatively, classes-B and -C were also relatively
orthogonal to one another, but they differed to classes-A and -D through their propensity to not reflect all
nine measurement items at the polarities of the modelled probability distributions of these indicators.
Moreover, classes-B and -C were variegated in the manner in which they respectively reflected the
dimension of ‘attachment’. Namely, class-B suburbs exhibited a greater propensity to harbour longer term
residents but also unconventional and single-person household types. The opposite was the case for class-C
suburbs. And, spatially, while some neighbourhoods assigned to class-C were represented within the inner
and middle ring of suburbs (not dissimilar to the spatial distribution of class-D suburbs), class-C suburbs
were more likely to be located at the peri-urban fringe. In terms of their prevalence, neighbourhoods
assigned to classes-A and -D were the most prevalent at each measurement occasion (estimated timevarying prevalence estimates respectively ranged from 44% (2001) to 35% (2011), and 31% (2001) to 35%
(2011). While, neighbourhoods assigned to classes-B and -C were the least represented; their prevalence
estimates respectively ranged from some 14% (2001) to 12% in 2011, and 12% (2001) to 17% (2011).

LTA Model

Following the identification of the k=4 LC-model, analysis proceeded to the longitudinal setting where
social fragmentation was synchronously examined across all three time points using the framework of LTA.
LTA was also used to estimate the incidence of transitions in social fragmentation latent class membership
from Time-1 to Time-2, and Time-2 to Time-3. As part of this process the assumption of invariance was
explored by: formal tested using a nested likelihood-ratio test (i.e. G2-test); examining the information
criteria across the nested models; and, inspecting the form and nature of the latent status profile plots
from the freely estimated, non-invariant model.
With regards to the nested comparison (Table 1-5), the G2-test favoured a non-invariant model. However,
inspection of the BIC and a-BIC values favoured measurement invariance. In addition, a visual examination
of the time varying item-response profile plots from the freely estimated LTA model (Figure 1-6) did not
substantively make the case for non-invariance. Considering all of this information, a decision was
therefore made to impose measurement invariance across time, a facet ensured the qualitative
interpretation, or meaning of the latent statuses was maintained across time aided interpretation.

With regards to the assumption of stationarity (i.e. if the propensity for neighbourhoods to transition into
differing classes from Time-1 to Time-2 was analogous to that from Time-2 to Time-3), a nested model
imposing stationary transition probabilities was compared to the measurement invariant model. Here again
(Table 1-6) the G2-test and information criteria pointed in differing directions, with the former favouring the
imposition of stationarity, while the later did not. And, while there distinct similarities between the two
transition matrices estimated from the non-stationary model (Figure 1-7), there were also substantive
probabilities on the off-diagonals, suggesting different transition patterns were likely at play across the two
intervals; a factor that fed into the determination to progress with a non-stationary LTA model.

Proportions for the most likely membership in the four latent class statuses at each of the measurement
occasions are presented in Table 1-7. And, the two transition matrices (2001-to-2006, and 2006-to-2011)
for the 4-class LTA model are presented in Figure 1-7. Stasis was a feature, with most neighbourhoods
remaining in the same latent status across time. Moreover, relative to classes-A and -D, neighbourhoods
assigned to classes-B, and -C exhibited a higher incidence of transitioning to another class, in particular for
the interval spanning 2006-to-2011. And, where the model was suggestive that neighbourhoods
transitioned into another class across time, neighbourhoods predominantly shifted from class-B and -C into
classes A and D.

Discussion

This study applied a multivariate finite mixture model to characterise neighbourhoods, and their evolution,
with respect to social fragmentation. Four types of neighbourhoods were probabilistically identified, each
defined by features reflecting distinct multidimensional combinations of attributes associated with the
`how', the `who', and the `why' of fragmenting social conditions. The social topography implied by these
four neighbourhood types was not stagnant across the ten-year window of analysis, with a non-trivial
percentage of neighbourhoods inferred to transition to another class over time. Many neighbourhoods
though exhibited substantive intransience, with neighbourhoods assigned as class-A types (low social
fragmentation) observed to have the greatest ‘stickiness’ of character.
The intransience of social fragmentation identified in this study mirrors the persistence of this trait evident
in the other known study that has explored the spatial and temporal dynamics of social fragmentation at
the small-area level. Grigoroglou et al. (2019) examined social fragmentation across England, and its 10
administrative regions, from 2001 to 2011, through the decennial Censuses using Congdon’s (1996) four
indicators (percentage of: single people, one-person households, private renting, and population turnover).
The central finding of Grigoroglou et al. (2019, p.1 of 8) was the “strong persistence for social
fragmentation nationally (Spearman’s r=0.93).” The authors also observed increased spatial clustering over
time, though the reported levels of clustering remained low (Moran’s I = 0.0483 (2001), 0.0794 (2011)).
To date, the spatial and temporal dynamics of social fragmentation have received less attention than other
social traits of the environment, notably social and material deprivation (Grigoroglou et al. 2019). This
study addressed this gap. More broadly, this study addressed the identified need for “longitudinal studies
of neighbourhood temporal dynamics” and, the study of “how neighbourhood processes evolve over time”
(Sampson et al 2002, p.472).
Study findings have a number of implications. First, these results highlight the utility of LTA as a modelbased approach for classifying and categorising urban neighbourhoods with regards to traits that are
consequential for social life. Neighbourhood-centred applications of LTA do not though need to be
restricted to an assessment of social factors; they may also be extended to consider other multidimensional
arrays of neighbourhood-level attributes, be they related to the social, built and or natural environment.
Second, while, the study highlighted that the social nature of neighbourhoods can change over relatively
short-to-moderate time periods, it also highlighted that many neighbourhoods do not change in character;
a propensity that has been previously noted of social fragmentation (Grigoroglou et al. 2019), as well as of
other traits for example neighbourhood quality of life (Delmelle and Thill 2014). However, as Galster et al.
(2007, p.179) remarks, this observation does not imply “that neighbourhoods have so much inertia that
they cannot be altered significantly from their stable state.” Rather it suggests that time matters. From a
policy orientation them the implication is that where there might be an intention to act in a targeted

30

manner on the social fabric of a neighbourhood “short-term, policy-induced ‘quick fixes’ hold little prospect
to alter longer-term outcomes for neighbourhoods; sustained effort is required” (Galster et al 2007, p.179).
Findings also underscore the importance of policy actions that account for relational dependencies among
neighbourhoods. Ostensibly this inference for policy would see groups of neighbourhoods leveraged, and
their collective assets brought to bear in efforts aimed at fostering social integration in focal areas.
In highlighting policy implications there is also a need to express some caution; in particular where policy
may entertain ‘social mixing’ as a means to act on social fragmentation. Social mix is a nebulous concept,
but one which variously relates to the socioeconomic or housing tenure profile, within a locality. Its
relevance here is that social mix has often been touted as a means to foster social inclusion and build
cohesive communities (Arthurson et al. 2015). However, as Arthurson et al. (2015) argues, and Lees (2008,
p.2449), cogently expresses, any “policies of social mixing require critical attention with regard to their
ability to produce an inclusive urban renaissance and the potentially detrimental gentrifying effects they
may inflict.”
In terms of strengths, this study did not assume that neighbourhoods change in a homogenous manner.
Rather neighbourhood evolution was modelled as a heterogeneous process, with neighbourhoods
operationalised as multidimensional ecological units. In a similar vein, there was no a priori assumption of
spatial dependence in the heterogeneity of neighbourhood-level social fragmentation. Rather, the applied
latent class models allowed for the identification of dynamic profiles of neighbourhood-level social
fragmentation irrespective of where they were located across the city’s spatial territory.
Further strengths relate to measurement. Latent class modelling of social fragmentation was based on a set
of nine census-based indicators. Spielman and Singleton (2015, p.1007) have argued that the variance
associated with a single estimate of a census-based indicator is “a symmetrically distributed random
variable”. Moreover, as “variable-specific estimates are partially independent from each other, when
looking at a sufficiently large collection of these variables, these random ‘errors’ will average to zero”; a
feature that enables the applied multivariate approach in this study to “provide a more robust picture of
the place[s] under investigation” (Spielman and Singleton 2015, p.1007).
In a related manner, Smith (2011, p.537) notes that “Chance events…are averaged out at the group
level...Further, the basic notion that what is near-random at one level may be almost entirely predictable at
a higher level is an emergent property of many systems, from particle physics to the social sciences”. It is a
perspective that draws attention not only to the distinctiveness of the information gained by studying
latent constructs, but also the utility of examining concepts at an ecological, or neighbourhood-level, as
compared to a variable- or individual-level.
In considering the findings and interpretations of this study some care is required as there are a number of
limitations that warrant attention; these are variously outlined and discussed below.

31

1.7.1

Limitations

This was a descriptive analysis of the multidimensional and developmental profile of neighbourhood-level
social fragmentation. It did not set out to causally explain the estimated model. To this end a limitation is
an analysis, and discussion, of the ‘why’ neighbourhoods evolved as they were estimated. The LTA
framework is flexible and readily accommodates the capacity to model structural antecedents; both as
predictors of estimated latent states at given time points, as well as predictors of transitions across time
periods. Modelling of this kind is by its nature substantively more complicated and susceptible to difficulties
with regards to model identification and estimation, more so where sample size is at the lower bounds of
what is advised for unconditional latent transition models (an n in the range of 300-500 units).
With regards to sample size, a primary limitation relates to statistical power. Considerations relating to
statistical power are very much at the forefront of methodological development in LC-applications (Baldwin
2015, Tien et al. 2013, Wurpts and Geiser 2014). Generally speaking, in LC-models there may be concerns
regarding the reliability of the parameter estimates and standard errors when for example, sample size is
small, and or if one or more of the latent classes exhibits an unusually low prevalence (Nylund-Gibson and
Masyn 2016). For LC-models, a small sample is often expressed as an n below 300, a number that
approximates the sample size in this study. However, there are many examples of meaningful
neighbourhood-centred applications of LCA that have been conducted with relatively small samples.
Moreover, in this study latent constructs were modelled using a moderate-to-high quality set of observed
indicators, with generally good evidence of within class homogeneity and across class separation; qualities
noted to enhance statistical power within latent class and transition analyses in the face of relatively small
samples (Baldwin 2015, Tien et al 2013, Wurpts and Geiser 2014).
Latent class models are recognised to be dependent on the underlying sample characteristics and the
observed unit-level response patterns. The corollary of these facets is that latent class and mixture models
trade-off generalisability for specificity. Certainly then there needs to be recognition that although a
neighbourhood-centred application of LTA can provide insight into neighbourhood-level developmental
processes it remains an inductive and exploratory modelling approach.
It was also understood that the provenance of the set of latent class indicators used to measure
neighbourhood social fragmentation may have impacted findings (these indicators were derived by Ivory et
al. (2012) through the use of New Zealand population-level data). Concern relating to the context-specific
applicability of these indicators might have been attenuated had, for example, a principal components
analysis been untaken a priori. Of relevance though, through a series of experiments investigating the
attributes of LCA, Cole et al. (2017) demonstrated the sensitivity of the within-class item-response
probabilities to variations in the measurement properties of the underlying construct of interest. To this
end Cole et al. (2017, p.177) advocated that researchers applying LC-models ascertain whether their

32

identified class structure(s) were “replicable across minor perturbations of measurement”. Such an exercise
was undertaken within this study with the indicator set added to, subtracted from, and altered.16
Another limitation was that social fragmentation was not directly measured. Ivory (2008, p.132) noted that
“It would be hazardous to inflate [an indirect instrument] to be a complete measure of such a
neighbourhood’s fragmenting characteristics, and even more unfortunate to assume it is a [direct] measure
of the social cohesion or capital in the neighbourhood. Its use in analyses should reflect these inherent
limits.” In a related manner this study did not add to the debate concerned with social selection and social
causation as competing hypotheses related to neighbourhood change.
The identified typology, and set of identified transitions, are likely subject to the imposed temporal scale –
two five-year intervals. Time-scale dependence in the nature of a neighbourhood’s character is consonant
with the temporal aspects of the ‘uncertain geographic context problem’ articulated by Kwan (2012), and
the ‘modifiable spatiotemporal unit problem’ expressed by Martin et al. (2015); itself an extension of
Openshaw’s (1984) ‘modifiable areal unit problem’. Indeed, the temporal aspect of the ‘uncertain
geographic context problem’ is an issue tangibly highlighted by Le Roux et al. (2017) in a Paris situated
study, which over the course of a 24-hour period observed marked cyclical spatiotemporal variability in
district-level social composition and social segregation; an observation that likely holds implications
regarding the patterning and evolution of neighbourhood-level social fragmentation.
The temporal spacing of the observed neighbourhood-level measures at equidistant 5-year increments may
also have induced temporal misclassification (Collins and Lanza 2010). The extent of such temporal
misclassification would be a reflection of the speed at which neighbourhoods change relative to the
temporal design features of the study (Collins 2006). However, given measurement intervals in this study
were aligned with Census years it cannot be certain that neighbourhood transitions were underestimated,
or indeed neighbourhood stability overestimated. Furthermore, the nature of discrete change profiles
generated by FMM, such as LTA, may be sensitive to the number of encompassed time-points (Jackson and
Sher 2006). Though as Collins and Lanza (2010) note, the interpretation of transition probabilities should
always be relative to the model, and any inferences beyond this should be made with caution.
There was a discrepancy between the boundaries of Gazetted Localities (SSCs) and ABS supported SSCs. For
example, in 2011 SSCs were derived on the basis of whole SA1s whereas the official gazetted suburban
boundary applied different criteria (variously land parcel boundaries, natural geographic cleavages etc.).
Moreover, with the genesis of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) (a classification which

In preliminary analyses (not reported here), LCA models were variously estimated using two versions of the Language
spoken indicator: “Main language spoken at Home if not English” and “Proficiency of English language”. In addition, models
were estimated with a ‘Social Housing’ Indicator in two different flavours, with and without the ‘Home Ownership’ indicator
in the model. Furthermore, models were estimated with and without either of the ‘Same Usual Residence x1 / x5-year’
indicators in the model. Analyses available on request.

supplanted the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC)), SA1s replaced CDs as the base unit
geographies. Arguably, these boundary and methodological changes may have induced non-differential
misclassification bias (Blakely and Woodward 2000). However, it is unclear what influence non-differential
misclassification bias would have had on the formation of the latent class models.
Neighbourhoods included in these analyses were operationalised through the SSC. This specification (and
restriction) brings to the fore the spatial aspects of the aforementioned modifiable areal unit (Openshaw
1984), as well as uncertain geographic context problem (Kwan 2012) and, their respective implications for
inference. For example, Browning et al. (2017, p.227) observed that the pattern of social integration and
segregation may co-vary not only on the basis of residential factors, but may conditionally extend to the
“activity locations neighbourhood residents frequent in the course of their daily routines.”
At the heart of this study is classification and categorisation. Curran and Bauer (2016, para.1) point toward
a tension where “Extracting categories when variation is really continuous presents risks, but so too does
failing to identify meaningfully distinct subgroups”. Categories may quieten noisy information, and order a
messy world. But as Vanderbilt (2016, para.7) notes, this “categorical perception…is not an innocent
process”. Moreover, Vanderbilt (2016, para.8) argues that although “Similarity serves as a basis for the
classification of objects”, similarities may be perceptual artefacts of the imposed classificatory system. And,
relatedly “Things we might have viewed as more similar become, when placed into distinct categories,
more different.” For Vanderbilt (2016, para.22), the corollary of this dependence “on categorising, is that
we could miss something outside our perception”. And, that while grappling with complex information may
induce cognitive disfluency (Owen et al. 2016), it might function to prompt deeper and more thoughtful
engagement (Alter 2013) which might be nullified through the simplifying effect of categorisation. An offset
to these perspectives is that in the context of this study the latent typology was identified through an
inductive model-based process.
This study also applied median splits to the latent class indicators. The case against median splits is wellknown, particularly for applications that might otherwise see continuous independent variables analysed
using linear models. Central arguments related to median splits include the loss of information concerning
intra-subject differences, loss of statistical power, and the induction of spurious statistical relationships
(MacCallum et al. 2002). Indeed the totality of these issues led MacCallum et al. (2002, p.19) to state that
“dichotomization is rarely defensible and often will yield misleading results”. However, in a series of papers,
based on a simulation analysis, Iacobucci et al. (2015a, 2015b) defended the use of median splits, in
particular for analyses where a set of independent variables are uncorrelated; a condition that features as
one of the fundamental assumptions of latent class models, and which was an assumption that was met in
this study. There are also recent findings from LC-specific simulation analyses, albeit involving latent classes
reflective of count-based indicators, that median split dichotomisation may not affect the quality of mixture

34

recovery, or bias associated parameter estimates, particularly in circumstances where the number of
estimated classes exceeds the number of indicators (Macia and Wickham 2018).
Putting aside the respective arguments of Iacobucci et al. (2015b), Macia and Wickham (2018), and
MacCallum et al. (2002), what of the categorical alternatives to applying median splits in this study? For
example, Gelman and Park (2008) advanced a case for trichotomising variables. However, trichotomising
nine indicators in an LTA, measured across three-time points, would have seen the possible response
pattern expand from 2^27 to 3^27, a likely unsustainable increase.
Finally, neighbourhoods were assigned to latent statuses based on their highest posterior probabilities of
membership; a factor that did not account for the uncertainty in latent membership. The issue of
uncertainty and classification error in both cross-sectional and longitudinal variants of latent class models is
a function of the identification of a well-defined and meaningful model that innately suppresses
classification error and assignment uncertainty. Moreover, given the high classification quality of the LCA
and LTA models (entropy exceeding 0.90), classification error that may have been introduced could be
surmised to have been small. In addition, analyses presented in this paper were descriptive in nature.
1.7.2

Future research

By drawing on, and extending the theoretical and methodological approach adopted in this study, there are
a number of areas of enquiry that might be pursued to strengthen understandings of neighbourhood-level
social fragmentation; a number of these are outlined below.
Arguably, cities and their neighbourhoods are products of historic and ongoing socio-political processes. Or,
as Piiparinan (2017, para.15) remarks “It’s on the inside: in our fears, and inside the systems that
simultaneously placate and preen them” that “Power and politics make places, not the other way around.”
To this end, if neighbourhoods are both products of power and politics, as well as producers of social
patterns, then there is need to more actively engage with these factors. A fuller understanding of the
manner by which socio-political processes shape the topography and dynamics of social fragmentation
might be gained by drawing on critical theory to complement analytic enquiries. As a critical theory,
political ecology, in particular, is germane to the study of neighbourhoods, and neighbourhood evolution,
as it addresses the impacts of structural factors such as power, race, and class (Chitewere et al. 2017).
Political ecology has its roots in political economy (the examination of the unequal distribution of power
and wealth in a society), and cultural ecology (the analysis of people, their way of life and their physical
environment) (Chitewere et al. 2017). Political ecology is also tied to the theories of environmental and
social justice. With equity in mind, using political ecology to question why neighbourhood types are, and
how they came to be and the manner by which they morph, might unlock insights into the non-random
distribution of neighbourhood types, the manner in which neighbourhood types are differentially

35

experienced by populations (for whom), and the likely mode of action requisite to addressing the just
nature of the social conditions of living.
As expressed, a lifecourse perspective affords a framework to study and understand neighbourhoods and
neighbourhood dynamics. Fundamental factors in the lifecourse approach are: age, time (or period), and
cohort year. Conjointly bringing these three factors to bear in an analysis would offer a unique way of
examining competing, intersecting and or coalescent influences on the evolution of social contexts. For
example, in a neighbourhood-centred typological analysis, age effects might be viewed as those tied to a
neighbourhood’s chronological development; while, period effects might reflect time-limited macro-social
influences (such as fluxes in economic and housing market circumstances); with, cohort effects construed
to reflect neighbourhood-traits such as the prevailing design-type or spatial syntax. Relational factors are
also a feature of a lifecourse-of-place perspective. To that end the flexibility of the LTA framework could be
applied to model and examine the effects of relational antecedents. For example, modelling the effects of
adjacent neighbourhoods’ social fragmentation status on the development of focal areas. Or, considering
how a neighbourhood’s social fragmentation status changes over time as a function of its structural
relationship to social services and resources valued by its residents (Livingston et al. 2013).
A third research direction to strengthen understanding of neighbourhood dynamics is to investigate the
interaction of exogenous factors with endogenous processes. As Galster et al. (2007) noted, beyond the
classic work of Thomas Schelling, an economist who examined the spatial dynamics of race, there has been
limited empirical analysis of a neighbourhood’s internal processes that might see it shift in one direction or
another after it has been perturbed from equilibrium or, that function as self-correcting mechanisms to
stabilise it in the face of a shock. A promising approach to the study of endogenous stability at the
neighbourhood-level is to integrate methods such as LTA with a complex systems model such as cellular
automata. Indeed, there is an applied history of integrating Markov models and Cellular Automata, though
most extant applications have focused on land use (Ghosh et al. 2017). Simulation models such as cellular
automata additionally provide a platform for synthetic experimentation, a functionality that affords a test
bed for examining a range of thought experiments, mechanisms and policy interventions.

1.8

Conclusion

In conclusion, in this spatio-temporal analysis four neighbourhood types were identified that variously
reflected diverse dimensional profiles of social fragmentation, giving rise to a variegated metropolitan
social topography. While certain neighbourhoods were inferred to have changed type across time, with
modelled shifts in the nature of their fragmenting profile, most neighbourhoods were characterised by
intransience. And, although analyses are exploratory and descriptive, collectively the insights into
neighbourhood change and the developmental evolution of social fragmentation may be relevant for
framing actions that aim to impact the social fabric at the neighbourhood level.

LTA: Extended methods

Mathematical model
Mathematically, the LTA model is expressed as per equation-C1:17
𝑆

𝑆

𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 (𝑌 = 𝑦) = ∑ ∑ 𝛿𝑝 𝜌𝑖′ |𝑝 𝜌𝑗′ |𝑝 𝜌𝑘′ |𝑝 𝜌𝑖′′ |𝑝 𝜌𝑗′′ |𝑝 𝜌𝑘 ′′ |𝑝 𝜏𝑞|𝑝

[C1]

𝑝=1 𝑞=1

where, Y equals the proportion of units generating a particular response y, and t = 1st time of measurement,
t + 1 = 2nd time of measurement, i’-i’’=response categories 1, 2… I for 1st indicator, j’-j’’= response
categories 1, 2… J for 2nd indicator, k’-k’’= response categories 1, 2… K for 3rd indicator, i’,j’,k’= responses
obtained at time t, i’’,j’’,k;’’= responses obtained at time t + 1, p = latent status at time t and q = latent
status at time t + 1.
Estimation process
LTA is undertaken with maximum likelihood estimation. During this process, for each model run,
parameter values are estimated through an iterative process using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation
with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Do and Batzoglou 2008). The expectation-maximization
algorithm iterates between an ‘E-step’, that aims at “guessing a probability distribution over completions of
missing data [the latent or hidden variable] given the current model”, and an ‘M-step’ “re-estimating the
model parameters using these completions” to maximise the expected log-likelihood of the data found in
the ‘E-step’ (Do and Batzoglou 2008, p.898). However, difficulties with likelihood surfaces can hamper the
identification of latent class models (Masyn 2013). These difficulties, encompassing multiple local maxima
and flattish saddle points, complicate the identification of a global maximum likelihood (ML) solution.
Models with few parameter restrictions can be more prone to likelihood functions characterised by
multiple modes. The tenability of model identification will therefore be a consideration when attention
turns to specifying the form of measurement invariance in the LTA model.
Model identification can though be assisted by applying multiple sets of random starting values for the
iterative estimation algorithm (Hipp and Bauer 2006); this permitting a denser search of the likelihood
parameter space and an enhanced prospect of identifying the global maxima (highest likelihood).
Recommendations are to specify a minimum of 100-to-500 sets of random start values for complex models
(Geiser 2013, Nylund-Gibson and Masyn 2016). In conjunction, a proportional number of the starting values
(for example, 10%) that yield the largest log likelihood values in the first step should be carried over into
the second step of the algorithmic optimization process (Geiser 2013). It is also recommended to record the

number and proportion of sets of random starting values that converge to a proper solution; with a high
frequency of replication of the apparent global solution across random starting values functioning to
strengthen confidence in the identification of the best or ‘true’ ML solution (Masyn 2013). In circumstances
where the best ML solution is not readily discernible from the next best log-likelihood values, the advice is
to rerun these competing models using seeded starting values with consistency of the latent structures in
the various iterations serving to guide decision making (Hipp and Bauer 2006).
Missing data and its management: FIML and MI
Missing data on the repeated measures can be a feature of longitudinal studies yielding unbalanced panels.
And, it is the case here, in this study, where data are missing for certain neighbourhoods on indicators
measuring social fragmentation across modelled time-points.18 Rubin (1976) defines data as missing at
random (MAR) if the missing data pattern can be explained by observed measures and their values in the
data set, and not on unobserved and unaccounted for measures or the values of the missing data
themselves. Given the variables in this study (both the observed set of indicators measuring social
fragmentation, and the covariates), MAR is a reasonable assumption. A corollary of the MAR assumption is
that the missing data mechanism is ignorable. An ignorable missing data mechanism is important as it is an
assumption of a number of model-based approaches able to accommodate missing data (Dong and Peng
2013).
Missing data introduce potential bias in parameter estimation and weaken the generalisability of the
results (Dong and Peng 2013). And simply ignoring cases with missing data, for example through listwise
deletion and complete case analysis, leads to information loss, decreased statistical power and increased
standard errors (Little 1992). Model-based approaches to missing data are able to yield less biased
estimates than simpler conventional missing data processes, for example available case analysis, singlevalue mean imputation, or last-value carried forward, unless the data are missing completely at random
(MCAR), a stronger assumption than MAR (Dong and Peng 2013).
Two model-based approaches for missing data are multiple (saturated multivariate normal) imputation
(MI), and full information maximum likelihood estimation using the iterative expectation-maximization
algorithm (FIML-EM). Within the context of mixture models, and their direct applications,
recommendations have wavered as to which of these missing data approaches to apply. For example
Asparouhov and Muthén (2010) endorsed the use of MI, however, Enders and Gottschall (2011) expressed
concern that the use of MI in a mixture model might differentially impact the estimates of covariate effects
across latent classes.

18

In this study, there are no missing data for the neighbourhood-level predictors.

46

To date, recommendations related to the use of MI or FIML in mixture models have not considered the
consequences of the missing data approach on class enumeration. Sterba (2016) aimed to redress this
issue. Via a simulation study, the comparative model fit of a categorical latent variable, within a crosssectional context, was examined under alternative missing data approaches, including MI and FIML. Sterba
(2016, p.171) observed that MI was predisposed to reducing nonnormality, a characteristic that made it
difficult to identify and recover unobserved heterogeneity, particularly “under the conditions of moderate
class separation and large missingness proportions”. Importantly, Sterba (2016, p.172) concluded that
“results should generalize to the parallel context of discriminating continuous versus categorical variability
in change”.
Covariate analysis: One- and Three-step Approaches
Applications of latent class models, such as LTA, aim to ascertain a typology based on unidentified
population-level heterogeneity. They can also aim to assess relationships between the modelled typology
and auxiliary variables (i.e. covariates - antecedents or predictors – and, distal outcomes).19 With regards to
this latter aim, two distinct approaches to covariate analysis have been advanced. The first method is a
single-step approach in which covariates are directly incorporated into the latent class model. The second
is a three-step approach. In a three-step approach: the latent class model is specified and enumerated
(step-1; unconditional model), units of analysis are assigned to latent classes based on their posterior class
probabilities (step-2), and associations between assigned class membership and auxiliary variables
examined, in general through the specification of a multinomial logistic regression, where the latent classes
are configured as categories of a now observed outcome (step-3).20
The substantive difference between one- and three-step approaches relates to timing, and the matter of
when covariate analysis is undertaken: during (one-step) or after (three-step) latent class enumeration.
Proponents of a single-step approach assert this method yields more precise and less biased estimates of
covariate effects. The basis for this assertion is that as the latent classes are enumerated jointly with the
covariates this full model encompasses the most information as the covariates assist to define each class.
Moreover, as a single-step approach naturally maintains the uncertainty of latent class membership within
the model, conserving this probabilistic information enables the regression estimates to be modelled with
classification error, a factor that can guard against any biasing of the standard errors (Clark and Muthén
2009). Equally, the single-step approach has a number of reported disadvantages. For example, the
introduction of covariates directly into a latent class model can adversely impact model fit. In addition, the
estimated measurement model can itself “shift in nontrivial ways with regards to the class-specific

In this study (and dissertation), analyses are restricted to the former type of auxiliary variables - covariates - as
antecedents or predictors of the latent variables.
20 Associations can also be examined descriptively using cross-tabulations; two-way tables summarising the class
membership probabilities per covariate category. If this descriptive process is enacted with proportional assignment, this
yields Magidson and Vermunt’s (2001) ‘inactive covariates’ method.

parameter estimates, adjusted class proportions, or even the number of classes, resulting in substantive
alterations in the meaning and interpretation of the carefully constructed latent classes from the
unconditional model” (Nylund-Gibson and Masyn 2016, p.783).
Shifts in the nature of the model on account of the covariates may cause concern regarding the veracity of
the latent classes, as well as promote inferential uncertainty. To provide recommendations as to when to
include covariates in the modelling process, Nylund-Gibson and Masyn (2016) conducted an expansive set
of Monte Carlo simulations examining the influence of covariates on class enumeration. Simulations were
based on latent class models with dichotomous indicators, with a range of scenarios modelled where: class
frequencies (number of classes), class proportions, and sample sizes were varied. The unequivocal finding
of this study was that class enumeration is most reliably undertaken in an unconditional model, and least
reliable when specified through a conditional model which encompasses only an indirect path from the
covariate to the observed set of indicators through the latent class (i.e. a normative one-step approach).
This finding was robust, with one caveat; the enumeration of an unconditional model where the
assumption of conditional independence was violated on account of omitting direct effects from the
covariate to the latent class indicators, a situation that conferred an elevated risk of the over-extraction of
classes, and was likely to induce bias (Nylund-Gibson and Masyn 2016).
With regards to covariate analysis, Nylund-Gibson and Masyn’s (2016) study highlighted not only when
covariates should be introduced into the model process, but also how. In a latent class model covariates
may influence not only the latent class variable, but also the observed latent class indicators. Such
influences may be transmitted through an indirect pathway, via the latent class variable. They may also be
more direct, conveyed through a pathway from the covariates to the indicators that bypasses the latent
class variable. However, an assumption of latent class models is that the observed indicators are
conditionally, or locally, independent. Omitting to specify any direct relationship between the covariates
and the indicators, when there is such relationship in the population, would violate this conditional
independence assumption. Moreover, as Nylund-Gibson and Masyn (2016) noted, ignoring any direct
covariate effects on the indicators would impact the reliability of class enumeration in a three-step
approach.
Nylund-Gibson and Masyn’s (2016, p.795) conclusion that “Latent class enumeration can and should be
done without covariates” is supported by a second simulation study undertaken by Kim et al (2016), with
these researchers also finding that class enumeration was robust to the exclusion of covariates from the
model. Kim et al (2016) also substantiated Nylund-Gibson and Masyn’s (2016) recommendation to
systematically examine direct (class-varying or class-invariant)21 effects on the class indicators once the
Covariates may directly affect all or some of the observed latent class indicators. Nylund-Gibson and Masyn (2016) refer to
the former case as a class-invariant direct effect, and the latter case as a class-varying direct effect. Class-varying direct effects
may also be referred to as ‘differential item functioning’ (DIF); see for example, Nylund (2007, pp92-93). In a neighbourhood21

covariates were modelled as predictors of class membership. In addition, though the simulation studies by
Kim et al (2016) and Nylund-Gibson and Masyn (2016) were cross-sectional in nature, their principal
findings regarding when and how to undertake class enumeration in the context of covariate regression,
was considered to generalise to longitudinal applications.
Assignment of subjects to latent classes
An important component of the three-step ‘classify-analyse’ approach is the assignment of units (subjects;
neighbourhoods) to a level of the latent class variable. Given a model, assignment is based on the
estimated posterior probabilities, derived for each unit using Bayes theorem, and conditioned on the unit’s
pattern of responses (Bray et al 2015).
In general, there are three forms of assignment: modal, pseudo-random draw, and proportional. In modal,
or maximum-probability assignment, units are assigned to the class for which they have the highest
estimated posterior probability of membership (Goodman 2007). Once a unit is classified to the latent class
with the highest posterior probability, its probability of being in that assigned class is one, and zero for all
other classes. As such, modal assignment ‘hard partitions’ or crisply assigns units to classes.
Assignment with multiple pseudo-class random draws is also a form of hard partitioning (Vermunt 2010),
though it aims to take account of potential membership in the array of estimated classes (Bolck et al 2004).
In this approach, assignment is made by randomly sampling from the multinomial distribution of posterior
probabilities. “By having multiple random samples, [units] are given a chance to flip into neighbouring
classes, which gives a sense of the variation associated with the distribution” (Clark and Muthén 2009,
p.12). However, unit assignment to a latent class still remains as an all or none proposition. That is assigned
probabilities will be ‘one’ for the randomly drawn class, and ‘zero’ for all other classes, with regression
analyses enacted once for each of the randomly drawn assignments. Modelled information is then
combined across these draws in a process borrowing from the multiple imputation approach for missing
data (Bray et al 2015).
The third assignment option is proportional assignment (Vermunt 2010). Proportional assignment applies
as weights, in the regression analysis, the unit-specific array of posterior probabilities. On this basis
proportional assignment is often referred to as probability weighting. Moreover, as this approach allows for
units having fractional, or partial membership, in all classes it is viewed as a soft partitioning method.
Irrespective of which of the three assignment methods is applied, regression analyses that are based on
normative three-step ‘classify-analyse’ approaches suffer from the attenuation of regression estimates

centred application, DIF implies that two neighbourhoods in the same social fragmentation class would have differential item
endorsement probabilities. Nylund (2007) notes that depending on the ‘consistency’ of the DIF signal across classes, it may
not “be important to incorporate it in the longitudinal model” however, “It is worthwhile to explore the effect of ignoring DIF in
these models”, therefore it is important that “the possibility of DIF [is] explored at each time point for [given] items.”

49

(Bolck et al 2004, Vermunt 2010). Downward-biased estimates of the association between class
membership and auxiliary variables are an artefact of the classification error introduced in a three-step
approach - unless classification is perfect - when units are assigned to latent classes, with class membership
effectively treated as known, or as an observed variable (Bolck et al 2004, Vermunt 2010).
Bias-adjusted three-step approaches
A number of methods have aimed to correct this attenuation by carrying over into the conditional model
the model-estimated uncertainties in latent class assignment classification, weighting membership for
example by the classification error (for examples see Bolck et al 2004, Clark and Muthén 2009, Vermunt
2010). Despite this attention to classification error that corrects the parameter estimates, derived standard
errors can remain biased on account of the residual uncertainty regarding latent class membership and
unaccounted for variance in the estimates (Bakk et al 2014). Depending on the method of assignment,
modal or proportional, standard errors may be under- or over-estimated; the former functions to tighten
confidence intervals and enhance the prospect of a Type-I error, while the latter may lessen statistical
power (Bakk et al 2014).
A newer bias-adjusted three-step approach, based on likelihood theory, attends to bias of both the point
estimates and standard errors, strengthening statistical inference (Bakk et al 2014). However, to date this
bias-adjusted approach has only been configured for cross-sectional latent class models. While it could be
applied to longitudinal models, as Di Mari et al (2016) noted, any correction of the standard errors in
longitudinal applications for bias would have to account for the temporal correlation of observations and
their influence on assignment; a methodological advancement still wanting.
Covariate analysis - mathematics
With regards to LTA-covariate analysis, to include a single, time-invariant covariate-X, and to predict its
influence on latent class membership and transitions over time, the LTA model presented in equation-7 is
extended as follows (equation-C3):22
𝑛𝑠

𝑛𝑠

𝑀

𝑟𝑚

𝑇
𝐼(𝑦 =𝑘)

𝑃(𝑌𝑖 = 𝑦|𝑋𝑖 = 𝑥) = ∑ … ∑ 𝛿𝑠1 (𝑥) 𝑡𝑠2 |(𝑥) … 𝑡𝑠𝑡 |(𝑥) ∏ ∏ ∏ 𝑝𝑚𝑘𝑚
𝑠1 =1

𝑠𝑡 =1

[𝐶3]

𝑚=1 𝑘=1 𝑡=1

Where, the ρ, δ, and τ parameters are interpreted the same as in Equation-7, and ‘a latent transition model
with ns dynamic latent classes is estimated based on M-categorical items measured at each of T-times for a
total of MT-items, in addition to a covariate X. Yi= (Yi11, Yi12, …, Yi1M, Yi21, Yi22, …,Yi2M, YiT1, YiT2, …,YiTM)
represents the vector of the subject’s i’s responses for all times t=1, …, T and items m=1, …, M, where a
subject response Yitm may take on the values 1, 2, …, rm. Also, s1i=1, 2... ns is subject’s i’s dynamic latent

class membership at Time-1, while s2i=1, 2, …, ns is subject i’s latent status membership at Time 2, and so
on. Now let I (y = k) be the indicator function which equals 1 if response y equals k and 0 otherwise. In
addition, Xi represents the value of the covariate X for subject I and that the value of X is allowed to relate
to the probability of membership in each dynamic latent class, δ, and each transition probability, τ’ (Lanza
et al 2010, p.*). Moreover, 𝛿𝑠1 (𝑥) represents a baseline-category multinomial logistic model that predicts
subject i’s membership in a dynamic latent class s1 at time-1, where the estimated log-odds ratio compares
the odds of transitioning from the dynamic class ‘n’ at time t-1 to the dynamic class ‘n’ at time t relative to
remaining in the dynamic class ‘na’ at time t given the level of the covariate.

LTA Model: 2001-06-11; Structural Invariance and
Stationarity of Transition Probabilities; k=4

! This is a similar model to the one above (LTA
AR1 model with measurement invariance) however
here Stationarity is being imposed on the
propensity for transitions across time points

! Measurement model …
! Unique Starting Values – mean thresholds – one
per indicator are referenced; starting values are
in logit form
! Equality constraints are referenced by numeric
values given in parentheses e.g. (1)
! There are x36 equality constraints that are
repeated across the c(1), c(2), and c(3) submodel commands
