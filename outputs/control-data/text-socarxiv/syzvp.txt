Abstract
Social integration is considered crucially important for understanding the adverse effect of
unemployment on mental health. Social integration is assumed to either bring about the health effects
of unemployment (causal pathway hypothesis) or shield the unemployed from such effects (buffering
hypothesis). However, there is scarce empirical evidence, especially based on panel data, regarding
these two hypotheses. In our analysis, we use up to ten waves of the “Labour Market and Social
Security” (PASS) German panel study and apply fixed effects panel regressions to account for
unobserved confounders. We test several indicators that cover different aspects of social integration
(numbers of strong and weak ties, conflict in the household, employed friends, general and job searchspecific social support). We find no empirical support for the causal pathway hypothesis and only very
limited support for the buffering hypothesis.

Introduction
Because unemployment can be a stressful life event, it disrupts the organization of people`s lives (Pearlin
1989). Detrimental effects on health, especially mental health, are a well-documented consequence of
such stressful disruptions (Brand 2015, Paul and Moser 2009). However, there remains a gap in our
understanding of how exactly unemployment affects mental health. This lack is unfortunate because
understanding the mechanism is the precondition for developing policy measures to improve the
unemployed`s mental health status and thus enhance re-employability. This is not to say that such
measures do not already exist (see Moore et al. 2017, Hollederer 2018). However, they are typically not
based on a single causal health-enhancing mechanism but on a mixture, e.g., among social support, job
search assistance and training (see e.g. Davies 1996). As a consequence, even if such measures should
yield positive effects, it is still unclear what role social integration plays.
In our analysis, we want to focus on individuals’ social integration and its beneficial effects as a
frequently invoked explanation for why some of the unemployed are in worse mental health than others
and both in worse health than the employed. Two schools of thought can be distinguished. First, some
scholars consider the dissolution or weakening of people’s social relationships with others to be one of
the major pathways for how unemployment deteriorates mental health (the causal pathway hypothesis).
They argue that social integration generally creates beneficial health effects, but unemployment changes
the network such that the benefits are reduced or are no longer provided (e.g. Jahoda 1982, Warr 1987).
From this perspective, policy measures that support the unemployed in maintaining their social
integration during unemployment would make sense. Second, other scholars assume that social
integration helps the unemployed to experience their situation as less disruptive and threatening, thereby
buffering against the harmful consequences of unemployment (the buffering hypothesis) (e.g. Cohen
2004). From this perspective, in contrast, policy measures should be supported that focus especially on
those of the unemployed who, even before becoming unemployed, were comparatively isolated or have
only a few supportive relationships in their networks.
Given the large and still growing literature on the causal effect of social networks and mental health
(Berkman et al. 2000; Smith and Christakis 2008), it would be difficult to deny the importance of social
integration. In addition, there is also a sizable literature on the negative effect of unemployment (Paul
and Moser 2009). However, empirical research on the causal connections among all three variables has
been considerably scarcer. This situation holds for both the causal pathway and buffering hypotheses.
In this paper, first, we want to contribute to the literature by testing these two theoretical mechanisms in
one analysis; i.e., we go beyond the few existing tests by not focusing exclusively on one or the other
aspect of social integration. Second, we use a broad range of measures, covering different aspects of
social integration. Third, we use panel data from a general population survey, allowing us to account for
unobserved time-constant confounders -- something not typically done in the existing literature.

Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical reasoning underlying the causal
pathway and buffering hypotheses and derives our hypotheses. Section 3 presents the state of the
research regarding the role of social integration in the mental health of the unemployed. Section 4
presents our data and operationalizations, discusses fixed effects regressions as a means to account for
unobserved confounders and introduces moderation and mediation analysis as our analytical strategy.
Section 5 reports the results of our empirical analysis, section 6 discusses our findings and addresses the
limitations of our analysis, and section 7 concludes.

Theoretical considerations and hypotheses
There is ample empirical evidence that mental health is causally determined by unemployment (e.g.,
Stauder 2019, Cygan-Rehm et al. 2017, Gebel and Voßemer 2014), although some authors have also
reported null effects (e.g., Böckerman and Ilmakunnas 2009, Schmitz 2011). However, the matter of
which causal mechanisms are triggered after job loss and lead to negative mental health largely remains
an open question. For many scholars, social integration plays a key role in this regard.
Social integration is a generic term comprising different theoretical concepts. According to Berkman et
al. (2000), the extent, shape and nature of an individual’s social integration and subsequent effects on
health outcomes depend on factors at three levels3: first, on the given social-structural conditions at the
macro level; second, on the social relationships that form their social networks at the mezzo level; and
third, on the psychosocial mechanisms embedded in the social networks at the micro level. In our singlecountry analysis, the macro context remains constant; therefore, we focus on the mezzo and micro levels.
For both levels, Berkman et al. (2000) listed several sub-dimensions with various sub-sub-dimensions,
and we only focus on those relevant to our study. At the mezzo level, social networks` structural features
(e.g., size or homogeneity) and the characteristics of social ties (e.g., intimacy) are distinguished. At the
micro level, the psychosocial mechanisms comprise, among others, social support4 (e.g., informational
or emotional) and social engagement (e.g., reinforcement of meaningful social roles or interpersonal
attachment).
As summarized by Thoits (2011), a variety of reasons for why social integration enhances mental health
in everyday interaction have been proposed: Social integration positively affects mental health by
providing belonging, companionship and everyday social support. Emotional, informational and

3

Berkman et al. (2000) also addressed a fourth aspect, namely the pathways (health behavioral, psychological
and physiological) that transmit the health effects of social integration.
4
The provision of social support differs based on the intimacy of social ties. According to Granovetter (1973),
others who are connected to the ego via strong ties are also likely to be connected to each other via weak ties. In
contrast, others to whom the ego is connected via weak ties are often unconnected. Whereas strong ties are more
motivated to share their resources, weak ties provide more non-redundant support, i.e., resources that cannot be
provided by other network members. Despite their different properties, Thoits (2011) argued that both types of
ties are important contributors to an individual’s health, although for different reasons.

instrumental support obtained from the social network sustains the receiver’s self-esteem, sense of
mattering and perceived control over minor or impending obstacles, thus leading to positive mental
health outcomes. Positive psychological states, which are decisive for mental health outcomes, are also
influenced by role identities since social roles provide purpose and meaning in life and, in the case of
successful role performance, engender self-esteem and a sense of control over life. Furthermore, social
integration affects health behaviors through social influence, social control and role expectations.
Regarding the role of social integration in the causal relationship between unemployment and mental
health, two distinct theoretical strands can be found in the literature. One strand assumes that social
integration causally mediates the effect of unemployment in the sense that changes in social integration
help to induce the causal effect. The other strand assumes causal buffering, in which the adverse effect
of unemployment depends on the individual`s ability to activate social resources through his or her
social network.
The causal pathway hypothesis
Regarding the causal pathway hypothesis, the literature has commonly held that a weakening or
dissolution of social integration constitutes at least one of the pathways through which unemployment
causes mental health to deteriorate. For example, a common theoretical framework in unemployment
research is Jahoda’s (1981) concept of latent deprivation. According to this concept, if individuals lose
their jobs, social contacts are one of five latent functions of work lost, in addition to the manifest function
of income provision (the others are time structure, collective purpose, social identity/status, and
activity). The loss of these latent functions causes distress among the unemployed. In Warr’s (1987)
conceptual framework for analyzing how work and unemployment impact health, interpersonal contacts
are one of the key “vitamins”, i.e., environmental determinants of mental health.
There are many reasons why unemployment can severely and negatively influence social integration
(see Jones 1988 for an overview). First, almost by definition, unemployment separates individuals from
routine interactions with their former colleagues (Jahoda 1982). Second, the unemployed might tend to
actively withdraw from certain social contacts. Through reduced income, unemployment can create
financial restrictions that prevent individuals from participating in costly social activities (Warr 1987),
leading to financial stress, which dissolves social support (Kong et al. 1993), impedes the capacity to
reciprocate in social exchange (Sattler and Diewald 2010) or more generally leads to feelings of shame
(Rantakeisu et al. 1999) and therefore to network withdrawal. Furthermore, scarce financial resources
can cause conflicts within households, change the composition of household members (Sattler and
Diewald 2010) or even lead to the dissolution of households due to the breakup of partnerships (Gallie
et al. 2003). However, not only are informal relationships disrupted by unemployment, but the
unemployed are also less likely to actively participate in formal voluntary associations (Wilcock and
Franke 1963). Third, the dissolution of social ties might be initiated by the unemployed individual’s
4

social contacts themselves, who feel embarrassed by the job loser’s low social status or blame him/her
for the situation. Additionally, due to reduced resources, the unemployed are less able to return favors
and thus are less attractive partners for social exchange. Furthermore, contacts might withdraw from the
unemployed because of unemployment stigma (Paugam and Russel 2000; Klärner and Knabe 2016).
In summary, the causal pathway hypothesis states that social connections have a beneficial effect on
mental health regardless of employment status, but since unemployment leads to a weakening or
dissolution of social relationships, the unemployed are deprived of the health-promoting effects of social
integration. Therefore, our first hypothesis is as follows:
Hypothesis 1: Social integration is a mechanism in the causal pathway linking unemployment to mental
health.
The buffering hypothesis
The above view of social integration as a causal mechanism between unemployment and health contrasts
with the equally comprehensive but mostly unconnected literature on social support. From the causalpathway perspective, social integration provides beneficial health effects regardless of the occurrence
of stress, but unemployment changes social relationships such that the benefits are reduced or are no
longer provided. From the causal-buffer perspective, the key assumption is that individuals need only
to activate social support from their networks in cases of stressful life events or conditions, such as
unemployment (Cassel 1976, Cobb 1976). Thus, the buffering literature has often implicitly assumed
that social integration remains unchanged and that the benefits of this network are reaped only in cases
of need (Thoits 1982).
The literature on buffering has often focused on social support in the form of resources provided or not
to the individual by significant others (Umberson et al. 2010), and it has distinguished between perceived
and actually received social support, with the typical result that perceived support is more important for
buffering against the adverse effects of stress (Uchino 2009). While received social support refers to
concrete interactions with others and the actual provision of social support, perceived social support
refers to the belief and trust of an individual that social support is available to him/her (Shor et al. 2013).
Wethington and Kessler (1986) argued that the perception of available support renders stressful
situations seem less threatening and more manageable, thus alleviating their adverse effects on mental
health. However, the buffering hypothesis is not limited to social support alone. Even if not all network
members are likely to provide social support, it is generally acknowledged that social support is
connected to social embeddedness (Wellman 1981; Berkman et al. 2000; Faber and Wassermann 2002;
Uchino 2004). Therefore, our second hypothesis is as follows:
Hypothesis 2: The negative causal effect of unemployment on mental health is buffered against by social
integration.

State of empirical research
Despite a comprehensive literature on the health benefits of social relationships in general (cf., Berkman
et al. 2000) and social support in particular (cf., Thoits 2011, Shor et al. 2013), empirical evidence
regarding the causal pathway hypothesis or the buffering hypothesis has been somewhat scarce. Given
the empirical evidence regarding the effects of unemployment on social network dissolution (Diewald
2007, Atkinson et al. 1986) or isolation (Gallie et al. 2001), the existence of a causal pathway seems
obvious. However, the complete causal chain connecting unemployment, social integration and health
has been rarely investigated. In Kessler et al. (1987), marital strain and the frequency of informal contact
with neighbors, friends or relatives were not found to mediate the effect of unemployment on mental or
physical health. The authors analyzed a sample from one area of the US. Janlert and Hammarström
(2009) used data from 1,044 school leavers and found that the amount of social support at age 30,
measured by the availability of social interaction and the availability of attachment, mediates the
negative effect on physical health of the total amount of time in unemployment between the ages of 16
and 30 but not the negative effect of the same variable on mental health. Janlert and Hammarström
(2009) used longitudinal information, but to the best of our knowledge, the only study that used panel
data and explicitly controlled for unobserved confounders was from Krug and Eberl (2018). Based on a
general population survey and panel data regressions, the authors found that neither the number of strong
ties (close friends and relatives outside the household) nor the availability of weak ties through
memberships in voluntary leisure organizations mediates the causal effect of unemployment on selfrated health and mental health.
For the buffering hypothesis, the situation is similar. A wealth of empirical evidence exists documenting
the alleviating effect of social integration on the effect of stress on mental health, but actual research
regarding the potentially stressful event of unemployment has been much rarer. Several authors have
applied cross-sectional data analysis. For example, Kessler et al. (1988) showed that, among the
unmarried, social support, measured as integration into affiliative networks and access to intimate and
confiding relationships, buffers against the effect of unemployment on both physical and mental illness.
Axelsson and Ejlertsson (2002) focused on young adults and their mental health and found buffering
effects of social support from fathers, mothers and relatives among men, as well as buffering effects of
social support from friends and the availability of close contacts outside the home among women. In
contrast, Åslund et al. (2014) showed with Swedish data that tangible social support and memberships
in organizations do not buffer against the effect of unemployment on psychosomatic symptoms and
psychological well-being.
Among those based on longitudinal data, the study by Atkinson et al. (1986) analyzed the buffering
mechanism at two time points. The authors found a buffering of family cohesion but not for marital
support or the wife’s role performance for mental health among 82 male workers. In their analysis of
235 migrants from East to West Germany in three waves, Schwarzer et al. (1994) found fewer physical
6

health restrictions for those who were socially supported. The authors used a combined measure of
received and perceived social support. Using a sample of 100 male workers who lost their jobs due to
firm closure, Gore (1978) examined various mental and physical health changes at five stages (before
and after termination). The author provided descriptive evidence for better physical health of those who
were able to activate social support during unemployment. Social support was measured by an index
aggregating perceived support from close contacts, the frequency of activity outside the home and the
perceived opportunity to engage in activities that are satisfying and that allow him/her to talk about
his/her problems. The only study controlling for unobserved confounders by way of panel data fixed
effects regressions was Milner et al. (2016). The authors found the negative effects of unemployment
on mental health to be buffered by their summative index of perceived social support from friends and
family members.

Data and methods
Data
In our analysis, we use the “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS) German panel study (Bethmann
et al. 2013, Trappmann et al. 2013). PASS is a household survey that uses a dual frame for sampling.
The first subsample is a probability sample of the German residential population and includes the shortterm unemployed. The second subsample is drawn from registries of welfare benefit recipients,
including the long-term unemployed. At the time of writing, ten waves were available for research,
containing approximately 40,000 individuals from 25,000 households. The questionnaire5 focuses on
labor market-related issues and transfer payments, as well as the material and social conditions of
households and social inclusion.
Our main dependent variable is mental health (“How strongly have you been affected by mental
problems, such as fear, dejection or irritability, in the past 4 weeks?”), measured on a five-point scale
from “extremely” (1) to “not at all” (5). For sensitivity checks, we also conducted our analysis with a
measure of self-rated health6. The key independent variables are measures of unemployment and social
integration. For employment status, we follow the classification provided by PASS. First, individuals
are classified as employed if they are gainfully employed beyond marginal employment. Second,
individuals are classified as unemployed if they are registered as unemployed with the local employment
office or if they are not registered but self-classify as unemployed7. Third, individuals are classified in

Based on the following question: “How would you describe your state of health in the past 4 weeks in
general?”. The variable was measured on a five-point scale, from “bad” (1) to “very good” (5).
7
In Germany, the unemployment insurance and welfare benefit system has a high coverage rate. In our data,
only 336 observations are from individuals who consider themselves unemployed, without being registered at

7

a residual category, “out of labor force”, if they report their current status as retiree, homemaker,
apprentice, or student (at school or university) or if they are currently on parental leave, in military
service, in civilian service, or in further training. To measure social integration, we use several different
indicators that focus on the different aspects of social integration at both the mezzo level (social
networks) and the micro level (psychological mechanisms) (Berkman et al. 2000).
Our first measure of social integration is the natural log number of close friends or family members
outside the household8. This measure captures the size of the part of the network that consists of strong
ties. According to Granovetter (1973), tie strength is a function of the following characteristics: the
amount of time, emotional intensity, intimacy, and reciprocal service. Thus, strong ties focus on the
more intimate relationships. Conversely, the number of active memberships in voluntary organizations
measures the size of one part of the network consisting mainly of weak ties. In the terminology of
Berkman et al. (2000), both measures focus on social networks at the mezzo level, combining size as an
aspect of network structure with intimacy as a characteristic of network ties. Whereas Granovetter
(1973) argued that intimate and non-intimate ties provide different resources, Thoits (2011) pointed out
that both types of ties or resources play important roles in the individual’s mental health.
The third measure, conflicts in the household, focuses on psychological mechanisms at the micro level
and measures social engagement in the form of interpersonal attachment (cf., Berkman et al. 2000)
within the individual’s household. The measure is based on the survey question “How often do
misunderstandings, tensions or conflicts occur in your household?”. The variable is measured on a five
point scale that we reversed to have higher values reflect lower prevalence of conflicts (“very often”,
“often”, “sometimes”, “rarely”, “very rarely or never”). We recoded the scale to range from zero to four,
instead of one to five, to avoid misinterpretation of the main effects in the interaction models (cf., Mayerl
and Urban 2019). The measure per definition covers individuals in multi-person households, but no
individuals who live in single-member households. In focusing on the interpersonal attachments of
unemployed individuals with other household members, it refers to the closest ties within the ego
network.
The fourth measure is derived from a name generator9 regarding the three closest confidants outside the
household, and it is the total number of employed individuals among them. This variable focuses on the
their local employment offices. Omitting observations from unregistered unemployed people does not change the
results of our analysis.
8
To avoid negative values, we added 1 before logarithmizing the number of strong ties. Thus, a value of 0 in the
logarithmized variable reflects 0 strong ties, which is especially helpful for the interpretation of the main effects
in regressions with interactions, which we used to test the buffering hypothesis. We used the logarithm because
we assume that the effect of an additional strong tie decreases with the overall number of strong ties in the
network. However, we also conducted our analysis without logarithmizing the variable (see Tables A18 and
A19), and the results did not differ substantially.
9
The name generator is an instrument for obtaining network data, originally developed by Burt (1984) and applied
in many general population surveys since then. In our survey, the interviewees were asked a stimulus question
(name generator) to think about the person outside the household who is most important to them. Subsequently,
the interviewees were asked about several characteristics of this person (gender, education, employment status)

8

mezzo level of network structure in that it measures the network’s tendency toward homophily in tie
formation with regard to employment status. The fifth and sixth measures again focus on the
psychological mechanism, specifically social support. In contrast to the usual distinction of appraisal,
instrumental, informational, and emotional support, we distinguish between support related to job
searches and more general social support. Both measures are based on the concept of the resource
generator by van der Gaag and Snijders (2005) and adapted to the context of job search by Wolf (2009).
The measures capture the perceived availability of the respective social support resources. For perceived
general social support, we use a sum score of six binary indicators of different types of support (e.g.,
“Do you know someone whose advice you can trust?”). For job search social support, we use a sum
score of four binary indicators (e.g., “Do you know someone who would point out a job vacancy to
you?”). In addition to the theoretically well-established buffering effect of social support, theoretical
reasoning highlights the direct influence of social support on mental health (Thoits 1982). Table A1
provides a more detailed overview of the social integration variables that we use. Table A2 provides
information about the partial correlations of the social integration variables, which are weak with the
two social support measures as the only exception.
By testing not one but several such indicators, we aim to obtain a broader picture regarding the role of
social integration in the health of the unemployed. However, even if we go beyond what has been
analyzed in the context of unemployment, we acknowledge that we are only covering some of the
aspects discussed in the literature on social integration and (mental) health. Most notably, as is the case
in most general population studies, network characteristics, such as density, closure or balance, which
might play a role in mental health, are not available but might be important for health (cf., Klärner et al.
2019; and Ellwardt et al. 2019).
Among the indicators of social integration, only strong ties, weak ties and conflicts within the household
are available for all ten waves of the panel. Job search social support was measured in waves 3, 5 and 9.
The remaining two indicators were available for waves 3 and 5. Our analytical sample is restricted to
individuals with at least two observations, and we further restrict our sample to individuals in the
working age range of 16 to 64 years old.
Several control variables accounting for compositional differences between employed and unemployed
individuals are also included in the regressions. We must control only for time-varying factors since we
conduct our regression analysis with fixed effects (see the next subsection). We include years of
schooling, work experience, previous unemployment experience (dummy), number of children,
household size, age groups and dummies for the survey waves. We do not include household income
because, with respect to the causal pathway hypothesis, it is unclear whether the variable is on the same

and their relationship with this person (frequency of conflicts, intimacy). The procedure was also conducted for
the second and third most important people.

on the dependent and independent variables, including between and within standard deviations, see
Table A3 in the appendix.
Methods and analytic strategy
To test the causal pathway and buffering hypotheses, we conducted two different types of tests11.
Whereas the causal pathway hypothesis was tested using a mediator analysis, we implemented a
moderator analysis to test whether social integration acts as a buffer. As Wu and Zumbo (2008) pointed
out, the terms “mediator” and “moderator” both imply causal relationships instead of mere correlations,
which is why it is important to adopt a causal research design for empirical analysis. We do so by taking
full advantage of the longitudinal information in the data and conducting fixed effects panel regressions
(Halaby 2004, Brüderl and Ludwig 2015). By our focusing on intra-individual change, fixed effects
regression accounts for not only observed but also unobserved confounders, as long as they are constant
over the observation period. A statistically significant coefficient in a fixed effects regression indicates
that a within-person change between waves in the focal independent variable is associated with a withinperson change in the dependent variable. This within estimate presents a stronger argument for causality
than mere static comparisons between persons with different levels of the focal dependent and
independent variables (between variation) by differencing out all unobserved confounders, provided that
they are constant over the observation period. The data transformation that underlies the fixed effects
estimation and eliminates both unobserved and observed time-constant variables is called demeaning or
within transformation.
Mediator analysis
In our test for the potential mediation effects of social integration, we follow the procedure proposed by
Baron and Kenny (1986) and implement it in our fixed effects regression.
The starting point of the fixed effects estimator is the error components model:
𝑚ℎ𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝑢𝑖𝑡 + 𝒙′𝒊𝒕 𝜽𝟏 + 𝛼𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,

(1)

where the dependent variable 𝑚ℎ𝑖𝑡 is mental health, 𝑢𝑖𝑡 is the focal independent variable unemployment,
and 𝒙′𝒊𝒕 is a vector of control variables for person 𝑖 at time point 𝑡. Furthermore, 𝛽1 and the vector 𝜽𝟏
are the coefficients to be estimated, 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the idiosyncratic and 𝛼𝑖 the time-constant error term. The latter

10

Income loss might lead to financial shame and adversely impact the health-promoting quality of social
integration, but it can also impact health via pathways not related to social integration, for example, the ability to
buy high-quality food. As a robustness check, we also conducted the main analyses of this paper controlling for
household income, and the results were very similar (see Tables A20 and A21).

is eliminated by subtracting all of the variables from their person-specific means over 𝑡 (indicated by
the bar), resulting in the following:
𝑚ℎ𝑖𝑡 − ̅̅̅̅
𝑚ℎ𝑖 = 𝛽1 (𝑢𝑖𝑡 − 𝑢̅𝑖 ) + (𝒙𝒊𝒕 − ̅
𝒙𝒊 )′ 𝜽𝟏 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 − 𝜀̅𝑖 .

(2)

or shorter (with ~ representing the de-meaned variables):
̃ 𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝑢̃𝑖𝑡 + 𝒙
̃′𝒊𝒕 𝜽𝟏 + 𝜀̃𝑖𝑡 .
𝑚ℎ

(3)

For a mediation effect to make sense, 𝛽1 should be significantly different from zero -- in our case with
a negative sign. The mediator analysis is then based on two equations. First, Equation (3) is augmented
by social integration 𝑠 as an additional independent variable, resulting in the following:
̃ 𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽2 𝑢̃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾1 𝑠̃𝑖𝑡 + 𝒙
̃′𝒊𝒕 𝜽𝟐 + 𝜀̃𝑖𝑡 .
𝑚ℎ

(4)

Second, social integration is regressed on unemployment and the control variables:
̃′𝒊𝒕 𝜽𝟑 + 𝜀̃𝑖𝑡 ,
𝑠̃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛿1 𝑢̃𝑖𝑡 + 𝒙

(5)

A mediation effect, and thus support for hypothesis 1, is present if the indirect effect is significantly
different from zero, where the indirect effect is measured as the product of 𝛾1 and 𝛿1 (equivalent to the
difference between 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 ). Statistical significance is determined by a test proposed by Sobel (1982).
Additionally, we conducted the Aroian test, which is a stricter version of the Sobel test (Baron and
Kenny 1986). Although the p-values tend to be slightly higher for the Aroian test, both versions lead to
the same conclusions after applying standard significance levels.
Moderator analysis
The buffering hypothesis is tested by moderation analysis. A moderating factor is usually seen as
something not influenced by the causal factor under investigation but rather that strengthens, weakens
or suppresses the causal effect, depending on its manifestation (Wu and Zumbo 2008). The case of social
integration is one of the rare cases in which theories predict both a mediator and a moderator effect.
The moderator test simply augments Equation (4) with an interaction between social integration and
unemployment, leading to the following:
̃
̃ 𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽3 𝑢̃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾2 𝑠̃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿2 (𝑢𝑖𝑡
̃′𝒊𝒕 𝜽𝟐 + 𝜀̃𝑖𝑡 ,
𝑚ℎ
∙ 𝑠𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝒙

(6)

where a statistically significant (and in our case positive) coefficient 𝛿2 would support hypothesis 2.
There are two additional predictions, which are controversial in the discussion in the buffering literature.
First, a “pure” moderation effect would imply that the social integration that buffers against the
unemployment effect is not itself influenced by unemployment; that is, 𝛿1 should be near zero and
statistically insignificant. Second, support for the “strong” version of the buffering hypothesis would
11

imply that, for those who are employed, the social integration that buffers against the unemployment
effect should be irrelevant. In terms of Equation (6), assuming that 𝑢̃𝑖𝑡 is a dummy variable that takes
the value of 1 for the unemployed and 0 for employed individuals, it is equivalent to the coefficient 𝛾2
of social integration being close to zero and statistically insignificant.

This section describes the results for both the causal pathway and buffering hypotheses.
Mediator test of the causal pathway hypothesis (H1)
In this subsection, we present the results for our mediator test of the causal pathway hypothesis (Table
1)12. First, from a regression based on Equation (3), we observe a significantly negative coefficient of
unemployment on mental health. As shown in Column 1 of Table 1, the estimate for 𝛽1 is 0.223 for the
ten-wave sample, and it varies only slightly if the regression is conducted on fewer waves. The indirect
effect is based on the product of 𝛾1 and 𝛿1 from Equations (4) and (5). It is interpreted as the absolute
value (Column 4) of the respective unemployment effect due to the intermediate effect on social
integration. As we can see, for all six indicators of social integration, the indirect effect is negligibly
small and statistically insignificant. A closer look at the components of the indirect effect shows that the
reasons why the respective aspects of social integration do not mediate the unemployment effect differ:
The number of strong ties and the frequency of conflicts in the household have significant impacts on
mental health (Column 2 of Table 1), but at the same time, they are insignificantly affected by
unemployment (Column 3 of Table 1)13. Regarding weak ties and job search support, we do not find
that they are significantly influenced by unemployment or that they significantly affect mental health
outcomes. For employed friends and general social support, we find that, even if they are adversely
impacted by unemployment, these aspects of social integration do not seem to be relevant for the
individual’s mental health. To summarize our results for hypothesis 1, we found no support for the
hypothesis that any of our social integration indicators lie on the causal pathway between unemployment
and mental health.
Moderator test of the buffering hypothesis (H2)
The previous subsection identified two indicators of social integration that were impacted by
unemployment (Table 1). Some authors have argued that, for such indicators, a moderation effect is not

12

To test whether fixed-effects regressions are necessary, instead of the otherwise more efficient random effects
regressions, we conducted a Hausman test. The test led to (strong) rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating
that fixed-effects regressions are to be preferred.
13
An explanation for the missing effect of unemployment on the frequency of conflicts in the household could
be that the measure is implicitly conditioned on the household remaining intact because single households are
excluded. However, as Table A22 shows, unemployment does not increase the probability that individuals
transition to single-person households.

12

possible. However, we argue, in opposition to this “pure” buffering hypothesis, i.e., that social
integration can be impacted by stressful events, but the remaining social integration can also function as
a buffer against adverse health effects. Therefore, we chose to test all six indicators for moderator
effects.
Table 2 reports the results of these tests, where the coefficient 𝛿2 of the interaction effects indicates the
amount of causal moderation. Starting with active memberships, we find no significant interaction effect
and therefore no empirical support for the moderator hypothesis. In contrast, for friends and family
members, a significant interaction effect is observed, lending support to hypothesis 2. However, a
significant unconditional effect also indicates that, even for employed individuals, strong ties positively
impact mental health. This finding contradicts the strong version of the buffering hypothesis.
Nevertheless, we view the result as being at least weak evidence for a buffering effect.
For the frequency of conflicts within the household, we observe no significant interaction effect but only
a significant main effect, as is also the case for the number of employed friends. For general social
support and job search social support (Models 5 and 6), we observe insignificant main effects, and the
interaction coefficients are far from statistically significant as well. Therefore, the results for general
and job search social support do not support hypothesis 2.
Robustness and sensitivity checks
We conducted several robustness and sensitivity checks. First, we conducted our empirical analysis with
the more global health indicators of self-rated health (see Tables A7 and A8). The results were often
identical but also deviated in some respects. These deviations might be due to differences in the aspects
of health that both outcome variables measure. Whereas self-rated health includes both psychological
and physiological aspects of health, our mental health indicator focuses on psychological health only.
However, because we have no indicators of physical health that are available in all of the panel waves,
no empirical test of this assumption is possible. In addition, the deviations are only minor. Second, we
conducted the analysis using unemployment duration instead of the binary measure of unemployment
(see Tables A9 and A10). In general, the results were qualitatively similar. Where they deviated, they
provide even less support for the buffering hypothesis because the respective interaction effect of strong
ties is insignificant. Third, the results of the mediator and moderator test do not change if we conduct
the analysis with binary indicators for weak ties and both types of social support (see Tables A11 and
A12). Fourth, because our research design is based on multiple tests of similar variables using the same
data set, we applied a Bonferroni correction, adjusting the p-values for multiple tests. We find that, after
considering multiple tests, even the single remaining buffering effect due to strong ties becomes
insignificant.

Finally, fixed effects regressions cannot control for reverse causality. Although fixed effects regressions
are well suited to establishing a causal relationship between dependent and independent variables, the
direction of this causal relationship is often undetermined (cf., Gunasekara et al. 2014). Therefore,
reverse causality could be an alternative explanation for our results for two reasons. On the one hand, if
the coefficient of unemployment on mental health reflects the selection of unhealthy workers into
unemployment, there might be no causal pathway between unemployment and mental health (only in
the other direction). Therefore social integration cannot lie on the causal pathway, explaining why we
find no support for hypothesis 1. On the other hand, the missing buffering effect might be explained by
a causal effect of social integration on unemployment, for which a decline in social integration is the
reason why workers become and stay unemployed.
To address this possibility, at least for measures available for ten waves, we investigated the mental
health and social integration trajectories during employment three or more years, two year and one years
before becoming unemployed, compared to being unemployed (see Tables A13 and A14 in the
appendix). For social integration, we find no statistically significant downward trajectory. For mental
health, we also do not observe a significant declining trajectory, but the point estimates do monotonically
decline, and mental health three years and more before unemployment is ca. 0.31 points higher, two
years ca. 0.24 points higher and one year before unemployment only ca. 0.16 higher than during
unemployment (see Table A13). Such a pattern is indeed in line with reverse causality but could also
arise due to so-called anticipation effects; i.e., the stress that goes along with anticipating becoming
unemployed reduces health even before the actual job loss occurs. To fully ensure that it is not reverse
causality that creates this pattern, we conducted a dynamic panel data regression and found that the
coefficient of unemployment on mental health was still strong and statistically significant, even after
eliminating reverse causality (see Table A15)14. In conclusion, we find that reverse causality does not
explain the lack of empirical evidence regarding the buffering and causal pathway effects of social
integration.

Discussion and limitations
We applied a broad range of measures of social integration to investigate the hypotheses that either they
are on the causal pathway from unemployment to mental health, or they buffer against the adverse
effects of unemployment. In contrast to theoretical expectations, we found that none of our measures
provide empirical evidence for the causal pathway hypothesis and that only one measure, the number of
strong ties, provides some limited empirical evidence for the buffering hypothesis. Regarding the causal

14

We refrained from using dynamic panel data regressions throughout the paper because, especially for the
mediation and moderation tests the necessary quality criteria (for further details on the methods, see Roodman
(2009) were not always fulfilled. However, for the regression focused on the effect of unemployment on mental
health, we found the criteria fulfilled (see Table A15).

15

pathway hypothesis, all of the estimated indirect effects of unemployment via social integration on
mental health were close to zero and insignificant. The main reason for this null result is that we did not
observe the complete causal chain for any of the measures. Whereas the reduction of the number of
employed friends and general social support following unemployment was statistically significant, these
aspects of individuals’ social integration had no effect on mental health. In contrast, both the number of
strong ties and the amount of conflict in the household had statistically significant impacts on mental
health, but there was no corresponding effect of unemployment on these two measures. In all, our results
are in line with the previous, albeit limited, empirical evidence regarding the potential of unemployment
to exert detrimental mental health effects via its adverse effects on social integration, including the only
fixed effects regression (that we are aware of) that addresses the causal path hypothesis (Krug, Eberl
2018).
Regarding the buffering hypothesis, most of the measures of social integration did not significantly
interact with unemployment. Only for the number of strong ties did we find significant interaction
effects, but there were also several factors that cast doubt on this result. First, we also observed a
significant unconditional effect, suggesting that the results are at least not in line with the strict version
of the buffering thesis. Second, the results were no longer significant after a Bonferroni correction was
applied. Thus, we conclude that our results for the most part contradict existing empirical evidence
regarding the ability of social integration to alleviate the adverse effects of unemployment on mental
health. This is also true for the only analysis of the buffering hypothesis relying panel fixed effects
(Milner et al. 2016) that we are aware of. Whether the divergence in results, especially with regard to
the latter analysis, is due to a different institutional context (Australia versus Germany) or different
measures of social integration15 is a question our analysis cannot answer.
We acknowledge that, of course, not all our measures of social integration are ideal. On the one hand,
they often do not exclusively measure only one single aspect of social integration. However, this
ambiguity should nonetheless increase, rather than decrease, the likelihood of capturing the general
effect of social integration on health. On the other hand, the measures are limited in that, for example,
certain structural aspects of the social network could not be observed (e.g., density) or could be observed
but only to a limited degree (loss of contact with former colleagues). However, although the measures
do not cover all of the dimensions of social integration -- Berkman et al. (2000) listed 2 sub-dimensions
for the mezzo and 5 for the micro levels, with between two and seven sub-sub dimensions each -- our
measures do cover many important ones. It is also worth noting that several of our measures exhibited
significant indirect and/or buffering effects in pooled OLS regression models, where unobserved
15

Whereas Milner et al. (2016) measure mental health using the five-item Mental Health
Inventory (MHI), a subscale from the SF-36 general health survey, with regard to social integration they focus
exclusively on social support and construct a measure by taking for each individual respondent the average of 10
social support items measured on a 7-point. Then based on the observed distribution of the resulting variable coded
it in three levels, representing low (1 to 4.69), medium (4.7 to 5.59), and high (5.6 to7) social support.

16

confounders are not controlled for (see Tables A16 and A17 in the appendix). These associations
disappeared once fixed effects regressions were applied, supporting our assumption that the null effects
are not due to the low quality of our measures, but due to our research design controlling for unobserved
confounders. Concerning our measure for mental health, to cover as many waves as possible, we have
to rely on a single 5-point scale measure, whereas other studies use measures that are more complex
(e.g. Milner at al. 2016). However, with a correlation of 0.69 our measure is highly related to the SF-12
mental health component scale, that has been shown to be an adequately valid and reliable measure of
depressive disorders in the general population (e.g. Cheak-Zamora et al. 2009)
Fixed-effects regressions are based exclusively on the within-person variations in the data, which is both
a strength and a limitation. Examining Table A3, we find that within variation in our data is sufficient
for most measures of social integration. However, this point does not hold for the two social support
measures, for which intra-individual changes in the amount of social support are relatively rare. This
fact might pose a serious limitation, especially regarding the buffering hypothesis, because the fixedeffects estimator might have difficulty identifying interaction effects due to the low within variation. In
Table A17, tests of the buffering hypothesis based on pooled ordinary least squares regression are
documented. Here, we can see that the social support measures were the rare case in our data, with
interactions being statistically insignificant even before applying fixed effects, undermining the
argument that the fixed effects reduce the variation necessary to identify a causal effect. However, one
could still argue that even the between variation of the measures is still relatively low. Future waves of
the PASS surveys should not only measure the general availability of a resource but also its amount.

Conclusions
Taken together, our results speak against the importance of social integration for the unemployment–
mental health relationship in two respects. First, social integration does not seem as helpful as many
researchers assume it to be in alleviating the adverse effects of unemployment on health. Second,
although unemployment leads to adverse health effects, it seems to leave the social integration of
unemployed individuals largely intact. This outcome does not mean that social integration is not
important for mental health. Based on our empirical analysis, we found two measures that have a
statistically significant impact on an individual’s health (the number of strong ties and the amount of
conflict in the household). However, in the context of unemployment, the relevance of social integration
does not seem to be as high as the literature has often suggested.
Regarding policy conclusions, according to our results, policy measures focusing exclusively on
enhancing social integration are therefore unlikely to have direct positive effects on the mental health
of the unemployed. However, there might be indirect effects on health if the informational, material or
emotional social support provided by the social network led to re-employment. Furthermore, there might
17

be especially vulnerable subgroups among the unemployed, which do profit from social integration,
even if the general population of the unemployed does not. Further research should focus on identifying
such subgroups.
Regarding the question of what the actual pathways are that lead to health deterioration and what factors
might actually buffer against adverse health effects, the present study can only provide a few guidelines.
First, at least in the German context, the loss of the manifest function of employment plays only a
marginal role. We found no indication of an indirect effect via the unemployed`s diminished household
income. However, household income might not be a perfect measure of the manifest function of work,
and other indicators, such as relative deprivation or poverty, should be considered in future research. As
for status loss as an alternative explanation, although the paper by Krug and Eberl (2018) found
empirical evidence for an indirect effect via the loss of subjective social status, the paper left open the
degree to which this measure not only reflects the unemployed`s self-esteem but also reflects external
status attributions and is thus a reaction to experiences with their immediate social environment or
society as a whole. In short, we have aimed to contribute to understanding the role of social integration,
but given the long tradition of empirical research, many questions regarding alternative pathways or
buffering factors surprisingly remain open and await further empirical investigation.
