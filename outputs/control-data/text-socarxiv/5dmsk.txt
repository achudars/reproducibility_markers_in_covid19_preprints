Shifting Neighborhoods, Shifting Health: A Longitudinal Analysis of Gentrification and
Health in Los Angeles County
Chinyere Agbai
ABSTRACT
Gentrification is characterized by an influx of capital, built environment upgrades, and
physical and social displacement of residents and institutions. The numerous, relatively rapid
transitions that occur during gentrification make accounting for duration of exposure to
gentrification particularly important when exploring its relationship to health. Though a large
literature explores how timing and duration of exposure to relatively stable neighborhood
conditions is linked to health, little is known about how exposure to gentrification is linked to the
health of longtime residents. Using restricted, longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and
Neighborhood Survey, I ask (1) how is duration of exposure to gentrification linked to the selfreported health of those who remain in the neighborhood? (2) How does this relationship vary for
members of different racial and ethnic groups? Results indicate that the longer an individual lives
in a gentrifying neighborhood, the better their self-reported health. The results do not vary by race
or ethnicity. The results of this study are not an endorsement of the use of gentrification as a public
health intervention, as previous work finds that gentrification can also be associated with social,
physical, and institutional displacement, as well as heightened class-based and racial tensions.
Instead, findings reiterate the importance of neighborhood investments for the health and wellbeing of their residents over time.

1. INTRODUCTION
From early works, such as The Philadelphia Negro (Du Bois 1899), through the Chicago
School’s exploration of urban development in concentric circles (Park et al. 1925), urban
sociologists have long been concerned with the role of the neighborhood in reproducing
inequality. More recent work underscores the extent of the residential segregation of American
neighborhoods, which occurred as a result of federal and local policies, white flight, racial
violence, and other factors that gave rise to racially segregated residential patterns (Massey and
Denton 1993; Wilson 1987). Gentrification, or the influx of capital and upper-middle class
residents into formerly disinvested urban neighborhoods (Smith 1996), provides an interesting
example of neighborhood transition because it involves a reversal of the social order of space
(Lefebvre 1991) in which higher-income, predominantly white residents occupied suburbs, while
Black Americans, immigrants, and the poor were confined to central cities.
Local officials of the twenty-first century often promote implicitly pro-gentrification
policies as a means by which to overcome depleted urban tax bases, concentrated poverty, and
street crime in cities across the country. The Amazon Corporation’s recent search for a second
corporate headquarters provides one notable instance of how many localities are prepared to
offer large tax incentives to attract corporations, often at the expense of affordable housing for
existing residents (Casselman 2018; Wingfield 2018). Though gentrification is purported to serve
as a solution to many urban problems (Newman and Wyly 2006; Smith 2002), numerous
questions concerning its impacts on residents remain. For instance, it is not clear how the
experience of living in a gentrifying neighborhood is related to the health of residents. The
neighborhood upgrades, stress, and changes in neighborhood social networks and crime
associated with gentrification may all impact health in potentially conflictual ways. Although

Agbai

gentrification may significantly impact both the physical and psychological health of residents,
little research investigates this relationship.
Existing research on the relationship between gentrification and health employs crosssectional data, inhibiting our ability to understand how exposure to this process of neighborhood
change manifests in health over time (Gibbons and Barton 2016; M. Huynh and Maroko 2014;
Izenberg, Mujahid, and Yen 2018). In addition, despite a large literature concerning how the
residential context and the timing and duration of exposure to neighborhood advantage or
disadvantage affects residents (Jackson and Mare 2007; Kawachi and Berkman 2003; Sharkey
and Elwert 2011; Wodtke, Harding, and Elwert 2011), little is known about how duration of
exposure to this particular set of changing neighborhood conditions is linked to the health of
residents. A longitudinal framework is necessary to fully comprehend the relationship between
gentrification and health, both because some residents experience this changing set of
neighborhood conditions for many years, and because the effects may differ in the short and long
terms.
Drawing on longitudinal data and up to 17 years of residential histories for more than
2,000 adults sampled in the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS), in
addition to decennial Census data, I examine two questions. First, how is duration of exposure to
gentrification linked to the self-reported health of residents? Second, how does this relationship
vary for members of different racial and ethnic groups? Results indicate that the longer an
individual lives in a gentrifying neighborhood, the better their self-reported health. These results
are not driven by a particular racial or ethnic group. These findings have important implications
for policy, and suggest that if longtime residents are to reap the health benefits of the

Agbai

neighborhood improvements that accompany gentrification, efforts must be made to allow these
residents to remain in their neighborhoods as they undergo change.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 The Link Between Gentrification And Health
Gentrification is a process of neighborhood transition that involves upgrades to the built
environment in formerly disinvested neighborhoods; an influx of higher-income, predominantly
white residents; and direct or indirect displacement of those who earn low incomes (Glass 1964;
Hammel and Wyly 1996; Smith 1996). Understanding gentrification through Lefebvre’s (1991)
concept of “social space” provides one lens through which to conceptualize the link between
gentrification and both physical and mental health. He argues that space is not simply the
backdrop of social life, but rather a “means of control, and hence of domination, of power”
(1991:26). Beginning in the 1940s, the spatial power relationship in metropolitan areas across the
United States was one in which whites resided in the suburbs, while Black Americans, other
People of Color, and the poor were confined to increasingly crowded urban neighborhoods
(Connolly 2014; Korver-Glenn 2018; Massey and Denton 1993; Pager and Shepherd 2008).
Gentrification involves a shift in the spatial hierarchy in which capital, as well as white residents
and those of higher socioeconomic status, are increasingly concentrated in urban neighborhoods,
while Black Americans and immigrants are displaced to suburbs with rising levels of poverty
(For review, see Lacy 2016). In the face of the shifting spatial power relations that characterize
gentrification, it is unclear the extent to which the health of longtime residents of these
transitioning neighborhoods might be affected.
One way that gentrification may impact both mental and physical health is through its
effects on place-based social networks (Fullilove 2016). Those with place-based social networks

Agbai

4

experience better psychological and physical health than their more isolated counterparts, largely
because of the material aid, emotional support, information, and services that these networks
provide (Caplan 1974; Cassel 1976; Cohen and McKay 1984; House, Landis, and Umberson
1988; Kawachi and Berkman 2003; Klinenberg 2003). Gibbons, Barton, and Reling (2019) find
that on average, residence in a gentrifying neighborhood is associated with lower community
connections. To the extent that displacement splinters neighborhood social networks, this may
negatively impact both mental and physical health over time.
A second way that gentrification may negatively affect self-reported health is by inducing
stress among longtime residents. An important stressor among longtime residents in gentrifying
neighborhoods is that of displacement, or the fear of it. A vibrant debate exists concerning the
extent to which gentrification displaces longtime residents. Some scholars find little
displacement (Ellen and O’Regan 2011; Freeman 2005; Freeman and Braconi 2004), while
others find more substantial levels (Martin and Beck 2016; Newman and Wyly 2006). In her
review of the gentrification literature, Brown-Saracino (2017) argues that conclusions about
displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods fall broadly along methodological lines, with
qualitative researchers finding physical, political, and cultural displacement of longtime residents
and institutions. Conversely, quantitative scholars often find little or no displacement of lowincome residents. Within quantitative scholarship, however, the operationalization of
displacement matters immensely for conclusions about the extent of displacement in gentrifying
neighborhoods (Carlson 2020). Though it is unclear the extent to which longtime residents
experience physical displacement, Gibbons (2019) argues that these residents may experience
“anticipatory stress” as a result of the fear that they may be displaced (Freeman 2006; Hicken,
Lee, and Hing 2018).

The stress of living in a gentrifying neighborhood may be particularly acute among
residents of color. There is some disagreement about the extent to which Black and Hispanic1
neighborhoods are more or less likely to gentrify than white neighborhoods. Some find that lowincome Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are more likely to experience gentrification (Ellen
and O’Regan 2008), while others find that these neighborhoods are in fact less likely to
experience this kind of neighborhood transition (J. Hwang and Sampson 2014). In New York,
Sutton (2018) finds that those moving into gentrifying neighborhoods are disproportionately
white, although Pattillo (2008) documents notable cases of Black gentrification in Chicago. In
the Black and Hispanic neighborhoods that do gentrify, this process of neighborhood change
often facilitates racial tension in addition to the class-based tension that arises as housing costs
rise and neighborhood businesses are replaced with higher-end establishments (Anderson 1997;
Sullivan and Shaw 2011; Zukin 2011). This racial tension manifests in the use of law
enforcement to police the behavior of Black and Hispanic residents (Freeman 2006; Logan and
Molotch 1987), and attempts to rebrand the neighborhood to distance it from the low-income
People of Color who originally resided there (Hwang 2016; Hyra 2017; Sullivan and Shaw 2011;
Zukin 2011). In Philadelphia, Gibbons (2019) finds that an influx of white residents in particular
is correlated with greater than average stress in gentrifying neighborhoods. Because stress is
positively associated with a range of adverse health outcomes, from the common cold to
coronary artery disease (Krantz and McCeney 2002; Morenoff 2003), increased stressors in
gentrifying neighborhoods may prove particularly detrimental to both the mental and physical
health of longtime Black and Hispanic residents over time.
Conversely, gentrification may be positively linked to health in four important ways.
First, neighborhood upgrades, such as sidewalk or playground repairs, reduce the probability of

Agbai

6

accidents (Ellen, Mijanovich, and Dillman 2001). This may result in improved physical health
over time. Moreover the construction of new grocery stores increases proximity to healthy food,
which may then translate into improved diet among residents (Anguelovski 2015). Second,
changes in crime may have mixed effects on self-reported health in gentrifying neighborhoods.
Gentrification is associated with lower rates of homicide on average, but increased robberies in
Black neighborhoods (Papachristos et al. 2011). Moreover, spatial context plays an important
role in crime in gentrifying neighborhoods. In Los Angeles, gentrifying neighborhoods
surrounded by communities not currently experiencing gentrification suffer more aggravated
assaults than gentrifying neighborhoods surrounded by communities also experiencing this
process of neighborhood change (Boggess and Hipp 2016). Changes in crime in gentrifying
communities may therefore impact the health of residents in opposite directions. On the one
hand, crime and violence have been linked to increased drug use and reduced infant birthweight
(Boardman et al. 2001; Morenoff 2003). As a result, declines in homicides may positively impact
physical, as well as mental, health. However, the uptick in robberies in Black gentrifying
neighborhoods and aggravated assault in upgrading communities surrounded by stable, lowincome communities may negatively impact health.
Third, because neighborhood affluence is associated with higher self-rated health, even
after controlling for individual-level characteristics (Browning, Cagney, and Wen 2003; Wen,
Browning, and Cagney 2003), the rise in neighborhood socioeconomic status that characterizes
gentrification may result in better health among longtime residents. Finally, residents who
remain in gentrifying neighborhoods often report increased neighborhood satisfaction as a result
of the increased commercial activity in the formerly disinvested neighborhood (Ellen and
O’Regan 2011; Freeman 2006). This increased neighborhood satisfaction may then lead to gains

Agbai

in psychological health. This body of literature, then, suggests that a broad array of forces may
act to produce conflictual self-reported health outcomes among longtime residents in gentrifying
neighborhoods.

2.2 Duration Of Exposure to Neighborhood Context
A longitudinal framework is necessary to fully comprehend the link between
gentrification and health, both because some residents experience this relatively turbulent set of
neighborhood conditions for many years, and because the relationship may differ in the short and
long terms (for review, see Hyra et al. 2019). Gibbons and Barton (2016) find that on average,
self-reported health improves for residents of gentrifying neighborhoods. For Black residents,
however, this relationship is negative (Gibbons and Barton 2016; Izenberg et al. 2018). Huynh
and Maroko (2014) find that living in a gentrifying tract is associated with greater odds of preterm birth among Black residents, but lower odds among whites. Though these studies provide
important insight into the relationship between gentrification and health, their use of crosssectional data inhibit our ability to understand how exposure to this process of neighborhood
change accumulates in the bodies of individuals and manifests over time. As a result, attention to
duration of exposure is crucial to understanding how gentrification is associated with a variety of
outcomes, including health.
Extant research demonstrates the link between early life exposure to neighborhood-level
disadvantage and low academic achievement and health outcomes (Jackson and Mare 2007;
Sampson, Sharkey, and Raudenbush 2008; Sampson and Winter 2016; Sharkey and Elwert 2011;
Wodtke et al. 2011). The impact of the neighborhood context on a range of individual-level
outcomes does not end with childhood, however. Persistent exposure to childhood neighborhood

Agbai

8

disadvantage has also been linked to poor mental health (Wheaton and Clarke 2003) and
cognitive ability (Sharkey and Elwert 2011) later in life. Wodtke and colleagues (2011)
underscore the importance of duration of exposure in neighborhood effects research because
these effects are often cumulative and/or lagged, making the use of neighborhood conditions at
one time point insufficient to understand individual-level outcomes. Moreover, because children
often reside in the same kinds of neighborhoods during adulthood as their parents and
grandparents did (Sharkey 2013), the impacts of exposure to a particular kind of neighborhood
context both accumulate throughout the life course and are passed to the next generation (Clarke
et al. 2013; Sampson 2012; Sharkey and Faber 2014). This is evidenced by the fact that the
children and grandchildren of adults who grew up in disadvantaged neighborhoods experience
reduced academic achievement (Sharkey and Elwert 2011) and worse health outcomes (Sharkey
2013). This body of literature, then, suggests that both characteristics of the residential context
and duration of exposure to a particular kind of neighborhood are crucial to understanding the
ways in which the neighborhood affects individuals over and above individual- and family-level
characteristics.
The gentrifying neighborhood offers an opportunity to explore not only neighborhood
effects on health but also the ways in which duration of exposure to a changing neighborhood
context is linked to health. The gentrifying neighborhood creates two important groups in terms
of duration of exposure and residential context. One group is comprised of those who remain in
the neighborhood from the earlier stages of gentrification through the later stages.
Neighborhoods in the early stage of gentrification are characterized by disinvestment and are
populated by residents who earn low incomes and often are also Black and Hispanic. Conversely,
neighborhoods in the late stage of gentrification experience increased capital investment as well

Agbai

9

as an influx of whites and those of higher socioeconomic status (Hwang and Sampson 2014;
Wyly and Hammel 2004). The health of those who live in a neighborhood for many years as it
moves from the early to late stages of gentrification may differ substantially from those who
reside in these neighborhoods for shorter time periods. Longtime residents may experience
whatever negative effects that come from living in a more disinvested neighborhood in the early
stages of gentrification, as well as any stress and social network fracturing that may occur during
the longer term. By the late stage of gentrification, these same residents may also reap the
benefits of neighborhood upgrades that come at this stage.
Conversely, those who live in gentrifying neighborhoods for short periods of time
experience only one stage, or parts of multiple stages, and the associated health effects. For
instance, those living in a neighborhood for just a few years during the early stage of
gentrification would not experience the full range of residential contexts that comes with living
in a gentrifying neighborhood for many years. Consequently, these individuals may experience
different health outcomes than those who live in gentrifying neighborhoods for long periods of
time and were therefore exposed to a wider range of neighborhood characteristics. Those who
remain in gentrifying neighborhoods as they transition present an interesting group because they
have experienced the longest duration of exposure to gentrification. These longtime residents
may experience both the positive health effects of increased neighborhood amenities and reduced
homicides, in addition to the negative impact of a reduced sense of community, stress, and higher
incidence of burglary. Looking specifically at duration of exposure to gentrification provides
insight into the extent of neighborhood change that an individual has experienced. Because
gentrification provides a range of residential contexts in a relatively short period of time, it is

Agbai

10

important to take into account not only whether one has experienced gentrification, but for how
long.
Extant literature sets up a conflicting set of hypotheses concerning how health may
change as individuals live in gentrifying neighborhoods for longer durations. On the one hand,
fracturing social networks, stress concerning displacement, and increased policing of Black and
Hispanic residents may result in declining health with greater duration of exposure to
gentrification. Conversely, repairs to the built environment, lower rates of homicide, and greater
access to neighborhood amenities may be linked to greater physical and mental health.
Though a large body of work explores how neighborhoods affect individuals when the
residential context is relatively stable, much less is known about how the simultaneous and
relatively rapid transitions that characterize gentrification are linked to individual-level health. In
this study, I endeavor to not only demonstrate the link between gentrification and health, but also
to explore how this relationship changes with time. Drawing on detailed longitudinal data and
residential histories of nearly 2,000 adults sampled in the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood
Survey, I ask, (1) how is duration of exposure to gentrification linked to the self-reported health
of those who remain in the neighborhood? (2) How does this relationship vary for members of
different racial and ethnic groups?
3. LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS A CASE OF GENTRIFICATION
Los Angeles (LA) County provides an important case study of gentrification for three
reasons. First, LA County is diverse, as nearly half of its residents identify as Hispanic. NonHispanic whites account for 26 percent of the population, 15 percent are Asian, and 9 percent are
Black (U.S. Census Bureau 2018). Because Hispanics are the second fastest-growing ethnic
group in the country after Asians (Colby and Ortman 2015), Los Angeles-based research

Agbai

11

provides important insight into the racial dynamics of gentrification in a city with significant
racial diversity. Second, while cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago are the focus of
many gentrification studies (Ding, Hwang, and Divringi 2016; Gibbons and Barton 2016;
Gibbons et al. 2019; Mary Huynh and Maroko 2014; Hwang and Sampson 2014; Timberlake and
Johns-Wolfe 2016), fewer works focus on locations like Los Angeles (Izenberg et al. 2018).
Gentrification in Los Angeles may be distinct from gentrification in east coast and midwestern
cities like New York and Chicago because of the large proportion of single-family homes and its
geographically sprawling metropolitan area (Chiland 2018; Woetzel et al. 2019). As a result,
studying Los Angeles diversifies our understanding of urban environments and may also
generate findings that are applicable to relatively similar cities, such as Phoenix and Houston.
Third, LA County has been in the throes of an affordable housing crisis for decades.
Affordable housing options have declined since the 1990s as federal and local governments have
increasingly relied upon the private sector to provide housing for the poor and working class.
This, in combination with homeowner opposition to the construction of multi-family units in
neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes, has contributed to the affordable housing shortage
that has worsened in Los Angeles throughout the 21st century (Davis 2006). Nearly 60 percent of
renters in LA cannot afford their rent (Barragan 2015), and the median home price has nearly
tripled between 1970 and 2018 (Khouri 2018). A shortage of affordable housing is linked to
gentrification because the lack of affordable homes puts pressure on not only those who earn low
incomes, but also on the middle- and upper-middle classes. As housing becomes increasingly
expensive, those who earn higher incomes look to lower-income neighborhoods, contributing to
the process of gentrification. Though the lack of affordable housing is particularly severe in Los
Angeles, it is not a problem unique to this metropolitan area. In cities across the country, the lack

Agbai

12

of affordable housing is becoming increasingly dire, as increases in the cost of rent have
outpaced income growth since 2001 (Currier et al. 2018). Exploring how gentrification unfolds
in Los Angeles County will provide important insights for metropolitan areas that are
experiencing the effects of their own local affordable housing crises. For these reasons, Los
Angeles provides an important case study for understanding how the health of residents in
gentrifying neighborhoods unfolds over time.

4. DATA AND METHODS
4.1 Data
Data for this study come from two sources. The first is the Los Angeles Family and
Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), which provides longitudinal data on individuals and
families. Enumerated by the RAND corporation, L.A.FANS is a multilevel survey that employs
a stratified sampling strategy to sample neighborhoods, block groups within neighborhoods,
families within blocks, and children and adults within families. This survey employs a stratified
sampling design in an effort to oversample poor and very poor neighborhoods and families with
children in Los Angeles County. The survey, however, includes neighborhoods across the
income distribution. L.A.FANS collects detailed longitudinal data on neighborhoods, families,
children, residential choice, and neighborhood change. The first wave of responses was collected
between 2000 and 2002 and the second between 2006 and 2008. The focus of this analysis is the
adults sampled in this survey.
One important element of the restricted version of the L.A.FANS is the geocoded
residential history calendar. This residential history details respondents’ census tracts of
residence for each year beginning from as far back as 1990 (Sastry et al. 2006). Although

Agbai

13

residential histories require recall, and therefore may introduce measurement error, this approach
is widely employed (Desmond, Gershenson, and Kiviat 2015; Frank and Bjornstrom 2011;
Rosenblatt and Cossyleon 2018; Sharkey and Elwert 2011) and provides important insight into
the total number and location of neighborhoods in which respondents have resided.
The response rate in the portion of the L.A.FANS in which adults provide information
about themselves and their households is 89 percent (Sastry et al. 2006). Of those who do
respond to the survey, 9 percent of observations are missing. Rather than drop individuals with
missing observations, I use multiple imputation (10 imputations performed in Stata 14), which
uses chained equations to iteratively estimate missing values in both independent and dependent
variables. This method is particularly well-suited to this analysis because it accommodates
arbitrary missing-value patterns (Allison 2002; White, Royston, and Wood 2011). Because of the
particularity of Los Angeles neighborhoods however, I do not impute missing census tracts in the
residential histories. Results hold when analyses are performed on unimputed data, however.2
The final sample includes adults who completed the residential history calendar at wave 1
(N=1,141) and wave 2 (N=2,024).
The second data source that this study draws upon is data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Specifically, I employ decennial census data from 1990, 2000, and 2010 from the Longitudinal
Tract Database (Logan, Xu, and Stults 2014). Although the L.A.FANS lists the census tracts
where respondents have resided, it does not provide detailed characteristics of the tracts. The
Census data, therefore, provide insight into the sociodemographic composition of the
neighborhoods that LA.FANS respondents list in their residential histories. These tract-level
characteristics provide the basis for the measure of gentrification applied in this analysis, which
is discussed in greater detail in the Measures section. I deploy linear interpolation to estimate

Agbai

14

tract characteristics in non-census years (Crowder and South 2008; Warner 2016). Gentrification
researchers often employ decennial census data and/or ACS estimates alone as important
elements of their gentrification measures (Ellen and O’Regan 2011; Martin and Beck 2016;
Timberlake and Johns-Wolfe 2016). However, the use of linear interpolation more dynamically
captures this process of neighborhood change and allows me to measure the number of years an
individual has experienced gentrification.
To account for changes in census tract boundaries that often occur from one census to the
next, I use census data standardized to 1990 boundaries from the Longitudinal Tract Database
(Logan, Xu, and Stults 2014). Like many urban scholars, I use the census tract as a measure of
the neighborhood. Census tracts typically include between 2,500 and 8,000 individuals. The U.S.
Census Bureau employs local history and insights from local officials in an effort to construct
census tracts that effectively approximate neighborhood boundaries (White 1987). Although the
census tract is an imperfect representation of the neighborhood, in Los Angeles, census tracts are
moderately sized, with approximately 5,600 residents per tract. Los Angeles tracts are also
geographically compact, and undivided by large geographic boundaries, such as highways, large
boulevards, and parks (Sastry et al. 2006:1009).
4.2 Measures
4.2.1 Self-reported health
The outcome variable in this analysis is overall, self-reported health. Respondents are
asked, “what is your health in general?” in both waves of the survey. This measure of selfreported health is ordinal, and responses fall into one of five categories: 1= poor, 2 = fair, 3 =
good, 4 = very good, and 5 = excellent. This kind of self-reported health data is widely used
among social scientists (Browning and Cagney 2002; Gibbons 2019; Izenberg et al. 2018),

Agbai

15

reliable over time, and has been found to accurately reflect morbidity and mortality, as well as
the mental health of respondents (Ferraro and Farmer 1999; Idler and Benyamini 1997).
Capturing both mental and physical health is important in a study of gentrification and health
because, as is highlighted elsewhere in this paper, gentrification may be related to both
categories of health outcomes.
4.2.2 Gentrification
The primary independent variable is the total number of years a respondent has lived in a
gentrifying census tract by waves 1 and 2. In this analysis, a tract is said to be experiencing
gentrification during a given year if it meets two criteria. First, the census tract must be
“gentrifiable,” meaning that its median household income and percent of residents age 25 and
older with a college degree were both below their respective medians in Los Angeles County in
1990 (Ding et al. 2016; Gibbons and Barton 2016; Hammel and Wyly 1996; J. Hwang and
Sampson 2014). This “threshold” requirement captures the previous disinvestment that is central
to the definition of gentrification deployed in this analysis.3 Second, I adopt Ding, Hwang, and
Divringi’s (2016) metric, which asserts that a tract is undergoing gentrification if it is (a)
gentrifiable and (b) the tract median rent and percent of those with college degrees increases by
more than the county-wide increase since the previous year. A tract is also said to be gentrifying
if it is (a) gentrifiable and (b) the median home value and percent with a college degree increased
by more than the countywide increase that year.4
This measure reflects several important elements of gentrification. First, the housing
measures capture changes in investment and amenities in the neighborhood. The use of either
increasing rents or home values also demonstrates changing levels of affordability in formerly
disinvested neighborhoods. The share of college graduates included in this measure represents an

Agbai

16

influx of those of higher socioeconomic status who may or may not initially earn high incomes
(Ding et al 2016; Freeman 2005).
The gentrification variable indicates the number of years a respondent lived in any
gentrifying tract at the time of the first and second interviews. This variable measures total
exposure to gentrification and therefore includes the total number of years a respondent has lived
in one or more gentrifying tracts.5 This measure of gentrification relies on annual increases in
tract-level variables, and therefore the first year that a tract could have experienced gentrification
is 1991. As a result, the maximum number of years of exposure to gentrification is 17 years,
between 1991 and 2008. The relationship between health and moving out of gentrifying
neighborhoods is an extremely important question, however the sample of residents who move
out of gentrifying neighborhoods is too small in the L.A. FANS to investigate in this analysis.
Because urban scholars operationalize gentrification using numerous different measures, I
explore the extent to which the results are robust to alternate ways of measuring gentrification.
Results using this alternate measure are similar in direction and magnitude.6
4.2.3 Covariates
The second important independent variable is race and ethnicity. In light of the array of
stressors Black and Hispanic residents face in gentrifying neighborhoods discussed elsewhere in
this manuscript (Anderson 1997; Freeman 2006; Logan and Molotch 1987; Sullivan and Shaw
2011; Zukin 2011), the health of residents may vary significantly by race. I therefore include a
measure of race and ethnicity in the models. Categories include non-Hispanic Black, nonHispanic white, and Hispanic. Because the number of respondents who identify as non-Hispanic
Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, and other is relatively small in the L.A.FANS, I
collapse these groups into the Asian/other category.

Agbai

17

Control measures from the L.A. FANS include individual-level educational attainment,
annual income, sex, age, and binary variables indicating marital status and presence of children
in the household. These variables are collected at 2 waves over the duration of the survey. I do
not control for tract characteristics because this would hold constant precisely the kind of
neighborhood change that this analysis seeks to capture.7
4.3 Analytic Strategy
This analysis is conducted in two parts. First, I present descriptive characteristics of the
census tracts and adults included in the L.A.FANS sample. This step illuminates the extent to
which the operationalization of gentrification applied in this analysis captures the social and
demographic shifts described in the literature. Second, I explore the extent to which changes in
duration of exposure to gentrification are linked to self-reported health. In this step, I pool
observations from both waves of the L.A.FANS to estimate individual fixed effects models. The
Hausman Test supports the use of fixed effects models over random effects. Fixed effects models
estimate how changes in the duration of exposure to gentrification are associated with changes in
health within individuals over time. One primary benefit of the fixed effects model is that it
controls for time-invariant, unobserved characteristics at the individual level, such as childhood
advantage or disadvantage and genetics, that may impact health over time. These models,
therefore, are identified from variation within individuals across waves. Controlling unobserved,
fixed characteristics that may predict health reduces the omitted variables bias that regularly
plagues OLS. Although this analysis controls for fixed, unobserved characteristics of individuals,
it cannot control for unobserved, time-varying, individual-level variables that may be associated
with both health and gentrification. For example, as the tract undergoes change, residents may
become more or less likely to walk outside. This change in behavior in gentrifying

Agbai

neighborhoods may have important ramifications for health (Allison 2009). This model is
summarized in Equation 1,

!!"# = $$ + $% &'()!"# + $& &'()!"# * +,-'!"# + $' .(/010/2,3!"# + 2!"# + 4! ,

(1)

where for each individual i in census tract j during wave t, I model health (Y) as a function of the
total number of years an individual has resided in a gentrifying tract (Gent); an individual’s race
(Race); the interaction between the duration of exposure to gentrification and race (Gent x Race);
and individual-level covariates (Individual). The individual-level error term is u.8
The individual-level fixed effect (4) holds constant the characteristics of individuals that do
not vary over time, such as race and sex. Therefore, the main effects of race and sex have been
differenced out of this interaction model, but the interaction between race and duration of
exposure to gentrification remains (Gent x Race). The duration of gentrification measure and
remaining covariates included in .(/010/2,3 vary enough from wave 1 to wave 2 to be included
in this fixed effects model.9 This analysis makes use of the survey weights provided by
LA.FANS.
5. RESULTS
5.1 Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the census tracts in which L.A. FANS residents
reside for the years between 199210 and 2008. As is customary in many studies of gentrification,
I have divided the descriptive statistics into 3 categories: gentrifying, gentrifiable, and not
gentrifiable (Ding et al. 2016; Hammel and Wyly 1996; Timberlake and Johns-Wolfe 2016). The
gentrifying category includes tracts that are found to be gentrifying as defined above.

Gentrifiable tracts are those that met the disinvestment threshold of gentrifiability in 1990, but
were not gentrifying. Non-gentrifying tracts are those that are were not gentrifiable and were not
gentrifying in the given year.

Many of the observed tract-level changes in Table 1 align well with existing literature on
gentrification. For instance, by 2008 median rent in gentrifying tracts had more than doubled.11
Similarly, median home value in gentrifying tracts increases by 142 percent, while it increased
by much less in gentrifiable (45 percent) and non-gentrifying tracts (72 percent). Moreover, the
share of college-educated more than doubles in this period and the percent of white residents
increases by 74 percent, far outpacing other tracts. This influx of white residents aligns with
findings from New York City, which demonstrate that incoming residents to gentrifying
neighborhoods are disproportionately white (Sutton 2018). Household income remained flat in
gentrifying neighborhoods while it fell in gentrifiable (-16 percent) and non-gentrifying (-12
percent) tracts. Interestingly, the share of Black residents declines in all tracts, and declines the
most in gentrifiable tracts (-45 percent). Conversely, the percent of Hispanics remains flat in
gentrifying tracts, while it rises in others. These descriptive characteristics demonstrate that the
measure of gentrification employed in this analysis captures many of the key elements of this
process of neighborhood transition described in the literature.
Table 2 presents individual-level descriptive statistics of LA FANS respondents by wave
in gentrifying, gentrifiable, and non-gentrifying tracts. Between waves 1 and 2, the health of
residents in gentrifying and gentrifiable neighborhoods increased roughly equally, by nearly 7
percent. Health in non-gentrifying neighborhoods remained flat over time, however. In wave 1,
residents living in gentrifying tracts had lived in a neighborhood experiencing gentrification
during any point in their residential histories for an average of 3 years. By wave 2, the average
for this group had risen to nearly 7 years.

In a similar manner to the tract-level characteristics in Table 1, many of the trends at the
individual level align well with the literature on gentrifying neighborhoods. The share of
Hispanic residents in gentrifying neighborhoods declines by nearly 11 percent, while it increases
by 4 percent and 16 percent in gentrifiable and non-gentrifying tracts, respectively. The
percentage of white residents in tracts experiencing gentrification increases by a factor of 3,
while it declines in gentrifiable (-19 percent) and non-gentrifying tracts (-13 percent).
Interestingly, the percent of Black L.A. FANS respondents increased the most in gentrifying
neighborhoods (58 percent), followed by gentrifying tracts(8 percent), and it declined in
gentrifiable tracts by 13 percent. The percentage of residents with a college degree increases the
most in gentrifying tracts at 43 percent, followed by gentrifiable tracts (5 percent). It declines by
16 percent in non-gentrifying tracts during this time period. Finally, L.A. FANS respondents in
gentrifying tracts experience the greatest rise in income (26 percent), followed by gentrifiable
(19 percent) and non-gentrifying neighborhoods (-11 percent). Moving is generally infrequent
among all residents, as the total number of residential moves does not exceed 0.5 in all
neighborhoods by wave 2.
5.2 Changes in Duration of Exposure to Gentrification
Table 3 presents estimates of the extent to which the health of individuals changes as they
experience gentrification for longer durations. Model 1 of Table 3 indicates that each additional
year of residence in a gentrifying tract is associated with a 0.04-point increase in health. The
average length of residence in a gentrifying neighborhood for residents currently residing in a
tract undergoing this form of neighborhood change is nearly 7 years by wave 2. This means that
individuals who have resided in gentrifying tracts for this length of time can expect to see more
than a quarter of a point increase in self-rated health (0.04*7 = 0.28). These results indicate that

24

the neighborhood upgrades and increased access to neighborhood resources and amenities are
associated with better health for residents. Model 2 interacts duration of gentrification with race,
and the link between duration of exposure to gentrification and health does not vary across racial
and ethnic groups as hypothesized.12 Results using unimputed data are similar in magnitude and
direction.13

Figure 1 presents predicted values of self-reported health based on Model 1 of Table 3.
As is indicated in Table 3, each additional year of gentrification is associated with increased selfreported health in the full sample. The predicted self-reported health for those with 1 year of
exposure to gentrification is just under 3.5 on a 5-point scale. By 7 years of exposure to
gentrification, the average duration for residents currently residing in a gentrifying tract by wave
2, self- reported health rises to 3.7. This within-person increase in health over time with
additional years of exposure to gentrification occurs even after controlling for age, which is
associated with declining health. In sum, this figure provides further support for the hypothesis
that the increased neighborhood amenities and declines in certain kinds of crime associated with
gentrification is associated with better health.
Because the residents of gentrifying neighborhoods become more white and earn higher
incomes over time as demonstrated in Table 2, it may appear that results simply reflect the better
health outcomes that these more advantaged groups have been found to experience. Table 2
demonstrates that by wave 2, residents of gentrifying neighborhoods have resided in tracts
undergoing this kind of change for an average of 7 years. Moreover, residents of gentrifying
tracts move about as little as residents in non-gentrifying tracts, at 0.4 and 0.5 total moves
respectively by wave 2. The relatively lengthy residence of residents in gentrifying
neighborhoods, coupled with low levels of residential mobility among those in both gentrifying
and non-gentrifying neighborhoods alike, provides further evidence that the observed health

Agbai

26

gains that accompany residence in a gentrifying neighborhood are not simply an artifact of
demographic shifts in these neighborhoods.

Figure 1: Duration of Gentrification and Self-reported Health (95% Confidence Intervals)

Figure plots predicted self-reported health from Table 3, Model 1, using individuallevel fixed effects and all control variables. Estimates are based on both waves of
L.A.FANS and U.S. Census data from 1990 to 2010.

6. ROBUSTNESS CHECK: NEIGHBORHOOD STABILITY AND HEALTH
In an effort to ensure that the observed relationship between duration of exposure to
gentrification and increased health is not a spurious one related to the positive effects of
remaining in a neighborhood for long periods of time, I explore the relationship between
duration of exposure to stable, low-SES neighborhoods and self-reported health. I use stable lowSES neighborhoods, rather than stable middle- or high-SES neighborhoods, primarily because
extant research finds that residence in more affluent neighborhood is linked with greater self-

Agbai

27

rated health (Browning et al. 2003; Wen et al. 2003). Testing the link between remaining in a
stable neighborhood and health is also preferable to analyzing the health of residents in declining
tracts, largely because if the neighborhood is experiencing decline on a number of dimensions,
there may also be forces at play within the neighborhood that are negatively linked to health.
This would confound any observed association between remaining in a declining neighborhood
and health. For these reasons, I look specifically at stable neighborhoods that are most similar to
the ones that eventually gentrify. Low-SES, stable tracts are defined as those that (a) are not
gentrifying, and (b) remain in the bottom 3 deciles of rent and percent of people with a college
degree, or they remain in the bottom 3 deciles of income and college graduates during each year
from 1990 to 2008.14

Table 4 presents estimates of the relationship between duration of residence in a stably
low-income census tract. Results indicate that the link between duration of residence in a lowSES, stable neighborhood and self-reported health is not statistically significant. This finding
provides further support for the robustness of the positive relationship between duration of
exposure to gentrification and health described in the primary analysis.
7. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Gentrification is often presented as a solution to urban problems ranging from depleted
tax bases to street crime. Although gentrification has been promoted as a remedy to many of the
issues that ail cities, several questions remain concerning how this process of neighborhood
change is related to the health of residents. In this analysis, I have asked two questions. First,
how is duration of exposure to gentrification linked to the self-reported health of those who
remain in the neighborhood? Second, how does this relationship vary for members of different
racial and ethnic groups? Results indicate that living in a gentrifying neighborhood for longer
percids of time is associated with better self-reported health. This relationship does not vary by

Agbai

29

race or ethnicity. These results support the hypothesis that a longer duration of residence in a
gentrifying neighborhood is associated with greater health as a result of repairs to the built
environment, lower rates of homicide, and greater access to neighborhood amenities.
These findings broadly align with extant literature, which finds either a positive
association between gentrification and health (Gibbons and Barton 2016) or the absence of a
negative relationship (Mary Huynh and Maroko 2014; Izenberg et al. 2018) in the full sample.
Because the findings of the present paper are similar to the small but growing literature
investigating the relationship between gentrification and health, this suggests that despite the
distinct nature of Los Angeles in terms of housing stock and density, the results presented here
can be generalized to other major east coast cities with caution.
This study is not without limitations. First, the number of people who move out of
gentrifying neighborhoods is small in the L.A. FANS, making it difficult to explore the relationship
between gentrification and health within this subsample of movers. Second, this analysis relies on
data from Los Angeles County. While this setting is a useful case for examining gentrification –
due to the rapid changes in L.A. neighborhoods, the diversity of residents, and its ongoing housing
shortage – future research should explore other localities, or perhaps employ a large national
sample, to better understand how these dynamics play out more broadly. Finally, although this
analysis controls for fixed, unobserved characteristics of individuals over time, it cannot control
for time-varying individual-level variables that may be associated with both health and
gentrification. Results are therefore correlational.
This work makes important empirical and theoretical contributions to the literature
concerned with Urban Sociology. First, this study makes an empirical contribution to the
neighborhood effects literature. Urban scholars have long argued that the research on

Agbai

30

neighborhood effects should take seriously how the demographic composition of individuals in a
neighborhood, rather than the broader residential context, may contribute to individual-level
outcomes for residents (Sampson and Sharkey 2008). The present study addresses the issue of
neighborhood selection by deploying duration of exposure to gentrification, rather than
contemporaneous residence in a transitioning neighborhood alone. Moreover, the use of
longitudinal data at the individual and tract level allows for unchanging, unobserved
characteristics of individuals to be held constant. Though results do not fully account for
selection into neighborhoods, this approach is an improvement over cross-sectional
neighborhood analyses.
Second, these findings have important theoretical implications, as they provide further
insight into Lefebvre’s (1991) concept of “social space.” Gentrification provides an example of
not only the role of space in reproducing the social hierarchy, but also how a reversal of spatial
power relations from the suburbs to central cities can benefit the health of longtime, more
disadvantaged residents. The increase in power concentrated in gentrifying neighborhoods
manifests in the form of upgrades to the built environment, increased neighborhood investment,
an influx of services and healthier food stores, and declines in certain kinds of violent crime
(Anguelovski 2015; Ellen et al. 2001; Papachristos et al. 2011). Although longtime residents of
gentrifying neighborhoods are more disadvantaged, their health benefits from the power that is
increasingly concentrated in their neighborhoods as they gentrify. Conceptualizing gentrification
as an example of shifting spatial power relations gives rise to questions that should be taken up
in future research. For instance, as power shifts away from a well-resourced neighborhood and it
experiences decline, how does this impact the health of long-time residents? In addition, future

Agbai

31

research should delve more deeply into the lived experiences of long-time residents, as both the
boundaries and composition of the neighborhood changes over time.
Although duration of exposure to gentrification is positively linked to the health of
residents who are able to stay in these neighborhoods, this does not mean that the same is true of
movers. The sample of residents who move out of gentrifying neighborhoods in this analysis is
too small to explore using a regression framework. Future research should take up this issue and
investigate the relationship between displacement from a gentrifying neighborhood and health.
The results of this study are not an endorsement of the use of gentrification as a public
health intervention. Gentrification is also associated with social, physical, and institutional
displacement, as well as heightened class-based and racial tensions (Anderson 1997:199;
Freeman 2006; Gibbons et al. 2019; Hicken et al. 2018; Logan and Molotch 1987; Sullivan and
Shaw 2011; Zukin 2011). Instead, findings reiterate the importance of neighborhood investments
for the health and well-being of their residents. The results presented here suggest that if
longtime residents are to reap the health benefits of the neighborhood improvements that
accompany gentrification, efforts must be made to allow these residents to remain in their
neighborhoods as they undergo change. Rather than promoting pro-gentrification policies,
legislators should work with communities to make the kinds of investments and attract the kinds
of businesses that community members want, while working to prevent the social and physical
displacement of the most disadvantaged residents.

I use the term “Hispanic” to refer to Latinx communities throughout this paper to maintain

consistency with Census categories.

See Appendix C

I employ 1990 as the threshold of gentrifiability for two important reasons. First, the residential

history for many residents begins in 1998. As a result, the 1990 threshold captures an element of
historic disinvestment in the neighborhood. Second, the use of a threshold that is several years
before the beginning of the residential history, rather than a more contemporaneous measure,
requires fewer assumptions concerning the speed at which gentrification takes place. If, for
instance, gentrifiability were based upon disinvestment in the previous year, this assumes that
gentrification can occur extremely rapidly. The preponderance of gentrification research,
however, demonstrates that this process of neighborhood change occurs at a slower pace than
this.
4

Because this measure of gentrification relies on census data, I cannot be certain whether

neighborhood increases in college attendance, income, and home value are different residents, or
simply the same residents who increase their socioeconomic status. Descriptive statistics later in
this paper demonstrate that the racial composition of these neighborhoods also changes
substantially, suggesting that the changes in SES that we observe are a result of changes in the
composition of residents, rather than rises in SES of long term residents.
5

In this analysis, the primary gentrification measure indicates the total number of years a

resident has lived in a gentrifying neighborhood up through their first and second interviews.
Gentrification occurs in stages, with some neighborhoods having just begun the process, and
others experiencing significant levels of capital investment and more visible demographic
Agbai

49

changes (Hwang and Sampson 2014; Wyly and Hammel 2004). As a result, it is unclear what
precisely a measure of gentrification that sums the total number of years lived in a gentrifying
tract captures. For some, the duration measure indicates that an individual has lived in the same
gentrifying tract for many years, experiencing the beginning through the late stages of
gentrification. For others, the duration measure may capture residence in multiple tracts during
the same beginning stage of gentrification.
The correlation between duration of exposure to gentrification and total number of times
an individual has moved gives some insight into this question of the extent to which duration of
exposure should be employed as a proxy for the range of stages of gentrification an individual
has experienced. A high correlation between years of exposure to gentrification and total moves
would suggest that the greater the number of years in a gentrifying tract, the greater the number
of different tracts in which the respondent has lived. Conversely, a low correlation indicates that
respondents are more likely to have been exposed to all of their years of gentrification in one
neighborhood. The minuscule correlation between duration of gentrification and total moves
(0.0485) provides some justification for the use of duration of exposure as a proxy for
experience with a broad array of stages of gentrification in a particular census tract.

Tables are available upon request.
I also perform the analysis controlling for the tract-level characteristics, and results do not differ

substantively.
8

To interrogate the extent to which the experience of stayers differs from the full sample, I also

perform this analysis on a stratified sample of stayers in robustness checks. This stratified sample
includes only those who remain in gentrifying neighborhoods throughout the duration of their

Agbai

50

residential histories. Results from this analysis do not rise to the level of statistical significance.
Tables are available upon request.
9

Appendix A presents within- and between-panel variation for the covariates included in the

analysis. This table demonstrates that, as mentioned in the Analytic Strategy section, there is no
within-panel variation for race and sex. Put differently, a respondent’s race and sex are constant
over time in this sample. There is in fact variation over time in the other variables included in the
model. For instance, the within-panel standard deviation for self-rated health is 0.5 on a 5-point
scale. Income changes by more than $8,500 on average. This table suggests that there is
significant variation within individuals over time to warrant the use of a fixed effects model.
10

Too few tracts were gentrifying in 1991 to compare to 2008. As a result, the first year of

descriptive statistics is in 1992.
11
12

All dollar amounts are in 2012 dollars.
Although the reference category for the interaction between years of exposure to

gentrification and race is whites, I also test the null hypothesis that the coefficients for Black and
Hispanic residents are equal. I fail to reject this null hypothesis at p < 0.05, indicating that the
coefficients for these 2 groups are statistically indistinguishable. I included immigrant status as a
control in other models, and this did not substantively alter results.
13

See Appendix C.

14

I perform a similar analysis in which I define stability as a tract having remained in the same

decile of rent and percent of people with a college degree, or remained in the same decile of
median household income and percentage of people with a college degree in each year between
1990 and 2008. These results were also not statistically significant.
