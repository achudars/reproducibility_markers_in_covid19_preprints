Foreign Language Anxiety: Systematic Review

Oteir & Al-Otaibi

1. Introduction
With growing concern being devoted to foreign language learning, anxiety has been ranked to
be a crucial challenge to language learners. Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, (1986) believe that anxiety
undermines the process of foreign language learning. Language researchers almost agree that
anxiety emerged from language learning process is one of the most primary obstacles that English
as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners encounter when learning a foreign language (Alrabai, 2014;
Wu, 2010). Horwitz (2001) assures that most EFL learners suffer from language anxiety in
different levels. Moreover, Horwitz and Young (1991) state the increased number of language
learners who feel anxious in their language classes is alarming. Krashen (1982) explains that
anxiety associated with a foreign language can be as barriers that prevent information to reach the
language acquisition area in a learner’s brain. Additionally, several studies were conducted on
foreign language anxiety stressed that language learners who experience anxiety in their foreign
language learning might not be enjoyable, which negatively affects the learners’ performance and
achievement (Maclntyre, 1999; Riasati, 2011). Language educators also stress that their students
experience foreign language anxiety in language classes, which negatively influences their
achievement and performance. Von Worde (2003) reports that previous research on foreign
language anxiety has systematically detected that anxiety can obstruct second/ foreign language
achievement and performance. Since anxiety causes crucial problems for EFL learners in which
can undermine their performance and achievement, it needs more research and exploration (Elaldi,
2016). This current paper gives a comprehensive literature review on foreign language anxiety. It
also discusses the theoretical models to explain the concept of language anxiety, causes of foreign
language anxiety, and effects of foreign language anxiety.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Foreign Language Anxiety
In the literature, several definitions of foreign language anxiety are available. According to
Ortega (2009), the two prominent definitions that have been enriching our knowledge of language
anxiety were proposed by Horwitz et al. (1986) and Maclntyre (1999). Horwitz et al. (1986) define
language anxiety to be “a distinct complex of self-perceptions, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors
related to classroom language learning arising from the uniqueness of the language learning
process” (p. 128). Similarly, Maclntyre (1999) describes that language anxiety as a feeling of
stress, nervousness, emotional reaction, and worry that linked to second/ foreign language
learning.
To understand foreign language anxiety in a boarder scope, the aspects of anxiety, in general,
should be discussed. Psychologically, anxiety has been categorized into three aspects: 1) trait
anxiety, 2) state anxiety, and 3) situation- specific anxiety (Speilberger, 1983). The trait
perspective occurs when a person has a permanent intent to be anxious (Scovel, 1978). It is a
general
personality trait, which does not change across several situations. Sieber, O'Neil &
Tobias (1977) claim that trait anxiety indicates to “stable personality differences in anxiety
proneness” (p. 99). This aspect of anxiety remains stable over time because it is a feature in the
personality of an individual. According to Eysenck (1979), trait anxiety can damage cognitive
functioning and interrupt memory.

Oteir & Al-Otaibi

The state perspective is defined as an emotional state. Spielberger (1972) explains the state
anxiety to be “the emotional reaction or pattern of response that occurs in an individual who
perceives a particular situation as personally dangerous or threatening, irrespective of the presence
or absence of objective danger”(p.489). The state anxiety can also be defined as a feeling of
nervousness that can change over time and fluctuate in rigor (Young, 1998). Test anxiety distinctly
exemplifies the state anxiety whereby students experience anxiety from a particular test, but this
feeling can change over time. The state anxiety affects the emotions, cognition, and behaviors of
a person.
The situation-specific perspective occurs at a particular point of time as a result to a specific
situation (Spielberger, 1983). Maclntyre and Gardner (1991) state that the situation-specific
anxiety is a unique anxiety form that happens invariably over time within a given situation. It is
closely related to specific situations in which one situation differs from another, but it is consistent
over time. Language anxiety and math anxiety are examples of situation-specific anxieties.
Language researchers believe that learning a foreign language is related to situation-specific
anxiety rather than trait anxiety because trait anxiety is a stable trait wherein all situations provoke
anxiety feeling while a situation-specific anxiety is associated with specific situations (Oxford and
Ehrman, 1992). Similarly, Maclntyre and Gardner (1991) claim that a situation-specific
perspective is the best research approach for foreign language anxiety because language learners
experience anxiety in different aspects of the situation in a language class. In sum, a situationspecific anxiety focuses on the particular forms of anxiety that occur systematically over time.
Language anxiety is also classified into two distinct types: debilitating (harmful) anxiety and
facilitating (helpful) anxiety (Alpert & Haber, 1960). A consensus of studies concentrates on
debilitating anxiety, which harms learners and impacts their performance negatively (Brown,
2007; Maclntyre, 1999; Kim, 2000, Horwitz et al, 1986; Jones, 2004; Oxford, 1999). The effects
could be direct such as reducing class participation or indirect such as fear, frustration, and worry
(Oxford, 1999). On the other hand, facilitating anxiety helps learners in a particular way to truly
perform well in the language. A few researchers have adapted facilitating anxiety, which can be a
trait to help the learners in overcoming their anxiety (Bailey, 1983; Ellis, 1994; Kleinmann, 1977).
2.2 Theories/ Models to Explain Foreign Language Anxiety
To recognize language anxiety, models or theories of second/ foreign language acquisition
provide beneficial insights into this phenomenon. The following theories of second language
acquisition are discussed: Krashen’s Affective Filter Hypothesis (1982), Horwitz, Horwitz and
Cope’s Theory of Foreign Language Anxiety.
2.2.1 Krashen’s Affective Filter Hypothesis
Krashen’s Affective Filter Hypothesis (1982) is a fundamental theory in the field of second
language acquisition. This theory stresses how affective factors associate with the second language
acquisition process. Krashen (1982) states that the affective factors are emotional variables, which
can be categorized into: 1) motivation, 2) self-confidence, 3) anxiety. These factors can indirectly
influence learning by preventing input from reaching the language acquisition device in the brain.
To be more precise, this theory explains the relationship between emotional variables and success
or failure of second language acquisition. For example, when the affective filter increases, learners

Oteir & Al-Otaibi

may experience anxiety, tension, and lack of self-confidence that prevent success. On the other
hand, low filters do not lead to anxiety, which help language learners to understand the input easily.
The importance of this hypothesis in pedagogy is that the idea of affective filter presents a language
instructor in a new way, in which the language instructors who can effectively facilitate input and
make it understandable in a low anxiety situation where an appropriate classroom environment can
be created. In other words, a language teacher can minimize the students’ anxiety by following
certain strategies such as focusing on the message, neglecting the form, and not insisting on the
early production unless the teacher feels that the students are ready. By utilizing this theory,
English is expected to be improved because input will be gained, the filter will be low, and the
learners will not be afraid to take apart in class exercises.
2.2.2 Horwitz, Horwitz and Cope’s Theory of Foreign Language Anxiety
Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986) in their popular research define foreign language anxiety
as “a distinct complex construct of self-perceptions, beliefs, feelings, and behaviours related to
classroom language learning arising from the uniqueness of language learning process” (p. 128).
They state that anxiety associated with a foreign language is a situation-specific form emerging
from the uniqueness of foreign language learning, not as a general anxiety moved to learning a
foreign language. They prove their theory by observing language learners during the process of
teaching in language classes and feedback from thirty language learners attending a language class
as well. This theory proposes that other academic fields of study do not have the same degree of
self-concepts and self-expression like foreign language learning, which makes this type of anxiety
different from other academic anxieties. Learners who perform well at other subjects experienced
anxiety when learning a foreign language. Numerous studies adopted this theory and provided a
piece of evidence to validate it. For example, nine anxiety scales were used by Maclntyre and
Gardner (1989) to test anxiety dimensions in relation with various measures of learning. They
found that foreign language anxiety is notably associated with foreign language proficiency while
the general anxiety does not relate to foreign language proficiency. Similarly, Chen and Chang
(2004) believe that foreign language anxiety is a perspective of situation-specific anxiety. In their
article, neither test characteristics nor academic learning history were found to be variables of
foreign language anxiety, which means that foreign language anxiety is a unique type of anxiety.
Those findings supported this theory that anxiety associated with foreign language learning is a
specific type of anxiety stemmed from the uniqueness of learning a foreign language.
Another major contribution of this theory was the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale
(FLCAS) to measure the levels of anxiety as evidenced by negative attitudes, subjective
perceptions, beliefs, and feelings toward foreign language classes. The FLCAS is a self-report
instrument that consists of 33 items aiming to assess a learner’s level of foreign language anxiety
and to measure whether language anxiety is a specific form to language learning or not. The
FLCAS items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale numbered from 1 to 5, which ranging from
strongly agree to strongly disagree. This scale has been widely accepted from language researchers
such as Horwitz (1991); Kim (2000); Liu (2006); MacIntyre (1988); MacIntyre & Gardner (1989).
2.3 Causes of Foreign Language Anxiety
Studies have discussed various variables concerning foreign language anxiety. Those studies
have found factors like foreign language aptitude and language skills in relation to foreign

language anxiety (Ganschow & Sparks, 1996), teachers’ belief (Cheng, Horwitz, and
Schallert,1999), students’ perceptions about foreign language proficiency (Dewaele et al., 2008),
and self-esteem (Yamini and Tahriri, 2006). Additionally, a synthesis of previous studies reveals
that various factors lead to the feeling of anxiety in learning a foreign language. Howitz et al.
(1986) stress that foreign language anxiety is caused by three factors related to performance: 1)
fear of negative evaluation, 2) communication apprehension, and 3) test anxiety. Fear of negative
evaluation is the feeling of “apprehension about others’ evaluations, avoidance of evaluative
situations, and expectation that others would evaluate oneself negatively” (Horwitz et al. 1986,
p.127). Communication apprehension can be associated with foreign language anxiety because it
is a form of situational anxieties related to interpersonal communication and oral expression
(Argaman & Abu-Rabia, 2002; Maclntyre & Gardner 1989). To be more precise, people who fear
from oral communication may feel anxious when asked to talk a foreign language as well. Foreign
language anxiety can be linked to test anxiety, which is defined as “a type of performance anxiety
stemming from a fear of failure” (Horwitz et al., 1986, p. 127).
Other causes are significant in provoking foreign language anxiety. Those causes are related to
interpersonal issues and personal characteristics, such as fear of speaking a foreign language, low
self-perceived foreign language proficiency, and low self-esteem. (Mahmoodzadeh, 2013; Young,
1991). Liu and Jackson (2008) stress fear of making mistakes, teachers’ correction of learners’
errors, and speaking in front of their teachers or peers are crucial causes of foreign language
anxiety as well. Dewaele, Petrides, and Furnham (2008) suggest that learner’s perception is an
essential cause of foreign language anxiety. Other researchers such as Bailey et al. (1999) and
Yamini and Tahriri (2006) and Young (1992) have explained that learner’s degree of self-esteem
negatively associates with foreign language anxiety. People with low self-esteem will be worried
about the way that other people think toward them, which highly increase the level of anxiety.
Besides that, teachers’ role and the learning atmosphere can also be causes of foreign language
anxiety. For example, calling on students by the teachers in language classes could provoke the
feeling of anxiety for the students. Aydin (2008) also states that the manner of correcting the
mistakes of students by teachers is another source of anxiety. Argaman and Abu-Rabia (2002)
reveal that attitudes and personalities of teachers can be indicators of foreign language anxiety. All
those causes have been supported by recent studies like Aydin (2016), Kurk (2018), Sammephet
and Wanphet (2013), and Yoon (2012).
The literature on foreign language anxiety can generally be summarized into six major causes
stemmed from three primary sources: the learner, the educator, and instructional practice. These
causes are 1) interpersonal and personal anxiety, 2) learners’ beliefs about learning a foreign
language, 3) classroom procedures, 4) employing teacher-centered method, 5) teachers’ beliefs
about language teaching, and 6) language examination (Young, 1991). More recently, Luo (2012)
believes the main sources that lead to experiencing foreign language anxiety are the classroom
atmosphere, attributes of learners, the target language, and the process of foreign language learning
itself.

2.4 Effects of Foreign Language Anxiety
Research done on foreign language anxiety has shown that anxiety associated with foreign
language has negative effects on foreign language learning (Horwitz, Tallon and Luo, 2010;
Horwitz et al., 1986; Maclntyre, 1999; Marwan, 2016). Those effects can be classified into five
main effects. First, academically, foreign language anxiety indicates to the level of language
proficiency in which experiencing high levels of foreign language anxiety lead to a poor academic
achievement. Studies have reported that a negative relationship has been found between foreign
language anxiety and academic achievement as well (Horwitz, 2001). Another academic effect is
students’ drop out. So, Bailey, Onwnegbuzie, and Daley (2003) show that high anxious students
are more probable to drop out their courses than low anxious students. Second, socially, high level anxious students are not interested in communicating with others (Price, 1991). Horwitz et
al. (2010) claim that language anxiety leads students to be unwilling to communicate in English.
Third, cognitively, foreign language anxiety can be as an affective filter that denies information
from reaching a learner’s cognitive processing system (Krashen, 1982; Maclntyre and Gardner,
1989). Fourth, affectively, since anxiety is one of the affective factors in language acquisition, it
may negatively influence the other affective factors such as motivation and attitude. Horwitz et al.
(2010) report that foreign language anxiety likely influences a student’s feeling about the study.
Liu and Huang (2011) state that anxiety is negatively associated with students’ English learning
motivation. Finally, personally, students who experience anxiety in learning a foreign language
could become miserable, worried, forgetful, sweaty, and such other symptoms.
3. Conclusion
A review of related literature on foreign language anxiety shows that foreign language anxiety
is a challenging issue in foreign language learning. However, researchers should treat this issue
systematically and offer fully understanding. A thorough understanding of causes of foreign
language anxiety would help to find ways to reduce this problem. Based on this comprehensive
review, more studies in this field are still needed to confirm previous studies on foreign language
anxiety. This study suggests research timeline was conducted up to this time. It is also noticed that
foreign language anxiety has negative effects on foreign language learning. Finally, it shows the
well-known instrument (FLCAS) that measure the level of foreign language anxiety among
language learners.
