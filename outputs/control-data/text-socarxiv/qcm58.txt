To Move Home or Move On? Investigating the Impact of Recovery Aid

on Migration Status as a Potential Tool for Disaster Risk Reduction in

the Aftermath of Volcanic Eruptions in Merapi, Indonesia

Abstract

6

Disasters are associated strongly with forced migration. Indeed, migration is a stan-

7

dard survival strategy for those facing disruptions of this kind. Such is the case with

8

Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, where a series of eruptions occurred in 2010. Mechanisms re-

9

lated to forced migration in such scenarios are fairly well understood, yet it remains

10

less clear what factors may influence return migration. Given local interest in facili-

11

tating resettlement out of hazardous areas as a means of risk reduction, our objective

12

in this study is to explore the extent to which recovery aid may create incentives for

13

households to move on rather than move home. Specifically, we explore whether the

14

influence of recovery aid varied by whether it was: financial vs. another type of aid;

15

provided by a government agency or NGO versus a social network; and/or distributed

16

with other types of recovery aid. We use data from a cross-sectional pilot study and

17

multinomial logistic regression models to explore the influence of aid on migration

18

status. Of the various forms of aid considered, financial recovery aid was consistently

19

associated with moving on. The combination of financial recovery aid with remittances

20

resulted in an association with having moved on that was even stronger than just re-

21

ceiving financial recovery aid. Ultimately, analyses of “aid packages” suggest that a

22

combination of aid was relatively more effective in fostering resettlement, suggesting

23

that while other forms of aid may not have been sufficient to increase resettlement by

24

themselves, they may enhance the effect of financial recovery aid.

Introduction

28

Between October 26th and November 5th, 2010, a series of violent volcanic eruptions

29

impacted the region surrounding Mt. Merapi in Central Java, Indonesia. Over time,

30

these eruptions culminated in repeated discharges of ash and lava, as well as the

31

formation of large eruption columns that sent several pyroclastic flows into heavily

32

populated areas located along the slopes of the volcano. The seismic activity was

33

accompanied by heavy rainfall that produced highly destructive lahars. The scale

34

of the 2010 Mt. Merapi eruptions exceeded that of the 1872 Mt. Merapi eruption,

35

previously the largest eruption on record for this volcano. Prior to the onset of these

36

eruptions, the Indonesian government raised its alert to its highest level and issued

37

evacuation orders that affected 19,000 people. In total, however, it is estimated that

38

approximately 400,000 people were displaced, 3,300 homes/buildings were destroyed,

39

and 383 people were killed.

40

Because disasters from natural hazards are associated with high risks to both life

41

and property (Hunter 2005; Cutter et al. 2003), they are often associated strongly

42

with forced migration (Fussell et al. 2010; Hugo 1996; Myers et al. 2008; Sastry and

43

Gregory 2014); either as a temporary evacuation or as a forced migration of longer

44

duration. Indeed, migration, whether temporary or permanent, is a standard survival

45

strategy for those facing disruptions of this kind (Hugo 1996). Such is the case with

46

Mt. Merapi where a major eruption occurs every 4-5 years. However, despite the well-

47

known danger, the area surrounding the mountain remains densely populated. More

48

surprisingly, it is also the site of frequent return migrations as households persist in

49

returning to their original communities once the dangers associated with an eruption

50

have subsided (Amin et al. 2018; Hidayati 2011; Rahman et al. 2016; Sontosudarmo

51

1996). Anticipating that patterns of return migration increases the risk for future

52

disaster events in the area surrounding Mt. Merapi, the Indonesian disaster manage-

53

ment agency “Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana” (BNPB) conducted a risk

54

assessment of the area and thereafter endeavored to reorganize residential areas for

55

the purpose of hazard mitigation (Hidayati 2011). With this goal in mind, the distri-

56

bution of recovery assistance to victims of the disaster was organized in part to create
2

57

incentives for households to resettle out of hazardous areas.

58

Our objective in this study is to explore the extent to which recovery aid was

59

associated with households resettling away from their original community. Drawing

60

on survey data collected from a cross-sectional pilot study in the geographic area

61

surrounding Mt. Merapi after the 2010 volcanic eruptions, we explore the extent to

62

which various forms of recovery aid were associated with migration status, particularly

63

that of respondents indicating that they had subsequently resettled or moved on.

64

Specifically, we explore whether the influence of a given type of recovery aid varied by

65

whether it was:

66

1. Financial vs. other types of aid (e.g., distribution of food)

67

2. Provided by government bodies or NGOs versus a household’s social network

68

3. Distributed in combination with other types of recovery aid as part of an “aid

69

package” that include multiple types of aid.

70

As an exploratory examination of these questions, this study contributes to the litera-

71

ture on migration in the context of disasters from natural hazards through suggesting

72

how recovery aid may influence migration decisions in this context and thereby be

73

used as a tool for future risk reduction.

74

Theoretical background

75

Migration

76

Migration, broadly defined as a permanent or semi-permanent change of residence

77

(Lee 1966), is a critical driver of demographic change (Findlay and Wahba 2013; Pre-

78

ston et al. 2000). Decisions to migrate are often conceptualized as reflecting a combi-

79

nation of push factors associated with locations of origin, pull factors associated with

80

locations of destination, and intervening obstacles that prevent or delay migration (Lee

81

1966). Recent theories on migration at the individual level are often couched within a

82

framework of rational choice that reflects the push/pull factors individuals take into

83

account, as well as intervening obstacles (DaVanzo 1980; De Jong and Fawcett 1981;

3

84

Hunter 2005; Lee 1966; Massey et al. 1993). Prominent among such frameworks is

85

the focus on economic incentives, in which a dearth of opportunities at an individ-

86

ual’s place of origin (i.e., push factors) are juxtaposed with ample opportunities in

87

potential destinations (i.e., pull factors). This is in line with findings from studies of

88

internal migration in Indonesia that found that economic factors were foremost in

89

predicting migration during the 20th century (Elmhirst 2012; Van Lottum and Marks

90

2012). Other studies have noted a pattern of internal, and often circular migration

91

within Indonesia (Czaika and Vothknecht 2014; Hugo 1982; Forbes 1981; Van Lottum

92

and Marks 2012). As noted by Lindquist (2009), these patterns are captured by the

93

verb “merantau”, which is suggestive of relocation with a somewhat vague livelihood

94

purpose while maintaining the possibility of periodic return to ones place of origin.

95

Core frameworks for return migration likewise recognize the importance of economic

96

incentives (Cassarino 2004; Stark 1991, 1996; Taylor 1996), but some also allow for

97

other factors such as geographic, social and political context to play important roles

98

(Cassarino 2004; Gardner 1981). While general migration theories provide a helpful

99

starting point, theories concerning migration in the context of disasters from natu-

100

ral hazards require further refinement. Although migrants in these contexts are still

101

seeking to maximize life outcomes, the primary goal in these situations is often the

102

maintenance of life itself. As such, the factors and mechanism at play deserve further

103

specification.

104

Disasters from natural hazards and migration

105

Understanding of migration decisions in the wake of disasters necessitates the con-

106

sideration of broader macro-level context, particularly the significance of ecological

107

pushes that encourage people to migrate (Belcher and Bates 1983; Gardner 1981;

108

Hugo 1996; Hunter 2005; Myers et al. 2008; Petersen 1958, 1975). Hugo addressed

109

these ideas and maintained that in the context of disasters, migration is probably

110

viewed best on a continuum that ranges from totally voluntary migration–in which

111

choice is the decisive element that encourages people to move–to completely forced mi-

112

gration, where the migrants are faced with death if they remain in their present place of
4

113

residence (Hugo 1996). The extent to which a migration is more or less forced depends

114

upon the severity of the hazard, perceptions of risk tied to the hazard (Nawrotzki

115

et al. 2014), and the response of macro-level actors, such as government and non-

116

governmental organizations (NGOs) (Hugo 1996; Hunter 2005; Rogers 1992). Given

117

that forced migration is by definition less voluntary compared to general migration

118

(Gray et al. 2014), some indicators that weigh heavily in general migration theory

119

(e.g., gender and age) are not always significant and other indicators (e.g., socioeco-

120

nomic status) may operate in reverse (Gray et al. 2014). This is particularly the case

121

when the severity of the disaster is such that entire populations are forced to migrate.

122

However, the more voluntary the migration, even after a disaster, the more likely it

123

will reflect the characteristics of general migrations (Hugo 1996; Hunter 2005).

124

Return migration post forced migration requires better understanding (Ruben et al.

125

2009). Consistent with general migration theory, prior studies have found that eco-

126

nomic incentives often are associated with the likelihood of return migration (Reagan

127

and Olsen 2000). Beyond economic incentives, a systematic review (Bryner et al. 2017)

128

identified the habitability of homes, access to affordable housing, financial burdens,

129

the extent of restoration of public services and facilities, and a sense of place and

130

identity as major factors influencing return migration in the aftermath of a disas-

131

ter. Fear of future disasters, stress associated with recovery, and loss of employment

132

were also influential (Bryner et al. 2017). Other research has shown that education,

133

employment, and other indicators of socioeconomic status may influence return mi-

134

gration after a disaster resulting from a natural hazard (Karimi 2017). While return

135

migrants face multiple intervening obstacles to reestablishing themselves successfully

136

in their old communities (Ruben et al. 2009), including the continued perception of

137

risk associated with the previous disaster (Nawrotzki et al. 2014), recovery aid in the

138

aftermath of the disaster may help mitigate various obstacles to returning home; e.g.,

139

helping to improve the habitability of damaged homes, restoring public services and

140

facilities, or to relieve stress associated with the disaster.

5

141

Recovery aid and migration status

142

In the context of disasters, governments and NGOs have the potential to act as

143

intervening agents that either inhibit or facilitate migration, both by creating policies

144

concerning return migration (Rogers 1992), and by the extent to which they offer aid

145

to help return migrants reestablish themselves (Ruben et al. 2009). Herein we opt to

146

focus on the effects of recovery aid on migration.

147

Federal and international aid can be an incentive for households to remain in their

148

localities rather than migrate away from disaster-prone areas (Boustan et al. 2012). Af-

149

ter a tornado struck North-Central Bangladesh in 1996, decisions to remain in original

150

communities were strongly affected by recovery aid resulting in minimal outmigration

151

(Paul 1998). Likewise, after another tornado in 2004, the vast majority of people af-

152

fected by the disaster still chose to remain in the area (Paul 2005). For the most part,

153

recovery aid from government agencies and NGOs in these instances was distributed

154

to households in an equitable manner and surpassed the cost of the damages suffered,

155

thus encouraging those affected by the tornadoes to remain in their communities (Paul

156

2005). Similarly, aid packages were offered as incentives to households and businesses

157

in an effort to curb outmigration after a series of earthquakes hit Christchurch, New

158

Zealand between 2010-2011. The vast majority of businesses and organizations chose

159

to remain in Christchurch rather than relocate (Stevenson et al. 2011, 2012). These

160

examples indicate that post-disaster aid can create incentives for people to stay in

161

their original communities. Sometimes aid does not act as an incentive to resettle, and

162

can delay recovery processes. Households affected by the 2004 tsunami in Thailand

163

received an adequate amount of aid, but still had a slow recovery (Willroth et al.

164

2011). Researchers believe recovery was stalled due to a excess of organizations and

165

participants in the recovery process and a lack of coordination between them (Willroth

166

et al. 2011).

167

Alternatively, recovery aid has also succeeded as a tool for encouraging outmigra-

168

tion from hazardous areas. After massive flooding hit Malaysia, relocation plans were

169

designed to encourage people to move out of flood-prone areas (Weng Chan 1995). Be-

170

cause of the high cost of migration, rural peasants were unlikely to migrate if aid was
6

171

not guaranteed. If aid was guaranteed in the form of a job, home, and/or lands outside

172

of their communities and outside the disaster zone, the people from affected regions

173

were highly likely to migrate (Weng Chan 1995). However, because a large number

174

of people were effected by floods, the government was unable to supply enough aid

175

to encourage everyone to leave the hazardous peninsula, resulting in minimal migra-

176

tion (Weng Chan 1995). Additionally, a study done on settlement abandonment in

177

Montserrat after a volcanic eruption examined migration and noted that rebuilding

178

and relocation would not have been possible without financial aid from the UK gov-

179

ernment (McLeman 2011). For half of the island population, the aid offered by the UK

180

encouraged them to relocate off the island (Rozdilsky 2001). Of those individuals that

181

chose to migrate, approximately half relocated to other Caribbean islands and half re-

182

settled to Great Britain (Rozdilsky 2001). Thus, aid packages have in some instances

183

been used successfully to encourage people to leave their residence.

184

Resettlement after a disaster in a developing country can be temporary, especially

185

if resettlement areas are not created with culturally sensitive and community centered

186

designs and processes (Pasupuleti 2013; Huda et al. 2007). Post-disaster resettlement is

187

approached two ways–either top down or bottom up (Oktari et al. 2017), and success-

188

ful resettlement involves coordination between multiple stakeholder and community

189

members (Huda et al. 2007). For example, a study examining the resettlement of

190

two fishing villages in Tamilnadu, India, found that housing design, location, cluster-

191

ing, allocation process, distance from previous town, and public space allocation all

192

impacted resettlement success. To avoid temporary resettlement, local needs of ac-

193

cessibility, family typology, proximity to livelihood, and creation of intentional public

194

space with landmarks should be addressed (Pasupuleti 2013). Another study found

195

that when deciding whether to relocate or move back, tsunami risk was only a minor

196

concern for displaced Indonesians; concerns about costs of rent, land prices, and dis-

197

tance from work were most pressing (Oktari et al. 2017). Thus, often times for people

198

who experience disaster in a developing country, resettlement is only temporary as

199

other livelihood needs lead people to abandon inadequate resettlement places.

200

Recovery aid may encourage outmigration when it is slow to reach geographically

7

201

isolated locations. In Kenya and Somalia, rural and pastoral victims of drought mi-

202

grated towards towns and city centers because these locations offered food aid and a

203

chance to diversify their livelihood, protecting them from future disasters (Little et al.

204

2001). Along the same lines, when post-disaster recovery is lacking nationwide, people

205

tend to migrate towards cities. In Ethiopia during times of food shortages, households

206

did not have access to needed aid (Ezra and Kiros 2001). Family members choose

207

to migrate to cities and towns where income was higher and job opportunities were

208

more abundant (Ezra and Kiros 2001). Additionally, after the earthquake-avalanche

209

in 1970 in Peru, rather than provide loans to rebuild homes, the government chose to

210

build temporary houses and distribute them on a first come first serve basis (Oliver-

211

Smith 1990). The temporary housing, as well as the higher wages promised by the

212

reconstruction committee, attracted increased rural migration. Rural peasant migra-

213

tion continued to city areas where aid was provided even after permanent housing was

214

established and rural non-homeowners were given lowest priority (first, second, and

215

third priority going to landowners and renters) (Oliver-Smith 1990).

216

The findings from these studies suggest that recovery aid can successfully function

217

as a tool for influencing migration decisions, both for increasing probability of return

218

migration as well as for outmigration, depending on how it is organized and distributed.

219

This is particularly the case for cash transfers and other forms of financial recovery

220

aid.

221

Financial recover aid: evidence of efficacy

222

Cash transfers and other forms of financial recovery aid can be effective forms of

223

recovery aid in general, as it can help people meet their immediate needs in the wake

224

of a disaster or crisis (Bailey and Harvey 2015; Johnson and Krishnamurthy 2010).

225

Studies evaluating the relative efficacy of cash based recovery aid indicate that these

226

interventions can, under the proper circumstances, effectively achieve a wide range of

227

objectives; e.g., improving access to food and thereby helping families smooth con-

228

sumption patterns, improving access to shelter, and reducing the extent to which

229

families rely upon negative coping strategies during a crisis (e.g., dietary restriction

8

230

or child labor) (Bailey and Harvey 2015; Bolton 2016). However, its relative efficacy is

231

context specific and depends upon the type of financial aid, its relative value, who are

232

the targeted recipients, how the recovery aid intervention is organized, and ultimately

233

the effectiveness of implementing the intervention (Bailey and Harvey 2015; Bolton

234

2016; Hoddinott et al. 2013; Johnson and Krishnamurthy 2010; Pozarny 2016). More-

235

over, it depends upon broader contexts such as the continued presence of markets in

236

which the financial aid can be used to obtain a variety of goods or services.

237

Perhaps the greatest advantage of financial recovery aid is that it is a flexible tool

238

for improving the welfare of individuals and households that empowers them to meet

239

their specific needs based upon their own assessment of what those needs are at the

240

time (Bailey and Harvey 2015; Bolton 2016; Johnson and Krishnamurthy 2010). As

241

Johnson and Krishnamurthy (2010) highlight, “Extending the freedom to choose puts

242

critical decisions about household needs and investments squarely in the hands of the

243

household, whose members are in theory best placed to assess the needs that are most

244

pressing at a particular point in time (e.g. consumption smoothing in order to invest in

245

fodder for livestock).” The downside to this increased autonomy is the loss of control on

246

the part of the providing agency or organization over how the financial assets are used,

247

thus the increased popularity of “conditional cash transfers” that stipulate specific

248

behavioral requirements that must be met to qualify for the assistance (Johnson and

249

Krishnamurthy 2010). One possible application of such conditions is to facilitate the

250

resettlement of individuals and households out of hazardous areas.

251

In their review of evidence concerning the efficacy of social protection programs

252

to facilitate resilience to disaster, Johnson and Krishnamurthy (2010, 653) outline

253

seven mechanisms through which cash based social protection programs may facili-

254

tate migration. Of the seven proposed mechanisms, four are likely applicable to the

255

present study. First, these program may facilitate migrants in connecting with new

256

labor markets that are reliable and sustainable alternatives to those in their sending

257

communities–this is a particularly powerful mechanism for the present study consider-

258

ing the role of place attachment in the pattern of return migration in the Mt. Merapi

259

area. Second, these programs can help offset the opportunity costs of relocation such

9

260

as compensation for assets and incomes lost as a result of resettlement. Third, financial

261

recovery aid interventions can subsidize the actual costs of relocation; i.e., “cash and

262

conditional cash transfers can be used to cover relevant costs of moving family mem-

263

bers and household possessions...” (Johnson and Krishnamurthy 2010, 653). Finally,

264

these programs can support the broader social networks, such as the communities and

265

local authorities tasked with receiving and resettling the displaced migrants.

266

Migration in context: Geography, ethnicity, and recovery aid

267

Mt. Merapi is located in the central region of Java, Indonesia, the most highly

268

populated island on the planet, with an average population density of 1000 persons

269

per square kilometer (see Figure 1). Of interest to this investigation, the population

270

density within a 15 kilometer radius of Mt. Merapi ranges from 0 to 5000 per square

271

kilometer. Within this geographic area, roughly 98% of the population are ethnic

272

Javanese (Suryadinata et al. 2003). A common Javanese proverb, ‘Sedumuk batuk

273

senyari bumi’, is interpreted to mean that ‘dignity and land are things to strive for’.

274

The proverb highlights the place attachment that Javanese people have to their land

275

and community.

Figure 1. Mt. Merapi, Indonesia. Located in Central Java province and the Special Region of Yogyakarta.

276

This attachment has been highlighted as part of the explanation for some Merapi
10

277

residents choosing to return to their original villages despite the well known risks

278

associated with living on the slopes of the volcano (Hidayati 2011; Rahman et al.

279

2016). In line with this, past studies have documented multiple area in Indonesia

280

where residents, in spite of well-documented risks and official relocation policies, are

281

reluctant to move (Amin et al. 2018; Napsiah et al. 2016; Sontosudarmo 1996; Sukamto

282

2016). Of particular note to our study, Sontosudarmo (1996) and Amin et al. (2018)

283

have showed that, though threatened by the eruption of Mt. Merapi that takes place

284

periodically every 4-5 years, residents choose to remain in the area. As Amin et al.

285

(2018, 35) explains, residents “understand that disaster is something dangerous but

286

an attempt to leave their place is not something they have to do because they have

287

an attachment to Merapi as a place of origin, where they gain a sense of comfort

288

and safety.” Thus emerges a pattern of return migration in which displaced residents

289

persist in returning to their communities and homes once the immediate risks of a

290

disaster subside.

291

However, recognizing that these patterns of return migration likely increase the risk

292

for future disaster events in the area surrounding Mt. Merapi, BNPB, in collaboration

293

with other government agencies, endeavored to reorganize residential areas for the

294

purpose of hazard mitigation in the aftermath of the 2010 eruptions. For this purpose,

295

a risk analysis was carried out that identified the southern slopes of Mt. Merapi as

296

those at highest risk (Hidayati 2011) and in line with these findings, the government

297

sought to encourage villagers living along Mt. Merapi’s southern slopes to relocate to

298

less hazardous areas. With this goal in mind, the central government, through BNPB,

299

promised to give recovery assistance to victims of the disaster. The total amount of

300

recovery assistance was based on the level of damages that an individual/household

301

experienced in connection to the disaster. Damage level was classified into mild, mod-

302

erate or completely destroyed. People whose houses were completely destroyed were

303

to be relocated and receive permanent housing. While waiting to receive the promised

304

recovery assistance, people lived in temporary housing or shelters. Disaster victims

305

were given a transition period of two years during which time they could stay in their

306

temporary residence, after that, they would have to make a decision whether or not

11

307

they were willing to relocate.

308

Summary & Research Hypotheses

309

The migration literature suggests that economics often plays an important role in

310

migration decisions. With regards to migration in the context of disasters, the litera-

311

ture suggests that factors associated with disasters (e.g., the extent of damage caused

312

by the disaster) are associated strongly with migration decisions. In addition, recovery

313

aid may also influence migration decisions. Depending on how it is organized and dis-

314

tributed, recovery aid may increase the probability of return migration or alternatively

315

for outmigration. In the case of Mt. Merapi, the distribution of recovery assistance to

316

victims of the disaster was organized in part to create incentives for households to

317

resettle out of hazardous areas (Hidayati 2011). With this in mind, we propose the

318

following hypotheses:

319

(1) The overall provision of recovery assistance will be associated with resettlement.

320

(2) Economic recovery assistance in the form of financial aid or remittances will

321

create the strongest incentive for resettlement.

322

(3) Aid “packages” that combine multiple forms of assistance—e.g, financial, food,

323

health, or remittances–may create stronger incentives for resettlement compared

324

to any type of aid provided in isolation as they may more comprehensively

325

address costs of resettling to new locations.

326

Data and methods

327

To address our research questions, we drew on data from the “Community Recovery

328

after a Natural Disaster: A Survey of Communities Affected by Mt. Merapi Eruptions”

329

study. The survey questionnaire used in the study was developed in an iterative pro-

330

cess by a research team including members from Indonesia and the United States.

331

After initial development in English, the questionnaire was translated into Bahasa

332

Indonesia by a translation team made up of research team members who were na-

12

333

tive speakers of either Bahasa Indonesia or English, but who were also fluent in their

334

non-native language of either Bahasa Indonesia or English. The translation process

335

included standard translation/back-translation steps in an effort to increase the ac-

336

curacy and cultural appropriateness of the questionnaire. The data were collected by

337

student research assistants and faculty at the Institute of Community Development

338

Research Center, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. All interactions between the researchers and

339

respondents were carried out in Bahasa Indonesia, and data were then translated into

340

English and entered into a database for further statistical analysis.

341

The study was conducted 16 months after the 2010 eruptions. It was organized as

342

a pilot study to document the experiences of victims of the disaster; including their

343

experiences related to disaster preparedness, mitigation, and recovery, as well as their

344

overall experience of the emergency. This has important implications for the overall

345

power, or limitations, of the data collected to investigate migration in response to the

346

eruptions.

347

Sampling procedures

348

Respondent sampling was conducted with two specific aims in mind. First, to create

349

a sample that experienced varying levels of destruction. Second, to create a sample

350

that included respondents who were still living in a disaster shelter, respondents who

351

had moved home, and respondents who had moved on.

352

The Merapi eruptions struck five Regencies around the mountain: Boyolali, Klaten,

353

Magelang, and Muntilan located within Central Java Province and Sleman Regency

354

located within the Special Region of Yogyakarta (See Figure 1). The damages caused

355

by the disaster varied from one region to another. After taking into consideration

356

time, costs, distance, and that this would be a pilot project on disaster mitigation, ten

357

villages in Sleman Regency were chosen as the study location (See Figure 2). Those

358

ten villages are spread across 4 districts: Turi, Ngemplak, Cangkringan and Pakem.

359

The ten villages were selected based on the relative impact the Merapi eruptions had

360

on each village, which ranged from those most severely affected to those only slightly

361

affected. The villages classified as severely damages were Girikerto Villages (Turi
13

Figure 2. Regency of Sleman

362

District), Hargobinangun Village (Pakem District), Umbulharjo, Kepuharjo, Glagah-

363

harjo, Argomulyo Villages (Cangkringan District) and Sindumartani Village (Ngem-

364

plak District). The villages considered as slightly affected were Wonokerto Village

365

(Turi District), Purwobinangun Village (Pakem District), and the village of Wukirsari

366

(Cangkringan District).

367

Respondent selection

368

After establishing the sampling procedure, individual respondents were selected to

369

obtain a sample of those who still lived in a shelter, those who had returned to their

370

previous communities, and those who had moved away. The method for respondent

371

selection was similar to the selection process used to identify villages and shelters

372

within the districts. Residences were selected starting from the northernmost part

373

of a village or shelter community and selection then moved from east to west and

374

gradually south. Within this process, households were chosen randomly. The selection

375

was conducted until there were 40 respondents from one village, with one respondent

14

376

per household (respondents were individuals that identified as head of household). By

377

drawing respondents from 10 different villages or shelter communities, we obtained

378

a total respondent sample of 400 (two respondents were removed from the analytic

379

sample because they were under the age of 18).

380

It is important to distinguish between the villages that respondents were sampled

381

from and their villages or towns of origin (e.g., their “sending” village). The 398

382

respondents ultimately included in our analyses originated from 50 different villages

383

or towns (See Figure 3).

Figure 3. Migrations Flows from Sending to Receiving Villages. The respondents in our survey came
from 50 sending villages prior to the evacuation order that corresponded with the volcanic eruptions. The
respondents were identified through our sampling procedure which first selected the 10 receiving villages,

15

384

There is some overlap between the villages used for sampling and the villages of

385

origin due to the fact that a portion of the sample had returned to their original

386

village at the time of the survey, but many were still displaced or had moved on to

387

new locations. The distribution of respondents from these various villages was such

388

that roughly a third of the sending villages were represented by only one person. In

389

contrast, many of the sending villages were represented by at least 10 respondents and

390

several villages had 15-20.

391

The sample procedures and protocol for respondent selection were established with

392

the goal of creating a sample representative of the varying levels of destruction that

393

respondents experienced from the eruption. However, as a post-disaster study, we

394

are unable to directly assess the extent to which our sample is representative of the

395

pre-disaster population. Some of the persons displaced by the eruption may have mi-

396

grated beyond the geographic scope of our study. While this is a concern, qualitative

397

data gathered through interviews and focus groups suggest that the vast majority of

398

displaced persons remained within the geographic region surrounding Mr. Merapi, a

399

pattern consistent with research carried out by the Indonesian disaster management

400

agency BNPB (Hidayati 2011) and documented in related studies (Rahman et al.

401

2016). In addition, comparing demographic characteristics of our sample with 2010

402

census data for Indonesia (Statistik 2010) suggests that the distribution of respon-

403

dents within our sample is comparable to that in the Special Region of Yogyakarta

404

and similar to the general population of Indonesia (see Appendix A). For example, our

405

study sample almost matches the population distribution of DI Yogyakarta in terms

406

of religion and is comparable to that for Indonesia overall. While our study sample

407

had a somewhat higher distribution of educational attainment in comparison to the

408

population of DI Yogyakarta, this differences is likely attributable to the age distribu-

409

tions in our sample as educational attainment in DI Yogyakarta decreases with age,

410

so a younger sample in our data would result in somewhat elevated percentages for

411

education attainment.

412

Measures

413

The dependent variable in our analysis captured Migration Status in terms of

414

whether or not a respondent and/or his/her household were displaced, in transition,

415

had moved on, or had moved home at the time that the surveys were collected (100%

416

of our sample was originally displaced due to an evacuation order). The variable was

417

constructed from responses to two questions in the survey: (1) Have they [the re-

418

spondent] returned to their previous community since the disaster? (2) Do they [the

419

respondent] currently live in temporary housing? (shelter, barrack, government relo-

420

cation site, etc.)? Using responses to these questions, the following categories were

421

constructed: (1) Moved Home – respondents who indicated that they had returned to

422

their previous community and no longer living in temporary housing; (2) In Transition

423

– respondents who indicated that they had returned to their previous community and

424

were still living in temporary housing; (3) Displaced – respondents who indicated that

425

they had yet to return to their previous community and were still living in temporary

426

housing; (4) Moved On – respondents who indicated that they had yet to return to

427

their previous community and no longer living in temporary housing. Moved Home

428

was set as the reference category in order to analyze what types of recovery aid were

429

associated with having moved home versus remaining displaced, but also to analyze

430

what types of recovery aid were associated with having moved home versus having

431

moved on. Additional analyses, conducted with “displaced” set as the comparison

432

group, yielded similar results.

433

The independent variables of interest were divided into three sets. The first set

434

included various types of recovery aid provided to households. Regarding Financial

435

Recovery Aid, respondents were asked: “Did they or are they currently receiving any

436

financial assistance from government and/or nongovernmental organizations (exclud-

437

ing family and friends)?” With respect to Food Recovery Aid, respondents were asked:

438

“Did they or are they currently receiving food assistance from government and/or non-

439

governmental organizations (exclude family and friends)?” For Health Recovery Aid,

440

respondents were asked: “Did they or are they currently receiving healthcare/medical

441

assistance from government and or nongovernmental organizations (excluding family
17

442

and friends)?” Finally, for Remittances, respondents were asked: “Does the household

443

receive any money from people not living at their current residence?” to assess the

444

impact of monetary aid provided to the respondent’s household through their social

445

network. Responses for all of the recovery aid questions were coded into dichotomous

446

variables (1 = Ever Received). From these initial variables, three additional recovery

447

aid variables were constructed. Economic Recovery Assistance combined Financial

448

Recovery Aid with Remittances into a categorical variable coded (1 = None [refer-

449

ence category], 2 = Both, 3 = Remittances, 4 = Financial Recovery Aid). Resource

450

Recovery Assistance combined Food Recovery Aid with Health Recovery Aid into a

451

categorical variable coded (1 = None [reference category], 2 = Both, 3 = Health Re-

452

covery Aid, 4 = Food Recovery Aid). Household Recovery Assistance 1 combined all 4

453

types of recovery aid into a categorical variable (0 = None, 1 = 1 Type of Aid, 2 = 2

454

Types of Aid, 3 = 3 Types of Aid, and 4 = 4 Types of Aid).

455

A second set included measures for demographic characteristics and place attach-

456

ment, which often influence migration decisions (Curran et al. 2006; Elmhirst 2007;

457

Gray et al. 2014; Kelly 2011). We measured Age as a categorical variable with six

458

age groups ranging from 1 = 18 to 30 years old to 6 = 70+ years old (the first age

459

group, 18 to 30, was set as the reference category). Sex was included as a dichotomous

460

variable with 1 = Male. Married was also included as a dichotomous variable with 1 =

461

Married. Education was measured as a categorical variable with 1 = Primary School

462

or Less, 2 = Junior High School, and 3 = Senior High School and Beyond (the first

463

education group, Primary School or Less, was set as the reference category). Income

464

was measured as a categorical variable with 1 = 0 to 500,000 Rupiah; 2 = 50,001

465

to 800,000 Rupiah; and 3 = 800,001 to 1,000,000 Rupiah; and 4 = 1,000,000 Rupiah

466

and Beyond (the first income group, 0 to 500,000 Rupiah, was set as the reference

467

category). Finally, as a proxy for community attachment, Residence Duration was

468

calculated by dividing the total number of years lived in the previous community by
1 Early

iterations of the analysis evaluated a three category version of this variable wherein the final
category was coded as “3+” that had a larger number of respondents. The results for this version did not
vary substantially or significantly from the 4 category version, and we opted to use the 4 category version to
demonstrate the overall pattern, while recognizing that the 4th category was represented by a relatively small
number of respondents (n= 24).

18

469

the respondent’s age and then dichotomizing the results such that 1 = whole life, 0 =

470

other. We used this measure as prior research has indicated it is a strong predictor of

471

community attachment (Kasarda and Janowitz 1974).

472

The third set of independent variables included measures of the level of destruction

473

experienced as a result of the volcano, which have been found to influence migration

474

decisions in the context of disasters (Bryner et al. 2017; Hugo 1996; Karimi 2017;

475

Nawrotzki et al. 2014) and were the basis upon which recovery aid was distributed

476

in the aftermath of the Mt. Merapi eruptions. Residence Damaged or Destroyed was

477

measured as a dichotomous variable with 1 = Yes. Environmental Hazards measured

478

the number of various environmental hazards the respondent’s household had expe-

479

rienced in the past year, coded as a count variable ranging from one to three plus.

480

The variable Perceived Destruction measured a respondent’s perception of the total

481

damage that they experienced because of the volcanic eruption, coded as a categorical

482

variable with 1 = Low (reference group), 2 = Medium, and 3 = High. Fears Nature’s

483

Wrath was coded as a dichotomous variable (1 = Strongly Fears Nature’s Wrath).

484

Analytic strategy

485

To address our research questions, we evaluated associations between respondents’

486

migration status and various forms of recovery aid using multinomial logistic regression

487

models. Given that 100% of the sample was displaced and only part of the sample

488

subsequently received aid, these analyses were used in an attempt to identify the

489

treatment effect of the various forms of recovery aid. The analyses were conducted in

490

four stages.

491

In Stage One, each type of recovery aid was analyzed in isolation, with two separate

492

models estimated for each type of aid. The first model adjusted for factors that are

493

often associated with migration in non-disaster settings (i.e., respondent age, sex, ed-

494

ucation, income, and marital status). The second model adjusted for these factors as

495

well as for factors that are often associated with migration in the context of disasters

496

(e.g., perceptions of the severity of the disaster, whether or not a respondent’s home

19

497

was destroyed, whether or not they fear the wrath of nature, and community/place

498

attachment). Only results for the fully adjusted models are presented. For Stage Two,

499

all of the forms of recovery aid were included in one model–these estimates are thus

500

adjusted for factors that are often associated with migration in non-disaster settings,

501

factors that are often associated with migration in the context of disasters, and ad-

502

justed for other types of recover aid that a household may or may not have received.

503

Stage Three grouped the different types of recovery aid into two categorical variables:

504

economic recovery assistance and resource recovery assistance. Finally, Stage Four as-

505

sessed the effect of “aid packages” in which households received varying amounts of

506

recovery assistance packages.

507

Across the analyses, possible collinearity among independent variables was assessed

508

using VIF values, all of which were below 2.5, which were deemed sufficiently low to

509

not raise concern. Regression coefficients were converted to relative risk ratios and

510

organized into data visualizations that included 95% confidence intervals using the R

511

statistical programming environment (R Core Team 2013).

512

Results

513

Descriptive Statistics

514

The majority of respondents had either already moved home (48%) or were still

515

displaced (41%) at the time of data collection (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics).

516

In contrast, roughly 6% of respondents were still in transition and another roughly

517

6% had moved on or relocated to a new area. This distribution is consistent with the

518

aforementioned tendency for individuals/households living near Mt. Merapi to return

519

to their original communities after eruptions, despite awareness that Merapi is an

520

active volcano that erupts regularly (Amin et al. 2018; Hidayati 2011; Rahman et al.

521

2016; Sontosudarmo 1996).

522

With regards to specific types of recovery aid, 46% reported receiving Financial

523

Recovery Aid, 66% reported receiving Health Recovery Aid, 64% reported receiving

524

Food Recovery Aid, and only 14% reported receiving Remittances from their social

Health Recovery Aid ; and 24% reported receiving no Resource Recovery Assistance.

532

Regarding Household Recovery Assistance as “aid packages,” only 6% of respondents

533

reported receiving all 4 types of recovery assistance; 33% reported receiving 3 types

534

of recovery assistance; 26% received 2 types of recovery assistance; 15% received only

535

1 types of recovery assistance; and 20% received none whatsoever.

Stage 1: Aid Specific Analyses

537

A summary of core results for analyses evaluating the relationship between Migra-

538

tion Status and the various types of recovery aid are presented as Relative Risk Ratios

539

(RRR) in Table 2 and presented visually with 95% confidence intervals in Figures 4- 6.

540

Tables containing complete information for all analyses are presented in Appendix B.

541

Recovery aid was distributed by government and non-government organizations to

542

households in the form of financial aid as well as “in kind” resources such as food

543

and health aid. After adjusting for factors typically associated with migration under

544

non-disaster circumstances as well as in the context of disasters (Stage 1), respondents

545

whose household received Financial Recovery Aid were more likely to have Moved On

546

(RRR = 11.62; p<0.001), compared to having Moved Home. Financial Recovery Aid

547

was the only type of recovery aid in Stage 1 that resulted in an association that was

548

both positive and statistically significant with regards to respondents who reported

549

that they had moved on. Respondents whose household received Food Recovery Aid

550

were more likely to have Moved On (RRR = 1.58), compared to having Moved Home.

551

Likewise, respondents whose household received Health Recovery Aid were more likely

552

to have Moved On (RRR = 2.45) compared to having Moved Home. However, the

553

results for food and health aid were not statistically significant. In addition to recov22

554

ery aid received from government and non-government organizations, some households

555

reported that they received remittances from their social network. Respondents whose

556

household received Remittances were more likely to have Moved On (RRR = 1.74),

557

compared to having Moved Home. However, these results were not statistically signif-

558

icant.

Stage 2: Aid Adjusted Analyses

560

After adjusting for other types of recovery aid in addition to other control variables,

561

the association between respondents whose household received Financial Recovery Aid

562

and having Moved On increased in strength (RRR = 15.27; p<0.001). This associa-

563

tion as well as the associations between other types of recovery aid are visualized in

564

Figure 4, which clearly indicates that after adjusting for the other types of recovery

565

aid, Financial Recovery Aid was the only type of recovery aid that resulted in an asso-

566

ciation that was both positive and statistically significant with regards to respondents

567

who reported that they had moved on.

Figure 4. Aid Specific Relative Risk Ratios for Migration Status. Financial Recovery Aid clearly has
a strong, positive association with the migration status of having moved on. While still demonstrating positive
associations, no other type of recovery aid is statistically significant with regards to the migration status of
having moved on

24

568

Stage 3: Grouped Aid Analyses

569

In the grouped analyses, respondents whose household received the combination of

570

both types of Economic Recovery Assistance were more likely to have Moved On (RRR

571

= 17.91; p<0.01), compared to having Moved Home. Similarly, respondents whose

572

household received only Financial Recovery Aid were more likely to have Moved On

573

(RRR = 11.72; p<0.001), compared to having Moved Home. As Figure 5 clearly indi-

574

cates, both of these results were statistically significant. However, while respondents

575

whose household only received Remittances were still more likely to have Moved On

576

(RRR = 1.32), compared to having Moved Home, these results were not statistically

577

significant. Respondents whose household received the combination of both types of

578

Resource Recovery Assistance were more likely to have Moved On (RRR = 2.81), com-

579

pared to having Moved Home. As before, respondents whose household received only

580

Food Recovery Aid or Health Recovery Aid were more likely to have Moved On, com-

581

pared to having Moved Home. However, as before, these results were not statistically

582

significant.

583

Stage 4: Aid Packages Analyses

584

Ultimately, the extent to which households received recovery aid varied substan-

585

tially; i.e., 80 respondents indicated that their household had received no recovery aid

586

whatsoever, 61 respondents indicated that their household received only 1 type of aid,

587

102 respondents indicated that their household received 2 types of aid, 131 respondents

588

indicated that their household received 3 types of aid, and 24 respondents indicated

589

that their household had received every type of aid. In terms of these “aid packages”,

590

after adjusting for other factors, respondents whose household received every type of

591

aid, compared to those whose household received none, were the most likely to have

592

Moved On (RRR = 34.96; p<0.01), compared to having Moved Home. Similarly, re-

593

spondents whose household received 3 types of aid, compared to those whose household

594

received none, were more likely to have Moved On (RRR = 8.14; p<0.05) compared

595

to having Moved Home (see also Figure 6).

25

Figure 5. Grouped Aid Relative Risk Ratios for Migration Status. Economic Recovery Aid: Both and
Economic Recovery Aid: Financial Recovery Aid clearly have strong, positive associations with the migration
status of having moved on. While still demonstrating positive associations, no other combination of recovery
aid is statistically significant with regards to the migration status of having moved on.

26

Figure 6. Aid Packages Relative Risk Ratios for Migration Status. Household Recovery Aid: 4 and
Household Recovery Aid: 3 clearly have strong, positive associations with the migration status of having moved
on. No other combination of recovery aid is statistically significant with regards to the migration status of having

Discussion

597

Our objective in this study was to explore the extent to which recovery aid in

598

the aftermath of a disaster may influence Migration Status. As such, we note several

599

issues requiring further investigation and policy consideration. However, before dis-

600

cussing these considerations, we stress that there is need for caution in interpreting

601

these results–they are associations and our ability to make causal inference is lim-

602

ited. Our interpretation that these associations suggest possible treatment effects is

603

based primarily upon the temporal sequence of events. However, these limitations ac-

604

knowledged, we anticipate that these preliminary findings have policy implications for

605

government and non-government organizations seeking to influence how populations

606

resettle in the aftermath of a disaster–especially for organizations operating to reduce

607

risks in the Merapi area. Furthermore, these preliminary findings can help guide future

608

research; particularly research focused on the well-documented risks and reoccurring

609

impacts of eruptions form Mt. Merapi.

610

With respect to the broad exploration of the extent to which recovery aid in the

611

aftermath of a disaster may influence Migration Status, all of the different types of

612

recovery aid analyzed were positively associated with respondents reporting that their

613

household had moved on compared to moved home, which is consistent with the first of

614

our hypotheses. However, of the different types of recovery aid analyzed, only Financial

615

Recovery Aid was both associated strongly with having moved on and statistically

616

significant when analyzed by itself (consistent with our second hypothesis). Moreover,

617

the strength of this association increased after adjusting for whether or not a household

618

had received other types of recovery aid. The grouped analyses add some nuance to

619

the aid specific results by demonstrating that the combination of Financial Recovery

620

Aid with Remittances resulted in an association with having moved on that was even

621

stronger when both types of aid were received as opposed to when just Financial

622

Recovery Aid was received. The caveat for future researchers and policy makers is that

623

while the combined effect was stronger, the difference was not statistically significant

624

(the confidence intervals overlapped). This nuance was extended in the “aid packages”

625

analyses wherein the results suggest that the “aid packages” that were relatively more
28

626

effective were those that included most, if not all, of the different types of recovery

627

aid, a finding that is consistent with our third and final hypothesis. This suggests

628

that while food and health recovery aid as well as remittances may not have been

629

sufficient in and of themselves to increase resettlement, they may enhance the effect

630

of financial recovery aid. Given the interest to facilitate household relocation to safer

631

areas as a means of risk reduction in the region (Hidayati 2011; Rahman et al. 2016),

632

these results suggest that the provision of financial assistance is likely the best type of

633

recovery aid for achieving this objective. However, policy makers should consider that

634

it is possible that providing financial assistance in combination with other recovery

635

resources may yield even stronger incentives for resettlement overall.

636

While we believe this study has policy implications and also contributes to the

637

literature on migration in the aftermath of a disaster, we recognize that it is not

638

without limitation. The data used were part of a pilot study organized to document

639

in detail the experiences of victims of the disaster. This affects our ability to leverage

640

these data for statistical analyses investigating migration status as this was not the

641

main purpose of the data. In addition, as a pilot study, only a relatively small sample

642

of data was collected. This limits the statistical power of our analyses such that some

643

indicators may have had stronger statistical significance (as well as tighter confidence

644

intervals) if the study size was larger. Likewise, more nuanced analyses could have been

645

conducted; e.g., a full categorical breakdown of different aid package combinations

646

rather than a count of the various categories.

647

There is also the potential for bias within our data, as discussed in detail in the

648

methods section. Sample bias may exist as our sample only included the geographic

649

region surrounding Mt. Merapi. It is possible that some of the persons displaced by the

650

eruption migrated beyond the geographic scope of our study. It is unfortunate that for

651

individuals or households who may have moved further away, we are unable to assess

652

whether or not they were more likely to have experienced more severe consequences of

653

the disaster compared to those who remained in the same geographic region or if they

654

were they more likely to have had the means to resettle further from their original

655

home. It is difficult to directly assess how this potential bias may affect our results,

29

656

but given our theoretical framework we anticipate that their absence from the study

657

results in more conservative estimates. It is possible that there is also recall bias within

658

our data due to the timing of data collection. However, given that data collection for

659

all respondents occurred in the same time period, we anticipate that any recall bias

660

within our data is non-differential.

661

Finally, as with the majority of disasters from natural hazards, these findings come

662

from a specific event, occurring at a specific time and in a specific location. This is

663

important given that the destruction resulting from Mt. Merapi’s eruption only became

664

a “natural disaster” through interaction with local social systems. As Perry states, “It

665

is not the hurricane wind or storm surge that makes the disaster; these are the sources

666

of the damage. The disaster is the impact on individual coping patterns and the inputs

667

and outputs of social systems” (Perry 2007, 12). In as much as a disaster is a social

668

phenomenon (Perry 2007; Quarantelli and Dynes 1977) that is inherently local, it is

669

difficult to gauge the extent to which our findings are generalizable beyond the context

670

of Java, Indonesia. At a minimum, these findings could inform other research studies

671

through incorporation into a future systematic review or meta analysis of indicators

672

of return migration in the aftermath of disasters from natural hazards.

673

Despite these limitations, we have endeavored to provide meaningful insights to po-

674

tential associations between various types of recovery aid and migration status in the

675

aftermath of a disaster. Moreover, as we move beyond this pilot study to continue con-

676

ducting research in the region, these results, as well as lessons learned while conducting

677

this pilot study, will inform our efforts to better understand the social ramifications

678

of Mt. Merapi’s frequent eruptions–the most recent of which occurred earlier this year

679

(Press 2018).

680

Conclusion

681

Despite the well-known danger, the area surrounding the mountain remains densely

682

populated and the site of frequent return migrations as households persist in return-

683

ing to their original communities once the dangers associated with an eruption have

30

684

subsided (Amin et al. 2018; Hidayati 2011; Rahman et al. 2016; Sontosudarmo 1996).

685

Our overall results are consistent with this documented trend. This pattern of return

686

migration is so prominent that the Indonesian government has endeavored to create

687

incentives to encourage resettlement to areas that are less hazardous, but still in the

688

general Mt. Merapi area. This pattern is perhaps somewhat unique, as it is in contrast

689

to findings from research studies from other geographic areas and context that found

690

that post disaster, more educated people tended to move to cities in their same re-

691

gion, which resulted in a secondary disaster in the form of brain drain. This migration

692

pattern could be due to the limited types of jobs in local areas post-disaster and need

693

to diversify family income (Junge et al. 2015).

694

This study evaluated multiple types of recovery aid in order to identify which types

695

may play a role in influencing migration decisions in the aftermath of a disaster. While

696

return migration in these circumstances may constitute an opportunity for migrants to

697

reclaim what they lost and begin anew, classic studies on the effects of disasters from

698

natural hazards suggest that the process of starting over is difficult and life is never

699

truly the same (Erikson 1978; Ruben et al. 2009). The trip home is but the first step in

700

regaining what was lost, and therefore, return may not be the best choice. Moreover,

701

there is apparent interest in the current context to help the most vulnerable relocate to

702

safer locations. Given these circumstances, future research should evaluate the effects

703

of return migration on life outcomes, such as health and quality of life. While buildings

704

can be rebuilt, the same is not always true of the past (Erikson 1978), and perhaps

705

for some it would indeed be better to move on rather than move back–especially in a

706

world where disasters from natural hazards are an ever more frequent reality.

Comparison data obtained from Indonesia’s 2010 census (Statistik 2010), The marital
status of the study sample is comparable to percentages reported for DI Yogyakarta
and Indonesia overall in terms of divorced and widowed. The higher proportion of
married compared to single is likely attributable to respondent status as head of
household. In terms of religion, our study sample almost matches the population
distribution DI Yogyakarta and is comparable to that for Indonesia overall. Our study
sample has a somewhat higher distribution of educational attainment in comparison
to the population of DI Yogyakarta, an areas that is known for having higher
education attainment compared to national averages (Jones and Pratomo 2016). This
differences is likely attributable to the age distributions in our sample as educational
attainment in DI Yogyakarta decreases with age, so a younger sample in our data
would result in somewhat elevated percentages for education attainment.
