Abstract
Whether to avoid learners’ first language (L1) or to make use of it in the second language (L2)
classes is a controversial issue. Some studies have challenged the effectiveness of the monolingual
approach to foreign language learning. This study investigates Saudi university learners’ attitudes
and perceptions towards incorporating their L1(Arabic) in English class. This study also sheds
light into the relationship between students’ perceptions and proficiency level in the target
language. To this end, Gaebler's questionnaire (2014) was administered to 60 female learners
studying in the preparatory year at a Saudi university. They were from three different English
proficiency levels. The results showed that advanced learners hold a negative attitude towards the
use of L1 in their English classes, whereas elementary and intermediate learners generally perceive
the judicious use of their L1 positively.

Foreign Language Learners’ Attitudes and Perceptions

Almohaimeed & Almurshed

Introduction
The issue of how to teach a foreign\second language (L2) has always been debated. The Reform
Movement in the 1880s came as an opposing movement to the practices of the grammar-translation
method that was dominating foreign language teaching at the time. That teaching method was
basically characterized by the excessive use of learners’ first language as the main medium of
instruction to master the grammar of the foreign language. Developments in language theories,
however, opened new horizons for language teaching methods and approaches. One example of
these methods was the direct method, which prohibits the use of learners’ mother tongue and calls
for teachers who are native speakers of the L2. The underpinning view of this method was that the
L2 is acquired in the same way the first language (L1) is acquired by children (Richards & Rodgers,
2001).
The debate about whether to use learners’ L1 in L2 classes or to avoid it is not new. There
is an extensive body of literature that has addressed this issue. Practitioners and researchers are
constantly attempting to prove their view of L1 use either as essential or detrimental in foreign
language teaching. While some practitioners believe that L1 plays an important role in foreign
language classrooms, others argue that using L1 is a hindrance and that it diminishes the learner’s
exposure to the target language.
Some educational institutions insist on adopting the monolingual approach to teaching their
students; that is, they allow only the use of the target language regardless of their students’ attitudes
towards this approach or even the achieved learning outcomes of the students. The aim of this
study was to investigate university students’ perceptions of and attitudes towards the use of L1
(Arabic) in L2 (in this case, English) classes and to examine the relationship between students’
attitude toward using Arabic and their proficiency level in English.
Literature Review
Arguments and Counter Arguments for Only-L2 Use in L2 Classes
According to Zhao and Macaro (2014), there are three stances regarding the language used in L2
teaching settings: the total exclusion of L1 in target language instruction, the favored and
maximized use of L2 as the medium of instruction, and the use of L2 coupled with judicious use
of L1. Advocates of the complete exclusion of L1 in the target language instruction build their
belief on a number of assumptions.
Cook (2001) identifies two reasons for those who advocate only L2 use in L2 classes. First,
the L2 learning process is similar to the process of L1 learning. This claim seems to be weak,
particularly when it comes to comparing children acquiring their L1 with adults learning an L2.
Bley-Vroman (1990) challenges the claim of existing similarities between L1 and L2 acquisition
by presenting some differences between children’s acquisition of L1 and adults’ L2 learning. He
contends that the innate ability that children have to acquire their L1 disappears in adulthood.
Additionally, children have zero knowledge about their L1 when they learn it, unlike adults, who
depend on their L1 to learn the L2. Moreover, according to Bley-Vroman, the motivation and
amount of exposure to the language are higher in children acquiring an L1 than in adults acquiring
an L2. The second reason identified by Cook (2001) is that the acquisition processes of L1 and L2

are completely separate. The authors believe that the instances of L1 interference and transfer
occurring in the L2 are clear evidence that the learning processes are inseparable.
Zhao and Macaro (2014) point out that the call for L1 avoidance in L2 classrooms can be
based on Krashen’s input hypothesis and Long’s interaction hypothesis. Krashen (1992) claims
that exposure to comprehensible input increases the learner’s opportunity to acquire the language.
He adds that comprehensible input should be accompanied by facilitative affective factors, such
as high motivation and self-confidence, for language acquisition to take place. However, Gass
(1988), argues that “it is clear that input of some sort is necessary in order for acquisition to take
place. What sort of input is necessary is less clear” (p.201). She doubts that students can convert
the language used as input to output. This means that increasing the exposure to L2 may not
enhance language acquisition because the input is not necessarily going to be intake and that there
are other factors besides input that should be considered. Another argument for the exclusive use
of L2 is based on Long’s interaction hypothesis, which maintains that the negotiation of meanings
in L2 enhances L2 acquisition (Lightbrown & Spada, 2006). However, full application of this
hypothesis is not always practical if time constraints and huge classrooms are considered because
negotiation of meanings can be time-consuming. Insufficient evidence and lack of clear reasons
for avoiding the use of L1 in L2 classrooms has encouraged practitioners and researchers to
investigate further the role of L1 in foreign language teaching and how it can be used to facilitate
L2 learning (Macaro, 2001).
L1 Role in L2 Classrooms
Research has been carried out to observe the different dimensions of the L1 role in L2 learning. It
has been found that L1 use has various benefits to offer in the L2 classroom. Atkinson (1987), for
example, contends that L1 use is advantageous for three reasons. First, translation is the preference
of the majority of learners. Second, L1 use is a technique that gives learners the chance to express
their feelings and ideas. Finally, L1 is a useful technique for the best exploitation of class time.
McMillan and Rivers (2011) further claim that careful and controlled use of the L1 can be
profitable for social, communicative, and cognitive purposes in L2 learning. Cook (2001) believes
that teachers can make use of learners’ native language in difficult grammar explanation, new
vocabulary teaching, and classroom management. These crucial functions that the L1 has for
explaining difficult grammar and new lexical items are reported in a number of studies in addition
to L1 use for compensating for lack of comprehension (Edstrom, 2006; Macaro, 2001; Mattioli,
2004; Polio & Duff, 1994). Turnbull (2001), however, argues that taking Cook’s suggested
functions for L1 use into consideration leave only limited functions for the target language. As
such, Turnbull calls for further research on how and when the L1 should be used. Edstrom (2006),
in her analysis of her teaching, finds that L1 was useful in clarification of assignments, grading
policies, and classroom strategies. She adds that learners’ cultural misconceptions were only
countered by the use of L1.
The facilitating role of L1 goes beyond classroom activities and teaching vocabulary or
grammar. Research has further explored the beneficial role of L1 in learning and teaching language
skills (Nazary, 2008). For instance, Koren (1997), after observing students listening to the target
language and taking notes in the L1, concludes that taking notes in the L1 is a good strategy for
understanding. As for writing skills, Hamin and Majid (2006) find improvement in the writing

performance of students who use their mother tongue to generate ideas. Cole (1998), meanwhile,
argues that using L1 is seen as inappropriate and unjustifiable when it comes to speaking and
listening activities unless instructions need clarification or there are cultural concepts that are
crucial for comprehension.
In addition to the aforementioned role of L1, it has been found that learners’ native
language plays a primary role in reducing the affective barriers to L2 learning, thereby assisting
comprehension and facilitating L2 acquisition (Auerbach, 1993; Meyer, 2008). According to Baily
(2005), allowing L1 use can motivate learners and increase their confidence in using L2.
Teachers’ and Learners’ Perceptions of L1 Use
The issue of using the mother tongue in L2 classrooms has attracted the attention of researchers
investigating teachers’ and learners’ perceptions and attitudes. McMillan and Rivers (2011) in a
study they conducted in Japan find that many native English-speaker teachers in a communicative
framework perceive the use of the students’ L1, either by the students or by the teachers, beneficial
for the enhancement of L2 learning. In another study, Gaebler (2014) investigates graduate
students’ and professors’ perceptions of L1 use. He concludes that some students believe that the
use of their L1 is a hindrance to their L2 learning, while others feel comfort with the use of L1. As
for the professors, they respect the students’ views and attempt to integrate L1 in teaching L2.
Nazary (2008) conducts a study in Iran, and he reports that Iranian university students are hesitant
to use their L1. However, a recent study in Iran conducted by Sa’d and Qadermazi (2015) that
examines the use of L1 from the perspectives of Iranian elementary EFL learners and teachers
concludes that there is a positive attitude toward the role and use of L1. They note that only a
minority prefer the only-English policy, while the majority favore the limited and judicious use of
L1.
In the Saudi EFL classroom context, few studies have investigated the perceptions of
teachers and students on the use of L1 in L2 classroom settings. Al-nofaie (2010) investigates the
attitudes of teachers and learners in an intermediate school in Jeddah. In her study, she concludes
that teachers and learners are in agreement regarding the positive effects of using Arabic, but they
hold different perceptions regarding the purposes and functions of the L1. Alshammary (2011)
also examines the attitudes of college teachers and students of pre-intermediate level in Madinah.
The results show that the majority of teachers and students believe that L1 should be used in
English classes. The purposes they deemed Arabic useful for are explaining new vocabulary and
explaining difficult ideas and concepts.
Although the literature is filling up with studies that explore the attitudes and perceptions
of learners about L1 use in L2 classes, it still lacks studies, especially in the Saudi context, that
explicitly investigate the relationship between the learners’ attitudes toward L1 use and their
proficiency level in the L2. On these grounds, this study aimed to examine Saudi university EFL
learners’ attitudes and perceptions of L1 use in only-English classrooms and the relationship
between their attitudes and their proficiency level in English.

Almohaimeed & Almurshed

Purpose of the Study
One of the important objectives in most Saudi universities is to improve learners’ English language
to prepare them for their major studies, which are mostly delivered in English. For this purpose,
universities allocate the first year to some basic knowledge courses like mathematics and
communication skills in addition to intensive English courses. The only-English approach is
implemented strictly in some English programs regardless of learners’ level in English. Based on
previous studies like the ones mentioned above and other studies in the literature (Swain & Lapkin,
2000; Khresheh, 2012; Alrabah et al, 2016), and based on the fact that students and teachers, not
administrators, are the best ones to decide on what language should be used in the classroom
(McMillian & Rivers, 2011), this study aimed to examine university Preparatory Year learners’
perception of L1 use in English classes and the relationship between their perspectives and
proficiency level in L2. Thus, the research questions addressed in this study were as follows:
Research Questions
1. What are the attitudes and perceptions of university students toward using their L1 in the
foreign language classroom?
2. Is there a relationship between students’ attitudes toward using their L1 and their level of
proficiency in the target language?
Methodology
Setting and Participants
The Preparatory Year Program at the university where the study took place offers intensive
English courses to equip students with English academic skills which are necessary for students to
pursue their future majors at the university. Upon university admission, students sit for a placement
test that places them in English courses according to their proficiency level: beginner, intermediate,
or advanced. The program follows a strict only-English policy, where neither teachers nor students
are allowed to use Arabic in class. In this study, the participants were 60 Saudi female students.
The students were from three different proficiency classes, with 20 students from each class
selected randomly. The first language of the participants was Arabic, and all of them had studied
English for at least six years. All the learners gave their consent to participate in the study.
Instrument
The instrument used in this study was a questionnaire adopted from Gaebler’s study (2014), with
only a few modifications related to the names of the languages addressed in the study, Arabic as
L1 and English as L2 (see Appendix A). The questionnaire was designed to collect information
about students’ opinions about the appropriateness and purposes of using L1 by their teachers,
their classmates, and themselves in the L2 class. The questionnaire consisted of 10 multiple-choice
questions. Some questions had the choice of ‘other’ where the participants could add their answer
if it was not mentioned in the choices that were given. The questionnaire was administered in
English for advanced students and in Arabic for a beginner- and intermediate-level students to
ensure adequate comprehension of the questionnaire’s items.

Results
Students showed different attitudes toward whether or not Arabic should be used in English
classes, question 1. Beginners (level A, hereafter) surprisingly do not seem to be advocating the
incorporation of Arabic; 70% of them answered with ‘no’, and only 30% answered affirmatively.
Advanced students (level C, hereafter) similarly expressed negative attitudes, with 80% believing
that Arabic should not be used. In contrast, the responses of the intermediate students (level B,
henceforth) reflected the more neutral position, with 50% accepting and 50% rejecting the use of
Arabic (see Figure 1).

For the second question, ‘How often should your teacher use Arabic in the classroom?’ the
majority of level C believed that teachers should never use Arabic (75%), and a minority felt that
rare and sometimes use would be acceptable (15% and 10% respectively). Level A and level B
perspectives were comparable, with 50% and 55% for rare use and 40% and 30% for sometimes
use respectively (see Figure 2).

grammar, Level A and B responses were identical, 55% and 65% respectively, whereas
explaining difficult concepts and ideas was 70% for level A and 60% for B. In contrast, 25% of
level C believed in the importance of Arabic for defining new vocabulary, while 60% thought
that teachers should not use Arabic. In the option ‘other’, about 25% of level A and 20% of level
C students expressed that teachers should use Arabic to explain difficult vocabulary items that
cannot be explained by other means to give advice for exams or in case of an emergency.

The differences among the three levels became clearer in how they perceived the usefulness
of Arabic (see Figures 7 and 8). While 40% and 45% of level C believed that Arabic does not help
them learn English or helps them just a little, question 7, 70% of level B and 45% of level A
thought that Arabic helps them a fair amount. Additionally, 40% of level A believed that Arabic
helps a lot in learning English. In expressing in what way Arabic is helping, question 8, the
majority of levels A, 60%, and B, 70%, saw Arabic as helpful for understanding difficult concepts
and for understanding new and difficult vocabulary, 70% & 55% respectively. Comparable
responses were expressed by level C students, with 45% for understanding difficult concepts and
35% for understanding vocabulary. Only a few students, however, expressed that Arabic makes
them feel at ease and less stressed.

Students’ perceptions about whether Arabic prevents English learning, question 9, were similar
across the three levels (see Figure 9). The majority believed that Arabic prevents them a little to
a fair amount of English learning, while 30% of A, 35% of B, and 15% of C thought that Arabic
does not prevent their English learning at all.

With regard to question 10, the majority of the students in levels A, B, and C expressed
that Arabic can be harmful because it limits their exposure to English, 50%, 45%, and 55%
respectively, and allows them to avoid speaking in English, 40%, 65%, and 55% respectively. Of
level C, 65% added that Arabic might prevent them from thinking in English (see Figure 10).

Discussion
In responding to the two research questions about students’ perceptions and attitudes toward the
use of Arabic in the foreign language classroom and their relation to students’ level of proficiency
in English, the beginners seemed reluctant to accept the use of Arabic despite their low proficiency.
This may be the result of their teachers’ insistence on avoiding Arabic or from the concept that
immersion in the target language leads to better learning. In the rest of the questionnaire, however,
beginner students felt more comfortable admitting their need for the use of Arabic and expressed
the usefulness of Arabic for understanding new vocabulary and difficult grammar. They believed
that teachers could use L1 for the mentioned functions, whereas students’ use of L1 should be
limited. This reflects students’ positive attitude only toward controlled use of Arabic and that
Arabic may be harmful to certain aspects. This result is in alignment with Alnofaie’s (2010) study
mentioned above and other relevant studies (Sa'd & Qadermazi, 2015). Intermediate students, in
contrast, expressed more freely their preference for Arabic use for functions similar to those
mentioned by the beginners. Although the results here comply with Alshammary’s (2011)
findings, they contradict with what Nazary (2008) found about intermediate learners as being the

most hesitant about L1 use. The only explanation that can be drawn here is that these students are
satisfied with their level in English, and so they are not afraid of Arabic preventing their learning;
rather, they see it as a shorter way for comprehension. Advanced learners, meanwhile, expressed
a negative attitude toward the use of Arabic. The majority believed that Arabic should be avoided
by teachers and students. A few believed that Arabic could be helpful for understanding vocabulary
and concepts. It is clear that advanced students refrain from using their L1 because they are
competent enough to manage negotiation of meanings in the L2. These results seem to be
compatible with those of previous studies that investigated students’ perceptions in terms of
attitudes and preferred functions of L1 such as Alnofaie’s (2010), Alshammary’s (2011), Gaebler’s
(2014), and Sa’d and Qadermazi’s (2015).
Conclusion and Implications
From the collected and analyzed data, it is evident that students’ proficiency level plays a
role in their attitudes and perceptions about L1 use. The results suggest considering modifications
in educational institutions’ policies regarding what language to be allowed in foreign language
classrooms in a manner that can contribute to enhancing students’ learning. The findings of the
present study, however, show variation in perspectives among students from the same level, and
this suggests that proficiency is not the only factor that affects students’ perspectives. Other
factors, such as motivation and risk-taking, may influence students’ perceptions and attitudes.
Triangulation of data collection could have added to the validity and reliability of the results of
this study, but time constraints allowed only for one instrument. Further research that uses
triangulated data is suggested for investigating the relationship between proficiency and
perceptions of students. Further research can also be carried out to examine the influence of other
factors on students’ perceptions of L1 use.
