Smith v. State 2

Abstract
We interrogate the Georgia Supreme Court ruling in the 2002 capital murder trial of
Brandon Smith to illustrate how “fair cross section” implementation in Georgia’s legal system
was used to create case law that institutionalized discrimination against Hispanic participation in
the jury process. By paying scrupulous attention to legal precedents specifically intended to
widen inclusion under the equal protection clause, the Justices’ decision put into place one legal
standard for Hispanic participation in the jury process and another standard for all other groups.
Using critical race theory, we argue that legal precedents based on distorted perceptions of the
composition of the Hispanic community in new destination states, common practices of jury
forced balancing and sole reliance on decennial census numbers collided to create case law that
unintentionally deprives Georgia’s Hispanics of equal protection under the law and may
contributeto the disproportionate presence of racialized minorities in the criminal justice system.

Smith v. State 1

On December 28, 1999, nineteen-year-old Brandon Smith and two younger friends burglarized
the home of Gary Lane Dale. Unexpectedly finding Dale at home, Smith shot and killed him and
attempted to hide the crime by setting fire to the house. Within a month, all three men were
apprehended, and Smith was charged with malice murder, armed robbery, burglary, arson and
criminal gang activity. Ultimately, Smith was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
Nothing about Smith’s case obviously connects it to race or racism. Smith, his
accomplices, and his victim were non-Hispanic whites, as were the prosecutor, judge, and
defense lawyer in the case. Nonetheless, the string of events set in place by Smith v. Georgia
(2002) led to a legal decision that demands a stringent representational standard for the nation’s
largest minority group, while holding non-Hispanics to a more lenient standard.
The sixth amendment to the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to a
jury of their peers. For much of this country’s history, however, “peers” were non-Hispanic white
men. Beginning in the forties (with Smith v. Texas [1940]), the courts upheld a series of
constitutional challenges to the practice of excluding women (Glasser v. United States [1942];
Taylor v. Louisiana [1975]) and blacks (Ballard v. United States [1946]) from juries. Today, it is
expected that jury pools (i.e., a list compiled by the courts of all adult citizens from whom juries
can be selected, also called a venire) must be comprised of a fair cross section of the population.
In this study, we examine the Georgia Supreme Court’s decision on a challenge to the
findings in a pre-trial motion in the Smith case on fair cross-sectional representation. We argue
that a unique set of circumstances operating within a racialized legal system created ideal
conditions for the institutionalization of new but inequitable practices in the justice system. Legal
precedents based on Georgia’s methods of jury balancing and sole reliance on the decennial

Smith v. State 2

census collided to create case law that deprives Hispanics1 of equal protection under the law and
may contribute to the disproportionate presence of racialized minorities in the criminal justice
system. With Hispanic defendants less likely to be tried by a jury of their peers, legal decisions
like Smith promise to exacerbate already disproportionately high levels of incarceration for
Hispanics and other minority populations.
Structural Racism, Critical Race Theory, and the Law
Popular explanations of racism tend to focus on “bad” individuals who hold antiquated and
irrational ideas that lead to discriminatory acts. In these accounts, racist individuals reproduce
racial disparities through their individual and collective expression of racist ideologies. Critical
race theorists (e.g., Delgado & Stefancic, 2011; Jones, 2002; Yosso, 2005), in contrast, assert that
individualized explanations of racism inadequately account for the continued existence of racial
disparities. Opinion polls regularly show that acceptance of explicitly racist attitudes and
actions has declined (cf. Feagin, Vera & Batur, 2001), and groups that advocate ideologies of
racial superiority are marginalized in society. Still, race researchers document the existence of a
laissez faire racism (Bobo, Kluegel & Smith, 1996), which is reframed as a color-blind critique of
perceived or projected “cultural” differences (Bonilla-Silva, 2010).
Critical race scholars argue that racism is embedded within societal structures and
institutions. Moving beyond individualized explanations of racism, structural racism suggests
that social systems are racialized (Lawrence et al., 2010; Powell, 2007). Thus, structural racism is
endemic to the human experience since hierarchies of race and the resulting systematic disparities
are deeply embedded within the social, political, and economic structures of society (BonillaSilva, 1997; Powell, 2007). For example, the University of Georgia (UGA) for many years

Smith v. State 3

offered preferential admission to “legacy students”—children of former UGA students—
ignoring the fact that this policy favored white students since UGA was an all-white school until
1961. Thus, structural racism describes the ways that society is racialized to confer privileges
upon the dominant race and to marginalize minority races (Lawrence et al., 2010; Vaught &
Castagno, 2008). Harms that are enacted upon racialized minorities thus become systemic—a
central component of the social structures of society. Harm can therefore occur regardless of the
presence or absence of specific individuals who consciously intend to discriminate. In the words
of Bonilla-Silva (2010), structural racism describes “racism without racists.”
Structural racism is often enacted at the institutional level, as policies that are intended to
be color-blind or race neutral—even ameliorative of racial inequities—actually encode disparate
and racialized outcomes for minorities (Feagin, Feagin & Feagin, 1986). Since structural racism
operates without individual racist actors to encode racial disparities at a broad societal level,
institutions within societies can and do enact laws and policies that contribute to and reproduce
racialized outcomes (López, 2000). Unintentionally racialized institutional policies arise from
the stigma and marginalization of racial minorities2 in society as a whole (cf. Hing, 2009), and
from stereotyping in a way that allows minorities to be blamed for majority-minority differences
(Bobo, Kluegel & Smith, 1996). For example, a large proportion of US immigrants are Hispanic,
so Hispanics tend to be stereotyped as (often unauthorized) immigrants, and immigrant status is
used to explain Hispanic-Anglo differences in income, education, and other social conditions.
The law is one institution that maintains racial hierarchies (Altman, 1990; Bartholomew &
Hunt, 1990). Critical race theorists hold that color-blind laws, including case law, cannot
ameliorate racial inequalities, because inequalities are intrinsically embedded into the social

Smith v. State 4

structure, including the legal structure (Matsuda & Lawrence, 1993). At best, color-blind rulings
perpetuate the status quo, which underscores white privilege as a valuable property that can be
possessed only by whites (Harris, 1993; Ladson-Billings, 1999). At worst, color-blind rulings
exacerbate existing inequalities. In our analysis of the Smith case, we argue that the Justices’
interpretation of the “correct” means for implementing the fair cross section requirement of a
demographically representative jury—a constitutional right that should, theoretically, expand
legal inclusion of minorities—underscores that legal remedies fall short of justice.
Color-blind legal decision-making has far-reaching consequences for punishment in the
United States, including death penalty sanctions and mass incarceration. If legal actors produce
jury pools that are not representative of minority constituencies, they fail to adequately
represent the communities where these cases are tried and they also overlook the statistically
influential role of jurors’ race and jury racial composition in jury decision-making. The Capital
Jury Project, one of the major research initiatives on the death penalty in the United States, has
demonstrated that the presence of five or more white males on the jury dramatically increases
the likelihood of a death sentence (Bowers, Steiner & Sandys, 2001). The presence of minority
jurors dramatically lowers the likelihood of death; the addition of a single white male tips the
scale to a far greater chance of a death sentence. Because of the small size of juries, racial
impacts develop at the level of the individual included (and excluded) in jury composition.
The absence of Hispanics in jury pools also shapes court decision-making broadly in a
manner that risks increasing the flow of Hispanics into the US prison system. The term mass
imprisonment is defined both by sheer numbers (a rate of incarceration and prison population
size that dramatically exceeds historical norms) and the social concentration of imprisonment’s

Smith v. State 5

effects upon whole groups of the prison population (Garland, 2001). The groups most
dramatically impacted by mass incarceration are African Americans and Hispanics (Travis,
2002). For instance, in 2000 as the US prison population neared a record-breaking two million
mark, drug admissions for Hispanics were 22 times the number of 1983 admissions, while white
admissions increased at a much lower rate (even as whites were and continue to be the primary
drug users in the U.S.). As the War on Drugs accounts for the vast majority of this increase in
imprisonment, the daily decision-making processes of justice actors who ignore the racial
implications of drug policies and enforcement produce racial disparities in punishment
(Alexander, 2010; Western, 2006). In the case of juries and jury pools, through a process of
under-inclusion, legal actors have made discretionary decisions that produce and exacerbate
issues of minority overrepresentation in the punishment phase of criminal justice processes.
The overall effects of this phenomenon extend outward into social life by way of the
collateral consequences of mass incarceration. State laws that disenfranchise prisoners and
former felons have nullified the voting rights of millions of minority citizens (Manza & Uggen,
2006) and have severely restricted access to housing, employment, education, and public
benefits of millions more (Mauer & Chesney-Lind, 2002). Hispanic communities, like African
American communities, have been the direct targets of mass incarceration and its collateral
consequences, further marginalizing and removing them from political representation.
The exclusion of Hispanics from mainstream institutions of US society may be worsened
by the escalation in anti-immigrant laws and policies (McKanders, 2010). Georgia, in particular,
has a lengthy history of implementing state and local anti-immigrant policies in response to the
increasing Hispanic and immigrant population (Bohon, 2006). In the past, state policymakers

Smith v. State 6

have declared English the official state language, severely restricted unauthorized immigrants’
access to public benefits, and banned unauthorized students from the state’s top five public
universities. Across the state, law enforcement agencies have partnered with the federal
government to implement 287(g), a federal program that deputizes state and local law
enforcement officers as immigration agents. These practices extend policing tactics against
those perceived as foreign-born into new destination settings3.
In 2011, the Georgia legislature passed HB 87, the “Illegal Immigration Reform and
Enforcement Act.” Modeled after Arizona’s controversial SB 1070, Georgia’s law empowered
police officers to verify the immigration and citizenship status of individuals in the course of a
routine traffic stop, mandated that employers use the federal electronic eligibility verification (EVerify) database to confirm the documentation status of employees, and established criminal
penalties for those who knowingly “harbor” or transport unauthorized immigrants. Although
most of these provisions have been permanently blocked, the bill’s passage is an indication of
Georgia’s escalation in anti-immigrant legislation. The plethora of anti-immigrant laws, and the
devolution of immigration enforcement (Coleman, 2012) to state and local officials like police
officers and public benefits coordinators, ensures that Hispanics—who are often perceived as
unauthorized, regardless of their actual citizenship or immigration status—will be increasingly
targeted for enforcement (Conley, 2013).
Analytical Approach
We interrogate Smith as a case of structural racism in a new destination setting. Using participant
observation, discourse analysis, interviews, and quantitative data, our analysis provides an “an indepth, multifaceted investigation”(Feagin, Orum and Sjoberg, 1989: 2) of the Smith decision in

Smith v. State 7

order to “make claims grounded in the claims of those who make them” (ibid: 8). The first author
served as an expert witness in the Smith case and in several cases impacted by the Smith ruling,
thus allowing her to observe court proceedings, interactions between key players, and courtroom
dynamics and to gain access to those involved in the Smith case. Further, we examined court
transcripts and the majority and minority decisions along with other jurisdictional rulings on jury
composition in order to better understand the Smith ruling. We also interviewed expert witnesses
and Smith’s defense attorney to extend our analysis of the findings. Finally, we used data from
the American Community Survey and two decennial censuses (1990 and 2000) to predict the
extent to which the Smith ruling could adversely affect racial minorities in the State of Georgia.
Smith v. The State of Georgia
Jury pools must reflect a fair cross section of the population, and whether or not a trial court’s jury
pool meets the fair cross section requirement is evaluated based on the demographic composition
of the county’s population. If women comprise 53 percent of a county’s over-18 population, then
both the grand jury pool and the traverse (trial) jury pool must be about 53 percent women. The
groups that must be accounted for in the jury pool differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the
US Supreme Court has articulated few guidelines for which groups must be included in the pools;
fair cross section only requires that “distinctive” groups cannot be systematically excluded. In
many states, courts have maintained that three classes constitute distinctive groups: (1) women and
men, (2) whites, blacks4, and other races, and (3) Hispanics and non-Hispanics. In most
Southeastern states, including Georgia, Hispanics were not recognized as a distinctive group at the
time of the Smith ruling.

Smith v. State 8

In 2000, five distinctive groups were recognized in each of Georgia’s 159 counties: men,
women, blacks, whites, and “other race” persons. Dan Summer, Smith’s attorney, filed a
challenge to Smith’s indictment and a pre-trial challenge to the traverse jury arguing that the
juries in Smith’s case were unconstitutional because they were drawn from jury pools that
proportionally accounted for these five groups but did not represent a fair cross section of the Hall
County, Georgia population. Specifically, Summer argued that the jury pools reflected the 1990
demographic composition of Hall County, but the jury commission did not account for the fact
that the Hispanic population—less than one percent of the population in 1990—had grown
exponentially between 1990 and 2000. By 2000, Hispanics accounted for nearly one-fifth of
Hall County’s total population (US Census Bureau 2000).
The trial judge ruled against Smith with regard to the grand jury challenge, noting that the
grand jury composition was correctly comprised based on 1990 Census numbers (the grand jury
indicted Smith eight months prior to the release of the 2000 Census data). In the case of the
traverse jury, however, the judge ruled that the jury commission had access to 2000 Census data
when compiling Smith’s traverse jury list. Since adult Hispanics comprised 17.1 percent of the
Hall County adult population, but likely only a tiny fraction of the jury pool, the venire did not
meet the fair cross section standard.
It is worth noting that the degree to which Hispanics were underrepresented in Hall
County’s jury pool was a subject of dispute in the case. Because the Hall County jury
commission did not collect data on potential jurors’ Hispanic origin, there was no way to
conclusively determine how many people in the jury pool were Hispanic. The defense conducted
a Hispanic surname analysis—a widely used and well-validated technique for identifying

Smith v. State 9

Hispanics within a larger population (Abrahamse, Morrison & Bolton 1994)—of the more than
20,000 names in the pool, and found that only two known Hispanic names (less than .01 percent
of the jury pool) were on the list. However, the judge sided with the prosecution, who argued that
all members of the jury pool who reported their race as “other” should be considered Hispanic,
excluding the possibility that some jury pool members might have been Asian or American
Indian. From this perspective, it was determined that 2.6 percent of the jury pool was Hispanic.
Still, 2.6 percent on the jury pool fell far short of the 17.1 percent of the Hall County population
enumerated as Hispanic adults. With this ruling, the trial judge in the Smith case became the first
judge in Georgia to recognize Hispanics as a distinctive group for the purpose of jury selection.
In response to this decision, prosecutors in the Smith case petitioned the Georgia Supreme
Court for a ruling on whether or not the trial court correctly found that Hispanics were a
distinctive group and whether or not the trial court correctly found that Hispanics had been
systematically excluded from jury pool selection. The court unanimously upheld the trial court’s
finding of Hispanics as a distinctive group that must be accounted for in creating a jury pool. In a
6 to 1 decision, however, the Justices ruled that the trial court’s finding of systematic exclusion
was unfounded. Justice P. Harris Hines, who wrote the decision, noted:
To establish a prima facie case of a fair-cross-section Sixth Amendment violation,
Smith had to show an actionable disparity between the percentage of Hispanics on
the traverse jury list and the percentage of Hispanics in Hall County who are juryeligible . . . [Smith] based his percentage of jury-eligible Hall County Hispanics
on census numbers showing that the number of over-18 Hall County Hispanics
was 17,424, but the evidence showed that the over-18 Hispanics who are U.S.

Smith v. State 10

citizens, and thus eligible to serve on juries, amounts to a small fraction of that
number. Even a generous assumption… that a fifth of the over-18 Hispanics in
Hall County are U.S. citizens, still leaves the absolute disparity between the
percentage of Hispanics on the traverse jury list and the percentage of jury-eligible
Hispanics in Hall County at only 0.82%, well within constitutional bounds . . . The
trial court erred by finding that Smith had satisfied the second prong of the Sixth
Amendment fair-cross-section test (Smith v. Georgia [2002], p. 747).
In essence, the Supreme Court found that jury representation for Hispanics should be based on
citizenship, since many Hispanics in Hall County were non-citizen immigrants. Although this
requirement may seem reasonable on its face—after all, only citizens can serve on juries—the
decision creates disparity. The citizenship standard is not applied to other groups; thus, the
decision requires jury commissions to hold Hispanics to a different standard. The decision also
suggests that residents of a county can be denied equal protection if they are not yet citizens.
The lone dissenting Justice, Robert Benham, recognized some of the problems inherent
in the majority decision. In his dissenting opinion, Benham wrote:
In a heterogeneous society such as ours, jurors charged with reaching decisions
on matters that are not readily subject to scientific proof but are influenced by
public policy, shared values, and facts that are oftentimes in conflict, must often
take into consideration cultural differences, traditions, customs, and mores before a
final determination can be made. Placing undue restrictions on the jury pool
selection process by forcing jury commissioners to use only methods that prescreen for citizenship could result in the exclusion of many citizens who are

Smith v. State 11

potential candidates for jury service. Such a state of affairs might not bode well
for our system of justice. The majority approach will cause jury commissioners to
short circuit their quest for a more representative jury pool and stifle attempts to
make our jury pools more inclusive. This is the very problem the U.S. Supreme
Court sought to remedy in Duren.5 We need to learn from our mistakes of the past
and not feel duty bound to repeat them (Smith v. Georgia [2002], pp. 751-752).
We argue that the Smith ruling represents a type of institutionalized racism arising in new
Hispanic destinations. First, we examine how existing legal and practical precedents for meeting
the fair cross section rule created conditions for systematic discrimination against Hispanics in
new destinations. Next, we discuss how a lack of understanding of the Hispanic community and
immigrant assimilation created a foundation for the citizenship requirement in the Smith decision.
Finally, we demonstrate how the implementation of the Smith decision in Georgia, abetted by
common procedural practices such as jury forced balancing and sole reliance on decennial census
data for evaluating community composition, has exacerbated the exclusion of Hispanics from fair
cross sectional representation in legal proceedings since 2002. This court logic creates conditions
for concentrating disproportionately high levels of criminal justice control and imprisonment
among minority and Hispanic populations through their non-inclusion in jury decision-making.
A “Fair” Cross Section for Hispanics
The sixth amendment to the Constitution declares that “the accused shall enjoy the right to a
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury” in criminal prosecutions. The requirement of jury
impartiality led to the Duren v. Missouri (1979) ruling that jury pools must represent a fair cross
section of the community. In Georgia, fair-cross section has two prongs: (1) group distinctiveness

Smith v. State 12

and (2) proportional representation. Group distinctiveness can vary from court to court. In Avery
v. Georgia (1953) and Reece v. Georgia (1955), the court held that blacks could not be
systematically and intentionally excluded from jury selection. Women were guaranteed jury
representation in Sanders v. Georgia (1976). With Smith v. Georgia (2002), the courts added
Hispanics and non-Hispanics to the list of distinctive groups in Georgia.
The recognition of Hispanics as distinctive was an important step toward expanding
notions of racial and ethnic equality, particularly in a state with little previous experience with
Hispanics and a tendency to ignore the minority status of these newcomers (Bohon, 2006; Neal &
Bohon, 2003). However, the application of the second prong—more specifically, the Justices’
parameters regarding how proportional representation should be applied—eradicated any gains
made by elevating Hispanics as a distinctive class. Case law requires that a distinctive class’
representation in a jury pool reflects its proportional makeup of the adult population (Avery v.
Georgia [1953]), but the courts also recognize that population sampling results in a discrepancy
between the sample and the population (Swain v. Alabama [1965])—a difference referred to by
statisticians as sampling error. Thus, courts established rules about how large discrepancies can
be before exclusion is no longer considered accidental, but systematic (Re, 2007).
Sampling error is an inevitable outcome of sampling (c.f. Yammarino, Skinner &
Childers, 1991). However, Georgia’s methods for compiling jury pools at the time of Smith
would not have yielded sampling error because the venire was not sampled; it was forced
balanced (Simmons, 2012). That is, county-level jury commissioners constructed their jury pool
from a list of registered voters. They then removed certain classes of people from the pool until
the composition of distinctive groups in the pool proportionally matched the adult population of

Smith v. State 13

the county.6 We examined jury pools in 15 counties and noted that the absolute disparity for
each distinctive group was less than one percent in each pool; this underscores that forced
balancing creates absolute disparity close to zero.
Despite the state-wide practice of forced balancing, and, thus, the absence of sampling
error, the court determined in Morrow v. Georgia (2000) that “an absolute disparity between the
percentage of a group in the population and its percentage in the jury pool of less than 5% is
almost always constitutional; an absolute disparity between 5% and 10% is usually constitutional;
and an absolute disparity of over 10% is probably unconstitutional” (Golden 2004, p. 3). Absolute
disparity refers to the total difference between a group’s percent representation in the population
and its percent representation in the jury pool. Thus, if women are 45 percent of the population
but 35 percent of the jury pool, the absolute disparity is 10 percent (45-35=10), which is “usually
constitutional.” Georgia courts use a “five percent rule” when certifying jury pool certificates.
That is, if the absolute disparity between a distinctive group in the population—as determined by
the US Census Bureau—and their representation on the jury pool is less than five percent, courts
will certify the pool as constitutional.
In the subsequent sections, we contend that the five percent rule, the standard of absolute
disparity, and the methods for determining population size exemplify how the judicial system is
structured to confer privilege to the advantaged. First, absolute disparity understates the degree to
which groups are underrepresented if the group is small relative to the overall population, and use
of this standard enables intentional and systematic exclusion to be “almost always constitutional.”
Second, the five percent rule allows judges to ignore Hispanic populations even when Hispanics
outnumber other “distinctive” groups, and its arbitrariness allows judges to ignore Hispanic

Smith v. State 14

populations, even when Hispanics outnumber other “distinctive” groups. Third, using the
decennial census as the sole basis for determining population size ignores the fact that Hispanics
are particularly likely to be undercounted in the US Census and guarantees underrepresentation
of Hispanics in counties where the Hispanic population is growing rapidly.
The Five Percent Rule and the Distortions of Absolute Disparity
Fair cross section standards were instituted to guarantee minority representation in jury selection,
but the evaluation of fair cross section using absolute disparity and the five percent rule actually
discriminates against groups that are truly minority, defined as small relative to the dominant
group. In fact, legal scholars have argued that “using either of the two most common methods of
representation (absolute disparity and comparative disparity) would create ‘safe harbors’ in which
the courts in a majority of jurisdictions across the country would become effectively immune
from fair-cross-section challenges” (Hannaford-Agor & Waters, 2011, p. 762).
Regardless of a group’s total numbers, groups that do not comprise at least five percent of
the population can be ignored in jury selection. Under the five percent rule, completely
excluding a group under these conditions—even intentionally—is “almost always
constitutional.” In Gwinnett County, Georgia—which has an adult population in excess of
570,000 according to the 2010 Census—a distinctive group would have to comprise more than
28,000 adult members before its complete exclusion from the jury pool would provide evidence
of systematic exclusion under the five percent rule.
Table 1 shows the size of the Hispanic adult population in the Georgia counties with the
largest Hispanic presence in 2010. The table shows how an absolute disparity between the size
of the adult Hispanic population and zero (a hypothetical representation of Hispanics in the jury

Smith v. State 15

pool if all Hispanics were blocked from jury participation) would be evaluated under Morrow.
[Table 1 about here]
The degree to which absolute disparity can be distorted by relative population size is
obvious in a comparison of Atkinson and Chatham counties, two Georgia counties with 1,209 and
9,986 adult Hispanics, respectively, as of the 2010 Census. The absolute disparity in Atkinson
County, if no Hispanics were in the jury pool, would be 20.3 percent. By contrast, in Chatham
County, where Hispanics outnumber those in Atkinson County by eight to one, the absolute
disparity would o nl y be 4.9 percent if Hispanics were purposely excluded from jury selection;
this complete exclusion would be considered “almost always constitutional.”
Hispanics are the nation’s largest minority group, and Georgia is the nation’s largest new
destination for Hispanics (Bohon, 2006). The 2010 Census reports almost 900,000 Hispanics
living in Georgia, a sub-population larger than the total population of some US states (US Census
Bureau, 2010). Since 2000, all of Georgia’s 159 counties had at least some Hispanic presence; in
many counties, the Hispanic population doubled between 2000 and 2010. Moreover, Georgia has
one of the nation’s largest black populations and a sizeable Asian population. Despite this large
minority presence, if every Georgia county refused to seat Hispanics in their jury pools, this
would produce absolute disparities that are “almost always constitutional” in 108 counties,
“usually constitutional” in 37 counties, and “probably unconstitutional” in only 14 counties.
The constitutionality of absolute disparity has been challenged repeatedly. In 2010, the
US Supreme Court heard arguments in Berghuis v. Smith in which counsel for Diapolis Smith
argued that the absolute disparity standard made it impossible for the jury selection system to
violate the fair cross section provision until a minority group reached at least 10 percent of the

Smith v. State 16

population (blacks comprised 7.28 percent of the county where Diapolis Smith was convicted).
Smith’s counsel argued for the use of comparative disparity, a measure that would calculate truer
underrepresentation. That is, if a population is 8 percent black, but the jury pool is only 4 percent
black, the absolute disparity would be 4 percent but the comparative disparity (the degree to
which the sample proportion does not match the population proportion) would be 50 percent. In
Smith v. Georgia (2002), the absolute disparity between the over-18 Hispanic population and the
percent of Hispanics in the jury pool was at least 14.5 percent, and the comparative disparity was
85 percent. That is, there were at least 85 percent fewer Hispanics in the jury pool than we would
expect from random selection of the population. However, in Smith v. Georgia, as in Berghuis v.
Smith, the Courts rejected the notion that absolute disparity standards should be reconsidered.
There are few Georgia counties where the Hispanic adult population exceeds five percent
of the total adult population and even fewer where Hispanics exceed ten percent, even in places
like Chatham County, which has nearly 10,000 adult Hispanics. Judges have thus used the Smith
decision to strike down fair cross section challenges of Hispanic jury pool representation in
counties where Hispanics are less than ten percent of the population. In Gordon County, for
example, a judge determined that jury commissioners did not have to account for Hispanics, since
the difference between the percent of Hispanics in the population and their percent in the jury pool
(zero) was only seven percent in 2000.7 Despite the fact that Hispanics outnumbered blacks two
to one in Gordon County, the jury commission certified a jury pool in which the percent of blacks
exactly equaled black representation in the county. In excluding non-citizens from the Hispanic
counts, Hispanic representation need legally occur in only seven of Georgia’s 159 counties.8
Using the Decennial Census to Determine Group Size

Smith v. State 17

The problems with the five percent rule are exacerbated by the court’s exclusive use of the
decennial census to calculate disparity. The Census Bureau collects information on the
population in two forms. The short form captures basic data for 100 percent of the population.
The long form (now the American Community Survey [ACS]) collects detailed data on a sample
of the population. Although the short form is administered every ten years, the ACS is
administered every year. Thus, the ACS captures important changes to the population in the
years between the decennial censuses.
The Justices in the Smith case put great store in the decennial census numbers and
reasonably argued that jury commissions should not be expected to hit a “moving target” (p.
745). They ruled that only the decennial census should be considered in fair cross section
challenges. Thus, counties that experience a sizeable minority influx in the ten years between
censuses do not have an obligation to meet sixth amendment standards until new census data are
collected and released. In Georgia, the Hispanic population grew nearly 300 percent between
1990 and 2000. Ignoring growth between Census years disadvantages minorities, especially
Hispanics, because these sub-populations grow rapidly.
Citizenship Requirements and the Impact on the Black Population
Removing non-citizen Hispanics from the population base is discriminatory because non-citizens
are not removed from the population base of any other groups. For example, in Gwinnett County
alone there are 36,925 non-citizen, non-Hispanic white adults according to the ACS. There are
also 10,771 non-citizen black adults. In fact, Georgia is a primary receiving destination for
African immigrants, most of whom are black, and few of whom are citizens (Takougang, 2003).
Yet, each of these non-citizens is counted in the black population base.

Smith v. State 18

Other racialized factors are also at work. In the majority decision, the phrase “juryeligible” was used twelve times. Presumably this underscores the fact that non-citizens are not
eligible to sit on juries. However, jury-eligibility is a standard applied only to Hispanics. In this
vein, a distasteful argument could be made that the black base population should be reduced to
reflect its disproportionately high rates of incarceration (Alexander, 2012). Similarly, the white
population could be reduced to reflect the high number of whites in nursing homes (Charles &
Sevak, 2005). In other words, jury eligibility (and the reasons for ineligibility) varies by race
and ethnicity; singling out citizenship is arguably anti-Hispanic.
The institution of the Smith ruling in jury balancing in Hall County also has implications
for black representation in jury pools. To illustrate this, we created four hypothetical scenarios
for the population composition based on the 2010 population of DeKalb County. We use
DeKalb, rather than Hall County, because DeKalb has a sizable black population. The scenarios
are illustrated in Table 2.
[Table 2 about here]
Scenario 1 illustrates the composition of DeKalb County if Hispanics were considered a
cognizable group but no consideration was given for citizenship status (i.e., if Hispanics were
treated as all other groups). In this scenario, Hispanic adults are 8.5 percent of the population
and would comprise close to 8.5 percent of a forced balanced jury pool. Scenario 2 uses DeKalb
County data to illustrate how Hall County juries were balanced in the years immediately
following Smith. In this scenario, Hispanic non-citizens are removed from the Hispanic subpopulation, reducing their proportionate representation to 2.4 percent. With the exception of
non-Hispanics, no distinctive groups are affected, although they should be.

Smith v. State 19

The problem with Scenario 2 (i.e., the Smith decision in practice) is that non-citizen
Hispanics are also men, women, black, white, and other race people. Thus, non-citizen
Hispanics should be removed not only from the Hispanic group, but from all other groups as
well. However, doing so requires more information. In Scenario 3, we reduced the total male
and female populations by the number of non-citizen, adult Hispanic men and women,
respectively. We then tried to reduce the total number of adult blacks by the total number of
black Hispanic non-citizens in the county, but we were unable to do so because such small
numbers are suppressed by the Census Bureau. For this reason, race categories are not adjusted.
Scenario 4 demonstrates the magnitude of failing to adjust by race. In this Scenario, we
adjusted all categories to eliminate non-citizens, regardless of whether or not these non-citizens
are Hispanic. In doing so, the proportionality of the gender groups does not change significantly,
but the racial proportions change substantially. Blacks, who comprise 52 percent of the
population when citizenship is ignored (Scenario 1), account for 57 percent of the population
when citizenship is considered for all groups. Thus, the failure to account for non-citizens
among all racial groups disadvantages non-Hispanic blacks as well as Hispanics.
Conclusion
Just as structural racism operates without conscious and intentional racist actors to encode racial
disparities at a broad societal level, institutions within that society enact policies that contribute to
and reproduce racialized outcomes. The law is a significant site for this reproduction, and new
destinations set the stage. In the case of Smith v. Georgia, the Supreme Court Justices extended
representation in jury pools to Hispanics, but they placed parameters around their representation
that do not similarly restrict other distinctive groups. The stated basis for the Smith decision—

Smith v. State 20

primarily the five percent rule—was founded on a color-blind legal precedent of citizenship.
However, the majority’s concern about non-citizen Hispanics in the absence of concern for nonHispanic non-citizens is overtly exclusionary in effect, thus reproducing racialized outcomes,
including increasing the disproportionate presence of minorities in the criminal justice system.
Georgia’s courts have a long history of racial bias in sentencing (Stevenson & Friedman
1994), and the US Supreme Court has often shrugged at overwhelming evidence of judicial racial
bias, referring to racism as “an inevitable part of our criminal justice system” (McCleskey v. Kemp
[1987]). An irony in the Smith case is that the Georgia Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s
decision that recognized that a fair cross section of a population had to include the section
represented by Hispanics. However, by reifying the five percent rule and placing citizenship
restrictions solely on Hispanic representation, the courts created a policy that reproduced racial
disparities. In doing so, Hispanics can be rendered invisible in the legal system (except as
criminal defendants) in new destination places where they are hyper-visible.
It is impossible to predict the long-term consequences of restricting Hispanic
representation in juries, but many factors suggest a poor outcome. First, multiple pathways to
citizenship for immigrants—many of whom are Hispanic—remain blocked, and immigration
reform has stalled indefinitely. We can therefore expect that Hispanics will continue to be
underrepresented in jury venires now and into the future. Second, the increasing criminalization
of Hispanic immigrants (Conley, 2013), combined with the courts’ apparent lack of concern that
defendants are heard by a jury comprised of a fair cross section of the population, poses an
alarming potential for the ongoing mass incarceration of minorities (Bowers, Steiner & Sandys,
2001) and the deportation of Hispanic immigrants. Finally, changes in case law, such as those

Smith v. State 21

seen in Smith, represent a form of macroagression that creates structural vulnerabilities for
Hispanics, resulting in increased stress and worry and leading immigrants to feel marginalized.

Endnotes
In this manuscript, we use the term “Hispanic” to mean Hispanic and/or Latino. Although we
prefer Latino, we chose Hispanic over Latino for simplicity and consistency, because this term is
used exclusively in the legal decisions upon which this study is based.
1

2

Although the US government has maintained that Hispanics and Latinos do not constitute a
race, per se, we assert that, as a social construct, any reasonable definition of race would place
Hispanics and Latinos into a racial category. Thus, theories of race and racism are applicable to
Hispanics and Latinos as a group, and it is appropriate to examine Hispanics and Latinos through
a race lens.
3

New destinations and new Hispanic destinations are places (counties, states, or metropolitan
areas) that now have a sizable presence of immigrants or Hispanics, respectively, but had little
previous experience with these groups in the past.
4

Georgia law established “African Americans” as a distinctive group; however, in practice, all
blacks living in a jurisdiction (whether or not they are Americans) are included in this class, so
we use “black” throughout to underscore this point.
5

In Duren v. Missouri (1979), the US Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for states
to make jury duty optional for women because the practice was based on an underlying notion
that women’s service is less valuable then men’s.
6

In 2012, Georgia changed their jury pool selection process by centralizing jury pool creation at
the state level and removing forced balancing. Georgia was the last US state to discontinue the
use of forced balancing (Simmons, 2012). This move—which was enacted by the state
legislature, rather than the courts—does not nullify the Smith ruling, since jury pools still have to
balance in a way that reflects only citizen Hispanics.

The first author served as an expert witness in the Gordon County case.

It is impossible to adjust the Hispanic population for citizenship in counties with very small
populations, because the Census Bureau suppresses those numbers due to confidentiality
concerns. In those counties, the Smith decision is impossible to apply. However, we adjusted
the numbers based on the assumption that every non-citizen in the smallest counties was
Hispanic in order to obtain our calculations. Although it is unlikely that every non-citizen in
every small county is Latino, employing this assumption has little impact on our calculations,
since there are few non-citizens in the smallest counties, and the counties with very few Latinos
do not reach the five percent threshold with regard to Latinos.
