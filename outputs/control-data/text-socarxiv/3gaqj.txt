ABSTRACT

4

Consisting of formal and informal rules, cultural-cognitive schema, and routinized processes, institutions

5

are the foundation of social life. Yet we do not have a systematic understanding of resistant roots of

6

institutional diversity across societies. Following an evolutionary framework, we review the literature and

7

discuss how a series of mutually exclusive and sequential “replicators” have come to jointly predispose

8

human behaviors. Through social transmission, these replicators form lineages, which contribute to

9

different levels of societies. We suggest that our review can provide a new research agenda regarding

10

human behaviors in the social sciences. Limitations are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

20

Defined generally as a diverse set of formal and informal rules, routinized processes, and (in

21

organizational institutionalism) cognitive-cultural schema, institutions shape human behaviors (2-7).

22

There has been an ample literature on institutions across multiple social science disciplines [for a review,

23

see, e.g., Campbell, (2004)]. Yet we do not have an integrative conceptual framework to organize a

24

fragmented literature and evidence on resistant roots of institutional diversity across societies.

25

In this paper, generally following Hodgson and Knudsen (8)’s evolutionary framework, we

26

review the literature and address the question: What are the resistant roots in institutional diversity across

27

societies? We break this question down into its two components: (1) resistant roots in a society’s

28

institutions; (2) boundaries of societies defined by shared institutions. More specifically, we review the

29

discussions and evidence in the literature and group findings into a series of mutually exclusive and

30

sequential “social replicators” that predispose the patterns of human behaviors. These replicators

31

continuously reproduce or preserve over time predisposed patterns of human behaviors. Each new

32

replicator emerged historically as a critical juncture in social evolution and remains resistant to further

33

changes. They self-reproduce at a relatively high precision, which leads to preservation of the behavioral

34

and social patterns over time and across human populations. Together, these replicators play a salient

35

impact on modern-day human behaviors and social relations.

36

Throughout the paper, we first briefly review the evolutionary framework of replicators (Hodgson

37

& Knudsen, 2010) that emerged in an evolutionary sequence, namely: genes, pre-linguistic habits,

38

grammatical languages, customs, writing systems, judicial systems, and scientific paradigms. Then we

39

review the literature to discuss how each replicator predisposes patterns of human behaviors and thus
2

40

serves a resistant root in the institutions of a society. We further discuss how the transmission of each

41

replicator draws lineages and thus forms the boundaries of a society. Lastly, we discuss implications of

42

our review for a future agenda concerning human behaviors – a common issue concerning many social

43

sciences.

44

AN EVOLUTIONARY FRAMEWORK

45

Evolutionary theorizing has been adopted in both natural and social sciences to explain diversity (8-16). It

46

is a theoretical device to examine the underlying factors in the processes and patterns of adaptive changes

47

over time or in history, which usually transform a population (e.g., species, organizations, societies) from

48

simpler into more complex forms (9, 10). There is a long tradition of evolutionary theorizing about

49

cultural, social, and economic phenomena as well as biological, even before Charles Darwin (9), although

50

not all scholars agree on the value of a generalized form of Darwinism across all fields of study (which

51

issue lies beyond the scope of our study). As suggested by Mesoudi (11), the Darwinian formulation that

52

is common to many evolutionary approaches is to propose a sequence that begins with some process of

53

variation within a population of some entity (e.g., species, organizations, or societies), leading to selection

54

by the environment, and then to the retention and reproduction (or inheritance) of selected varieties.

55

Evolutionary theorists often draw lineages to define the boundaries between categories such as

56

species, or in our context to distinguish between societies. To characterize and map lineages, a basic

57

concept in evolutionary theorizing about retention or reproduction is a replicator. A replicator is a resilient

58

program or set of codes and a self-reproducing unit of heredity (e.g., a gene) (15), which confers adaptive

59

solutions to problems or constraints as they continuously arise, and so guides the development of the

60

entity or the system with which it is associated (17, 18). Replicators are hosted by a relatively cohesive

61

entity (such as an individual, an organization, or a society), usually termed a “interactor”, which interacts

62

with its selection environment in ways that lead to changes in the population of interactors and their

63

replicators (17, 18). Replicators copy or reproduce themselves through a cumulative and iterative

64

replication process, leading to distinct lineages, and hence to diversity and complexity (12, 13, 15). When

65

expressed in these replicator-interactor terms, evolution proceeds through the sequence of variation in the
3

66

replicators of a population, followed by an environmental selection of these varieties as they are

67

represented through the interactors (8, 11), and which varied replicators are inherently capable of

68

reproducing or sustaining themselves.

69

A social replicator differs from a biological replicator in a few ways. A biological replicator such

70

as a gene meets the criteria of longevity, fecundity, replicative fidelity, and stability (15). In “routines as

71

genes”, Nelson and Winter (19) suggested considering organizational routines of behavior as a social

72

replicator. A social replicator meets a similar condition for a capacity for self-reproduction, but follows

73

different and relatively less restrictive criteria, including a capacity to copy itself, similarity with a copied

74

self, information transfer or retention, and resistance to change (8, 20). A biological replicator can be

75

thought as a special case of social replicators in that it meets a more strictly set of standards.

76

Compared to biological replicators, whose random mutation in the process of reproduction is

77

relatively rare, variations in social replicators tend to occur more frequently, whether through random

78

(blind) mutation or guided modification through an active entrepreneurial agent (9-11). Unlike Darwinian

79

biological replication, social replication follows a Lamarckian form of inheritance, that is, replicators may

80

be acquired by an interactor and then deliberately or intentionally replicated to succeeding generations

81

(11). This is because the prescriptions in a social replicator are relatively accessible and modifiable by its

82

carriers (e.g., human individuals, organizations, etc.), whereas it is difficult, if not impossible, for a

83

species to access and modify their own genes’ prescriptions (with the potential change by clustered

84

regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]).

85
86

BIO-ECOLOGICAL ROOTS
In the absence of social replicators, humans are just like other animal species, predisposed by an

87

individual’s biologically inherited and inborn traits (codified and replicated through genes), which

88

interact with ecological conditions (e.g., geography, climate, etc.) to form behaviors (21). Behavioral

89

geneticists have made significant progress in linking genetic influences to human behaviors (22-27). On

90

the one hand, all humans today may share a common ancestral population in East Africa about 100,000

91

years ago (28-30). Some psychological and behavioral traits such as the social conformity and imitation
4

92

biases of our common ancestors were likely adaptive mental models that were attuned to their particular

93

wild natural environments (11). Present-day generations have genetically inherited these traits in the form

94

of “universal preferences” or “evolved psychology” (31, 32). On the other hand, our genetic differences,

95

although small (less than 1%), may play a significant role in our individual differences in behaviors. For

96

instance, in a recent meta-analysis of 62 independent effect sizes and 100,000 participants, Vukasović and

97

Bratko (33) estimated that 40% of individual differences in personality were due to genetic influences. As

98

another example, Hatemi, Medland (34) studied 12,000 twin pairs and found that they had significant

99

similarities in their attraction to political ideologies.

100

For their role as behavioral predispositions, genes across human populations are a biological root

101

in institutional diversity. Specifically, without genetic engineering (e.g., CRISPR), human genes are

102

transmitted vertically from biological parents (half from each), and thus the genetic roots on institutions

103

run through biological families. In this way, genes of individuals are “synthesized” into biological family

104

lineages – a primitive and basic unit of a society. Because of this pathway of transmission, the scope of

105

genetic diffusion is limited to biological family lineages. While most genetically related people live in the

106

same geographically-bounded community, the boundary of a family lineage does not have to stop at any

107

geographic borders. One obvious example is the widespread Caucasian population around the globe. An

108

opposite example is that many aboriginal people have lived in small isolated areas for generations within

109

a subnational region (e.g., bands in Papua New Guinea). Genetic variation between lineages may cause

110

subjective barriers such as discrimination and miscommunication (especially if racial marks are

111

observable) (35), thus hindering social interactions and the diffusion of other replicators (36). Burns and

112

Sommerville (37), for instance, find that Caucasian infants tend to incorporate racial similarity (Caucasian

113

vs. Asian) into their selection of social partners. At the population level, genetic diversity is found to be

114

negatively related to the degree of interpersonal trust (28).

115

Genetic diversity alone does not explain institutional diversity but interacts with ecological

116

conditions to do so. Social replicators emerged essentially as adaptive tools for human genes to populate

117

(38). The resilience of replicators is an adaptive response to the persistent genetic-ecological conditions
5

118

that have selected them (38, 39). There has been ample empirical evidence to partially support that

119

ecological conditions are related to the diversity in social replicators. Among the earliest field works was

120

Diamond (40), who found that the climate factors might explain the emergence of early European

121

civilization. More specifically, there has been discussion and empirical evidence in the literature to

122

attribute bio-ecological conditions as a determinant in social replicators. First, on pre-linguistic habits,

123

Talhelm, Zhang (41) found that collectivist social habits in certain parts of China are associated with local

124

people’s historical reliance on a cooperative system of large-scale agriculture such as growing rice.

125

Second, on grammatical languages, as another example, Galor, Özak (42) found that pre-industrial

126

geographical and agricultural characteristics were the root causes of modern cross-language variations in

127

their structure of the future tense and the presence of grammatical gender and politeness distinctions.

128

Third, two recent empirical studies, Spolaore and Wacziarg (43) and Gutmann and Voigt (44), found strong

129

correlations between judicial/legal systems and bio-ecological conditions of a country. The former, based

130

on 4,560 country pairs from 96 countries, found empirical evidence that differences in democracy score

131

were statistically significantly related to genetic and geographic distance. The latter studied 99 countries

132

and found that the rule of law index was statistically significantly related to ethnic fractionalization,

133

geography (e.g., absolute latitude, climate, landlock or island), and a bio-ecological composite based on

134

number of annual/perennial wild grasses and number of domesticable big mammals.

135

SOCIAL REPLICATOR ROOTS

136

Drawing upon an extensive review of evolutionary studies in multiple disciplines (e.g., 9, 10, 13, 15, 17),

137

Hodgson and Knudsen (2010) proposed a hierarchy of six social replicators for social evolution.

138

Sequentially, they are pre-linguistic habits, grammatical languages, customs, writing systems, judicial

139

systems, and scientific paradigms, each of which can be seen as a consequence of the interaction between

140

earlier replicators and an interactor’s (i.e., a society’s) selection environment.

141

Definitions

142
143

Pre-linguistic Habits

Habits are recurring behavioral tendencies and they may automatically

repeat in relatively familiar and unchanged contexts unintentionally and non-volitionally (45). The
6

144

emergence of pre-linguistic habits of social interactions (hereafter “habits”) such as sounds, body

145

languages, and facial expressions and the underlying habits of thought marks the first major information

146

technology in social evolution (8). We humans build up habits of thought and communications in infancy

147

by associating nonverbal signals with social meanings (14, 46).

148

Grammatical Languages

Enabled by some pre-linguistic habits such as sound patterns and

149

gestures that allowed phonology, languages emerged in order to extend simple symbols into more

150

complicated and grammatical messages (47). Grammatical languages are found to be unique to humans

151

(48), as distinct from the extent of any utterances and speech of other animals (49). Such languages

152

consist of a universal system of linguistic rules (50), that include giving semantic meanings to symbols

153

related to the basic cognitive categories of intuitive concepts, and creating a structure of morphology and

154

syntax which assemble and organize these concepts (47, 48).

155

Customs

Grammatical languages enable small groups such as families and bands to

156

eventually transition into larger-scale tribes as a result of the establishment of settled communities (39).

157

With an increasing population density, complex interpersonal relations, and potential threat from

158

neighboring societies, communal activities such as conventions and traditions emerged to share special

159

social meanings, forming customs (38, 51). Well before the emergence of modern civilizations, customs

160

emerged and became shared in tribal societies as new social norms that helped to stabilize increasingly

161

complex social relations in a growing society (8). Customs made it possible to formulate and stabilize

162

social relations such as social status, hierarchy and the division of labor, which enabled charismatic

163

leaders and surrounding elites (precursors of local chiefs and bureaucracies) to emerge and to maintain

164

internal group cohesion and to negotiate intergroup relationships (51). Gradually, kinship-based tribal

165

relations transitioned into codes and norms designed to solve social problems on a larger scale and at a

166

higher level of complexity (52). As an example, kinship-based beliefs in the afterlife of their common

167

ancestors gave way to communal worship of a supernatural being or a spirit guide in the pursuit of some

168

universally desirable characteristics (e.g., physical strength, fertility, harvest, etc.) on a larger scale (39,

169

53).
7

170

Writing Systems From the beginnings of communal communications in societies writing systems

171

emerged, and they are often taken to represent the start of human civilization (54). Writing systems

172

essentially are the written symbols of spoken languages (Diamond, 1998), with each written unit

173

representing a single basic sound or phoneme (alphabetical, abjad or abugida systems), a whole syllable

174

(syllabic systems), or a whole word (logographic systems) (55-57). Writing was adopted for its

175

advantages over verbal languages and the merely verbal and artistic forms of customs, because it is

176

possible to store and transmit relatively symbolic and standardized information through an enduring

177

media (e.g., stone, paper, computer, etc.), where knowledge may thereby be better preserved beyond a

178

person’s or a society’s life.

179

Judicial Systems and Laws

Norms of morality and justice embodied in customs are not

180

easily transmittable and enforceable in a large population, until their underlying principles become

181

articulated and codified into laws (58). Here we focus on judicial laws that are written into codes and

182

enforced by the state, as distinct from customary laws that rely primarily on verbal means. While an

183

effective judicial system requires coercive enforcement by a state, it is also enabled by earlier replicators,

184

such as our predisposition to conform to authority (11), our innate instinct to punish violations of

185

reciprocity and fairness (59), pre-existing customary laws in the absence of government (60), and writing

186

systems as a means of social control (61).

187

Scientific Paradigms

Since at least Copernicus, science has constantly challenged

188

conventional customs, beliefs and laws, using reliable observations, mathematically disciplined reasoning,

189

and highly articulated languages (62). While there is a continual long-standing controversy over the

190

definition of science (63), we follow Kuhn (64)’s concept of “paradigms”, because of their resistance and

191

highly precise replication across individuals and over time – which is the essence of a social replicator.

192

Paradigms define the foundational logics and empirical methodologies, upon which scientific knowledge

193

progresses (64). These paradigms provide a solid basis for further research because they are sufficiently

194

unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from alternative views of the world, and yet

195

open-ended enough to leave much in need of resolution through continuing research programs (64).
8

196

Paradigms define legitimate problems and methods for a research field for succeeding generations (64).

197

Within a paradigm, a community of scholars and practitioners emerges that uses a common language and

198

accepts modes and protocols for investigations (65). Aristotle’s Physica, Newton’s Principia and Opticks,

199

Franklin’s Electricity, and Smith’s Wealth of Nations, can all be said to be such paradigms in which their

200

respective disciplines and subfields of science have been grounded.

201

Social Evolution

202

At the society level, these replicators follow the sequence of social evolution in human history

203

(and often acquired following the same order by a person throughout a life time). The addition of new

204

replicators may also cause changes in the nature and role of earlier replicators once they are combined

205

into a new system, since each new system synthesizes in a novel way inherited and more recently

206

emerged elements. The sequencing of these institutional features of human societies also seems to

207

coincide with the structure of cognitive development of individuals in their learning processes.

208

Specifically, each of these replicators is sequentially acquired over a person’s development from infancy

209

and remains enabled and constrained by earlier ones. In this way, these replicators are not only salient

210

factors from a historical perspective on the evolution of societies, but they also remain integral to our

211

modern way of life.

212

For social replicators to be resistant roots like bio-ecological conditions in institutions of a society,

213

two criteria must be met for a social replicator. First, its behavioral prescriptions must be resistant to

214

change. That is, like genes, each social replicator rarely mutates. Second, it plays an enduring role in

215

behavioral predispositions, thus as an enduring part of institutions, predisposing patterns of human

216

behaviors.

217

Resistance to Mutate

218

Pre-linguistic habits They come from repeatedly practiced behaviors that are liable to be stored

219

in procedural memories, which are typically those that are “less subject to decay, less explicitly accessible,

220

and less easy to transfer to novel circumstances” (66: 557). Over time habits become automatic responses

221

and require minimal attention, deliberate control or resources for information search and learning, and
9

222

come to represent a baseline reaction to triggering environmental events (45, 67). They constrain any

223

desire for changes because a new intention requires “sufficient strength and […] skill to override well-

224

practiced behavior” as well as “continued effort” (45). Therefore, people tend to find it very difficult to

225

change their habits, even if such a change is driven by a rational intention, such as unhealthy habits of diet

226

(68).

227

Programmatic languages Evolutionary linguists suggest that languages are a culturally

228

transmitted replicator, characterized by a relatively slow rate of change (69, 70). For instance, focusing on

229

Indo-European languages, Pagel (69) estimated that there was only 0.009 to 0.93 new cognate (defined by

230

shared vocabularies and grammars) per 1,000 years, with a mean of 0.3±0.18, and that the half-life of a

231

cognate is between 750 to 76,000 years, with a mean of 5,300 years. In addition, new languages within

232

the Indo-European set appear on average only every 500-1000 years (69). While punctuational bursts are

233

sometimes observed in language evolution in part to strengthen social identity and cohesion (e.g.,

234

Webster English), they occur very infrequently and may count for a minor portion of linguist evolution:

235

e.g., 31% in the Bantu languages, 21% in the Indo-European, and 9.5% in the Austronesian (71). In fact,

236

core vocabularies and grammars that are frequently used tend to be continually corrected from deviation

237

from their established norms, and thus relatively conserved over time (69, 72).

238

Customs We restrict customs as replicators to only those that involve normative propositions. In

239

other words, later recipients of a custom are expected to accept a coherent system of norms as earlier ones

240

did, rather than only a symbolic or ceremonial acknowledgement. By this standard of coherence, perhaps

241

the most important example of customs is religions, which are “a system of symbols which acts to […]

242

establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations” (73: 90), and coherently shape

243

behaviors of their members through “religiously determined systems of life-regulation” (74). A key

244

defining feature of religions is their consistent and fundamentalist doctrines, whether reinforced by

245

worship from cathedrals, pyramids, mosques, or temples such as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism,

246

Hinduism, and Judaism (75) or educated by morally prescriptive codes without a worship component

247

such as Jainism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and stoicism (76).
10

248

Writing systems Once created and adopted, a writing system remains highly resistant to changes.

249

As Coulmas (61: 11-14) summarized, writing systems serve important social functions such as “memory

250

supporting” (“mnemonic”), “expanding the communicative range” (“distancing”), “medium of

251

transmission [at a later time]” (“reifying”), and “regulating social conduct” (“social control”). These

252

social functions of writing form a well-accepted common knowledge of the rules in a society, which

253

reinforces standardization and inhibits copying errors. Re-educating people to accept new rules and

254

standards that diverge from the structures of an existing writing system becomes very costly.

255

Judicial systems Judicial systems around the world differ fundamentally in their adherence to the

256

principles of the rule of law. The rule of law can be said to exist only if historically a pre-existing body of

257

codified principles is sovereign over politically powerful people who make and change laws (39). Judicial

258

system principles (as opposed to specific laws and policies) are highly resistant to change, because of

259

their removal of the right of punishment and violence from unauthorized individuals (8). This legitimizes

260

the monopoly over these rights in a centralized system of specialized legal authority, that is, in the state or

261

independent juries empowered by the state (8, 77), whose coercive power is constitutionally protected

262

from challenges by any private citizens.

263

Scientific paradigms Paradigm shifts are rare events because they “must beat the rich-gets-richer

264

dynamics of already established ideas and scientists” (78). Students tend to accept scientific paradigms

265

“on the authority of teacher and text, not because of evidence” (64: 80). They seldom evoke

266

disagreements over fundamentals (64); and when they do, it is often easier for those who dissent in the

267

beginning of their academic career, when they start studying fundamentals, to move to another field or

268

area, whose paradigms are more consistent with their own beliefs.

269

Enduring Behavioral Predispositions

270

While societies increasingly interact with one another, due to the depth of the respective roots of

271

these environments in their underlying replicators, this does not necessarily lead to convergence, and

272

indeed might even result in resistance to alternative such structures and hence cause divergence. Viewed

273

in this way, human behaviors can be considered, at least partially, as a variety of sustained social
11

274

expressions, each such system being jointly predisposed by some separate and distinct set of the social

275

replicators shared at the community level. In what follows, we examine the enduring predispositions of

276

each replicator on modern-day human behaviors, which help explain resistance to institutional change and

277

hence the basis of continued diversity.

278

Pre-linguistic habitual predispositions Habits transmit information through vivid sensual

279

pathways, which enable people to read others’ emotional states (79). Some of the more sophisticated

280

habits such as gestures, body languages and facial expressions are shared across generations and form an

281

enduring cultural identity for a society. For instance, in contrast to what most people do in the world,

282

Bulgarians shake their heads to express affirmation and nod to mean negation (80). As another example,

283

Western Caucasians are found to express emotions predominantly through their eyebrows and mouth, but

284

East Asians do so more through eye movements and gaze direction (81, 82). Habits of thought that were

285

built up in early pre-linguistic communications during childhood shape how people see the world in

286

adulthood. Nisbett (83), for instance, attributes the cultural differences between Asians and Westerners

287

partially to their preverbal habits of thought. Specifically, Asian parents tend to use more verbs to

288

emphasize interactions when they speak to their preverbal children, whose habits of thought in turn tend

289

to start with contexts and relationships (83). Western parents, on the contrary, tend to use more nouns to

290

emphasize objectives, and therefore their children tend to have a habit of thought that considers individual

291

objectives as separate beings (83).

292

Grammatical linguistic predispositions The complexity and abstractness of grammatical

293

languages make it possible to form, store and transmit complicated information from an individual’s

294

mental model to a large group of people (8, 84-86). With grammatical rules and their associated mental

295

models, languages have an enduring influence on their speakers through shared semantic meanings and

296

perception framings that guide behaviors (84-88). Psycholinguists suggest that language is the primary

297

means by which we gain access to the contents of others’ minds and the medium by which subjects’

298

responses are elicited (89). For instance, Athanasopoulos, Bylund (90) and Choi and Bowerman (91)

299

found that bilinguals lexicalize motion events according to the grammatical constraints of the language in
12

300

which they operate. As another example, Chen (92) found that speakers of languages that grammatically

301

associate the future and the present are more likely to have future-oriented behaviors such as saving, non-

302

smoking, safer sex, and less obesity.

303

Customary predispositions

Customs such as ceremonies and communal gatherings

304

legitimize the recognition and acknowledgement of their underlying moral codes and norms (51), and so

305

serve to reinforce their persistence. Relatively institutionalized customs such as religions are sustained by

306

a system of specialized bureaucracies (e.g., the Catholic church), norms and rules (e.g., the use of bibles),

307

and international cooperation. Together, they teach followers certain moralities and beliefs, which in turn

308

constrain their behaviors. Max Weber (93), for example, famously attributed the emergence of capitalism

309

in Northern Europe to the Protestant work ethic. Studying Americans of different religions, Cohen and

310

Hill (94) found that Jews value community and biological descent but Protestants value personal beliefs.

311

Ferguson (95) argued that money lending (the precursor of modern banking) originated among Jews

312

because they could charge an interest, which Christians were forbidden to do. Islamic finance forbids

313

interest, gambling, and speculation – known as Riba, Qimar and Gharar - which are condemned in

314

several verses of the Al-Qur’an (96).

315

Writing predispositions Writing and literacy is a major facilitator of large-scale cooperative

316

behaviors by elaborating four cooperative tools of reciprocity, reputation formulation and maintenance,

317

social norms and norm enforcement, and group identity and empathy (97). Different writing systems

318

define differently the relationship between visual symbols and their underlying spoken languages, which

319

requires different cognitive and neural processing to store and communicate information (98-102). Such

320

differences in information processing and communications may affect how people behave in response to

321

visual information and stimuli (103). For instance, Tavassoli (104) found that surface features of a brand

322

such as colors had a stronger effect in logographs than in alphabets on consumers’ brand evaluation.

323

Judicial and legal predispositions

Judicial systems and laws form three facets of legal

324

environments: the facilitative environment that passively provides an arena for action; the regulatory

325

environment which seeks to regulate behaviors; and the constitutive environment that defines the basic
13

326

building blocks of acceptable behavior forms and social relations (105). The literature on how judicial

327

systems and laws shape behaviors has been well developed in the extensive discussions related to formal

328

rules in neo-institutional economics (3, 106) and regulatory pillars in neo-institutional theory (4) (for

329

reviews, see, e.g., 105, 107, 108). The former perspective portrays a human agent as rational wealth-

330

maximizers, who see the laws as a system of incentives and penalties (105). Whereas, the latter

331

perspective portrays humans as cultural rule-followers, who see laws as a system of moral principles,

332

scripted roles, and sacred symbols (105). There is a large literature on how families of legal systems

333

affect modern political and economic behaviors. For instance, legal origins have been found to be a

334

persistent determinant in investor protection (109), financial market regulations (110), regulation of entry,

335

regulation of labor, press government ownership, conscription, formalism check collection, tenure of

336

judges, and case law (77, 111).

337

Scientific paradigmatic predispositions Scientific paradigms provide algorithms, through which

338

educated people rationalize their theories and behaviors (112). A relevant example relates to how scholars

339

from different disciplinary backgrounds theorize about corporate governance relationships. Economists

340

tend to rely on agency theory, which assumes self-interest and moral hazard to analyze managerial

341

behaviors (113), whereas sociologists and psychologists tend to favor stewardship theory and depict

342

subordinates as “collectivists, pro-organizational, and trustworthy” (114: 20). Such behavioral effects are

343

also observed among practitioners. For instance, Fiss and Zajac (115) found that German CEOs with

344

economics or law degrees tended to be more oriented to move away from the stakeholder value tradition

345

into shareholder value maximization.

346

(RE)DRAWING THE BOUNDARIES OF SOCIETIES

347

Accepting that these social replicators are enduring behavioral predispositions, we may see

348

human behaviors to be not only genetically/ecologically but also socially predisposed by a complex field

349

of historically received replicators. Just like genetic transmission that forms biological family lineages,

350

transmission of social replicators forms social lineages based on the shared ancestors in each social

14

351

replicator. Thus, humans are not completely idiosyncratic individuals but predisposed into multiple levels

352

of societies, the boundary of each is defined by a shared lineage of replicators.

353

--------------------------------------

354

Insert Figure 1 about here

355

--------------------------------------

356

We therefore theorize about how each of the social replicators forms social lineages, which

357

distinguish between insiders and outsiders, through its social transmission, and thus draw the boundary of

358

societies. We argue that each replicator operates at a particular level of society, there being other levels

359

that are formed by other replicators, and these levels and their respective boundaries between insiders and

360

outsiders do not necessarily coincide. An insider at one level may be an outsider at another. We illustrate

361

the sequences and relations among these replicators and their transmission in Figure 1. A bubble shows

362

that each replicator on the X-axis corresponds to a different level of society on the Y-axis. In each bubble,

363

behaviors and social relations evolve as programmed by a distinct replicator, that when considered

364

together form multiple layers of a society. In addition to the effects of any specific replicator, at a

365

systemic level we may also identify a boundary of the common ecological conditions of a society that

366

constitute an overall selection environment.

367

Below we discuss how each replicator forms a unique path dependence through the social

368

transmission. Here, we follow the convention and define path dependence broadly as social processes,

369

through which the outcomes depend on a set of earlier programs (that is, the roots of replicators) (16).

370

Pre-linguistic Habit Transmission and Interpersonal Social Groups

371

Pre-linguistic habitual path dependence Habits diffuse through interpersonal interactions and

372

imitations, especially face-to-face communications (116). As such, although the diffusion of habits can be

373

wider than vertical biological families, it is limited to closely-knit social groups that share the same

374

repeating contexts and have effective personal communications among members (117). Hence, the

375

boundary of habits does not generally coincide with a national boundary or genetic lineages, but is more

376

likely to be limited to a social network in which members (regardless of nationality or biological
15

377

relatedness) have intensive interpersonal interactions. As one example, sports teammates practicing

378

together tend to share similar routines, which may differ drastically from people outside the team. Many

379

habits that are proven to enable effective communications may be later codified into other replicators (e.g.,

380

languages and customs), which enable wider social transmission (8, 118).

381

Interpersonal social outsidership

Similar to subjectively perceived barriers between

382

genetically defined populations, habits may also constitute social impediments between groups, due to our

383

inherent in-group biases (59, 119, 120). For instance, Hamlin, Mahajan (120) found that preverbal infants

384

prefer individuals who share the same food preferences over those who do not, and prefer individuals who

385

treat similar others well and dissimilar others poorly. As another example, it is also found that judging

386

emotional expressions among foreign cultural groups is more difficult (121).

387

Language Transmission and Ethnolinguistic Groups

388

Linguistic path dependence

Spoken languages can spread through sounds and voice

389

messages, so their capacity to replicate and establish social boundaries is not limited to sexual

390

transmission or face-to-face interactions. As Pinker (48: 8994) summarized, language “allows messages

391

to be composed out of elements, rather than drawn from a finite repertoire, it confers the ability to express

392

an unlimited number of novel messages”. In pre-history, languages diffused with human migration and

393

settlement (122). For instance, the Indo-European languages have been found to branch out with the

394

spread of agriculture from Anatolia round 7,800-9,800 years BC (123). Since grammatical languages can

395

be articulated as a system of rules, they can be taught by one person to a large group of students.

396

Ethnolinguistic groups emerge and expand as a result of linguistic diffusion. Ethnolinguistic boundaries

397

do not generally coincide with modern states, genetic lineages, or pre-linguistic habitual groups. For

398

instance, English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations, consisting of 52 member

399

states across the world, which were mostly territories of the former British Empire. In contrast, some

400

countries have multiple mutually unintelligible languages (or dialects) such as Spain, Switzerland, or

401

China.

16

402

Ethnolinguistic outsidership

Linguistic differences may form an enduring subjective barrier

403

due to miscommunications. For instance, Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín (124) find that ethnolinguistic diversity in

404

a linguistic tree is negatively related to public good provision and redistribution, and the effect is more

405

significant for divisions that arose in deep history thousands of years ago, more so than in recent such

406

separations. There are multiple facets of differences in the use of language that increasingly affect the

407

operations of global business today (125, 126).

408

Custom Transmission and Traditional Societies

409

Custom path dependence

Customs may diffuse over a wide range not limited by biological

410

families, face-to-face communications, or languages, largely because they facilitate the expansion of

411

cooperative and socially coherent groups and thus enable societies to expand beyond these previous social

412

boundaries (127). For instance, religions and their communal nature are found to have survival

413

advantages for large-scale societies, such as cooperative and altruistic relations that promote social

414

cohesion and economic prosperity (128-130). Shariff and Norenzayan (131) studied university students in

415

Canada and found that they allocated more money to anonymous strangers when concepts of God were

416

activated. Roes and Raymond (132) studied 186 societies and found that population size was positively

417

correlated with group sanctioned deities who are directly concerned with human morality. In addition to

418

communal activities, diffusion of customs has also been facilitated by missionaries and ambassadors

419

throughout history, sometimes accompanying trade and military expansion (133).

420

Traditional outsidership Differences between resistant traditions such as religions can be

421

substantial. As Varshney (134: 26) suggests, “conflicts concerning religious laws, places of worship, or

422

icons of special historic and cultural importance […] can be deadly”. The majority of literature in fact

423

evidences still widespread and persistent (de facto) religious segregation and conflicts in secular societies,

424

such as the Protestant-Catholic school segregation in Northern Ireland (135), Hindu-Muslim conflict in

425

India (134), Shia-Sunni violence in Pakistan (136), and the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments in the US and

426

Western Europe (137, 138). Studies also suggest that it is very difficult for different traditions and

427

religious beliefs to be assimilated into a shared common culture (139). Some major channels via which
17

428

different religious beliefs may be potentially assimilated are immigration, inter-religiously integrated

429

schools, and interfaith marriage (135, 140), with interfaith marriage argued to represent “the final

430

outcome of assimilation” (141: 408). However, empirical evidence suggests that such assimilation is more

431

symbolic than substantive. For instance, children of mixed religious marriages in the US are found to be

432

less committed to either religion than others whose parents believe in homogeneous religions (142, 143).

433

Writing System Transmission and Civilized Societies

434

Writing system path dependence Writing is considered by many historians to define the start of

435

human civilization (e.g., 54, 75, 144, 145). A community sharing a common writing system has therefore

436

often been termed a civilized society, in contrast to traditional societies, in which communications rely

437

primarily on interpersonal relationships, customs, and spoken languages. Since writing is associated with

438

its underlying spoken languages, writing lineages may largely overlap with linguistic lineages. However,

439

there are exceptions. For instance, both mainland Chinese and Taiwanese speak Mandarin, but they write

440

in simplified and traditional Chinese respectively, which can be substantially different (e.g., 一 vs. 壹,

441

pronouncing “/ē/” and meaning “one”), due to The Chinese Character Simplification Scheme promulgated

442

on the mainland in the 1950s. Another example is Urdu and Hindi in India, which share grammar and a

443

large part of their vocabularies, but base their writing on Arabic/Persian and Sanskrit roots respectively. A

444

third example is second generations of immigrants, who speak their parents’ languages but can only write

445

in alphabetical versions of these languages (e.g., Pinyin in Chinese).

446

Civilized outsidership

Writing systems may create communicative barriers, especially between

447

different types of language systems (e.g., the alphabetic vs. the logographic). One natural reason is that

448

reading in a new language requires a modified neural network from the old system (146). Such

449

modification can be very difficult for adults, because neural plasticity is at work only until around 10-12

450

years of age (102). Another reason is that written legal languages carry the function of social control in

451

the particular historical context of each society, which may not always have translatable equivalents in

18

452

another society (147). For instance, basic British legal terms such as “common law” or “equity” have no

453

equivalent in Islamic legal systems such as apply in Turkey (148).

454

Legal Transmission and Administrative Territories

455

Judicial system path dependence

A judicial system entails the codification of principles

456

into an impersonal authority (e.g., written records) and trains a group of legal specialists (e.g., lawyers,

457

judges, police, etc.) (8). These make it possible to teach and enforce laws over a large population under a

458

common coercive power (58). Historically, one pathway of judicial system diffusion has been the

459

colonization of states and legal transplantation through empires, such as the adoption of Romano-

460

Germanic civil law in continental European, Latin American, and some African and Asian nations, and

461

common law in the United Kingdom and its former colonies (77, 110, 149, 150). The second pathway for

462

diffusion of judicial systems has been the absorption of foreign judicial systems as a means of

463

modernization (very often, westernization) such as occurred in Japan in the Meiji Restoration (149). A

464

third pathway of diffusion is the reform of legal systems to bring them closer to the structure of Western

465

laws in many countries under the world order of “embedded liberalism” after World War II (WWII) (151:

466

379). In one version of this process, new member states reform their legal systems as a requirement for

467

joining regional trade blocs or economic cooperation agreements such as the European Union, the World

468

Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and

469

Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

470

Judicial and legal outsidership (or foreignness) In any of the above mechanisms for the spread

471

of legal approaches, by its very nature, the scope of judicial system diffusion is limited by the effective

472

reach of a jurisdiction’s coercive power. And for this reason, the boundary of a judicial system defines an

473

administrative territory such as a nation state, an autonomous region, an aboriginal territory, or an emirate.

474

Therefore, this is the one category of replicators, in which outsidership and foreignness may take on the

475

same meanings. Crossing the legal boundary of an administrative territory leads to differences in laws,

476

regulations, and policies, as well as their enforcement characteristics. However, different judicial laws

477

may be promulgated and enforced at different levels of government, suggesting that foreignness may refer
19

478

to outsidership from a nation, a state, a province, or a regional trade bloc, or some combination of them.

479

For instance, Beugelsdijk and Mudambi (152) suggest that international business activities are challenged

480

not only by national institutions but differences in various subnational rules and regulations. Institutional

481

theorist Ostrom (153) also suggests that the policies and regulations of a community derive from multiple

482

locations and levels of concurrent authorities.

483

Scientific Paradigm Transmission and Scientific Communities

484

Scientific paradigmatic path dependence

Scientific inquires and investigations are given

485

relative autonomy and academic freedom in universities and research organizations independent of any

486

authorities (154). Unlike judicial systems, the diffusion of scientific paradigms is not bounded by nation

487

states. In addition, their characterization by a high degree of articulation and codification (e.g., logical

488

terms and mathematical expressions) suggests that scientific paradigms are relatively less bounded by

489

linguistic or writing system differences, compared to more inarticulate or context-dependent knowledge

490

such as customs and laws. The diffusion of scientific paradigms is supported by various scientific

491

organizations and media, such as schools, universities, academic associations, joint research activities,

492

textbooks, and so on. Therefore, the scope of studentship, membership, and readership of these

493

organizations and media defines the boundary of a scientific paradigm.

494

Scientific paradigmatic outsidership

Artificial barriers to knowledge transfer are often created

495

by differences in methods and languages across knowledge areas and disciplines (155) as well as conflicts

496

in basic assumptions (156). Thus, it is not surprising that empirical findings suggest that scientific works

497

are mostly read and cited within their own discipline/field. For instance, a bibliometric analysis by Rinia,

498

van Leeuwen (157) showed that the majority of citations in basic sciences are within the same discipline,

499

such as physics (78.8%) and mathematics (72.9%). While we do see citations across disciplines, they

500

have to overcome various practical barriers such as years of advanced training (e.g., a Ph.D.), study

501

experiences (e.g., research, applications, and publications), as well as a sound understanding of basic

502

logics and assumptions (e.g., behavioral assumptions, teleology, etc.). Mapping the lineage of scientific

20

503

paradigms is complicated, as scholars have to probe deeply into a given discipline’s history of thought

504

(158).

505

IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN BEHAVIOR

506

Many theories in social sciences hold a provisional view of default human behavior or behavioral

507

assumptions of a human agent. Our review suggests that human behavior in an evolutionary sense may be

508

predisposed by a series of replicators at different levels of societies. While we do not deny individual

509

idiosyncrasies, our focus has been on group-level shared determinants of behavior. Thus, the default

510

behavior, defined as predisposed tendency of a typical human may quite legitimately differ depending

511

upon differences in the context of bio-ecological conditions, social replicators, and their interactions.

512

Social scientists often struggle to define uniform rational goals underlying human behavior (159-161). As

513

Simon (161) suggests, “the goal of an action is seldom unitary, but generally consists of a whole set of

514

constraints the action must satisfy”. In practice, researchers tend to choose (very often unconsciously) the

515

objective functions that are consistent with their discipline-based rationality rather than the ones that may

516

be most salient to the subjects they are trying to explain (7). This by itself is a disposition of scientific

517

paradigms.

518

We suggest rethinking such discipline-based rationality in favor of a more complex

519

socioecological system of naturally and socially structured rationalities. One difficulty is that the pursuit

520

of a single dominant goal cannot explain how diverse actions are predisposed to adapt to the underlying

521

bio-ecological roots and social replicators. Neither social conformity to external social environments nor

522

wealth maximization adequately capture a human group’s ultimate evolutionary goal, which is to sustain

523

reproduction of its replicators. For instance, communities of people not only follow their scientific

524

theories, obey local laws, respect local customs, but they are also primed with habits of thought

525

underlying their writing systems, grammars, and genetically influenced biases. To survive and thrive,

526

human groups need to continually experiment to find appropriate combinations of goals and learned

527

behaviors that come to work well in ways that may not have been readily predictable in advance, and

21

528

which vary across both time and space as their environments shift at the same time as they are changing

529

themselves.

530

Limitations

531

While we open up some potential new directions for theorizing about institutional diversity, we

532

also recognize some unresolved issues that need to be addressed in future extensions. The first is co-

533

evolution among replicators, especially their continued interaction and hence their interdependence. We

534

have discussed the seven categories of replicators following the evolutionary sequence in which they first

535

appeared (8), but the development of historically later replicators may likely cause renewed evolution in

536

earlier ones. For examples, laws are increasingly shaped by scientific evidence and theories; people of

537

similar scientific/disciplinary backgrounds are more likely to work together, reshaping habits. As we have

538

argued already, institutional systems are complex.

539

A second is potential influence of parent replicators from different lineages in the making of a

540

synthesized new lineage. Such influence can be asymmetric. For instance, while children inherit half of

541

genes from each parent, the genetically inheritable personality associated with one parent may be more

542

dominant. Also, languages and writing systems set different bars of literacy. For instance, compared to

543

alphabetical systems such as English, which is a linear combination of twenty-six letters, logographic

544

systems such as Chinese have a much higher bar of learning, for which thousands of complex characters

545

and their visuals need to be memorized before one can read (162). Therefore, it is likely more Chinese

546

forms are substituted by English than the other way around, when the two are synthesized into one system

547

(Chinglish).

548

A third is the technologies of new media, which may have fundamentally changed the ways in

549

which replicators are transmitted and synthesized across lineages. For instance, transmission of habits is

550

increasingly driven by social media (e.g., YouTube vines); language learning is more facilitated by online

551

tools; interdisciplinary knowledge integration is enabled by artificial intelligence (e.g., IBM Watson).

552
553

A fourth is a distinction between creative and evolutionary systems (16). Our current typology
focuses more on the evolutionary patterns, with limited discussions on the proactive design and
22

554

engineering of human agents. We see more and more entrepreneurial and purposive people in the re-

555

engineering at all seven levels of replicators and their transmission paths. Examples range from genetic

556

engineering of human cells (163) to the creation of new scientific paradigms through a peer-reviewed

557

journal process, just to name a few. We need to answer two questions. First, what are the effects of

558

purposes on the process of replicator diffusion and synthesis? Second, are, or how are, these purposes

559

predisposed by any replicators of the human agents who initiate an action?

560

Last, but not least, all replicators interact to impact human behaviors through their associated

561

information and stimuli on the human brain and the neural system. Understanding how they interact to

562

form perceptions and behaviors remains ambitious, without a better understanding of how all these sorts

563

of knowledge and information are stored and processed in human brains (11). We suggest social scientists

564

might have more meaningful collaborations with researchers in frontier disciplines such as neurosciences.

565

CONCLUSION

566

We have drawn on an evolutionary framework of bio-ecological conditions and social replicators to

567

review the literature on resistant roots of institutional diversity across societies. This review not only

568

helps us understand the resistant roots of institutions of a society, but also provides a suitable typology

569

through which to better understand the multifaceted character of societal boundaries, and the complex and

570

pluralistic goals underlying predisposed human behavior. We encourage additional conceptual and

571

empirical inquiry to help scholars further understand the diversity and complexity of all levels of

572

replicators, as well as to further investigate the processes through which these replicators influence and

573

co-influence human behaviors.

Legend: G=gene; P=prelinguistic habit; L=grammatic language; C=custom; W=writing system; J=Judicial system; S=Scientific paradigm;
E=Ecological conditions. The white bubbles (G and E) represent bio-ecological roots of institutions of a society, in the absence of social
replicators. Colored bubbles represent social replicators, sequentially emerged and evolved as resistant roots of institutions of a society.
Each bubble gives rise to a different level of society, based on shared social replicator lineages.
