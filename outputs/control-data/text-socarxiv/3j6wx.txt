Abstract
The cultural dynamics of music has recently become a popular avenue of research
in the field of cultural evolution, reflecting a growing interest in art and popular
culture more generally. Just as biologists seek to explain population-level trends
in genetic evolution in terms of micro-evolutionary processes such as selection,
drift and migration, cultural evolutionists have sought to explain population-level
cultural phenomena in terms of underlying social, psychological and demographic
factors. Primary amongst these factors are learning biases, describing how
cultural items are socially transmitted from person to person. As big datasets
become more openly available and workable, and statistical modelling techniques
become more powerful, efficient and user-friendly, describing population-level
dynamics in terms of simple, individual-level learning biases is becoming more
feasible. Here we test for the presence of learning biases in two large datasets of
popular song lyrics dating from 1965-2015 and 1965-2010, where we study the
trends in emotional expression. We find an overall increase in emotionally
negative lyrics and a decrease of positive ones. Our results provide some evidence
of content bias, prestige bias and success bias in the proliferation of negative
lyrics and decline of positive ones, and suggest that negative expression of
emotions in music, and perhaps art generally, provides an avenue for people to
not only process and express their own negative emotions, but also benefit from
the knowledge that prestigious others experience similarly negative emotions as
they do.

Introduction
Are the lyrics of contemporary pop songs happier or sadder than the lyrics of the
popular songs of previous generations? Do current songs talk about love more or less
than they used to? In recent years, the availability of large data sets in electronic
format has allowed such questions concerning long-term, population-level cultural
dynamics to be addressed in an increasingly precise, quantitative, way [1]. This, in
turn, permits researchers to test more general hypotheses about cultural trends and
changes that previously could only be assessed informally by focusing on a small
number of (potentially cherry-picked) cases.
A fruitful area of investigation concerns the analysis of emotions in human cultural
expressions. Several tools have been developed to extract the emotional content of
texts, also known as ‘sentiment analysis’. Some of these provide a classification of
how words score on ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ content [2], and others provide additional scores for specific emotions (e.g. how ‘angry’ or ‘sad’ is a text, [3]). In the
majority of cases, sentiment analysis has been applied on a short-term time scale,

Brand et al.

e.g. social media interactions [4]. However, some researchers have explored a longer
time scale, analysing the expression of emotions in several decades of song lyrics [5],
newspaper articles [6], in Grimm’s folktales [7], or in centuries of literary works [8].
The quantitative description of trends is fundamental, but a further necessary
step is to understand what drives these trends. Cultural evolution theory [9–11]
provides a series of concepts that allows such an endeavour. This research field
draws a parallel between genetic evolution and cultural change, arguing that the
latter can be seen as a Darwinian evolutionary process that shares fundamental similarities with, but also many differences to, genetic evolution. Inspired by biologists
who seek to explain large-scale, long-term patterns and trends in genetic evolution
in terms of individual-level processes such as selection, drift and migration, cultural evolutionists similarly seek to explain population-level patterns and trends in
cultural systems in terms of individual-level social, psychological and demographic
processes.
In particular, cultural evolutionists have focused on transmission or learning biases as key drivers of cultural evolutionary dynamics [12, 13]. Transmission biases
are individual-level heuristics that individuals use to decide what, when, and from
whom to copy. They are rule-of-thumb principles such as ‘copy the majority’, ‘copy
the successful’, or ‘copy the prestigious’ that allow individuals to adaptively learn
from others, on average [14]. Importantly, different transmission biases give rise to
different population-level cultural dynamics. A cultural trait introduced in a population in which, for example, individuals copy mostly from their parents will spread
slower than the same cultural trait introduced in a population in which individuals
copy mostly from a few successful or prestigious individuals [9].
‘Model-based’ biases describe from whom people learn: for example, a success bias
describes a tendency to learn from successful others, a prestige bias to learn from
prestigious (high status, respected) others. Other ‘content’ biases describe what kind
of information people learn best, due to its salience or memorability. For example,
a bias to transmit emotionally salient content, or negative content, has been found
in several lab experiments [15–18]. While there are many theoretical models that
explore the conditions under which different transmission biases are adaptive and
what their expected population-level consequences are [13] and experiments which
have tested the predictions of these models in controlled laboratory set-ups [19–
22], much less research has explored how cultural transmission biases may impact
real-life cultural dynamics (although see [23–25]).
In this paper, we test the extent to which transmission biases can explain trends
in the emotional content of two datasets of English language song lyrics. The first
dataset (‘billboard’) contains the lyrics of the songs included in the annual Billboard
Hot 100, a widely known US chart from 1965 to 2015 (N=4,913 songs). The second
dataset (‘mxm’) contains the lyrics of the English language songs present in the
musixmatch.com website, the world’s largest lyrics platform where users can search
and share lyrics, where we considered songs from 1965 to 2010 (N=159,293 songs).
Preliminary analyses found a substantial decrease in the use of positive emotions coupled with an increase in the use of negative emotion-related words in both
datasets. Specific emotion-related words show considerable change in use during the
time frame considered. For example, the use of the term ‘love’ more than halved in

Brand et al.

Page 3 of 14

both datasets, whereas ‘hate’ increased substantially (see Figure 1 for the billboard
dataset. The trends are qualitatively similar in the mxm dataset). These results are
broadly consistent with previous analyses of song lyrics [5, 26] and literary fiction
[27], pointing to the possible existence of a more general cultural or artistic trend
for increasingly negatively valenced emotional expressions.

Figure 1 ’Love’ and ‘hate’ through years in the Hot 100 Billboard. Proportion of the term ‘love’
and ‘hate’ with respect to the year words total, for all the songs in the billboard dataset.

The main goal of this paper is to test hypotheses about possible drivers of these
two trends. First, we checked whether linguistic effects could be causing the patterns. We considered a possible increase in slang words, an asymmetric semantic
change (for which words denoting negative emotions had acquired positive or neutral connotation), and a general increase in lyrics complexity (notice the latter
would predict that both negative- and positive-emotion words would decrease in
frequency). After finding that the trend persisted after controlling for these linguistic effects (see Supplementary Information), we then considered whether cultural
transmission biases might explain the pattern.
We consider, in a fully preregistered study, three hypotheses derived from cultural evolution theory as outlined above (see Methods section for how these verbal
hypotheses were statistically implemented in our dataset):
• (H1) Success bias: the emotional trends result from artists copying the best
selling songs from the preceding years.
• (H2) Prestige bias: the emotional trends result from artists copying the songs
of ‘prestigious’ artists (independently from the success of the songs) from the
preceding years.
• (H3) Content bias: there is a general human preference for lyrics that reflect
negative emotions in songs, thus songs with more negative content rank higher
in the charts.
Notice we applied H1 and H2 both to positive and negative content, while H3 is
applied only to negative content, as we do not have predictions regarding content
preferences towards positive emotions.
As our models are multi-level in nature, these hypotheses propose that the effects
of success/prestige/content will be apparent whilst controlling for variation within
artists, genre, and year of release.

Our results are mixed, in that we found a small effect of success bias on the
likelihood of a word being positive in the billboard dataset, as well as a small effect
of both prestige and content bias on the likelihood of a word being negative in the
billboard dataset. However, these effects vastly reduced or became non-existent in
the mxm dataset. We conclude that all three biases may play a small role in the
likelihood of using positive or negative emotion words in song lyrics, but that these
effects may be too small to be detected in big data, or may be swamped by other
extraneous variables. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies between
the billboard and mxm datasets, as well as our interpretation and implementation
of success, prestige, and content biases in relation to the content of song lyrics.

Methods
Data preparation
‘mxm’ dataset
We downloaded (in August 2017) the full dataset (N=237,662 songs) from the
musiXmatch dataset [28]. This dataset provides lyrics in bag-of-words form: each
song is described as the word-counts for the top 5,000 words across the set. Rare
terms are thus not recorded, but this does not affect our analysis, because all the
emotion-words in the lists we used (see below) were among the top 5,000 We used
the mxm track ID to retrieve from musixmatch.com the name of the artist(s), the
year of first release, and the genre, for each track, and we integrate the information
in the main dataset.
From the full dataset we eliminated songs for which it was not possible to retrieve
the year or the artist, as well as songs that did not appear to be in English. To assess
if a song was in English we simply checked whether the word ‘the’ was present at
least once. We kept years for which at least 500 songs were included, therefore
excluding songs published before 1965 or after 2010 (we kept the year 1970, even
though the dataset contained 278 songs so as to retain a dataset with consecutive
years). The new dataset comprised N=159,293 songs.
Artists’ names were further processed using the cluster function in the refinr
package in R [29] to cluster and merge similar names (e.g. ‘madonna’, ‘Madonna’,
‘MADONNA’). To disambiguate collaborations we looked for standard separators in
artist names (‘featuring’, ‘feat.’, ‘feat, ‘and’, ‘AND’ ,‘&’, ‘with’, ‘,’). We considered
artists where no separators were found as single artists. We then ran the strings
where separators were found (e.g. X and Y) through the list of single artists. If
both X and Y were found in this list, then X and Y were considered as single artists
occasionally collaborating (e.g. Eminem and Dr. Dre), and the song represented
two (or more, if a collaboration of more artists) data points in our final analysis.
If not, they were considered a stable collaboration(e.g. Simon and Garfunkel) or a
band (e.g. The Mamas & the Papas) and a single data point in our models. The
final dataset had thus N=161,587 data points.
‘billboard’ dataset
We downloaded (in May 2017) the data from the GitHub repository ‘walkerkq/musiclyrics’ [30]. This dataset provides the full lyrics for songs in the yearly
Billboard Hot 100 chart, with few missing (N=4,913 songs). Since the lyrics in the

Brand et al.

Page 5 of 14

mxm dataset are stemmed (a common practice in digital text analysis: words are
reduced to their stems, roughly analogous to their morphological roots, e.g. ‘happily’, ‘happy’, and ‘happiness’ are all reduced to the stemmed form: ‘happi’), we
processed the billboard dataset in the same way, readapting the script used to process the mxm dataset, available in the author’s GitHub repository [31] When, in
what follows, we use ‘word’ or ‘lyric’ we are referring to the stemmed version. For
consistency with the mxm dataset, we also discarded words that were not included
in the list of the top 5,000 words described above.
Artists were further processed in the same way as the mxm dataset. Notice the
‘genre’ entry is not present in this dataset, as this information was not provided
but, importantly, chart position is, which we coded as ‘rank’. Rank is the song’s
chart position, from 1 to 100, in the yearly Billboard chart, where 1 indicates the
best-selling and 100 indicates the least-selling song. The final dataset had N=5,878
data points.
Sentiment analysis tool
We used the ‘positive emotions’ and ‘negative emotions’ categories of the text analysis application Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [3]. These categories are ‘virtually unchanged’ compared to the most recent (2015) version of LIWC (Pennebaker,
pers. comm.). The words were stemmed as described above, and we analysed the
lyrics with N=267 negative emotion stems and N=198 positive emotion stems. Thus
each word of each song was classified as either positive, negative or neither.
Data analysis
We used Bayesian, aggregated binomial, multilevel models, to examine the effect of
prestige, success and content bias on the likelihood of any given word being either
positive or not, and negative or not. We used the Rethinking package in R [32] . We
compared WAICs in a model comparison approach, but interpreted the parameter
estimates of the full models in all cases. Model parameters were said to have an effect
on the model outcome if their 89% credible interval did not cross zero. Priors were
chosen to be weakly regularising, in order to control for both under and overfitting
the model to the data. Due to the large number of data points that each model
processed (each model of the mxm dataset processed roughly 29 million words), we
had to implement a range of priors and adapt the models accordingly to ensure
sufficient and appropriate mixing. Trace plots and effective sample sizes were used
to check for appropriate model convergence throughout.
Full analysis scripts and data are available in the GitHub repository ‘lottybrand22/song lyrics’ [33], and were preregistered through the Open Science Framework [34].
Levels of analysis
Each word of a song was coded, according to LIWC, as ‘positive’ (when present in
the list of positive stems), ‘negative’ (when present in the list of negative stems)
or neither. Thus, we implemented separate models for coding positive and negative
lyrics (see Tables 1 and 2). Our models are aggregated binomial models, in that
the words are aggregated within songs, but each word of a song is modelled as

Brand et al.

Page 6 of 14

the binomial probability of being positive (or not). The negative models model the
likelihood that each word in a song is negative (or not). This takes into account
the fact that each song has a different number of words, and negates any need for
averaging over words and songs. Each song is not an independent data point, as
the data are clustered on artists, genre, and year of release. Thus, we implemented
varying effects models, allowing adaptively regularising priors for the intercepts of
artist, genre and year of release.
Our hypotheses
The success bias models assume that the probability that any given word in a song
is positive (or negative) can be predicted by the average number of positive (or
negative) words of the top ten songs in the preceding three years of the billboard
list. Thus our variable ‘success’ for both mxm and billboard datasets, consisted of
the average number of positive (or negative) words from the top ten songs of the
billboard dataset (for the preceding three years of the song of interest).
The prestige bias models assume that the probability that any given word in a
song is positive (or negative) can be predicted by the average number of positive
(or negative) words of the prestigious artists in the preceding three years. We define
prestigious artists as those that appeared more than 10 times in the Billboard Hot
100. This results in 86 ‘prestigious’ artists (less than 4% of the total in the billboard
dataset).
The content bias models assume that the probability that a word of a song will be
negative is predicted by the rank of the song in the Billboard charts (see Tables 1
and 2 for specifications of all models in the two datasets).

Results
Model comparison
Our model comparison results suggested that, although some models hold the majority of the weight, their WAIC values are not very different from one another, and
the standard errors of the differences show that there is a lot of uncertainty in the
model comparison. Furthermore, we are aware that model comparison is less robust
when modelling time-series data (McElreath, pers. comm.). Thus, we are reporting
the results of the full models that include all of the effects of interest, while noting
that the model comparison results should be interpreted with caution.
Models of positive lyrics using the billboard dataset
When modelling the likelihood that any word in the lyrics of a song is positive, the
full model suggested that success had a positive effect (mean coefficient estimate:
0.04, 89% confidence interval: [0.00, 0.07], however prestige did not have a strong
effect (0.02, CI:[-0.01,0.06]), see Figure 2

Estimates include 89% confidence intervals. Estimates that cross zero are interpreted as not

These effects are on the log-odds scale, and thus can be interpreted as the odds
that a given word is positive increases by 4% as the number of positive words in
the previous three years of top ten hits increases. The model comparison suggests
support for H1, suggesting that our hypothesis that success-bias contributes to
the proportion of positive lyrics was best supported, although there is a lot of
uncertainty around the models’ WAIC estimates.
Models of negative lyrics using the billboard dataset
When modelling the likelihood that any word in the lyrics of a song is negative, the
full model suggested that prestige had a positive effect (mean coefficient estimate:
0.08, 89% CI: [0.01, 0.14], however success did not have a strong effect (0.01, CI:[0.05,0.07]). Chart position had a negative effect, meaning songs that had a better
chart position (e.g. closer to 1 rather than 100) increased the log odds of a lyric
being negative (-0.02, CI:[-0.04,-0.01]), see Figure 3. The model prediction of the

Brand et al.

effect of prestige on the proportion of negative lyrics is shown in Figure 4. The model
comparison suggested the best model was the full model, suggesting that prestige
bias and content bias play a role in the proportion of negative lyrics, although there
is a lot of uncertainty around the models’ WAIC estimates.

suggested the best model was the null model, suggesting that our parameters for
success and prestige did not improve the model fit more than simply including the
varying effects for artist, genre and year of release.

Models of negative lyrics using the mxm dataset
When modelling the likelihood that any word in the lyrics of a song be negative,
the full model suggested that neither prestige nor success had an effect (prestige:
0.00, 89% CI: [-0.02, 0.01], success: 0.00, CI:[-0.01,0.01]), see Figure 6. Furthermore,
the model comparison suggested the best model was the null model, suggesting that
our parameters for success and prestige did not improve the model fit more than
simply including the varying effects for year, artist, genre.

Discussion
We analysed the emotional content of song lyrics in around 165,000 songs spanning
the years 1965-2015. We found that the frequency of negative words increased over
time, whilst the frequency of positive words decreased over time, and asked whether
these patterns could be attributed to cultural transmission biases, specifically success bias, prestige bias, and content bias. In the billboard dataset, containing top-100
songs from 1965 to 2015, we found small but measurable effects of success on positive lyrics, with the odds of any given word in a song being positive increasing by
4% when the previous three years of top ten hits contained more positive lyrics. For
negative lyrics, we found small but measurable effects of artist prestige (the odds of
any given word being negative increased with the number of negative words used by
best-selling artists in the previous three years) and a negativity content bias (chart
position was predicted by negative content). In the larger mxm dataset we found a
weak effect of prestige for positive lyrics, and no effects for negative lyrics.
The effects of these biases are extremely small, which can partly be attributed to
the fact that we analysed the data on the scale of each word, negating any need

for averaging over lyrics and songs. Thus, the relative increase or decrease in the
log odds are understandably small. These effects were uncovered despite a coarse
and simplified implementation of success, prestige and content biases. It is therefore
unsurprising that the effects vastly reduced or disappeared in the much larger mxm
dataset given how many other factors must be at play in the generation of song
lyrics, both directional biases such as those we explored here, and random chance
[35]. For example, prestige can be realised in a myriad of ways, particularly in
the music industry. The effect of various recording companies, the extent of media
attention outside of the charts, the amount of money spent on music promotion,
may all play a significant role, demonstrating that our implementation of ‘prestige’
only captures one small aspect of musical prestige.
The effect of prestige bias was stronger than the effect of success bias in two of the
full models. This goes against theoretical predictions that, when success information
is available, individuals should use success bias as it is a more direct and valid cue
of social information compared to prestige information, which is usually an indirect
measure, or secondary cue, of success [36]. This may reflect an over reliance on
prestige bias in the domain of music, as artists often gain prestige which is inflated
compared to their relative record sales or chart success. Moreover, prestige in the
domain of music may be an example of ‘runaway selection’ in which an artist who
is successful at one point in time, may then gain prestige due to their popularity
and number of fans, leading to increased prestige over time which is decoupled from
their musical expertise or success at a later point in time. It is worth noting that
our implementation of prestige is a measure of an artists’ overrepresentation in the
charts compared to other artists in the charts. Thus, although our measure of prestige is separate from our measure of success in that an artist may be overrepresented
in the charts overall, but not currently in the charts at a particular point in time,
the measure may be more directly related to success than other implementations
of prestige. Furthermore, in one of the full models, success bias was indeed a better
predictor of positive lyrics than prestige bias.

Brand et al.

The presence of a content bias in the likelihood of negative lyrics occurring in the
billboard songs is noteworthy. This result suggests that songs with more negative
lyrics are more successful in general, perhaps either reflecting a general negativity
bias [15, 17], or an art-specific, or music-specific, negativity bias. Similar trends
favouring negative emotions versus positive ones in other artistic domains support
our finding. As mentioned, Dodds and Danforth [5] already documented an increase
in frequency of positively-valenced words, and a decrease in negatively-valenced
ones in pop song lyrics (a similar result is found in [26]). Morin and Acerbi [27]
found a parallel effect in centuries of literary fiction, with a general decrease in the
frequency of words denoting emotions, explained by a decrease in words denoting
positive emotions, whereas the frequency of negative words remains constant. It is
worth noting that we were unable to look for content bias (with our implementation)
in the mxm data as there was no ranking system for the mxm data. One possible
way of determining the popularity or use of a song could be to look at how many
times, or how often, its lyrics are searched for, and whether this correlates with
negative content.
In general, the idea that negative emotions would be privileged in art is consistent with the hypothesis that artistic expressions may have an adaptive function,
in particular as simulation of social interactions [37]. According to this view, developed with literary fiction in mind but potentially generalisable to other expressive
forms, art would provide hypothetical scenarios where we can test and train, with no
risk, our cognitive and emotional reactions. In this perspective, simulating negative
events is more useful than simulating positive ones [38, 39]. Art expressing negative
emotions, in addition, may hold more value for audiences looking to seek comfort
from the knowledge that others also experience negative emotions. Indeed studies
have shown that people tend to underestimate the prevalence of others’ negative
emotions, and this underestimation exacerbates loneliness and decreases life satisfaction [40]. Furthermore, suppressing rather than reappraising negative emotions
decreases self-esteem and increases sadness [41]. Taken together, the presence of
prestige, success, and negativity biases may reflect a process by which people are
generally comforted by others’ negative emotional expression, and are particularly
comforted when that person is prestigious or familiar. This hypothesis is worth
investigating in future research.
Our varying effects models suggested that most of the variation lay between
artists, however genre showed considerable variation too. We were unable to control for genre in the billboard data as genre information was not available with
this dataset. This could provide a partial explanation for our differing results between the billboard and mxm datasets; indeed, Dodds and Danforth [5] attributed
the decrease in emotional valence within pop song lyrics to the emergence of more
negative genres such as heavy metal and punk. Future work investigating the variation of emotional expression between different genres of music would be valuable.
A further limitation of this study is that we limited our analysis to comparing the
content of each song with that of the songs from the previous three years’ of songs.
Mechanistically this suggests that songs that are currently in the charts influence
song-writers who are writing within three years of chart success, assuming the time
it takes to get from the song-writing process to chart success is three years or less.

Future work could test whether these effects are stronger or weaker at different
time points, such as within 1 or 5 years of chart success. Furthermore, although
we controlled for artist, many songs in the billboard charts are in fact written by
specially designated song-writers, such as Max Martin. Investigating the effect of
song-writer on the emotional expression within songs would be a fruitful avenue for
future research.
Given the robustness of the trends and the relative weakness of the effects we
found, as well as their inconsistency, this research points to the possibility that other
factors are needed to explain the trends. It is possible to speculate, for example,
that as standards of living increase, people get more cooperative and more trustful
[42]. This, in turn, allows the expression of more sincere feelings in art, including
more negative emotions. Commercial interest may also have played a role. Media
and producers could have artificially inflated the presence and the success of songs
with positive emotions in the early years of commercial diffusion of popular music,
so that the trend we observe could be simply interpreted as a regression to the mean
after an exaggerated positive peak in the 50s of last century, as Morin and Acerbi
[27] mention for literary fiction and the possibility of an ‘emotional peak’ in the
Romantic era.
Overall this research contributes to the growing body of work attempting to quantitatively study trends in the domain of music. Our starting result of an increase in
negative emotions and decrease in positive ones in song lyrics is paired by similar
findings regarding acoustic qualities. Using the same Billboard Hot 100 songs that
we analysed, Schellenberg and von Scheve [43] found an increase in minor mode
and a decrease in the average tempo, which indicate that the songs become more
sad-sounding through time. This seems to be part of a longer trend in western classical music, where the use of the minor mode had increased in a 150-year period
from 1750 to 1900 [44]. The relationship between minor tone and negative valence of
lyrics has been also studied, and confirmed, quantitatively [45]. Analogously, studying more than 500,000 songs released in UK between 1985 and 2015, Interiano et al.
[46] found a similar decrease in ‘happiness’ and ‘brightness’, coupled with a slight
increase in ‘sadness’ (these high-level features result from algorithms analysing lowlevel acoustic features, such as the tempo, the tonality, etc.). They also found the
puzzling result that, despite a general trend towards sadder songs, the successful
hits are, on average, happier than the rest of the songs. In the same way, whereas
we found that the higher the position in the billboard chart the more negative a
song is, billboard songs are as a whole more positive than the songs in the mxm
dataset, which contains more (and less successful) songs.
More specifically, in our research we apply cultural evolutionary theory to understand these trends [47–50]. It holds value in contributing to the growing body of
work demonstrating the precision with which one can model large datasets, revealing
evidence of underlying behaviour at the individual level. Not only does research of
this nature help to integrate cultural evolution theory with the arts and humanities,
but also contributes to our understanding of how culture influences the expression
of emotions [51] Exploring the cultural evolution of music is becoming a valuable
and rich area of research for revealing the cultural transmission mechanisms that
can underpin some of the most pervasive of human cultural practices such as music
production.
