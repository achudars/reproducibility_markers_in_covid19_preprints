Economic Populism and Bandwagon Bigotry:
Obama-to-Trump Voters and the Cross Pressures of the 2016 Election
Abstract

Through an analysis of validated voters in the 2016 American National Election Study,
this article considers the voters who supported Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. More than
5.7 million in total, Obama-to-Trump voters were essential to Trump’s victory in the Electoral
College. They were more likely to be white, working class, and resident in the Midwest. They
had lower levels of political interest, were centrist in both party affiliation and ideology, and
were late deciders for the 2016 election. On economic interests, they were centrists, except for
trade policy, which they viewed, on average, as a greater threat than other voters. They claimed
to have more experience with economic vulnerability than Democratic loyalists of comparable
social standing. On racial attitudes, including the racialized economic topic of immigration,
they had a profile similar to Republican loyalists. While their support of Trump may be
attributable to surging white nativism, this article argues for an alternative explanation. Voters
who were attracted by Trump’s economic populism only joined his coalition if they could
accept his racialized rhetoric. As a result, the Trump bandwagon predominantly attracted
generically bigoted voters with racial attitudes similar to Republican loyalists.

Introduction
When investigating the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, many quantitative social
scientists have asked causes-of-effects questions: What configuration of causes mattered, and
which component causes mattered the most? Guided by this logic of analysis, researchers have
debated the relative importance of economic interests, racial prejudice, white nativism, and
ethno-nationalism, often using vote-choice regression models for the full electorate that estimate
net associations simultaneously for measures of each of these causes.
While important for our public understanding of US politics, these studies are also
important for the scholarly literature itself, which, in the main, did not suggest Trump would
win by defeating establishment Republicans in the primaries and then by flipping battleground
states in the Midwest in the general election. Understanding the causes of an unanticipated
event is, therefore, an important goal for scholarly research, and a causes-of-effects strategy is
one approach that can be taken.
Consider the following prominent attempt, which, if media coverage is an indication, is
likely to become one of the most widely cited analyses of this type. In their book Identity Crisis:
The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America, Sides, Tesler, and
Vavreck (2018) present regression results that the net association between racial attitudes and
voting Republican increased between 2012 and 2016. In contrast, the net association between
economic interests and voting Republican did not change much at all (see their Tables A8.4 and
A8.5). Incorporating a few more claims about religion and immigration based on their models,
they concluded that

1

… the origins of Trump’s unique appeal in the general election were similar to the origins of his
appeal in the primary: in both cases, his candidacy helped to make identity-inflected issues
central to voters’ choices. And it was these issues that largely explained the most notable
demographic divide in the electorate: between voters with more or less formal education.
The activation of these issues helped Trump win because there were so many Obama
voters whose views on these issues were arguably closer to Trump’s than to Obama’s or Clinton’s
– and these voters were especially prevalent in battleground states. Their shift to Trump helped
him prevail in the Electoral College, even while losing the popular vote. (Sides et al. 2018: 178-79)

According to most arguments like this one, the activation of identity, especially racial identity,
is the primary mechanism that delivered the victory to Trump in the general election. This
activation attracted additional white voters, disproportionately from the working class, into
Trump’s winning coalition.
How convincing is identity activation as the key explanation? Whether Trump spoke
about identity-relevant issues during his campaign is not under serious debate. He certainly
did, and he has doubled down on the same strategy of rhetorical provocation multiple times
since taking office. The core question that remains under debate is whether or not the shift of
many white, working-class voters from support for Obama in 2012 to support for Trump in
2016 can be “largely explained” by identity activation in voters themselves. As we discuss
below, the primary alternative position is that Trump’s consistent campaign theme of
renegotiating trade deals with China and Mexico, in order to “bring back jobs,” was especially
appealing to voters in Midwestern battleground states, and that its appeal was reinforced by his
separate commitment to reduce competition for working class jobs and wages by restricting
immigration.
To assess the evidence for these positions, while complementing the relative-importance
regression models of others, in this article we analyze shifting electoral coalitions directly. We
return to the earliest sociological tradition of voting analysis, analyzing cross pressures like

2

those that Lazarsfeld and his colleagues considered in their work on elections in the 1940s.
Although we consider the full electorate at the beginning of our analysis, we then narrow our
focus to non-Hispanic whites who voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016, with
secondary consideration of non-Hispanic whites who did not vote in 2012, even though eligible,
but then voted for Trump in 2016. These are the two largest groups to join the coalition of
Trump voters, after declining to vote for Romney in 2012, and they include individuals with the
racial self-identification that makes them susceptible to identity motivations of the sort that
Trump is said to have activated.
In the next section, we detail our theoretical orientation by taking positions on the
relevance for our analysis of several voting concepts from the sociological literature. We then
summarize the current state of the debate on the 2016 election, beyond the prominent piece by
Sides et al. (2018) discussed above. In so doing, we also lay the groundwork for the subsequent
empirical analysis that will inform our core research question: How did Trump build his
winning coalition of voters? We offer an answer to this question in our discussion section,
contrasting two narratives for why his coalition of voters secured the Electoral College victory
that eluded Romney: (1) surging white nativism and (2) economic populism with bandwagon
bigotry. The evidence more strongly supports to the latter, as we will explain below.

Back to Basics: Lazarsfeld and Cross-Pressured Voters
The concept of “cross pressures” is most commonly attributed to the 1944 book The People’s
Choice by Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet (see also Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954). In
their analysis of the 1940 election, Lazarsfeld and his colleagues identified two classic cross-

3

pressured groups – working-class protestants and affluent Catholics – whose apparent loyalties
to class and religion did not promote consistent and “natural” support for either Republican or
Democratic candidates. For their study, they utilized a monthly panel survey – the first of its
kind – to examine how respondents’ intended votes changed as candidates were nominated in
contested party conventions, campaigns were then conducted, and final votes were cast.
Lazarsfeld and his colleagues introduced cross pressures as a general interpretive tool
for empirical analysis, especially appropriate for understanding the late decisions that can be
crucial for election outcomes. They introduced the concept in this passage:
… those who made their choice in the late days of the campaign were people subject to
more cross-pressures. By “cross-pressures” we mean the conflicts and inconsistencies
among the factors which influence vote decision. Some of these factors in the
environment of the voter may influence him towards the Republicans while others may
operate in favor of the Democrats. In other words, cross-pressures upon the voter drive
him in opposite directions. (Lazarsfeld et al. 1944:53; emphasis in the original)

The guiding result for the 1940 election, which was further bolstered by a subsequent analysis
of the 1948 election, was their empirical demonstration of how cross pressures created
uncertainty and indecision that had to be resolved in order to decide how to vote. In their
analyses, cross-pressured voters often failed to pass the “acid test” of actually turning up to
vote. And, when they did vote, they often decided on their preferred candidate only shortly
before the election.
With this conceptualization, cross pressures are not simply conflicting attitudes and
identities that are relevant to political matters in general. Cross pressures are the specific
positions in the stratification order, interactional patterns in primary and secondary groups, and
issue preferences that generate uncertainty and indecision as individuals deliberate on future
vote choices. In the aggregate, it is the resolution of these cross pressures that determines
4

electoral outcomes in close contests, with variation across elections shaped by social change at
the individual level and political change at the party and candidate level. Lazarsfeld and his
colleagues saw the study of how cross pressures are resolved to be a major topic of study in
voting research, and they identified the potential mechanistic importance of media sources,
campaign propaganda, and social influence in structuring final voting decisions.
Political scientists continue to use the language of cross pressures in electoral studies,
although often only as interpretive language for characterizing putative swing voters.1 In
sociology, however, the concept of a “cleavage,” as initially elaborated at length by Lipset, has
received much more attention in contemporary political sociology (see Lipset 1960 and Lipset
and Rokkan 1967, Ch. 4).2 Cleavages are features of social structure that shape both party
strategy and the political predispositions of voters.3 In typical usage, the cleavage concept is
deployed to demarcate persistent political conflict across recognized social divisions that
generate alternative political interests. When voters have interests that arise from cross-cutting
cleavages, opportunities emerge for parties, as well as entrepreneurial candidates, to assemble
new voting coalitions. In this way, a dynamic relationship can emerge between voter
preferences and party appeals, with election outcomes determining whether new coalitions

1

For example, Sides et al. (2018) use the language of cross pressures in this way. For a more general discussion, and
other examples, see Brader, Tucker, and Therriault (2014).
2

Lipset studied with Lazarsfeld and drew on the concept of cross pressures when developing early versions of
cleavage theory. Likewise, cleavages are present as a secondary analytic distinction in Berelson et al. (1954).
Lazarsfeld later indicated that he left voting research after the 1950s because he was interested in how decisions were
made, while most sociologists were not. As he recounted in Lazarsfeld and Stehr (1982:152), his work on voting was
marked by “a strong concentration on decision processes,” asking “how did [people] decide how to vote.” This focus
became a “homeless skill or art” because “it was too individual for sociologists, and too introspective for academic
psychologists” (the latter of whom had become “strongly behaviorist-oriented”).

Manza and Brooks (1999) provide a full explanation of variants of cleavage theory in the literature.

arise. Emergent coalitions that persist across multiple elections can then alter the understood
mapping of cleavages to parties.
For the 2016 election, cross pressures were present – as we will show below – and these
could be considered to arise from cross-cutting cleavages in social structure. From this
perspective, the current debate over the party loyalty of the white working class can be
interpreted as a debate over the primacy of the race and class identities that are legacies of
twentieth-century cleavages. This is a reasonable position, but we embrace the concept of cross
pressures instead. It directs attention to the uncertainty and indecision that operate at the
individual level, where vote decisions are enacted, rather than the plate tectonics of Lipset’s
macrosociology. It is also too early, and the 2016 election too unusual, to evaluate the strong
narrative that a crystallized race cleavage has trumped an eroding class cleavage in US politics.
Finally, because our inspiration is Lazarsfeld’s original conception of cross pressures,
which must be factors that influence a particular vote decision, we depart modestly from one
notable and interesting usage of “cross pressures” in the recent sociological literature.
Baldassarri and Goldberg (2014) consider the relationships among forty attitudes that were
measured at least three times between 1984 and 2004 among voters and eligible non-voters in
eight iterations of the American National Elections Studies (ANES). They offer a cluster
analysis that classifies the eligible electorate in each year into three groups of individuals –
ideologues, alternatives, and agnostics – who, they argue, adhere to alternative political belief
systems. For their yearly model solutions, the “alternatives” have aggregate attitudinal patterns
that Baldassarri and Goldberg conclude are consistent with the existence of cross pressures in

6

the electorate as a whole, with the archetype being those who are morally conservative but
economically liberal.
In their analysis, Baldassarri and Goldberg make no reference to the Lazarsfeldian
tradition of modeling actual vote choices by analyzing cross pressures, with the uncertainty and
indecision that they create. Instead, they attempt to unravel patterns of political polarization
between 1984 and 2004 by using covariation from their attitudinal measures twice: first to
partition the electorate by a measure of relationality and then to examine between-individual
patterns within the identified clusters. In so doing, they argue that in order to understand
trends in US politics, “it is necessary to consider citizens’ political preferences as making up an
interdependent gestalt rather than a collection of independent attitudinal vectors” (Baldassarri
and Goldberg 2014:53).4
Our goal for analysis is much different. We do not aim to classify individuals based on
relational configurations of attitudes, nor identify component belief systems based on whether a
cluster of individuals can be identified that does not easily map on to a political party. We take
it for granted, based on decades of distinguished work by others, that attitude and interest
conflict is pervasive and, furthermore, that complex configurations of attitudes and interests are
endemic to diverse modern political cultures that are constrained by electoral rules that
reinforce two-party dominance.

4

Although focused on the political science concept of a political belief system, their analysis builds most directly on
sociological studies of social change and polarization that do not consider electoral behavior at all (e.g., DiMaggio,
Evans, and Bryson 1996; Evans 2003). This is presumably why Baldassarri and Goldberg do not consider particular
elections and the votes that determined them. They also do not use many years of the ANES data, including data
available for 2008 and 2012, which makes it difficult to connect their interpretations to voting patterns from the
Obama-era onward.

7

Instead, we aim to participate in the construction of a plausible explanation for a
particularly vexing recent election, and we maintain that modeling how voters appear to have
resolved their cross pressures is vital for building a specific explanation that can achieve a
scholarly consensus. The clusters of the electorate for our analysis, like for Lazarsfeld, are the
actual voting patterns that suggest how cross pressures were resolved. These are the patterns
that are most relevant for generating an explanation of a specific election outcome. In
particular, we will show that much can be learned about the 2016 election by considering how
Obama-to-Trump voters were cross pressured for the 2016 election, and why their switch from
the 2012 Democratic nominee to the 2016 Republican nominee must be part of any convincing
explanation for the 2016 outcome.

Competing Explanations for the 2016 Election Outcome
Although estimates vary, Obama-to-Trump voters represented between 9 and 14 percent of
Trump’s 62.9 million general election voters, and they were disproportionately prevalent
among members of the white working class (see, e.g., Morgan and Lee 2018, Table 1 and Table
S2, as well as the online supplement to this article). Partisanship remained strong in 2016, and
most stalwart Republican voters were insufficiently attracted by Clinton’s campaign to break
with their party’s nominated candidate. Some Republican loyalists embraced Trump, and some
merely accepted him, but rather few defected based on either the substance or style of Trump’s
appeal. Had enough of them done so, Obama-to-Trump voters would not have mattered much
for the outcome, even though they could still have been of analytic interest. Instead, Obama-toTrump voters proved crucial for the outcome because they expanded the reliably Republican

8

electorate by a sufficient amount to more than make up for the defection of Romney-to-Clinton
voters (see Tables S1 and S2 in the online supplement for a comparison). With the support of
Obama-to-Trump voters, numbering at least 5.7 million, Trump secured a narrow victory in the
Electoral College.
As debates over the election outcome have unfolded, many topics remain on the table
for consideration. An important one is how best to characterize the decisions made by Obamato-Trump voters. At this point, on this question, a full distribution of conclusions can be found
in the literature, based on the relative weighting of economic interests and some version of racebased group identity.
At one end of the distribution are those who appear to strongly favor explanations based
on white nativism, racial resentment, and notions of status threat (see Mutz 2018a, b), even if
the argument is sometimes indirect (see Jardina 2019). If there is an opposite end of the
spectrum, it would have to be those who focus on economic populism, inflected by place-based
economic interests, while holding aside whether racial attitudes might be a complementary
narrative (see McQuarrie 2017; see also Judis 2016 for the primary election; cf. Judis 2018). In
this vein, Stiglitz (2018:515) focuses on the core of Trump’s economic appeal:
Trump’s campaign for the presidency exploited discontent amongst large swaths of the American
population. Blaming others – migrants and “unfair” trade practices of other countries – for their
economic plight was much easier and more satisfying than blaming, say, changes in technology
and other changes in the economy and the way the country had managed those changes.
Responding to this diagnosis, Trump promised to renegotiate trade agreements, and to
assert America’s market power. He threatened to impose trade restrictions – in the case of
Mexico and China, tariffs of 20% and 45% respectively – if our trading partners did not respond
“appropriately.” He focused on bilateral trade deficits, promising to reduce those, and by
implication, even more strongly, the multilateral trade deficit. The reasoning was simple: with
less imports (or more exports), employment and wages of his constituents would increase.

9

The argument of those who focus on economic interests is that Trump’s appeal was effective,
even understandable, if accepted by voters in US counties that have had lagging economic
growth for the last several decades.
Most other scholars grapple with how to fit together mechanisms based on economic
interests and racial identity. As noted above, Sides et al. (2017, 2018) give only a small amount
of explanatory power to economic interests, and mostly when economic arguments are
sufficiently “racialized.” This position is similar to the perspective of Abramowitz (2018:140)
that “it really was (mostly) about race.” Norris and Inglehart (2018) discuss the declining
relevance of traditional left-right voting that was driven by economic interests, but they argue
that the sources of the “cultural backlash” that benefitted Trump had diverse origins, including
resentment of lost economic standing. This argument echoes the position implied by the work
of Lamont, Park, and Ayala-Hurtado (2017), which documents the seeming success of Trump’s
effort to praise the dignity of working-class labor and the prosperity it helped to deliver in the
twentieth century.
Closer to the economic interest position, Morgan and Lee (2017b, 2018) emphasize the
complementarity of explanations based on economic interests and racial prejudice, yet still give
more weight to economic interests than most others. In Morgan (2018a), a brief prejudiceincorporating narrative is offered, which casts defections from the Democratic party as a
response to appeals for renegotiated trade agreements and immigration restrictions that could
benefit working-class voters. The voters who responded to the appeal were those with baseline
levels of racial prejudice that did not render Trump’s racialized rhetoric sufficiently
disqualifying.

10

Many other streams of research have developed in response to Trump’s election,
including some that place Trump’s victory in comparative perspective in order to evaluate
whether it should be considered a right populist response (e.g., Bonikowski 2017, Mudde and
Kaltwasser 2018), some that probe the structural conditions that promoted the appeal of Trump
as a “lying demagogue” (see Hahl, Kim, and Zuckerman Sivan 2018), some that investigate
Trump’s appeal to evangelical Christians (Whitehead, Perry, and Baker 2018), and some that
consider the extent to which Trump’s economic arguments had resonance with voters because
of their folk, rather than professional, modality (see Swedberg 2018; see also Stiglitz 2018).
Finally, more work will surely develop that is candidate-specific, assessing the role of bravado
and celebrity in activating base evaluations with little issue-specific rationale, building on the
type of analysis encouraged by Lodge and Taber (2013). A full explanation of the 2016 election
will need to incorporate results and conclusions from a broad range of studies such as these.
Our contribution is to develop conclusions about the observable cross pressures of the 2016
election, as explained above, in order to enrich the debate on the relative importance of Trump’s
appeals to the economic interests and racial identities of his supporters.

Data
We analyze validated voters from the ANES 2016 Time-Series Study (see American National
Election Studies 2017). Details on the selection of the analytic sample are offered in the online
supplement, including how we utilized vote-validation information to code votes cast in 2012
and 2016, as well as votes cast in 2016 among those who did not vote in 2012.

11

Methods of Analysis
The core of our analysis is a comparison of the attributes, attitudes, and issue positions of three
groups of validated voters: Obama-to-Trump voters and two groups of party loyalists, ObamaClinton voters and Romney-Trump voters. For group comparisons such as these, we offer raw
unadjusted differences as well as differences that are adjusted for age, gender, region,
education, and class (as well as race-ethnicity when we do not narrow the analytic sample to
non-Hispanic whites at the outset). For the latter set of adjusted differences, we use logistic
regression to estimate a balancing score based on the adjustment variables. We then use a ratio
weight to standardize the group differences to the target group (Obama-to-Trump voters),
while using the same variables in between-group weighted regression equations to adjust for
lingering imbalance not eliminated by the balancing score.5
Readers of the causal inference literature are correct to infer that this strategy is a direct
analog to doubly robust inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting in the service of estimating
the average treatment effect for the treated. In this case, the “treatment” is simply membership
in the focal group of interest for the analysis, and no assumption is introduced that this group is
a causal treatment of any type. It is simply group membership, and the methods employed are
therefore best thought of as traditional table standardization techniques, often associated with
Kish (1987) and the demographic research tradition that preceded the full development of the
potential outcomes model of causality.

5

Tables S3 and S4 in the online supplement show that the balancing scores perform well, implying that the
additional covariance adjustment plays a very minor role.

12

Measures
Details of the coding of basic demographic variables, education, and class are also available in
the online supplement. We conform to the conventions of the literature. For our modeling of
differences across types of voters, we analyze 92 distinct outcome measures. The most complete
set of results, which models all 92 outcomes separately, is offered only in the online
supplement. For the main text of the article, we group 85 of these outcomes into 24 composite
variables, scaled to have means of zero and standard deviations of one. Not only do scaled
composites promote rough comparability, we are able to effectively reduce the dimensionality
of the data by an appropriate amount in order to preserve space and bring the core patterns into
clear relief (by averaging over redundant variation from single indicators).
All composites and scaling procedures are detailed in the online supplement (see
especially Table S9 for specific question wordings), and our decisions are generally in line with
prevailing practices. Most important, the online supplement presents the additional results that
demonstrate that our findings in the main text are not driven by decisions about whether or
how to construct composite variables.

RESULTS
Who were the Obama-to-Trump voters, and who were the new Trump voters who sat out the
2012 election for a reason other than age? Table 1 presents demographic profiles of these two
groups, along with two reference groups, Obama-Clinton voters and Romney-Trump voters,
among validated voters in the ANES.

Notes: The sample is restricted to those aged 23 or older in 2016, so that those who were ineligible to vote in 2012
because of age were excluded. Working-class categories include IIlb, VI, VIIa, and VIIb. Classes IIIa and V are
generally considered intermediate classes. Classes I and II are professional and semiprofessional workers, while
class IVab includes self-employed workers.

Consistent with Morgan and Lee (2018), Obama-to-Trump voters were more likely than ObamaClinton voters to be members of the white working class. The last four columns restrict the
sample to white-only, non-Hispanic (WONH) voters, and here the class differences are
particularly pronounced.6 In addition, Obama-to-Trump voters were far more prevalent in the
Midwest region, especially when considering WONH voters only.
In contrast, the 2016 Trump voters who chose not to vote in 2012 for a reason other than
age appear to align more closely with Romney-Trump voters, and they were somewhat more
likely to reside in the South. Comparisons by education and class are complicated by the fact
that these voters were also somewhat younger, but overall their distribution is also closer to
Romney-Trump voters. Partly for economy of space, and partly because this second group of
voters is more similar to party-loyalist Republicans, we will offer additional results for this
group of voters only in the online supplement. The Obama-to-Trump voters will be our
primary focus for the remainder of this section.

Cross Pressures and Obama-to-Trump Voters
Table 2 presents a first analysis of cross pressures, measured by political predispositions and
social attachments. As explained in the methods section, the table compares Obama-to-Trump
voters to party-loyalist voters, with and without adjustments for age, race, gender, education,
and class.

The measure of social class is explained in Morgan and Lee (2017a, b), based on a coding of the dominant social
class schema in sociology, updated for use with 2010 census occupation codes (see Morgan 2017 for details). For
implementation with 2016 ANES occupation codes, see the online supplement of Morgan and Lee (2018). For the
current article, the coding across all classes is less precise than desired, because of the detail provided by the ANES
occupation codes. For this reason, we always use the class measure alongside the education measure in this article.

Notes: Standard errors of the differences are in parentheses. The sample is restricted to those aged 23 or older
in 2016, so that those who were ineligible to vote in 2012 because of age were excluded. The raw N varies
slightly by outcome but is usually 550 for the first and third columns and 657 for the second and fourth
columns, with the same 80 Obama-to-Trump voters in both sets of differences. Full details are provided in the
online supplement (see Tables S10-S13).

16

Given the focus of the debate summarized in the introduction, we present results in the main
text only for WONH voters, offering analogous results for all voters only in the online
supplement (see Tables S5-S8).
To understand the table, consider the first row, which reports results for a conventional
seven-point scale for party identification. Without any adjustments (except narrowing the
sample to WONH voters only), Obama-to-Trump voters were 2.195 points above ObamaClinton voters and 2.046 points below Romney-Clinton voters (with standard errors of 0.263
and 0.261, respectively) on a scale of party identification where a 1 is a Strong Democrat and 7 is
a Strong Republican. With adjustments, the differences change little, to 2.296 above and 1.965
points below. The proper interpretation is that Obama-to-Trump voters are mostly centrists on
party identification, which is consistent with the second row of the table that presents
differences for level of conservative ideology. This latter result, however, is based on a fouritem composite variable, the details of which are offered in the online supplement. As noted in
the row label, this conservative ideology composite variable (like all others in this table and
subsequent ones) was scaled to a standardized metric, with mean of 0 and standard deviation of
1. For this reason, the differences for the second row are in standard deviation units and can be
(roughly) compared to differences based on other composite variables (see below). And, for
this outcome, the adjustment matters to some extent. Without an adjustment, Obama-to-Trump
voters are slightly farther away from Obama-Clinton voters. After the adjustment for age,
gender, education, and class (and a perfect match on race), they are more nearly equidistant
from both types of party loyalists. The change is attributable to using the doubly robust

17

weighting estimator to focus the comparison of Obama-to-Trump voters to weighted sets of
party loyalists who have the same marginal distributions on the adjustment variables.
The remaining results in the table show that Obama-to-Trump voters were more likely
than Romney-Trump voters to have involvement with unions and have positive feelings about
them. They were the least interested in politics, in comparison to all party loyalists, and they
were more likely to feel that the rich control politics than were Romney-Trump voters. Obamato-Trump voters did not discuss politics as frequently with family and friends, and they were
more likely to have decided which candidate to support within one month of the date of the
election. Altogether, Obama-to-Trump voters have many of the general predispositions of
cross-pressured voters noted in the literature, especially lower levels of interest and more preelection indecision, matching the original profile constructed by Lazarsfeld et al. (1944).
The final panel of Table 2 presents differences for three composite variables specifically
used to assess a type of support for the “Make America Great Again” theme of the Trump
campaign, interpreted literally. In a piece of scholarship that has mostly fallen off the citation
radar screen, Lipset and Raab (1970) analyze the “Quondam complex,” which they introduce as
“the condition of those who have more of a stake in the past than in the present” (p. 460), then
elaborate as “a preponderance of symbolic investment in the past, related to some past group
identity which has declined in symbolic significance” (p. 462), before qualifying, after its usage,
that it is better thought of as a “descriptive category” than “another analytic category” (p. 504).
Table 2 shows that Obama-to-Trump voters have notable, but not atypical Quondam
tendencies. They are more likely than Obama-Clinton voters to value tradition and the past, but
they are squarely in between both party-loyalist groups in accepting changes in morality. And,

18

perhaps most surprising, they rate higher by a bit than both groups on supporting free thinkers
who have the courage to defy traditional ways. This last finding could point to support for
Trump’s persona, his penchant for defying “political correctness,” or perhaps a more general
desire for change that drew these voters to Trump. Overall, however, Obama-to-Trump voters
appear to have considerably weaker Quondam tendencies than Romney-Trump voters,
especially when accepting changes in morality. This last set of findings is consistent with the
profile of cross-pressured voters, and less so that of the preservatist, right-wing voters who
were of interest to Lipest and Raab in their analysis.

The Economic Interests of Obama-to-Trump Voters
Table 3 presents analogous differences for eight composite variables that measure economic
interests in several different ways, again for WONH voters only. As with all such point-in-time
comparisons, it is impossible to determine how much the views of voters have been shaped by
the positions of the candidates, and a weakness of the ANES project is that many of its
attitudinal measures are collected only after the election.7 Nonetheless, the results in Table 3
suggest that Obama-to-Trump voters are somewhat distinctive. They reported more economic
vulnerability than Obama-Clinton voters, and they were solidly in between both groups on
economic progressivism and economic libertarianism. These differences are slightly smaller for
the models that adjust for gender, age, education, and class.

7

And, since the political environment is always shifting, measures from prior years (which are not available for the
2016 ANES) have their own taint and do not reflect a primordial baseline that can be relied upon while assuming no
elite-oriented distortion. For discussion of how to use prior-year measures, and how not to, see Morgan (2018a, b).

Notes: See Table 2.

Obama-to-Trump voters were more likely than party-loyalist voters of both types to see
global trade as a threat, especially in comparison to Obama-Clinton voters. They were more
centrist on the tradeoffs between environmental protections and job growth, and the large
differences in both directions suggest how much party loyalists consistently differ from each

20

other on this issue.8 In addition, Obama-to-Trump voters viewed the health of the economy in
2016 as much more compromised than did Obama-Clinton voters, and they were less convinced
than Romney-Trump voters that economic opportunities in the US were increasing or that
inequality is stable or trending lower. After adjustments, they may also differ in the same way
from Obama-Clinton voters.
Altogether, Obama-to-Trump voters saw themselves as more economically vulnerable
and the US economy as less healthy than Obama-Clinton voters did. While they were between
both parties on general policy positions, they saw global trade as more of a threat than did
Obama-Clinton voters, and a little bit more of a threat than did Romney-Trump voters. Given
Trump’s economic message on global trade (see the Stiglitz quote in the introduction), it would
not be surprising if some Obama-to-Trump voters helped to resolve their cross pressures by
seizing upon this issue as a reason to defect from Obama to join the Trump coalition.

Racial Affect and Views on Policies to Address Racial Inequality
Table 4 presents ten sets of differences that, overall, suggest that Obama-to-Trump voters had
views on matters of race that, in the main, resembled those of Romney-Trump voters rather
than Obama-Clinton voters. Again, these results are restricted to WONH voters only, but see
the online supplement for analogous results for all voters.

8

Nonetheless, this measure is particularly difficult for a respondent to interpret because of the way the 7-point scale
is worded, including an unreferenced “it” that we interpret as intending to mean “regulate business to protect the
environment” but which a satisficing respondent could interpret as “no regulation,” implying that “no regulation”
“will not work” and “will cost jobs.” It may be that the middle-range responses of this group represent a tendency to
be confused by the question and select values in the middle of the scale.

The overall pattern is clear for racial affect toward blacks and Hispanics, prevalence of
discrimination against whites, support for government spending to help blacks, resistance to
the government offering “favors” to help blacks overcome obstacles, and preference for
majoritarian dominance. Obama-to-Trump voters differed sharply from the perspectives of
Obama-Clinton voters on these matters, but they present a typical profile of generic Republican
voters on these attitudes.
Aside from this baseline similarity across measures, a small amount of more subtle
variation is present. Obama-to-Trump voters professed a bit more support for specific
affirmative action policies than did Romney-Trump voters, while remaining much less
supportive than Obama-Clinton voters. They saw blacks and Hispanics facing slightly more
obstacles, but nowhere near the same degree that Obama-Clinton voters did. Nonetheless, they
departed a bit from Romney-Trump voters, and this pattern is consistent with a more centrist
position on abstract economic policies, and a willingness for government intervention, as shown
above in the prior table.
For specific measures that may tap white nativism, such as the composite for white
racial affect and the measure of discrimination against whites, Obama-to-Trump voters were
perhaps very slightly higher than even Romney-Trump voters. But, these differences, which are
about the sizes of their standard errors in most cases, do not align with other measures, such as
the final indicator for whether whites should work together to change laws unfair to whites (or
the differences already discussed on support for affirmative action).
A key point to keep in mind, and one that we will discuss at length below, is that
Obama-to-Trump voters did indeed vote for Obama in 2012 before defecting to Trump in 2016.

23

Thus, it is hard to argue that these cross-pressured voters have a baseline voting tendency that
is predetermined by fixed racial prejudice of some form. They flipped from one election to the
next, and this sets them apart from Romney-Trump voters. In other words, while the table
shows a lot of similarity between Obama-to-Trump and Romney-Trump voters, their votes in
2012 suggest an important difference on racial sentiment and how it matters for their votes.

Immigration and Racialized Economics
For the last set of differences, Table 5 presents results for four measures that probe attitudes
toward immigration, as well as views on the economic consequences of immigration policy.
Not too dissimilar from the racial attitudes presented in Table 4, the differences in Table 5
suggest that Obama-to-Trump voters were also similar to Romney-Trump voters, and very
much at odds with Obama-Clinton voters. They had more negative attitudes toward all
immigrants, in general and for those who are illegal/unauthorized/undocumented. They were
much more likely than Obama-Clinton voters to believe that immigrants take away jobs and
hurt the economy. And, as a result, they were less likely to favor increases in immigration. It is
possible that they viewed immigration as more of a threat to jobs than Romney-Trump voters,
but only slightly so, and at a level that could be attributed to sampling error. The main
difference is with Obama-Clinton voters, who, like their favored candidates, saw immigration
as much less of a threat to economic security.

Notes: See Table 2.

Given the connection that Trump drew between immigration flows and competition for
working class jobs and wages, as well as the position of Clinton that such connections are only a
minor concern, it is not surprising that this contingent of Obama voters may have resolved their
cross pressures by defecting to Trump. The results presented do not permit a characterization
of this mechanism as more “racial” or more “economic,” and for this reason we adopt the
language of Sides et al. (2018) that this is an instantiation of racialized economics, much more so
than for the types of differences presented above in Table 4.

How Much Additional Clarity Would Many-Cause, Multiple-Regression Models Deliver?
Impatient readers may not appreciate the level of detail in the foregoing tables, and, if so, they
will like the online supplement even less, where the same results are offered for alternative

25

analytic samples and in addition for each underlying indicator (see Tables S10-S13). When the
goal of analysis is to consider groups like cross-pressured voters, who by definition lie in the
interior of the multidimensional cloud of points that relates attitudes and interests to candidate
preferences, adjusted group differences reveal the core patterns in the data that need to be
considered.
In holding this position, we would appear to be in the minority. Most other quantitively
oriented scholars in these debates have centered their analyses on many-cause, multipleregression models that attempt to explain how each of these factors predicts vote choices, net of
each other, and without focusing in any explicit way on the crucial Obama-to-Trump voters. To
allay concerns that we are withholding the insight of such analysis strategies, we offer multiple
regression results in the online supplement (see Tables S14 and S15, and their associated
interpretations in the text). We conclude the online supplement by explaining why we believe
that many-cause, multiple-regression models do not provide the insight that others have
claimed.

CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest seven primary conclusions on Obama-to-Trump voters, based on an
analysis of validated voters in the ANES:
1. Likely more than 5.7 million in number, Obama-to-Trump voters constituted a large
enough share of Trump’s voters that they were essential for his win.
2. They were more likely to self-identify as white-only, non-Hispanic (or WONH, using
our acronym), and especially within this group, had lower levels of education, higher
rates of working-class membership, and lived in the Midwest.

26

Focusing specifically on Obama-to-Trump voters who self-identified as WONH, in the main
text of this article we have offered results that allow us to conclude:
3. They had lower levels of political interest and were centrist in both party affiliation and
ideology.
4. They were more likely to be late deciders for the 2016 election.
5. On economic interests and issue positions, they were centrists, except for trade policy,
which they saw as a greater threat than did both Democratic and Republican party
loyalists.
6. They claimed to have more experience with economic vulnerability than Democratic
party loyalists of comparable social standing.
7. On a broad range of racial attitudes, including the racialized economic topic of
immigration, they had a profile very similar to Republican loyalists, with slightly more
recognition of racial obstacles than Republican loyalists, and slightly more support for
affirmative action.
In the online supplement (see Tables S12 and S13), we offer a set of additional results that
suggest three final conclusions worthy of mention here:
8. Voters who declined to vote for any candidate in 2012 but who turned out to vote for
Trump in 2016 had profiles similar to Republican loyalists on both demographic
characteristics and on attitudes toward race.
9. They were more centrist on economic issues than Republican loyalists, but less centrist
than Obama-to-Trump voters.
10. They had less political interest than Democratic and Republican loyalists, but they were
not late deciders for the 2016 election.
One contribution of this last group of Trump voters was to boost the turnout rate in 2016
relative to 2012, disproportionately for the white working class (see Morgan and Lee 2017b).
Overall, these last three conclusions reinforce our view that it is the Obama-to-Trump voters
who deserve the most interpretive work, but full results are available in the online supplement
for readers who wish to consider this second group more comprehensively.

27

DISCUSSION
With our first-order conclusions in hand, in this section we tackle the harder question: Why did
a substantial number of Obama’s voters defect to Trump, delivering a victory in the Electoral
College? We provide two plausible answers: (1) surging white nativism and (2) economic
populism with bandwagon bigotry. Before presenting the answers, we summarize some
additional empirical results that are vital for understanding why we also argue that the second
answer is more convincing than the first.

Relevant Results from Recent Research
Before developing a more general explanation for the choices of Obama-to-Trump voters, three
sets of related findings from the recent literature should be foregrounded. First, results from
the 2004 through 2016 General Social Surveys (GSS) show that the racial attitudes of whites,
including those from the working class, did not change much for the 2016 election cycle. If any
meaningful change is present, it is one of moderation in opposition to affirmative action and in
racial prejudice (see Morgan and Lee 2017b, Figure S7, for results with 4-item and 11-item scales
of each).
Second, although the field period of the 2016 GSS ended for 98 percent of respondents
before election day in 2016, results from the 2018 GSS suggest that, if any change is present in
the GSS results since 2014, it is clearly in the direction of a further moderation of racial attitudes
(see Holland 2019; https://apnews.com/69f6eccb65b242789a1e86e15d755567 ). In other words, a
comparison of the 2016 and 2018 GSS results to previous years provides evidence that should
allay the eminently reasonable concern that Trump’s emphasis on identity issues has pushed

28

the racial prejudice and resentment of whites higher since he officially entered national politics
in 2015.
Third, work with the ANES is consistent with the GSS in demonstrating little or no
change in the racial attitudes of whites between 2012 and 2016, and the ANES measures were
mostly collected in close proximity to the elections (usually for the November-December postelection surveys). This lack of change is not particularly clear in the work that has emphasized
identity mechanisms. Sides et al. (2018), for example, offer many claims about changing
associations between vote choices and attitudes using the 2012 and 2016 ANES data, but only in
their final chapter (see Figure 9.3) do they present results that demonstrate that both the 2016
ANES and GSS do not align with the implicit claim throughout the book, which is that whites
were attracted to Trump because racial identity had been powerfully activated within the
electorate. Likewise, Jardina (2019; Table 3.2), in a book that comprehensively examines the
specific activation of white identity in modern US politics, shows that a comparison of the 2012
and 2016 ANES data reveals no increase (and possibly a decline) in “white racial identity”
between 2012 and 2016. However, the finding is deemphasized, and the book concludes
without a direct analysis of the 2016 general election using the ANES data, leaving the overall
claim – that whiteness is a major emergent issue in national politics – rather less than fully
evaluated as a determinant of the 2016 general election.9

9

Jardina (2019) analyzes ANES data from the 2016 primaries, using what is known as the 2016 ANES Pilot Study.
She also uses the 2016 general-election ANES data (the same “Time-Series Study” we analyze) to consider the
distribution of white identity (Table 3.2), which did not change between 2012 and 2016, and also for other types of
analysis (see, e.g., her Tables 4.2-4.5, 8.1). In our reading, we can find no results in the book that use the available
ANES 2016 Time-Series Study data to directly analyze the relationship between white identity and the 2016 general
election outcome. For her analysis of the 2016 general election, she opts instead to use briefly a two-wave YouGov
study that she fielded with some of her own measures, and which appears to have 480 valid respondents (and, we

29

The importance of these results deserves emphasis. The ANES and GSS, which are
widely regarded as the highest quality surveys available on these matters, could have provided
evidence for movement in racial attitudes consistent with concerns about a surge in white
nativism. They do not provide any evidence to support the existence of such a surge, and these
results must be folded into a consideration of how best to interpret the cross-pressured voters
that broke for Trump at the end of the campaign. We now turn to the first plausible answer for
why many cross-pressured Obama voters defected to Trump.

Possible Answer: Surging White Nativism
This argument begins with the 2012 election. In that election, Romney engaged in standard
“racial politics,” nudging voters to think about race indirectly by using facially race-neutral
arguments about government dependency. The best example was his leaked talk to donors
where he stated on May 17, 2012: “There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the
president no matter what … who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are
victims.” Campaigning in this way, he reminded Republican voters that he agreed with the
positions most strongly associated with Reagan’s campaign against welfare dependency, with
its clear racial overtones, but without the explicitness that less urbane politicians would
embrace.
When then considering how to vote in 2012, a sufficient number of cross-pressured
voters decided to support Obama, in part because their economic centrism left them
unimpressed by Romney. He was characterized by the Obama campaign as an out-of-touch

assume, uses YouGov’s much-criticized weighted quota sampling strategy of opt-in empaneled respondents, unlike
the full probability sample of the ANES).

elitist, whose personal wealth was generated by advising firms to lower the wages of workers.
These cross-pressured voters supported Obama because they wanted to give him another four
years to see if he could grow the economy in an equitable and balanced way, and the support of
labor unions, who reminded them of Obama’s auto bailout and other stimulus funding, was a
crucial factor in their thinking. Altogether, according to this explanation, Romney did not
prime racial sentiments overtly enough to excite white voters, and thus the cross-pressured
voters from the working class resolved to support Obama for economic reasons.
When Trump campaigned in 2016, the election had an entirely different feel, not just
because of the absence of an incumbent. Following from the “white nativism” explanation
advanced in the literature, it must have been the case that white voters, especially those from
the working class, saw the election this way:
While Clinton uses her campaign speeches to celebrate diversity and global citizenship, Trump
speaks about how powerful America was in the past, and that this power had nothing to do with
diversity. Instead, it was white Americans who won wars and built the modern economy.
Trump is courageous to point out that America’s security is threatened by Muslims, and
its government overwhelmed by Mexicans who entered the country illegally. And he is obviously
correct in reminding everyone that America’s manufacturing base has been undermined by
globalists who want to embrace all other nations, rather than support their own.
For these reasons, Trump is right that the country cannot return to its greatness without
looking to what worked in the past. Clinton is wrong when arguing that the goal of eliminating
racial inequality is essential for moving the country forward. Such inequalities are inevitable, for
complex reasons, some of which cannot be changed, and Trump is right that the government
should align itself with the people of the country who have given the most in the past. It is
patriotic to celebrate American greatness, and one should not feel ashamed that it was mostly
white Americans who are responsible for that greatness.
Thinking in this way, many white voters, especially those with low levels of education who had
never experienced the sort of diversity that is typical of institutions of higher education, or
coursework that values it, chose to shift loyalties from Obama to Trump. Their loyalty to

31

Obama was narrowly instrumental in the first place and had little or no affective foundation. In
contrast, the way Trump spoke about the country was something they could get excited about.
Is this explanation correct? It is hard to dismiss it as unreasonable, and surely many
voters responded to Trump’s campaign in a way that could be quite similar to our
characterization above. The question that must be confronted, however, is whether this way of
thinking can be attributed to those who actually voted for Obama in 2012. It is more likely, we
think, that voters prone to this type of effervescent white nativism are precisely the sorts of
voters who have favored Republicans consistently. Obama-to-Trump voters had not been
convinced in 2012 by Tea Party activists, or the widely reported 2011 birtherist claims of Trump
himself.10 They had instead decided to turn out to support Obama, despite their underlying
prejudice. For this reason, the thinking above seems much more applicable to voters who either
(1) supported Romney in 2012 because the Democratic party does not welcome bigotry or (2)
did not vote in 2012 because neither party endorsed white supremacy.
Still, it is possible that Trump’s identity rhetoric was convincing in a new way in 2016,
perhaps because of the appeal of his bombast, and that some Obama-to-Trump voters
supported him primarily because of it. The only thing we are absolutely certain of is that we
are not among those convinced by arguments of the sort advanced by Mutz (2018a, b), which
suggest that many white Obama voters came to regret their 2012 votes, fell into an affective trap

10

Perhaps most notable, Trump stated on April 7, 2011 on NBC’s Today Show, “I have people that have been
studying [Obama’s birth certificate] and they cannot believe what they’re finding ... I would like to have him show
his birth certificate, and can I be honest with you, I hope he can. Because if he can’t, if he can’t, if he wasn’t born in
this country, which is a real possibility ... then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics.” See

in defense, and then were transformed in 2016 because Trump brought out their latent feelings
of status threat.11

A More Convincing Answer: Economic Populism with Bandwagon Bigotry
We see a larger role for economic interests in their own right, directly considered and acted
upon. 12 To understand our position on the 2016 election, we recommend that readers first
search for the words “trade” and “job” in the many online sources for the transcripts of the
three presidential debates in 2016. Trump was relentless, and Clinton almost defenseless, when
he argued that jobs had been lost to China and Mexico and that he, by restricting immigration
and renegotiating trade deals, could bring them back. This is the argument summarized by
Stiglitz (2018), as presented in the quotation in the introduction.
Here is how this explanation is structured, in light of the evidence that Obama-to-Trump
voters differed from Democratic loyalists in their racial attitudes: First, the explanation for
supporting Obama in 2012 is largely the same as presented above for the first stage of the
“surging white nativism” explanation. When voting for Obama in 2012, Obama-to-Trump
voters indicated a willingness to hold aside their racial prejudice because Romney was
unappealing, especially on economic matters.

11

Mutz’s particular argument has no support because of methodological errors in her first piece, even apart from
measurement assumptions that are hard to accept (see Morgan 2018a, b).
12

We should note also that many Obama voters from the working class, especially those who self-identify as nonwhite or Hispanic, found Trump’s rhetoric on race disqualifying. These voters mostly supported Clinton, but it is
unknown whether some of the turnout decline of non-whites in the Midwest could have resulted from unresolved
cross-pressures that prevented some of these voters from turning out to support Clinton. Some of these voters may
have supported Trump’s trade and immigration proposals, but the ANES sample is too small to support a direct
analysis.

33

By 2016, these voters, who had generic Republican levels of racial prejudice already,
viewed Trump’s identity rhetoric as unexceptional and thus largely ignorable. They believed
that supporting employment in manufacturing, as Obama did in the Midwest for the
automobile industry, was a reason to have voted for Obama in 2012, and especially when the
alternative was a candidate who built his own personal wealth by recommending the overseas
outsourcing of jobs. These voters also saw their sentiments toward recent immigrants not as
prejudice, nor as a defense of national culture, but simply as a reflection of their view that lowskilled immigrants are a threat to employment security for working-class voters in their states.
They could not accept what they heard Democrats claiming, which was that debates over
immigration are not economic at their core, and they were offended that media commentators
imputed racist motives to what they felt were legitimate economic concerns.
Finally, if many WONH Obama-to-Trump voters had felt genuinely race neutral,
perhaps using the reasonable justification that they had voted for Obama only four years prior,
then voting for Trump would not feel like a racist act, nor even a deplorable one. If these same
voters were cross pressured and associated regularly with other voters who had palpable
enthusiasm for Trump’s overall message and style, then the path of least resistance in
navigating the cross pressures may have been to vote for Trump. It could almost seem harmless
to do so if the media was correct in predicting that Clinton would cruise to a victory anyway.
And, if some of these voters instead savored a change of pace in national politics, even a
transgressive disruption to the Washington establishment that Clinton had been a part of for 25
years, then Trump would surely deliver, and perhaps also strengthen the economy at the same
time.

34

We do not, of course, have direct evidence for many of the components of this
explanation, but it is consistent with the results we have presented. And, we see a lot of
inconsistency between empirical results and explanations that focus instead on some version of
surging white nativism. If white identity was activated so effectively that group identity is the
most important factor to consider, one would expect to see measures of racial prejudice,
opposition to affirmative action, and white racial consciousness to have increased in 2016 for
whites and then, probably, increasing further since Trump took office. The evidence that we
have seen all runs counter to this implication. Racial attitudes, and new measures of white
identity, show no direct evidence that Obama-to-Trump voters, or even Trump voters in
general, changed in the direction suggested by the surging-white-nativism explanation.
The biggest change that we have seen since 2015 is the strong perception on the part of
voters that Trump favored unprecedented restrictions on immigration and renegotiated trade
agreements, and the evidence is consistent with the idea that these positions won him centrist
voters prone to appeals grounded in economic populism. Because voters who were repelled by
Trump’s identity rhetoric did not shift to support him, the bandwagon predominantly attracted
generically bigoted voters who differed little from Republican loyalists on average levels of
racial prejudice and white nativism.

Additional Detail on Data and Measures
We analyze the December 18, 2018 release of the 2016 ANES Time-Series Study. Many of our
decisions on how to construct the analytic sample, and then code our measures, have a parallel
rationale to those undertaken for Morgan and Lee (2018), as explained in the online supplement
to that article. Nonetheless, the goals of the current article are more wide ranging, and the data
source is limited to only the “validated voter” subsample of the ANES. For these reasons, most
of the same decisions must be re-explained because there are small differences that need to be
documented.

ANES and the Restriction of the Sample to Validated Voters Only
The primary difference for the sample considered in this article is that the analysis is restricted
to the subset of all ANES self-reported voters who were validated by a public records match to
have actually voted. Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai (2018) explain the vote validation
procedures implemented for the ANES.
The goal in using the vote-validated subset of the ANES is to head off criticism that
groups like Obama-to-Trump voters did not actually vote. While it is always possible that
respondents are misleading the ANES investigators on whom they voted for, the voter
validation procedures can, to a reasonable degree of accuracy, eliminate from the sample
individuals who claimed to have voted but did not. It is not possible to validate self-reported
vote choices for particular candidates in the ANES, or any other data source, only whether
individuals actually voted.

1

Details of the Analytic Sample
The ANES 2016 Time-Series Study (N = 4,270) consists of two separate samples – both of which
target a nationally representative sample of eligible voters in the United States – but that differ
in the mode of interview (and, very slightly, in population coverage). One sample (N = 1,180)
consists of respondents who sat for face-to-face interviews, and the second sample (N = 3,090)
consists of respondents who took an internet-based survey.1 Although the target population
and sampling methodologies are slightly different, both samples aim to represent English and
Spanish speaking US citizens aged 18 or older (and, thus, likely eligible to vote). Both samples
include data from two waves: pre-election and post-election. The pre-election surveys were
conducted for two months prior to the general election (between September 7 and November 7,
2016), and the post-election surveys were conducted between November 9, 2016 and January 8,
2017.
Given our interest in analyzing the 2012 preferences of 2016 voters, we first restricted
our analytic sample to the 3,648 respondents who completed both the pre- and post-election
surveys, since the information on vote choice for the presidential election in 2016 could only be
drawn from the post-election survey.2 We then further restricted the sample to respondents
who were aged 23 or older at the time of the pre-election survey, thereby dropping an

1

In the December 18, 2018 release of the ANES 2016 Time-Series Study, the version we analyze for this article, one
respondent from the previous release was deleted. Therefore, the initial sample size in this article differs by one
respondent from Morgan and Lee (2018). Nonetheless, the deleted respondent reported not voting in the 2016
presidential election, and thus was not in the core analysis of Morgan and Lee (2018).
2

In addition, because of their incompatibility with the ANES panel weighting scheme, we excluded 23 ANES
respondents who did not complete post-election interviews but whose presidential vote in 2016 could be determined
because they voted early. Our sample includes other early voters who completed the post-election survey, and these
are weighted appropriately to account for all early voters.

2

additional 187 respondents. The rationale for the exclusion by age is both substantive and
methodological, as discussed in Morgan and Lee (2018).3
For most of our analysis, and unlike Morgan and Lee (2018), we exclude 1,323
respondents who were not validated as having voted by a public records match in 2016 (see
Enamorado et al. 2018).4 After these exclusions, our analytic sample included 2,138 ANES
respondents (631 from the face-to-face interview sample and 1,507 from the internet-based
sample).

Decisions on Coding Small Amounts of Missing Data for Demographic Variables
Age. For the final analysis sample of validated voters, 52 respondents (2.4 percent) were
missing information on age. We used best-subset regression imputation for age for these
respondents, using information on their gender, race, region, education, and class. The imputed
values have some variation but are almost certainly a bit closer to the mean of age than would
be the case if all the genuine values were known. Because we are using age only as an intervalscaled adjustment variable, and the measure is valid for 97.6 percent of the sample, we are
confident that a more elaborate imputation strategy would not improve the analysis
appreciably.

3

We briefly bring back these younger respondents for a side analysis in this supplement, where we estimate the
shares of types of Trump voters in 2016. See below.
4

Nonetheless, we do not follow the vote-validation categorization in one case. We continue to exclude respondents
who self-reported that they did not vote in the 2016 presidential election, and this group includes 58 respondents
who were validated as having voted in the 2016 election. These respondents are of three types that cannot be
separated exactly: (1) those who were erroneously validated as having voted, (2) those who voted in the election but
did not cast a vote in the presidential contest, and (3) those who forgot or refused to admit that they voted in the 2016
election.

3

Gender. For gender, 16 respondents did not provide an answer, but we were able to
develop a reasonable categorization for many by using the interviewers’ observation included
in the file as paradata. However, 7 respondents remained without a clear gender category, and
we decided to include them in the category for female for three primary reasons. First, there
were too few of them to create their own “missing” category, like we created for education and
class. Second, gender is only an adjustment variable for our analysis and is not of fundamental
interest for this particular article. Third, none of the remaining 7 were in our focal category of
Obama-to-Trump voters. Instead, 5 were Obama-Clinton voters, 1 was a Romney-Trump voter,
and 1 was a “don’t know/refused” in 2012 who voted “other” in 2016. Altogether, we decided
that the simplest solution was to place these 7 voters in the “female” category, since the vote
information is most consistent with such a placement. In an unreported side analysis, we
determined that moving these respondents into the “male” category would have no discernible
effects on the core of the analysis.
Race. For this article, we define the whiteness of central concern to be “white only and
non-Hispanic,” and we use the acronym of WONH for this group. Respondents in this category
indicated that they do not consider themselves to have any type of Hispanic ethnicity/ancestry
when responding to the Hispanic ethnicity question, and they selected only “white” from
among the options for race. Accordingly, multiracial whites and white Hispanics are both
excluded from the constructed category of WONH for this article.
Among the 2,138 respondents in the core analytic sample, 20 respondents were missing
information on race (i.e., did not provide a response for any of the options for race). Of these 20
respondents, 2 respondents were also missing information on Hispanic ethnicity. We took the

4

following decisions for these 20 respondents. Given our focus on a single indicator for WONH,
we were able to determine that 11 of the 20 respondents missing on race did not belong to the
WONH group because these 11 respondents indicated that they had some type of Hispanic
ethnicity. We cannot further determine whether the remaining 9 respondents should be
categorized as WONH (because we do not know their race, even though they indicated that
they did not have Hispanic ethnicity).5 After contemplation, we decided to categorize this
group of respondents as not in the WONH group, which is the core group considered in the
article. For the analysis with all respondents, they are included. For analysis restricted to
WONH respondents, they are excluded.

Composite Variables for Data Reduction, and Question Wording for All Items
As noted in the main text of the article, our primary results are based on 92 separate outcome
variables. The ANES questions, response scales, and other information on each item, are
provided in Table S9. The table is organized by the order in which results are presented in
Tables 2 through 5.
As discussed in the main article, we grouped 85 of these 92 outcome variables into 24
standardized composite variables, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the results for the
main presentation (although see below in Tables S10-S13 supplementary results that use all
indicators as well). Each of these 85 items is listed with the corresponding composite variable in
Table S9, with all question wording and response scales provided.

5

Among these 9 respondents, none were Obama-to-Trump or Romney-to-Clinton voters. For these 9, 2 voted
Obama-Clinton, 3 voted Romney-Trump, 1 voted for Obama in 2012 but refused to answer for the 2016 election, 1
refused to answer for the 2012 election and voted “other” in 2016, and 2 refused to answer for both elections.

5

Rationale for Composite Variables. We do not claim that the composite variables are
formal scales. In nearly all cases, we simply follow prevailing practices in the literature for the
construction of composite variables (although our sense is that the churn on the time-limited
ANES survey instrument across years has hindered the development of a clear set of standards
that has achieved a consensus). We cannot help, nonetheless, in differentiating our strategy a
bit, and so in this section we detail our thinking about one particularly important set of
measures.
The ANES has deployed a four-item, agree-disagree pseudo-battery on racial attitudes
for many election cycles on its post-election survey. The statements are presented to
respondents as
1.

“Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up.
Blacks should do the same without any special favors.”

2.

“Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for
blacks to work their way out of the lower class.”

3.

“Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve.”

4.

“It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they
could be just as well off as whites.”

These items are often combined and labeled as a scale of “racial resentment,” and there is a
methodological debate on whether this scaling is reasonable. The argument for such a scaling is
based on classical test theory and asserts that items 1 and 4 are overt racial resentment items
while items 2 and 3 are reversed items that measure the same underlying construct.
We take an alternative position, in part because there is reason to expect that responses
to items 1 and 4 can trend independently of responses to items 2 and 3 (and more generally
because we are not convinced that classical test theory should be invoked for only four items

6

and for a concept with three domains – one about obstacles faced, one about how much the
government should do to lessen the impact of those obstacles, and one about an amorphous
level of current desert, responses to which are probably shaped by the prior item on the
presence of structural obstacles).
Thus, because our interest is in developing a profile of group differences, without
reducing the full dimensionality of the data unnecessarily, we do not combine these four items
into a single scale. Instead, we combine items 1 and 4 into a composite variable that we label
“Blacks should work harder and should not receive favors.” We analyze this measure
alongside a composite for opposition to affirmative action based on other items. We then
combine item 2 with an additional two measures on perceptions of the level of current
discrimination against blacks and Hispanics, yielding a composite variable that we label “Blacks
and Hispanics confront racial obstacles.” Finally, we combine item 3 with two other measures
for a composite variable we label “Government should help blacks.” All of these decisions are
revealed Table S9.
What are the consequences of this decision? Not much, as can be inferred by examining
the indicator specific models in Tables S10-S13. Nonetheless, for skeptical readers, we have also
created a standardized four-item racial resentment scale and pumped it through the same
analysis routine. Recall the results in Table 4 in the main text, where we consider racial
attitudes for the subsample of WONH respondents only. If we were to add a row for a fouritem racial resentment scale, the numbers would read across such as row as:

7

Racial resentment (standardized composite of 4
variables)

1.290

0.019

1.004

-0.026

(0.115)

(0.096)

(0.086)

(0.095)

For comparison, here is the row from Table 4 for the 2-item scale that uses only items 1 and 4
from above:
Blacks should work harder and should not
receive favors (standardized composite of 2
variables)

1.270

0.066

0.951

0.007

(0.109)

(0.082)

(0.089)

(0.079)

The results are nearly the same, and so in this case our principled alternative decision is not
consequential for the pattern of conclusions. Like most everything in Table 4, the pattern for
racial resentment is the same: Obama-to-Trump voters have racial attitudes that match closely
those of Republican loyalists, not Democratic loyalists.
In all other cases, our categorization choices are standard, as best we can determine.
But, because we cannot fully determine what the standards are, we are also completely
transparent. First, we offer details in Table S9 for any readers who wish to consider
alternatives. Second, we provide indicator-specific models in Tables S10-S13 so that readers can
get a sense of how the results would change if the indicators were recombined in other ways.
Construction of Composite Variables. To create each composite variable, we used the
following three-step procedure. First, all items in the composite were specified for a principalcomponents factor analysis, after which the first factor was extracted. Because the computed
factor is based on the listwise-present sample of respondents across all items specified, in the
second step we used best-subset linear regression to impute the factor from the same set of
items. This second step filled in a (typically small) amount of missing data on the factor, using
whatever items had valid data across all respondents (see Tables S10-S13 for Ns). The imputed

8

factor then has a valid value for all individuals who had a valid value for at least one item in the
composite. In the third step, we standardized the factor to have mean of zero and a standard
deviation of 1 across the full analytic sample (excluding the groups of voters who are not used
in our core analysis, primarily Romney-to-Clinton voters and voters who voted for Clinton in
2016 but did not vote in 2012).

Supplementary Results
Obama-to-Trump Voters and Romney-to-Clinton Voters
Tables S1 bridges the ANES analysis in Morgan and Lee (2018) with the analysis reported in this
article. Table S1 shows that restricting the sample to validated voters in the ANES does not
appreciably alter the results or conclusions from the prior article. The rates of Obama-to-Trump
voting are nearly the same. If anything, the results on 2016 voters who did not vote in 2012 for a
reason other than age are more strongly aligned with the claim that white, working-class voters
turned out in greater numbers for Trump than white voters not in the working class. This
enhanced support for that article’s conclusions aligns with the turnout results in Morgan and
Lee (2017) based on an analysis of CPS-VRS data. It is also consistent with past research by
others that respondents with higher levels of education are usually thought to be more likely to
claim that they have voted when they did not actually vote (perhaps because social desirability
bias is highest for them).
Table S2 repeats the same analysis but flips attention to Clinton voters. We provide this
table to forestall concerns that by ignoring Romney-to-Clinton voters in the core analysis of this
article we are hiding a pattern of results that does not align with our main conclusions. Table S2

9

shows that this is not a concern. Romney-to-Clinton voters are much smaller in number and are
not drawn disproportionately from members of the white working class. Likewise, 2016
Clinton voters who did not vote in 2012 for a reason other than age are less likely to be from the
white working class (and, overall, she secured many fewer of these voters than did Trump, as
can be seen from a comparison of Tables S1 and S2).
While defections from the 2012 Republican candidate to the 2016 Democratic candidate
are certainly relevant to the overall voting pattern, they are of secondary importance for our
purposes in this article. Our goal is to investigate how Trump assembled the particular
coalition of voters that secured him a victory, and with that goal in mind it is the Trump voters
who deserve the most focused attention.

The Distribution of Trump’s Voters
Among all respondents to the ANES post-election survey, Trump’s winning coalition of voters
consisted of four primary groups, but the relative sizes of these groups depend on
categorization decisions that we show here, and also whether vote validation information is
used.6
Without vote validation and relying only on self-report data, the ANES data suggest that
•
•

66.4 percent (s.e. of 1.6) of his voters supported Romney in 2012
13.5 percent (s.e. of 1.3) supported Obama in 2012

6

For the calculation of the distributions in this section, we exclude 16 respondents who were validated as voters in
2012 and 2016, and who said they voted for Trump in 2016, but who refused to answer for whom they voted in 2012.
However, we do include 1 respondent who was a validated voter for Trump in 2016, and who is not a validated voter
for 2012. This person indicated “don’t know/refused” for whether he voted in 2012. Although it makes no
discernible difference for the results in this section, we decided to categorize this single person as a member of the
21.3 percent of 2012 non-voters, and more specifically the 8.9 percent we call “clear cases of 2012 non-voters.” For
this individual, muddled seems a better descriptor than clear.

10

•
•

14.9 percent (s.e. of 1.2) were eligible to vote in 2012 but did not vote
3.7 percent (s.e. of 0.8) were not eligible to vote in 2012 because of age7

Incorporating 2012 and 2016 vote validation information, the ANES data suggest
•
•
•
•

61.9 percent (s.e. of 1.8) of his voters supported Romney in 2012
11.8 percent (s.e. of 1.4) supported Obama in 2012
21.3 percent (s.e. of 1.4) were eligible to vote in 2012 but did not vote
3.4 percent (s.e. of 0.9) were not eligible to vote in 2012 because of age

We can further subdivide the group of 2012 eligible voters who did not vote, yielding a total of
six groups
•
•
•

•

61.9 percent (s.e. of 1.8) of his voters supported Romney in 2012
11.8 percent (s.e. of 1.4) supported Obama in 2012
21.3 percent (s.e. of 1.4) were eligible to vote in 2012 but did not vote
o 8.9 percent (s.e. of 1.1) were eligible to vote in 2012 but coded by us as “did
not vote” because they were not vote validated for 2012 and also selfreported that they did not vote for a candidate in 2012 (aka, “clear cases of
2012 non-voters”)
o 9.1 percent (s.e. of 1.0) were eligible to vote in 2012 but coded by us as “did
not vote” because they were not vote validated for 2012, and even though
they self-reported that they did vote for a candidate in 2012 (aka, “2012
fakers”)
o 3.2 percent (s.e. of 0.7) were eligible to vote in 2012 but coded by us “did not
vote in 2012” because they self-reported that they did not vote in 2012, even
though they were validated as having voted in the election (aka, either
“mistaken 2012 validated voters” or “2012 validated voters who chose not to
vote for president in 2012”)
3.4 percent (s.e. of 0.9) were not eligible to vote in 2012 because of age.

As can be seen in these results, there are choices to be made about how to use the vote
validation information, when one seeks a distribution that incorporates 2012 turnout and vote

7

There is one exception. 10 post-election survey respondents under the age of 22 self-reported that they voted for a
candidate in the 2012 presidential election. After determining that none of them were validated voters, we
considered them to be ineligible to vote in the 2012 election based on age.

11

choices. In general, vote validation increases the sizes of the categories of non-voters, shifting
voters out of both the Romney-Trump group and the Obama-to-Trump group.
Our estimate in the main article is that Obama-to-Trump voters were at least 9 percent of
Trump’s 62.985 million voters, and thus we write of at least 5.7 million voters who gave him the
victory in the Electoral College. This number uses the standard error above, resulting in the
calculation of 11.8 – 2*1.4 = 9.0. (The corresponding upper bound with these numbers would be
11.8 + 2*1.4 = 14.6, for an upper bound estimate of 9.20 million based on the ANES validated
voter sample.) It is worth remembering that the margins of victory were very small in four
crucial states: Florida (112,911, a number equal to 2.4 percent of Trump’s voters), Pennsylvania
(44,292, a number equal to 1.5 percent of Trump’s voters), Michigan (10,704, a number equal to
0.5 percent of Trump’s voters), and Wisconsin (22,748, a number equal to 1.6 percent of Trump’s
voters). These vote totals are the basis of our claim that Obama-to-Trump voters were crucial
for Trump’s victory in the Electoral College.

Overlap and the Balance Achieved by Inverse Probability Weighting
As shown in Tables S3 and S4, party loyalists of both types are sufficiently diverse that it is not
difficult to weight them toward the distributions of Obama-to-Trump voters (or as we show
below, 2016 Trump voters who did not vote in 2012 for a reason other than age). Our logit
specifications deliver weights that work quite well, and we use the same predictors to eliminate
remaining imbalance for adjusted differences throughout the article and in this supplementary
appendix. The first three columns of Tables S3 and S4 report balance that is relevant to the

12

models that utilize all respondents. The last three columns of each table report balance that is
relevant to the models that utilize only WONH respondents, as presented in the main article.

Modeled Differences for All Validated Voters (WONH and non-WONH Together)
Tables S5-S8 are analogous to Tables 2-5 in the main article. The sample is augmented to
include non-WONH voters. For these additional models, we also balance the WONH
distribution by augmenting the logit specification using an indicator variable for WONH voters.
The balance achieved by weighting is shown in the first three columns of Tables S3 and S4, but
we also use the same measures that generate the weights as covariates in the final models.
Overall, augmenting the sample does not change the results dramatically, mostly
because WONH voters are the largest contingent of Obama-to-Trump voters. A comparison of
Tables 2 and S5 implies that Obama-to-Trump voters who are non-WONH are more likely to be
conservative and to identify as Republicans (perhaps suggesting that they defected from the
Republican party in 2012 to support Obama because of their enthusiasm for a multiracial black
candidate). Nonetheless, the sample size of the ANES is too small to enable precise modeling of
this group. We report the WONH results in the main article because they are at the core of the
debate in which we are engaged.

Indicator-Specific Results, and Additional Samples
The next four (very long) tables in this supplement include results from the indicator-specific
models, referenced in the main article, and placed in order in the tables after the compositebased results. Tables S10 and S11 provide results for the comparison of Obama-to-Trump
voters to both Obama-Clinton and Romney-Trump voters, and the two tables are differentiated

13

by whether the sample is restricted to WONH voters or not. These are the source tables for the
numbers presented in Tables 2-5 and in Tables S5-S8, which are in the rows that are colored red
in Tables S10 and S11.
For Tables S12 and S13, we then offer parallel results for the group of 2016 Trump voters
who were eligible to vote in 2012 but did not vote in 2012 for a reason other than age. Although
these results suggest many nuanced patterns, a reasonable overall interpretation is that these
voters are more similar to Republican loyalists who voted in both 2012 and 2016 than were
Obama-to-Trump voters (see Table 1 and also our final set of conclusions in the main article).
Thus, while they may include within their ranks some voters who represent the small turnout
surge considered in Morgan and Lee (2017), our sense is that the bulk of these voters are of the
regular variety and should be thought of as the typical “churn” that characterizes our
presidential elections, with roughly similar proportions of types of eligible voters participating
each election, but not necessarily the same voters. More detailed reporting of these results
would certainly be worthwhile, and they are provided for readers so inclined.

Multiple Regression Results for Demonstration and Critique
In our final set of results, we offer estimates from many-cause, multiple-regression models in
Tables S14 and S15. We offer these final results only to convince the reader that the usage of
regressions of the conventional sort does more harm than one might expect when seeking to
understand the role that cross-pressured voters played in the 2016 regression.
In Table S14, we present results from eighteen logit models. The outcome variable for
each model is voting for Trump in 2016. The models are estimated for WONH voters only, and

14

all models adjust for age, gender, region, education, and class. The focal predictor variables are
fourteen variables that were selected to represent the predictors from Tables 3-5, and we limited
them to fourteen variables to fit the table on one page only for efficiency of presentation.
For the first two columns, we stack results from fourteen separate models, one for each
focal predictor (i.e., a model that specifies the variable in the row label as a predictor, along with
covariates for age, gender, region, education, and class). For the middle two columns, we stack
results from three separate models. The first specifies the predictors for economic interests
together, the second racial attitudes, and the third immigration attitudes. The final two
columns present results from a single model that specifies all fourteen focal predictor variables
and is, for this table, the veritable kitchen-sink model. The numbers in the cells are the average
probability differences associated with a one-unit change (usually a standard deviation) in each
of the fourteen variables, as well as the standard errors of these average probability differences.
Columns 1, 3, and 5 use the full sample of WONH voters validated for 2016, and
columns 2, 4, and 6 use a sample further restricted to non-defectors only. The restricted sample
drops Obama-to-Trump voters and Romney-to-Clinton voters.8
The table reveals two clear patterns. First, there is a striking similarity between the
results in each pair of columns, and regardless of how many associations are estimated at the
same time. The results appear to be determined by party loyalists only. Second, the sensible
and easy-to-interpret associations in the first two columns are progressively washed out as

8

For consistency with other analyses in the article, we also remove from the full sample as well as the restricted
sample a few individuals who self-reported that they were Obama-to-Trump or Romney-to-Clinton voters, but who
were validated voters only in 2016. Thus, as was the case for other tables, these self-reported switchers were not
retained in the analysis as genuine switchers.

15

more predictors are specified at the same time. It is nearly impossible for us to interpret what
these net associations mean when all are estimated at the same time for the final kitchen sink
model, but readers may see more clarity than we do.
Table S15 then presents average probability differences of voting for Trump that are
analogous to those in Table S14. But, for Table S15, six indicator variables (for the 7 possible
categories) of party identification are included in all models. As a result, all estimated average
probability differences are smaller because of the known strong association between party
identification and vote choice. In addition, the similarities within pairs of columns decline a bit
for the following reasons. Defectors have centrist party identifications, as shown above, but, as
Table S14 shows, tend to lie gently within the cloud of points. When the defectors are in the
models, and party identification is specified to partial out the partisans, the associations
between predictors and vote choices are just a bit slightly stronger because of the net
covariation contributed by the lingering centrists. Thus, when the defectors are dropped, the
net associations decline slightly. For this reason, the differences between Tables S14 and S15 are
generated by the regression specification, which may or may not be appropriate, depending on
one’s position on whether voters express their centrist tendencies because they are indicating
that they are about to defect from the party identification implied by their prior vote. Our
position is that Table S14 provides a clearer perspective on what these types of models
accomplish, as we now explain.
Why have we not included these models in the main text? We do not believe they are
worth the space in a substantive article such as ours because they do not provide sufficient

16

insight. In fact, multiple regression does not deliver as much general insight as others have
claimed for the following two reasons: variable anthropomorphism and interior thresholds.
For the first, it is clear that variables do not determine election outcomes. Not only do
variables not vote, but many variables are measures that have been invented by social scientists
to categorize individuals. These variables are “behind the back” factors that are valuable to
social scientists in our research but are not usually part of the self-justifications that individuals
construct when deciding how to cast their votes. Accordingly, no social scientists actually
maintain that “white nativism,” “racial resentment,” or “social dominance orientation”
determine election outcomes by structuring deliberate choices by voters.
We do not object to such measures, and indeed many of these measures represent the
successes of professional social science in providing useful characterizations of individual
behavior. In our analysis in the main text, we attempt to avoid too much anthropomorphism by
organizing our analysis as comparisons between types of voters, primarily Obama-to-Trump
voters versus party loyalists, but also groups defined by sociodemographic characteristics. As
such, the outcome measures are used to characterize groups of voters, defined by (mostly fixed)
attributes and the votes that they cast.
If one reads how regression methodology is employed in much of the work on the 2016
election that has pushed the group-identity and status-threat perspectives, the variables we
treat as outcomes to be differenced are instead causes that determine how the votes were cast,
as if voters are divisible agglomerations of different amounts of each variable who can be sliced
and diced and recombined for the rows of a regression table. In these models, cross-pressured

17

voters are the ones most violently pulled apart and implicitly redistributed across rows of a
regression table.
It is somewhat surprising to see the continued prominence of this style of work,
especially for an election that is so vital for the social sciences to understand. In sociology, the
downside of these approaches has been broadly appreciated at least since the publication of
Lieberson (1985) and Abbott (1988). Moreover, political science has its own rich theoretical
tradition of vote-choice models at the individual level, attuned to electoral coalitions forged by
appeals to the median voter. In recognition of this literature, as well as advances in
perspectives on causal inference, many political methodologists have called for changes in
empirical work (see, e.g., Sekhon 2009).
For interior thresholds, we mean that vote choices are binary acts, and thus threshold
crossing decisions. Often, regression results are written up as if the regression coefficients work
in deterministic fashion for all voters, including cross-pressured ones and party loyalists. For
example, the fact that white, working-class voters are more prejudiced against non-whites and
also more likely to favor Trump must therefore mean that one of the reasons they voted for
Trump was because of active consideration of how their prejudice matched Trump’s. It appears
to be impossible, following this line of thinking, that these voters could fail to recognize their
own prejudice, which may simply be a part of a constellation of attitudes that characterizes their
social networks and group affiliations. Nor could they appear to recognize their prejudice but
decide to hold that prejudice aside when picking a candidate that they felt would best represent
their economic interests, which led them to candidates in 2012 and 2016 from different parties.

18

In other words, in research of this type it appears impossible for an individual to make a
threshold-crossing decision without using all of the dimensions that the researchers have
specified in their regression models, or to combine any of them in a way that cannot be read off
the regression coefficients altogether. This type of analysis is all the more compromised when it
is recognized – as Table S14 suggests – that the regression coefficients for the 2016 election were
determined mostly by party loyalists, whose minds were made up many months before election
day.
We do not want to close by leaving the impression that regression methods are never
appropriate for use. That is clearly not the case, and many areas of the social sciences have been
advanced when they are used skillfully, including political science and political sociology.
However, the outcomes of close elections are different, and require care in analysis.
Understanding the multidimensional orientation of a cloud of points, and then using all of the
slopes of the cloud to construct a full causal narrative, is unlikely to elucidate the decisive
factors at the individual level (i.e., the decisions of voters who joined the winning coalition, but
almost did not). A perfectly specified regression model could do so, if backed by a causal graph
that all can accept as compelling, and with careful attention to voter-level heterogeneity of
effects. That is not what has been offered in the regression work on the 2016 election, and we
are pessimistic that a full structural model of this type can be offered with the sorts of data
sources that are available.

Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses, and the raw N is the unweighted number of respondents in the corresponding
cell of the table. All percentage calculations are based on weighted results, and we exclude 6 respondents who were
missing information on education and class. Respondents are considered non-voters for the 2012 presidential election if
they were either not validated as a voter or even though validated as a voter reported on the post-election survey that
they did not vote (i.e., we assume they were either incorrectly validated or voted in the election but did not vote
specifically in the presidential contest). The results in columns 1, 3, 5, and 6 are trivially different from those in Morgan
and Lee (2018) because after revisiting our coding decisions, with access to the validated data, we decided to move 1
respondent from the “did not vote” category to “don’t know” for 2016 and 2 respondents from the “other” candidate
category to “did not vote” in 2012.

Some people feel that the government in Washington should
make every effort to improve the social and economic
position of blacks. Suppose these people are at one end of a
scale, at point 1. Others feel that the government should not
make any special effort to help blacks because they should
help themselves. Suppose these people are at the other end,
at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions
somewhere in between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where

Notes: Standard errors of the average probability differences are in parentheses. The sample is restricted to those aged
23 or older in 2016, so that those who were ineligible to vote in 2012 because of age were excluded. The raw N varies
slightly by model (from 1,415–1,488 for the first column to 1,337–1,375 for the second column). Additional cases are lost
to listwise deletion for subsequent models, so that the Ns for the corresponding kitchen sink models in the last two
columns are 1,376 and 1,300.
