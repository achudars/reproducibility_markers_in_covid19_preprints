Tourism and environmental quality nexus: Further evidence from Malaysia, Singapore
and Thailand

Abstract
The central aim of this study is to contribute to the encroachment of knowledge on impact of
tourism on environmental pollution by CO2 emissions ASEAN-3 namely Malaysia, Thailand
and Singapore during 1990-2014. The FMOLS results reveal that the impact of tourism
variable on environmental pollution is significantly positive, while for Thailand and
Singapore, it is found negative and statistically significant. Empirical findings suggest that
sustainable economic development should be ensured by implementing prudent public policy,
where tourism industry needs to be expanded further but fulfilment of its responsibility
towards maintaining green and sustainable environment must be top most priority.
Keywords: Tourism; environmental pollution/ CO2 emissions, ASEAN
Introduction
Tourism contributes enormously towards the economic development of host countries.
Globally, many developing countries rely largely on tourists’ spending which accounts for
significant contribution to GDP of those countries. According to Ashley et al. (2007) tourism
contributes almost 40% of GDP in developing economies and approximately 70 % of GDP in
case of very small island economies. However, with reference to developed and more
diversified economies the contribution of tourism in term of GDP lies in the range of 2 % to
12%. Moreover, according to most recent report by world tourism and travel council (WTTC)
approximately 1.2 billion tourists travelled internationally in 2015; thus tourism industry
contributed US$ 7.2 trillion i.e. 9.8% of world’s GDP and generated 284 million jobs i.e.
9.5% of total employment opportunities globally (WTTC, 2016a). These figures reflect the
substantial role of tourism in economies worldwide. Tourism influences the economy of host
countries in multiple ways; through employment generation, infrastructure establishment,
tourism related value chain development and other dynamic effects on socio-economic
dimensions of lives of domestic population (Tang & Abosedra, 2014; Tang & Tan, 2013;
Apergis & Tang, 2013; Ashley et al., 2007).
However, the other side of the picture is quite dismal and gloomy. On, one hand tourism
industry serves as a catalyst for economic growth of tourism led economies; whereas, the flip
side of coin illustrates that there are numerous hazardous effects of rapidly increasing
tourism. Some of those hazards are economic (uneven development, income inequality,
geopolitical risks, rising costs of materials); whereas, others are environmental (extreme
weather conditions and climate change, emission of greenhouse gases, water and other
resources scarcity, excess consumption of energy) and social (child labour and forced labour,
human trafficking and sex tourism, culture and heritage protection) in nature (Mowforth &
Munt, 2016; WTTC, 2015). It is immensely feared that positive aspects of tourism would be
overshadowed by the aforementioned negative aspects if serious efforts are not made towards
promoting socio-economically viable and environmentally sustainable tourism worldwide.
2

The focus of this study is on socio-economic significance of tourism and its impact on
environmental quality (climate change) in a few tourism-led economies in Southeast Asia
namely Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. The travel and tourism (T&T) industry of
Malaysia has experienced rapidly increasing growth over the previous few decades owing to
the focused governmental endeavours and intensive campaigning to declare Malaysia as
tourists’ favourite destination (Ng, Lye & Lim, 2016). T&T plays a significantly crucial role
in the Malaysian economy in terms of economic growth which is clearly represented by
constant improvement in the rankings according to the contribution to the national economy
in 2013. T&T contributed RM 1.5 billion to the gross national income (GNI) that reached up
to 16.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 (Tourism Malaysia, 2014). In 2015, travel
and tourism industry contributed MYR 152.8 billion which represents 13.1% share in GDP.
In addition, travel and tourism industry created almost 1.5 million direct and indirect
employment opportunities which account for 11.4% of total employment opportunities in
Malaysia. In 2015, the total amount injected in travel and tourism industry of Malaysia was
approximately MYR 20.7 billion which represents 6.9% of total investment in Malaysian
economy (WTTC, 2016b).
Irrespective of tremendous contribution of T&T industry to the economic progress, it is still
an uphill task for the industry to maintain a positive outlook in terms of its expansion and
growth. With the promulgation of Islamic and medical tourism as its backbone, Malaysian
government has rendered its undoubted devotion to strengthen and support the tourism
industry. However, Blanke & Chiesa (2013) observed Malaysia’s challenging situation to
cope with the growth momentum when the T & T sector declined two points in the global
index of T&T competitiveness among 140 countries in 2013, from the 32nd place in 2008, as
mentioned in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness (T & TC) Report 2013. This decline
happened quite unexpectedly and without any indications; however, the industry managed to
learn some alternative methods to carry out tourism business more successfully. With
particular focus on quality and environmental dimensions, several basic initiatives can be
taken in this regard. More recently, analytical reports and newspapers identified some factors
i.e. travelling, hotels, accommodation, other facilities and services that cause T & T industry
to be a significant contributor in global greenhouse emissions (Doyle, 2014; UNEP, 2015).
Air travelling and accommodation predominantly rely on huge energy consumption
(Gossling, 2002; Tovar & Lockwood, 2008; Gossling et al., 2010), which consequently result
into greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 (see Becken, Simmons & Frampton, 2003;
Becken, 2005; Liu et al., 2011; Katircioglu, 2014a; Solarin, 2014). This becomes more
relevant in case of Malaysia where its position in terms of environmental management
ranking eventually declined and the environmental sustainability rating deteriorated to 61
from 44 in 2008, as mentioned in the updated version of the 2013 T&TC Report (Blanke &
Chiesa 2013). This decline was further supported when Malaysia was ranked at 103 in 2013,
dropping from 86th position in 2008 with regard to CO2 emissions (Blanke & Chiesa, 2013).
It must be remembered that environmental quality degeneration can’t be treated as an
insignificant matter any further, as poor air quality would subsequently obstruct travel
demand and upcoming progress opportunities (Kelly & Williams 2007; Pang et al. 2013).
3

Finally, the countries in pursuit of their developmental objectives are deemed to have
incurred additional costs caused by rapidly emerging environmental consequences and
climate change (Shahbaz et al., 2015).
Likewise, tourism industry provides tremendous support to socio-economic development of
Thailand. In 2015, travel and tourism industry contributed THB 2,795.1billion which
represents 20.8% share in GDP. It is predicted that the contribution of travel and tourism
industry would account for THB 5,420.5 billion i.e. 30.5 % share in GDP in 2026. It indicates
per annum growth rate of 6.4%. Besides, travel and tourism industry created almost 6 million
direct and indirect employment opportunities which account for 15.4% of total employment
opportunities in Thailand. In 2015, the total amount injected in travel and tourism industry of
Thailand was approximately THB227.4 billion which represents 6.8% of total investment in
Thailand economy (WTTC, 2016c).
Similarly, with reference to Singapore, the role of travel and tourism industry in economic
development is quite significant. In 2015, travel and tourism industry contributed SGD 39.5
billion which represents 10% share in GDP. Moreover, travel and tourism industry generated
almost 310,500 direct and indirect employment opportunities which account for 8.5% of total
employment opportunities in Singapore. In 2015, the total amount invested in travel and
tourism industry of Singapore was SGD 19.8 billion which represents 19.9% of total
investment in Singaporean economy (WTTC, 2016d).
According to Wilson (1994) tourism being the most prominent industry of Singapore is also
considered as one of the largest industries of Asia Pacific region. Keeping in view the
economic context, Katircioglu (2014b) authenticates that hypothetical relationship between
tourism and growth is suitable for economic setup of the Singapore where it serves as the
locomotive sector. In this regard, Chang and Wong (2003) examined the linkage of oil price
shocks with the economic scenario of Singapore, which has significant implications for
energy sector. The findings revealed that oil price shock has a very minimal impact on
Singapore economy, irrespective of Singapore’s status as net oil importer. Xuchao et al.
(2010) carried out an analytical research regarding energy consumption and CO 2 emissions
mainly caused by hotel industry in Singapore. A well-established and feedback relationship
between electricity consumption and economic development in Singapore is found to have
been established by Yoo (2006) as well. On the contrary, Karki et al. (2005) have advocated
that economy of the Association of South East Asian Nations is prospering at surprisingly
dynamic rate, in terms of rapidly increasing urbanization, diversified energy resources and
technology oriented industrialization. However, Karki et al. (2005) have also reinforced that
during previous two decades this region has undergone a changing trend with more emphasis
on sustainable development concerns with respect to worsening environmental conditions,
energy security and financial constraints in energy-oriented ventures. Thus, owing to these
developments, tourism expansion in Singapore is likely to have potential influence on
environmental quality and standards.

The very constructive role played by the tourism sector can’t be overlooked in the process of
economic growth and development and thereby promoting social welfare. At the same time,
the environment and economic growth has a close relationship, where clean and green
environment is necessary for improving social wellbeing. Therefore, the broad objective of
this study is to explore the impact of tourism on environmental pollution for three countries
from ASEAN namely Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand during the period ranging from 1990
to 2014. Though, there are some more or less related studies available but to the best of the
authors’ knowledge, current study is among the pioneer studies on these three ASEAN
countries. Moreover, set of regressors, time period and estimation methodology is different
compared to the erstwhile studies. Thus, it is expected that the outcomes will guide the
management constituting public policies for tourism and environment. Consequently, it will
boost economic growth and development and hence social welfare of the people in the
region.
The study is structured as follows: Section 2 deals with review of literature. Section 3
presents empirical methodology. Section 4 discusses empirical results. Section 5 presents
summary and conclusion. Lastly, policy implications and recommendations for future
research are presented in section 6.
2. Literature Review
In recent years, the linkage between tourism and its impacts on socio-economic factors has
drawn considerable attention from academicians. However, the relationship between tourism
and climate change still remains an under investigated scholastic domain.
Mirbabayev and Shagazatova (2006) have attributed tourism as environment friendly industry
which does not involve chimneys. However it does not necessarily frees local government
from all types of responsibilities. There are very few empirical studies, if any, which have
examined the tourism and environmental concern linkage in the light of time series analysis.
This research takes up the challenging objective to investigate the effects of tourism
development on environment with relation to CO2 emissions. Where the outcome results of
tourism development appear to exhibit increasing levels of CO2 pollutants, remedial policies
need to be formulated and implemented as the prime responsibility of tourism department.
Beladi et al. (2009) in their study examined a small open economy dealing with tourism
related taxes in the form of pollution tax. However, their findings revealed that where taxes
can potentially decrease the emission levels, they can simultaneously make tourism more
expensive.
The relationship between tourism development and CO2 emissions is spelt out in the context
of economic and transportation activities by consumption of domestic energy. Transport
sector being the central factor of tourism development provides the tourists with best possible
movement facility from the sources to their destinations (Yeoman et al., 2007). With
reference to air, sea or land destinations, everywhere the routes are predominantly reliant on
energy as the actual fuel source which resultantly ends up in CO2 emissions. The
international flow of tourists has been employed as key indicator in a recent research that
5

focused on the pollution effects of tourism expansion with respect to its future implications
(Mayor & Tol, 2010). Their findings revealed that the demand of transport trips is likely to
increase with the pace of tourism expansion in coming years and specifically in Asian
countries, where the fuel consumption in traffic facilities is considered as determining factor
of pollution emissions. Keeping in consideration the economic activities, several researchers
have considered the tourism expansion to be the consequential outcome of ever-expanding
economic activities (Dritsakis, 2004; Durbarry, 2005; Kim et al., 2006). Following the line of
research by Zhang and Cheng (2009), Chang (2010) has recently discovered how economic
growth ultimately results into higher levels of CO2 emissions so far as energy consumption is
concerned. Ghobadi and Verdian (2016) performed a study using research sample containing
380 families and 384 tourists from Noushahr, Iran. Findings of the study revealed that there
is a substantial correlation between the environment effects and tourism in the country.
However, findings of the study suggested some appropriate policy measure for encouraging
tourism, and clean environment. Azam and Khan (2016ab) empirically proved that
urbanization, investment, energy consumption, and trade are also the main factors
determining environmental pollution by CO2 emissions.
Zhang and Gao (2016) found that the tourism-induced Environmental Kuznets Curve

hypothesis does not exist in China (Central) and is merely weakly support observed in China
(Eastern and Western) during 1995–2011.
The aforementioned empirical studies show that both tourism and the environment are
playing key role in the development of any economy. However, still there is lack of inclusive
study on the tourism and environmental pollution in the context of Malaysia, Thailand and
Singapore. Thus, the broad aim of this study is to explore the tourism and environmental
pollution relationship for three ASEAN countries and thereby reduce the gap and further
advance knowledge on tourism and environmental pollution correlation.
3. Empirical Methodology
3.1Data &Source
This study has employed World Development Indicators (WDI) data set of Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand for the period of 1990 to 2014 to measure the dynamic impact of
tourism on environment quality. For the environmental quality proxy, we (the authors) have
considered CO2 emissions per capita in metric tonnes. This includes CO2 emission produced
during consumption of gas flaring, solid, and liquid fuels. Tourism is our concerned variable
which is the total number of arrivals in the host country per year. Explanatory variables of the
study include GDP per capita (constant 2010). Moreover, we have considered energy use
(EU, kg of oil equivalent per capita).
3.2 Model Estimation
3.2.1 FM-OLS approach
We have applied the fully modified ordinary least squared regression approach (FM-OLS) to
measure the dynamic impact of tourism on CO2 emission along with respective control
variables.

….eq. (1)
In Model 1, refers to the error terms while
is dependent variable (here it can be
CO2 emissions), is the intercept, refers to the vector slope coefficients and
is the
vector of independent variable including tourism. We have analysed our model by applying
FM-OLS regression due to few distinct features. This approach was initially applied in a
study by Phillips and Hansen (1990) to retrieve the unbiased estimators of co-integrating
regressions. Primarily, this method modifies ordinary least squares (OLS) to eliminate the
potential endogeneity bias problem, where OLS is unable to address. In addition, FMOLS
addresses the serial correlation problem. The FM-OLS estimator is asymptotically unbiased
and fully efficient in the presence of mixture normal asymptotic. The co-integration
estimation of FMOLS is carried out by the standard Wald tests using asymptotic Chi-square
statistical inference.
Assuming the following linear regression model:

3.2.2 Gregory- Hansen Co-integration under Structural Break
We apply Zivot–Andrews (2002) approach to examine the order of integration of our
variables. This approach is efficient in detecting the potential structural break that may occur
over the study period. Zivot–Andrews approach has two alternative versions as follows.
k

X t  b  bxt 1  ct  bDTt   d j X t  j  t .........................eq (10)
j 1

k

X t  c  cxt 1  ct  dDU t  dDTt   d j X t  j  t ..............eq (11)
j 1

Where the dummy variables indicated by DUt refer to a mean shift at each point with time
break while DTt is showing the time break for each variable. So, DUt = 1 ….. if t> TB or 0
……. if t<TB. Moreover, DUt = t-TB ….. if t> TB or 0 ……. if t<TB.
The null hypothesis of unit root break date c=0 indicates that the series is not
stationary with a drift nor having information about structural break point. While c<0
hypothesis implies that the variable is found to be stationary with one unknown time break.
Zivot-Andrews (2002) unit root test considers all potential break points and estimates them

successively and finally picks the break when c ( c  1)  1 from the region where the end
points of the sample period are excluded. More importantly, we have applied GregoryHansen (1996a and 1996b) framework for co-integration that considers the single
endogenous structural breaks. Our CO2 emission and tourism model is as follows.
….Model 1
Where refers to the white noise error,
is the dependent variable (here it can be CO2
emissions), is the intercept, is the vector slope coefficients of the model 1 and is the
vector of independent variable. Gregory and Hansen (1996a and 1996b) proposed three
different models with variant assumptions.

8

Model: level shift with trend
…………………...eq(12)
Model: Regime shift where intercept and slope coefficients change
………..eq(13)
Model: Regime shift where intercept, slope coefficients and trend change
………eq(14)
In the above equations, Y is the dependent variable while X are independent variables.
Moreover, k is break date while is dummy variable such as:
.
The above frameworks endogenously determine a single break and provide the predicted
time of break within the sample. The frameworks select break date where the test statistic is
the least vis-à-vis the absolute ADF test statistic is the highest. Finally, we have compared the
calculated value of this approach with MacKinnon (1996) critical value to ensure breaks.
4 Result and Discussion
4.1 Unit root and structural break test
We have applied Zivot–Andrews (2002) to examine the status of unit-root and presence of
structural break of our series. Table 1 reports the results. CO2 emissions per capita are
characterized as unit-root for all three countries, indicating that current CO2 emissions level is
significantly influenced by lagged CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, CO2 emission is stationary
after taking first difference. LGDP is non-stationary at level but it is stationary after taking
first difference case of all three countries.

Likewise, LTOU is non-stationary at level but stationary after first difference for all three
countries. Nevertheless, Table 1 reports that LEU is stationary at level in the case of Malaysia
while LEU is stationary after first difference in the case of Singapore and Thailand. Table 1
also reports all these four variables have break point.
4.2 Tourism and environmental quality
9

The detection of the stationary status of our variables in Table 1endorsees the appropriateness
of using FM-OLS. We have scrutinized the impact of tourism on CO2 emission in the context
of three ASEAN countries where tourism sector play a vital role in promoting economic
development. Besides, we have exhaustively discussed in the review section about the
linkage between tourism and CO2 emission.
Table 2 presents the results obtained from FM-OLS estimator. It shows that LGDP is
positively and significantly associated with CO2 emissions while LGDP2 is negatively and
significantly associated with CO2 emissions in the case of Malaysia. This implies that
environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is valid for Malaysian context. Our finding
coincides with the study of Saboori et al. (2012). The Table 2 also reports that energy use
positively and significantly fosters carbon emission in Malaysia. Positive and significant
coefficient of tourism indicates that tourism degrades environment by augmenting CO2
emissions in Malaysia. This finding indicates that inward flow of tourists in Malaysia
significantly augments energy use, hence CO2 emissions. Few recent studies argue that
energy-led service sector is responsible in increasing carbon intensity (Al-Mamun et al.,
2014).

In the context of Singapore, LGDP is positively and insignificantly associated with
CO2 emission while LGDP square is negatively and significantly associated with CO2
emission. This implies that environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is not valid for
Singapore context. Table 2 also shows that energy use positively and significantly fosters
carbon emission. Regards to the tourism, it negatively and significantly improves
environmental quality by reducing CO2 emission in Singapore. Our finding is in line with the
anecdotal fact of Singapore. The country adopted massive initiatives to decorate country with
gardening and planting more flora and fauna in the landscape of Singapore. Singapore has
been recognized as the Garden City after decades of planning and cultivation (Centre for

10

Liveable Cities, 2015). Therefore, the earning from tourism industry is utilized for the
betterment of the health of environment in Singapore.
Regards to Thailand, LGDP is negatively and significantly associated while LGDP2 is
positively and significantly associated with CO2 emission. This implies that a further increase
of GDP foster CO2 emission at a larger rate in Thailand. Table 2 also shows that energy use
positively and significantly fosters carbon emission. Regarding tourism, negative and
significant coefficient of tourism indicates that tourism improves environment by reducing
CO2 emission in Thailand. Our findings clearly indicates that while other factors remain
constant, an augmentation of tourism sector reduces CO2 emission while an increase of GDP
(perhaps industrial sector) fosters CO2 emission in Thailand.
4.3 Robustness Check: Assumption of structural break
We have applied Gregory–Hansen co-integration approach to detect the potential structural
break over our study period. Table 3 presents the result. The result is consistent with long-run
relation under Change in Level and Change in Regime and Trend. For instance, ADF and Zt
tests consistently confirm the existence of co-integration between CO2 emission and tourism
under the two assumptions. Table 3 also detects the year of breaks, which mainly occurred in
1997 in the context of Malaysia.

Summary and Conclusion
Usually, tourism industry is considered as a supportive industry and plays a substantial role in
the improvement of the society at different stages and is perceived as an imperative step to
accomplish sustainable development. This study aimed to empirically explore the effect of
tourism by the total number of arrivals in the host country per year for three ASEAN
countries namely Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand over the period of 1990-2014. The
Zivot–Andrews test has been employed for the unit-root and presence of structural break in
the data. Results showed that CO2 emission per capita is characterized as unit-root for all
three countries, indicating that current CO2 emission level is significantly influenced by
lagged CO2 emission. Nevertheless, CO2 emission is stationary after taking first difference.
The fully modified OLS results reveal that regressor GDP has significantly positive
relationship with environmental pollution (CO2 emissions), while the square of GDP found is
negatively and significantly associated with environmental pollution in the case of Malaysia.
12

These results imply that Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is valid for Malaysian
context during the period under the study. Positive and statistically significant coefficient of
tourism indicates that tourism degrades environment by augmenting environmental pollution
in Malaysia. This finding indicates that inward flow of tourists in Malaysia significantly
augment energy use, hence environmental pollution. In case of Singapore, the estimated
coefficient of tourism variable is negative and statistically significant, meaning that it
improves environmental quality by reducing CO2 emission in Singapore. The impact of GDP
on environmental pollution is positive but statistically insignificant, while GDP square is
negatively and significantly associated with environmental pollution. This implies that
Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is not valid for Singapore. Energy use positively
and significantly fosters environmental pollution. In case of Thailand, tourism and
environmental pollution has significantly inverse relationship. This implies that tourism
improves environment by reducing environmental pollution in Thailand. GDP has
significantly negative, while GDP square has significantly positive impact on environmental
pollution in case of Thailand, thereby corroborates the environmental Kuznets Curve
hypothesis. These results indicate that a further increase of GDP would foster environmental
pollution at a larger rate in the country. Energy use positively and significantly expands
environmental pollution. These empirical findings evidently demonstrate that ceteris paribus,
an augmentation of tourism sector reduces environmental pollution, while an increase in GDP
(perhaps industrial sector) fosters environmental pollution in Thailand.

Policy Implications and Future Research

Empirical findings of the study suggest some policy recommendations for further expansion
of tourism industry and maintaining clear and green environment as both play crucial role in
promoting economic growth and development. It is possible to formulate an adequate and
appropriate economic policy that encourages tourism activity with respect to economic
development and energy protection as well the environment. Several strategies can be applied
to achieve this goal. Policy about sustainable low-carbon economy needs to be implemented
where output of greenhouse emissions is smallest. It is suggested that Malaysia, Singapore
and Thailand require changeover to a low-carbon economy. Developing balanced tourism
models in these countries may secure the preservation of natural resources, environment and
ecosystems through the growth paths that would help to condense the environmental
pollutions. All these economies need to make efforts and develop low-carbon tourism model,
where well panned coordinated tourism development strategy needs to be prudently executed
to promise that the fundamental policy and planning are conducive to sustainable growth1.
In order to promote sustainable tourism growth, the governments must engage proactively in
creating awareness and spreading positive word of mouth pertaining to merits of green
tourism among tourists. Besides, detailed policies and action plans must be devised and
communicated to reveal how CO2 emission reduction mechanisms can be materialized. Such
efforts would serve as a guideline regarding how future expansion and growth in tourism

should be managed in the ASEAN region in particular and other worldwide tourist
destinations in general. Moreover, the governments should introduce and enforce
environmental taxes in order to preserve the environment in frequently visited tourist
destinations. Trade permits must be issued to those who urge to engage in any commercial
activities requiring them to pay appropriate price for exploitation of environmental resources.
Those who fail to comply with guidelines of environmental friendly commercial activities
must be heavily penalized and their trade permits must be cancelled. Pricing environmental
problems would result in multiple benefits which include financial gains for tourism sector,
minimizing environmental pollution and controlling depletion of natural resources.
Furthermore, governments should facilitate and provide incentives to those businesses that
may employ green and low carbon technologies and utilize alternative sources of energy for
transportation, logistics, accommodation and other tourism related activities in order to
reduce CO2 emissions and avoid overexploitation of natural resources. Governments in the
ASEAN region must also shake hands and collaborate with each other to take active
measures for sustainable tourism which should apply to all kinds of tourism i.e. eco tourism,
educational tourism, recreational and adventure tourism and cultural tourism.
The crux of aforementioned discussion is that achieving the goal of green tourism requires
comprehensive efforts from all parties directly or indirectly involved in tourism activities.
Those who share the responsibility of controlling CO2 emissions and other hazardous
pollutants as well as using environmental resources economically comprise of individuals
(tourists), businesses (transportation, accommodation, and other travel and tourism related
service providers) and policy makers and law enforcing agencies (ministries of tourism and
environment supported by interior ministry and legal system).
Future researchers can conduct further studies in ASEAN region to validate the findings of
the current study in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore in particular and other tourist countries
in the region in general. Future research can be particularly useful in keeping track of the
varying impact of changes in economic and environmental policies of any given country. As
governmental policies change with the passage of time, it is essential to continually monitor
the utility and effectiveness of those policies. Moreover an active and ongoing research is
crucial not only for furthering green tourism but also for striking the right balance among
three pillars of sustainability which refer to social sustainability, environmental sustainability
and economic sustainability. Hence future academicians can engage in research that examines
the interconnected variables through which all the pillars of sustainability can be further
strengthened and may result in holistic socioeconomic development of countries largely
reliant on growth of tourism sector.
