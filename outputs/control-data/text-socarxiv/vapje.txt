Abstract
This paper will explore and explain the Self-Beneficial System of Trade, also known as the
SBST. The Self-Beneficial System of Trade is an original systematic framework whose purpose
is to describe human motivation. The implications of the SBST are clear descriptions of the
strategies used to motivate people into selecting a specific option. This paper will focus on
techniques practiced by companies to persuade customers into purchasing their goods and
services. These strategies are derived by manipulating the mathematical relationships of the
elements within the proposed system, which then have real-world implications for marketers,
managers, psychologists, sociologists, and many other situations where human motivation plays
a role.
Keywords: motivation theory, social exchange theory, microeconomics, marketing, utility theory,
and consumer behavior

Introduction
The Self-Beneficial System of Trade (hereafter referred to as the SBST) is an original
systematic framework developed by Christopher Morel. Its purpose is to describe human
motivation. The SBST aims to achieve this by identifying the elements in the decision-making
process and describing their relationships to one another mathematically. Through these
relationships we may infer strategies used to motivate a person to make a particular decision.
So, in this paper, we will begin by explaining the elements of the SBST and comparing
these explanations to a hypothetical example of a person going through the decision-making
process. By utilizing both methods, in the description of the SBST, a more holistic
Understanding should be established through the recognition of how each element works with
one another, rather than only expressing them as disparate parts.
The next section will describe the persuasion strategies that have been identified by the
SBST, these will mainly be compared to marketing and debating strategies. Both marketing and
debating involve the persuasion of a person to take specific actions, so through the alignment of
strategies found in the SBST and strategies used by people in these fields it should prove as
corroborating evidence for the claims made by the SBST.
Then, possible applications of the SBST will be discussed, as the SBST (even in its
preliminary state) can be applied to many scenarios in real-life by academics and non-academics
alike.
Finally, this paper will describe the limitations of the SBST and provide avenues of
further research for those who are capable and willing.

Research
The research done to develop the SBST involved the accumulation of knowledge from
across the internet and life-experiences, where it was synthesized through conceptualization and
enhanced with inspiration. The only use of information that was directly applied to the SBST
was Social Exchange Theory, in the creation of the Three Benefits. It should be acknowledged
that Utility Theory does have a resemblance to the SBST. However, this was not used in its
development. Any resemblance to Utility Theory or any other ideas, besides Social Exchange
Theory, should be treated as convergent evolution of thought.
The manner in which the effectiveness and accuracy of the SBST were measured was
through the search of conflicting and corroborating sources of evidence.
It was assumed that the SBST would have diverging views on motivation, as compared to
the status quo of motivation theories, this was not the case as many ideas found in modern
motivation theories can be found in or applied to the SBST.
In search of corroborating evidence, this researcher looked primarily towards
advertisements and mechanisms used by companies to convince consumers to purchase products.
No mechanism of motivation was found that conflicts with the claims of the SBST, instead all
the researched advertisements could describe their persuasiveness through the SBST. How these
advertisements could be described through the SBST (and examples of these advertisements)
will be further described in the section titled “21 Strategies Implied by the SBST” in this paper.
The researcher also attempted to apply it to his daily life in assessing the persuasive
elements found in day to day living. Again, no conflicting sources of evidence were found.
However, this research includes a multitude of events that can neither be replicated nor
adequately expressed so they will not be described in this paper. Although, since it was part of
the research, the researcher thought it would be necessary to disclose its role in the research
process.
Although no traditional experiments were conducted, this researcher hopes that providing
corroborating sources of evidence will be adequate in proving the value of the SBST in its
current, preliminary state. It is also hoped that its current state is sufficient to encourage other
researchers to conduct further examination of the SBST through traditional means of analyses.

Science of the SBST
As shown in the research section, the scientific method was not used in the development
of the SBST. As such, the SBST should not be considered scientific. The intent of the SBST in
its current, preliminary, state is to be useful to academics and non-academics alike. As shown in
the strategies section and applications section of this paper, the SBST (even in its current state)
can be used in many scenarios involving human motivation: for the sake of recognizing a
person’s motivations, predicting a person’s future decisions, and even purposefully altering a
person’s motivations.
Although the SBST is not scientific, it does make several testable claims about human
motivation. These claims can be validated (or invalidated) by the scientific method, and I would
encourage other researchers to apply the rigor of the scientific method to the SBST for further
analysis.
In the SBST’s current state, its claims have been validated by corroborating evidence.
This corroborating evidence, expressed in the numerous hyperlinks and lengthy citations of this
paper, has been taken from easily accessible sources so that they may be reviewed by academics
and non-academics alike. It is hoped that the readers will be able to use this evidence to enhance
their comprehension and see how the claims of the SBST are mirrored in reality – so they may
find ways to utilize the SBST in their own lives, products, and careers.
Jenny’s Decision: The Hypothetical Example of the SBST in action
Since the SBST is a systemized framework, it requires a Subject to be used by the SBST
for it to be functional. Although, the SBST can be applied to real people to do so would require
vast participants whose answers are affected by biases and research conditions, as well as
requiring permissions from institutions and the consent of participants. I would implore
researchers to take this line of study, however it is beyond my grasp as an independent
researcher.
So, in this paper, we will use a conceptual Subject (named Jenny) to see the SBST in
action. Jenny is a generic hypothetical character who was designed to be both familiar and
comprehensible to the readers. By comprehending Jenny at a conceptual level, we may be able to
empathize with her choices and the decision-making process she uses to reach her choices.
Context for Jenny’s Decision
Jenny is a high school student who has poor spending habits (resulting in a moderate
credit debt and little money of her own). She has recently gotten her driver’s license but is still
uncomfortable with driving. Jenny also has a dream of one day becoming a famous guitarist and
wants to buy a new guitar to achieve this dream. She plans to put money aside, for buying her
first guitar - and has been doing so for quite some time. Jenny has told others about her dream
and received varying responses (some positive and some negative), but she is still dedicated to
achieving this dream. Although disliking kids, as a source of income, Jenny tends to babysit for
Kyle, a father of two kids, whom she has come to respect.

Jenny has recently arrived back home from school and has received a text from Kyle. The
text reads as follows: “Hey Jenny, it’s Kyle, can you come over tonight to babysit the kids for
$50?” Jenny knows that she has schoolwork she should complete and by babysitting for Kyle
she’s foregoing the perks of staying home, like watching TV and completing her schoolwork,
although she would likely disappoint Kyle by refusing him. If she chose to go babysit for Kyle
she would have to deal with his kids, but she would likely receive $50 for her work and Kyle
would appreciate it. So, Jenny is faced with a decision.
It should be noted that the context described above has been shortened and placed into
the pictorial representation of the SBST. Although context should be used in conjunction with
the SBST, the brief context placed in the pictorial representation is not necessarily an element of
the SBST, as the succinct nature of it removes much of the pertinent information in
comprehending the Subject’s (in this case, Jenny’s) character and the situation that the Subject
finds itself in. The purpose of this brief context in the pictorial representation of the SBST is to
be used as a reminder of the Subject’s context for the reader.
We will study the decision-making process that Jenny goes through, as she is offered to
babysit Kyle’s kids for the night for 50 dollars.
Explaining the Elements of the SBST
Option Comparison Table
The Option Comparison Table is the pictorial representation of the SBST where Options
are compared against one another. Here the Options, the Options’ Option Focuses, the Options’
associated Considerations, and the Options’ respective Perceived Option Benefit are pictorially
expressed. The Subject would act Self-Beneficially; so, they would select the Option which has
the highest Perceived Option Benefit. This representation allows the reader to easily see what
Consideration is most greatly affecting an Option’s Perceived Option Benefit and which Option
has the highest Perceived Option Benefit.
Only a finite amount of Options and Considerations can fit on this static pictorial
representation. Perhaps an interactive representation would be able to hold more information.
However, these static images will be more than suitable enough for the sake of explaining
Jenny’s motivations and her decision.

Options and Option Focus
Explanation of Options and Option Focus.
An Option is a distinct, potential change of state (a potential Trade) that a person can
select to exchange with their current state. A person chooses the Option that has the greatest
Perceived Benefit to them. Each Option has its own Benefit which is expressed in the Attitude of
its Primary Considerations and its Option Focus. The Primary Considerations will be explained
later in the paper. At any given point there are a near-infinite amount of potential Trades that a
person can take, and thus a near-infinite amount of Options. Asking a person to be aware of all
these Options is non-sensical (a claim corroborated by the theory of Bounded Rationality Ref. 93)
thus the unimaginable amount of Options is mediated by Option Focus. Option Focus is the
direct awareness of an Option and is an absolute value. This awareness can be non-existent,
giving Option Focus a null value, or it is existent (giving Option Focus a positive, non-null,
value that is greater than zero). Option Focus can increase and decrease with the amount of
direct awareness applied onto that Option.
Mathematical Effect of Options and Option Focus.
Option Focus is multiplied by the sum of the Primary Considerations’ Attitude (Total
Option Attitude) resulting in an Option’s Perceived Option Benefit. Therefore, if the Option
Focus has a null value, regardless of what the Total Option Attitude of the Option could be, the
Perceived Option Benefit then has a null value. Each of these possible values of the Option
Focus would affect the selection of the Option. As the assumption holds that people are SelfBeneficial and therefore work towards their greatest Benefit, the Subject would select the Option
with the highest Perceived Option Benefit.
These Mathematical relationships are intended to simulate human responses:
•

•

•

•

•

Where an Option Focus has a null value, it simulates the act of not knowing about
an Option, as any non-null valued Perceived Option Benefit would be selected
over an Option whose Perceived Option Benefit was a null value (null < -∞).
Where an Option has a comparatively lower Option Focus than another, it
simulates not being as aware of an Option in comparison to other Options, even if
the Subject is aware of it to a minor degree (12*1.1 < 12*1.2).
If the Total Option Attitude were significantly higher than the compared Options,
then it would be selected by the Subject even if it had a comparatively lower
Option Focus (60*0.5 > 12*2.4).
As an Option Focus is closer to zero, it would mathematically lower the effect of
both negative and positive Total Option Attitudes (-15*0.2 = -3 and 15 * 0.2 = 3
meanwhile -15*1.2 = -18 and 15*1.2 = 18). This relationship simulates a
person not realizing the significance of an Option’s Benefits (be they positive or
negative) due to their lack of direct awareness placed on that Option.
As an Option Focus get further from zero, it would mathematically increase the
effect of both negative and positive Total Option Attitudes (-12*0.5 > -12*1.2 and

11*0.5 < 11*1.2). This relationship simulates that as a person becomes more
aware of an Option, they tend to emphasize its Beneficial effects, be they positive
or negative.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Options and Option Focus.
Looking back upon the scenario in which Jenny is in, she has obvious Options to ‘Babysit
Kids’ and ‘Stay At Home.’ However, in the near infinite amount of Options which Jenny may
select from, Jenny could choose to ‘Take a Shower.’ What separates the two obvious Options
from this more obscure one is their respective Option Focuses.
The Option to ‘Babysit kids’ as well as the Option to ‘Stay At Home’ both have a much
higher Option Focus than the Option to ‘Take a Shower.’ Mathematically, since the Option
Focus Jenny has for the Option to ‘Take a Shower’ is less than 1 (being 0.54) it would actually
make the Perceived Option Benefit be lower than the Total Option Attitude, if the Total Option
Attitude is positive and does not have a negative value. Meanwhile, if the Total Option Attitude
was negative then a lower Option Focus would make it less negative. In both cases, this
simulates the notion that a person would be less cognizant of the Option’s Benefits and thus the
value of an Option would be underrecognized in both its negative and positive attributes by the
lack of direct awareness placed on the Option.
For Jenny, it means, under this context, that she is more aware of the Option to ‘Babysit
Kids’ and would be more compelled to select it if she has a positive Total Option Attitude
towards that Option. We will derive this value of Total Option Attitude by looking at Jenny’s
Primary Considerations in assessing each of these Options.

Although these three Options are potential changes of state for Jenny’s desires an Option
may be any potential change of state. It may be broad like the changing of an occupation. It may
be granular like changing an arm’s position by moving it two degrees. It can be abstract like a
change in a person’s Understanding. While the Options provided in Jenny’s decision are only
relating to changes of state in her desires, an Option can be any potential change of state.
Primary Considerations
Explanation of Primary Considerations.
Primary Considerations are the main reasons that are Evoked when assessing a potential
Trade (an Option). The Primary Considerations used in evaluating an Option is called an Evoked
Set of Primary Considerations, as the Primary Considerations were Evoked (although Evocation
will be explained later in the paper). Each Primary Consideration has a value ascribed to it in the
form of the Subject’s Attitude towards it. Each Primary Consideration can have a positive or
negative Attitude. An Attitude is the feelings a person has towards a Consideration. A Primary
Consideration’s Attitude is derived from the Primary Consideration’s Evoked Set of MetaConsiderations, these will be explained later in the paper. The Primary Considerations that are
used to assess an Option is called an Evoked Set of Primary Considerations. What Primary
Considerations would be Evoked is unknown. The SBST does not explain how an Evoked Set of
Primary Considerations is created. In its current form, the generation of possible Primary
Considerations requires inferences based on the Option and assumptions on the person.
However, there are also numerous well-trodden concepts and theories that point to possible
sources of Evocation, these will be looked at later on in the paper.
Mathematical Effect of Primary Considerations.
The Total Option Attitude described in the previous section on Options and Option Focus
is the sum of an Option’s Primary Considerations’ Attitudes; that is to say that by adding the
Attitudes of each Primary Consideration in an Option it would result in the Total Option
Attitude. This Total Option Attitude multiplied by the Option Focus will result in the Perceived
Option Benefit, which ultimately determines whether an Option is selected or not.

These Mathematical relationships are intended to simulate human responses:
•

•

•

A Primary Consideration with a positive Attitude would contribute positively towards the
Total Option Attitude. This simulates the Subject recognizing the positively Beneficial
aspects of selecting an Option which would then increase their valuation of that Option.
A Primary Consideration with a negative Attitude would contribute negatively towards
the Total Option Attitude. This simulates the Subject recognizing the negatively
Beneficial aspects of selecting an Option which would then lower their valuation of that
Option.
Any amount of Primary Considerations may be associated with an Option allowing for
many positive and negative Primary Considerations. This simulates the Subject having
any given amount of reasons for selecting (or not selecting) an Option.

Figure 5: Primary Considerations Circled

Figure 5. An image of the Option Comparison Table with the Evoked Set of Primary
Considerations for each of the Options displayed circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Primary Considerations.
For each of the Options that Jenny is faced with in this situation there is a Benefit. We
recognize these Benefits through the Considerations she has for each Option. Primary
Considerations give the reader a view into the main reasons that would influence Jenny’s
decision.
Jenny is a hypothetical person whose memories, motives, and aspirations only exist
within the confines of this thought experiment. Therefore, we cannot know for sure what her
reasons would be for her decision. However, we can make inferences and assumptions based on
her character, what we’ve learned about her from the context provided at the beginning of the
paper, and the Option she is assessing. This aspect of inferring, assuming, and generating
Considerations is explored deeper in the Evocation section of the paper.
The Primary Considerations for each Option reveal Jenny’s main reasons for selecting an
Option. For instance, if Jenny had a greater Attitude towards her schoolwork (which has an
Attitude of -29) then she likely would have chosen to stay at home to complete it. Instead, the
Primary Consideration of doing schoolwork lowered the Total Option Attitude to such an extent
that Jenny would rather babysit kids and procrastinate than do her schoolwork. Likewise, without
the Consideration of the $50 Jenny likely wouldn’t have gone babysitting. Sure, Jenny seems to
care about Kyle from the first Primary Consideration of “Kyle’s Appeal to Character” but not
enough to do it for free, it seems, because without the Consideration of the $50 the Total Option

Attitude of babysitting kids would have been -23 (12-20-15) which is significantly lower than
staying at home and since Jenny, like all people, is Self-Beneficial she would have likely chosen
to stay at home (depending on how the Option Focuses would have affected the Options’
Perceived Option Benefit).
The Attitudes of each of these Primary Considerations can have drastic impacts on a
person’s decision. Recognizing the source of these Attitudes is vital in comprehending a person’s
motivations. The Attitudes of these Primary Considerations come from each of their MetaConsiderations (which in the picture are hiding behind each “…}” symbol of an ellipsis followed
by a curly brace).
Meta-Considerations
Explanation of Meta-Considerations.
Meta-Considerations are the reasonings behind a Primary Consideration and they
describe our reasonings for why we hold a certain Attitude towards a Primary Consideration.
These reasonings should, ultimately, specifically and legibly express each of the Benefits that the
Subject has identified within the Primary Considerations. Meta-Considerations are quite similar
to Primary Considerations as both Meta-Considerations and Primary Considerations are a type
of Consideration, and thus both are Evoked and have a value ascribed to it in the form of the
Subject’s Attitude towards it.
Meta-Considerations, like Primary Considerations, also help make the Benefits
associated with an Option more legible. For example (as shown in Jenny’s situation), the Benefit
of paying off credit card bills seems to have no relevance to babysitting kids…however, with
Considerations, a person can track the Subject’s Considerations and see how paying off credit
card bills relates to babysitting kids. As the Meta-Consideration Titled “Paying off credit card
bills” is one of reasonings behind the valuation of the Primary Consideration Titled “Get $50.”
Without these Meta-Considerations, it would be far more difficult to ensure that all the
Perceived Benefits a Subject has recognized in an Option are being represented.
The Meta-Considerations used in evaluating a Primary Consideration’s Attitude is called
an Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations, as the Meta-Considerations were Evoked (although
Evocation will be explained later in the paper). Each Meta-Consideration has an Attitude which
is described by the sum of the Attitudes held in the Meta-Considerations directly posterior to it in
its set. This recursive process of acquiring value from the directly posterior Considerations
(Considerations to the left of it, in the pictorial representation of the SBST) continues down each
line of Meta-Considerations until the last Meta-Consideration which is always the General
Impressions and this is where the all its anterior Considerations (Considerations to the right of it,
in the pictorial representation of the SBST) ultimately derive their Attitude. General Impressions
will be explained in a later part of the paper. A Primary Consideration may have any amount of
Meta-Considerations (greater than zero, as General Impressions is a necessary MetaConsideration) in reasoning its Attitude. These Meta-Considerations may branch out but there
will always be a General Impressions at the end of each line.

Mathematical Effect of Meta-Considerations.
Mathematically, every Consideration’s Attitude is equal to the Attitude of its directly
posterior Meta-Considerations. A Consideration, independent of General Impressions, has no
value in its Attitude. Although it may seem that the Considerations do not directly affect the
mathematics of the SBST, since it is all derived from the General Impressions, the General
Impressions at the end of each set of Meta-Considerations takes into account its directly anterior
Consideration in how it yields its value. Visually, these mathematical relationships become far
more evident and will become more so once General Impressions has been explained later in the
paper.
These Mathematical relationships are intended to simulate human responses:

•

Meta-Considerations posterior to a Consideration can branch out, allowing for
several different Benefits to be identified for that Consideration. This simulates that
the Subject may have several lines of reasoning behind their Attitude towards a
Consideration, and that the Subject may identify many different Benefits (positive
and/or negative) for a given Consideration.
Each line in an Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations can contain any amount of MetaConsiderations (greater than zero, as General Impressions is always necessary). This
simulates that some lines of reasoning behind an Attitude may be more thought out,
and thus have more underlying reasons, as compared to others with shorter lines of
Meta-Considerations.
The Meta-Considerations branching behind a Consideration can include both positive
and negative Meta-Considerations. This simulates that the reasons that the Subject
has are for an Attitude are not entirely positive nor entirely negative (the Perceived
Benefits for a reason may include positive and negative Perceived Benefits).
A Primary Consideration’s Attitude is equivalent to the sum of all the General
Impressions in its Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations. This is due to the General
Impressions ultimately being the source of value for all its anterior Considerations.
This relationship simulates that a person’s Attitude towards a Consideration
ultimately comes from the Benefits that have been identified for that Consideration.
The value of each Meta-Consideration is passed forward towards its anterior
Consideration, and keeps going forward until being fed into the Primary
Consideration. This relationship means that the Attitudes of the Meta-Considerations
become the source of the Attitude associated with their Primary Consideration. This
simulates the underlying reasons a Subject has for a main reason affect that main
reason (which positively or negatively affects an Option)
If the sum of the General Impressions posterior to a Primary Consideration is equal
to zero, then the Primary Consideration has an Attitude equal to zero. This simulates
the Subject having an equal balance of positive and negative underlying reasons for a
main reason used in assessing an Option, and it thus having a neutral effect on their
evaluation of an Option.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Meta-Considerations.
The Attitudes held in the Primary Considerations from each of her Options are derived
from her Meta-Considerations. Each Primary Consideration has an Evoked Set of MetaConsiderations behind it explaining its Attitude. These Meta-Considerations can be described as
the reasonings behind the main reasons used to assess and Option.
The Meta-Considerations we see in Jenny’s circumstance have been placed based
inferences and assumptions based on her character, what we’ve learned about her from the
context provided at the beginning of the paper, and the Option she is assessing. Although they,
like Primary Considerations, have been Evoked.
Each of the Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations describe the reasoning behind the
Attitude of its associated Primary Consideration. However, we will explore the Evoked Set of
Meta-Considerations behind the most influential Primary Consideration: “Get $50.” This
Primary Consideration had the highest Attitude and is thus the most influential in why the
Option was selected.
So, let’s follow it. In asking why the Attitude of receiving $50 (“Get $50”) has its value,
we find that the reasons would be the trust she has in Kyle to pay her the $50 for babysitting
(“Trust in Kyle to pay $50”) and the value she places on $50 (“Value of $50”). It should be noted

that $50 dollars does not have an objective value among all people; it may be valued by some
higher than others. For Jenny, a high schooler, the value of $50 is quite high.
In asking why the Attitude associated with the value she places on $50 (“Value of $50”)
has its value, we find that the reasons would be her current supply of money (“Current supply of
money”) and her plans to use that money (“Plans to use money”). We see that reasons used in
her valuation of money (“Value of $50”) are rooted in how she can use that money (“Plans to use
money”) and how much money she has (“Current supply of money”) meanwhile other people
may have many other reasons for how they value money. Jenny’s valuation is uniquely her own
and will be explored in the section on Evocation.
In asking why the Attitude of her plans to use the money (“Plans to use money”) has its
value, we find the reasons to be paying off her credit card bills (“Paying off credit card bills”)
and buying a new guitar (“Buying a new guitar”). We see that the Meta-Consideration which has
the Consideration Title of “Paying off credit card bills” has a negative effect on the Attitude she
has towards her plans to use the money (“Plans to use money”). Mathematically we see this in
the sum of their values: 33 (from the Consideration Titled “Buying a new Guitar”) plus -4 (from
the Consideration Titled “Paying off credit card bills”) equals 29 (from the Consideration Titled
“Plans to use money”). Why does Jenny have a negative Attitude towards paying off her credit
card bills (“Paying off credit card bills”)? Perhaps she feels that the money would be better spent
elsewhere, or maybe it’s a reminder of her poor spending habits, whatever the case may be it has
a negative effect that ripples out all the way to the Attitude of the Primary Consideration “Get
$50.”
We will continue looking at the Meta-Consideration with a Consideration Title of
“Buying a new guitar” however when we look at why it has its value, we hit a special kind of
Meta-Consideration called General Impressions. This special kind of Meta-Consideration is the
place where all anterior Considerations receive their Attitude and it will be explained later in the
paper.
Evocation
Explanation of Evocation.
To say that a Consideration is ‘Evoked’ means, in the SBST, that is created by unknown
means. The Considerations each person has in response to an Option may differ wildly. One
could assume that these unique Considerations are due to the differences in a person’s heredity
or their life-experiences. The SBST attempts not to make these assumptions. Rather, it simply
acknowledges that Considerations exist, they have an associated Attitude which is ultimately
derived from General Impressions, they have an associated Consideration Title, and that they are
likely created by some means which it calls ‘Evoking’. The SBST does not explain how an
Evoked Set of Considerations is created. In its current form, the generation of possible
Considerations requires inferences based on the Option and assumptions on the person.
However, there are several well-trodden concepts and theories which point to possible sources of
Evocation.

Possible Sources of Evocation.
The mathematical effects of Evocation have already been expressed in the Primary
Considerations and Meta-Considerations sections of the paper, so it will not be reiterated here.
While the SBST is a nascent idea we can look to past theories, concepts, and practices to see how
they can be used to explain possible sources of a person’s Considerations when comparing
Options. These possible sources of Evocation, in reference to the SBST, aim to recognize and
organize the Subject’s identified Benefits of an Option into specific and legible Considerations.

Techniques for Consumer Segmentation Ref. 11 have been developed for marketers to
establish commonly Evoked Considerations for a segment of their consumer population.
These Consumer Segmentation techniques typically view the sources of Evocation to be
Demographic Ref. 14 factors, Behavioral Ref. 15 factors, Psychographic Ref. 12 factors, and
Geographic Ref. 13 factors.
Need-Based Motivation Theories like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Ref. 57 view the
sources of Evocation to be a person’s needs; that when a person is contemplating whether
to select an Option the Evoked Considerations are going to be in regards to how the
Option helps them satisfy their needs.
Other ideas have been put forth regarding commonly Evoked Considerations for specific
kinds of Options. One of these being the Evoked Considerations for performing jobs as
explained by Hackman and Oldham’s Job Characteristic Model Ref. 34. This Model views
the source of Evocation to be the core characteristics of the job itself. Therefore, each
Option would have Considerations that relate to the core characteristics of that Option.
We may also identify common Considerations, which can be used to generalize a group
of individuals.
o An example of a common Primary Consideration would be found in
Interpersonal Trades. When a Trade has been put forward to a person by another
entity (be it another real-person or a brand) there tends to be an Appeal to
Character Ref. 30 involved in evaluating whether or not the person should select that
Option (as in the case of a brand’s character influencing a person’s decision in
purchasing their products).
o Another common Consideration would be the achievement of previously chosen
goals. If an Option might be effective in achieving a goal or be counterproductive
in achieving a goal, it would be a Consideration used in assessing an Option to
determine whether it should be selected.

Figure 7: Evoked Sets of Meta-Considerations and an Evoked Set of Primary
Considerations

Figure 7. An image of the Option Comparison Table with all the Considerations for the
Option that has an Option Title of “Babysit Kids.” The Primary Considerations of the Option are
called an Evoked Set of Primary Considerations. The Meta-Considerations behind each Primary
Consideration is an Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations. The red braces are meant to show the
organization of an Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations as well as its source (by following the
point on the right side of the curly brace).

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Evocation.
For Jenny’s decision, her Considerations were chosen based on inferences about the
Option and assumptions about her character (which was derived from the context described
earlier in the paper).
However, a person using the SBST may come to different conclusions based on
inferences about the Option presented and assumptions about the character of the Subject. Also,
the person using the SBST may not have the advantage of a detailed description of their Subject.
So, it may be important to identify more formal structures than the current method of Evocation.
Some of these formal structures can be found in the possible sources of Evocation described
earlier and we can apply them to Jenny’s situation.
Using Consumer Segmentation to Generate Jenny’s Considerations.
If we were using Consumer Segmentation Ref. 11 as our source of Evocation we would
look at several variables which differ in relevance as we look the various factors that could affect
Jenny. Many of these variables were not detailed in the context (as they were not needed for the

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade

23

method of Evocation that we used). These variables may be acquired by asking Jenny (or
whomever the Subject is) or by asking some other person (or database) which has the
information.
Demographic Ref. 14 factors use variables like age, life-cycle stage, gender, and income.
Jenny’s age would be that of a high schooler. Her life-cycle stage would be that of a teenager.
Her gender would be female. Her income would be dependent on how often she babysits for
Kyle, the average payment for babysitting, and whether she has any other means of revenue
generation. Then assumptions can be made from the collection of this information. They could
ask what is important to a person of a high schooler’s age; what reasons would they use to assess
an Option? What reasons would a teenager use in the assessment of an Option? How would a
Subject’s gender affect their reasons for selecting an Option? What reasons would a person at
that income level use in the assessment of an Option? The same applies for each of the various
factors: demographic Ref. 14, behavioral Ref. 15, psychographic Ref. 12, and geographic Ref. 13. Since
these questions require information that we (from the context provided earlier) do not have, I will
not pursue these questions (as they would additional information to Jenny’s situation that is not
necessary for the rest of the paper).
The problem with this source of Evocation, as seen in the application to Jenny’s situation
is that Consumer Segmentation is too broad. It was developed to look at segments in the market
not individual people. The SBST looks at an individual person and analyzes their motivations.
Using the variables associated with each of the factors described by consumer segmentation, an
imprecise representation of the Subject can be created but it may be precise enough to be useful.
Using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to generate Jenny’s Considerations.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Ref. 57 gets around this issue of generality by looking at the
individual person and analyzing their needs. In this possible source of Evocation, we can assume
that the five needs described by Maslow’s hierarchy of needs are Jenny’s Primary
Considerations. These needs include: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love
needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs.
Then, we could place Meta-Considerations behind each of these Primary Considerations
to describe the reasonings behind them. For self-actualization needs it may have the MetaConsiderations Titled: “Buying a new guitar”, “Time spent driving.” For esteem needs it may
have the Meta-Consideration Titled: “Get to practice driving.” For belongingness and love needs
it may have the Meta-Considerations Titled: “Kyle is a kind man”, “Kyle respects my time”, and
“Have to entertain kids for the night.” For safety needs it may have the Meta-Considerations
Titled: “Trust in Kyle to pay the $50”, “Cost of gas”, “Current supply of money”, and “Paying
off credit card bills.” Each of these Meta-Considerations would be followed by General
Impressions which passes the Attitude forward to the Primary Considerations. There did not
seem to be any physiological needs as babysitting kids did not seem to have any Considerations
for Jenny that were directly linked to her physical well-being (possibly because she has
adequately satisfied her physical needs).

This possible source of Evocation allows for a highly individualistic analysis of the
Subject, which is advantageous for the SBST. It also provides a formal structure to what kinds of
Considerations could be Evoked. The difficulty with it though, is organizing the MetaConsiderations. Money, for instance, may satisfy any number of a person’s needs. Therefore,
any Consideration that involves money may fall into a physiological need (to purchase food), an
esteem need (to own lots of money), or self-actualization needs (if that purchase helps the
Subject perform creative activities). If this possible source of Evocation were to be used, the
Consideration Titles would have to be far more expressive in describing their Benefits. However,
if a high level of specificity is feasibly reached with the Subject, then this may be a useful source
of Evocation.
Using Option-based methods to generate Jenny’s Considerations.
This approach to Evocation looks at the characteristics of the Option and inputs relevant
Considerations based on those characteristics.
This approach was used in Hackman and Oldham’s Job Characteristic Model Ref. 34 where
the researchers analyzed the characteristics of modern jobs and turn them into critical
psychological states (which can be easily described as Considerations, as they are the Beneficial
effects of the job).
This approach was also used by Dave Mark in his Infinite Axis Utility System Ref. 55 (his
part of this conference begins at 33:35). The SBST and the Infinite Axis Utility System are quite
similar, making this approach easily transferrable into the SBST. The Infinite Axis Utility
System is mainly used in video games to describe the AI of NPC’s. There are also key
differences such as: actions are used in place of Options (which include actions alongside any
other change of state), a lack of Option Focus (all Options have an equal amount of awareness),
it uses a function in place of General Impressions (and all the advantages it provides), and its
Considerations have an associated specific value that fully describes it for use in the function
(like “Enemy health” having an associated float value of 12.5) which is useful in the simulated
environments that the Infinite Axis Utility System is meant to be used but not with human beings
who have difficulty with identifying such specifics about their environment. It’s similarities
though make its approach to generating Considerations for each action transferrable to the
SBST. The Considerations for its actions are pre-decided by the developer of the video game to
describe which Considerations would be relevant for each possible action by recognizing the
characteristics of that action. This approach has proven useful for developing realistic behaviors
for video game characters that are easily comprehended by the video game developers; so, it may
also be useful in evoking Considerations that adequately represent the Subject’s Perceived
Beneficial effects of an Option in a specific and legible manner.
Applying this approach to Jenny’s situation we can see its advantages. It should be noted
that this approach assumes we have more information than given in the context. It also takes into
account some of the assumptions made in the illustration’s method of Evocation and turns them
into prior Options which must be selected (such as having to choose the method of transportation
rather than assuming she would use a car). For Jenny to “babysit kids” it requires that Jenny be
present in close proximity to the kids. Since she is at her home and not in close proximity to the

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade

25

kids, she would have to become in close proximity through traveling which (based on her being a
high schooler) might be via riding the bus, walking or driving. There is no bus pick-up in her
area. So, the choices for transportation would include walking or driving. If she chose to walk,
then the physical safety of the chosen walking area and distance of the walk would be
Considerations. If she chose to drive, it would require that she have a driver’s license and a car
to drive, both of which she has. To drive a car requires skill, time, and fuel, so her skill level in
driving, her time spent driving, and the fuel expenditure would likely be Considerations for
driving. There is a long distance between her neighborhood to Kyle’s home (where the kids
would likely be). Since the distance of the walk would be very long, and is a Consideration for
walking, it would likely make driving more preferable to walking. This assumes that the
Considerations for driving are more positive than that of walking and she has a positive Option
Focus towards driving. Making these assumptions, it can be determined that Jenny would choose
to drive to Kyle’s house and thus the Considerations for driving would be included in her
decision to babysit or not.
That lengthy analysis goes through one single characteristic of the Option (being in close
proximity to the kids for babysitting) there are also other characteristics like payment, time spent
babysitting, kids involved in babysitting, activities performed during babysitting, the
environment that the babysitting is taking place, and the relationship of the person requesting to
babysit. These characteristics are intrinsic to the Option of babysitting and could generate almost
all the Considerations involved in the illustration.
This approach can be very thorough and, with more information, fewer assumptions can
be made. Since this possible source of Evocation is more information-driven than the others it
might be the most reliable, as assumptions are part of each of the previously presented possible
sources of Evocation, but this approach can reduce those assumptions with more information
about the Subject and information that would be relevant to the Subject in making their decision.
The problem with this approach is that it looks at the more at Option rather than the
Subject. It sees what characteristics are intrinsic to the Option presented, then it makes
assumptions based on the person on how they might react to each of these characteristics, then it
generates Considerations that are relevant to those characteristics and what its assumed about the
person. By starting at the Option, rather than the Subject, there are Considerations that might be
missed which the person has that are only tangentially related to the Option. For example, Jenny
wanting to buy a guitar to satisfy her dream of becoming a famous guitarist is relevant to the
Option because the money received for babysitting could be used in buying the guitar but it is so
tangential from the characteristics of the Option that it might be missed by this possible source of
Evocation. The Subject may also not be using every characteristic of the Option in their valuation
of the Option – as the Subject may be ignorant of some of these characteristics and thus cannot
assess the Benefits of unknown characteristics. Also, this possible source of Evocation has the
same issue that is shared by all of the possible sources of Evocation shown in this section, which
is a lack of information. The Option Title “Babysit Kids” only provides so much information,
there may be other factors involved in the Option that are not described in that Option Title. This
is why having a thorough context is important; to better comprehend all the factors and relevant

26

information which the Subject may use to assess the Benefits of the Option. From this
comprehension, the Benefits can be identified and organized into specific and legible
Considerations (which is what all of the possible sources of Evocation have attempted to do).

General Impressions
Explanation of General Impressions.
At the end of a length of Meta-Considerations comes the final Meta-Consideration called
General Impressions. This is where the rationalization of “why” you (representing the Subject)
feel a certain way falls apart and you (representing the Subject) “just feel” that way. At this point
a person may say “I just like it” or they may attempt to rationalize their feelings through a broad
explanation of how someone else might reach that conclusion, although it doesn’t necessarily
pertain to them nor their situation.
An example of this broad explanation would be explaining yourself through evolutionary
biology and how the human body has a tendency to “like” certain things and expresses this
through shots of endorphins. This explanation may describe how another being of the human
race might come to a conclusion by does not necessarily explain why you (as the Subject) feel
that way.
The value of General Impressions is passed into its directly anterior Consideration. This
is repeated for each anterior Consideration (and Considerations’ Attitudes are summed if there is
more than one Consideration posterior to a Consideration) until its value is passed into the
Primary Consideration. One may imagine this as a recursive process whereby the General
Impressions are the value that is passed upwards to the point where the recursive process began:
the Primary Consideration. This means that the sum of the General Impressions behind a
Primary Consideration is equal to the Attitude of the Primary Consideration it is behind.
It should be noted that the point where Considerations end to reach the final MetaConsideration of General Impressions is Subjective. For example, a neuroscientist may have a
long line of Meta-Considerations to justify why he likes drinking alcohol (as the neuroscientist
would recognize many of the Benefits, both positive and negative, that are received from
drinking alcohol). Meanwhile, the casual drunkard may simply like the feeling of being drunk
and after that single Consideration they reach the point of General Impressions (as they do not
recognize any of the Benefits of drinking alcohol besides the sensation of feeling drunk).
The point of General Impressions is one that I do not fully Understand. It is likely a
concoction of illegible chemical reactions in the body which through some means (still
unexplained by neuroscience due to the explanatory gap Ref. 98) form the mind. Perhaps it
describes some spiritual feeling that originates beyond the body. Perhaps it is a form of will. I do
not know and nor does the SBST, in its current form, profess to know. So, instead, I (as the
developer of the SBST) have used a substitute, based on Social Exchange Theory Ref. 97, to
explain the impact of General Impressions. This substitute is the Three Benefits.

Figure 8: General Impressions Circled

Figure 8. An image of the General Impressions of the Option Titled “Babysit Kids”
circled in red. Each of these General Impressions gain their value from the substitute called the
Three Benefits.

Three Benefits
The Three Benefits, as stated earlier, is a substitute for General Impressions. Thus, the
Three Benefits is used in each place that General Impressions would be used. The Three Benefits
assesses the Consideration that is directly anterior of it in how it yields its value. The Three
Benefits are comprised of 3 types of Benefits, which are differentiated by when the Benefit is
received, and they are as follows: Immediate Benefits (Benefits received in a short period of
time), Forecasted Benefits (Benefits received in the future), and Cumulative Benefits (Benefits
that were received in the past). The sum of all 3 Benefits is the value of the Three Benefits which,
as a substitute for General Impressions, is passed into the Attitude of the General Impressions
that it is substituting.
Each of these Benefits are quite similar to one another, so the paper will go into detail
about the Immediate Benefits and then describe the differences found in the Forecasted Benefits
and Cumulative Benefits – in their respective sections.
Immediate Benefits.
The Immediate Benefits are Benefits that are received in a short time period from the
present. The Immediate Benefits is comprised of 5 main components:

Immediate Rewards
Immediate Costs
Innate Aspects
Trade History

Another important value of Immediate Benefits is the Perceived Immediate Value which is equal
to the Immediate Rewards minus the Immediate Ambiguity minus the Immediate Costs
(Perceived Immediate Value = Immediate Rewards – Immediate Ambiguity – Immediate Costs).
This distinction is made for the user of the SBST to observe how the Subject evaluates the
Immediate Benefits of the directly anterior Consideration purely based on their
Opinions/Understanding of it.
The Perceived Immediate Value is multiplied by the Innate Aspects and Trade History resulting
in the Immediate Benefit (Immediate Benefit = Perceived Immediate Value * Innate Aspects *
Trade History). This value includes their Innate Aspects and Trade History which are easily
susceptible to change, as more Trades occur, time between Trades elapses, or the Subject’s
Innate Aspects are altered.
Each of these components are fundamental to the SBST, so any changes (by increasing or
decreasing its value) can have significant effects on the selection of an Option. By increasing or
decreasing any of these components it would affect the valuation of the Immediate Benefit,
which would affect the valuation of the Three Benefits, which would affect the valuation of the
Primary Consideration, which would ultimately affect the valuation of the Option. For the sake
of brevity, this mathematical significance will not be reiterated for each component in their
mathematical effects.

Immediate Ambiguity.
A Consideration’s Immediate Ambiguity is described as the Perceived lack of
Opinions/Understanding towards the Benefits (which are expected to be received within a short
period of time) of a Consideration.
If a person feels as though they don’t have a thorough or complete
Opinions/Understanding of a Consideration’s Benefit within a short period of time, then this is a
form of Immediate Ambiguity. Having Immediate Ambiguity lowers the value of a
Consideration’s Immediate Benefits. However, one method that reduces a Consideration’s
Immediate Ambiguity is via the Subject using their limited Opinions/Understanding to fill in their
Perceived lack of their Opinions/Understanding- which could be seen as a form of data
interpolation or extrapolation based on their Opinions/Understanding and the nature of their
Immediate Ambiguity.
•

Mathematical Effect of Immediate Ambiguity.
Immediate Ambiguity may be lowered. This simulates a person satisfying their
apprehension towards a Consideration, either by expanding their
Opinions/Understanding to encompass that which they Perceived as being lacking or
they come to the Perception that they do not lack Opinions/Understanding through some
other means (like being convinced that they already have full awareness and do not lack

Opinions/Understanding, or the process described above regarding interpolation and
extrapolation).
Immediate Ambiguity is not rigid, it can both decrease and increase. A person’s Perceived
lack of Opinions/Understanding is a state, a state which can be changed voluntarily (and
thus trackable through the SBST) or involuntary (perhaps through a head injury).
Recognizing the flexibility of Immediate Ambiguity simulates the flexible nature of
human Perceptions.
Immediate Ambiguity decreases the Perceived Immediate Value of a Consideration. This
is an assumption that a person who Perceives that they have a lack of
Opinions/Understanding towards a Consideration will view this lack as negative and it
will act to disincentivize them from selecting the Consideration’s associated Option.
o A potentially proposed source of conflicting evidence on this matter would be the
actions of adventurous thrill-seekers. These people seem to desire situations that they
have a Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding. The thrill-seeker jumps off a plane
Ref. 48
(with a parachute) not knowing whether it will be their last jump. In cases like
this, there is the Perception of the unknown. The SBST would acknowledge these
individuals’ decisions by stating that they do it in spite of the unknown; not because
of it.
o The thrill-seeker may have the Understanding that they will receive an adrenaline
rush from jumping off the plane and they have a positive Opinion of excitement
towards that Understanding. The thrill-seeker may also have an Understanding that
the adrenaline rush from jumping off a plane is a uniquely gratifying experience and
they have a positive Opinion of pride and excitement towards their Understanding.
These Opinions/Understandings, to the thrill-seeker, would act as Rewards which
incentivize the behavior. Meanwhile, they also Understand that there is a slim chance
that they could be killed in the jump, they would have a Perceived lack of
Understanding towards this as they do not know for sure if they will die or not. This
Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding from the possibility of death acts as a
source of Ambiguity. However, the thrill-seeker still jumps off the plane because the
positive Benefits from the Rewards are greater than the negative impact of the
Ambiguity.
o Potential sources of corroborating evidence may be found in the numerous occasions
of people who treat Ambiguity as a negative component in their decision-making
process. Primarily, this is seen in people fearing the unknown (fear, generally, being a
negative emotion that disincentivizes behavior). This can be seen cases ranging from
tribalistic xenophobia Ref. 99 to the fear of buying a house Ref. 46. In both cases, it is not
that the person is omniscient and fully justified in their fear, rather it is that they
Perceive that they lack Understanding and thus they have a lack of
Opinions/Understanding.
o This lack of Opinions/Understanding, as shown above, acts as a disincentive in the
decision-making process and so Ambiguity is treated as negative. Whether these
refutations of conflicting evidence and offering of corroborating evidence is enough
to convince the reader, the SBST still makes this assumption.

Figure 10: Immediate Ambiguity Circled

Figure 10. An image of the Immediate Ambiguity for the Benefits of the Consideration
Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Immediate Ambiguity.
Since Jenny will only be buying the guitar in the future, i.e. after she has gotten the
money from Kyle and whenever she has time to make the purchase, the Benefits of this
Consideration would be mainly received in the future.
However, Jenny may have a Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding towards whether
she should be putting money aside for a new guitar right now. Since Jenny has never owned a
guitar (as shown in the context) she may recognize that she does not have a complete
Understanding of the difference between a new guitar and a pre-owned guitar. In the short-term,
Jenny could change this plan of putting aside money for a new guitar to a pre-owned guitar or
some other purchase. So, in the Immediate sense, this Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding
creates Ambiguity for the Consideration of “Buying a new guitar.” Her Ambiguity reduces the
Immediate Benefit of this Consideration.
Immediate Rewards.
A Consideration’s Immediate Rewards is described as a Consideration’s Perceived
positive Benefits received in a short period of time. These Perceived positive Benefits are derived
from what the Subject Understands about a Consideration and how they feel about what they
Understand (their Opinions/Understanding towards a Consideration).

In other words, if a Subject deems (based on what they Understand about a
Consideration and how they feel about that Understanding) a Consideration to be positively
Beneficial to them within a short period of time, then this is a form of an Immediate Reward.
Mathematical Effect of Immediate Rewards.
• Immediate Rewards increase the value of a Consideration’s Immediate Benefits.
• Changing a Subject’s Understanding towards a Consideration can lower or increase
the Immediate Rewards of that Consideration
• Changing a Subject’s Opinion towards a Consideration, can lower or increase the
Immediate Rewards of that Consideration

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Immediate Rewards.
Although the purchase of the guitar would happen in the future, Jenny might be
Rewarded in the short-term by the achievement of her goal. She decided to put aside money for a
new guitar, and she has taken steps to achieve this by babysitting for Kyle. Jenny would
Understand that, as a consequence of babysitting, she would have more money to set aside for
buying her first guitar and she would have a positive Opinion towards this Understanding
(perhaps feeling satisfaction or pride). Her sense of achievement would be Rewarding in the
Immediate sense. This Immediate Reward would increase the Immediate Benefit of this
Consideration.

Immediate Costs.
A Consideration’s Immediate Rewards is described as a Consideration’s Perceived
negative Benefits received in a short period of time. These Perceived negative Benefits are
derived from what the Subject Understands about a Consideration and how they feel about what
they Understand (their Opinions/Understanding towards a Consideration).
In other words, if a Subject deems (based on what they Understand about a
Consideration and how they feel about that Understanding) a Consideration to be negatively
Beneficial to them within a short period of time, then this is a form of an Immediate Cost.
Mathematical Effect of Immediate Costs.
• Immediate Costs decrease the value of a Consideration’s Immediate Benefits.
• Changing a Subject’s Understanding towards a Consideration can lower or increase
the Immediate Costs of that Consideration
• Changing a Subject’s Opinion towards a Consideration can lower or increase the
Immediate Costs of that Consideration
Figure 12: Immediate Costs Circled

Figure 12. An image of the Immediate Costs for the Benefits of the Consideration Titled

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Immediate Costs.
The main Immediate Cost of putting money aside for this new guitar is that the money
cannot be used for anything else. Jenny would Understand that putting more money aside for this
new guitar means that she cannot use the money for anything else she might want to buy; Jenny

would have a negative Opinion towards this Understanding (perhaps feeling frustration). This
Immediate Cost would decrease the Immediate Benefit of this Consideration.
The Perceived Immediate Value may still be positive if the Immediate Reward Jenny has
is greater than the Immediate Cost and the Immediate Ambiguity. So, if her sense of achievement
in putting aside the money for buying herself a new guitar is greater than the limitation on her
purchasing power and her Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding on “Buying a new guitar,”
then the Perceived Immediate Value would be positive. Which, in this case, it is not. The
Immediate Costs and Ambiguity she has for this Consideration outweigh the Immediate Rewards.
So, the Perceived Immediate Value for this Consideration is negative.
Innate Aspects: Impulsiveness.
An Innate Aspect is described as the fluctuating inclinations of a person caused by their
internal factors, such as a person’s mental capabilities and their dispositions. Innate Aspects of
the Immediate Benefit differ from the Forecasted Benefits and Cumulative Benefits in their most
influential Innate Aspect involved in Modifying the valuation of their respective Benefit. The
most influential Innate Aspect for Immediate Benefit is Impulsiveness.
Impulsiveness is described as a person’s inclination of being swayed by short-term gains
and losses. If a person is currently feeling Impulsive, then they would be more swayed by a
Consideration’s Perceived Immediate Value than a person who is less Impulsive. The Innate
Aspects of Immediate Benefits, (predominantly Impulsiveness) is multiplied by the Perceived
Immediate Value to become a Modifier of the Perceived Immediate Value (Immediate Benefit’s
Innate Aspects * Perceived Immediate Value). The Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspects can either
increase or decrease the value of a Consideration’s Immediate Benefits.
•

This depends on how high or low a person’s Innate Aspects of Immediate Benefits
are, though it is predominantly influenced by a person’s Impulsiveness, as well as
whether the Perceived Immediate Value is positive or negative.

Innate Aspects, like Impulsiveness, have probable sources. In the SBST’s definition of
Innate Aspects it stated that they are caused by a person’s internal factors, such as their mental
capabilities and their dispositions. Thus we may assume causality between a person’s mental
capabilities affect a person’s Impulsiveness (as we see with Lobotomies causing some patients to
become Impulsive Ref. 100) we may also assume that a person’s dispositions affect their
Impulsiveness (as we see in the many causes of Impulsiveness relating to biological Ref. 21 and
emotional Ref. 8 dispositions). However, the exact manner in which these internal factors affect
Innate Aspects (like Impulsiveness) is not explained by the SBST. Rather the SBST simply
acknowledges the relationship Innate Aspects has with a Subject’s internal factors.
Mathematical Effect of Innate Aspects.
• The Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspects are multiplied by the Perceived Immediate
Value.
• The Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspects can increase, decrease, or have no effect on
the Perceived Immediate Value

As Impulsiveness increases, the Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspects should increase
As Impulsiveness decreases, the Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspects should decrease

Figure 13: Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspect Circled

Figure 13. An image of the Immediate Benefit’s Innate Aspects for the Benefits of the
Consideration Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Innate Aspects.
Innate Aspects, as described in its definition, are caused by the Subject’s internal factors,
such as their mental capabilities and their dispositions. Since Jenny is a high-school-aged
teenager, her mental capabilities are limited based on her brain’s development Ref. 82 in ways that
make her predisposed to have some Impulsiveness.
Having this predisposition towards Impulsiveness makes the Innate Aspect associated
with the Immediate Benefits have an effect that increases the significance of the Immediate
Benefit’s value (more negative if the Perceived Immediate Value was negative and more positive
if the Perceived Immediate Value was positive).
Jenny’s predisposition towards having Impulsiveness made her give greater value to the
Immediate Benefits (both positive and negative). The Reward of achievement, the Ambiguity of
not knowing enough about new guitars, and the Cost of limited buying power have increased
significance to Jenny due to her Impulsiveness. However, since Jenny had a negative Perceived
Immediate Value, her predisposition in having Impulsiveness negatively affected the value of the
Immediate Benefit.

Immediate Benefit’s Trade History.
Trade History is a descriptor of past Trades, predominantly describing the recency and
frequency of a Consideration’s involvement in Trades and whether those Trades were a success
(it was in an Option that was selected) or whether they were a failure (it was in an Option with a
high Option Focus that was not selected). The SBST states that the Immediate Benefit’s Trade
History is a Modifier that is multiplied by the value derived from the Perceived Immediate Value
multiplied by the Immediate Benefits’ Innate Aspects; the same applies for the Forecasted
Benefits and the Cumulative Benefits with their respective components.
A Trade’s recency refers to how recently a Trade involving a Consideration was a
success or how recently a Trade involving a Consideration failed.
A Trade’s frequency refers to how frequently a Trade involving a Consideration was a
success or how frequently a Trade involving a Consideration failed.
An example of a Trade’s recency affecting a Trade would be the Trade History of the
Consideration Titled “sugary sweetness” (a Consideration that a person is likely to use in the
selection of Options regarding candy and deserts). A person may have heaps of sugary ice-cream
and lose interest in it as they continue to eat. The person’s lack of enthusiasm would be shared
for eating sugary chocolates. Even though the (hypothetical) person has not eaten chocolate for
quite some time. However, since the person recently had a past Trade which involved the
Consideration of “sugary sweetness.” In this contrived example, the past recent Trade of eating
sugary ice-cream would lower the value of eating sugary chocolates in the near future. Although
this example is contrived, and the person does not exist (as is common among thought
experiments), the notion of a taste lowering in pungency is well recognized by the concept of
sensory adaptation Ref. 42.
The SBST, in its current form, does not explore the specifics of Trade History. Certain
Trade Histories may work better for a particular Consideration while it may not work for others,
as seen in this article Ref. 71 which notes the difference in times required to form a habit based on
the varying in effort of the tasks. Regardless, the proposed relationship of Trade History to a
Consideration’s Benefits is still valid and is also recognized in the RFM Ref. 80, a marketing tool
which is used to predict a customer’s behaviors.
Beyond the relationship, the SBST does not specifically state how recency and frequency
affect the valuation of Trade History. For example, a high frequency may be habit-forming (and
thus raise the value), or monotonously tedious (and thus lower the value). Instead, the SBST
recognizes its importance in the decision-making process and its relationship to other
components of the decision-making process. The SBST also does not make any distinction (in
how the Trade History derives its value) between the Trade History used in Immediate Benefits
to the Trade History used in Forecasted Benefits or Cumulative Benefits but recognizes their
individuality.

Mathematical Effect of Trade History.
• Depending on the value derived from the (Perceived Immediate Value * Immediate
Benefit’s Innate Aspects) and the nature of the Immediate Trade History, it can either
increase or decrease the value of a Consideration’s Immediate Benefits.
• Although the exact effects of recency and frequency on the valuation of Trade
History is vague (as a high value in either can increase or decrease the value of Trade
History) affecting them will have an effect on the valuation of Trade History, and
thus an effect on the Immediate Benefits.
Figure 14: Immediate Benefit’s Trade History Circled

Figure 14. An image of the Immediate Benefit’s Trade History for the Benefits of the
Consideration Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Trade History.
The Consideration of “Buying a new guitar”, is likely a Consideration that Jenny has
been used frequently since she has been saving up for it for such a long time (as shown in the
context). This high frequency of the Consideration’s involvement in previously selected Trades
would affect the Trade History she has associated with the Consideration.
The SBST, in its current state, does not describe how specific Trade Histories affect the
value of Trade History. So, by the high frequency of success of this Consideration, Jenny may
feel desensitized to the idea of saving up for the guitar (lowering the value of the Trade History,
and lowering the significance of the Immediate Benefits) or she might have become habituated to

38

the idea of saving up for a guitar and grown pleasantly accustomed to doing it (increasing the
value of the Trade History, and thus increasing the significance of the Immediate Benefits).
Since Jenny’s dream is to become a famous guitarist, we can assume that she has become
habituated to the idea of buying a new guitar, and thus increased the value of Trade History.
Also, the SBST makes no distinction for how the Trade History of Immediate Benefits is
calculated as compared to the Trade History of the Forecasted Benefits or of the Cumulative
Benefits; so, they would have the same reasons as the ones described here for how they derived
their value; making all of them have the same value as each other.
Forecasted Benefits.
The Forecasted Benefits are Benefits received in the future. The Forecasted Benefits is
comprised of 5 main components:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Forecasted Ambiguity
Forecasted Rewards
Forecasted Costs
Innate Aspects
Trade History

Another important value of Forecasted Benefits is the Perceived Forecasted Value which
is equal to the Forecasted Rewards minus the Forecasted Ambiguity minus the Forecasted Costs
(Perceived Forecasted Value = Forecasted Rewards – Forecasted Ambiguity – Forecasted
Costs). This distinction is made for the user of the SBST to observe how the Subject evaluates
the Forecasted Benefits of the directly anterior Consideration purely based on their
Opinions/Understanding of it.
The Perceived Forecasted Value is multiplied by the Innate Aspects and Trade History
resulting in the Forecasted Benefit (Forecasted Benefit = Perceived Forecasted Value * Innate
Aspects * Trade History). This value includes their Innate Aspects and Trade History which are
easily susceptible to change, as more Trades occur, time between Trades elapses, or the
Subject’s Innate Aspects are altered.
Each of these components are fundamental to the SBST, so any changes (by increasing or
decreasing its value) can have significant effects on the selection of an Option. By increasing or
decreasing any of these components it would affect the valuation of the Forecasted Benefit,
which would affect the valuation of the Three Benefits, which would affect the valuation of the
Primary Consideration, which would ultimately affect the valuation of the Option. For the sake
of brevity, this mathematical significance will not be reiterated for each component in their
mathematical effects.

Forecasted Ambiguity.
A Consideration’s Forecasted Ambiguity is the same as the Immediate Benefits and is
still derived from the Subject’s Opinions/Understanding. The only difference is that it is now
assessing the Perceived Benefits received in the future (rather than the short-term Benefits).
•

Mathematical Effect of Forecasted Ambiguity.
Forecasted Ambiguity may be lowered. This simulates a person satisfying their
apprehension towards a Consideration, either by expanding their
Opinions/Understanding to encompass that which they Perceived as being lacking or
they come to the Perception that they do not lack Opinions/Understanding through
some other means (like being convinced that they already have full awareness and do
not lack Opinions/Understanding, or the process described in Immediate Ambiguity
regarding interpolation and extrapolation).
Forecasted Ambiguity is not rigid, it can both decrease and increase. A person’s
Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding is a state, a state which can be changed
voluntarily (and thus trackable through the SBST) or involuntary (perhaps through a
head injury). Recognizing the flexibility of Forecasted Ambiguity simulates the
flexible nature of human Perceptions.
Forecasted Ambiguity decreases the Perceived Forecasted Value of a Consideration.

Opinions/Understanding towards a Consideration will view this lack as negative and
it will act to disincentivize them from selecting the Consideration’s associated
Option.
Figure 16: Forecasted Ambiguity Circled

Figure 16. An image of the Forecasted Ambiguity for the Benefits of the Consideration
Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Forecasted Ambiguity.
Since Jenny actually buying the guitar would take place in the future, that is where the
majority of the positive and negative Benefits would be received. Also, it being the future, there
is more possibilities and thus more room for unsurety.
Jenny may have lots of Ambiguity as she has a significant Perceived lack of
Opinions/Understanding. She does not have an Understanding of the quality of the guitar that
she will purchase. She does not have a clear Understanding for how long it will take her to
practice before she becomes a skilled guitarist – or whether she would ever become a skilled
guitarist. She does not have a clear Understanding for how often she will be able to play the
guitar, or if her time would be taken up with school or some other activity.
The future is a place where clear Understanding is much rarer, as compared to the past
and the Immediate sense. For Jenny, this Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding regarding
Benefits received in the future creates a high amount of Forecasted Ambiguity.

Forecasted Rewards.
A Consideration’s Forecasted Rewards is the same as the Immediate Benefits and is still
derived from the Subject’s Opinions/Understanding. The only difference is that it is now
assessing the Perceived positive Benefits received in the future.
•
•
•

Mathematical Effect of Forecasted Rewards.
Forecasted Rewards increase the value of a Consideration’s Forecasted Benefits.
By changing a Subject’s Understanding towards a Consideration, it can lower or
increase the Forecasted Rewards of that Consideration
By changing a Subject’s Opinion towards a Consideration can lower or increase the
Forecasted Rewards of that Consideration

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Forecasted Rewards.
For Jenny, buying a guitar has tremendous Rewards. Jenny would Understand that
buying a guitar makes her part of a musical community and she would have a positive Opinion
towards this Understanding (perhaps feeling comfort or a sense of belonging). Jenny would
Understand that buying a guitar gives her access to the guitar to practice whenever she has the
time to practice and she would have a positive Opinion towards this Understanding (perhaps
feeling eager). Among positive Benefits received further in the future, Jenny would Understand
that buying the guitar takes her closer to achieving her dream of becoming a famous guitarist and

would have a positive Opinion towards this Understanding (perhaps satisfaction and
exhilaration). Even further in the future, would be the Benefits received from actually being a
famous guitarist as she Understands that buying this guitar leads to her reaching that point. So,
among all the previously stated positive Benefits would be the various Understandings Jenny has
associated with being a famous guitarist (being loved by fans, meeting celebrities, going on tour,
owning a seaside mansion, etc.) all of which she has positive Opinion towards.
For Jenny, buying a guitar leads to many Rewards from becoming part of the community
to owning a seaside mansion as a result of her fame. All of this culminates in a Forecasted
Reward that is very high.
Forecasted Costs.
A Consideration’s Forecasted Ambiguity is the same as the Immediate Benefits and is
still derived from the Subject’s Opinions/Understanding. The only difference is that it is now
assessing the Perceived negative Benefits received in the future.
Mathematical Effect of Forecasted Costs.
• Forecasted Costs decrease the value of a Consideration’s Forecasted Benefits.
• Changing a Subject’s Understanding towards a Consideration can lower or increase
the Forecasted Costs of that Consideration
• Changing a Subject’s Opinion towards a Consideration can lower or increase the
Forecasted Costs of that Consideration

Figure 18: Forecasted Costs Circled

Figure 18. An image of the Forecasted Costs for the Benefits of the Consideration Titled
“Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Forecasted Costs.
Although Jenny has many Forecasted Rewards associated with buying a new guitar there
are also many negatively Perceived Benefits that would be received in the future.
Of course, there would be the purchase of the new guitar which would drain her bank
account substantially of funds which she would view negatively (perhaps with a sense of
reluctance). There is also the time commitment of practicing, which could take up time that she
would want to use for other things, she would view this Understanding negatively; perhaps with
a sense of dismay. Then, as a famous guitarist, she has the Understanding that she would have to
abandon her family and friends, to a degree, when she is on tour and with her celebrity friends
and would have a negative Attitude towards this perhaps seeing this abandonment as immoral.
Jenny has grandiose ideas for her life as a famous guitarist, and perhaps her
Understandings are not entirely grounded in reality but such is the nature of her Perception of
this far-off dream. Her Understanding is her own (regardless of its accuracy) and from this
Understanding and the Opinions she has towards them, Jenny recognizes (from her Perception)
the many Costs that would come along with the Rewards she would receive in the future by
buying herself a new guitar.

However, to Jenny these Perceived Costs and Ambiguity she has are outweighed by the
marvelous Rewards she will receive in the future by buying a new guitar. This means that the
Perceived Forecasted Value of the Forecasted Benefits of this Consideration is positive.
Innate Aspects: Prudence.
An Innate Aspect is described as the fluctuating inclinations of a person caused by their
internal factors, such as a person’s mental capabilities and their dispositions. Innate Aspects of
the Forecasted Benefit differ from the Immediate Benefits and Cumulative Benefits in their most
influential Innate Aspect involved in Modifying the valuation of their respective Benefit. The
most influential Innate Aspect for Forecasted Benefit is Prudence.
Prudence is described as a person’s inclination of being swayed by future gains and
losses. If a person is currently feeling Prudent, then they would be more swayed by a
Consideration’s Perceived Forecasted Rewards than a person who is less Prudent. The Innate
Aspects of Forecasted Benefits, (predominantly Prudence) is multiplied by the Perceived
Forecasted Value to become a Modifier of the Perceived Forecasted Value (Forecasted Benefit’s
Innate Aspects * Perceived Forecasted Value). The Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects can
either increase or decrease the value of a Consideration’s Forecasted Benefits.
•

This depends on how high or low a person’s Innate Aspects of Forecasted Benefits
are, though it is predominantly influenced by a person’s Prudence, as well as whether
the Perceived Forecasted Value is positive or negative.

The exact manner in which internal factors affect Innate Aspects (like Prudence) is not
explained by the SBST. Rather the SBST simply acknowledges the relationship Innate Aspects
has with a Subject’s internal factors.
Mathematical Effect of Innate Aspects.
• The Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects are multiplied by the Perceived Forecasted
Value.
• The Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects can increase, decrease, or have no effect on
the Perceived Forecasted Value
• As Prudence increases, the Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects should increase
• As Prudence decreases, the Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects should decrease

Figure 19: Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects Circled

Figure 19. An image of the Forecasted Benefit’s Innate Aspects for the Benefits of the
Consideration Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Innate Aspects.
Jenny, in her dedication to her dream, has become quite Prudent. The Benefits received
from becoming a famous guitarist and owning a new guitar are in the future; yet she values these
Benefits highly.
Although Jenny is a teenager who is predisposed to Impulsive tendencies she is still
capable of planning for the future and evaluating the positive and negative Benefits that can be
found in the future by following a plan (even if that Prudence does not come as easily as her
Impulsiveness).
From Jenny’s drive, dedication, and foresight she has gained a relatively high level of
Prudence. The Reward of celebrityhood, the Ambiguity of the quality of the guitar, and the Cost
of using her money to buy the guitar (as well as all the other Perceived Benefits she will receive
in the future and the Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding she has towards Benefits she will
receive in the future) have increased significance to Jenny due to her Prudence. Since Jenny had
a positive Perceived Forecasted Value, her Prudence positively affected the value of the
Forecasted Benefit.

Forecasted Benefit’s Trade History.
Trade History is the same for all Three Benefits. Although their individuality is
recognized, there is no difference (at present) in how Trade History is calculated for the different
types of Benefits.

•

Mathematical Effect of Trade History.
Depending on the value derived from the (Perceived Forecasted Value * Forecasted
Benefit’s Innate Aspects) and the nature of the Forecasted Benefit’s Trade History, it can
either increase or decrease the value of a Consideration’s Forecasted Benefits.
Although the exact effects of recency and frequency on the valuation of Trade History is
vague (as a high value in either can increase or decrease the value of Trade History)
affecting them will have an effect on the valuation of Trade History, and thus an effect on
the Forecasted Benefits.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Trade History.
Since there is no difference in how the Trade History is calculated between the
Immediate, Forecasted, and Cumulative Benefits, they would each have the same reasonings and
explanation. Rather than repeating it here, the valuation of Trade History is explained in the
Immediate Benefits and would have the same effect on the Forecasted Benefits.

The only difference is that the value of Trade History is being multiplied by the value
derived from the Perceived Forecasted Value multiplied by the Forecasted Benefit’s Innate
Aspects.
Cumulative Benefits.
The Cumulative Benefits are Benefits that have been accumulated from the past. The
Cumulative Benefits is comprised of 5 main components:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Cumulative Ambiguity
Cumulative Rewards
Cumulative Costs
Innate Aspects
Trade History

Another important value of Immediate Benefits is the Perceived Cumulative Value which
is equal to the Cumulative Rewards minus the Cumulative Ambiguity minus the Cumulative
Costs (Perceived Cumulative Value = Cumulative Rewards – Cumulative Ambiguity –
Cumulative Costs). This distinction is made for the user of the SBST to observe how the Subject
evaluates the Cumulative Benefits of the directly anterior Consideration purely based on their
Opinions/Understanding of it.
The Perceived Cumulative Value is multiplied by the Innate Aspects and Trade History
resulting in the Cumulative Benefit (Cumulative Benefit = Perceived Cumulative Value * Innate
Aspects * Trade History). This value includes their Innate Aspects and Trade History which are
easily susceptible to change, as more Trades occur, time between Trades elapses, or the
Subject’s Innate Aspects are altered.
Each of these components are fundamental to the SBST, so any changes (by increasing or
decreasing its value) can have significant effects on the selection of an Option. By increasing or
decreasing any of these components it would affect the valuation of the Cumulative Benefit,
which would affect the valuation of the Three Benefits, which would affect the valuation of the
Primary Consideration, which would ultimately affect the valuation of the Option. For the sake
of brevity, this mathematical significance will not be reiterated for each component in their
mathematical effects.

Benefits of the Consideration Titled “Buying a new guitar”.

Cumulative Ambiguity.
A Consideration’s Cumulative Ambiguity is the same as the Immediate Benefits and is
still derived from the Subject’s Opinions/Understanding. The only difference is that it is now
assessing the accumulated Benefits of the Consideration (rather than the short-term Benefits).
It should be noted that a Subject may still have Ambiguity for Benefits received in the past
(i.e. that have been accumulated). Even though they happened in the past, the Benefits received
may be called into question. An example of this is shown in this article Ref. 53, which goes on to
ask whether salt is actually harmful to the human body. The Perceived Benefits (positive and
negative) that salt provides to people is primarily relating to its flavor, and this article calls that
into question. The article raises the possibility that other Benefits were also being received as the
reader of this article was eating salt, thus creating Ambiguity for the Benefits received in the past
from eating salt as well as foods that have the Consideration of “saltiness”.
Mathematical Effect of Cumulative Ambiguity.
• Cumulative Ambiguity may be lowered. This simulates a person satisfying their
apprehension towards a Consideration, either by expanding their
Opinions/Understanding to encompass that which they Perceived as being lacking or
they come to the Perception that they do not lack Opinions/Understanding through
some other means (like being convinced that they already have full awareness and do

not lack Opinions/Understanding, or the process described in Immediate Ambiguity
regarding interpolation and extrapolation).
Cumulative Ambiguity is not rigid, it can both decrease and increase. A person’s
Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding is a state, a state which can be changed
voluntarily (and thus trackable through the SBST) or involuntary (perhaps through a
head injury). Recognizing the flexibility of Cumulative Ambiguity simulates the
flexible nature of human Perceptions.
Cumulative Ambiguity decreases the Perceived Cumulative Value of a Consideration.
This is an assumption that a person who Perceives that they have a lack of
Opinions/Understanding towards a Consideration will view this lack as negative and
it will act to disincentivize them from selecting the Consideration’s associated an
Option.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Cumulative Ambiguity.
Jenny would have little to be Ambiguous about, regarding Benefits from the past. Yet there may
still be a Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding about those who dissuaded her from her
dream and told her their disconcerting thoughts about being a guitarist. While Jenny is quite
resolute in her dream, she has a Perceived lack of Opinions towards this Understanding. She
does not know how to feel about those who tried to dissuade her. Should she feel grateful for
their attempts to help her? Should she feel irritated at their lack of faith in her to become a

famous guitarist? For Jenny, how she should feel is unclear. From this Perceived lack of
Opinions, there is a Perceived lack of Opinions/Understanding.
Cumulative Rewards.
A Consideration’s Cumulative Rewards is the same as the Immediate Benefits and is still
derived from the Subject’s Opinions/Understanding. The only difference is that it is now
assessing Perceived positive Benefits received in the past.
Mathematical Effect of Cumulative Rewards.
• Cumulative Rewards increase the value of a Consideration’s Cumulative Benefits.
• By changing a Subject’s Understanding towards a Consideration, it can lower or
increase the Cumulative Rewards of that Consideration
• By changing a Subject’s Opinion towards a Consideration can lower or increase the
Cumulative Rewards of that Consideration

Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Cumulative Rewards.
Although she has not yet bought the guitar, it has still yielded positive Benefits. These
positive Benefits come from the achievement she has felt in the past from saving up for the guitar
(perhaps feeling a sense of satisfaction or pride towards this Understanding) and the positive
thoughts she’s had when thinking about what life will be like after she has bought the new guitar
(perhaps feeling a sense of nostalgia and delight from this Understanding). Jenny may have also

her excitement. She views these previously received Benefits as positive, and thus they are

still derived from the Subject’s Opinions/Understanding. The only difference is that it is now

Mathematical Effect of Cumulative Costs.
Cumulative Costs decrease the value of a Consideration’s Cumulative Benefits.
Changing a Subject’s Understanding towards a Consideration can lower or increase
the Cumulative Costs of that Consideration
Changing a Subject’s Opinion towards a Consideration can lower or increase the
Cumulative Costs of that Consideration

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Cumulative Costs.
While Jenny has had many Cumulative Rewards in discussing and thinking about buying
a new guitar, there may have also been Costs. Her friends may have been encouraging but not
everyone she shared her dream with had the same enthusiasm (as shown in the context at the
beginning of the paper). Perhaps others tried to dissuade her and rebuked her for her lofty dream.

Jenny may have also had thoughts that were negative about buying a new guitar, like how
difficult it would be to learn the guitar and having to leave her friends and family behind when
she goes on tours (as a famous guitarist). She views these previously received Benefits as
negative, and thus they are Cumulative Costs.
However, to Jenny these Perceived Costs and Ambiguity she has are outweighed by the
previously received Rewards regarding the purchase of a new guitar. This means that the
Perceived Cumulative Value of the Cumulative Benefits of this Consideration is positive.
Innate Aspects: Sentimentality.
An Innate Aspect is described as the fluctuating inclinations of a person caused by their
internal factors, such as a person’s mental capabilities and their dispositions. Innate Aspects of
the Cumulative Benefit differ from the Immediate Benefits and Cumulative Benefits in their most
influential Innate Aspect involved in Modifying the valuation of their respective Benefit. The
most influential Innate Aspect for Cumulative Benefit is Sentimentality.
Sentimentality is described as a person’s inclination of being swayed by past gains and
losses. If a person is currently feeling Sentimental, then they would be more swayed by a
Consideration’s Perceived Cumulative Value than a person who is less Sentimental. The Innate
Aspects of Cumulative Benefits, (predominantly Sentimentality) is multiplied by the Perceived
Cumulative Value to become a Modifier of the Perceived Cumulative Value (Cumulative
Benefit’s Innate Aspects * Perceived Cumulative Value). The Cumulative Benefit’s Innate
Aspects can either increase or decrease the value of a Consideration’s Cumulative Benefits.
•

This depends on how high or low a person’s Innate Aspects of Cumulative Benefits are,
though it is predominantly influenced by a person’s Sentimentality, as well as whether the
Perceived Cumulative Value is positive or negative.

The exact manner in which internal factors affect Innate Aspects (like Sentimentality) is
not explained by the SBST. Rather the SBST simply acknowledges the relationship Innate
Aspects has with a Subject’s internal factors.

Figure 25: Cumulative Benefit’s Innate Aspects Circled

Figure 25. An image of the Cumulative Benefit’s Innate Aspects for the Benefits of the
Consideration Titled “Buying a new guitar” circled in red.

Jenny’s Decision: The Role of Innate Aspects.
Jenny is not a very Sentimental person. While being mentally capable of valuing the past,
she does not have a disposition towards Sentimentality. Jenny is looking towards the future; not
fixating on the past.
Although, Jenny has received Benefits in the past from buying a new guitar (like the
pleasant thoughts of becoming a celebrity, being encouraged and dissuaded by her friends, and
has some Ambiguity regarding how she should feel about those who attempted to dissuade her)
she regards these Benefits with little importance.
As such, her Cumulative Benefit’s Innate Aspect has a low value. Since her Perceived
Cumulative Value is positive, Jenny’s low amount of Sentimentality reduces the value of the
Cumulative Benefit. However, the Cumulative Benefits would still have a vital role in the
valuation of the Three Benefits when all three of the Benefits’ value are added to one another to
form the value of the Three Benefits. So, although her Cumulative Benefits are low, they still
have significance.
Cumulative Benefit’s Trade History.
Trade History is the same for all Three Benefits. Although their individuality is
recognized, there is no difference (at present) in how Trade History is calculated for the different
types of Benefits.

General Impressions.

Impressions derives their value from the sum of the Three Benefits.
Disparity Between Perceived Option Benefits Upon Selection and Upon Receipt
As explained throughout the paper, the SBST relies on the Subject’s Understanding of
the world, rather than an omniscient comprehension. This means that what a Subject Perceives as
being positively Beneficial may not be as positively Beneficial as they Perceived it to be. There
may be a distinct disparity between the Subject’s Perceived Option Benefit at the point of
selection and how they Perceived the Option upon receipt of its Benefits. This disparity, when
negative, is described as being Cheated. The notion of being Cheated does not require malicious
intent from any other party; it may be due to the Subject’s ignorance (or lack of omniscience) on
the Option. An example of this occurring would be that, upon arrival to Kyle’s house, Jenny
realizes that Kyle’s kids are hosting an unexpected slumber party so she has to babysit Kyle’s
kids as well as their friends (and, as stated in the beginning, Jenny does not like kids so she was
Cheated).
The disparity may also be positive, i.e. the Subject’s Perceived Option Benefit at the point
of selection is lower than how they Perceived the Option upon receipt of its Benefits. This
disparity when positive may be described as being Astounded (no single word seems to
succinctly encapsulate the idea of positively receiving more than expected, as shown on this
forum Ref. 91, so “being Astounded” seems suitable enough). An example of this occurring would
be that after Jenny babysits for Kyle, and everything went as she expected, he decided to pay
Jenny $90 instead of the agreed upon $50 (so, in this case, Jenny was Astounded).

21 Strategies Implied by the SBST
By combining the knowledge shared in this paper thus far, strategies develop from the
mathematical relationships of the elements of the SBST. Since the SBST is a systematic
framework whose purpose is to describe human motivation, we can use these mathematical
relationships to persuade a person to select a specific Option by increasing its Perceived Option
Benefit relative to other Options. So far, 21 strategies implied by the SBST have been identified
that achieve this goal.
It should be noted that the ethical and moral implications of each strategy is irrelevant to
SBST; these are just valid strategies used in voluntary Trades.
Strategy 1: Remove Considerations or add Considerations
When contemplating a Trade, its Considerations are typically the largest contributor for an
Option’s Benefit. These Considerations may be features of a product, responsibilities associated
with an Option, an (intangible) emotional gain, along with many more possible Considerations.
By adding positive Considerations and removing negative Considerations (and doing the inverse
for competing Options) you raise the relative Benefit an Option.
•
•

This strategy is enacted by advertisements when they explain the positive Benefits of their
product and the pitfalls of their competitors Ref. 19.
This strategy is used in debate when a person uses a “strawman” Ref. 10 against their
opponent’s argument. They misrepresent their opponent’s argument by adding negative
Considerations and removing the argument’s positive Considerations.

Strategy 2: Remove Options or Provide Additional Options
When comparing Options, there is often an Option that far outweighs another. One way to
combat this is to remove the Option altogether or provide other Options.
•

•

Large companies may use the strategy of removing Options by restraining competition in
their industry, through high barriers-to-entry Ref. 39 and mergers Ref. 63 (which reduces
Options for consumers).
Companies compete in the same industry by producing Options Ref. 38 that provide a
competitive choice (through the new Options’ Considerations) for the consumer.

Strategy 3: Provide Option Focus to Options or Remove Option Focus from Other Options
When comparing Options, there is often an Option that far outweighs another. One way to
combat this is to increase Option Focus toward your proposed Options or draw Option Focus
away from other Options.
•

A person may use reminders Ref. 27 to ensure that their Option Focus retains high Option
Focus.

•

A company may use large promotion strategies, like buying ads at the Superbowl to
dramatically raise Option Focus in a wide audience Ref. 23.

•

A company may use humor Ref. 95 in their ads so that people talk about their Option long
after the advertisement stops playing.

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade
•

A company may hide alternative Options so that their consumers don’t even know about
them.

•

Advertisements also limit Option Focus do this by stating that you can purchase their
products or endure a worse state of existence Ref. 6 and expresses these as two binary
states. When, in actuality, there may be several other products Ref. 90 to choose from which
may confer similar effects.

Strategy 4: (in an interpersonal Trade) Increase the Value of Your Appeal to character Or
Decrease the Value of Other Options’ Appeal to Character
When comparing a variety of Options (not shown here) with products that hardly seem
differentiated, an entity’s character Ref. 30 is immensely important in tipping a Trade towards their
favor.
•

In the car industry, we typically recognize a brand by the character it portrays rather than
the inherent quality and differentiation of the car’s components.
o Subaru has created a character that Evokes loving family values Ref. 89
o Dodge has created a character that Evokes a sense of freedom Ref. 65

•

In a debate people with a shaky argument may choose to attack the character of their
opponents with an insult or an argumentum ad hominem Ref. 96 to lower the overall Trade
value of their opponent’s argument.

•

Brands can do community service
brand image

•

Brands can also aim to increase their brand’s image Ref. 43or put down a competitor’s
brand Ref. 101 image to make competing Options less valuable, in a relative sense.

•

Companies may use advertisements to define the attributes of their character Ref. 66 to
consumers.

Ref. 37

and humanitarian work Ref. 20 to increase their

Strategy 5: Control an Option’s Evoked Set of Primary Considerations
When contemplating a Trade, its Considerations are typically the largest contributor for an
Option’s Benefit. These Considerations may be features of a product, responsibilities associated
with an Option, an (intangible) emotional gain, along with many more possible Considerations.
By controlling what Considerations are Evoked when an Option is brought up, much less
convincing is necessary to encourage a person to accept a Trade.
1. This strategy is enacted by marketers when they use product positioning Ref. 74 strategies
to more thoroughly convey the Benefits of a product to their consumers.
2. This strategy is used in ads that are used to inform consumers about the product Ref. 67, as
they provide the relevant Considerations for their product and show how they perform
well in those Considerations.

Strategy 6: Limit and Control an Option’s Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations
When contemplating a Trade, its Considerations are typically the largest contributor for an
Option’s Benefit. These Considerations may be features of a product, responsibilities associated
with an Option, an (intangible) emotional gain, along with many more possible Considerations.
By adding positive Considerations and removing negative Considerations (and doing the inverse
for competing Options) you raise the relative Benefit an Option.
•

This strategy is commonly enacted by deodorant advertisements Ref. 5, as they rarely
provide any information about the Benefits of the product; thus reducing any MetaConsiderations. Instead, they rely on being able to persuade a person’s General
Impressions of the product through establishing a very high Opinion towards the little
amount that the customer Understands.

•

This strategy is used in time restricted promotions Ref. 103, as the person does not have the
time to think about the Option for long enough to create a thorough Evoked Set of MetaConsiderations and must act on their General Impressions of the product.

Strategy 7: Make someone believe that they have already accepted the Trade
When comparing Options, a person contemplates whether making a Trade. This Trade is
comparing Options to determine what change of state they should make- if any. However, if they
already believed that they made the Trade then a new Trade is not necessary. This strategy is
quite popular with beliefs, as there is no tangible proof of previous beliefs.
•

This strategy is enacted when marketers try to make the consumer think an
Understanding, or Opinion originated from themselves; that the belief was “their idea”
Ref. 35
.

•

This strategy is used in debates where a person commits the fallacy of putting forward a
“complex question” Ref. 9 which presupposes that part of the question has already been
accepted.

Strategy 8: Lower Immediate Ambiguity
Typically, there is very little Immediate Ambiguity in a Trade due to the short-term nature of
the Benefit. However, some companies use this to their advantage.
•

In the gambling industry this strategy is used in the form of the “near-miss” Ref. 50. If
people believe that a Benefit is near, then it reduces Ambiguity of the Trade. Slot
machines Ref. 2 are a great example of this strategy.

•

A company may also create a sense of mystery around a product and surround the
mystery with positive connotations and buzzwords in the hopes that the customer will
satisfy their “Perceived lack of Opinions and Understanding” by coming to conclusions
from their current Opinion and Understanding in ways that reduce Immediate Ambiguity.
Starbucks’ elaborate coffee specials Ref. 78 are an example of this strategy in practice, as
they tend not to give much information about it but offer enough for the customer to fill
in the rest.

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade
Strategy 9: Lower Immediate Costs
When the Immediate Costs of a product are greater than its Rewards, then it will need
compensate for this disparity. One method is to lower the product’s Costs
•

The most common way of doing this is to lower the economic price of a product Ref. 73.
That way the money paid for it is justified to the consumer.

•

A new way that companies are reducing Immediate Costs is through reducing consumer
responsibilities.
•

If a person wanted to get an item from a brick and mortar store, they would be
responsible for driving to the store, walking around to find the item, paying for it,
and then carrying it back to their house. Through Amazon Ref. 3, these
responsibilities are reduced. A person only needs to search for the item using their
phone, tap one-click to pay, and wait for its arrival. This subversion of typical
industry practices Ref. 44 is a strategy to lower Immediate Costs.

Strategy 10: Increase Immediate Rewards
When the Immediate Costs of a product are too high, a company can compensate by
increasing the its Immediate Rewards.
3. In most industries, a company may choose to increase the quality of product to justify its
Costs. Some examples of these techniques include the following:
o A company may increase the Perceived quality of the materials used in a product Ref.
60

o A company may increase the quality of the product’s packaging

Ref. 25

o A company may try to give a higher Immediate return on a purchase by letting you
receive more for your purchase Ref. 92
Strategy 11: Increase or decrease Person’s Impulsiveness
When the Immediate Rewards of a product outweigh its Immediate Ambiguity and Immediate
Costs, the Benefit can be heightened by increasing a person’s Impulsiveness.
•

Several industries do this through emotively charged visuals.
o Sexual impulses are commonly used by deodorant commercials
its consumers more Impulsive.

Ref. 58

to make

o Many companies use color psychology Ref. 77 in their advertisements. An
example of this is using the color red in an advertisement Ref. 36 to increase
appetite and passion.
•

Another example of this would be the usage of emotionally charged audios Ref. 81 to
elicit an emotional response from potential customers. An example of this would be
in commercials for children’s toys Ref. 4.

Strategy 12: Lower Forecasted Ambiguity
When contemplating the Forecasted Benefit of an Option, there may be a significant amount
of Ambiguity, as a person cannot fully Understand the future (and a Perceived lack of
Understanding increases). Companies can make an effort to lower the Forecasted Ambiguity to
increase the value of a Trade.
•

Provide a warranty Ref. 49, to protect against possible future damages or changes

•

Provide a money back guarantee Ref. 70, to protect against a customer’s potential product
dissatisfaction

•

Provide a description for the product’s intended outcome Ref. 104

Strategy 13: Lower Forecasted Costs
When the Forecasted Costs of a product are greater than its Rewards, then it will need to
compensate for this disparity. One method is to lower the product’s Costs
•

•

One way is to alleviate any potential Costs associated with the product.
o An example of this would be a dentist explaining the effects of a treatment
through pamphlets Ref. 61 and discussion Ref. 52. So that the patient’s Understanding
of the treatment’s potential Costs (such as pain, future impacts, and monetary
fees) are not affected by any negative misconceptions.
Another way is to monetarily reduce a price or responsibilities for the product in the
future. An example of this is paying a loan early Ref. 72.

Strategy 14: Increase Forecasted Rewards
When the Forecasted Costs of a product are too high, a company can compensate by
increasing the its Forecasted Rewards.
•

•
•

Companies tend to emphasize the durability and longevity of a product Ref. 105, which
increases Forecasted Rewards of purchasing that product- as it lasts for a longer time
period.
Companies may state the future Benefits of their product to the customer and express it in
a way that creates a positive Opinion Ref. 33 towards that new Understanding.
Companies may describe the long-term Benefits of owning a product as an investment;
that if they buy the product now, then they will receive a greater Benefit in the future.
This occurs with antiques, stocks, and commodities that are purchased for resale Ref. 18.

Strategy 15: Increase or Decrease Person’s Prudence
When the Immediate Rewards of a product outweigh its Immediate Ambiguity and Immediate
Costs, the Benefit can be heightened by increasing a person’s Prudence.
•

Several industries do this through emotively charged visuals.
o Some companies use future danger, like potential danger to the planet Ref. 102, potential
dangers to your family Ref. 62, and potential dangers to yourself Ref. 41 to increase a
viewer’s Prudence.

o Other companies use the future-centric concepts, like scientific progress Ref. 86 and
preparing a better world for children Ref. 87 to shift a viewer’s dispositions towards
increased Prudence.
Strategy 16: Lower Cumulative Ambiguity
Typically, there is very little Cumulative Ambiguity in a Trade due to the fact that the Trades
have already occurred. However, some companies use this to their advantage.
•

A company may state that a person lacked a full Opinions/Understanding of the Costs
and Rewards when they received them. Then by telling them the “full story” Ref. 59 a
company can change how a person Perceives their Cumulative Costs and Rewards.

•

A company may also create a sense of misconceptions around a product so that people
can re-evaluate Ref. 84 their Cumulative Costs and Rewards and come to a new Attitude
towards them.

Strategy 17: Lower Cumulative Costs
Since the Cumulative Costs have already occurred, a company can do very little to change
that they have already happened.
•

•

The most common way of doing this is to lower the Cost by changing the way people feel
about those Costs (their Opinions of what they Understand), such as providing
compensation Ref. 28 for those previous Costs.
A company may proactively Ref. 64 attempt to limit potential future Cumulative Costs by
providing a product or service that is reliably Beneficial and has low Costs.

Strategy 18: Increase Cumulative Rewards
Since the Cumulative Rewards have already occurred, a company can do very little to change
that they have already happened.
•

•

•

The most common way of doing this is to increase the Cumulative Rewards by changing
the way people feel about those Rewards. An example of this is showing how difficult it
was for the company to provide those Rewards. Ref. 68
A company may attempt to increase potential future Cumulative Rewards by providing a
product or service that is constantly provides Rewards to its customers. An example of
this is a company’s Rewards program Ref. 47.
A company may provide a trial period Ref. 1 to use their product, which increases the
product’s Cumulative Rewards before committing to a purchase.

Strategy 19: Increase or decrease Person’s Sentimentality
When the Cumulative Rewards of a product outweigh its Cumulative Ambiguity and
Cumulative Costs, the Benefit can be heightened by increasing a person’s Sentimentality.
•

Several industries do this through emotively charged visuals.
o Nature Ref. 24, nostalgia Ref. 79, and family Ref. 31 are commonly used to make its
consumers more Sentimental.

62

Another example of this is found in advertisements that show the longevity of people’s
loyalty to the brand Ref. 29.

Strategy 20: Control Trade History to improve all Benefits
Controlling a product’s Trade History, mainly the recency and frequency of success and
failure for previous Trades, can have a major impact on a Trade’s Benefits.
•

•

Having greater time between successful Trades (low recency of a successful Trade), can
increase the value of the product by creating a sense of rarity. This can be seen with
seasonal food products Ref. 88.
Having a high frequency of a successful Trade can increase the value of a Trade by
making the Trade habitual Ref. 71.

Strategy 21: Control Opinions/Understanding to modify all Benefits
Opinions/Understanding is the root cause of a Consideration’s Attitude. Controlling a
person’s Opinions/Understanding affects the Perceived Costs, Rewards, and Ambiguity of all
Three Benefits.
•

This strategy is quite common for Marketers Opinions/Understanding can be shaped
through a multitude of methods. Here are some examples of these methods:
o A product can hold a specific place in a person’s mind, which Marketers control
through product positioning Ref. 45.
o A product’s Opinions/Understanding can be shaped by endorsement from celebrities
Ref. 26
.
o A Subject’s Opinions/Understanding for a Product can be informed by the news Ref. 17

Applications of the SBST
As a systematic framework that implies strategies to persuade a person to accept a Trade,
the SBST has obvious applications for Understanding people’s decisions and persuading people
to make a decision. The SBST can likely be used in any general scenario where human
motivation plays a role. However, this section will explore the less obvious applications of the
SBST that can be used even in the SBST’s current state (although it will be done in broad detail,
as each application of the SBST could be its own paper).
Psychotherapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy Ref. 56 to give the therapist a framework in which
to recognize a patient’s thoughts and see how these thoughts affect their feelings and behaviors.
If the patient sees their thoughts, feelings, or behavior as problematic then the therapist sets goals
for the patient to achieve that should change these problems and talks through the problems with
the patient. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown in clinical trials to be highly successful
in helping people who experience depression, phobias, anxiety, and many other similar
experiences. When conducting this procedure, the therapist needs to tailor how they comprehend
and react to thoughts and how they affect feelings and behaviors, for each patient.
When combined with the SBST, these problems of tailoring can be made much easier.
The therapist, rather than relying on their professionally developed intuition to comprehend and

63

react to a patient’s thoughts, can compare the person’s thoughts against the strategies of the
SBST. A patient’s thoughts can be classified by their assumed impact as it relates to the 21
strategies implied by the SBST and then the therapist can set goals that counteract those
strategies or lower those strategies’ effects.
For example, a patient may be thinking that others find them physically unattractive and
this may be stopping them performing public speaking (which they want to be more comfortable
doing). The therapist can recognize that the thought of physical unattractiveness may be taking
on strategy 1 (adding a Consideration). The Consideration that the patient has added in their
assessment of the Option: public speaking is one that has a negative Attitude and is thus lowering
the Perceived Option Benefit. From this, the therapist recognizes the effect of the thought and
can question the patient further to recognize the extent of the Consideration’s negativity; now
they can counteract it by removing the Consideration (perhaps by providing evidence that the
Consideration is baseless and irrelevant or giving them a goal which serves the same purpose) or
they can use any of the other strategies to lower its effects (such as increasing the Forecasted
Rewards of other Considerations, or adding other Considerations that have an equally positive
Attitude). Using the SBST alongside traditional cognitive behavioral therapy practices gives
therapists more structure in how they can react to a patient’s thoughts to change their behaviors.
Product Sentiment Analysis
Having a good product is only part of the process in selling it. Marketers use the 4 P’s
(also called the marketing mix Ref. 54) to describe the variables that can be altered by companies to
influence a customer’s decision in purchasing their goods. The 4 P’s are as follows: product,
price, promotion, and place. By changing these variables, companies can influence customers to
purchase their goods. However, these variables are broad and don’t recognize the customers’
unique desires. Since the SBST assesses an individual’s motivations, it would be very useful to
accompany the 4 P’s with the SBST to remedy this issue.
The SBST can used to look at an individual customer’s motivations and see how they
Perceive the distinct Benefits of your good. While the 4 P’s would state that you should be
thinking about your product in the broad sense, after using the SBST to analyze an individual
you can recognize the specific aspects and features of your product that the individual customer
likes and does not like. This process can be repeated and aggregated, so the company can
recognize Considerations that are commonly positive and negative among their customers. By
performing a full analysis of a customer through the lens of the SBST, specific actionable
insights can be recognized.
An example for the product aspect of the 4 P’s would be the Considerations a person has
for the purchase of that Option. These Considerations may include its durability, materials,
craftsmanship, size, weight, etc. and by looking at their associated Attitude the company can
determine what is most desirable to the customer (the Considerations that have the highest
Attitude), what is detested by the customer (the Considerations that have the lowest, negative
Attitude), and what is unimportant to the customer (Considerations that have a negligible effect
on the Perceived Option Benefit). The company can then allocate Costs where they would have
the greatest impact on customers’ Considerations - by ensuring that negative Considerations are

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade

64

reduced, positive Considerations are maintained and emphasized, and unimportant
Considerations only have enough to maintain themselves (if positive) or removed (if negative).
An example for the price aspect would be an American software company finding a
pricing model for their software package and they were deciding whether to price it as a lump
sum of $60 or $5 over sell it over the course of 12 months (as a subscription payment).
Technically, the price of their good is the same. However, to the customer, it may seem very
different. If, through surveys and questionnaires, they discovered that their customers tended to
be very Prudent and hardly Impulsive then they would hold future Benefits in higher regard than
short-term Benefits. To these customers, a subscription would be a Forecasted Cost that would
be amplified by their Prudence. Therefore, a lump sum should be used, as it would likely be
viewed as short-term Cost that is lowered by their low Impulsiveness.
An example for the promotion aspect of the 4 P’s would be identifying the customers’
Option Focus and Opinions/Understanding of the good. If the customer has a null value of
Option Focus for the Option (likely that they’ve never heard of that good before) then there is no
possibility of the customer purchasing that good. Marketers of that good should then find ways to
increase Option Focus (such as tv advertisements and emails). If the customer has an
Opinions/Understanding of the good’s Considerations that is counter to what the marketers
desire (perhaps from cultural, social, or media influences), then marketers of that good should
find ways of changing the customers Opinions/Understanding. Marketers would have to find
ways of encouraging their customers to voluntarily accept the change of state (from their
previous Opinions and their previous Understanding to what the marketers desire) and they
might do so with tactics listed in strategy 21 described in the section titled “21 Strategies Implied
by the SBST”.
An example of the place aspect would be in identifying the most suitable distribution
channel. In a distribution channel the seemingly most important factors would be the effort used
in acquiring the good, and the information that can be gleaned about the good. Online shoppers
rely on standardization of quality among sold goods, so that reviews of the good and information
offered are accurate for all sold goods. Physical shoppers can engage with the good and learn
information about the good first-hand. In applying the SBST, physical shoppers are at an
advantage in gleaning information about non-standardized goods (such as handcrafted items),
and more Considerations may result from their direct contact with the good. These
Considerations may have a positive or negative Attitude, but from that physical distribution
channel they may have more Considerations that are accurate. Online shoppers would not be
able to glean this information about a non-standardized good, and thus be Cheated upon receipt
of the good. These Cheated online shoppers would likely react resentfully and have a negative
impact on their Considerations and their Opinions/Understanding when purchasing that good in
the future.
As shown above, through the examples given, the SBST can be used in conjunction with
the commonly used 4 P’s for marketers and companies to recognize their customer’s sentiments
towards their goods and thus improve the sales of their goods through specific actionable insights
that are offered by the design of the SBST.

Surveying for the SBST
The SBST can filled out by a person plugging in their Primary Considerations, MetaConsiderations, General Impressions, and Option Focus for each Option. This can be a long
process and requires specialized knowledge about the SBST. Although it is hoped that the SBST
becomes widely known and useful to every single human being on the planet…that goal is a long
way off; relying on people’s knowledge of the SBST may not be feasible for many of the
SBST’s applications. However, the SBST can be turned into a fairly short survey of 5 questions.
1. “On a scale of 1-10 how much focus would you describe yourself having for each of the
following Options [Option 1, Option 2, Option 3…]”
o This would tell the researchers what the survey-taker’s Option Focus is for each of
the Options.
2. “Which of those Options would you select?”
o This tells the researchers which Option has the highest Perceived Option Benefit.
3. “For the selected Option, what were the factors that influenced your decision?”
o This question tells the researchers the Primary Considerations of the selected Option.
o Instead of the survey-taker’s selected Option, the researchers may decide to ask about
a specific Option and this would require a very minor change to the wording of the
question.
4. “How would you describe your Attitude towards each of those factors on a scale of -5 to
+5?”
o This tells the researchers what the Attitude of the Primary Considerations are,
and whether they are positive or negative.
5. “In a short paragraph, explain why these factors were important to you and what made
that factor have a positive or negative Attitude for you.”
o This tells the researchers about the Meta-Considerations of the Primary
Considerations and their Attitude for each of them.
o The Attitude of the Meta-Considerations can be gleaned from the tone of the
survey-taker’s language as well as the second part of the question.
These 5 questions should be enough for researchers to get the necessary information to
fill out the SBST for one Option, with minor modifications depending on the topic and the
survey-taker. If the researchers would like to analyze more than one Option, the survey’s
questions 3-5 can be repeated for each of the Options proposed in question 1.
However, this survey is not infallible. This survey is a type of psychological introspection
that requires people to be comprehensive and truthful in their self-observations. As such, it
has the same faults as introspection. An example of this fault can be observed by a person eating
at a restaurant.
Ref. 22

While there are certain aspects of a restaurants that are very noticeable, like its theme and
décor, some aspects which contribute to the restaurant experience may go unnoticed. Obviously
eating on a clean table is a factor in the restaurant experience but in American restaurants it has
become ubiquitous to the point of imperceptibility. It is an expectation that people have of
restaurants, and while they hardly notice its presence, they tend to notice its absence. In a survey,

66

the survey-taker may not report this unnoticed (yet important) factor, as well as many others like
it. However, for many of the SBST’s applications (like the product sentiment analysis described
previously) true exactness and thorough comprehensiveness are not necessary for it to still be
useful.
Story Writing and Character Development
While Jenny may not be the most compelling character in literature, it is easy to see her
motivations and the reasons for her actions. For writers, this is no easy feat. Writers must keep
track of the backstory and knowledge gained by a character throughout a story to ensure internal
consistency of a character’s motivations. The SBST makes this tremendously easier to track by
having the entirety of a character’s motivations for performing an action described within the
SBST.
Character development in writing is also easy to incorporate into the SBST. A character
performing different actions than what they would have done at the beginning of the story is a
simple matter of strategies being acted upon the character to increase the Perceived Option
Benefit of that Option, relative to other Options. A character changing their moral stance on
another faction’s ideology is due to a change of the character’s Opinions. A character realizing
that the world as they knew it was a lie and deciding to take action comes from a change of the
character’s Understanding. A character realizing that they have a magical power that they can
use to overcome their problem is just an increase in Option Focus for the Option of using their
powers (from a null value, when they weren’t aware of it, to a positive value, when they became
directly aware of their powers).
Monitoring the changes of state that the character goes through and tracking it in the
SBST makes it significantly easier to ensure that each character has a justifiable motivation for
their actions and that their motivations are consistent with what they have experienced.
Although, the paragraphs above seem to make the motivations of a character seem simple and
that’s because through the lens of the SBST…they are. However, the writer still has the task of
conveying these changes of state to the reader, developing the initial character that they apply to
the SBST, and setting up scenarios that incite these changes of state for their characters. The
SBST doesn’t take away the excitement or skill in writing a story, but it makes writing and
tracking a character’s motivations much easier.
Human-like Artificial Intelligence
Human-like artificial intelligence has been a goal for humans since time in memoriam Ref.
51
. Humans have desired to recreate themselves by their own comprehension of themselves and
have continued to try to satisfy this desire be that by chatbots, chess players, and self-driving
cars. Although closer than ever, the goal still seems to be so far away. The SBST can be used to
take a gigantic leap towards achieving human-like artificial intelligence.
The SBST, as stated in the beginning, is a systematic framework whose purpose is to
describe human motivations. The SBST does this through the mathematical relationships
between its elements. The key word there is mathematical. The SBST offers a mathematical
approach to human motivation whereby changes in their motivation is merely the changing of

67

numbers. While humans might have trouble keeping up with all those numbers when using the
SBST, computers are highly skilled at mathematics. By plugging in the SBST into a computer
through programming we might have a human-like artificial intelligence.
Many of the key aspects of programmed artificial intelligence is already integrated into
the design of the SBST. The Cumulative Benefits aspect of the SBST is similar to the
reinforcement learning Ref. 7 that is used by neural networks whereby past positive Rewards and
past Costs affect future behavior. The Forecasted Benefits of the SBST is similar to the longterm planning Ref. 16 required for achieving tasks whose Rewards would only be received in the
future. The Immediate Benefits of the SBST would ensure that the actions taken at every step are
positively Beneficial, rather than being completely willing to negatively Benefit itself in service
for a future goal, it would place some priority on the short-term as well (the extent being
determined by its Impulsiveness). The Trade History would also prevent an AI from doing the
same action repeatedly to gain a positive Benefit, as this would probably decrease the value of
Trade History which decreases the value of the entire Option (making it likely that another
Option would become comparatively more Beneficial which would make the AI select that other,
more Beneficial, Option rather than repeat the same one).
The SBST’s Option Focus would also help tremendously in computation efficiency,
rather than going through every single Option that the AI could physically (or virtually) perform,
it could ignore the Options with a null value of Option Focus, as these could not be selected. An
example of this would be the task of lifting a pen off the floor (imagining a person who has
determined that desiring that the pen be lifted off the floor is a positively Beneficial desire that
they have selected to adopt). There are several (more granular) Options that the person could
take to satisfy their newfound desire: a person could pick it up with their hands, they could pick
it up with their teeth, they could ask another person to pick it up but to do so would require
convincing that person (and there are a near-infinite of ways to convince a person to do lift the
pen, by changing tone of voice, the words used, the accent used, etc. which grow exponentially
with every potential person that they could convince). However, most people (when asked to
pick up a pen) are not aware in the slightest that they could pick it up with their teeth or that they
could convince a stranger to lift up the pen for them while using a fake Irish accent. Since these
Options cannot be chosen (as they have a null Option Focus) even though the person may be
physically capable of doing it; so, the Options’ Perceived Option Benefit does not need to be
calculated.
Safety of the SBST’s Human-like AI
The SBST may also circumvent many of the AI safety concerns Ref. 83 by its design. The
greatest way that is circumvents these concerns, is that an AI developed using the SBST does not
have a specified objective besides selecting changes of state that it Perceives are the most
Beneficial (thus stopping many methods of Reward hacking).
Humans have a vast network of nerves Ref. 32 that provide feedback for their actions which
could help shape their Rewards and Costs. For example, a toddler sees a red stovetop with their
ocular nerves, they get closer to the red stovetop and it sets their thermoreceptors in action, then
they touch the red stovetop and they experience immense pain from their nociceptors. What they

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade

68

Understand mainly comes from their nerves, and how they feel about what they Understand also
tends to come from their nerves. All this to say that if the human-like AI which was developed
using the SBST had a consistent and constant source of feedback that would tell it about the
world and its Benefits, it may be significantly safer and require little oversight as it can identify
Costs and Rewards independent of any human intervention. It would also gain its Understanding
in a similar manner to humans, making it easier to comprehend its behaviors.
The human-like AI would avoid negative side effects, if it knew that an action would
have a Cost. Building the human-like AI in a way that humans are able to express to the humanlike AI that certain actions should be deemed as Costly would be critical, to ensure that what the
human-like AI viewed as Costly and what humans think are Costly align. So long as the 21
strategies are still performable on the human-like AI and humans knew how to use these
strategies on the human-like AI, then humans should be able to convince the human-like AI not
to select Options that the humans deemed negatively Beneficial (this also means that humans
could convince the human-like AI to select Options that would be deemed negatively Beneficial
by some humans, but this is no different than what happens to humans when they are incited to
commit crimes Ref. 76 by others).
The human-like AI would also be encouraged to safely explore Ref. 75 by design. It would
view Ambiguity as negative, being disincentivized to get into situations where it has a Perceived
lack of Opinions/Understanding. Also, it would avoid Options that it viewed as Costly.
However, this Ambiguity and Cost is negated if its associated Rewards (based on its
Opinions/Understanding) is greater than the Costs and Ambiguity. Though, even if the Rewards
it Perceived were greater than the Costs and Ambiguity, it would not select an Option until that
Option had the highest Perceived Option Benefit among competing Options. This means it would
avoid taking any Option it Perceived as being unclear until it had sufficient reasons to believe
that it would be more positively Beneficial than any other Option. It would also be encouraged to
explore through the element of Trade History, as a Consideration that is frequently used in
previously selected Options may decrease the value of that Consideration, and thus its associated
Option, which would encourage the human-like AI to explore other Options that do not have the
frequently used Consideration. Although, how specific Trade Histories affect Benefits has not
been fully explained by the SBST, but this imprecision may be remedied in the future with future
developments on the SBST.
The human-like AI would be as robust to distributional change as only other human, it
would not know how to deal with a new scenario without Opinions/Understanding of it (which
might be gained through instruction, experience, or some other mechanism of epistemology) but
if it Perceived that it lacked Opinions/Understanding (it had Ambiguity) then it would be
disincentivized to engage with it. An AI that is developed using the SBST is likely to be more
human-like and may be more safe than traditional AI.
However, there are still some problems that the programmer would have to face. These
mainly include three problems. The first being Evocation. What possible source of Evocation
would they choose to use? The second being Understanding. How would an AI have beliefs
about the properties of their surroundings and the consequences of their actions? Thirdly being

The Self-Beneficial System of Trade

69

Opinions. How would an AI have feelings about what they Understand, and how would it have
emotional and moral associations?
The best candidate, that I am aware of, in solving many of these problems would be
DeepMind’s imaginative AI Ref. 69. This AI has an internal model that allows the AI to recognize
the properties of the world and the consequences of their actions (satisfying the issue of
Understanding). It has an incentive structure that provides Rewards for performing specific
actions or achieving certain goals – giving the AI rudimentary feelings that relate to its
Understanding (Opinions). It does not seem to use a method for Evocation but using any of the
possible sources of Evocation discussed earlier or tailoring an Evocation method suited for its
task may be enough. Also, the Considerations used by Jenny in the example all seem to relate to
states (i.e. past states, current states, and consequential states) that are relevant to the Option.
While there are likely other Considerations that do not relate to relevant states (as the definition
of Considerations is broad enough to encompass more than states) it would be fairly easy for a
programmer to determine states that are relevant to an Option and get the value of these states to
describe Considerations. Although it should be mentioned that I am not an expert in the field of
machine learning, so my explanation may not accurately describe the mechanisms and intent of
DeepMind’s software or the ease of programming such a human-like AI.
Also, this human-like AI developed through the SBST likely could not pass the Turing
Test Ref. 94 at its inception or… perhaps ever. Learning to speak English is not a necessity for an
AI that is built with the SBST. It would be more like a toddler; stumbling around; attempting to
find out which things are positively Beneficial, and which are negatively Beneficial. The AI
might learn to speak if pattern recognition was Rewarded in the program (making it positively
Beneficial), and accurate pattern recognition was Rewarded by a source that was already aware
of the pattern (like a parent smiling and giving praise to a toddler for learning a new word).
Although much of this is hopeful thinking, I believe that the SBST can have a tremendous
impact on AI research in the quest of creating a human-like AI.
There are many more applications for the SBST some of which I already know (such as
its application in contracting to ensure that neither party is Cheated) and others that I could
hardly imagine. Even in the applications above, there is a lot more exploring to be done with
these ideas and each could be the topic of its own paper. At this point I hope that the
explanations of the previous sections and the applications presented here have inspired ways that
you (the reader) can utilize the SBST and proven the SBST’s comprehensiveness and usefulness.
SBST and Involuntary Trades
The SBST covers all voluntary Trades, where a person can actively choose between
potential Trades (Options). However not all Trades are voluntary, as comprehensive as it is, the
SBST does not cover these involuntary Trades.
An example of an involuntary Trade would be, hypothetically, if Jenny decided to drive
to Kyle’s house and was crashed into by another driver. This would be a change of state (the
bruising, the damage to her car, the fear surging through her) and it would not be Perceived to be
a positively Beneficial one. If given the chance to choose another Option, other than getting

70

crashed into, she likely would. However, the Trade was not voluntary (she didn’t select the
Option) it was an involuntary Trade. The SBST is not able to explain this or any other
involuntary Trade.
Another example of an involuntary Trade would be instinctively flinching, such as a knee
jerk reaction. There seems to be no selection of an Option going on, in many cases the reaction
occurs before even traveling to the brain (and is instead mediated by nerves in the spinal column
as a spinal reflex Ref. 85). These instinctive reactions are viewed as involuntary changes of state
(Trades) and are thus not explained by the SBST.
Limitations of the SBST
As stated in the introduction, the SBST is still in its preliminary stages and thus some
limitations are to be expected however there are also limitations that are an effect of the design
of the SBST. This section will explore these limitations.
1. The SBST is not useful for describing involuntary Trades, such as knee jerk reactions.
2. The SBST does not adequately explain how an Evoked Set of Meta-Considerations or
how an Evoked Set of Primary Considerations is created for Options. In its current state,
the Evoked Set of Considerations (both Primary and Meta) can only be inferred based on
the Option and assumptions based on the Subject.
3. The SBST uses arbitrary numbers to describe ordinal relationships between variables.
While this is a useful representation to view the increases and decreases of variables and
how they relate to one another, it does not allow mathematical functions to be applied to
the system without a standardization of what the specific numbers represent.
4. The SBST uses generalizations to describe many of its terms, such as: “Innate Aspects”,
“Trade History”, and “Ambiguity”. Similarly, it does not adequately distinguish the
temporal difference between Immediate Benefits and Forecasted Benefits. More
specificity is necessary to apply a truly mathematical approach to the system.
5. The static pictorial representation of the SBST used in this paper is limited in how much
information it can convey to a user of the SBST.
Further Research
There is much work to be done in the development of the SBST. I have attempted to be as
thorough as possible with the explanations and examples provided, although I realize that people
with specialized expertise may be able to offer a great deal to the SBST and fill in any gaps that I
may have overlooked or neglected to explain. Further research can be done in its explanation, its
comparison to past ideas related to the SBST, and the many applications of the SBST. Here are
some of the avenues of research that I would suggest to those who are capable and willing to
advance the SBST.
1. Further research should be done in analyzing the temporal difference between Immediate
Benefits and Forecasted Benefits. In the SBST, it refers to the Immediate as a short time
period from the present, while Forecasted relates to the future, determining at which
point a Benefit changes from Immediate to Forecasted is vital in the usage of the SBST.

Perhaps a general period of time could be used to distinguish the two Benefits, or a more
individualistic view which takes into account the subjective conception of time.
Further research should be done to examine the SBST’s General Impressions (and its
substitute, the Three Benefits) against findings in the field of neuroscience. As described
earlier in this paper, a person’s biology is likely the source of how they determine a
Consideration’s Benefits.
Further research should be done to establish when a person actually compares Options on
the Option Comparison Table. Would it be continuous process? Or would it require an
involuntary Trade (a stimulus of sorts, like asking a person a question) to encourage
someone to compare Options?
Further research should be done to analyze the effects of previous Option selection on
future Option selections.
a. To expand on this point, if an Option is selected but not performed (i.e. the
change of state does not occur) what happens?
b. Perhaps if a previously selected Option (e.g. driving to the mall) is unfulfilled
then future Options (e.g. finding your keys) would have the satisfaction of this
unfulfilled Option as part of their Considerations.
c. This possibility might be validated through Evocation techniques. The
Consideration of satisfying an unfulfilled previously selected Options would be
treated as any other Consideration and would have to be Evoked.
Further research should be done to examine the effectiveness of the SBST in context of
Game Theory Ref. 40, that is using your comprehension of a person to simulate their
decision through the SBST to better plan your actions. This should help in the
development of more specific Evocation techniques, as better techniques are found that
accurately represent the other person’s Evoked Considerations.
Further research is needed to express the specific nature of the terms described by the
SBST, one of which is Trade History. While the relationship between Trade History and
the Benefits seems accurate (as a Modifier) the finer details of how particular Trade
Histories can differ in the way they Modify the Benefits of a Consideration has not been
fully explored.
Further research should be done to recognize what types of Considerations a person may
have. The Considerations in this paper are mostly all a recognition of states: past states,
current states (e.g. current supply of money), and consequential states (e.g. get to sleep
early). These all neatly fit within the current definition of Considerations due to its
breadth. However, if these are the only kind of Considerations that a person may have,
then it should be acknowledged in the definition of Considerations.
Finally, I would urge people to research ways to utilize the SBST. Do you want to write a
self-help book on how the SBST can help people’s marriages by recognizing each other’s
motivations? Go for it. Do you want to write a blog about how people can use the 21
strategies to close a deal with absolutely anyone? Sure, keep it legal, but you can do that.
Do you want to develop the first human-like AI and make billions? Go do it. The SBST is

allows you to do almost anything you want with the SBST and keep the profits. I wanted
the SBST to be a useful tool for as many people as possible, so go find ways to use it!
Conclusion
The SBST expresses human motivation in a systematic framework whose elements can
be analyzed and manipulated for various purposes, from developing artificial intelligence to
marketing a product. Human motivation plays a role in nearly all aspects of society…and
wherever human motivation plays a role, the SBST can be used to better analyze it or manipulate
it. Even in the SBST’s current state, its usefulness extends to all people regardless of their
occupation, age, or origins.
It should be acknowledged that the SBST is still in a preliminary state. There is still a lot
more to learn about how each element works and the various factors that can influence them.
Applying the rigor of traditional methods of study, like the scientific method, will hopefully
make these elements and their relationships clearer and thus more useful.
It is with great hope that I offer the SBST to the academic and the non-academic
community alike. I hope that they will recognize its merits as being valid, from the numerous
examples and extensive explanations, and as being useful, from the many applications provided
in this paper and implied by the design of the SBST. I look forward to seeing people use the
SBST in their lives and the advancements that will be made in the SBST; taking the SBST from
its current preliminary state to its final state.
