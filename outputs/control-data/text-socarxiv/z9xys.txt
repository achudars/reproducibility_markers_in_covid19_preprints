The current research employed a classic irrelevant sound effect paradigm and

investigated the talker-specific content of the irrelevant speech. Specifically, we aimed to
determine if the participants’ familiarity with the irrelevant speech’s talker affected the

magnitude of the irrelevant sound effect. Experiment 1 was an exploration of talker familiarity

established in a natural listening environment (i.e. a university classroom) in which we

manipulated the participants’ relationships with the talker. In Experiment 2 we manipulated the
participants’ familiarity with the talker via 4 days of controlled exposure to the target talker’s

audio recordings. For both Experiments 1 and 2, a robust effect of irrelevant speech was found;

however, regardless of the talker manipulation, talker familiarity did not influence the size of the

effect. We interpreted the results within the processing view of the auditory distraction effect and
highlighted the notion that talker familiarity may be more vulnerable than once thought.

immediately recall visually presented information (Colle & Welsh, 1976), and this auditory

distraction phenomenon is often referred to as the irrelevant sound effect (ISE). The ISE is one

example of an auditory distraction paradigm that provides researchers with an ecologically valid
construct to explore theoretical aspects of cognition intertwined with short-term memory and

selective attention, while simultaneously working towards an understanding of its underlying

neurological mechanisms (for a review see Hughes & Jones, 2001). As a result, researchers

explore the ISE from a number of perspectives via various manipulations, one of which is to

investigate the acoustic and semantic content of the irrelevant speech in an attempt to determine
which of its properties affect the magnitude of the ISE (e.g., Tremblay & Jones, 1999; Röer,

Körner, Buchner, & Bell, 2017). Despite the fact that the research on this particular auditory
distraction paradigm extends over 40 years, researchers do not agree on the precise

mechanism(s) of the disruption to serial recall performance. The current research drew upon

findings from the field of hearing science to understand the role of the talker-specific content of

the irrelevant speech; thus, utilizing an interdisciplinary approach to gain a clearer understanding
of the cause of this distraction.

Views of Auditory Distraction

While it is well accepted that the degree of acoustic variability of the irrelevant sounds is

critical for the disruptive effect on serial recall to occur (i.e. the changing state effect; Ellermeier
& Zimmer, 2014; Jones, Madden, & Miles, 1992), the role of attentional factors has been called

into question. For example, an individual’s working memory capacity does not have a

relationship with the size of their ISE (see Beaman, 2004; Elliott & Briganti, 2012). This lack of

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

a relationship between the size of the ISE and working memory capacity is in contrast to research
employing an auditory deviant paradigm. The serial recall version of the deviant paradigm is

similar in design to the ISE; however, research participants are presented with irrelevant sounds

that contain an unexpected and deviant item (e.g., a male voice changing to a female voice). The
magnitude of the deviant effect in the auditory deviant paradigm was shown to correlate with
working memory capacity (e.g., Sörqvist & Rönnberg, 2014; although see Körner, Röer,

Buchner, & Bell, 2017 for an opposing view).

Hughes (2014) built upon the divergence of these two signature findings, the changing-

state effect (Jones et al., 1992) and the auditory deviant effect (Hughes, Vachon, & Jones, 2007)

to support the duplex model of auditory distraction. Within this model, it is hypothesized that the
degree of disruption in the changing-state effect is caused by the overlap in processing demands
resulting from the obligatory order cues in to-be-ignored auditory stimuli, conflicting with the

order cues of the to-be-remembered stimuli, especially when serial order recall is required (i.e.

interference by process). The changing acoustic features of the to-be-ignored stimuli are referred
to as a form of precategorical auditory distraction (Marsh et al., 2018). In contrast,

postcategorical auditory distraction results from semantic or phonological features of the to-be-

ignored stimuli that may result in attention capture (e.g., Röer et al., 2017).

Prior researchers have also examined the role of attentional factors in auditory distraction

effects, and proposed a functional view of auditory distraction (e.g., Allport, 1993; Neumann,

1996; Hughes & Jones, 2003). Within this view, it is argued that people must maintain a balance
of attentional selectivity. That is, they must be able to focus on processing the experimental task
in the forefront (e.g., visual digit-span task), while also allowing for some monitoring or

awareness of the irrelevant auditory channel’s content. This internal monitoring promotes human

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

survival. The openness to incoming auditory information allows an individual to perceive and
process something critical, like the sound of an emergency vehicle’s siren or a building’s fire

alarm. Supporting this functional view, Röer et al. (2017) conducted experiments using an ISE
serial recall paradigm with taboo words presented in the irrelevant channel. When a variety of
taboo words were presented, as opposed to the repetition of the same taboo word or neutral

words, the participants’ serial recall was significantly more disrupted by the changing taboo
words than changing neutral words.

The finding—changing taboo words yield the greatest disruption—is a critical piece of

evidence that people process the semantic content of the irrelevant sounds. Because the

participants in their study were instructed to ignore the auditory information, without a functional
system of selectivity, the effect of the changing taboo words should have been no different than

the changing neutral words. Röer et al. (2017; Experiment 2) further suggested that the disruptive
effect of taboo words was not related to individual levels of working memory capacity. The
authors’ overall interpretation of the findings reflected upon the flexibility of the cognitive

system, as opposed to viewing the disruption from the changing taboo words as a failure of the
system. While researchers have shown a number of sounds cause disruption to focal task

performance, such as tones or alarms, the authors discussed the potential importance of speech as
a distracting stimulus. As stated by Röer et al., “it seems plausible that speech sounds (and

sounds that resemble speech in their physical properties) play a special role” (p. 748). Examining
the components of the speech sounds in the irrelevant channel may provide new insights into the
processing of irrelevant information. This was the case in the present study, when we

manipulated the research participants’ familiarity with the speaker of the irrelevant speech.

indexical or talker-specific information (Abercrombie, 1967; Pisoni, 1997). The linguistic

information refers to the segmental speech components such as phonemes and morphemes while
the talker-specific information includes components reflected in the speech signal that are

particular to an individual talker's voice (e.g., accent, gender, age, etc...) as opposed to any

linguistic content. Historically, many studies in the field of speech perception focused on the

perception, encoding, processing, and retrieval of the linguistic information (e.g., Kuhl, 1993;

Liberman, 1957; Nearey, 1990), while the talker-specific information in the speech signal was
often unaccounted for or dismissed from the problem space. Over the past decades, however,
researchers showed that the talker-specific information is neurologically coupled with its

linguistic information (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011; Naoi, et al., 2012) and often affects the

perception and processing of linguistic information across a variety of listeners and a number of
laboratory tasks. In particular, when a listener is familiar with a talker’s voice, the listener’s

ability to perceive and process the talker’s speech is often better than if they are listening to a

stranger (e.g., Nygaard & Pisoni, 1998; Souza, Gehani, Wright, & McCloy, 2013). Furthermore,
the talker familiarity effect seems strongest when listeners are explicitly reminded of their

relationship with the talker before the experimental task begins (Newman & Evers, 2007).

Interestingly, despite past work examining talker variability in the to-be-ignored auditory stimuli

(Hughes, Marsh, & Jones, 2009; 2011), no prior studies on the ISE have attempted to manipulate
the relationship of the research participant’s familiarity with the talker.

attentional resources towards the irrelevant channel (taboo words, Röer et al., 2017; one’s own

name, Röer, Bell, & Buchner, 2013), whereas an interference-by-process view instead places
emphasis on the processes needed to complete the task at hand (Hughes, 2014) and the

precategorical features of the irrelevant speech (Marsh et al., 2018). Based upon the findings of
Röer and colleagues, in addition to the known effects of talker familiarity on speech perception
(Nygaard & Pisoni, 1998; Souza et al., 2013), we predicted that the greater the degree of

familiarity of the participant with the talker, the greater the resulting size of the disruption to
serial recall performance. This talker familiarity effect would be further increased when the
participant was made explicitly aware of their relationship with the talker, relative to being

uninformed about the talker's identity, or having no familiarity at all. Alternatively, the

interference-by-process view would only predict an effect of talker familiarity if the task
required a specific interaction with the characteristics of the talker’s voice, which is not

necessary to complete a serial recall task. This prediction indicates that in a typical ISE task, the
familiarity of the participant with the talker’s voice producing the irrelevant speech would be
processed as a postcategorical feature.

Experiment 1

In Experiment 1 we explored the role of talker familiarity established in a natural

listening environment—a college classroom (see also Newman & Evers, 2007). We did so within
the context of a classic ISE task and we recruited students from introductory psychology classes
to serve as participants. One third of the participants were a part of the control group and were

unfamiliar with the irrelevant talker’s speech; the remaining participants were familiar with the

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

irrelevant talker’s speech because it was recorded by their introductory psychology class
instructor. Of these remaining participants—half of them were informed that they were familiar

with the talker and half of them were not informed that they were familiar with the talker.

Method

Participants. 207 undergraduate students from a large, state university enrolled in

introductory psychology classes participated in the experiment. We recruited participants

through the university’s Department of Psychology research participant pool, and compensated

them with either course credit or extra credit in psychology classes. We quasi-randomly assigned
participants to 1 of 3 groups based on their familiarity with the background talker. The final

sample (N = 179) included n = 96 for the unfamiliar talker condition, n = 40 for the informed

“familiar” talker condition, and n = 43 for the uninformed “familiar” talker condition. Participant
inclusion criteria were as follows: normal or corrected-to-normal vision; hearing within-typicallimits (5 excluded); and native English speaker (7 excluded). Of the total number of original
participants, 19 were removed from data analyses based on answers to the post-experiment
questionnaire (see Results section for details).

Experimental design. We utilized a 2*3 mixed design with auditory condition (silent,

speech) as a within-subjects factor and talker familiarity (unfamiliar, uniformed, informed) as a
between-subjects factor.

Materials. We used E-Prime software 2.0 (2012) to conduct the experiment on Dell

desktop computers equipped with 17-inch monitors and Sony circumaural headphones. The

experimental setup was located in a sound-treated room. The E-Prime code and stimuli used for

Experiment 1 and 2 can be secured by researchers for replication purposes by emailing the

the monitor and displayed on a white background.

Auditory stimuli. Talker details. A female instructor for an “Introduction to Psychology”

course at the university recorded the distractor sentences.

We expected participants in the familiar condition to be familiar with this voice because

the talker was their introductory psychology instructor. The participants were invited to assist

with the study approximately mid-way through the semester, to ensure that they had ample time

to become familiar with the instructor’s voice. The participants in the unfamiliar condition were
enrolled in introductory psychology course sections other than the target talker’s.

Distractor sentences. Sentences from the Revised List of Phonetically Balanced

Sentences: Harvard Sentences (IEEE, 1969) served as the distractor sentences for all

participants. The sentences were combined and edited into sound files approximately 6s in length
using the Adobe Audition 2.0 (2005) sound editing software on a Dell Optiplex 740 computer

with a Delta 101LT PCI sound card. The recordings were edited and equated across root mean
square (r.m.s.). These edited sentences served as the distractor sentences for all participants.
Procedure. Each participant was tested individually at a personal computer using a

typical ISE paradigm. A researcher obtained informed consent prior to the experiment. The
participants in the unfamiliar and uniformed groups were given no information about the

irrelevant speech’s talker. However, for participants in the informed group, prior to the beginning
of the experiment, “The voice you will hear is your PSYC 2000 professor, [INSTRUCTOR’S
NAME], so you should be familiar with this voice.” appeared on the computer monitor.

ms each, while the distractor sentences were simultaneously presented at a comfortable listening
level via headphones worn by the participant. The total duration of stimuli presentation was
approximately 6000 msec. Of the 40 experimental trials, 20 were silent trials and 20 were

auditory distractor trials; the different trial types were intermixed across the 40 total trials. Each
participant was instructed to remember the digits that they saw on the screen and to ignore the

sentences they heard over the headphones. For each trial, after the digits were presented on the
monitor, the participant was instructed to recall the digits in the order in which they were

presented and use the number key pad to record their responses. After the completion of all trials,
the participant answered follow-up, multiple-choice questions via the computer about the

distractor talker. Follow-up questions can be found in Appendix A. Finally, the experimenter

debriefed the participant and thanked them for their participation.
Results and discussion

Assessing talker familiarity. For our first step in data analysis we examined the

participants’ responses to the follow-up questionnaire. It was critical those participants in the

informed condition, for example, could correctly recognize the talker as familiar and provide the
correct name of their instructor (recall, they were told her name at the beginning of the

experiment). From the original sample, 4 individuals in the informed group responded, “I don’t

know” to the question asking about the familiarity of the to-be-ignored voice. We removed those
individuals from further data analyses since the voice was not “explicitly familiar” to these

participants. Interestingly, in the unfamiliar condition, in which participants were recruited from
a section of “Introduction to Psychology” that was not taught by the to-be-ignored talker, 15

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

participants reported that they were familiar with the voice. Given that these individuals may
have tried to attach a label to the voice—because it is highly unlikely that they were actually

familiar with the correct identity of the talker—we excluded these participants from further data

analyses as well. Recall, the uniformed group was given no instructions regarding the identity of
the speaker, and it was possible that they may have recognized her voice correctly, as she was
their instructor.

Assessing the effect of talker familiarity on the irrelevant speech effect. With the final

sample established (N = 179), we conducted a 2 * 3 mixed-model ANOVA with the within-

participants factor of auditory condition (silent, speech) and the between-participants factor of
talker familiarity (unfamiliar, uniformed, informed). A main effect of auditory condition was

found, F (1, 176) = 428.19, MSE = .007, p < .01, η2p = .71, with higher serial recall performance

in the silent condition (M = .79) than in the presence of speech (M = .59). However, there was no
main effect of talker familiarity (p = .63), and no interaction of talker familiarity with auditory
condition (p = .41; see Figure 1).

We then collapsed the two familiarity conditions into one group (N = 83) and created a

difference score to assess the size of the disruption created by the irrelevant speech. The familiar
group (Mdiff = .20) did not demonstrate a significantly larger difference score than the unfamiliar

group (Mdiff = .19) [t (177) = .73, p = .46].

It is possible that the talker—despite being the participants’ professor and accurately

identified by name via a post-experiment questionnaire—was not actually familiar to either the

uniformed or informed “familiar” groups of listeners. An alternative possibility is that the

demands of the task, ignoring the auditory information and performing serial recall on visually-

presented digits, did not involve any overlap in processing between the irrelevant speech (which

was possibly spoken by a familiar talker) and the required response. Thus, in an attempt to
differentiate between these two theoretical explanations of the results of Experiment 1, we

conducted Experiment 2 and directly manipulated the familiarity of the talker’s voice.
Experiment 2

Given the lack of a significant talker familiarity effect and the little experimental control

available regarding listener familiarity in Experiment 1, we conducted Experiment 2 to address

these concerns. We familiarized listeners with a specific talker’s voice via four days of training
that included 30 minutes/day of narrative exposure followed by an interactive voice detection
task. We hypothesized that this voice training would provide controlled exposure to and

interaction with the target talker’s voice and subsequently affect the magnitude of the ISE, thus

yielding a greater possibility of talker-familiarity effects that were not found in Experiment 1. By
directly manipulating the participants’ familiarity with the talker’s voice, the likelihood of

familiarity leading to an attention capture response (i.e. the strength of the postcategorical feature
to disrupt serial recall performance) is increased. In contrast, if the precategorical features remain
the dominant cause of disruption, then the familiarity of the talker’s voice will not influence the
size of the ISE.
Method

Participants. Sixty-three undergraduate students from a large, state university were

recruited through the university’s Department of Psychology research participant pool to

participate in this experiment. We quasi-randomly assigned participants to either undergo or

forgo talker familiarity training. The final sample included n = 29 talker training condition and n

= 31 for the control condition (N = 60; 53 females, mean age = 23 years). Participant inclusion
criteria were as follows: normal or corrected-to-normal vision; self-reported hearing within-

typical-limits; and a native English speaker. We compensated participants in the control group
with either course or extra credit; we compensated participants undergoing talker training with

Experimental design. We employed a 2*2*2 mixed design with auditory condition

(silent, speech) and time of testing (pre, post) as within-subjects factors; talker training (training,
control) was the between-subjects factor.

Materials. Irrelevant sound task. We used the same materials and stimuli from

Experiment 1 for Experiment 2’s irrelevant sound task.

Talker training. We used E-Prime software 2.0 (2012) to conduct the talker-training

portion of the experiment on Dell desktop computers equipped with 17-inch monitors and Sony

circumaural headphones. The setup was located in a sound-treated room.

Talker exposure task’s auditory stimuli. A total of 14 published short stories were

recorded by the same, female talker who recorded the irrelevant sound task’s distractor

sentences. We recorded the stories in the same manner as the distractor sentences and used them

as stimuli for the talker exposure task. Stories included such pieces as “Eleonora” by Edgar Allen
Poe (1850) and “Experience” by Tessa Hadley (2013).

A researcher uploaded the stories’ audio recordings to Dell Optiplex 740 computer

equipped with a Delta 101LT PCI sound card. They then edited and equated the recordings

across total root mean square (r.m.s.) using Adobe Audition 2.0 (2005) sound editing software.

The stories were combined to yield four different, 30-minute blocks of story audio. Each block

of story audio included a total of three or four stories and was used as stimuli for the 4-day-long

talker exposure task.

Voice detection task. The same female talker who recorded the aforementioned distractor
sentences and stories, also recorded 10 additional Harvard sentences. An additional 12 native

English-speaking females recorded a total of 60 Harvard sentences. A researcher uploaded these
audio recordings to same Dell computer. They again edited and equated across total root mean

square (r.m.s.) using the Adobe Audition 2.0 (2005) sound editing software for these stimuli. The
sentences were utilized to yield four different sets of 15 voice detection trials. Each sentence set
was used as stimuli for the voice detection task which served as the final component of the 4day-long training protocol.

Procedure. Experiment 2’s procedure consisted of three components: baseline, pre-

training ISE task (pre-test); talker training; and post-training ISE task (post-test). The talker

training component of this experiment had two phases 1) talker exposure and 2) voice detection
task; talker training occurred four times over a series of four consecutive days. The pre-test and
post-test components had one phase each (see Figure 2 for a schema).

We administered all components of the experiment in a sound-treated room at a personal

computer equipped with headphones; we trained and tested all participants individually. All of
the speech stimuli were presented at the listener’s maximum comfort level. All components of

the experiment were administered during 4 consecutive days. We counterbalanced talker-, digit-,

and sentence-presentation across all irrelevant sound tasks and participants.

Irrelevant sound task. We used ISE task procedures identical to those of Experiment 1.

A researcher obtained informed consent prior to the experiment. The participants in the control

condition completed an ISE task on Day 1 and Day 4 of the four consecutive days (see Figure 2);

we gave them no information about the irrelevant speech’s talker. The participants in the training
condition also completed an ISE task on Day 1 and Day 4 of the four consecutive days (see

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

15

Figure 2); we familiarized them with the irrelevant speech’s talker over the four consecutive days
of training.

Talker training. Participants in the talker training condition underwent talker training on

Days 1-4. On Day 1 training occurred after the ISE task; on Day 4 training occurred before the

ISE task (see Figure 2). Training began with talker exposure, followed by a voice detection task.
Talker exposure. Talker exposure began with the following message written across the

computer’s monitor: Sally will read you 3 stories. Your job is to relax and listen. The short

story’s title and its author then appeared printed across the screen and the story’s audio began.

The participant listened to a total of 30 minutes of stories—read by the talker who produced the

irrelevant speech in the ISE tasks—via the computer’s headphones. The stories were not repeated
across the 4 days of training. The voice detection task began immediately after the participant
completed their 30 minutes of talker exposure.

Voice detection task. The voice detection task began with the following instructions

written across the computer’s monitor: For this next task, you will hear 3 spoken sentences. Sally
may or may not speak one of the sentences. Your job is to indicate whether or not you heard
Sally’s voice…make your judgement as quickly and accurately as possible. Then, the voice

detection task began. If the participant heard Sally (i.e. the talker who read the stories during

talker exposure) speak one of the three sentences, they pressed the letter “Y” on the computer’s
keyboard. If they participant did not detect Sally’s voice, they pressed the letter “N” on the

computer’s keyboard. The voice detection task consisted of a total of 15 trials; the trials were
never duplicated across the 4 days of training.

correctly recalled was counted independently of whether the entire list was correct or not. Strict
serial recall scoring was used, such that the item had to be in the correct order to be counted as

accurate. Descriptive statistics are illustrated in Figure 3. We utilized a 2 * 2 * 2 mixed ANOVA

with the between-subjects factor of participant group resulting in a non-significant comparison, F
(1, 58) = .161, p = .69, and both of the within-subjects factors resulting in significant main
effects: auditory condition, F (1, 58) = 181.16, MSE = .01, p < .001, η2p = .76, and time of

testing, F (1, 58) = 33.76, MSE = .009, p < .001, η2p = .37. These main effects can be described

as an overall detriment to recall in the presence of speech (M = .69), as compared to silence (M =

.86), and as an improvement from pre-test performance (M = .75) to post-test performance (M =

.80). In other words, in concert with the data from Experiment 1, these data demonstrated robust
irrelevant sound and practice effects. However, despite the experimental manipulation of talker
familiarity via talker training in Experiment 2, there was no effect of talker familiarity.

Talker training: voice detection data. Overall, voice detection performance was high

(M = .88, SD = .08). The high level of accuracy suggests that participants encoded talker-

specific, acoustic characteristics to memory and later used said information to determine whether
or not the target talker’s voice was present among the three audio recordings presented at test.

We also examined the four, different story sets to test for story-specific effects on performance.
Across the four days of talker training sessions, three participants each missed one session. We

therefore excluded these participants from the repeated-measures ANOVA exploring the effect of

story during talker exposure (N = 26). The use of the four different story sets across the four days

of training did not result in any significant differences in voice detection accuracy, F (3, 75) =

1.55, MSE = .01, p = .21, η2p = .06. (See Appendix B for descriptive statistics for the voice
detection task associated with each story set.)

Recall that we conducted Experiment 2 because we questioned whether or not the

irrelevant talker (i.e. the listeners’ professor) was truly “familiar” to the listeners in Experiment

1. Without said familiarity, the precategorical features of the auditory distractors would continue

to drive the participants’ performance without any influence from the postcategorical features. In

Experiment 2 we included a 4-day-long talker training component (i.e. talker familiarization)

prior to the ISE task. Training included 30 minutes of exposure to the ISE talker’s voice via story
narratives followed by a voice detection task including the target voice. Listening to the stories
likely involved passive encoding of the talker-specific characteristics of the voice, while the
voice detection task involved a more active, deeper level of processing on the listeners’ part

(Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977). Subsequently, we predicted that the irrelevant talker’s voice would
be familiar to the trained participants and affect the magnitude of their ISE. This was not the

case. The size of the ISE was statistically indistinguishable in pre-testing and in post-testing,

before and after voice detection training was completed. Familiarity with the irrelevant talker did
not modulate auditory distraction in Experiment 2’s ISE task, suggesting that the precategorical
features remained the dominant contributor to the distraction effects we observed.
General Discussion

Across two experiments, participants’ serial recall was significantly hindered in the

presence of irrelevant background speech, compared to serial recall in quiet (ISE; Colle &
Welsh, 1976; Elliott & Briganti, 2012). Furthermore, these data showed that a person’s

familiarity with the talker did not influence the size of the ISE, whether the participants were
informed of the talker’s identity (Experiment 1) or received four days of talker training that

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

required them to attend to and interact with talker-specific characteristics of the voice
(Experiment 2). These findings are in contrast to our hypotheses and previous speech perception

research comparing listeners’ perception of words spoken by familiar and unfamiliar voices—
familiarity with the talker’s voice typically yields a perceptual advantage (e.g., Barker &

Newman, 2004; Souza et al., 2013; Yonan & Summers, 2000). However, it is important to note,
the majority of these aforementioned studies exploring talker familiarity utilized talkers that the
listeners had long-standing, personal relationships with (e.g., a parent or spouse). It is probable
that it is the degree of familiarity one has with a talker that enhances their ability to perceive

speech.

For example, Newman and Evers (2007) conducted a study employing a perceptual

shadowing task in which participants shadowed the speech of one talker while ignoring the

speech of a second talker. Similar to our current study, Newman and Evers’ familiar talker was

the participants’ Introductory Psychology instructor. In Experiment 1, the listeners were familiar

with the voice of talker to be shadowed and the results showed a talker-familiarity effect (i.e.

familiarity with the target talker significantly improved the listeners’ shadowing accuracy). In

Experiment 2, the listeners were familiar with the to-be-ignored talker’s voice and familiarity did
not affect the listeners’ shadowing accuracy—just as the listeners’ familiarity with the to-be-

ignored talker did not affect the magnitude of the ISE in the present study.

The processing requirements of ignoring a voice while shadowing one of two speech

streams is arguably similar to being asked to ignore a voice while remembering visually-

presented digits, and task similarities may explain the lack of a talker familiarity effect. The

emphasis on the overlap of the processing demands of the task and the to-be-ignored stimuli

within an ISE paradigm—and a speech shadowing task—fits with the duplex-model account of

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

auditory distraction, and specifically, the interference-by-process view of the changing-state
effect (Hughes, 2014). The current findings suggest that in these two experiments, the

precategorical features of auditory distraction were the dominant cause of the distraction
observed.

In this precategorical/postcategorical description of the duplex mechanism account

(Marsh et al., 2018), the lack of an effect of talker familiarity is not necessarily problematic for

the “functional” view of auditory distraction of Röer et al. (2017). The current stimuli were not

emotionally arousing as a result of their semantic context or the talker-specific information. It is

possible that if we increased the degree of familiarity our participants had with the to-be-ignored

voice even further (e.g., if the talker was the participants’ close friend or family member), the

talker-specific information may have affected the participants’ serial recall. Further manipulating
the concept of familiarity, and thus strengthening the potency of the postcategorical features in

future research, may ultimately give us both new insights into the “functional” view of auditory

distraction and how listeners utilize talker familiarity cues during everyday communication in
noisy listening environments.

These data also remind us that talker familiarity is a more vulnerable construct than once

thought (Drouin, Monto, & Theodore, 2017). Some researchers argue that it’s the role of
attention that seems to modulate said talker familiarity effects across a variety of speech

perception paradigms. In other words, “when processing time during retrieval is decoupled from
encoding factors, it fails to predict the emergence of talker-specificity effects. Rather attention

during encoding appears to be the putative variable.” (Theodore, Blumstein, & Luthra, 2015, p.
1674). This is known as the attention-driven specificity hypothesis (Maibauer, Markis, Newell,
& McLennan, 2014; Theodore et al., 2015). Our data from Experiment 1 support this

IRRELEVANT SPEECH FROM A FAMILIAR TALKER

perspective. It seems probable that during their Introductory Psychology class, students were not
attending to the instructor’s identity and voice characteristics (e.g., gender, shimmer, quality,

accent, etc.), rather their attentional resources were allocated to learning and understanding class
material. Because the students were not explicitly attending to (and encoding) the talker

characteristics of their instructor’s voice during class, when they participated in Experiment 1—
even those participants in the informed familiarity condition—they had few detailed, talker-

specific exemplars available for recall and subsequent interference (Church & Schacter, 1994).
Therefore, familiarity with the irrelevant speech’s talker had no significant effect on the

magnitude of the ISE. Our data from Experiment 2 counter this argument. In the future, if we
employed a similar design and ISE methodology, but trained the student participants to

document (i.e. actively attend to) specific vocal characteristics of their instructor during each
class and prior to the experiment, we may gain further insight into whether or not attention
allocation is driving talker-specific effects.

In summary, our study replicated the robust data already supporting the ISE but failed to

show a talker-specific effect of familiarity in the context of ISE. These data suggest that talker

familiarity is a more fragile construct than the speech perception literature originally suggested
(Drouin et al., 2017), while also supporting the interference-by-process view of the changing-

state effect (Hughes, 2014). Further research is needed to help resolve when talker-specific

information is perceived and utilized by the listener. This knowledge will be key to confirming
the theoretical explanations of the irrelevant speech effect and working toward a biologically
plausible theory of speech perception that includes both linguistic and indexical information.
