Burning the Haystack to Save the Needle: Dimension Reduction and Privacy in
Text and Network Data
Alexander Murray-Watters

Abstract
This poster presents results from applying a new dimension
reduction technique (UMAP) to a wide variety of data types,
ranging from online text to social networks, for the purpose
of creating useful, but anonymized, data. As the dimension
reduction procedure produces meaningful distances and supports arbitrary distance measures, it can be applied to a variety of problems, and produces data that is useful for both
visualization and predictive modeling. Included is a description of the dimension reduction procedure, the results of its
application, and a discussion of planned future use.

Proposed solution
This poster applies a dimension reduction procedure that
makes few assumptions and produces dimensions that have
meaningful distances – UMAP (McInnes and Healy 2018).
We can then use these new dimensions as anonymized data
within various analyses, including supervised learning (regression). As this kind of dimension reduction is lossy
(meaning it loses some information), the original data cannot
be completely recovered from the dimension reduced data.
This loss of data acts as an anonymization, in that some of
the identifying information is lost during the reduction.

A brief description of how UMAP works
How can we increase the difficulty of recovering the identity of individuals in a dataset, while still being able to make
use of the modified data? This problem is particularly difficult when dealing with online datasets, as easily searchable third-party information may be available, such as in the
Netflix prize case, where researchers managed to use IMDB
movie reviews to deanonymize individuals(Narayanan and
Shmatikov 2006). Deanonymization becomes an even more
difficult problem when social network data is taken into account, as even small changes to a social network (perhaps
done to preserve anonymity) can have serious implications
for analysis.
Previous attempts to ameliorate the problem of
deanonymization, such as the use of synthetic data,
focused on dealing with traditional rectangular datasets,
rather than text or social network data. Synthetic data
involves generating data that looks ”similar” to the original
data, but isn’t identical. The method usually assumes a
particular model, often only for a particular application
– say, a specific linear regression. Other methods involve
adding noise to the data, which is usually easier to reverse
than might be expected, and distributing a correlation matrix
instead of the raw data, which limits the kinds of variables
that can be anonymized. One of the most promising methods
for a general anonymization technique is −differential
privacy (which places a bound on the amount of privacy an
individual would lose by participating), which unfortunately
requires each individual is represented by a row in a dataset
(Heffetz and Ligett 2014), inhibiting its use with both
(social) network and text data.

Roughly, the UMAP procedure creates a unique distance
measure for every observation, calculates the distance between that observation and its n nearest neighbors, then
stitches the results together using ”fuzzy simplicial sets” so
that we can meaningfully talk about distance between the
different points. For an explanation of some of the background concepts involved, see (Awodey 2010). The procedure then performs its dimension reduction on this stitched
together space.
As the procedure’s run time increases with the number of
observations, not the number of variables, it is well suited to
high-dimensional problems, which we are likely to observe
in both text and social network datasets.
UMAP assumes:
1. Data are uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold (easiest to think of this as a Cartesian plane wrapped
around another object – e.g., a sphere). This is a nasty assumption, but we can get around it.
2. Our Riemannian metric (how we calculate distance on the
manifold) is locally constant (meaning, within a particular
’area’ we can calculate distance the same way).
3. Our manifold is locally connected (meaning we don’t
have a disconnect between two sections of the manifold
– e.g., someone hasn’t cut our sphere into two separate
pieces)
These are very weak assumptions as far as dimension reduction usually goes. It allows for non-linear relations, and
doesn’t assume a particular distribution – e.g., Gaussian.

We can also use many different distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, cosine distance, Hamming distance, etc), enabling
us to apply the procedure to a variety of different kinds of
data.

An example of applying UMAP to text data
We use the movie review dataset from the text2vec package (Selivanov 2016), which contains 5000 reviews of films
from IMDB, with a binary ”sentiment” variable denoting
film enjoyment, based off the numerical rating given (on a
scale from 1 to 10). A 0 sentiment implies a rating less than
5, while a 1 rating implies a rating greater than or equal to 7.
Converting the reviews to a bag-of-words representation
(i.e., a simple frequency count of each word in a review)
and removing stopwords (e.g., the, and, of) using the stopwords function from the tm R package (Meyer, Hornik, and
Feinerer 2008), yields a 5,000 row (review) by 7,522 column
(word) matrix:
After using UMAP to reduce this large matrix to 2 dimensions1 , we observe (Figure 1) that the dimension reduction
has preserved some of the differences in text between the binary sentiment categories. This is clear, in that the two categories have peak densities located in different locations in
the contour plots.
Now that we have a representation of text data that is both
continuous and computationally tractable, we can use our
dimension reduced data for classification (e.g., determining
the sentiment of a review via a generalized regression).
As there are many modeling options (any form of regression could be used), we opted for a GAM (generalized additive model) using spline smoothers (Wood 2017), as it
doesn’t assume linearity, produces an interpretable model
(unlike a neural network), and can handle categorical data.

As these dimensions have no straightforward interpretation,
they are only labeled as X1 and X2. Despite being not interpretable
by humans, they are still useful for prediction, as discussed later
with the generalized adaptive model.

Since this is a statistical model, we can also present our
model with new data and make predictions.
Model: sentiment ∼ s(X1 ) + s(X2 )
The resulting model has an R-square of 0.15, which increases to approximately .20 at 4 dimensions, and at 10 dimensions has an R-square of about .22, so while there is an
open question of how many dimensions should be extracted,
we are clearly extracting useful data. The two non-linear
components of GAM are visible in Figure 2. They depict
the spline smoothed X1 and X2 dimensions.

From text to networks
As the UMAP procedure is so general we can also apply it to
unusual kinds of data, like an adjacency matrix (Table 1) –
a way of representing a social network – by using Hamming
distance as our distance measure. This means we can apply
the technique to anonymize social network data.
As a proof of concept, here are two examples. When reduced to two dimensions, the well-known Zachary’s karate
club friendship network(Zachary 1977) results in almost
perfect separation between the two club factions. Figure 3
depicts a scatter plot of the dimension reduced adjacency
matrix, with a clear clustering of the two different factions,
with only a single person misclustered.
A smaller though also famous network of marriage ties
in Florence during the political competition between the
Medici and Oligarch political factions (Padgett and Ansell
1993), results in a less clear picture in Figure 4 (likely due to
the small number of nodes in the network). However, there
is a strong relationship between having a X2 value greater
than 2 and being a member of the Oligarch political faction.

This relationship reveals the preservation of useful network
data following the anonymization of the indiviual network
member’s ties, but it is no longer possible to identify which
members have marriage ties, only clusters of members.
We can now convert both text and social network data into
a reasonably anonymous format. Attempts to use the content
of, say, a tweet, to identify an individual should be extremely
difficult, as both the length and content of the tweet would
be unknown, and we can combine this representation with
network data that can’t be easily deanonymized.

recovering the original data actually is. We also need to
quantify just how reliable (and interpretable) the data from
running the procedure on a social network actually is. Later
work will also analyze the procedure’s robustness via simulations.

Possible issues and future work
By applying the UMAP procedure, we have now successfully anonymized both text and social network data in a form
that can be used by researchers as part of a regression or
other forms of analysis. This is the only known procedure
capable of anonymizing social network data without making
substantial and possibly misleading changes to the underlying network structure.
We are currently working on quantifying when the UMAP
procedure extracts enough information from the original
data to produce useful results. The procedure also cannot
be applied to data where the original variables are the focus of a study. That is, we can’t apply the procedure to age
and income if we want to study how income is related to
life span, as we could not disentangle the effect of age and
income from one another. This hinders the procedures’ applicability beyond text and social network data, as we often
are interested in the relationships between, say, demographic
variables.
Future work involves formally quantifying how difficult
