VOICE THROUGH CHOICE: EXPLORING A CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH GENDER
INEQUALITY MANIFESTS IN CONTRACEPTIVE USAGE OPTIONS

Abstract
Using data from the 2008 and 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Instrumental
Variables (IV) probit strategy, I estimate the effect of a wife’s negotiation power on the probability of a
wife choosing a “cooperative family planning method”1. The target sample chosen from the DHS survey
is the sample of all married women of reproductive age (15 – 49 years old) who are of the same age or
younger than their husbands. The instruments used was the difference in age and education between
husband and wife. IV probit results show that a unit increase in the “index of a wife’s negotiation power”
generates a 10-percentage point z-score increase in the probability of usage of a cooperative
contraceptive2 method, downwards from the 11-percentage point z-score increase from the probit results.
Further investigation shows heterogeneity across the 6 geopolitical regions of the country. Using the
North East region as the base sample, the highest difference between the IV probit and probit estimates
was in the North Central (0.007) and North West regions (0.03). This research was constrained by
unavailability of data to separate women that exclusively use a cooperative contraceptive from women
who exclusively use a non-cooperative family planning method. Hence, making the dependent variable
diluted by putting together wives who use both cooperative and non-cooperative methods. Another likely
explanation for results from the IV probit analysis is that factors affecting the usage of a “a cooperative
contraceptive method” are complex. These factors are influenced by a paradoxical society where there are
initiatives to end gender inequality the provision of contraceptive options targeted towards women is
being prioritized. Targeting contraceptive options and communications towards women entrenches the
1

Cooperative methods are those methods that require buy-in from the husband and wife before usage and pose no or
fewer health or one-sided burden on the woman (wife). They include withdrawal method, periodic method, male and
female condoms. (Note: All reference to woman in the text, are in reference to the woman as wife)

Throughout the paper contraceptives is used synonymously with family planning
1

expectation that preventing contraception is a role reserved for women. This paper argues that by creating
awareness about cooperative methods and making alternate contraceptives targeted towards men, there
will be balanced expectation and collaboration to choose methods that are cooperative. Those methods
would then be used effectively in preventing unwanted contraception by couples. This is pro-gender
equality and generates benefits such as better health and respect for women.
I.

Introduction

Various family planning options targeted towards women have side effects that range from mild to
deadly; from nausea to hormonal imbalance to the risk of blood clots. Considering that the act of sex
offers benefits to both parties, placing the burden of family planning on the wife does not maximize the
wife’s utility but gives a higher utility to the husband (negative externality problem). Kohler and
Thornton (2012) found that when men were given Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) to disincentivize
sex so as to not to contract HIV/AIDS in Malawi, the CCT was not associated with a decrease but
increase in sexual activity among men. Conversely, the CCT led to a decrease in sexual activity among
women.
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) could be either aggressive or subtle. Less attention is paid to the subtle
forms of violence because they sometimes go unnoticed or unreported. According to the WHO (2012),
the use of any family planning method against one’s will is sexually related coercion and a manifestation
of sexual violence against the woman. What happens when the will has been overtaken by society’s subtle
expectations? Rebekah Gee et al (2009) study reports that partner (male) creating difficulty for subject’s
(female) use of birth control was positively associated with reports of intimate partner violence. The paper
ends with the sad conclusion that passes the buck exclusively to women again:
“Contraception is more difficult to navigate for women experiencing IPV. Providers should
consider prescribing contraceptive methods for IPV victims that are not partner dependent.”

2

In addition, this also raises important questions of agency, “what a person is free to do and achieve in
pursuit of whatever goals or values he or she regards as important” (Amartya Sen (1985). Klugman and
Hanmer (2016) emphasize that agency in all its forms is critical for women’s empowerment. Salaam et al
(2006) findings are consistent with arguments that men who have violently abused their partners in the
past are more likely to react violently to a request for contraceptive use, especially condom use. Their
study reports that contraceptive use among abused women was significantly lower than the non-abused
women (p<0.01). Various studies cited by Salaam et al show associations between intimate partner
violence and unintended pregnancy. There may be more links between intimate partner violence and
unintended pregnancy than contraceptive usage rates among women and unintended pregnancy.
It is appalling that most studies give recommendations within the context of empowering women to
choose independently the methods that have these side effects and present arguments that that those
methods are better for the woman because she can take them independently. Whereas, trial versions of
contraceptives for men are quickly discarded because they have similar side effects as contraceptives for
women. Yet some men are not flexible to women choosing methods with no side effects, preferring that
women are manipulated into using all sorts of family planning drugs, injections and insertions through
various tactics, banking on society’s intended or non-intended role as an accomplice.
This research hopes to achieve a paradigm shift in presenting a new lens through which family planning
should be viewed by bringing to the front that the solution to intimate partner violence is not more
marketing of family planning medications to women but choosing methods that place less burden on the
woman as one of the measures through which intimate partner violence reduction initiatives success
should be assessed. Hopefully, this paper would also provide potential pathways to solutions to this
market failure problem despite its very systemic and entrenched nature.
The paper proceeds as follows: In Section I, I describe the hypothesis for this study and the mechanisms
that supports it. Section II presents probit regression estimates and describes the data used for the analysis

3

and some of its limitations. Section III proceeds with the IV probit analysis, describes the instruments
used and examines regional heterogeneity in IV probit estimates.

II.

Hypothesis

I hypothesize that difference in age and education between husband and wife negatively affects the ability
of a wife to negotiate the use a method that places less burden on her (referred to going forward as
“cooperative contraceptive methods”) with the husband and also her ability to discuss and take a stand on
issues without facing violent outcomes from the husband. This ability to negotiate then informs the choice
of contraceptive methods she ends up using. With higher ability to negotiate, she is more likely to use
cooperative contraceptive methods and use them successfully.
FIGURE I – HYPOTHESIZED CAUSAL PATHWAY OF INFLUENCE

This causal chain works through an underlying mechanism of powerlessness by the wife that is often
accentuated when she is younger or less educated than the husband. Also, societal and systemic factors in
most African societies even till this day apportion the blame for any “failures” in marriage on the wife. A
one-sided responsibility to avoid unwanted contraception is placed on the wife; “a proper woman should
know how to take care of herself”. A responsibility she’s not able to attain without buy in from her
husband and in the absence of this ends up choosing options that are more expensive and negative side
effects.

Probit Estimation
A. Data and Descriptive Statistics

The data set used for this study was extracted from the Individual Recode (IR) datafiles for the 2008 and
2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The IR data has data for all females interviewed
4

who are currently in union. The data set was pooled for two years, 2008 and 2013, so as to have enough
samples for the subset for analysis of interest. Data analysis focused on samples where the female
interviewed indicated that she is a wife.
The dependent variable was the choice of family planning method currently used by the wife. Family
planning methods were aggregated into two categories: cooperative and non-cooperative family planning
methods. For this purpose of this research, I define cooperative methods as those methods that require
buy-in from the husband and wife before usage and pose no or fewer health or one-sided burden on the
woman and non-cooperative methods as those methods that can be used by a woman with the man
playing no role in preventing unwanted contraception and often place higher fewer health or one-sided
burden on the woman. Family planning methods such as the Lactational Amenorrhea method were
dropped from the analysis because it is temporary non-choice-based method during lactation. Cooperative
family planning methods was coded as 1 and non-cooperative family planning methods as 0.
FIGURE I – COOPERATIVE AND NON-COOPERATIVE FAMILY PLANNING METHODS

The independent variable, an index of a wife’s negotiation power was calculated as the average of the zscore of the following dummy variables – wife can refuse sex (yes = 1), wife can ask husband to use a
condom (yes = 1), wife beating justified if wife argues with husband (no = 1), wife beating justified if
wife refuses sex (no = 1). The two latter variables were coded in the data set as yes = 1 but were recoded
as no = 1 during analysis so as to convert them into positive measures so they tally with the direction of
other variables of the measure of a wife’s negotiation power. An index calculated using the z-score was

5

favoured over an index that is a summation of variables because the interest was addressing impacts of
deviations from the observed average. Also observing the index as z-score rather than cumulative
measure provide better interpretative value. Therefore, the average of the z-scores for the earlier
mentioned dummy variables was calculated and are presented in Table I. The range of z-scores is widest
for the variable “beating justified for refusing sex” and most narrow for the variable “can ask condom”.
Although the correlation between the two justification for wife beating is 0.6, neither of the variables was
dropped.

Table II presents descriptive statistics for the main variables of interest. About 47.5 percent of our sample
currently use a cooperative family planning method. In the DHS questionnaire for Nigeria, this question is
a multiple response question (see APPENDIX I) and the DHS data file does not indicate if the woman
currently uses multiple methods because this response was coded in one column. Therefore, response is
streamlined to just one method, while there is evidence both from the questionnaire design and anecdotal
evidence that a woman may use multiple methods per time, combining both cooperative and noncooperative methods, for example, using pills and condoms, or periodic abstinence and spermicide jellies,
for dual contraceptive protection. The analysis would have been more targeted if there was data for
women using exclusively cooperative planning methods or a combination of cooperative family planning

6

methods only. However, using at least one of the cooperative family planning method shows a tilt in
preference to this method and an indicator that a woman is able to discuss sex with the partner in a way
that makes the use of this method is possible. Therefore, this provides a good proxy for usage of
cooperative methods. Knowledge of ovulation period, being of catholic region and living in rural area
were included as the main control variables. The ovulation period is midway between a woman’s
menstrual period. Within the number of days when a woman is ovulating is when she could get pregnant.
Therefore, knowledge of ovulation period is an important consideration and beginning point for a woman
interested in using cooperative family planning methods. During these periods, she might either decide to
abstain or use a condom. The DHS survey presented five options to the women asking them to indicate
which of the time specified was the ovulation period. Asking respondents directly if they knew their
ovulation period would generate positive responses higher than the actual from women who may be
embarrassed that they do not know saying yes, they do. A dummy variable was generated for this
categorical variable with correct response coded as 1 and all other responses coded as 0. The percentage
of women who got this question correctly was 31.7 percent. In Rebekah Gee et al (2009) study in
Philadelphia, similar method was used in asking this question and about 50 per cent indicated the right
response. The fact that not all women know when they are most fertile is an indication there is inadequate
focus on contraceptive methods dependent on this knowledge causing less attention to be paid to it. Also,
knowing one’s ovulation could be of no consequence if the time of sex is externally and independently
determined by the man. If respondent is catholic was also included as a control variable because strict
adherents to catholic religion favour most of the options identified as cooperative methods. Not including
this as a control would bias our estimate upwards. Rural areas are also more likely to use a cooperative
planning method because the methods are free or relatively less costly or because the health facility to
obtain some of the non-cooperative family planning methods is inaccessible. 5.4 to 6.6 percent of the
sample was from the North East and North West region respectively. This does not signify an under
representation for some regions. DHS surveys are randomized and sample per region is based on
population of those areas so as to make possible nationwide estimations. Although the DHS also makes
7

region specific estimations for survey variables, having larger samples in these regions especially for
analysis using a subset of the total sample could help with generating more significant findings for
researchers. The difference in age and total years of education between husband and wife was used to
instrument for the independent variable. The reason for this choice and proof of validity of instruments
would be discussed in section III.

B. Probit Estimates
Table III reports probit estimates of the relationship between a wife’s use of a cooperative family
planning method and index of wife’s negotiation power. The baseline estimating equation is:
Ci = Pβ +Xβ1 +εi

equation (1)

Ci denotes usage of a cooperative family planning method, P denotes index of a wife’s negotiation power,
β is the estimated coefficient of the effect of wife’s negotiation power on the usage of cooperative family

8

planning method, β1 is the vector of unknown parameters, X denotes the vector of exogenous variables
representing the control variables and εi represents the error term in the equation.
The regression without control variables in column I show that a one unit increase in the z-score of index
of woman’s negotiation power is associated with a 11-percentage point increase in the probability of
usage of a cooperative family planning method. Although most probit coefficients are small in magnitude,
they are statistically significant. The coefficient for South East region has the largest magnitude; being in
the South East is associated with a 48-percentage point increases in the probability that a woman’s uses a
cooperative family planning method compared to the North East (the base region).

Probit Estimation

However, index of a woman’s negotiation power is not randomly assigned. It is determined also by other
unobservable variables in our error term, therefore, omitted variables bias is a concern. For example, the
level of sensitization or marketing of specific family planning methods could vary. This means the
correlation between the regressors and the error term is not zero (E (X, u) ≠ 0), and the results of the
probit estimation are inconsistent. I am also concerned about reverse causality; a woman's usage of a
cooperative family planning method could be as a result of her ability to negotiate or it could be that her
ability to negotiate makes it possible for her to use a cooperative family planning method. Measurement
error could also be a concern because I do not have data for wifes that exclusively use cooperative family
planning methods. Existing data is a good proxy because this is applicable to all the samples surveyed.
A. Difference in age and education between husband and wife
I instrument for index of a wife’s negotiation power using two instruments; difference in age and
difference in total years of education between husband and wife. These instruments satisfy both the
conditional independence and exclusion restriction assumptions. They are not related to other factors in
our error term (cov(z, u)=0). Any couple irrespective of age or education difference can choose or use
either methods of family planning. The instruments impacts method used, only through their influence on
a wife’s negotiation power. The Wald test of exogeneity has a Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 for all IV probit
regressions (see TABLE 5) showing that our instruments are relevant (cov(x,z)≠0).

B. IV Probit estimates
Equation (1) describes the relationship between usage of cooperative method of family planning and
index of a wife’s negotiation power. In addition, I estimate the effect of the instruments on the
independent variable:
Ii= α1z1+ α2z2+ µi

equation (2)

Ii denotes index of a wife’s negotiation power, z1 denotes the difference in age between husband and wife,
α1 is the estimated coefficient of z1 on Ii, z2 denotes the difference in education between husband and wife,
α2 is the estimated coefficient of z2 on Ii, and µi represents the error term.
However, for all IV probit regression coefficients, the estimates are slightly lower than the probit
estimates.

C. Heterogeneity in IV probit estimates
It is possible that differences between region balance each other out resulting in similar probit and IV
probit estimates. To test this assumption, I estimate the relationship between our main variables in the
regions using:

Cj = Pjβj +εi

equation (4)

Cj denotes usage of a cooperative family planning method in region, Pj denotes index of a wife’s
negotiation power in the region, βj is the estimated coefficient of the effect of wife’s negotiation power
on the usage of cooperative family planning method in the region, and εi represents the error term in the
equation.
Compared to coefficients in column (1) of TABLE 5 (the IV probit estimates table), where index of
wife’s negotiation for the whole sample is 0.100 (0.034)***. Table 6 serves two purposes to compare
probit and ivprobit analysis between regions and to also compare IV probit coefficient of the main
regression for the total sample with that of the regions. Table 7 shows that only the North Central and
South East regions has coefficients only marginally higher than the probit ((0.100) or IV probit estimates
(0.111). However, our instrument is weak in four out of the six regions (indicated in red – TABLE 7) and
coefficients are only statistically significant in the North East.

Perhaps there are so many unobservable and exogenous factors that inform the choice of usage of
cooperative family planning methods versus non-cooperative family planning methods, that makes this
choice as good as random and makes the IV identification strategy of less value because there are no
observable variables that are truly exogenous. For example, irrespective of difference in age or education,
some men might just be more considerate and disciplined than some men due to some in-utero shocks or
factors in upbringing. Or perhaps, the culture of masculinity as being fertile and the number of children a
man has being a sign of virility make the husband not want to choose a cooperative method because it
counters this desire to show off his virility and even when wife chooses to use a non-cooperative method,
she does this surreptitiously.
Attempts was also made to explore further heterogeneity focusing on difference in age and years of
education. Among these two groups, there was an even split between the use of cooperative versus noncooperative methods – 59.7 percent among same age husband and wife and 48.7 percent among husband
and wife with the same number of years of education. Probit and IV probit estimates of husband and wife
of same age also show lower IV probit estimates. Same for Probit and IV probit estimates of husband and
wife with equal number of years of education (APPENDIX IV). Being above or below median age not
explored because this is an individual (unit) level choice and a group (survey) average not likely to offer
much insight.

Conclusion

In the literature, most non-cooperative family planning methods are described as “modern methods,”
while most cooperative family planning methods are defined as “traditional methods.” In a world and
especially in developing countries where modernization is a catchy proposition, it would not be strange to
find a husband imposing a modern method on the wife in the spirit of modernization just so as to avoid
cooperative methods. This power relations merely mirror the values and inequalities of society. Even the
DHS survey categorizes family planning methods along this divide. As reiterated throughout this paper,
the focus on non-cooperative family planning methods shows how systemic and entrenched into the fabric
of society the expectation of the woman as the “contraceptive consumer”. Even pharmaceuticals prioritize
research into family planning for women because they choose to be convinced that men would not
purchase family planning medications. This situation begs the question, “where is the much-heralded
global international development commitment to gender equality and female empowerment?” Shouldn’t
we be taking this commitment a step ahead by incentivizing the production and marketing of family
planning methods exclusively for men, emphasizing all family planning methods, especially cooperative
family planning methods. So that men and women who do not want to use contraceptives exclusively
targeted towards them, can perhaps, find a compromise and work towards making cooperative family
planning methods be a win-win for them.
