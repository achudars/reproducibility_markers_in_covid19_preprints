"4" "Given that translational research (TR) aims at changing regulatory and organizational practices in the biomedical field, surprisingly little is known about how those who are actually supposed to practice translation in the lab or the clinic think about it. Addressing this gap, we present results from a q-methodological study on the meanings and values associated with translation h eld by researchers and clinicians  at two major German biomedical research   institutions implementing  TR  strategies.  We id entify eight different collective understandings of translation in practice, with respect to both where primary translation al problems are located and what the most immediate and effective measures should be.  Our findings  suggest that there may not be a one-fits-all solution for improving translation and that general regulatory and organizationa l measures may be less effective than measures addressing specific audiences and their specific viewpoints."

"7" "Introduction"
"8" "Translational research (TR) has become a dominant frame in discussing the reorganization of medical research and innovation. Its starting point is a problematization of current practices in the health care innovation system, particularly regarding the transitions, or ‘translations,’ between basic research, clinical research and public health care. We will therefore distinguish between  translation  as a (potential or actual)  practice  – e.g. of 'turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions’ (Austin 2018, 1) – and  TR  as a  frame , or  reflection  on why translation matters and how it should be improved. As such, TR provides a ‘diagnostic of well-discussed “crisis situations” in biomedical innovation systems’  ( V i g n o l a - G a g né, Biegelbauer, and Lehner 2014, 133f ) . Expressions of this problematization can be found, for example, in framings such as ‘research waste’ (Chalmers et al. 2014;  C h a l m e r s   a n d Glasziou 2009)  or the ‘valley of death’ ( B u t l e r   2 0 0 8 ) ."
"9" "TR’s proposed solution to such problems is the improved translation ‘from bench to bedside’, often appended by an ‘and beyond’ as well as an ‘and back’ clause  ( B a u e r   2 0 1 5 ; Holzinger et al. 2015; Laan and Boenink 2015; Schully, Benedicto, and Khoury 2012; Hörig and Pullman 2004 ) . Targeting the whole process from observations an inventions in basic research to clinical trials to innovations in therapeutic development to the latter’s diffusion into national and global health care systems as well as all potential feedback loops between any of these points, “much of the TR rationale is aimed explicitly at change in the governance of biomedical innovation systems rather than techno–scientific change alone”  ( V i g n o l a - G a gné, Biegelbauer, and Lehner 2014, 134) ."
"10" "What exactly this is supposed to entail remains surprisingly vague, however. ‘Ask ten people what translational research means and you’re likely to get ten different answers’ (Butler  2 0 0 8 ,   8 41) . Unsurprisingly, a coherent definition of TR is missing; different and at times conflicting views persist on how to address translation in regulatory and organizational practices (Blümel et al. 2016; Blümel et al. 2015 ; Krüger et al. in press).  Given that TR aims at changing such practices, little investigation has occurred into what translation means for those who are actually supposed to perform translation in their everyday practices."
"11" "We address this gap by presenting results from a study on the meanings and values associated with translation held by researchers and clinicians from different positions between bench and bedside in the German biomedical field. First, we situate our research in the current debate on TR and its lack of studying translation as a practice embedded in a variety of collective understandings and values. We then outline the q methodological approach taken to investigate these different viewpoints as well as the data used. The heart of the article consists of the presentation and interpretation of the views of practitioners on the two main questions we asked: Which transition stages do they think of as particularly critical? Which measures do they think are more or less suitable for improving translation? We find four distinct viewpoints for each question (eight in total), confirming that understandings of translation are highly diverse among clinicians and researchers. Contradictory viewpoints are prevalent among the respondents with respect to where primary translational problems are located and with respect to what the most immediate and effective measures should be. These results suggest that most attempts at improving translation will concurrently generate support and opposition from practitioners in the clinic and in the lab. In effect, regulatory and organizational measures that address translational issues in general might be less effective than those that address specific audiences and their specific viewpoints. The article closes with a discussion of the different viewpoints in the context of the broader TR debate."
"12" "Studying translation as practice"
"13" "For more than two decades, the debate on TR has grown in size and scope and led to institutional and organizational changes around the world. While key terms such as ‘translation’ or ‘translational research’ are widely used in this debate, a common understanding of such terms is often missing. TR remains a contested matter. Different and at times conflicting views persist on the sort of problem TR seeks to address, and hence on the question which regulatory and organizational practices are needed to make translation work."
"14" "Attempts of conceptualizing the translational process have produced a number of models, which differ in the way they depict flows and transitions of knowledge. Whereas most models start at the site of basic research and describe transitions from ‘bench to bedside’, some extend the process beyond the bedside all the way to improved public health and some posit multi-directional flows of knowledge. Reviewing the development of such process models, Blümel et al. (2015, 30)  identify two basic tendencies, which have developed over time: ‘(1) an ongoing expansion of the TR process to encompass more and more aspects, particularly in the context of clinical practice and public health, and (2) a subsequent increase in the number of translational phases (T) within the proposed process models’."
"15" "The TR debate started as a problematization of the disconnection between the promise of basic science and the delivery of better health, related to crises narratives such as the ‘valley of death’, the pharmaceutical ‘productivity crisis’ or ‘research waste’ (Chalmers et al. 2014; Vignola-Gagné et al. 2014;  Mittra 2013;  Chalmers and Glasziou 2009; Butler 2008; Cockburn 2006; Zerhouni 2003; Sung et al. 2003). The Clinical Research Roundtable (CRR), installed in 2000 to discuss the challenges facing clinical research, identified two major ‘translational blocks’ that impede efforts to apply science to better human health: T1) ‘the transfer of new understandings of disease mechanisms gained in the laboratory into the development of new methods for diagnosis, therapy, and prevention and their first testing in humans’, and T2) ‘the translation of results from clinical studies into everyday clinical practice and health decision making’ (Sung et al. 2003, 1279)."
"16" "Subsequent models refined and expanded this basic linear logic, for example by describing three or four translational gaps, rather than two, or by including feedback loops (Drolet and Lorenzi 2011; Rubio et al. 2010; Dougherty and Conway 2008; Woolf 2008; Westfall et al. 2007). Commenting on the initial CRR model, Woolf (2008, 212) noted not only that ‘T1 and T2 face different challenges’ but also that ‘T1 seems to over-shadow T2 in the United States’ while ultimately ‘T2 could save more lives than T1’. Emphasizing the role of practice-based research, e.g. in Phase 3 and 4 trials, Westfall et al. (2007) proposed a three-step model by introducing an altered T2 transition from humans to patients and a new T3 transition from patients to practice. Rubio et al. (2010, 474) later introduced a circular and bidirectional three-step model, suggesting that ‘translational research moves in a bidirectional manner from one type of research to another – from basic research to patient-oriented research, to population-based research, and back – and involves collaboration among scientists from multiple disciplines’. In an attempt to summarize existing models and to harmonize terminology, Drolet and Lorenzi (2011, 3) introduced the ‘zone of translation’ as a concept that denotes ‘the sum of activities that must occur to reach health impact’, including the previously described transitions T1, T2, or T3."
"17" "All the above mentioned contributions address the question  from where to where  knowledge should be translated. A second and related question is  how  knowledge can be successfully translated from science to practice. Multiple answers have been given to this question and the organizational response to the challenge of TR has been diverse ( Blümel et al. 2016 ). Measures that have been discussed or implemented in order to improve translation include investments in research infrastructure and education, incentives for interdisciplinary collaboration and better research quality, standards and guidelines, and more institutional support for bridging agents, such as clinician scientists ( Hendriks et al. 2019;  WR 2016; Daye et al. 2015; DFG 2015;  Vignola-Gagné 2013;  Rey-Rocha and Martín-Sempere 2012; Zerhouni 2007; Glasgow et al. 2004; Zerhouni 2003)."
"18" "Implementation studies are still rare and little is known on how such measures are viewed by those affected, i.e. the researchers and clinicians supposed to do translation in their daily work  (Hendriks et al. 2019; Rushforth and de Rijcke 2016; Rey-Rocha and Martín-Sempere 2012) . An exception is the field of nursing studies, which has produced a number of studies on the implementation of evidence-based practice, also with regards to TR (Brownson et al. 2017; Kristensen et al. 2016; Kueny et al. 2015; Pols 2014; Burke and Getlin 2012; Green et al. 2009; Chesla 2008; Titler et al. 2007). This literature puts a strong emphasis on practice and context.  Burke and Gitlin (2012, e85), for example, suggest  that translating research ‘ is more than a matter of disseminating the information to practitioners and expecting immediate change in patient treatment’ and instead ‘will require a focused understanding of the particular setting where change is warranted’ (Burke and Gitlin 2012, e85). Chesla (2008, 383) proposes to employ ‘interpretative/qualitative methods’ in order to understand context conditions and ‘examine factors that stand in the way of translating basic science into practice’."
"19" "However, as is in the name, this literature focusses on the implementation rather than the production of knowledge and generally assumes that we already ‘have the evidence’ (Burke and Gitlin 2012, e85). Whereas this view may be understandable from the perspective of nursing studies, we suggest widening the focus to give equal consideration to the contextual shaping of practices at all stages of the translation process, including basic and clinical science. Rather than surveying practitioners at ‘the end’ of the process, if and how they implement evidence produced by others, we like to ask how researchers and practitioners alike view and evaluate translational practices along the full continuum, or circle, from bench to bedside to public health and back. And as Chesla (2008, 383) notes, ‘Interpretive approaches are valid routes for generating knowledge for practice at every stage of the translational process’."
"20" "Following Schatzki (2001, 11), we identify practices as ‘embodied, materially mediated arrays of human activity centrally organized around shared practical understanding’. Translation, at whatever stage and in whatever form, will be realized in a field of interwoven practices. To study and evaluate the doing of translation, we must therefore attend to how translation is performed in a web of interwoven practices, their development, transformation, and contexts."
"21" "As a first step in this direc tion, we interviewed 78 practitioners between bench and bedside  at two German biomedical institutions,  the Charité and the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC),  on  how they view translation, focussing on both the  where  and  how  of translation. We asked them two questions:"
"22" "RQ1:  Where in the translational process, at which particular transition stage, do you see obstacles?"
"23" "RQ2:  How, by which regulatory and organizational measure, should these obstacles be overcome?"
"24" "Data and Methods"
"25" "Our study design is based on Q methodology and combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Q methodology originated in the field of psychology as a tool for the identification and interpretation of typical viewpoints, discourses, or tastes in a social group (Watts and Stenner 2012; Brown 1980;  S t e phenson 1935 ). It has since been widely applied in the social sciences, including social studies of health and illness (Dziopa and Ahern 2011; Malia and Bennett 2011;  A k h tar-Danesh, Baumann, and Cordingley 2008; Barker 2008;  Thompson et al. 2001a; 2001b) , often with the linked goal of addressing practical matters such as the acceptance or evaluation of new (organizational) polices. We use Q methodology here to study the meanings and values associated with translation held by researchers and clinicians from different positions on the bench and bedside spectrum."
"26" "Q methodology builds on a factor analysis or principal component analysis (PCA) performed on a tilted matrix, where the rows hold variables and the columns represent subjects. However, rather than studying correlations between variables, as in factor analysis or PCA, Q methodology looks for correlations between subjects across a sample of variables – the evaluation of statements regarding translation in our case. Q methodology also goes beyond (reversed) factor analysis or PCA in that it is not just a mathematical algorithm but an encompassing research methodology, including its own theory of subjectivity, sampling strategy, and way of mixing quantitative and qualitative data ( W a t t s   a n d   S tenner 2012) ."
"27" "Typically, a Q methodological study consists of three main tasks. Given a particular topic and related research question, the first task is to gather a set of items representative of the so-called ‘concourse’, i.e. the full range of expressions or concerns on the research topic. Then, in a second task, respondents are asked to sort that set of items into a bell-shaped grid along a one-dimensional metric scale, e.g. to sort a set of statements (items) according to personal agreement (scale). After sorting, respondents are interviewed about their particular reasons for sorting the items the way they did. The final task is to calculate factors or components over the finished item sorts and interpret them as expressions of typical viewpoints with the help of the qualitative interview data. We went about these three tasks in the following way."
"28" "Constructing the set of statements"
"29" "For each of our two research questions, we constructed a distinct set of statements (see Table 1). The first set, relating to RQ1, consists of 24 statements about possible transition stages between two points, e.g. the transition from phase 1 to phase 2 studies or the transition from public health to basic research. The second set, relating to RQ2, consists of 53 statements, each representing a possible measure to improve biomedical translation. Each item was randomly assigned to a numeric identifier to be used in the calculation of the Q components."
"30" "[Table 1 about here]"
"31" "To ensure that sets 1 and 2 are broadly representative of the underlying concourses on the ‘where’ and ‘how’ of biomedical translation, respectively, we collected the statements for both questions on the basis of an in-depth literature analysis of 345 scientific articles (retrieved through PubMed), 16 policy papers (retrieved online), and 32 semi-structured interviews (lasting between 15 and 60 minutes) with researchers, clinicians, clinician scientists and administrative staff a t   the Charité and the MDC . For both questions we started out with a large set and gradually reduced the number of items to a point where we felt to have struck a good balance between diversity and redundancy."
"32" "For each set, we created an enlarged grid printed on a poster, containing as many cells as items in the set and approximating a bell-shape curve. We also created two sets of paper cards containing the items and matching the cell size in the corresponding grids. The posters and cards were used in the interviews to facilitate the sorting process."
"33" "Sampling and interviewing respondents"
"34" "To perform Q methodology, the sample of respondents does not need to be large or representative of the population. What matters is that the sample of respondents is diverse in the sense that it includes various viewpoints of interest ( W a t t s   a n d   S tenner 2012) . Also, Q methodology is not concerned with determining what proportions of a given population belongs in one factor/component or another, since its aim is only to identify, understand and interpret particular viewpoints ( B r o w n   1 9 8 0 ) . There is no agreement on the ratio of respondents to items, although some authors suggest that the sample of respondents should be smaller than the sample of items ( W a t t s   a n d   S tenner 2012) ."
"35" "We used a strategic approach to sample the respondents for our study. Our rationale was to find respondents who are situated differently in the translational process because we expected them to express different viewpoints on our research questions. In total, we interviewed 78 people  at  the Charité and the MDC .   Table 2 shows the distribution of numbers of participants for five strategically chosen categories: sex, type of institution, position on the bench-bedside continuum, status and focus area. Table  3  gives an overview of the transcripts cited in this text."
"36" "All respondents were identified by browsing the official institutional websites with our strategic sampling approach. We got formal ethical approval for our study from both institutions. The interviews were conducted between 2016 and 2017 and lasted between 90 and 120 minutes each. The research was explained to the respondents during the contact phase and again at the beginning of the interviews."
"37" "All but one respondent completed at least one of the two sorting tasks (70 completed the first and 76 completed the second task). The main reasons for cancelling a sorting task were time constraints (mainly regarding the second task) and unfamiliarity with the question (mainly regarding the first task)."
"38" "After instructing the respondents on how to sort the cards in the poster grids, we asked them to begin each task by first dividing the set of items into three provisional ranking categories (positive, negative, and neutral feelings towards the item in question), following a procedure to ease the cognitively demanding task of sorting a large number of items suggested in Watts and Stenner ( 2 0 1 2 ) . We then asked our respondents to start with either the positive or the negative pile and again identify only those items they feel most positive/negative towards. This way, the respondents were able to fill each grid starting from its extreme poles and working their way up to the middle, being allowed to reorder any of the statements at any time.  When finished with the sorting task, we asked respondents in semi-structured interviews to explain their choices, particularly to identify difficulties and ambiguities within the sorting process. The interview transcripts were used to triangulate the sorting data."
"39" "[Tables 2 and 3 about here]"
"40" "Calculating and interpreting typical viewpoints"
"41" "As a preparation for calculating the Q components, we transcribed the sorting order of cards in the grids into a dataset using the cards’ numeric identifiers. To calculate the components, we employed a PCA followed by Varimax rotation as implemented in the  qmethod  package written in R ( Z a b a l a   2 0 1 4 ) . Since no predefined criteria tell us how many components to extract in a PCA, we based our decision on the number of components on a quantitative analysis of eigenvalues and explained variance in combination with a qualitative assessment of possible interpretations of the resulting components (Zabala 2014;   W a t t s   a nd Stenner 2012) . For the interpretation of the components we used the qualitative data generated during the interviews, focussing especially on the accounts of sorters who scored high on the component in question. We also made use of the so-called ‘crib sheet’ ( W a t t s   a n d   S tenner 2012) , a tool for comparison of the relative rankings of items in each component. All components were discussed and verified in group sessions."
"42" "Watts and Stenner (2012) advocate a ‘holistic’ approach to the interpretation of the components, arguing that ‘the  whole viewpoint  is, and has always been, our primary concern’ (149). According to the authors, this means focussing on the whole item configuration rather than restricting oneself to the limited items that occupy particularly high or low rankings. Besides cross-factor item comparisons, the authors stress that the interpretation should be driven by an account of the interrelationship of all items  within  a component."
"43" "While this methodological approach sounds appealing in theory, we found it difficult to follow in practice. First, we found that high- and low-ranking items with high statistical distinguishing power in terms of cross-component comparison were indeed most helpful for interpreting the component as a whole. Second, we assume that there is at least some noise in our data, a point Watts and Stenner largely ignore when they write that the ‘entire item configuration’ must be explained as ‘a most surprising fact’ (149). Especially in our second sorting task, we found that some items were non-distinguishing for any component and we saw no point in attempting to interpret why certain statistically insignificant items were ranked, say, 1 rather than 2 or the other way around."
"44" "Instead, we asked what items that were non-distinguishing for most or all components are indicative of. Aiming at mapping the meanings and values in the still-emerging field of translational research, we found our results helpful for identifying both differentiating and shared viewpoints, the latter of which, admittedly, are not a usual concern in Q methodology. We will reflect on this circumstance further in the discussion part."
"45" "Different viewpoints on where and how translation should be improved"
"46" "For both Q sets, we arrived at a four-component solution. The total explained variance is 55.8 % for the first set and 42.1 % for the second set. Note that for the first set, we needed to reduce the number of q sorts (respondents included in the analysis) to 55, because otherwise the determinant of the smoothed correlation would have been zero, making the results uninterpretable. We thus removed 15 randomly chosen Q sorts from the analysis but taking care that each of our strategically chosen categories was still represented in the reduced set."
"47" "The ‘where’ of translation"
"48" "Viewpoint #1: ‘Conventional medicine’"
"49" "The first viewpoint sees biomedical translation as an incremental and structured process of knowledge transfer and accounts for 22% of the total variance. The respondents associated with this viewpoint rank highest transitions belonging to the conventional phases of clinical research (A05, A22, A01, A19). They argue that the transitions from phase 1 to phase 2 to phase 3 to drug approval to phase 4 were “an already well-structured process…no problems there” (ta16), even “a logical process” (tf25)."
"50" "The emphasis on structuredness can also be inferred when looking at the other pole of the sorting spectrum.Transitions beyond bedside – from or into public health care, that is – are ranked lowest (A21, A06, A17, A13, A09). In the field of public health care, respondents associated with this viewpoint argue, “we lack predefined structures to work with” (ta16). The development of new drugs or methods and their application in public health care were “just so far away from each other, which is why translation becomes pretty difficult there” (tf25)."
"51" "Viewpoint #2: ‘Basic research as bottleneck’"
"52" "The second viewpoint sees basic research as the bottleneck of successful translation and explains 13.6% of the total variance. The respondents associated with this viewpoint rank highest transitions from and to basic research (A21, A21, A16, A08, A18). As one respondent explains:"
"53" "‘ For me, translation means bringing together basic natural scientists with clinicians and medical personnel. “We have this and that idea”, and then the clinician responds: “but that doesn’t work out in the clinical context”. Or the other way around. The clinician has a problem and doesn’t know how to continue, and the basic researcher has an idea: “What about those receptors or those genetic mechanisms?”’ (ta13)"
"54" "Backward transitions are ranked positively in this viewpoint. Not only clinicians report back and thereby stimulate basic research, backward transitions can also be driven by regulatory attention: “in widespread diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Diabetes we have large patient groups and we know the risk factors, plus it’s important for the state to have them researched in basic research, so a lot of money is invested into this” (ta21)."
"55" "Since this viewpoint’s focus is on the pivotal role of basic research, it ranks transitions at other stages of the process lower, including some of the conventional phases of clinical research, such as phase 2 to phase 3 to approval to phase 4 (A04, A10, A05, A13, A22)."
"56" "Viewpoint #3: ‘model-based research’"
"57" "The third viewpoint holds controlled model l ing work done in basic research as the driver of translation and innovation and explains 11.5% of the total variance. Among the top-ranked items are all the transitions between basic research, pathophysiology/disease model l ing, developing therapies in a model, and developing methods and technologies (A08, A15, A02, A03, A12). ‘the most valuable insights come from basic research’ (ta13), the respondents belonging to this viewpoint argue, ‘simulations, be it  in vivo  or  in vitro … this is where you can address cell cultures or animal models with your questions and see what really comes out of it’ (tf32)."
"58" "Transitions at stages further away from the model l ing work done in basic research are ranked lower. The lowest ranked items (A21, A22, A05, A09, A10) include those from public health – i.e. ‘furthest away’, seen from this viewpoint – back to basic research. As our respondents explain: ‘public health is just very far away and results only in very generic specifications for basic research…in most cases, if there is a new high wave of influence, nobody will change basic research’ (tf37). Translation at later stages is also seen hampered because of a lack of interest and money. On the one hand, ‘Big Pharma often decides erratically where to invest money, so as a basic researcher you cannot continue further if they don’t move’ (tf13). On the other hand, ‘How many countries around the world are interested in public health? We can name the EU. I have my doubts concerning North America…and then the rest of the world?...if you don’t have money, you’re screwed!’ (tf32)."
"59" "Viewpoint #4: ‘Clinical research as bottleneck’"
"60" "The fourth viewpoint in the first sorting task is characterized by seeing clinical research as the bottleneck of successful translation and explains 8.7% of the total variance. In contrast to the first viewpoint, respondents associated with the fourth viewpoint do not rank all transitions belonging to the conventional phases of clinical research equal, nor even particularly high. The top-ranked items rather include transitions from and to clinical research as a whole (A18, A23, A04, A07). Accordingly, ‘big leap’ transitions from before to after bedside are ranked low (A08, A06, A13, A07)."
"61" "Two main hurdles involving clinical research are identified at the negative pole of the ranking order. First, the transition from the (animal) model to humans (A20): ‘A large number of factors have to point in the same direction before you can actually test something in humans, in phase 1. I experience this step as something strongly regulated, and it’s good that this is not so easy’ (tf17). The second perceived hurdle is the transition from phase 3 to approval (A05): ‘Phase 3 studies…what an administrative burden to have a drug approved, which is why only pharma biotech companies can do this. Impossible in a university setting’ (ta24). Strikingly, while these hurdles roughly correspond to the ‘innovation’ and ‘implementation’ gaps identified in previous research  ( B l ü m e l   e t   a l. 2015) , they are framed by this viewpoint as primarily regulatory and administrative rather than epistemic in nature."
"62" "The ‘how’ of translation"
"63" "Viewpoint #1: ‘A culture of translation’"
"64" "The first viewpoint emerging from the second sorting task thinks that translation can best be improved by forming a translational culture, which builds on interdisciplinarity, mutual understanding, physical proximity to relevant actors, and a translational education and accounts for 12% of the total variance (B08, B12, B01, B11, B48). ‘The bottleneck of all translation is interdisciplinarity’ (ta01), respondents associated with this viewpoint contend, ‘either you got a scientist who represents the interface, or you put more effort in encouraging the direct exchange between basic researchers and clinicians’ (tb12)."
"65" "At the negative end of the ranking spectrum, we find measures about the participation of nurses and patients in the research process (B15, B44), economic aspects (B21, B42) and the establishment of new journals (B43). However, these statements rank low in all our components, and are not statistically distinguishing for the first component. Two statistically distinguishing items, publishing ( B34 ) and comparative studies ( B47 ), rank low, but since they are not in the lower extreme, we are lacking qualitative material to further interpret them."
"66" "Viewpoint #2: ‘Better working conditions’"
"67" "The second viewpoint holds that more financial, time, and human resources were needed to improve translational processes and explains 11% of the total variance. Successful translation is seen as something that can only emerge if the people doing it feel secure in terms of resources and general appreciation. As one respondent states:"
"68" "‘ Creating more time for research and long-term support, these are my biggest everyday problems. For me this is quite personal. I never have time for research, so I do this in my freetime, on the weekends or in the evenings...This is why things take so long…and then…many scientists work on temporary contracts…three months, six months, one year, two years…no perspectives offered but a lot of pressure to deliver. I find this paralyzing and believe that, in this way, ideas, also grand ideas, cannot be implemented or even thought of in the first place’ (tf15)."
"69" "Consequently, respondents associated with this viewpoint disapprove of both supporting economically promising research (B21) and hiring for excellence (B06):"
"70" "‘ Based on fear, you have to steer research in a direction that looks promising. This is not a good basis, though. It can lead to a situation where you declare something as translational where it’s really not, just to please your sponsors’ (tf35),"
"71" "‘ Not enough is done to support and keep scientists who are here and have done a lot, but they rather fire ten people to recruit ten new high-potentials, so that they can write in their newsletter: “We got this person from Harvard and that person from Oxford”’ ( tf35 )"
"72" "Viewpoint #3: ‘Standards and tools’"
"73" "The third viewpoint is characterized through its emphasis on standards and tools as preferred solutions to the problem of translation and explains 11% of the total variance. The implementation of better quality standards and guidelines (B50, B33, B36) is seen as a suitable way to facilitate interdisciplinarity (B08, B12). “If one sets good quality standards, it becomes easier to compare things between places, which is very, very important. Otherwise, some say it works and others say it doesn’t work” (tf10), respondents associated with this viewpoint argue. This includes publication of negative results as well: “People and humanity as a whole would benefit if the things that did not work or did not have an effect, or a negative one, were published nonetheless” (tb09)."
"74" "Databases and technology platforms (B14, B39) are also ranked significantly higher than in the other three viewpoints. Their benefit, again, lies in standardization: “Our screening unit includes really large databases of FDA approved drugs, which you don’t normally have in the lab…also they have robots there, which make sure that measurements are more automated…and just think about how often you have to repeat these things” (ta11)."
"75" "At the negative end of the spectrum, respondents associated with this viewpoint rank physical proximity (B48): “Physical proximity? I don’t know, maybe you are closer to each other then, but you still don’t talk. You’d have to facilitate communication not proximity” (tb09). This underlies the viewpoint’s emphasis on standards and tools – rather than on spontaneous exchange – as the key mechanism of coordination."
"76" "Viewpoint #4: ‘Embodied excellence’"
"77" "The fourth viewpoint holds that translation can best be achieved through embodied excellence and accounts for 8% of the total variance. The key to successful translation lies in the gifted minds of individual scientists and their ability to choose the right questions and approaches (B06, B02, B04, B38), rather than in a particular culture, a stream of resources, or the introduction of tools and standards. As one of the respondents associated with this viewpoint explains:"
"78" "“ I still believe that science is done by individuals before anything else, and not by consortia. This is what I’d criticize most these days. A consortium in itself does not imply good translation and good communication. And an excellent individual researcher does not mean bad communication. In the end, it’s not the consortia, but the individual scientists who communicate” ( tf08 )"
"79" "The excellent individual scientist is identified in this viewpoint as the pivotal point for understanding and innovation:"
"80" "“ The molecular understanding of diseases is very important, as only through understanding we can get at causal, modern, new therapeutic approaches…or a similar issue: systemic approaches, thinking broader. Of course, you need excellent researchers for this and an excellent basic science” ( tf19 )."
"81" "On the negative spectrum we again find some of the measures ranked low on most components, such as new journals (B43) and the participation of nurses in the research process (B44). More surprising, and statistically significant, is the comparatively low placement of systematic reviews (B19) and practical guidelines (B23). While our qualitative material is thin on this issue, we assume that this could be the result of opposing measures that aim at improving translation through standardization, rather than focussing on individual excellence. For example, one interviewee associated with this viewpoint mentions that “in reviews you can write what you want. This means, you have to look closely at the original papers and experiments to see how they were really done” ( tf13 ). In other words, this person stresses the individual responsibility of the (excellent) researcher to interpret study results over trusting systematic reviews."
"82" "Conclusion and discussion"
"83" "Improving the translation of knowledge from bench to bedside and back requires an understanding of the particular settings where translational practices take place or should take place. Following this assumption, we interviewed practitioners between bench and bedside on what they think about translation. While there is an ongoing debate in the biomedical literature on where and how translation should be improved, little is known about practitioners views on proposed transitions and measures."
"84" "We asked the participants of our study two particular questions: 1) Where in the translational process, at which particular transitions, do you see obstacles?, and 2) How, by which regulatory and organizational measure, should these obstacles be overcome? Employing Q methodology to assess and analyse the responses, we found four distinct viewpoints for each question (eight in total), suggesting there are different collective understandings of translation in practice, with respect to both  where primary translational problems are located and what the most immediate and effective measures should be.  This may suggest, that there is no one-fits-all solution for improving translation. If it is true that successful translation hinges on particular practices of those working between bench and bedside in particular settings, then giving careful consideration to the different perspectives of these practitioners is crucial. Our analysis suggests that  attempts at improving translation will concurrently generate support and opposition from practitioners in the clinic and in the lab. In effect, regulatory and organizational measures that address translational issues in general might be less effective than those that address specific audiences and their specific viewpoints."
"85" "Our study is just a first step in this direction and suffers from a number of limitations. Our sample covered only two institutions in Germany and only practitioners who work in research or clinical settings, but leaving out,  inter alia , the views of practitioners in ambulant health care settings. The method we used provided a suitable tool for the identification of collective viewpoints, but it also has some drawbacks. The most critical one, we believe, is that by preselecting a number of statements to be ranked by the participants, we have prestructured the way of thinking about the answers to our question, although, of course, we used a strategy to select the statements so they are as representative as possible of the underlying concourse."
"86" "Future research could go in several directions. One would be to add comparative data on contextual understandings of translation in various settings and locations. This may include standardized surveys on practitioners views of translation, e.g. to assess and compare ‘institutional climates’ for translation. It may also include in-depth ethnographies on the doings of t in particular contexts, such as studying the particular perspectives and needs of clinician scientists. Finally, research on TR and its implementation in practice should link up with existing research on (biomedical) translation in science and technology studies (e.g. Boggio, Ballabeni, and Hemenway 2016; Centellas, Smardon, Fifield 2014; Pols 2014; Niezen et al. 2013; Kontopodis et al. 2011; Niewöhner et al. 2011; Shostak 2007)."
