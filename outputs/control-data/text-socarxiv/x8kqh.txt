The social stigma of unemployment:
consequences of stigma consciousness on job
search attitudes, behaviour and success
Gerhard Krug1,2* , Katrin Drasch2 and Monika Jungbauer‑Gans3

Abstract
Studies show that the unemployed face serious disadvantages in the labour market and that the social stigma of
unemployment is one explanation. In this paper, we focus on the unemployed’s expectations of being stigmatized
(stigma consciousness) and the consequences of such negative expectations on job search attitudes and behaviour.
Using data from the panel study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS), we find that the unemployed with high
stigma consciousness suffer from reduced well-being and health. Regarding job search, the stigmatized unemployed
are more likely to expect that their chances of re-employment are low, but in contrast, they are more likely to place a
high value on becoming re-employed. Instead of becoming discouraged and passive, we find that stigmatized unem‑
ployed individuals increase their job search effort compared to other unemployed individuals. However, despite their
higher job search effort, the stigma-conscious unemployed do not have better re-employment chances.

1 Introduction
Unemployment is associated with adverse consequences.
Empirical evidence has been presented for social exclusion (Hirseland and Ramos Lobato 2014), network withdrawal (Jones 1988), marital dissolution (Hansen 2005),
financial shame (Rantakeisu et al. 1999), ill health (Krug
and Eberl 2018), as well as reduced wage levels (Gangl
2004), reduced well-being (Mousteri et al. 2018), even
after re-employment. For many of these consequences,
social stigma is considered one of the central mechanisms
(for an overview, see Brand 2015). The social stigma literature, in contrast, rarely addresses the stigma of unemployment, instead focussing on the stigma of mental or
physical illness (Baumann 2007; Scambler 2009), race
(Mosley and Rosenberg 2007; Pinel et al. 2005; Sigelman
and Tuch 1997), ethnicity (Binggeli et al. 2014), sexual
orientation (Herek 2010; Mattocks et al. 2015), etc. If at

all, unemployment is only addressed as a potential consequence of other social stigmas such as mental illness or
history of incarceration (cf., Link and Phelan 2001; LeBel
2008; Karren and Sherman 2012).
However, there is no doubt that in modern welfare
states, there is a number of stereotypical beliefs regarding the attitudes of the unemployed to work and other
personal shortcomings that are seen as the main reason
for why individuals are getting and remain unemployed
(Oschmiansky et al. 2003; McFadyen 1998). One strand of
literature in labour market research explicitly addresses
unemployment as a social stigma and shows that it
might be these stereotypical beliefs that can hinder the
unemployed from getting a job. This literature focusses
on the discrimination of the unemployed, especially by
firms during the hiring process. This research consistently shows that even if they had the same qualifications
and competences as employed applicants, the unemployed and especially the long-term unemployed have
significantly lower chances of getting hired. In a recent
survey using German data, Rebien and Rothe (2018)
showed that discrimination against the unemployed is

very common. The authors found that only 14% of German firms would fill current vacancies with unemployed
applicants irrespective of their unemployment duration.
Thirty-four percent of these firms would accept such
applications only if the applicants were unemployed for
less than 1 year. The unemployment discrimination literature mostly focusses on firms’ behaviour towards the
unemployed. As a result, we have ample empirical evidence regarding the demand side of the matching process but not so much on the supply side. This empirical
one-sidedness can leave the impression that the targets of
unemployment stigma are only passive victims of potential employers’ discriminatory hiring behaviour.
In this paper, we aim to contribute to the existing literature by illuminating the role of individuals’ experience
with social unemployment stigma in shaping their behavioural responses towards being stigmatized. Specifically,
we ask whether this experience helps to co-create the
adverse re-employment chances by influencing the job
search behaviour and job search success, as is suggested
by several authors. To do this, we apply the concept of
stigma consciousness to the context of unemployment.
This concept explicitly focusses on whether stigmatized
individuals internalize the expectation of being stereotyped in social interactions. Stigma consciousness is
defined as the extent to which individual targets of specific stereotypes “focus on their stereotyped status and
believe it pervades their life experiences” (Pinel et al.
2005: 482). In other contexts of social stigma (e.g., gender,
sexual orientation, or disabilities), it has been shown that
the degree to which individuals perceive themselves to be
subjected to stigmatization significantly influences their
behaviour. For our analysis in the context of unemployment, we use data from the panel study “Labour Market
and Social Security” (PASS) (Trappmann et al. 2013). A
new scale was developed and implemented in 2013 to
measure stigma consciousness among the unemployed
(Gurr and Jungbauer-Gans 2013). We first corroborate
that a higher stigma consciousness is associated with
lower subjective well-being and lower health satisfaction.
Based on expectancy-value theory, we find that those
who are more stigma conscious have lower expectations
of finding a job but highly value obtaining a job. However,
our main result is that instead of leading to a reduced job
search effort, those unemployed with a higher stigma
consciousness are more likely to engage in an active job
search, use more job search methods, spend more time
searching for jobs, etc. Despite these positive associations with job search effort, we find that high stigma consciousness is not correlated with re-employment chances.
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses our definition of social stigma and
stigma consciousness. Section 3 presents our theoretical

considerations and how we derived our hypotheses. Section 4 presents a literature review regarding the role of
unemployment stigma in labour market outcomes. Section 5 outlines our data, operationalization and analytical
strategy. Section 6 presents the results of our study and
discusses some limitations. Section 7 concludes with a
summary and discussion of our results.

2 Definitions of stigma and stigma consciousness
The concept of stigma has received considerable interest
in social science research, but as Link and Phelan (2001)
remark, there is great variability in the definitions applied
by different researchers. According to the seminal treatment of the topic by sociologist Erving Goffman (1963:
3), stigma is “an attribute that is deeply discrediting” and
leads to negative and often hostile behaviour towards the
stigmatized. Goffman distinguishes three types of stigmatizing conditions: tribal identities (e.g., ethnicity, religion, nationality or gender), abominations of the body
(e.g., physical disabilities or deformities) and blemishes
of character (e.g., mental illness, addiction, or previous
incarceration). Unemployment can be regarded as an
example of stigma of character, where the stigmatized are
considered individuals with a “weak will, domineering or
unnatural passions, treacherous and rigid beliefs, and dishonesty” (Goffman 1963: 4).
Several researchers have expanded upon Goffman’s
definition of stigma. For example, Link and Phelan (2001)
propose conceptualizing stigma as the interrelation of
four processes. First, the differences among members of
society are distinguished and labelled. Second, these differences are associated with negative attributes. Third,
the labels attached to differences imply a separation of
“them” from “us”. Fourth, the labelled person experiences
a loss of status and discrimination. “Thus, we apply the
term stigma when elements of labelling, stereotyping,
separation, status loss and discrimination co-occur in a
power situation that allows them to unfold” (Link and
Phelan 2001: 367). This definition has been criticized by
Deacon (2006) because it sees discrimination as an integral part of the stigma concept. In contrast, she defines
stigma independent of discrimination. If we apply the
definition to the context of unemployment, stigma can be
defined as the following social process: Unemployment
is construed as preventable and controllable; “immoral”
behaviours causing unemployment are identified; these
behaviours are associated with carriers of the characteristic in other groups, drawing on existing social constructs of the “other”; the unemployed are thus blamed
for their situation; status loss is projected onto the
“other”, which may (or may not) result in disadvantage
to them (adapted from Deacon 2006: 421). In contrast to
Link and Phelan (2001, see also Besley and Coate 1992)

Krug et al. J Labour Market Res

(2019) 53:11

Deacon (2006: 421) points out that being stigmatized is
not automatically associated with disadvantages caused
by discrimination. Furthermore, stigmatization can lead
to disadvantages even in the absence of discrimination
because it can have negative consequences for the selfconcept and actions of the stigmatized individuals.
The reason for disadvantages that are independent of discrimination is that the stigma is internalized
by the stigmatized individuals and manifests itself in
self-stigma1 (Bos et al. 2013; Pryor and Reeder 2011).
According to Stuber and Schlesinger (2006), self-stigma
combines two aspects, i.e., identity and treatment stigma.
Identity stigma refers to the internalization of negative
labels and stereotypes by the stigmatized individual,
resulting in negative self-characterizations. Treatment
stigma, in turn, refers to expectations about negative
treatment by others. Both identity and treatment stigma
are part of the self-stigma and therefore to be distinguished from actual discrimination because both are
based on the perceptions of the stigmatized themselves.
“For example, administrative practices that are not inherently discriminatory (such as questions about personal
finances or living arrangements) may be interpreted by
potential recipients as such” (Stuber and Schlesinger
2006: 935).
In the empirical analysis below, we apply the concept
of stigma consciousness to the context of unemployment.
Several authors (e.g., Taylor et al. 1994, cited after LeBel
2008) have shown that there is a discrepancy between
group discrimination and the extent to which individuals
personally experience discrimination. While some stigmatized individuals do, others do not attribute negative
outcomes to stereotypes and discriminations. To cover
these differences, Pinel (1999) developed and validated
a 10-item ‘Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire’ (SCQ)
for several stereotyped groups (e.g., women, lesbians, gay
men, African Americans, and Latinos/Latinas). Stigma
consciousness reflects the extent to which individual targets of specific stereotypes “focus on their stereotyped
status and believe it pervades their life experiences”
(Pinel et al. 2005: 482). According to Pinel (1999), consciousness of the stigma is a key determinant of the
stigmatized individual’s behavioural reactions. Stigma
consciousness is argued to increase the perception of
being discriminated against and to heighten the belief
that group membership influences social interactions and
experience (Guyll et al. 2010). Negative feedback from

Other manifestations are public stigma (shared attitudes and behaviour of a
society towards the stigmatized), structural stigma (legitimization of a social
stigma by being embedded in a society’s institutions) and stigma by association (people’s reaction of being associated with a stigmatized person) (Pryor
and Reeder 2011).

others is more often interpreted as discriminatory. Thus,
stigma consciousness is viewed as a mechanism mediating the association between group membership and negative outcomes.

3 Consequences of stigma of unemployment:
theoretical considerations and hypotheses
Several scholars have examined the consequences of
internalizing stigmatizing stereotypes, but the bulk of
research focusses on contexts such as ethnicity, gender, medical conditions, sexual orientation or history of
incarceration (see e.g., LeBel 2008). In this paper, we are
interested in the stigma of unemployment and its consequences. Changes in subjective well-being and health
are among the most obvious consequences of any type
of stigma (Hatzenbuehler et al. 2013; Markowitz 1998;
Rosenfield 1997), and the stigma of unemployment
should be no exception. However, empirical evidence is
scarce, but O’Donnell et al. (2015) found that anticipated
stigma, which is a measure similar to stigma consciousness, has a negative impact on psychological distress and
physical health.
We follow this strand of research and argue that stigmatization consciousness is directly connected to subjective well-being and health. Therefore, our first two
hypotheses are concerned with the proposition that the
stigmatized suffer from their status as unemployed more
than the non-stigmatized as follows:
H1 The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the lower their subjective well-being.
H2 The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the lower their subjective health.
However, the main concern of the present analysis is
the role of stigma consciousness for job search. According to Goffman (1963), an important dimension of the
stigma influencing how it is perceived by the respective
targets, is its visibility. As an example of a stigma of character (e.g., Gurr and Jungbauer-Gans 2017), unemployment is a stigma that is not highly visible and therefore
often concealable. The unemployed are therefore “discreditable” instead of “discredited”. Thus, in social situations, the unemployed can often choose whether they
disclose information regarding their status. This is not
the case during the job search because to obtain reemployment, per definition, the unemployed have to disclose their status to other individuals.
Job search activities such as visiting the unemployment agency, asking friends for job leads, and attending
job interviews make it difficult to conceal one’s status
as unemployed and are experienced as humiliating and

Krug et al. J Labour Market Res

(2019) 53:11

potentially lead to rejection (Letkemann 2002). Therefore, reducing job search effort could be a viable strategy to avoid being stigmatized. The literature on welfare
stigma (cf., Andrade 2002) even assumes that some of the
unemployed will forego welfare benefits they are entitled to in order to avoid their stigma being made visible
(Yaniv 1997; Moffitt 1983; Loewenberg 1981). According to Sherman (2013), for those who do not have other
financial options or find themselves unable to get a job
despite their best efforts, the eventual acceptance of
welfare benefits often leads to self-hatred, shame, and
depression. Kerbo (1976) observes that welfare benefit
claimants exhibit lower job search activity than nonclaimants and attribute this behaviour to discouragement. He argues that those who felt highly stigmatized
because they received welfare were also most likely to
be the most passive. Heslin et al. (2012) develop a theoretical model that relates the labour market experience
of members of ethnic minorities to the becoming discouraged workers, i.e., wanting to work but not looking for employment due to negative experiences. They
argue that due to the stigma attached to the minority
status (lazy, untrustworthy, etc.), they fare worse in the
recruitment and selection process of employers. This
experience will make them prone to become discouraged
workers because among others, it leads to learned helplessness (Seligman 1975), that is, they become passive
and no longer try to improve the negative situation that
they perceive as uncontrollable. According to Abramson
et al. (1978), individuals are more disposed to react with
learned helplessness if they see the reason for their negative experience in themselves.
According to Pinel (1999), an important predictor of
whether individuals avoid situations in which stigma is
salient is stigma consciousness. She found that those
with higher stigma consciousness are more likely to
avoid situations where they expect to be stereotyped. For
example, compared to those with low stigma consciousness, female workers with high stigma consciousness
were more likely to intend to and actually leave their job
(Pinel and Paulin 2005). Stigma consciousness can cause
greater experience of stereotype threat, raise the level of
perceived prejudices and feelings of rejection, and reduce
the person’s sense of control and self-esteem (Wang et al.
2012). Wang and her colleagues show that a person with
high stigma consciousness more often views subtle bias
as discrimination and becomes angrier.
Thus, there seems to be a consensus in the literature
that stigmatization and specifically stigma consciousness should result in reduced job search efforts. However, there are also some indications in the literature that
this view might be too one-sided. Based on stress theory,
Miller and Kaiser (2001) note that individuals tend to

Page 4 of 27

have two options that the authors call engagement and
disengagement behaviour. While the above discussion
highlights the potential of social stigma of unemployment to result in disengagement or avoidance behaviour,
in other contexts of stigmatization (e.g., mental health),
it has been shown that some stigmatized individuals
choose engagement behaviour, e.g., raising awareness
of social stigma or in the form of problem solving. For
example, the above cited Wang et al. (2012) also find
that the high stigma conscious are more often willing to
engage in collective action. By directly referencing to the
stigma of unemployment, Bretschneider (2014) draws a
similar conclusion using group identity theory (Tajfel
and Turner 1979). She argues that to the degree that
group boundaries are perceived as permeable and social
mobility between groups is possible, individuals are more
likely to attempt to obtain a more positive sense of self
by changing groups. An important way for the unemployed to achieve this goal is by proactively engaging in
job search.
To develop testable predictions regarding the potentially ambiguous effect of stigma consciousness on the
job search effort, we can draw upon the expectancy-value
theory (Vroom 1964). This theory was first applied to the
job search process by Feather (1982), and here we extend
this theory to incorporate stigma consciousness among
the unemployed. Expectancy-value theory assumes that
the level of job search effort is determined by two factors, i.e., expectations and value. The first determinant
of job search effort expectation refers to the expectations that specific behaviour, such as the job search in our
case, will result in the desired outcome, such as obtaining gainful employment. Expectancy-value theory predicts that individuals with high expectation that their job
search will be successful will exert more effort in the job
search. Regarding the social stigma of unemployment, we
hypothesize that their expectations of meeting negative
stereotypes during the job search lead the unemployed
with higher ratings on the stigma consciousness scale to
have lower expectations of succeeding in the job search.
H3 The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the lower their expectations of their successful re-employment chances.
Value is the second determinant of effort and refers
to the degree to which the desired outcome of the job
search, i.e., becoming re-employed, is valued by the
unemployed. The central behavioural assumption is that
the higher the subjective value of the desired outcome,
the higher the effort exerted to obtain this outcome. We
assume that unemployed individuals with high levels of
stigma consciousness are more likely to place a high value

Krug et al. J Labour Market Res

(2019) 53:11

on re-employment possibly because the stigmatized are
more likely to suffer from adverse consequences due to
their status as unemployed compared to other unemployed persons. Our next hypothesis is as follows:
H4 The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the more value they place on employment.
Given that expectancy-value theory assumes that both
expectations and value determine the job search effort,
we consider predictions regarding the effect of stigma
consciousness on job search effort ambiguous. Regarding expectations, high stigma consciousness should result
in lower job search effort; however, regarding the value
of re-employment, a higher job search effort is expected.
Thus, the overall effect depends on the relative importance of either of the two factors, resulting in two competing hypotheses.
H5a The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the lower the job search effort.
H5b The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the higher the job search effort.
Several scholars assume that the actual re-employment
chances are crucially determined by the intensity of the
job search effort as follows: the higher the job search
effort, the higher the probability of obtaining adequate
and acceptable job offers (see e.g., Mortensen 1986).
Therefore, for job search success, we also posit two
opposing hypotheses. We expect that stigma consciousness has negative effects on job search success in the
case of reduced effort, but in contrast, we expect positive
effects in the case of increased job search effort.
H6a The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the lower is the job search success.
H6b The higher the stigma consciousness among the
unemployed, the higher is the job search success.

4 Literature review
Empirical evidence regarding the effect of unemployment stigma on job search behaviour is scarce. In contrast, there is ample and convincing evidence regarding
discrimination of the unemployed in employers’ hiring behaviour and so-called true unemployment state
dependence. In the following, we review the part of the
literature that explicitly connects their results to unemployment stigma as the key explanatory mechanism.

Page 5 of 27

Several studies find that firms are reluctant to fill
vacancies with an unemployed job seeker and explain
this finding by the prevalence of unemployment stigma.
In a correspondence experiment, Oberholzer-Gee
(2008) observes that the callback rates for short-term
unemployed individuals are even higher than those for
employed job seekers, but if applicants are long-term
unemployed, the callback rates decline. He finds that
even after controlling for further characteristics of the
supply side of a job offer, the duration of unemployment
has a crucial negative effect on the likelihood of being
invited to a job interview. Several studies have replicated
and extended his results. Nüß (2017) finds that callbacks
decline after 10 months of unemployment. Eriksson
and Rooth (2014) do not find that past unemployment
spells will lead to differential treatment regarding callbacks, nor will current short-term unemployment for
up to 9 months. However, after this point, stigmatization
effects arise, and callback rates decline. The authors also
observe stronger stigma effects for men than for women.
Ghayad (2014) reports that after more than 6 months
of unemployment, work experience will no longer matter. The generally positive effect of an unemployed applicant’s industry-specific human capital disappears, and
callback rates are similar to those for unemployed persons without industry-specific human capital. Kroft et al.
(2013) find that discrimination against the unemployed
is common if labour markets are tight, and callback rates
already start to decline after 6 months of unemployment.
However, some studies do not observe any stigma effects.
Nunley et al. (2017) find no effects of unemployment on
callback, irrespective of labour market tightness. Similarly, Farber et al. (2015) do not find that unemployment
reduces callback, but they do find reduced callback rates
for applicants over the age of 50. In a recent experiment,
van Belle et al. (2017) also conclude that unemployment
duration serves as a sorting criterion because employers
view it as a signal of low motivation.
In a related stream of research, stigma is considered
the reason for the so-called true state dependence in the
duration of unemployment, i.e., the effect of past unemployment on one’s current labour market status (e.g.,
Arulampalam 2001, 2002; Arulampalam et al. 2001;
Heckman and Borjas 1980). Spurious state dependence means that unobserved differences between the
unemployed create the impression that re-employment
chances diminish with longer unemployment durations.
By contrast, true state dependence means that the longer
an individual is unemployed, the lower the chances of
finding re-employment (e.g., van den Berg and van Ours
1996). One explanation provided by the literature for
how true state dependence arises is the stigmatization of
the (long-term) unemployed by employers because they

Krug et al. J Labour Market Res

(2019) 53:11

consider unemployment as a signal of low motivation or
productivity (Vishwanath 1989).
For example, Biewen and Steffes (2010) find significant
effects of past unemployment on the present unemployment risk; these effects decrease when unemployment
rates are high. The authors consider this to be evidence
of stigma effects because individual unemployment is less
likely to be interpreted as a negative signal if unemployment is high and vice versa (see also Omori 1997). Ayllón
(2013) reports similar results but also finds that if unemployment rates are high, discouragement effects counterbalance the lower stigma effect to some extent.
A third strand of literature is addressing the unemployed social experience as stigmatized but is more
strongly focussed on psychological coping mechanisms or communication strategies of the unemployed
as a reaction to their status as stigmatized. Knabe et al.
(2018) analyse whether social networks can be a substitute for stigmatized unemployed to feel respected
and appreciated. Gurr and Jungbauer-Gans (2017)
focus on whether or not the unemployed have internalized society’s view that the unemployed themselves
are to be blamed for their situation. Similar, but with
a stronger focus on job search requirements, Hirseland and Ramos Lobato (2014) found that the unemployed react to stigmatizing media discourse (“lazy
unemployed”) by either taking over the public opinion, by seeing themselves as an exception to the rule
or by complying with the public demands for intensified job search effort. Research using the same data
as that used in the following analysis yielded the following results: Lang and Gross (2017) find that unemployment stigma consciousness is determined by the
strength of deviation, the scope of the norm’s application and the intensity of formal social control; Gurr
et al. (2018) find no effects of unemployment benefit sanctions on stigma consciousness; and Linden
et al. (2018) find that being exempted from job search
requirements due to ill health does not reduce stigma
consciousness among the unemployed.
Overall, empirical evidence regarding how the social
stigma of unemployment is related to job search attitudes, behaviour and re-employment success is scarce.
To the best of our knowledge, the only studies intersecting with ours are a qualitative data analysis performed by
Hirseland and Ramos Lobato (2014) and a quantitative
paper published by Kerbo (1976); however, in both studies, no formal tests of these relationships were conducted.

5 Data and method
5.1 Data and operationalizations

In the following analysis, we use the German household
panel study PASS (Trappmann et al. 2013), which began

Page 6 of 27

in 2007, and at the time of the writing of this manuscript,
ten waves were available. PASS consists of two almost
equally large subsamples, a probability sample drawn
from all long-term unemployed persons registered with
the German federal employment services and a random
population sample. We use both samples for our analysis, but because our focus is on the unemployed, the
registered unemployed sample dominates our analytical
sample. Both subsamples of the PASS were refreshed several times and survey-provided weights are used in the
analysis below to account for panel attrition. PASS collected data regarding (un-)employment histories retrospectively, and for each wave, detailed information about
the current employment or unemployment situation is
available.
Our operationalization of unemployment stigma relies
on a scale that measures stigma consciousness among the
unemployed who were part of wave 7 of PASS (Gurr and
Jungbauer-Gans 2013).2 This scale builds upon Goffman’s
stigma concept and adapts a rather general psychological concept of gender stigmatization for the case of the
unemployed (Pinel 1999). However, it also uses insights
from other concepts and definitions described in the
theoretical section of this article (e.g., Link and Phelan
2001). We exclude the item “I am trying to find a job as
quickly as possible” because this item measures a concept similar to one of our dependent variables job search
effort. We construct an index by aggregating all but one
of the above mentioned stigma item. We normalize the
values of the scale to range from 0 (no stigmatization)
to 10 (maximum stigmatization). Table 3 in the appendix provides an overview of the items used in the scale.
With a value of Cronbach’s alpha of 0.73, this scale exhibits acceptable reliability. The average value of the scale
amounted to 5.09 with a standard deviation of 1.80, indicating on average medium stigmatization and considerable variation between individuals.
To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, we use the PASS questions
regarding life and health satisfaction, both of which are
measured on an 11-point scale (“In general, how satisfied
are you currently with your life overall?”; “How satisfied
are you today with your health?”). To test Hypothesis 3,

2

The scale was originally designed to derive different distinct factors of stigmatization and distinguish between factors pertaining expectations with
respect to other unemployed persons (in-group) and the general population
(out-group) and strategies of action (Gurr and Jungbauer-Gans 2013). However, neither the pretest of the study nor the main study of PASS wave 7 confirms these theoretical expectations, though other non-congruent factors
(social relations, avoidance of situations, pressure to act, awareness of prejudices) develop. In the PASS dataset factor analyses only confirms these factors to some extent. This could either be due to the low number of cases in
the pretest (N = 104) or the fact that distinct factors are difficult to measure
within the stigmatization framework. Therefore, and in line with Gurr et al.
(2018) and Linden et al. (2018) we use a sum score for our analyses.

Krug et al. J Labour Market Res

(2019) 53:11

we use a self-assessment of the unemployed’s employment chances (“What do you think are your chances to
find a new job in the next 6 months? good/quite good/
quite bad/bad”), which was presented to all unemployed
individuals regardless of whether they searched for a
job.3 To test Hypothesis 4, we use a factor score obtained
from a set of four items measured on a four-point scale
concerning non-monetary and monetary motivations to
work as the dependent variable. We maintained the three
items4 reflecting non-monetary motivation because these
items loaded on a common factor, whereas the fourth
item constituted an independent factor.
In Hypothesis 5a/b, job search effort is the dependent variable. We use several different measures available
in PASS to cover a wide range of potential indicators of
higher or lower job search effort (see Table 4 in Appendix for a detailed overview). Our first and most basic
indicator uses binary information regarding whether the
respondent actively searched for a job within the prior
4 weeks. A second indicator is the sum of all job search
methods actively used in the last 4 weeks. The third indicator uses additional information on the intensity with
which a specific job search method was used. We use a
sum score of all job search intensities from all job search
methods used by the respondent. If a method is not used,
intensity is coded as 0. Indicator number four is the
number of hours spent searching for a job. Indicator five
measures the number of times during the last 4 weeks a
respondent used one of the following ways to apply for
a job: replied to job advertisements, placed an “employment wanted” advertisement with the newspaper, asked
for a job at the company itself or submitted an application even though no job opening had been advertised.
We set all indicators of the job search effort to zero for
those respondents who left the labour force (e.g., “homemaker”) because per definition, these individuals are not
searching for a job, and not including them would systematically excludes the most discouraged unemployed.
In Hypotheses 6a/b, we are interested in the job search
success. This is measured first as the number of job interviews a respondent had during the last 4 weeks. Second,
we construct a dummy variable that assumes the value of
one for those who hold a job and zero for those who are

For several other items regarding job search expectations and attitudes, this
was not the case.

Let us now deal with the topic of work and gainful employment. Regardless of whether you currently work or not: To what extent do you agree to
the following opinions on work? Please think very generally about working in a job. Please tell me whether you “strongly agree”, “somewhat agree”,
“somewhat disagree” or “strongly disagree” with these opinions. “Having work is the most important thing in life.”; “Work is important because
it gives you the feeling of being a part of something/belonging.”; “I would
also like to work if I didn’t need the money”. (Official translation provided
by PASS).

unemployed, have withdrawn from the labour force or
are in any other state (e.g., retirement).
5.2 Sample selection and analytical design

Because stigma consciousness is measured only in one
single wave, our analytical sample is in principle a crosssection. However, the stigma consciousness scale is
embedded in an ongoing panel study. Therefore, while
stigma consciousness is measured in wave 7, the outcome
variables are obtained from wave 8 of the PASS study. We
include several important covariates (often time-constant
or measured at wave 7) as control variables to account
for socio-demographic information, including age, age
squared, gender, marital status, migration background,
educational attainment, place of residence (East/West
Germany), household size, and household income, and
a dummy variable representing the general population
and the welfare benefit sample. The descriptive statistics
(mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, and
number of cases) of the dependent and independent variables are shown in Table 5 in Appendix.
In addition, we include information regarding previous employment status (unemployed, employed, or out
of the labour force), which was measured in wave 6. Furthermore, we included unemployment duration and the
number of previous unemployment spells, which were
measured at wave 7, as controls because these variables
might influence the level of stigma consciousness. However, because we have no information regarding the level
of stigma consciousness at the beginning of the unemployment episode, the current unemployment duration can also be an outcome of stigma consciousness,
especially if reduced job search effort is the dominant
reaction of the stigmatized. Alternatively, we can also
consider unemployment duration and previous unemployment as alternative measures of unemployment
stigma, albeit potentially confounded by the depreciation
of human capital. Because of these alternative views, we
also test our hypotheses without including the unemployment duration variables in the model. We find that
the choice of including unemployment duration did not
substantially influence our results (see Tables 6 and 7 in
Appendix).5
In summary, our analytical sample is selected as follows. From the 14,449 respondents in wave 7, we
restrict ourselves to 2448 respondents who were eligible to answer the stigma consciousness scale items. The
main criterion for eligibility is registered unemployment

5

Because unemployment duration is often seen to be negatively related to
job-search effort, this stability might seem surprising. However, Schels and
Bethmann (2018) found that for most unemployed, job search effort remains
stable over time.

during wave 7. We exclude individuals with missing
stigma scale values, reducing the sample to 2286 individuals. Finally, we exclude those who dropped out in wave
8 (we used the PASS provided weights to account for this
panel attrition), resulting in 1779 cases remaining. For
Hypothesis 1, we arrive at our analytical sample of 1278,
which included individuals who were still unemployed or
moved to the silent reserve (“homemaker”) at the time
of wave 8. For Hypothesis 2, the same sample is used if
the number of job interviews is the dependent variable.
If job-finding is the dependent variable, the sample size
increases to 1573 because those who found employment
between waves 7 and 8 will be included also. To avoid any
further loss of cases and, thus, precision in our estimate,
we multiply impute (Rubin 1987) the missing data in any
of two cases. First, we impute the data if the data were
missing due to item non-response. Second, we impute
the data if the data were missing for respondents who
entered the panel survey only during wave 7 because in
this case, no information on several variables from wave
6 was available.
With our estimation strategy we follow standard procedures using liner regression, except for that we also use
linear regression analyses for binary and ordinal outcome
variables because the estimation of marginal effects after
multiple imputations is cumbersome (see STATA multiple
imputation reference manual release 13: 77). Thus, linear
regressions are conducted to analyse life and health satisfaction (ordinal), re-employment expectation (ordinal),
non-monetary employment motivation (continuous), active
job search (binary), re-employment (binary) and job search
intensity (continuous). All other outcomes are count data
variables, i.e., hours spent searching, the number of job
search methods, the number of applications and the number of job interviews, and we use negative binomial count
data regressions, a method similar to Poisson regression,
but more generally applicable (Cameron and Trivedi 2010).

6 Results
6.1 Hypotheses tests

This section presents the results of our empirical analysis. Please note that in the following, the terms “effect”
and “coefficient” are used interchangeably and without
intending to imply causality. See Sect. 7 for a discussion
regarding what speaks for or against a causal interpretation of our regression results. In Table 1, Models 1–4
present the results of Hypotheses 1–4. Hypotheses 1 and
2 posit that people suffer from unemployment stigma,
and therefore, higher stigma consciousness is associated
with lower subjective well-being and lower health. As
shown by Model 1 in Table 1, the coefficient of stigma
consciousness is negative and statistically significant.
The coefficient is −0.319, indicating that a one point (or

Page 8 of 27

equivalently a 10%) increase in stigma consciousness is
associated with ca. 0.32-point reduction on the 11-point
life-satisfaction scale. This reduction is only a slight one,
because it accounts for a small part of the standard deviation of the dependent variable (see Table 5 in Appendix).
The results of health satisfaction (Model 2 in Table 1)
are similar, although the coefficient (0.196) is smaller. As
shown, the respective coefficient is also statistically significant and negative, indicating that high stigma consciousness is associated with lower health satisfaction.
Therefore, the data support hypotheses 1 and 2.
Hypothesis 3 focusses on the unemployed’s job expectations and posits that a negative association exists between
stigma consciousness and self-perceived re-employment
chances. Based on Model 3 in Table 1, the coefficient of
the stigma consciousness scale on the 4-point scale of
self-assessed chances of re-employment is − 0.047, which
as predicted, is negative and statistically significant. The
higher the unemployed’s stigma consciousness, the lower
their expectations of transitioning from unemployment to
employment. Hypothesis 4 concerns the positive relationship between unemployment stigma and the value placed
on re-employment. The respective coefficient (Model 4
in Table 1) is 0.125, which is statistically significant. Thus,
Hypotheses 3 and 4 are also supported by our data.
In Table 2, the results of Hypotheses 5a/b and 6a/b are
presented. In both hypotheses, the theoretical prediction is ambiguous, allowing for both positive and negative associations between unemployment stigma and job
search effort and job search success.
In Model 1 in Table 2, the dependent variable is active
job search. Instead of the negative regression coefficient
expected from Hypothesis 3a, Model 1 reports that
stigma consciousness has a positive effect on whether
unemployed individuals actively search for a job, and
this effect is significant at the 0.1% level. For every additional point on the ten-point stigma consciousness scale,
the probability of actively searching for a job increases by
2.6% points. Thus, two hypothetical individuals who are
located at the opposite ends of the stigma consciousness
scale could differ by 26% points in their probability of
engaging in active job search, whereas the average probability of an active job search is approximately 52% in our
analytical sample (see Table 5 in Appendix).
Model 2 in Table 2 extends the binary outcome variable by not only looking at active search but at the number of job search methods used during job search. With
each additional point on the stigma consciousness scale,
the number of methods significantly increases on average by 0.067, which is also only a slight increase. Model 3
then takes into account that job search intensity can vary
within each method used for job search and uses the sum
score of all the respondents’ values for each method used

as the dependent variable. Again, we observe a significantly
positive but rather small effect. Our next indicator of job
search effort is the number of hours spent searching for a
job, where the coefficient of stigma consciousness is significant only at the 5% level. On average, an additional point on
the stigma scale results in approximately 4.6 min per week

(60 min * 0.077) more time spent searching for a job. For
Model 5, the number of times the unemployed applied for
a job is the dependent variable. We observe a positive and
statistically significant coefficient of 0.069, indicating that a
one-point increase in the stigma variable is associated with
ca. 0.07 more applications.

Our empirical analysis based on several different indicators of job search effort finds empirical support for
Hypothesis 5b, i.e., stigma-conscious unemployed individuals increase their job search effort.
Turning to Hypothesis 6, we have two different indicators of an unemployed individual’s job search success.
The first indicator focusses on the number of job interviews during the last 4 weeks of those still unemployed
(Model 6). Here, the association with stigma consciousness is positive but the coefficient is small and statistically
insignificant. Considering Model 7 in which the dependent variable is actual re-employment, we find that stigma
consciousness is slightly negatively related to re-employment probability, but again, this effect is not statistically
significant.
6.2 Robustness checks

Here, we report some robustness checks and tests of
potential alternative explanations for our empirical
results.
A first alternative explanation concerns the relationship between stigma consciousness and job-search effort.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the level of job
search effort could lead to high stigma consciousness
and not the other way around. For example, we might
assume that those who are starting their job search
with above average job search effort are more prone to
interpret their experience of continued unemployment
as the result of stigmatization. In both cases, a positive
regression coefficient of job search effort on stigma consciousness will arise in cross-sectional data. However, if
the regression coefficients reflect such differences in job
search effort at the beginning of the unemployment spell,
the positive relationship should disappear once these initial differences are accounted for. Thus, as a robustness
check, we measure the job search effort at the start of
the unemployment episode. Specifically, we use the job
search effort from the start of the unemployment spell
or if observations remain censored because the respondents entered the panel survey during unemployment, job
search effort from the first observed wave.6 The underlying idea here is that job search effort during the early
stage of the unemployment spell is not influenced by
stigma consciousness because it is defined as the expectation of being subjected to negative stereotypes during the job search. To the degree that these expectations
6

For example, if an individual entered unemployment during wave 4 and is
still observed as unemployed during wave 7 (our main sample selection criterion), the indicator measures job search effort during wave 4. If the individual
entered the panel survey during wave 5 as unemployed and was unemployed
at least until wave 7, the job search effort is measured at wave 5. If the individual was employed before wave 7, the job search effort on the job is measured
at wave 6.

Page 11 of 27

are based on actual experiences, measuring job search
behaviour at the beginning of the job search suggests that
only minimal experiences have been gathered and that
the level of job search effort should still be relatively independent of such negative experiences.
Unfortunately, information regarding the initial job
search effort is only available for active job search, number of job search methods and number of job interviews.
However, at least for these outcomes, we can perform a
robustness check by including the respective initial values as additional control variables. We extend this procedure to the analysis of life and health satisfaction
and we control for the initial value at the first observed
wave in unemployment, too. As shown in Appendix,
Table 8, including the initial levels of the dependent variables reduces the size of the coefficients of stigma consciousness in all cases, but the basic conclusions remain
unchanged. The coefficients tend to be smaller but are
still positive and statistically significant. However, using
past values of the dependent variable (so-called lags)
has been criticized not only in the context of panel data
(Nickell 1981) but also, more recently, in pooled crosssectional data analysis by Vaisey and Miles (2017).
Thus, this strategy might not be able to remove the bias
entirely.7
A second alternative explanation is concerned with
whether increasing the job search effort is really based
on the autonomous decision of the unemployed as suggested by our theoretical framework. In contrast, as
posited by self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci
2000), increased effort can also be the result of externally
controlled behaviour. Following Hirseland and Ramos
Lobato (2014), we might assume that the increased job
search effort of those unemployed experiencing high

7

In our application, lagging the dependent variable could pose a problem if in
technical terms, large reverse causality bias and large bias due to unobserved
confounders coincide. According to results from a Monte Carlo simulation
by Vaisey and Miles (2017), if bias due to unobserved confounders is low to
medium, the results of a regression with and without lagged dependent variables can be considered the lower and upper bounds, e.g., for the dependent
variable “active job search (yes)”, the upper bound is 0.026 (Table 2, Model 1)
and the lower bound is 0.014 (see Table 8, Model 3). However, we emphasize
that there is an important difference between our strategy and the strategy
criticized by Vaisey and Miles (2017). We do not simply lag the dependent
variable for one period, which was the approach used by Vaisey and Mills
(2017). In that case, we would still use a value of the dependent variable (job
search effort) that has potentially been influenced by prior values of the focal
independent variable (stigma consciousness). Instead, we aim to control for
the initial (or at least the earliest observed) value of job search effort. Thus,
we aim to measure the dependent variable at a point in its history when it is
still “uncontaminated” by the focal independent variable. In the simulated data
reported by Vaisey and Miles (2017), there is never such a point in the common history of the dependent and independent variables, which may explain
why lagging does not work as intended. To clarify this distinction, we refer
to “initial values” instead of “lags” of the dependent variables (see Table 8 in
Appendix).

stigma consciousness could be the result of their attempts
to comply with the demands placed upon them by case
workers at local unemployment offices. To “activate” the
unemployed, case workers often monitor their job search
effort and sanction those who do not comply with what
in Germany is called “Mitwirkungspflicht” (duty to cooperate). If this monitoring is successful such that it leads
to increased job search efforts but simultaneously makes
the unemployed feel depreciated and stereotyped as the
“lazy unemployed”, high stigma consciousness could arise
as a by-product of such monitoring practices. Consequently, the positive effect of stigma consciousness could
be spurious and solely based on the level of monitoring
through unemployment offices and their case workers
as a common cause. To test this alternative explanation,
we included information on whether an integration
agreement was signed between the unemployed and the
case worker as an additional covariate. Furthermore,
we included a factor score measuring the self-perceived
quality of the unemployeds’ experiences with the job
center and their staff members. The factor sore was
derived from a factor analyses on items of a respective
items set.8 We found that the inclusion of these variables
did not substantially change the results (see Tables 9 and
10 in Appendix).
Third, a further alternative explanation, especially for
the results concerning job search effort, is social desirability bias. Social desirability bias refers to survey
respondents’ tendency to adapt their answers towards
what they perceive to be the social norm. To explain
the positive association between stigma consciousness
and effort, social desirability bias must upward bias the
reporting of both job search effort and stigma consciousness, net of all covariates, such as age, gender and education. Clearly, there is a danger that individuals tend to
overstate their job search effort in an interview situation
because given the public debate regarding the lazy unemployed, high effort to end unemployment is normatively
more acceptable than low effort. However, regarding

How far do the following statements apply to your personal experience with
the Job centre and their staff members? Please tell me whether these statements “Apply completely”, “Tend to apply”, “Tend not to apply” or “Do not
apply at all”. (A) The staff dictate too much what I am to do; (B) They really
want to help me there; (C) I expect that my situation will improve through
the counselling; (D) They support me in finding a job again; (E) Only demands
are put forward by them, but I don’t get any support; (F) I trust the staff; (G)
My ideas are taken into consideration in counselling; (v) The staff members
are friendly and helpful to me; One item (C) had to be excluded from the
scale because of positive and negative correlations with the other items, two
items (A and E) were reversed so that higher values indicate a more positive
experience. The scale proved to be one-dimensional and is sufficiently reliable
(Cronbach’s alpha 0.85). The scale was only presented to those unemployed
that were actually registered with the job center, i.e., recipients of welfare benefits, thus the number of observations are slightly lower compared to the main
analysis.

stigma consciousness, the nature of social stigma is that
it is rather hidden in social interactions than overemphasized. Therefore, social desirability bias is more likely to
lead to a downward bias in reporting the level of stigma
experienced during unemployment.9 Overall, this logic
argues against social desirability bias as an alternative
explanation.
Fourth, in accordance with our theoretical framework, many of our dependent variables are based on selfassessment and measure respondent’s perceptions, e.g.,
of being subjected to stereotypes or of their labour market chances. Therefore, personality traits such as self-efficacy or the “Big 5” personality traits might be a common
cause for the negative relationship of stigma consciousness and subjective well-being and/or with the positive
association with job search effort. Therefore, in a further
robustness check, we conducted our analysis controlling
for these traits. Self-efficacy is defined as generalized selfefficacy and was measured as sum score obtained from
five items10 measured in wave 7. These items focus on the
personal assessment of one’s own competences to deal
with difficulties and barriers in everyday life (Schwarzer
and Jerusalem 1995, 1999) and were used as sum indices. Further personality traits were measured using the
21-item version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-K) which
covers rather broad personality dimensions extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience (Rammstedt and John 2005). Those
traits are only available in wave 5 and for those respondents in our sample who did not already participate in that
wave, values had to be multiply imputed. We found that
even if some of the personality traits are significantly correlated with some outcomes, including self-efficacy or the
“Big 5” personality traits does not substantially change
the results. Whereas the coefficients of stigma consciousness for well-being and health become smaller, those for
job-search effort even slightly increase (see Tables 11 and
12 in Appendix).

Since the PASS is a dual mode survey, one way to test for social desirability
bias is to determine whether both job-search effort and stigma consciousness
are higher among those engaged in face-to-face interviews compared to those
engaged in telephone interviews (under the assumption that social desirable
answers are more common face-to-face). However, we observe lower instead
of higher job-search effort in face-to-face interviews, which is not consistent
with social desirability bias.

Whenever unexpected difficulties or problems show up, there are different ways of reacting to that. We grouped some opinions about that topic
here. Please tell me, whether to you those opinions “Apply completely”,
“Tend to apply”, “Tend not to apply” or “Do not apply at all”. (A) I have a
solution for every problem. (B) Even when things happen surprisingly, I
believe that I can cope with them. (C) I have no difficulties in achieving my

always solve difficult problems if I try to.

Finally, the Appendix also documents that the results
without multiple imputation are, except for higher standard errors, similar to those after multiple imputation (see
Tables 13 and 14 in Appendix).
6.3 Limitations

An important caveat of our analysis is that our results
might only apply to the German context and need not
necessarily extend to countries with different systems of
social security or welfare traditions. In general, Germany
is assumed to be characterized by a social security system
that has a strong focus on status maintenance. For example, Paugam and Russell (2000) argue that due to the high
importance of employment for social status in Germany,
unemployment is likely to lead to social stigma. Within
the German context, our analytical sample is characterized by a high share of long-term unemployed, mostly
recipients of welfare benefits. In Germany, unemployment insurance benefit receipt is limited to 12 months
for the general population and 24 month for workers
55 years or older. After the insurance benefits expire, the
unemployed can receive means-tested basic income support. Basic income support consists of a flat rate, and the
unemployed are only eligible for support if their household income is below a certain threshold. However, our
indicator of stigma consciousness does not focus on the
stigma of welfare receipt but on the general stigma of
unemployment. Therefore, we cannot answer the question regarding whether a measure of stigma consciousness focusing more on welfare state dependency could
lead to different results. In addition, due to our analytical sample restrictions, we focus on unsuccessful job
searches, increasing the tendency to over represent the
long-term unemployed. However, the long-term unemployed should be subject to stronger stigma than the
short-term unemployed, and unsuccessful job searches
should be more likely to lead to passivity. Therefore,
notably, even in this analytical sample (average unemployment duration in wave 6 is slightly over 5 years), the
association with job search effort is positive.
A second limitation concerns the results on actual
re-employment. The results for job search effort and
the number of job interviews on the one hand and reemployment chances on the other hand are observed
on systematically divergent populations (the former is
only observed among those who did not find re-employment), the interpretation that increased job search effort
does not increase re-employment chances can thus be
challenged. In addition for re-employment, a duration

Page 13 of 27

analysis might have been the more informative and
appropriate method. However, even if our focal independent variable stigma consciousness is in principle
time-varying, it was measured in PASS at only one point
in time. This point in time is different for all respondents
with respect to their previous unemployment duration.
Given that unemployment duration influences stigma
consciousness, it is crucial for our analysis to control for
this variable. In a duration analysis, unemployment duration would already be the dependent variable, therefore
controlling for elapsed unemployment duration until the
stigma consciousness was measured would induce endogeneity. Therefore, we rely on the simpler logistic regression model, where we can control for unemployment
duration. We acknowledge, however, that this discards a
lot of information and is only a workaround.

7 Discussion and conclusion
An important strand of literature in labour market
research is concerned with the effect of unemployment
stigma on re-employment chances. This literature shows
that the unemployed are stigmatized in the sense that
they face serious disadvantages on the labour market,
irrespective of their actual motivation, skills and behaviour and that unemployment can create a vicious cycle
where unemployment begets further unemployment. In
contrast, literature on the behaviour of the unemployed
themselves is scarce and prone to assume that the typical
reaction of the unemployed to being stigmatized is passivity and withdrawal behaviour.
Our paper is the first to present an empirical test of
how stigma consciousness relates to job search attitudes and behaviour. We tested several hypotheses and
interpreted the empirical evidence as follows. First, we
corroborated the results of other studies showing that
being stigmatized has negative consequences on individual well-being and health. Those who rated higher on
the stigma consciousness scale also showed significantly
lower life and health satisfaction. Based on expectancyvalue theory, we found that being subjected to the social
stigma of unemployment leads the unemployed to have
lower expectations of successfully leaving unemployment. In contrast, the value of employment increases
most likely because re-employment is an effective way to
free the unemployed from unemployment stigma.
While the literature on unemployment suggests discouragement or withdrawal among the unemployed,
we posit two possible reactions of the unemployed
towards perceiving themselves stigmatized with respect

Krug et al. J Labour Market Res

(2019) 53:11

to job search behaviour. If the low expected employment chances dominate the stigmatized’s behaviour,
these individuals should decrease their job search effort.
In contrast, if a higher value of employment dominates,
the stigmatized should actually increase their job search
effort. By presenting empirical evidence from several different indicators of job search effort, we found that high
values of stigma consciousness were associated with
more rather than less effort, e.g., in terms of engaging in
an active job search, the number of hours spent searching
or the number of job applications. We interpret this as
evidence that the stigmatized unemployed are not characterized by passiveness or learned helplessness as the literature sometimes suggests. In contrast, we interpret this
finding as evidence that the stigmatized suffer from their
experience of joblessness even more than the average
unemployed and aim to leave unemployment to change
their social status and eliminate the social stigma. However, for individuals subjected to unemployment stigma,
such increased effort does not lead to better actual reemployment chances. Despite its positive association
with job search effort, we found no statistically significant
association between stigma consciousness and the number of job-interviews or even re-employment probability.
Overall, we interpret our results as evidence that those
who experience unemployment stigma during their job
search suffer more from their experience of joblessness
but do not tend to react with withdrawal and passivity.
These individuals do not quit the job search and instead
increase their effort by utilizing more methods to search
for a job, spend more hours searching and send more job
applications to potential employers. However, no empirical evidence supports that this increased effort helps the
unemployed improve their situation by leaving unemployment. This result is in line with Gielen and van Ours
(2014), who find that even if the unhappy unemployed
search more actively for a job, it does not impact their
unemployment duration. The results are also in line with
Hohmeyer and Wolff (2018) who find that One-Euro-Job
announcements increase job search effort but does not
lead to higher employment probability.
Because we mainly rely on cross-sectional data, alternative explanations of the observed pattern of associations
are possible. For example, high stigma consciousness
could instead be a reaction of high-effort job seekers
who become frustrated by the absence of re-employment success. Furthermore, pressure from employment

Page 14 of 27

offices might be a common cause of both high stigma
consciousness and high job search effort. We attempted
to test these alternative explanations as much as possible and found no evidence supporting these explanations over our own. However, we must acknowledge
that these alternative explanations cannot be entirely
dismissed given that there seems to be no bulletproof
solution, especially regarding reverse causality, which
is particularly true for cross-sectional data but in many
regards also extends to longitudinal data (see e.g., Vaisey
and Miles 2017). With longitudinal data, more sophisticated methods are available (cf., Leszczensky and Wolbring 2018), but these methods are also not without their
own problems. Therefore, further research is needed to
corroborate our results. Such research should preferably
be based on longitudinal data that includes the measurement of unemployment stigma at several points in time,
including the beginning of unemployment. To gain such
data, refining the existing scale could be worth the effort
to obtain a shorter scale that is more easily incorporated
into panel surveys to measure unemployment stigma.
