Abstract
Past alcohol use is positively associated with the desire to drink after exposure to social
media alcohol ads. The current study sought to determine if this relationship was moderated by
the user engagement values or user-generated comments (UGCs) that appear alongside the ads.
An analysis of data collected for a mixed factorial experiment was conducted. Alcohol use was
measured using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). The desire to drink among
participants (n=118) was measured after each of four Facebook beer ad exposures. Main and
interactive effects were assessed using generalized linear mixed modeling, and models were
adjusted for demographics and Facebook involvement.

There was a significant interaction

between AUDIT scores and UGCs (p=0.029). The desire to drink was significantly greater among
higher-risk drinkers compared to low-risk drinkers (p’s<0.001 to p=0.029). Pro-drinking UGCs
increased the desire to drink but only among low-risk drinkers (p< 0.001). User engagement values
had no effect. Regulating the content of social media alcohol ads may protect higher-risk drinkers.
Regulating UGCs associated with social media alcohol ads may protect low-risk drinkers.

Introduction
Response to Alcohol Cues
Substantial research demonstrates that alcohol-related cues (e.g. a glass of beer) elicit
multiple physiological and psychological responses important to future alcohol use and the
addiction process (Bordnick et al., 2008; Eddie et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2008; Reid, Flammino,
Starosta, Palamar, & Franck, 2006). For example, among alcohol dependent patients recruited
from a treatment program, alcohol cues significantly increased alcohol craving, desire to drink,
alcohol-like highs, positive drinking expectancies, and alcohol-like withdrawal in a laboratory
setting (Reid et al., 2006). Individuals with alcohol dependence have reported high levels of
craving after exposure to alcohol cues when completing a virtual reality coping skills training
program (Lee et al., 2008), and subjective craving for alcohol increased in a sample of nontreatment seeking individuals with alcohol use disorders after exposure to alcohol cues through a
virtual reality program (Bordnick et al., 2008). Greater subjective arousal after cue exposure was
also detected in a sample of college students mandated to undergo brief interventions for alcohol
use (Eddie et al., 2013).
Binge drinking may be associated with higher reactivity to alcohol-related stimuli and
lower reactivity to non-alcohol-related stimuli (Petit, Kornreich, Dan, Verbanck, & Campanella,
2014), and greater alcohol cue reactivity may occur in non-dependent binge drinkers, with the
effect more pronounced among men (Petit, Kornreich, Verbanck, & Campanella, 2013).
Moreover, positive affective stimuli associated with drinking occasions can stimulate craving in
the absence of direct alcohol cues (Mason, Light, Escher, & Drobes, 2008), and heavy alcohol
users or those with symptoms of alcohol dependence may have greater reactions to images of

drinking contexts, such as parties, than visualizations of a drink itself (Lee, Namkoong, Lee, An,
& Lee, 2006).
Physiologically, high craving heavy alcohol users have shown immediate heart
deceleration and a significant increase in difficulty resisting a drink after exposure to alcohol
pictures, indicating interest at an autonomic level along with pre-attentive processing and
autonomic attentional focusing on the alcohol stimulus (Ingjaldsson, Thayer, & Laberg, 2003a;
Ingjaldsson, Thayer, & Laberg, 2003b). Moreover, individuals with an alcohol use disorder may
have difficulty disengaging from alcohol cues due to a deeper, semantic analysis of the cue that
results in an inability to shift attention to a non-alcohol stimulus (Storkmark, Field, Hugdahl, &
Horowitz, 1997), and slower reaction times have been documented in heavy alcohol users after
exposure to alcohol cues (Cox, Yeates, & Regan, 1999).
Digital Media
With the rise of digital media, individuals are routinely exposed to alcohol cues through
non-traditional platforms. Up to 96% of college students may view alcohol use by peers on social
media (Erevik, Pallesen, Andreassen, Vedaa, & Torsheim, 2018), and approximately 75% of these
depictions may portray positive aspects of alcohol use (Erevik, Torsheim, Andreassen, Vedaa, &
Pallesen, 2017). Moreover, 40% of youth and 25% of adults may regularly view digital alcohol
advertisements (Jernigan, Padon, Ross, & Borzekowski, 2017), which can associate alcoholic
beverages with adventure/sensation seeking, sports, and party atmospheres (Noel & Babor, 2017).
Specific to social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, there is
substantial additional information surrounding each alcohol depiction. User engagement values
are the total number of Likes, Shares, and Comments elicited by a social media post, and they may
serve as a proxy for social reinforcement of a post’s message (Boyle, Smith, Earle, & LaBrie,

2018). User-generated comments are comments that appear alongside a social media post and
written by social media users in direct response to the post.
In general, the greater number of “Likes” a social media post receives, the more credible
the post’s message (Borah, & Xiao, 2018). Greater perceived “Likes” of alcohol-related posts was
predictive of peer approval for risky alcohol use among college non-drinkers (Boyle, Smith, Earle,
& LaBrie, 2018), and greater user engagement values associated with alcohol ads on Facebook
was associated with increased drinking intentions (Alhabash, McAlister, Quilliam, Richards, &
Lou, 2015). Similarly, pro-drinking user-generated comments associated with beer advertisements
on Facebook increased the desire to drink in a sample of young adults (Noel, & Babor, 2018).
Indeed, user engagement values and user-generated comments may explain, in part, the positive
association between viewing alcohol-related material on social media and alcohol use (Hoffman,
Pinkleton, Weintraub Austin, & Reyes-Velázquez, 2014).
Alcohol Advertising on Social Media
Alcohol advertising has proliferated on social media platforms through the last two decades
(Jernigan & Rushman, 2014). For example, there were 100,000 subscriptions to 20 Indian and
Australian alcohol brands YouTube channels by 2015 (Gupta, Lam, Pettigrew, & Tait, 2018), and
the brands Heineken, Budweiser, Smirnoff, Skol, and Johnnie Walker exceeded 12 million Likes
on Facebook by the same year (Lobstein, Landon, Thornton, & Jernigan, 2017). Heineken and
Chivas Regal gained over 500,000 Likes over the Christmas-New Year’s period in 2015-2016
alone.
Descriptive and thematic content analyses have been conducted on alcohol ads published
on social media. Ads often include notifications of parties, concerts, and other events; feature
celebrities; provide opportunities to download branded apps or widgets; and direct appeals for

product purchases (Lobstein et al., 2017). A review of Instagram posts found product appeals and
the physical benefits of alcohol as the most common with significant minorities focusing on
camaraderie, individuality, personal achievement, and positive emotions (Barry et al., 2018). A
similar review of Facebook posts identified adventure/sensation seeking and sports in a majority
of posts (Noel & Babor, 2017).
Currently, there are no federal regulations in the United States (U.S.) restricting alcohol
advertising activities. Consequently, the U.S. alcohol industry has voluntarily agreed to restrict
alcohol advertising through a self-regulatory system wherein the industry creates and enforces a
specific set of rules (International Alliance for Responsible Drinking [IARD], 2011; IARD, 2014).
These self-regulation codes contain several provisions intended to restrict the content, exposure,
and access to social media alcohol ads. However, current evidence suggests poor compliance with
these rules. Approximately 80% of social media ads may contain content that violates the codes
(Noel & Babor, 2017), and several studies have demonstrated that currently technology is
insufficient to prevent minors from accessing such content (e.g. Barry et al., 2016; Barry et al.,
2015; Jones, Thom, Davoren, & Barrie, 2014).
Study Purpose
In light of past research demonstrating that heavy alcohol users react strongly to alcohol
cues and recent research highlighting attributes of social media that may moderate the response to
alcohol cues, the present study was conducted to determine if user engagement values or usergenerated comments moderate the relationship between alcohol use and the desire to drink after
exposure to Facebook beer ads. It was hypothesized that user engagement values and usergenerated comments will have no effect on heavy alcohol users due to autonomic processing and

focused attention on the alcohol cue (i.e. beer ad). Any effects of user engagement or usergenerated comments would be reserved for non-heavy alcohol users.
Methods
The present study analyzed data collected for a 2 (within) x 2 (between) x 2 (between)
factorial experiment that was designed to determine if ad content, user engagement values, and/or
user-generated comments (UGCs) were associated with the desire to drink after viewing four
Facebook beer ads. Study participants were randomized to one of four between-subject study
conditions: high user engagement/pro-drinking UGCs, high user engagement/anti-drinking UGCs,
low user engagement/pro-drinking UGCs, and low user engagement/anti-drinking UGCs. The
desire to drink was measured after each ad exposure. It was previously reported that alcohol ad
content had no effect on the desire to drink (Noel, & Babor, 2018), and as such, the effect of ad
content was ignored during the present analysis.
Participants
A convenience sample of participants were recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
(AMT), an online platform that can produce representative samples of the U.S. population
(Simons, & Chabris, 2012). Participants were required to live in the U.S., be 21 to 24 years old,
and have internet access. There were no exclusion criteria. Participant recruitment occurred in
two stages. In stage one, a screening survey was posted on AMT. Individuals completing the
screening survey (n = 1,759) were compensated $0.05 through the AMT platform. Private
invitations were sent to study eligible individuals (n = 200, 11%).

Among study eligible

individuals, 60% (n = 120) agreed to participate and were reimbursed $10 through AMT at study
completion. All individuals who agreed to participate in the study completed the minimum study
requirements (100%).

Ad Selection
Each participant viewed four Facebook beer ads that were previously evaluated for content
(Noel & Babor, 2017). Beer ads were selected due to their rapid proliferation on social media, and
the ability of minors to access the brand’s social media profiles. Ads were published by Bud Light
(nad = 2) and Budweiser (nad = 2) within one month of the 2015 U.S. National Football League
Super Bowl. Bud Light and Budweiser were selected because they were the official beer sponsors
of the Super Bowl, and there was the potential for a large volume of ad exposure before, during,
and after the event. The ads were purposefully selected based on their compliance with a selfregulated alcohol marketing code (i.e. two ads were compliant and two ads were non-compliant)
and for content (i.e. each compliant ad was matched for content with a same brand non-compliant
ad). The ads used in the study were published in Supplemental Figure 1 of Noel et al. (2018).
User Engagement Values
User engagement values were defined as the total number of Likes, Shares, and Comments
elicited by a Facebook beer ad. Each ad was associated with a unique set of user engagement
values. Real-world values were taken from a sample of Facebook Bud Light and Budweiser ads
that were previously evaluated for content and regulatory compliance (Noel, & Babor, 2017).
Participants were randomized to view either high (e.g. “27k Likes”, “11k Shares”, “4.5k
comments”) or low, but non-zero, user engagement values (e.g. “216 Likes”, “22 Shares”, “12
Comments”). The wide discrepancy between the high and low values group was purposefully
selected to elicit a large between-group difference.

User-Generated Comments (UGCs)
UGCs were defined as comments published by non-brand affiliated Facebook users in
direct response to the Facebook beer ad and that appeared directly below the ad. Each ad was
associated with a unique set of UGCs. Each set consisted of two unique, real-world comments
that were written by actual Facebook users in response to a previously evaluated Bud Light or
Budweiser Facebook ad (Noel, & Babor, 2017). Two comments were used to mimic the default
number of comments that appear beneath a Facebook post, and comments were selected based on
the results of a thematic content analysis (Noel, Babor, & Grady, 2018). Participants were
randomized to view either pro-drinking or anti-drinking UGCs. Within the pro-drinking UGC
group, each ad was associated with one “positive consequences” comment (e.g. “Some call it a six
pack I call it my support group”) and one “past drinking” comment (e.g. “I done had so many of
these tonight lol”). Within the anti-drinking UGC group, each ad was associated with one
“negative consequences” comment (e.g. “I lost a friend behind your product. U guys suck”) and
one “abstinence/sobriety” comment (e.g. “i dont even drink or smoke ,cant say i miss this”).
Comments were selected randomly from each thematic category.
Desire to Drink
The desire to drink was measured using one item (France et al., 2014). After each ad
exposure, participants were asked if the ad would increase or decrease the desire to drink in an
individual like them. Responses were captured on a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from definitely
decrease (coded as 0) to definitely increase (coded as 4). The reference frame “an individual like
them” was used to separate the issue from the participant and elicit a more reliable response
(Bradburn, Sudman, & Wansink, 2004). Four desire to drink measurements, one per ad, were
recorded per participant.

Alcohol Use
Past year alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test
(AUDIT) (Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de al Fuente, & Grant, 1993). The AUDIT consisted of 10
questions that measured past year alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence symptoms, and
harmful alcohol use (α = 0.83). Possible AUDIT scores range from 0 to 40 with scores ≤ 7
indicating abstinence or low risk drinking, scores from 8-15 indicating hazardous drinking, scores
from 16-19 indicating harmful alcohol use, and scores ≥ 20 indicating possible alcohol dependence
(Babor, & Robaina, 2016).
Covariates
Participants answered several demographic (i.e. age, sex, race, ethnicity, household
income, marital status) and Facebook involvement questions.

Facebook involvement was

measured using a 29-item questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model that was
developed specifically for use with Facebook (α = 0.93) (Rauniar, Rawaski, Yang, & Johnson,
2014). This measure was included to control for familiarity, use, and trust of Facebook.
Study Procedure
The study was conducted online. Participants consented to participate through affirmation
after reading a study description. Then, participants were randomized into one of the four
experimental, between-subjects groups (i.e. high user engagement/pro-drinking UGCs, high user
engagement/anti-drinking UGCs, low user engagement/pro-drinking UGCs, low user
engagement/anti-drinking UGCs) and viewed the four experimental beer ads. A Latin Square
design was implemented to ensure that each group viewed the ads in a unique order. After viewing
each ad, participants completed a questionnaire that contained the desire to drink question. Once

all ads were viewed and related questions answered, participants completed a questionnaire
containing demographic, Facebook involvement, and AUDIT questions. The UConn Health
Institutional Review Board approved this procedure as an exempt protocol.
Statistical Analysis
All continuous variables were considered normally distributed after an examination of their
distributions for skewness and kurtosis. Differences in demographic variables across study groups
were assessed using t-tests and chi-square analysis. Statistical significance of main and interactive
effects of user engagement values, UGCs, and AUDIT scores were assessed using generalized
linear mixed models (GLMM), which is an extension of general linear models that adjusts for
correlated outcomes that originate from the same participant. The Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess relative model fit. Models
with minimum AIC and BIC scores were preferred.
AUDIT scores were dichotomized to categorize participants as either abstinent/low-risk
drinkers (i.e. scores ≤ 7) or higher-risk drinkers (i.e. scores > 7). Unadjusted and adjusted GLMM
models were specified. The unadjusted model included user engagement values, UGCs, AUDIT
category, and all interactions between these three variables (i.e. user-engagement x UGCs, user
engagement x AUDIT category, UGCs x AUDIT category, user-engagement x UGCs x AUDIT
category). User engagement, UGCs, and AUDIT categories were simple contrast coded, with high
user engagement values, pro-drinking UGCs, and higher-risk drinkers coded as ½. Low user
engagement values, anti-drinking UGCs, and abstinent/low-risk drinkers were coded as -½.
The adjusted model included age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, marital status, and Facebook
involvement as covariates. Age, income, and Facebook involvement were considered continuous
variables. Sex and ethnicity were dummy coded dichotomous variables where males and non-

Hispanic were the reference categories. Due to lower AIC and BIC scores, the race variable was
dichotomized into Caucasians and non-Caucasians, then dummy coded with Caucasians as the
reference group. Using similar criteria, the marital status variable was specified as a dummy coded
four level categorical variable (i.e. single, never married; married, domestic partnership, widowed,
divorced), and divorced was the reference category.
Significant interactions that have not been previous explored were investigated by first
identifying all possible groups created by the interacting variables. For example, a significant user
engagement x UGC interaction would create four groups: high user engagement/pro-drinking
UGCs, high user engagement/anti-drinking UGCs, low user engagement/pro-drinking UGCs, low
user engagement/anti-drinking UGCs. New models were then specified using each new group as
the reference group. For a 2-way interaction, the procedure would result in four additional GLMM
models being specified.
Only participants with complete data were included in the analysis (n = 118). All models
were specified with a normal distribution and an identity link function. Statistical significance was
set at α = 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 22.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM
Corp.).
Results
Mean age was 22.7 years (SD = 1.1); mean household income was approximately $40,000
per year (SD = $30,000), and mean Facebook involvement score was 82.2 (SD = 16.5).
Participants were predominantly Caucasian (67.8%), non-Hispanic (86.4%), and single, never
married (89%) (Table 1). A slight majority were male (51.7%). Mean AUDIT score was 5.7 (SD
= 5.9) and 30% of participants were categorized as higher-risk drinkers (i.e. AUDIT score > 7)

(Table 1). There were no significant differences in the demographic variables between study
groups (p’s > 0.05).

The AIC and BIC values of the unadjusted model were 1198.1 and 1214.5, respectively.
Slight improvement was noted in the adjusted model, where the AIC and BIC were 1197.0 and
1214.4, respectively. Therefore, the estimates of the adjusted model were interpreted. AUDIT
category was positively associated with the desire to drink (p < 0.001) (Table 2). The user
engagement by UGC interaction (p = 0.049) and the UGC by AUDIT category interaction (p =
0.029) were also statistically significant. The main effects of user engagement and UGCs, along
with the user engagement by AUDIT category and the user engagement by UGC by AUDIT
category interactions were not statistically significant (p’s > 0.05).

The UGC by AUDIT category interaction was investigated by first identifying all possible
groups created from these two variables. The groups included: pro-drinking UGCs/high risk
drinking, anti-drinking UGCs/high risk drinking, pro-drinking UGCs/low risk drinking, and antidrinking UGCs/low risk drinking. Four additional GLMM models were specified with each new
group acting as the reference group in one of the models (Table 3). The desire to drink was greater

among higher-risk drinkers regardless of the type of UGCs participants were exposed to (p’s <
0.001 to p = 0.029). Additionally, pro-drinking UGCs increased the desire to drink among lowrisk drinkers (p < 0.001) but had no effect among higher-risk drinkers (p = 0.989). The user
engagement by UGC interaction within this dataset has been investigated elsewhere and the
analyses were not duplicated here (Noel, & Babor, 2018). Briefly, pro-drinking UGCs were
associated with an increased desire to drink but only in the presence of high user engagement
levels.

Discussion
The findings support the study hypotheses in part and reject the hypotheses in part.
Supportive findings include the suggestion that the desire to drink increases in higher-risk drinkers
after exposure to a social media alcohol advertisement solely due to the ad itself. Moreover, prodrinking user-generated comments may increase the desire to drink among low-risk drinkers or
those who are abstinent. However, the hypothesis that user engagement values would influence
the desire to drink was not supported.
The increased desire to drink among high risk drinkers is consistent with previous research
concluding that reactions to alcohol cues are stronger among moderate and heavy drinkers
compared to non-drinkers or light drinkers (Bordnick et al., 2008; Eddie et al., 2013; Lee et al.,
2008; Reid et al., 2006). The results are also consistent with the growing literature demonstrating
that alcohol advertisements can elicit strong reactions, in addition to generic alcohol cues (e.g. a
glass of beer). For instance, exposure to print alcohol ads significantly increased skin conductance
in a sample of moderate drinking undergraduate students, indicating anticipation of the alcoholrelated stimuli (Cassisi et al., 1998). Viewing social media alcohol ads may also activate the
reward pathways of the brain, which has been previously correlated with self-reported drinking
behaviors (Courtney et al., 2018; de Sousa Fernandes Perna et al., 2017).
Furthermore, the lack of response among higher-risk drinkers to user-generated comments
is consistent with research demonstrating that moderate and heavy alcohol users principally focus
on the primary alcohol stimulus, in this case the alcohol ad, and typically ignore peripheral
information (Ingjaldsson et al., 2003a; Ingjaldsson et al., 2003b). Previous research suggests that
this effect may be greatest among youth and young adults. Greater attentional biases have been

documented in underage college drinkers (Ramirez et al., 2015), and young adult binge drinkers
may prioritize the processing of alcohol-related stimuli (Petit et al., 2012).
Conversely, the influence of user-generated comments among low-risk drinkers or those
who were abstinent may suggest that the comments are viewed as reflective of peer behavior, and
a stronger response towards increased alcohol consumption is warranted if group opinion is
generally favorable to the ad message. The association between pro-drinking messages on social
media and binge drinking intentions may be mediated by perceived injunctive norms (Yang &
Zhao, 2018), and others have postulated that reinforcement of social norms is an important
motivational factor for writing online comments (Rost, Stagel, & Frey, 2016). Indeed, social
media may be an ideal outlet for those with such desires
Implications
Exposure to alcohol advertising moderately increases alcohol consumption (Anderson, de
Bruijn, Angus, Gordon, & Hastings, 2009; Jernigan, Noel, Landon, Thornton, & Lobstein, 2017),
and there have been several recent calls for greater regulation of alcohol marketing, with specific
attention to alcohol marketing on social media platforms (Noel, & Babor, 2017; Noel et al., 2018).
Statutory regulations that place strict limitations on the content of alcohol advertising are likely
needed to limit the impact of social media alcohol advertising on higher-risk drinkers. Regulations
restricting user-generated comments may be needed to further protect low-risk drinkers and those
who choose to remain abstinent. In the absence of alcohol marketing regulations, pressure can be
applied to social media platforms to introduce new features that would allow users to “opt-in” or
“opt-out” of viewing certain content categories. Within the current context, social media users
would then have the option to view content published by alcohol brands.

Limitations
There are several limitations to the study. Study power may be limited due to the sample
size used, and an effect of user engagement values may be seen in larger studies. The results may
not be generalizable to other population groups, social media platforms, or product types, and
additional research is necessary to verify the reported findings. The study relied on self-report,
and due to the anonymous nature of AMT, it is not possible to independently verify participant
responses. Additionally, because the desire to drink measurement was a judgement of how others
may drink, it may be prone to social desirability bias.
It is not possible to know if the comments were truly written by Facebook users unaffiliated
with the included brands or brand representatives posing as Facebook users, although it is unlikely
that brand representatives wrote the comments used in the study. The pro-drinking comments may
expose the alcohol brands companies to civil or criminal liabilities should an injury occur as a
result of a Facebook user reading the comment, and the anti-drinking comments are unlikely to
originate from brand representatives by their nature. Furthermore, it is not known whether prodrinking user-generated comments increase the desire to drink, anti-drinking user-generated
comments decrease the desire to drink, or both mechanisms are at work because they were
compared against each other. Additional research is needed to understand the exact mechanism
of action. Finally, order effects may, in part, explain the results because while each group viewed
the ads in a different order, participants within the same group viewed the ads in the same order.
However, any biases would likely be towards the null due to respondent fatigue.

Conclusions
The desire to drink may significantly increase among higher-risk drinkers after exposure
to a social media beer advertisement. The desire to drink may also significantly increase among
low-risk drinkers or those who are abstinent if the advertisements are paired with pro-drinking
user-generated comments. Regulating the content of social media alcohol advertisements may
protect higher-risk drinkers, and regulating comments associated with social media alcohol
advertisements may offer additional protections for low-risk drinkers and those who are abstinent.
