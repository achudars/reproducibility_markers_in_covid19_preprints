More than 50 years after the U.S. Surgeon General's first report on cigarette smoking and mortality, smoking
remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable
causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second
level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with
smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the
Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death
rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and
by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer
mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual
smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes.
Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort
data that directly measure smoking status. The U.S. Surgeon General should reevaluate the evidence for the
additional causes and consider reclassifying them as causally attributable to smoking.

1. Introduction
More than 50 years after the U.S. Surgeon General's first report on
cigarette smoking and mortality, smoking remains the leading cause of
preventable death in the United States (GBD 2015 Tobacco
Collaborators, 2017; Rogers, Hummer, Krueger, & Pampel, 2005; U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services [U.S. DHHS] 2014). The
first Surgeon General's report concluded that evidence was sufficient to
infer that smoking is causally linked to lung cancer and chronic bronchitis among men and possibly linked to lung cancer among women
(U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1964). Subsequent
reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to
include cancers in several organs, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, respiratory diseases, and diabetes (U.S. DHHS 2014). In addition to the
first level of causes of death for which a causal association with
smoking is established, a second level includes additional causes of
death for which evidence is “suggestive but not sufficient” to infer a
causal relationship with smoking (U.S. DHHS 2014:3). Research has
found elevated mortality risk from these causes among smokers relative
to nonsmokers and identified routes by which the carcinogens and
other toxic substances in cigarette smoke could harm those parts of the
body. However, the evidence for these additional causes of death does

not yet meet the Surgeon General’s criteria for causality.
Two recent studies provide compelling evidence that these additional causes may in fact be attributable to smoking (Carter et al., 2015;
Lariscy, Hummer, & Rogers, 2018). Both studies find elevated risk of
death among current and former smokers compared with never smokers
for established and additional causes. These studies (and many others
assessing smoking-attributable mortality) use prospective cohort data,
in which survey respondents report their smoking behavior, and then
vital status is ascertained years later. This approach faces criticism
because survey respondents generally report current cigarette use
without providing lifelong smoking histories. A population’s smokingattributable deaths are a result of smoking patterns from 20–30 years
ago rather than current smoking prevalence (Lopez, Collishaw, & Piha,
1994; Pampel, 2005). Alternative approaches indirectly assess a population’s cumulative smoking burden using lung cancer mortality rates
(Peto, Lopez, Boreham, Thun, & Heath, 1992, 1994; Preston, Glei, &
Wilmoth, 2010a, 2010b). Additional techniques then determine the
proportion of smoking-related deaths from causes of death other than
lung cancer. Indirect approaches may be better able to measure cohorts’
full smoking histories and to account for the lag between a population’s
adoption of smoking and subsequent smoking-attributable mortality.
This study applies a cause-specific version of the indirect method

developed by Preston et al. (2010a, 2010b) to determine whether the
established and additional causes of death are attributable to smoking
among U.S. adults ages 50+. Specifically, I use the association between
lung cancer death rates and death rates from each established and additional cause to assess whether causes are attributable to smoking, and
if so, what fraction and number of deaths from each cause are attributable to smoking. Accurate estimation of smoking-attributable mortality by cause of death is important to determine the contribution of
smoking to sociodemographic disparities in population health (Denney,
Rogers, Hummer, & Pampel, 2010; Lariscy, Hummer, & Hayward, 2015;
Pampel, 2005) and the extent to which smoking explains inequalities in
life expectancy in international comparisons (Crimmins, Preston, &
Cohen, 2011; Rostron & Wilmoth, 2011).

young adulthood, but smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality
develop decades later (Pampel, 2005). Second, with cross-sectional
survey data linked to death records, respondents report their smoking
status at baseline, and changes in smoking status are not observed.
Mortality risk ratios may be biased if respondents’ smoking status
changes during the vital status follow-up period, whether nonsmokers
begin smoking, current smokers quit, or former smokers relapse
(Taylor, Hasselblad, Henley, Thun, & Sloan, 2002).
2.2. Estimating smoking-attributable mortality: Indirect method
The second approach for estimating smoking-attributable mortality
(hereafter, “indirect method”) uses a population’s lung cancer mortality
rate as a proxy for their cumulative tobacco burden. Lung cancer serves
as an indicator of a population’s smoking burden because smoking is
the main source of variation in lung cancer mortality, and 70–90% of
lung cancer deaths occur among smokers (Ezzati & Lopez, 2003; Thun
et al., 1997). In contrast, lung cancer deaths are rare among lifetime
nonsmokers (Thun et al., 2008). Indirect methods may be better able to
measure cohorts’ full smoking histories than direct methods.
One indirect approach developed by Peto et al. (1992, 1994; hereafter, “Peto-Lopez method”) uses the difference between a population’s
lung cancer death rate and the lung cancer death rate among lifetime
nonsmokers to estimate the proportion of a population exposed to
smoking. The method imports smoker-nonsmoker death rate ratios for
upper aerodigestive cancers, other cancers, COPD, and other medical
causes from the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) and applies them to
the population exposed to smoking. The cause-specific rate ratios are
reduced by half to account for possible confounding. No deaths from
liver cirrhosis, accidents, or violence are counted as attributable to
smoking. Researchers have used the Peto-Lopez method to estimate the
global impact of tobacco, examine mortality variation by country, and
project future trends in smoking-attributable mortality (Peto, Lopez,
Pan, Boreham, & Thun, 2015).
Another indirect method developed by Preston et al. (2010a, 2010b;
hereafter, “PGW method”) relies on the statistical association between
lung cancer mortality and mortality from all other causes of death
combined to estimate smoking-attributable mortality. Specifically, the
PGW method uses negative binomial regression to model death rates
from all causes other than lung cancer combined as a function of lung
cancer death rates and control variables (age, year, country, and interaction terms). They used data by sex and 5-year age group for 20
high-income countries at advanced stages of the tobacco epidemic
during 1950–2006. Cause-specific death counts came from the World
Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database and all-cause death
counts, population exposures, and death rates came from the Human
Mortality Database. This macrolevel model-based approach avoids the
need to import risk ratios from CPS-II. The resulting coefficients are
translated into smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) to indicate the
percentage of deaths due to smoking. Fenelon and Preston (2012) reestimated the PGW coefficients using U.S. data and controlling for state
of residence. The U.S. coefficients are better suited for the mature stage
of the tobacco epidemic occupied by the United States and correct for
implausibly high smoking-attributable mortality among older women
that stems from using the international data. Using U.S. coefficients,
Fenelon and Preston (2012) found that 21% (17%) of male (female)
deaths were attributable to smoking in 2004. To date, researchers have
used the PGW method to make international comparisons of smokingattributable mortality (Kelly & Preston, 2016; Preston et al., 2010a,
2010b; Rostron, 2010) and examine the contribution of smoking to
mortality disparities by race/ethnicity (Blue & Fenelon, 2011; Ho & Elo,
2013), educational attainment (Ho & Fenelon, 2015), and geographic
context (Fenelon, 2013; Fenelon & Preston, 2012).

2. Background
2.1. Estimating smoking-attributable mortality: Direct method
Two methodological approaches are used to estimate smoking-attributable mortality. One approach (hereafter, “direct method”) uses
survey data that directly measure smoking status and are prospectively
linked to death records to compare mortality risk among current and
former smokers with nonsmokers. The direct approach allows researchers to statistically adjust for individual characteristics that confound the smoking-mortality association such as sociodemographic
factors and other health risk behaviors. Rogers et al. (2005) used an
early version of the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality
Files (NHIS-LMF) data to compare all-cause adult mortality risk of
various smoker groups defined by different intensities and durations
with the risk among never smokers. They showed that mortality risk is
highest among current heavy smokers and that smoking cessation reduces mortality risk.
Studies that use the direct method to examine specific causes of
death generally focus on broad cause categories or only the causes established by the U.S. Surgeon General as being causally linked to
smoking (Doll, Peto, Boreham, & Sutherland, 2004; Hummer, Nam, &
Rogers, 1998; Rostron, 2013). These established causes include cancers
of the lung, lip and oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum,
liver, pancreas, larynx, cervix, urinary bladder, kidney and renal pelvis,
and bone marrow; ischemic heart disease; other heart diseases; stroke;
atherosclerosis; aortic aneurysm; other arterial diseases; pneumonia,
influenza, and tuberculosis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD); and diabetes (Doll et al., 2004; International Agency for
Research on Cancer, 2004; U.S. DHHS 2014).
Two recent studies go beyond the established causes of death to
examine additional causes for which the current evidence is suggestive
but not sufficient to infer a causal association with smoking. Carter
et al. (2015) compiled a list of such additional causes that includes
infections, breast cancer, prostate cancer, rare cancers, cancers of unknown site, hypertensive heart disease, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, respiratory diseases (other than pneumonia
and influenza), intestinal ischemia, liver cirrhosis, other digestive diseases, renal failure, additional rare causes combined, and deaths from
unknown causes. They found that smokers exhibit higher risk of mortality from these causes than never smokers, net of sociodemographic
and behavioral confounders. However, they analyzed five cohort samples that are disproportionately non-Hispanic white and college-educated. Lariscy et al. (2018) replicated and extended the study by Carter
and colleagues by using nationally-representative data (i.e., 1990–2011
NHIS-LMF) and controlling for additional risk factors.
Despite the insights obtained with the direct approach, it encounters
several issues. First, direct methods measure respondents’ current
smoking status, whereas smoking-attributable mortality results from
accumulated smoking burden. Most smokers initiate in adolescence or

2.3. Applying indirect estimation to smoking-attributable causes of death

cause-of-death codes across periods with greater variability in cause-ofdeath coding standards (Anderson, 2011; Preston et al., 2010a). I used
complete underlying cause-of-death codes, which include four-character codes with a decimal digit to indicate cause subcategories.
Appendix Table A1 lists the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for the established
and additional causes.

Preston et al. (2010a, 2010b) developed their method to examine
the association between lung cancer mortality and mortality from all
other causes of death combined, without the need to specify individual
causes of death other than lung cancer. As a sensitivity analysis to validate their approach, Preston et al. (2010a) examined the association
between lung cancer death rates and death rates for a few broad causeof-death categories. They showed that lung cancer mortality is strongly
correlated with mortality from respiratory diseases and smoking-related
cancers (i.e., categories established as causally associated with
smoking) and weakly or negatively correlated with mortality from
other cancers and external causes (i.e., categories not associated with
smoking). I extend their analysis by examining the correlation between
lung cancer death rates and death rates for specific causes of death,
including the established causes acknowledged by the U.S. Surgeon
General and the additional causes Carter and colleagues (2015) compiled. In sum, my application of the PGW indirect method to specific
causes of death offers a unique opportunity to assess whether the additional causes of death are attributable to smoking and to estimate the
fraction and number of excess deaths due to smoking overall and by
cause in the United States.

3.3. Analytic approach

3. Material and methods

I applied a cause-specific version of the PGW indirect method,
which fits negative binomial models to predict the logged mortality rate
of each cause of death other than lung cancer, using lung cancer mortality rate (per 1000), age, period, and U.S. division as independent
variables. I modified the original PGW model in two ways to correct for
the implausibly high mortality among older women produced by the
original PGW model. First, I excluded adults aged 85+ from negative
binomial models and then used the average of the coefficients for ages
70–74, 75–79, and 80–84 as the coefficient at ages 85+ to estimate
SAFs (Preston et al., 2010b). Second, I added an age-by-time interaction
term, which makes PGW results more consistent with published estimates (Rostron, 2010).
I estimated the association between death rates for each cause of
death other than lung cancer and death rates for lung cancer with the
following negative binomial model:

This study drew on vital statistics data for U.S. adults aged 50+ in
1980–2004. Mortality data came from the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER 2016), which harmonizes Multiple Cause-of-Death files
available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS 2004).
Population denominators for death rates came from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, National Cancer
Institute (NCI 2016), which harmonizes data from the U.S. Census
Bureau. I calculated lung cancer death rates (per 1000) for sex-, age-,
year-, and division-specific groups. Analyses were based on about 48
million deaths and over 1.7 billion person-years.

where ln(Mc) is the logged mortality rate for cause of death c, ML is the
lung cancer mortality rate, Xa is a series of dummy variables for age
group, Xt is a series of dummy variables for period, Xd is a series of
dummy variables for division, and t is a linear period term. The model
includes an age-by-lung cancer death rate interaction term, a time-bylung cancer death rate interaction term, and an age-by-time interaction
term. Beta coefficients accompany each first-order and interaction term.
The negative binomial models include a statistical offset of the natural
log of exposure to model the logged rates for each cause of death other
than lung cancer.
I calculated the fraction of lung cancer deaths attributable to
smoking (AL) with the following formula:

3.2. Measures
Cause-specific models adjusted for age, period, and U.S. division of
residence. I stratified analyses by sex throughout given sex differences
in smoking prevalence and mortality risk (Preston & Wang, 2006;
Rogers & Powell-Griner, 1991). I recoded age into five-year groups
50–54 through 85+. Adults ages 50+ were selected because lung
cancer deaths are rare before age 50, and the PGW method relies on the
association between lung cancer and other causes of death to estimate
smoking-attributable mortality. Period was based on years 1980–2004
and recoded into five-year periods. Other applications of the PGW
method have used individual years, but I combined years to produce
stable mortality rates for rare causes of death. I grouped the 50 U.S.
states (excluding the District of Columbia and U.S. territories) into nine
divisions (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) to account for geographic clustering of smoking-attributable mortality (Fenelon, 2013; Fenelon &
Preston, 2012). Although divisional differences are not a focus of this
study, I adjusted for division to approximate the U.S.-based PGW model
by Fenelon and Preston (2012). Geographic information is not available
in public-use U.S. mortality data after 2004.
I coded the established and additional smoking-attributable causes
of death based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 cause-of-death codes (WHO, 2010).
ICD-9 was implemented in 1979 and ICD-10 was implemented in 1999.
I harmonized the two ICD versions with guidelines by Anderson,
Miniño, Hoyert, and Rosenberg (2001). Although data are available for
previous ICD versions, going back earlier would require harmonizing

from the lung cancer first-order term, age-by-lung cancer interaction
term, and time-by-lung cancer interaction term in formula (1):
Lc = L + aL + tL . I estimated 34 different sets of age-specific Lc
values, a set for each smoking-attributable cause other than lung cancer
for women and men. Using Lc values, I estimated the fraction of deaths
attributable to smoking from cause c other than lung cancer (Ac) with
the formula:

where DL equals the number of lung cancer deaths, Dc equals the
number of deaths from each established and additional cause c other
than lung cancer, and D denotes total deaths. I multiplied the number of
deaths from each cause in 2000–2004 by the corresponding SAF and
then divided by five to produce the average annual number of deaths
from each cause that are attributable to smoking in the five-year period
2000–2004. I obtained the number of deaths from each cause and all
causes in years 2000–2004 from the NBER harmonized files of the
NCHS Multiple Cause-of-Death Files (NBER 2016; NCHS 2004). Moreover, I used the numerator of formula 4 to estimate the annual number
of excess deaths by cause in 2000–2004 that could have been averted in
the absence of smoking.

(3)

This formula combines the effect of smoking on lung cancer mortality (indicated by the difference in the observed lung cancer mortality
rate and the expected lung cancer mortality rate among nonsmokers)
with the association between lung cancer mortality and mortality from
cause c (represented by Lc ) to estimate the fraction of deaths from
cause c due to smoking.
Although the coefficients and SAFs for specific causes of death are
informative for determining whether the causes are associated with
lung cancer mortality (i.e., evidence that they are attributable to
smoking), other population health metrics more effectively convey the
impact of smoking on adult mortality (Rogers et al., 2005). Translating
the coefficients into the fraction of all deaths due to smoking and the
annual number of excess deaths due to smoking provides more intuitive
indicators of the loss of life that would have been prevented in the
absence of cigarette smoking. The fraction of deaths attributable to
smoking (A) is a weighted average estimated with the following formula:

of death
Tables 2 and 3 show age-specific and mean coefficients for causespecific death rates regressed on lung cancer death rates among women
and men, respectively. Nearly all coefficients for both established and
additional causes are positive, suggesting that some portion of deaths
from these causes are attributable to smoking. Coefficients vary considerably; among women, the largest coefficients occur for COPD, laryngeal cancer, and esophageal cancer (established causes) and

intestinal ischemia and essential hypertension/hypertensive renal disease (additional causes). Among men, the largest coefficients occur for
COPD and aortic aneurysm (established causes) and liver cirrhosis (an
additional cause). Coefficients often differ by sex but are not consistently higher for either group; coefficients are higher among men for
some causes but higher among women for other causes.
Age-specific and mean coefficients are negative for some causes of
death and age groups. Although seemingly anomalous, negative coefficients generally occur for causes with multiple risk factors. Among
women, these causes include cancer of the stomach, liver, or cervix;
liver cirrhosis; and unknown causes. Among men, these causes include
liver cancer, additional rare causes combined, and unknown causes.
Liver cancer and cirrhosis are associated with heavy alcohol use, stomach and liver cancer are linked to obesity, and additional rare causes
combined and unknown causes have numerous risk factors other than
smoking. Coefficients tend to decrease with increasing age and, for
some causes of death, fall below zero. Negative coefficients may occur
among older adults for selected causes because they experience higher
death rates overall.

women (61%) and men (43%), laryngeal cancer among women (45%),
and aortic aneurysm among men (45%). Among additional causes, SAFs
are large for intestinal ischemia among women (44%) and liver cirrhosis among men (47%). SAFs for some additional causes are as large
as or larger than SAFs for established causes.
Examining the SAF for all established and additional causes combined (A) showed that 15% of female deaths and 22% of male deaths
were due to smoking among U.S. adults at ages 50+ in 1980–2004. In
supplemental analyses, I estimated SAFs following the original PGW
method (i.e., regressing death rates from all causes of death other than
lung cancer combined on death rates from lung cancer). This approach
found that 17% (24%) of female (male) deaths were attributable to
smoking in 1980–2004. Thus, the cause-specific indirect method produces only slightly lower estimates than the original PGW method.
4.3. Annual number of excess deaths by cause attributable to smoking,
2000–2004
I estimated the annual number of excess deaths due to smoking for
each established and additional cause in 2000–2004 by multiplying the
cause-specific SAFs (Ac and AL) by the corresponding number of deaths
from each cause (Dc and DL) in years 2000–2004 divided by five
(Table 5). The indirect method finds that 420,284 annual deaths would
have been averted in the absence of smoking. The number of excess
deaths attributable to smoking is higher among men (253,041) than
women (167,243). The most sizable numbers of preventable deaths are
observed for the established causes lung cancer and ischemic heart
disease, which each account for more excess deaths than all additional

4.2. Cause-specific smoking-attributable fractions
Table 4 presents mean SAFs for each cause of death in 1980–2004.
SAFs calculated from negative coefficients are also negative, so I set
negative mean SAFs to zero. The largest cause-specific SAFs are for lung
cancer (83% among women and 87% among men), affirming that the
majority of lung cancer deaths are attributable to smoking in the United
States. Among established causes, SAFs are large for COPD among

causes combined. Although the additional causes account for fewer
deaths individually compared with the established causes, when accumulated, the additional causes account for 60,418 deaths (18,006
among women and 42,412 among men), or about 14% of all smokingattributable deaths.
I compared these indirect estimates to estimates using the direct
method and NHIS-LMF data (Lariscy et al., 2018) to determine whether
indirect and direct methods produce similar results. Lariscy and colleagues used data from the 1990–2011 NHIS-LMF and controlled for
several sociodemographic and behavioral confounders. They estimated
the annual number of smoking-attributable deaths at ages 35+ in 2010.
However, I recalculated their annual number of excess deaths for ages
50+ in 2000–2004 to match the ages and period of my indirect method
estimates. The direct method identified 486,476 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ in 2000–2004. Among women and men, the
indirect method estimate is lower than the direct method estimate.

5. Discussion

that include the entire population and covers a 25-year period. In
contrast, prospective cohort studies rely on sample data that exclude
certain segments of the U.S. population. For example, the NHIS-LMF is
nationally-representative but excludes the institutionalized population
whereas the CPS-II is not nationally-representative and is disproportionately non-Hispanic white and college-educated (Lariscy
et al., 2018; Malarcher et al., 2000). Finally, it produces new estimates
of the annual number of excess deaths overall and by cause of death

This study makes several important contributions to the study of
smoking-attributable mortality by cause of death in the United States.
First, it is the first application of the PGW indirect method to examine a
comprehensive list of smoking-attributable causes of death. The evidence for many of these causes is currently suggestive but not sufficient
to infer a causal association with smoking. Second, it draws on U.S. data

6

SSM - Population Health 7 (2019) 100349

that would have been averted in the absence of smoking, which are
lower than estimates from the direct method.
My results contribute to the mounting evidence supporting a causal
association between smoking and the additional causes of death. Both
the indirect and direct approaches suggest that several additional
causes are attributable to smoking. Carter et al. (2015) and Lariscy et al.
(2018) used the direct method with prospective cohort data to compare
cause-specific mortality risk among smokers relative to nonsmokers and
found that relative risks tend to be larger for established causes than
additional causes, but still significantly elevated. Likewise, the current
study uses the indirect method with vital statistics data to show that the
associations with lung cancer mortality rates tend to be larger for established causes than additional causes, but are still positive for nearly
all causes of death examined. This general agreement between the indirect and direct approaches confirms that the indirect method is a
valid alternative for estimating smoking-attributable mortality among
populations without survey data linked to death records but where
cause-of-death reporting in vital statistics data is available.
Despite the similarity between results from the direct and indirect
approaches, the comparison reveals that the direct method may be
better able to detect smoking-attributable causes of death that are also
linked to other risk factors than the indirect method. The PGW indirect
model produces negative mean coefficients for cancers of the stomach,
liver, and cervix among women and liver cancer among men, even
though the U.S. Surgeon General recognizes these causes of death as
causally linked to smoking. Using the direct method, Lariscy et al.
(2018) found mortality risk of current smokers, compared with never
smokers, to be 198% higher from liver cancer among men, 128% higher
for cervical cancer among women, and 92% higher for stomach cancer
among women.
The evidence that breast and prostate cancer (additional causes) are
linked to smoking presents an important new contribution. The coefficients are positive for breast and prostate cancer for all age groups,
and SAFs derived from those coefficients indicate that 12% (17%) of
breast (prostate) cancer deaths are due to smoking. Among U.S. women,
lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, and breast cancer is
the second leading cause of cancer death. Among U.S. men, lung cancer
is the leading cause of cancer death, and prostate cancer is the second
leading cause of cancer death (American Cancer Society, 2018). Although other social and biological risk factors account for the majority
of breast and prostate cancer deaths, my results add to the compelling
evidence indicating that smoking is causally related to breast and
prostate cancer.
Both the direct and indirect methods find that liver cirrhosis is
linked to smoking among men. In sensitivity analyses, Lariscy et al.
(2018) limited their sample to the 1997–2011 NHIS-LMF Sample Adult
Files to adjust for alcohol use and other socioeconomic and behavioral
confounders. Net of alcohol use, mortality risk for liver cirrhosis among
men was significantly elevated among current smokers (risk ratio =
3.29) and former smokers (risk ratio = 1.83) relative to nonsmokers.
Corresponding cirrhosis mortality risk ratios among women were not
statistically significant when models adjusted for alcohol use. In the
present study, cirrhosis mortality is positively associated with lung
cancer mortality for all age groups among men, but the association is
weakly positive or negative among women. This evidence that a portion
of cirrhosis deaths are linked to smoking among men has important
methodological implications for the Peto-Lopez indirect method. Recall
that the Peto-Lopez method assumes that no cirrhosis deaths are due to
smoking. Future applications of the Peto-Lopez method should import
smoker-nonsmoker risk ratios for cirrhosis mortality among men when
assessing the number and fraction of deaths due to smoking, with some
reduction to the risk ratio to account for confounding from heavy

alcohol use.
5.1. Limitations
Several limitations must be considered. First, the lag period between
cigarette smoke exposure and smoking-attributable death may differ for
lung cancer and other smoking-attributable causes of death. For instance, some heart diseases develop at younger ages than lung cancer.
Different lag periods could affect the age-specific coefficients between
lung cancer death rates and rates from other causes. This lag difference
could potentially be the reason for negative coefficients among some
causes of death. Fenelon and Preston (2012) address this possibility and
conclude that differential lags are most problematic for populations at
early stages of the tobacco epidemic but not for countries at an advanced stage like the United States. Second, the cause-specific PGW
approach relies on accurate and consistent cause-of-death coding on
death certificates. Although cause-of-death reporting quality is generally high in the United States (Mathers, Fat, Inoue, Rao, & Lopez,
2005), coding accuracy may vary by time, age, or region. This may
particularly be an issue among older decedents with multiple chronic
conditions. Finally, my findings are not conclusive evidence of causality
between smoking and the additional causes, but they contribute to the
mounting evidence that meets the Surgeon General’s criteria to infer a
causal association with smoking (U.S. DHHS 2004).
5.2. Conclusion
Despite declines in smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable
mortality since the Surgeon General’s first report, smoking continues to
kill nearly half a million American adults every year. Especially troubling, declines in youth smoking prevalence have stalled so that
smoking endures among U.S. adolescents and young adults. Even with
reductions in smoking prevalence, considerable smoking-attributable
mortality will continue well into the twenty-first century due to the
existing smoking burden among adults now and the decades-long lag
between smoke exposure and eventual morbidity and mortality from
smoking-attributable diseases (Nam, Rogers, & Hummer, 1996; Pampel,
2005). At the same time, encouraging research suggests that smoking
cessation greatly reduces and perhaps even erases the detrimental effects of smoking, especially if smokers quit at younger ages (Doll et al.,
2004; Jha et al., 2013). Tobacco control policies implemented to discourage smoking initiation and promote cessation will save lives well
into the future.
