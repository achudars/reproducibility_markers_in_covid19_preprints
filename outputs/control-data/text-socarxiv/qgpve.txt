Abstract
How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that
short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting and
sentiment. We code exposure to refugees at the settlement level using news reports
from state media, an independent online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher
anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on resettlement in 2016. The effect,
estimated between 1.7% and 3.6%, decreases sharply with distance from points of
exposure. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition party Jobbik gained, while the governing right-wing Fidesz party lost votes in
these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections, suggesting incumbents are
punished by voters in these settlements skeptical of immigration regardless of their
policy position. Survey data supports this finding of a competition among rightwing parties, as individuals in exposed settlements are more fearful of immigrants
and support more restrictive policies, though only if they identify as right-wing
partisans.

Introduction

While the issue of immigration has moved to the core of the European political conversation (de Vries, Hakhverdian, and Lancee 2013; Green-Pedersen and Otjes 2017), particularly since the 2015 European refugee crisis (Grande, Schwarzbözl, and Fatke 2018),
it is still unclear how actual experiences with refugees influence local residents. The issue remains salient, with UNHCR (2018) estimating 4.4 million newly displaced refugees
and asylum seekers world-wide in 2017 alone. Citizens’ reactions to refugee arrivals are
particularly important in contexts where the arrival of refugees and other immigrants is
viewed negatively by authorities. When governments scapegoat immigrants instead of
sanctioning positive engagement, this affects citizens’ views (Ivarsflaten 2005). In this
situation, polarizing rhetoric may shape the first impressions refugees make on natives.
With the rise of populist and radical right parties across Europe (Kaltwasser et al. 2017;
Bustikova 2017), an increasing number of governments mobilize against refugees, rendering encounters between refugees and natives problematic.
We present evidence that exposure to refugees during the 2015 European refugee crisis
affected political behavior in Hungary, which was at the center of the crisis both because
of the large number of refugees entering the country and its controversial politics of crisis
management. Recent scholarship has provided some evidence on attitudinal consequences
of proximity to refugee camps and UNHCR reception centers, referred to as hotspots
in the literature (Hangartner et al. 2018; Dinas et al., forthcoming; Steinmayr 2016;
Dustmann, Vasiljeva, and Damm 2018; Vertier and Viskanic 2018). The Hungarian case
differs significantly from these works because refugees were passing through the country in
an irregular manner and their interactions with locals were highly transient. In Greece, for
example, locals living near hotspots had little opportunity to have substantive interactions
with individuals because of the transitory nature of their stay (Dinas et al., forthcoming;
Hangartner et al. 2018). Yet the presence of refugees at the hotspots in general was a
long-term phenomenon as arrival numbers have remained high for years. In contrast,
many Hungarians were only exposed to refugees on a single occasion. The 2015 crisis was
the first time many Hungarians encountered non-European refugees and transformed the
issue of migration from near irrelevance into the central question of Hungarian politics
in the following years (Krekó and Enyedi 2018).The question was salient for voters as
the share of Hungarians who named immigration as one of the country’s most important
problems increased from close to zero in mid 2013 to over thirty percent in November
2015 (European Commission 2016). Meanwhile, the movement of refugees through the
country was highly volatile and uncertain, with border closures and the evolving European
political situation driving the movement of people through diverse parts of the country.
The country thus presents an ideal case to study the conditions under which even shortterm encounters may have long-lasting consequences.
The case also provides a unique opportunity to measure the consequences of exposure to the refugee crisis on citizens: shortly after the crisis, Hungary held a national
referendum on proposed EU refugee quotas. We use this data to measure the effect of
2

short-term contact with refugees on voting behavior at the settlement level. The results
of this referendum allow us to directly measure anti-refugee sentiment, in contrast with
previous studies which use far-right party outcomes as a proxy (Dinas et al., forthcoming;
Steinmayr 2016; Dustmann, Vasiljeva, and Damm 2018; Vertier and Viskanic 2018). As
the Hungarian government mobilized against the refugees, we can study the impact of
exposure during crisis in the unique context of strong anti-refugee sentiment among the
elite and political leadership of the country. We find a significant backlash effect: settlements exposed to the crisis were significantly more likely to vote against the EU quota
in the referendum.
Notably, both Hungary’s ruling right-wing Fidesz party and the far-right opposition
party Jobbik campaigned against refugees, a fact which we exploit to study potential motivations for changes in party choice. If voters exposed to the crisis express anti-refugee
policy preferences, both Jobbik and Fidesz (collectively the right-wing) are likely to gain
votes. If exposure induces resentment against the government, however, one would expect votes to flow from Fidesz to Jobbik. Using a difference-in-differences specification
to measures changes in party vote shares in settlements across the 2014 and 2018 parliamentary elections, we find evidence for the latter effect in exposed settlements, while the
right-wing as a whole sees no significant change in its share of the vote.
We find further evidence that exposure influences voting behavior only within the
right-wing using survey data. At the individual level, only right-wing partisans are significantly more likely to express anti-refugee policy preferences and worries in exposed
settlements. These heterogeneous effects indicate more specifically how voting behavior
responds to exposure in crisis.
We first outline the theoretical relevance of the underlying mechanisms and review
related work. After describing the specifics of our case, we present our data and modelling
strategy. We then proceed to test the impact of short-term exposure to refugees in
different settings: its effect on voting in a national anti-refugee referendum, the electoral
gains of two anti-refugee parties (one in government, one in opposition) in parliamentary
elections before and after the crisis, and individual-level survey responses collected shortly
after the crisis.

Motivation, Theory and Related work

The so-called 2015 European refugee crisis has led to renewed interest in how natives react
to the arrival of immigrants and refugees both attitudinally and in their political behavior.
The crisis has drastically increased the number of arrivals to Europe and changed patterns
of interactions between natives and new arrivals. Many classic studies build on the contact
theory by Allport (1954) which posits that social interactions can lead to a reduction of
prejudices (see also: Pettigrew et al. 2011). Recent work reinvigorates that this proposed
virtuous outcome of contact with differences may require some qualifications (Paluck,
Green, and Green 2018), for example that contact persists over some extended period of
time combined with positive sanctions from the authorities.
3

These conditions were certainly not met in Hungary during the crisis. As in other
so-called transit countries, refugees moved on as soon as they were able to, often only
spending days or even hours in a country. We suggest this time was too short to overcome
barriers of language and culture. While data from Eastern European countries on the
route taken by the refugees is limited, evidence from other regions supports this notion: in
a study of reactions to refugees in Austria, Steinmayr (2016, p. 23) argues that the arrival
of refugees to settlements created substantial anxiety which reduced only after refugees
had lived in the respective settlement for some time. While prejudice may be moderated
in the long run, short and involuntary encounters may even inflame prejudice (on the
difference between short- and long-term effects: Enos 2014).
In explaining why and when citizens may perceive refugees as a threat in the US
context, Hopkins (2010) shows that reactions to immigrants are most likely to be hostile
when communities experience a sudden influx of immigration and when national media
rhetoric presents this as a threat. He argues that citizens are typically unaware of immigration levels but that they are particularly sensitive to changes to these levels, which
he finds may lead to politicization of the topic (p. 42). In this case, local arrivals and
hostile national rhetoric combine to produce negative reactions to refugees.
In this context Hungary provides an interesting case: a significant amount of refugees
passed through the country in summer and autumn 2015 on their way to Western Europe, until the borders were sealed by a physical barrier in the fall. While Hungary
fits the situation outlined by Hopkins (2010) regarding the salience of anti-immigration
rhetoric (Bocskor 2018), exposure in most places was temporary. In many cases, refugees
merely passed settlements on their way out of the country. This situation provides a
test of the effects observed by Hopkins with a key difference: a subsequent return to the
previous level of immigrants.
We suggest that this reversion to the status quo does not change the substantive
effect on political behavior of residents of Hungarian settlements exposed to the crisis.
One likely contributing factor is the strong anti-refugee message in the public discourse
in the years following the crisis: the manner in which governments address the issue
of immigration has consequences for citizens’ attitudes on the issue (Hainmueller and
Hopkins 2014). Voters are susceptible to elite opinion leaders who are skeptical towards
immigration more generally (Ivarsflaten 2005). In this, Hungary is an extreme case as
Hungary’s governing elites actively promoted fears of refugees, for example by evoking
the idea of an “invasion”. The governing party and the most popular opposition party
at the time espoused anti-refugee positions, while Hungarian media rarely gave refugees
a voice (Bernáth and Messing 2016). As individuals interpret their personal experiences
through the lens of public discourse, short-term encounters, especially with groups of
refugees, will reify the framing of refugees as dangerous.
Several other studies have analyzed the political outcomes of the recent refugee crisis,
albeit with different results. Evidence from France (Vertier and Viskanic 2018) and Austria (Steinmayr 2016) exploiting quasi-random refugee settlement programs find support
for the contact hypothesis in the context of long-term contact. In both countries, settle4

ments receiving refugees were less likely to vote for the far-right in subsequent elections.
Short-term exposure during the crisis has been studied using data from the Greek islands.
Dinas et al. (forthcoming) find an increase in the vote share of the far-right Golden Dawn
on islands exposed to the refugee crisis. Hangartner et al. (2018) find more negative
attitudes towards refugees on the same islands in a survey fielded almost two years later.
The Hungarian case presents an opportunity to revisit two lines of research about the
effect of short term exposure on political behavior and to address gaps therein. One issue
with previous works cited above is they measure change in voting behavior using presidential or parliamentary votes for right-wing parties (Dinas et al., forthcoming; Steinmayr
2016; Dustmann, Vasiljeva, and Damm 2018; Vertier and Viskanic 2018). Though antiimmigration is a uniting element of right-wing party ideologies in Europe (Ivarsflaten
2008), citizens may vote for them for other reasons, for example because of their culturally conservative programs. As Hungary held a national referendum on a refugee related
policy question shortly after the crisis, we can examine the relationship between exposure
during the crisis and anti-refugee voting attitudes directly through voting behavior.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Hungarian settlements exposed to refugees during the crisis are
more likely to vote against refugee resettlement quotas in the 2016 referendum.
We assume experiences with refugees in local contexts serve as reference, tying the
crisis to everyday life. Even if refugees disappear within hours or days, it is not necessarily
personal experiences but the images and anecdotes of unfamiliar refugees in familiar
places that will later influence political attitudes on immigration. This familiarity does
not stop at the borders of individuals’ own settlement but also includes their immediate
surroundings and places residents frequently travel to. The media’s intense coverage of the
refugee crisis meant Hungarians also saw images of refugees in neighboring settlements,
even if they and their immediate social contacts did not directly witness the incident. All
Hungarians were exposed to the outlined negative rhetorical imagery. Whether citizens
living in settlements near the refugee routes personally saw refugees, heard about them
through their social networks, or saw what happened on state television, their familiarity
with the setting personalizes the events. Hence, we expect the effect of exposure to go
beyond the location of exposure itself and include nearby settlements.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): The effect of refugee exposure on political behavior extends to nearby
settlements and decreases with distance.
A second point of interest in this line of research we reevaluate is whether exposed
voters alter their voting behavior to punish the government or to support anti-immigration
policy. So far, studies can only indirectly control for this, e.g. by looking into the electoral
gains by other opposition parties. For example, Dinas et al. (forthcoming) argue that
votes for the Golden Dawn, a far-right opposition party in Greece, are policy-votes rather
than anti-government votes. In Hungary we can disentangle this question by comparing
the change in vote shares of Fidesz, the governing right-wing party, and Jobbik, a far-right
opposition party, across parliamentary elections from 2014 and 2018.
5

We suggest that the vote for the right-wing in settlements exposed to the crisis has
only a weak policy aspect. A key aspect of right parties’ capacity to benefit from shortterm exposure may be due to disappointment with governing parties. A study from Italy
indicates that settlements hosting more refugees were significantly less likely to support
Matteo Renzi’s proposed constitutional amendment, a referendum that had no direct
link to the refugee crisis (Bratti et al. 2017). While right-wing parties may benefit disproportionally, studies of right-wing populist parties have shown these parties frequently
claim that governing elites prioritize the interest of immigrants above those of the native
population (Mudde and Kaltwasser 2017, 14; Cleen 2017, 350). More generally, it is
difficult for governing parties to shift responsibility for immigration under their watch.
While Fidesz attempted to solve this dilemma by adopting a tough stance on immigrants
and trying to physically constrain immigrants to few places, exposed settlements were
the few places that nevertheless experienced the refugee crisis directly. Thus, citizens in
these settlements may be discontent with the government’s handling of the immigration
crisis and cast their ballot for the opposition Jobbik instead.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Jobbik, the anti-refugee party in opposition, gained votes relative
to Fidesz, the anti-refugee party in government, in settlements exposed to the crisis.
Given this hypothesis of a reshuffling of voters on the right, it is natural to ask if
there is heterogeneity in the effect of exposure based on partisanship. Evidence suggest
that voters adjust their views on immigration to the position of their party (Harteveld,
Kokkonen, and Dahlberg 2017) and individuals may resort to motivated reasoning based
on partisan ideology in their interpretation of experiences with immigrants. It is unclear
if the effect of exposure conforms to this observation.
In a study of extended contact (Homola and Tavits 2017) find that contact with
immigrants only reduces threat perceptions significantly for individuals with left-wing
attitudes because of their higher openess to change. When contact is passing, we suggest
that the opposite mechanism may apply. A brief experience may not impact left partisans
but reinforce the perception that outsiders are threatening which is associated with resistance towards change (Homola and Tavits 2017). More generally, recent evidence suggests
that inaccurate perceptions about the size of foreign-born populations are a consequence
of anti-refugee attitudes, and not their cause (Hopkins, Sides, and Citrin 2018). Thus,
citizens who are sceptical towards immigration may experience the refugee crisis as more
threatening. To borrow a term from Sniderman, Hagendoorn, and Prior (2004), we posit
that short exposure galvanizes constituencies already concerned with the topic. Given
that policy on immigration and refugees in Hungary is a significantly partisan issue and
has become increasingly so during the crisis, we propose that the anti-refugee reaction of
citizens to exposure to refugees during the crisis is a right-wing phenomenon.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): The effect of refugee exposure on political behavior depends on an
individual’s political attitudes. Short-term contact is more likely to induce anti-immigrant
sentiments in right-wing voters.

The Hungarian Case

Hungary is more ethnically homogeneous than most other European countries. The
most common immigrants to Hungary are ethnic Hungarians coming from neighboring
countries. Since 1990 immigration to Hungary has functioned, both formally and informally, as a two track system distinguishing between ethnic Hungarians and other immigrants (Nyı́ri 2003; Bocskor 2018). This framework reflects the negative Hungarian attitude towards refugees in particular and non-Hungarian immigrants in general (Simonovits
et al. 2016; Enyedi, Fábián, and Sik 2005; Messing and Ságvári 2016). Immigration of
non-Hungarians was not previously a significant topic in Hungarian politics. However,
nation and nationality were salient topics in other regards e.g. the question of citizenship
for ethnic Hungarians from abroad (Batory 2010). While certain ethnic groups certainly
have advantages in questions of immigration in all European states, the institutionalized
two-tier system in Hungary facilitates xenophobia, for example against the small Chinese
and Vietnamese immigrant communities (Nyı́ri 2003). Indeed, in a comparative analysis
using the European Social Survey, Bail (2008) finds that in Hungary symbolic boundaries, conceptual distinctions used by majority groups to construct notions of “us” and
“them”, have the strongest racial component of all 21 countries. This fertile ground of
ethnic prejudice may have been amplified by media reporting about the crisis, similar to
how anti-Roma discourse has entered the mainstream (Vidra and Fox 2014).

3.1

2015 Refugee Crisis

The importance of immigration as a political issue in Hungary changed drastically in
2015, as rising immigration numbers and attacks in western Europe led to the political
mobilization of the topic on the right. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán began to
frame immigration as a threat to Hungary in January 2015 in the aftermath of the attack
on Charlie Hebdo. The government mailed a “national consultation” questionnaire to
each Hungarian citizen on the subjects of immigration and terrorism. The questionnaire
was criticized for its leading questions and its framing of the issue1 .
While immigration numbers had been on the rise since 2014, it was only in summer
2015 that refugee traffic reached its high point and that the issue gained traction with
the wider public. As Hungary was the first Schengen country before destination countries
like Austria and Germany on the so-called Balkan Route, a land route taken by refugees
from Greece, nearly 400,000 refugees were registered in Hungary in 2015. Most arrived in
August, September and October and were not able to continue their journey at first, due
to the EU’s Dublin Regulation which required refugees to apply for asylum in the first
Member State they reached. We visualize the number of refugees entering Hungary in
2015 in Figure 1. The majority of these refugees entered at the Serbian border, making
1. For example: “Do you think that Hungary could be the target of an act of terror in the next few
years?” and “We hear different views on the issue of immigration. There are some who think that
economic migrants jeopardise the jobs and livelihoods of Hungarians. Do you agree?”

this area a frequent focus of public debate.
For the Hungarian government, decreasing migration became a central goal. This was
realized through the construction of a fence along the borders with Serbia and Croatia.
When the fence along the Serbian border was completed on September 18th 2015, the
Hungarian authorities closed the border, diverting the refugees through Croatia. One
month later, that border was closed too. Afterwards, very few refugees entered Hungary
as the government drastically restricted the number of legal entries via so-called “transit
zones” at the border. However, public discussion regarding how to deal with refugees
and how to manage Hungary’s border has continued since then as the centerpiece of the
ruling party’s political discourse.

3.2

Political Consequences and the 2016 Quota Referendum

With its restrictive immigration policy and intensive mobilization around the issue (Bocskor 2018), the governing Fidesz party created a strong link between the prevailing political cleavages and immigration. Immigration had previously been a marginal issue in
Hungarian party competition with cultural competition centered around nationalism and
cultural liberalism (Gessler and Kyriazi, forthcoming). After the 2014 election, Fidesz
faced increasing pressure from the right, with the oppositional far-right party Jobbik
gaining popularity (Batory 2016; Bustikova 2017). As Fidesz actively competed for a farright electorate by enhancing policies that originated from Jobbik (Pirro, forthcoming;
Szalai and Göbl 2015), the immigration issue (on which there was no clear issue ownership given its low salience) provided fertile ground for an outbidding regarding restrictive
policy proposals between both parties.
8

Originally, discussion centered around border security. After the closing of the borders,
political discussion continued regarding the European level and the European Union’s
proposed quota-based refugee allocation scheme. According to this scheme, Hungary
would be responsible for hosting 1294 refugees. A referendum on the policy was originally
proposed by Jobbik in parliament in November 2015, however, the proposal was not
advanced. Fidesz also opposed the quota but only announced a referendum in February
2016, to be held in October, a year after refugee arrivals to Hungary had effectively
ended. The campaign was centered on presenting immigration as a risk to the Hungarian
population. Since the referendum required 50% participation to be valid, opposition
parties encouraged voters to stay home or to cast an invalid ballot. Ultimately, 41% of
eligible voters cast a valid ballot and of those 98% voted “No”, i.e. against the EU quota.
Since then, the Hungarian government has held additional “national consultations”
and the topic has remained on the agenda up to and beyond the 2018 parliamentary
election (Krekó and Enyedi 2018; Bocskor 2018; Gessler 2017). Competition between
Fidesz and Jobbik has remained a driving force of this conflict with both espousing policies to curb immigration. In the context of our study, this means both gained different
credentials on the immigration issue: while Fidesz was able to build a track-record of implementing restrictive policies, Jobbik may at times have increased its profile by attacking
domains in which Fidesz did not advance new policies, e.g. the country’s residency bond
scheme that gives residence permits in exchange for buying government bonds (Jacoby
and Korkut 2016; Halmai 2017).

Data and Measurement

To test our hypotheses, we collected data on the presence of refugees in Hungarian settlements during the peak crisis months in 2015 from three media sources. We relate this
to political outcomes while controlling for several potential confounding factors at the
settlement level. When using survey data to test heterogeneity of the treatment effect on
individuals, we also employ individual-level controls.

4.1

Exposure to refugees

We collected data on the presence and movement of refugees during the crisis from three
sources: MTI, the Hungarian state newswire, Index, a popular online news outlet independent from the government, and LiveUAMap (Live Universal Awareness Map), a
crowdsourced real-time social media aggregator with geographic information including
pictures and videos. Though most of the activity on LiveUAMap relates to the conflicts
in Ukraine and Syria, there is also data on the events of the European refugee crisis.
It has been used in qualitative studies of the paths taken by refugees on their way to
Europe (Proglio 2018).
We coded that significant refugee contact took place in a settlement if it was reported in any of the three sources. For example, we include all the settlements along the
9

“March of Hope”, a widely reported incident often cited as the climax of the crisis in Hungary (Kallius, Monterescu, and Rajaram 2016). On September 4th, thousands of refugees
at Budapest’s Keleti train station, which was closed to international travel because of
the crisis, began walking towards Austria along the M1 highway, disrupting traffic on one
of the largest highways in the country. Later that same evening, the Hungarian government decided to bus the refugees to the Austrian border. Soon afterwards, chancellor
Angela Merkel signaled that the refugees would be allowed to come to Germany. We
also coded smaller scale events throughout the country, including similar marches from
the Vámosszabadi refugee camp in the northwest to the Austrian border, and from the
Croatian border to the train station in Nagykanizsa in the southwest. In total we label
51 settlements as treated. We visualize the geographic distribution of refugee contact in
Figure 2.

Though we do not claim that we have identified every location of contact between
Hungarians and refugees during the crisis, we do suggest that our data describes those
locations in which Hungarians had a significantly higher likelihood of seeing unfamiliar
refugees in a familiar context. Survey data from January 2016 indicates that individuals
in such settlements are significantly more likely to report having encountered a refugee in
the past year. This relationship holds even when controlling for whether the individual
reports knowing a foreigner personally and whether he or she lives near a border, see
Table 7 in the Appendix. Finally, we note that we have excluded Budapest as datapoint
from our empirical analysis because it is an outlier in several dimensions including popu10

lation, density, diversity, and wealth, and because treatment in the city itself was highly
heterogeneous.

4.2

Dependent Variables

In our empirical analysis we analyze three different types of political outcomes: settlementlevel outcomes of the quota referendum, settlement-level election results in the following
general election in April 2018, and individual responses to a survey on migration-related
topics conducted in January 2016. We report summary statistics of all variables used in
our models in the Appendix, see Table 4 and Table 6.
We plot the distribution of our primary dependent variable, the number of no votes
cast in the referendum over the eligible voting population in a settlement, in Figure 3.
Given the boycott strategy of the opposition discussed before, we believe this is a more
appropriate measure of the anti-refugee outcome than considering the share of votes
against the quota. We note that there is significant variance between cities. We visualize
the geographic distribution of the referendum outcomes in Figure 5 in the Appendix. In
a second specification, we measure the electoral effects of contact with refugees on party
outcomes at the settlement level. Immigration was a major topic of the 2018 election
particularly for Fidesz and Jobbik, leading us to use the share of Fidesz, Jobbik, and
both combined as dependent variables.
In the individual-level specification, we use data from a survey of the general population of Hungary in January 2016. Specifically, we rely on a rotating module of a
repeatedly asked questionnaire of TARKI, a Hungarian social research institute. After
excluding respondents from Budapest, we are left with a sample of 772 respondents,
105 of which live in treated settlements. We analyze a battery of attitudinal and policy
11

questions that are included in the Appendix and discussed in more detail in the results
section. Given the skew of the answers towards anti-refugee attitudes, we dichotomize
responses into absolute rejection and more moderate attitudes.

4.3

Control Variables

We collected socio-economic data for all Hungarian settlement to rule out some potential
confounding factors. Many studies have shown that economically vulnerable populations
are more likely to vote for radical right and anti-immigrant parties (Betz 1994; Fitzgerald
and Lawrence 2011). Lower levels of education have also been shown to relate to political
hostility towards foreigners (Hjerm 2001). We therefore control for each settlement’s
income per capita, unemployment rate, and share of population with a high school degree
in 2016, the year of the referendum. We also include logged population size to control
for the size of the settlement.
Additionally, we consider voting data from the previous parliamentary elections in
2014 to account for prevailing local political allegiances. Because they both endorsed
and campaigned for the ’no’ camp, we include the share of votes received by Jobbik and
Fidesz in 2014 in our models.
As we are also interested in potential spillovers of the contact effect to nearby settlements, we use a matrix of inter-settlement travel distances (in minutes by car) to
calculate the distance of each settlement to the nearest point of refugee contact2 . As issues of migration may be more salient near borders, we also note if a settlement is within
25 kilometers of a border.

4.4

Estimation strategies

To measure the anti-refugee sentiment at the settlement level we use the ratio of ’no’
votes to the eligible voting population at the 2016 referendum as a dependent variable Yi ,
the distribution of which we show in Figure 3. Ti is a dummy variable with a value of 1 if
we code refugee contact in a settlement, Zi denotes our matrix of settlement-level control
variables, including pre-referendum settlement-level party preferences, population, and
socio-economic factors. i is an independent error term, assumed normally distributed
with mean 0. In the first extension of the baseline model, we introduce a geographical
dummy Di for settlements within 25 kilometers of any border and county fixed effects ψi
to control for geographic effects like different settlement structures.
Yi = αi + δ1 Ti + β2 Zi + β3 Di + ψi + i

(1)

We also measure the spillover effect of the treatment to nearby settlements using
continuous distance measures to the nearest treated settlement in travel minutes. In
order to examine the effect of treatment in terms of distance, our final model estimating
a settlement’s referendum outcome bins observations into categories according to their
2. The results presented are robust to considering geographic distance instead.

12

distance in travel time from the nearest treated settlement, with treated settlements taken
as the reference category.
To address the electoral effects of the refugee crises on parties we use a difference-indifferences estimation strategy. Specifically, we measure the effect of treatment during
the crisis on vote shares of right-wing parties between the 2014 and 2018 Hungarian
parliamentary elections. The specification constructs a counterfactual estimation of the
change in vote shares in treated settlements using changes in vote shares in untreated
settlements over the same period. Two factors threaten a causal interpretation of the
resulting estimates: 1) if the parallel trends assumption that party vote shares would
have followed the same trend in all settlements had the refugee crisis not occurred, and
2) if treated and untreated settlements differ in ways that could affect their response to
treatment.
To address the first concern, namely to assess whether the parallel trends assumption
holds, we carry out and report a placebo test for differences in party vote shares between
the 2010 and 2014 elections. To address the second concern, we use a kernel-based
propensity matching strategy (d’Agostino 1998; Stuart et al. 2014) to compare settlements
using the same demographic and socio-economic controls as in the ordinary least squares
(OLS) specifications. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

where the dependent variable is the vote share of the two main right-wing parties, Ait
is an indicator separating time periods before the refugee crisis (A = 0) from the period
after the crisis (A = 1), and Tit is the separation of settlements according to exposure to
refugees as defined above.
The key variable of interest is the interaction term between Ait and Tit , which estimates the true treatment effect. Zi refers to the socio-economic control variables, while
ωi is the matching estimator. When using kernel matching, each treated observation i
is matched with several control observations, with weights inversely proportional to the
distance in propensity scores between treated and control observations. The propensity
scores are estimated using a logit regression using the same controls.
Finally we check for heterogeneity in the impact of treatment on individual policy
preferences and attitudes using survey data. Since the answers are heavily skewed towards
anti-refugee attitudes, we use logistic regression models in which the dependent variables
take the value of 1 if the respondent chooses the response most critical towards refugees.
We control for several individual-level attributes that have been shown to relate to antiimmigrant attitudes (Fitzgerald and Lawrence 2011), namely whether individual has a
high school degree, if they report that they are in a precarious economic situation, their
self-reported gender, and if their settlement is within 25 km of a border (collected in
the matrix Wij ). We include regional (NUTS 2) fixed-effects rather than county (NUTS
3) fixed-effects because we do not have survey participants from all 20 counties, and in
several counties we only have untreated or treated observations. To test our hypothesis
that treatment affects right-wing voters more than left-wing or non-partisan citizens,
13

we introduce an interaction between treatment and whether the individual indicates a
political preference for either Jobbik or Fidesz (Rj ):
P (Yij = 1) = α + δ1 Ti + δ2 (Ti ∗ Rj ) + β3 Rj + β4 Wij + ij .

Results
Treatment and Referendum Voting Behavior

Table 1 presents our OLS models estimating results of the 2016 referendum on immigration at the settlement-level. As discussed in the previous section, our dependent variable
is the number of ’no’ votes in the referendum as share of the total eligible voters. We
first estimate the model controlling only for previous election results, population, and the
socio-economic controls. In this first estimation, we find that treatment leads to a 3.6
percent higher share of no votes in a settlement. In a second step (Model 2) we introduce
county-fixed effects and proximity to the border to control for the different geographic
effects across the country. Here we observe a reduced though still significant effect of 1.7
percent. These findings support our first hypothesis, namely that short term exposure to
refugees during the crisis leads to anti-refugee voting. Our estimates are similar to the
2 percent effect found by Dinas et al. (forthcoming) in their study of far-right voting on
Greek islands following the crisis.
Models 3 and 4 in Table 1 test the effect of distance from treatment. The models
suggest that treatment has an effect beyond the treatment settlement itself and this effect
decreases as travel time increases. Model 4 replicates this finding with binned distances.
We interpret these models as supporting our second hypothesis, that the effect of short
term exposure on anti-refugee voting behavior spills over to nearby locations.

Change in Party Vote Shares

Table 2 presents the results of our difference-in-differences estimations of the change
in Fidesz, Jobbik, and combined Fidesz and Jobbik (right-wing, for short) vote shares
between the 2014 and 2018 parliamentary elections. The results suggest that there was
no significant overall effect of treatment on votes of the right-wing as a whole. However,
we see a redistribution of votes within the camp: while Jobbik gained roughly two percent
in treated settlement, Fidesz lost two percent, compared to settlements through which
refugees did not travel. We also report a placebo test of the same models using data from
the 2010 and 2014 parliamentary elections to test the parallel trends assumption. We do
not observe the same redistribution of votes from Fidesz to Jobbik across the previous
elections.
These findings support our third hypothesis that Jobbik, as opposition party, would
gain votes in treated settlements from the ruling Fidesz. They question the interpretation
of previous results on short-term exposure and voting for the right as a consequence of

the right-wing’s issuer-ownership of immigration rather than holding the government
accountable. As a whole, the right-wing did not win more votes in exposed towns. In our
context, the redistribution of votes within Hungary suggests an anti-government vote as
Jobbik and Fidesz were competing with each other to take the more hardline anti-refugee
position.
More broadly, the flow of votes from Fidesz to Jobbik in treated settlements between
2014 and 2018 contrasts with the national results. Nationally Fidesz gained over four
percent, while Jobbik lost more than one percent. In other words, right-wing voters in
settlements exposed to the crisis punished the ruling party at the polls by voting for
an alternative anti-refugee party, while elsewhere Fidesz expanded its support. We keep
this question in mind as we contrast individual attitudes among left and right voters in
treated settlements.

5.3

Survey

Using data from a survey of the general population of Hungary in January 2016, between
the peak of the crisis and the referendum, we consider how specifically contact with
refugees in the crisis may have changed the political opinions and policy preferences
of Hungarians. We interact treatment with respondent’s party choice to see how this
effect differs between left and right citizens. While we have no information on previous
vote choices, citizens are asked about their current vote preference before the topic of
immigration is broached in the survey.
One serious limitation of our survey analysis is that partisanship is self-reported and
recorded after the crisis: it may be that exposure to refugees during the crisis moved
individuals to the right, in particular those individuals who were especially influenced by
their experiences. We test whether individuals in treated settlements were more likely to
report support for a right-wing party and found no significant relationship. We report
these results in the appendix (see Table 8). We also note that recent work on Hungary
suggests that partisanship is increasingly consistent and polarized over time (Angelusz
and Tardos 2011), rendering defection across the left and right camp less likely.
Table 3 shows the impact of treatment on a battery of six different attitudinal questions. Besides the first question, we group the variables into two groups: the first relates
to questions about laws or policies that should be enacted in response to the crisis (models 2, 3, and 4), and the second relates to how and why the respondent worries about the
potential impact of the refugees (models 5 and 6). Our translations of the questions are
available in the Appendix (Table 5).
Model 1 measures which respondents are more likely to reject accepting any refugees
at all, regardless of their origin. While we do not see a significant interaction effect, respondents who vote for Fidesz or Jobbik are more likely to reject all refugees. Model 2 to
4 analyze respondents’ support for different policies, namely the strengthening of border
protection (2), a law obliging refugees to accept Hungarian culture (3) and additional
money for integration (4). For consistency, we coded the dependent variable in Model 4

as rejection rather than support of additional money for the integration of refugees. We
observe a significant and positive interaction effect for border security and the refusal to
allocate more money to refugee integration. Model 5 and 6 analyze to which extent respondents are worried about the arrival of undocumented immigrants (5) and immigrants
who belong to a different culture (6). Uniquely, Model 5 shows that respondents who
live in treated settlements are more worried about the high number of undocumented
immigrants coming to Hungary regardless of party, though the effect is stronger among
right-wing voters. In contrast only right-wing voters express worry that arriving refugees
come from different cultures. Arguably, left-wing voters and non-partisans also worry
about changes in their settlement but draw different conclusions from this.

Figure 4: Conditional effects of interactions between partisanship and anti-refugee attitudes. In several models, there is a significant interaction effect between right-wing
preferences and living in a settlement exposed to the refugee crisis when predicting antirefugee policy preferences and worrying about refugees.
To ease interpretation, we plot the conditional effects of our interaction terms in
Figure 4. Notably, in many of the models, the difference between treated and nontreated right-wing respondents is larger than the relatively small differences between leftand right-wing respondents in untreated settlements. We observe almost no change in
model 1 and 3 which measure whether individuals reject accepting any refugees and
whether they support a law that protects Hungarian culture.
Although not all interaction effects are statistically significant, we believe these results
provide evidence that it was mostly right-wing citizens who hardened their position on
19

immigration when exposed to refugees for a short period. Together with our differencein-differences analysis, this suggests right-wing parties mostly competed with each other
to present tougher immigration policies.

Conclusion

In this paper we related exposure to refugees during the 2015 crisis to political outcomes
in Hungary. We find that contact predicts anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on
refugee quotas in 2016. Exposed settlements voted more for the far-right Jobbik party in
the 2018 parliamentary elections, while the ruling Fidesz party, also right-wing and antirefugee, lost votes. Finally, survey evidence suggests that exposure seems to galvanize
anti-refugee attitudes only for right-wing partisans.
In contrast with previous work relating contact with refugees to electoral outcomes,
our first dependent variable directly captures voting behavior on immigration issues.
Hungary itself is also an interesting case as simultaneously one of the most xenophobic
and least diverse countries in Europe. As Hungary has two significant right-wing antirefugee parties, we can compare the effects of contact on the support for the anti-refugee
right in government and in opposition in the same context.
Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion of how contact theory applies to
the European refugee crisis. A growing body of research suggests that the length and
conditions of contact are decisive mediators in the formation of public opinion about
refugees. We also note an interesting heterogeneity at the individual level based on
partisanship. While Homola and Tavits (2017) suggest that left-wing voters become
more tolerant with long-run exposure, we find that right-wing voters are significantly less
tolerant after short term encounters.
These findings suggest some important policy implications. While most work on
improving refugee integration outcomes focuses on the long-term (Bansak et al. 2018) and
through targeted interventions (Lazarev and Sharma 2017), the finding that transient
short term contact inflames anti-immigrant attitudes indicates the value of improving
crisis management policy (Esses, Hamilton, and Gaucher 2017).

Table 7: Logistic regression models predicting whether survey respondent has encountered
refugee in previous 12 months (January 2016 Survey). Individuals living settlements
exposed to the 2015 refugee crisis are significantly more likely to report encountering
a refugee, even when controlling for knowing a foreigner personally or living close to a
border.
