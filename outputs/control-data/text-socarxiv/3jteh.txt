1. Executive Summary
The year 2016 marked a turning point in the history of the relations between the Internet, social
media, public opinion, and politics. Online practices of grassroots participation, which used to be
considered the prerogative of democratizing forces fighting established powers (Jenkins, 2006;
Shirky, 2008), turned out to be an effective platform to support conservative extremism as well
(Marwick & Lewis, 2017). In the attempt to make sense of what happened and develop workable
solutions, shocked actors and observers rapidly moved through the different stages of grief,
ranging from denial to anger and acceptance.
Initially, most of the attention and effort was devoted to detecting false content circulating on
the Internet. Unfortunately, stopping “fake news” proved harder than expected. The lack of clear
boundaries around the definition of both “fake” and “news” (Caplan, Hanson, & Donovan, 2018;
HLEG EU Commission, 2018) brought many authors to suggest alternative typologies and
terminologies (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017), with the aim of narrowing down the phenomenon –
e.g. the idea of fake news as commercially motivated (Silverman, 2017) – or, instead, expanding
the horizon by looking at relations between similar phenomena such as propaganda, satire and
even advertisement – e.g. the idea of problematic information (Jack, 2017; Wardle &
Derakhshan, 2017).
More recently the focus seems to have shifted from content to actors. Both false and real
content benefit from a multitude of actors that amplify (whether intentionally or not) its reach
(Giglietto, Iannelli, Valeriani, & Rossi, 2019). Depending on the popularity of each actor in the
network and the budget it can invest in social media ads, the magnitude of this amplification may

change drastically. Furthermore, popular content tends to spread faster on social media due to the
effect of algorithms that prioritize better-performing images, videos, and posts. These
performances depend on an estimate of popularity based on the analysis of quantified attention
metrics provided by each platform (likes, reactions, retweets, views, shares, etc). Beside the
effect of this “rich will get richer” feedback loop, popular social media content and highly
discussed topics are often featured in traditional media, thus benefiting from a significant further
spin. The centrality of these metrics offers big rewards to those interested in increasing the
visibility of certain content.
For these reasons, different actors may attempt to coordinate their efforts to get the initial plug
which, once detected by the algorithm, may ignite the propagation machine and even attract the
attention of mainstream media (Phillips, 2018). This is not at all a new phenomenon. Fans’
attempts to coordinate their behavior to push certain hashtags into Twitter trending topics date
back to 2011 at least (Boyd, 2017). During the last few years, we observed similar practices
applied with the aim of enhancing the spread of political news stories.
This report tries to shed some light on these practices in the context of Italian politics. Using
two datasets of political news stories collected in the six months preceding the 2018 Italian
general election (Giglietto, 2018; Giglietto et. al., 2018) and the 2019 European elections in
Italy, we analyzed the social media shares of these links on both Facebook and Instagram. By
looking at the news stories shared by multiple Facebook and Instagram accounts, pages and
public groups, we identified several networks (10 for 2018 and 50 for 2019) that repeatedly acted
in coordination to share the same links within a very short period of time. Both in 2018 and
2019, news stories shared by these networks of coordinated actors received a higher volume of

Facebook engagement when compared with other stories, boosted anti-immigration, far-right
propaganda and items often published by news outlets featured in the black lists of Italian
fact-checkers.
The following chapters describe the behavior of these networks and the political content they
promoted. Beside findings related to the Italian context, the report provides a method for the
identification of coordinated networks that can be easily applied to other national contexts.
The report introduces the reader to the role played by coordination and authenticity in the
realm of misinformation and is structured in three parts: networks, news sources, and content.
The first part describes the networks of pages, groups and public profiles that actively cooperated
to spread political news stories in the months preceding the 2018 and 2019 Italian elections. The
second part focuses on the sources of these news stories and their political leaning. The last part
delves into the content of the news articles shared by the coordinated networks.

2. Crazy ideas, “fake news”, coordination and authenticity on the
Internet
2.1 A pretty crazy idea
On Friday, November 11, four days after the 2016 vote for the US Presidential election, Mark
Zuckerberg was interviewed on stage during the “Techonomy” conference by the author of “The
Facebook Effect” (Kirkpatrick, 2012). Inevitably, given what the interviewer described as a
“bizarre moment in history with an election having just happened”, the opening question was
“how do you respond to the fact that Donald Trump has just been elected?”. This broad initial
question was then followed by increasingly specific inquiries on the influence of Facebook on
the US 2016 election. Pressed by the friendly but targeted questions, Facebook founder and CEO
said “Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of
content, influenced the election anyway... I think it is a pretty crazy idea”, and responding to a
question on the “filter bubble idea” (Bruns, 2019), replied that “all the research that we have
suggests that this isn’t really a problem” (Zuckerberg, 2016a).
Besides the obvious self-defensive nature of these public statements, both the tone and the
content of the interview well describes the stage of denial that initially characterized the
Facebook response to inquiries on their impact on the 2016 US Presidential election.
A few days later, a post on Zuckerberg Facebook page – eloquently starting with the sentence
“A lot of you have asked what we’re doing about misinformation, so I wanted to give an
update”, broadly describing the efforts undertaken to fight misinformation on the platform –
signaled a first departure from the initial denial stage (Zuckerberg, 2016b). Another status update

published by the Facebook founder and CEO on his personal Facebook page well describes this
shift. He wrote: “After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on
Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was
dismissive and I regret it. This is too important an issue to be dismissive. But the data we have
has always shown that our broader impact – from giving people a voice to enabling candidates to
communicate directly to helping millions of people vote – played a far bigger role in this
election” (Zuckerberg, 2017). In the space of a few months, Facebook radically altered the public
response on the issue of the platform's impact on elections and started to openly advertise the
efforts to fight attempts to subvert elections. While this post clearly marks a new stage in public
response to the issue, the efforts to fight misinformation on the platform were intensified
immediately after the election.
“Facebook Newsroom” blog and more specifically its “Integrity and Security” section testify
the various stages, strategies and definitions employed. The term “fake news”, used by both the
interviewer and Zuckerberg during the November 2016 interview, appears only in the first post
of the post-electoral series (Mosseri, 2016), to be quickly replaced by the terms “false news” and
“misinformation”. The focus is on improving the process of reporting by users, of evaluating
these reports by external “third party fact-checkers”, and on the idea of flagging false news as an
alternative to removing the content from the platform. In the first stage, content flagged as false
by teams of third-party fact-checkers were not deleted but signaled to users with a red label.
More recently, the spread of this content is demoted by the news-feed algorithm which takes into
account the responses of third-party fact-checkers as an additional factor affecting content
distribution.

The publication of the white paper “Information Operations and Facebooks” marks the
entrance to a new phase (Weedon, Nuland, & Stamos, 2017). Although specifically focused on
“Actions taken by governments or organized non-state actors to distort domestic or foreign
political sentiment”, the report opens with a critique of the term “fake news” and attempts to
detail and extend the terminology used to describe these operations by introducing the term
“False Amplifiers”. “False Amplifiers” are defined as “Coordinated activity by inauthentic
accounts with the intent of manipulating political discussion” (2017, p. 5). In this report, for the
first time, Facebook widened the focus from content to actors and introduced the key concepts of
“coordinated activity” and “inauthentic accounts”.
Starting mid-2018, Facebook began to publicize more widely and systematically the
actor-centered approach undertaken to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform.
Whenever a group of pages, groups, and profiles are removed from the platform, a press release
that briefly explains the rationale behind the choice is issued via the “Facebook Newsroom –
Integrity and Security” blog. In the vast majority of cases, the action is undertaken in response to
a violation of the platform policy or community standards. Frequently this violation is described
as “Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior”.
“Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior” on Facebook and Instagram have been defined in a brief
two-minutes explanatory video by Nathaniel Gleicher, Head of Cybersecurity Policy of
Facebook as a case when “groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who
they are or what they are doing” (Gleicher, 2018). By shifting the attention to deceptive
behaviors, the definition deliberately avoids to fall in the trap of judging the truthfulness of
content: “The posts themselves may not be false”. In the same video, Gleicher also provides an

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

example: “We may take a network down for making it look like it’s being run from one part of
the world when in fact it’s being run from another. This could be done for ideological purposes
or can be financially motivated.”
The issue of coordination is further explained by press releases describing concrete
operations, such as the recent one concerning organized campaigns in UAE, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia (Gleicher, 2019): “The people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used
fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.” “The people
behind this network used compromised and fake accounts (...) to run Pages, disseminate their
content, comment in Groups and artificially increase engagement. They also impersonated public
figures and managed Pages – some of which changed names and admins – posing as local news
organizations in targeted countries and promoting content about UAE”.
In other terms, the definition comprises of coordination and inauthenticity. Both topics have
been widely studied, although rarely in conjunction. In the next paragraphs, we summarize these
studies with the aim of grounding the definition of coordinated inauthentic behavior in the
existing literature.

2.2 Inauthentic Behavior
In a famous cartoon designed by Peter Steiner and published by The New Yorker on July 5,
1993, a dog sitting in front of a computer says to another: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re
a dog”. It reminds us that the problem of authenticity on the Internet is as old as the Internet
itself, or it would be better to say, as the human ability to lie. Indeed, many online deceptive
tactics can be conceived as types of propaganda consolidated throughout the history of media

and politics. In the last few years, it has become increasingly evident that websites and social
media can create opportunities for actors to propagate ideas covering their real identities and
intentions. Donovan and Friedberg coined the term “source hacking” to describe a set of
techniques for hiding the source of problematic information (Donovan & Friedberg, 2019). For
example, McTavish (2006) reported that “entering the term ‘pro-choice’ in an Internet search
engine reveals a range of sites, including one called ‘ProChoice.com’, which is actually an
anti-choice site providing false information about abortion”. Anti-abortion websites concealed by
pro-choice websites have also been found by Daniels (2014), who identified white supremacist
sites disguising cyber-racism (2009), while Farkas, Schou, and Neumayer (2017), found Danish
Facebook pages that imitate radical Islamist pages to spark racist reactions against Muslims and
immigrants.
Daniels (2009, 2014) has defined “cloaked websites” the sites “published by individuals or
groups who conceal authorship in order to disguise deliberately a hidden political agenda”. He
argues that this type of website is “similar to previous versions of print and electronic media
propaganda in which the authorship, source or intention of a publication or broadcast is
obscured” (Daniels, 2009). He has referred, in particular, to the concept of “white”, “grey” and
“black” propaganda that Soley and Nichols (1986) employed to classify revolutionary and
counter-revolutionary radio communication. “White propaganda” radio stations are those that
spread messages identifying authorship, affiliation, and the intended political purpose. “Grey
propaganda” points at the radio stations “operated purportedly by dissident groups within a
country, although actually they might be located in another nation”. Finally, “black propaganda”
radio stations “transmit broadcasts by one side disguised as broadcasts by another”.

The stronger difference, needless to say, is that between “black” and “white” propaganda.
Becker (1949) defined the first as a “variety which is presented by the propagandizer as coming
from a source inside the propagandized”, and the latter “that variety which is definitely
announced by the propagandizer as coming from a source outside the propagandized”. Gray
propaganda can be defined, instead, using a veracity criterion, as a combination of accurate and
inaccurate content and sourcing information (Jack, 2017). Becker dismissed the concept exactly
for this reason: “the term usually rests on the erroneous introduction of the veracity criterion; as
previously stated, a workable definition does not include the question of how much of the
propaganda is true or how much is false”. A less restrictive definition of black propaganda can
be found, for example, in Doob (1950), who, with reference to Goebbels’ principles of
propaganda, defined the black type as composed of “material whose source is concealed from the
audience. Goebbels disguised his identity when he was convinced that the association of a white
medium with himself or his machine would damage its credibility”.
Daniles (2009) underlined the concept of hidden political agenda as a key element to define
cloaked websites, in this way drawing a distinction between this kind of sites and the more
general category of “counterfeit”, “hoax” and “urban legend” websites. It is, however, worth to
note that a certain degree of ambivalence, including when it comes to online actor’s real agenda,
is constitutive to the Internet itself (Phillips and Milner, 2018).
Regarding the effectiveness of this kind of covert propaganda, it is worth notice what Becker
(1949) observed: “Mass dissemination of rumors and the like is furthered, naturally enough,
when there is widespread distrust of ordinary news sources”. As reported by the Reuters

11

Institute, trust in the news is particularly low in Italy, which ranks 21st among the 38 countries
taken into account (Newman et al., 2019).
Besides cloaked websites, the behavior of bots – agents that, with a varying degree of
automatization, communicate on social media – and fake accounts represent a well-known type
of inauthentic behavior. Both are a key tool for spreading computational propaganda, which is
“the assemblage of social media platforms, autonomous agents, and big data tasked with the
manipulation of public opinion” (Woolley, Howard, 2016). Paid users are employed by regimes
to impersonate fake social media accounts to undermine online public discourse and distract the
public from controversial issues (King, Pan & Roberts, 2017). Additionally, bots are widely
exploited to manipulate online political discussion and boost politicians’ followers to generate
false impressions of popularity (Bastos, Mercea, 2019; Bessi, Ferrara, 2016; Howard, Kollanyi,
2016; Ratkiewicz et al., 2011; Serrano et al., 2019; Woolley, 2016).
In their seminal work “The people’s choice”, (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, & Gaudet, 1944)
((Lazarsfeld et al., 1944)) wondered about the potential role played by personal influence
(exposure to casual conversations about politics as opposed to the role played by mass media) on
the formation of political opinions. According to the authors, in comparison with formal media,
personal influence is more pervasive, it reaches more frequently undecided voters and tends to
catch the audience less prepared against influence. Much of the causal exposure to political and
para-political content on social media happens in a context similar to personal influence which
may leave us unguarded. For this reason, social media accounts, pages, and groups (from now on
referred to as “entities”) that aim at influencing political opinion, may have a strong incentive to
do so without revealing their authentic goals. Furthermore, it is much easier to build a large

12

follower base by presenting the entity as if it were dedicated to entertaining and popular culture
than politics. Once the follower base is established, the pages and groups can be used to convey
political content to a largely unguarded audience.

2.3 Coordinated Behavior
Coordination can be defined as the act of making people and/or things involved in an activity
work together in an organized way. Several authors argued that it is a distinctive mark of users'
participation within online spaces (Bruns, Highfield & Burgess, 2013; Jenkins, 2006; Rotman et
al., 2011; Shirky, 2014). Such coordination plays a key role in the online participatory culture
described by Henry Jenkins in “Convergence Culture” (2006). In fact, fans were able to organize
collective actions with different purposes, for instance, to inflate social media attention metrics
(likes, retweets, etc) on a specific topic or to influence the plot of a narrative or the trade of an
item. Widely popular examples include the collective action of fans of the TV program
“Survival” to find the location where each season was filmed (Jenkins, 2006), or the “Beliebers”,
devoted fandom of Justine Bieber, and so on.
Online activism benefited from the opportunity of building communities going beyond the
need to meet in person and coordinating their collective actions allowed by the Internet. In fact,
in a first phase, several experiences of “hacktivism” (Goode, 2015; Hampson, 2012) were listed
as positive: also a controversial and multifaceted imageboard as 4Chan is praised for its
popularity and capacity to give birth to popular and effective movements like Anonymous
(Stryker, 2011). Several collective actions of Anonymous became widely popular, such as those
supportive of the Arab Spring, or the DDoS campaigns aimed at shaming financial organizations

13

(Coleman, 2014). Focusing on the online protests, there are examples of organizations that
recruit armies of web-activists to engage in coordinated online actions – such as mail bombing,
signing and spreading of online petitions and so on – in response to messages from the central
organization (De Matteis, Bertuzzi, 2019).
Beside the positive implications of the Internet on the activism, some online communities
started to exploit the new communication opportunities with very different purposes from social
justice and politically salient actions (Coleman, 2014; Jenkins, Ito, boyd, 2015). Such
coordinated behaviors started to take forms aimed at manipulating the communication space to
harass designated victims (Marwick, Lewis, 2017). For example, “Internet trolls” can work
together in organized brigades aimed at harming marginalized groups. Such social phenomena
are widely spread online, and one noticeable case was the “Gamergate”, an online movement that
used participatory culture strategies and tactics to target feminist media critics and game
developers (Marwick, Lewis, 2017).
Social network sites have probably become the most important tools for social movements to
organize both online and offline collective actions (Earl et al., 2010; Harlow, Harp, 2012).
Rotman and colleagues (2011), for instance, argued that “social activism campaigns flourished
via various social media” (p. 820), highlighting the role of social media in facilitating such
collective actions. For example, social media has played a role in organizing disinformation
campaigns (Keller et al. 2019), massive offline protest (Pérez, 2008), and contemporary popular
social and political movements have been effectively organized through social media such as the
“Yellow Vests” in France and the activists of “Friday for Future” in several countries.

14

Besides activism, it is evident that also every type of political propaganda requires a certain
degree of coordination to reach its goals. In the online environment, computational tools, along
with coordinated networks of social media activists, can facilitate the pursuit of communication
goals. Sometimes it is hard to draw a neat distinction between human-based and
automated-based information campaigns (Giglietto et al, 2019a), and the two forms may well
work together many times.

3. Organized networks of pages, public groups, and verified profiles
Through the analysis of the data collected through CrowdTangle, we detected a number of
coordinated networks that shared, on Facebook and Instagram, political news stories both during
the 2018 and 2019 Italian electoral campaigns. In order to do so, we implemented an algorithm
that, given a list of Facebook public shares of a set of URLs (links), estimate a time threshold in
seconds that identifies potential coordinated link sharing. In its essence, the algorithm looks at
unlikely (as compared to the entire set) quick shares of the same link by different entities.
Entities that performed this coordinated link sharing repeatedly on different URLs become part
of a network. We adopted a conservative approach both concerning the estimate of the time
threshold and the number of coordinated shares to be performed by an entity to become part of a
network. For these reasons the networks presented here should be considered as the core of
potentially larger networks (see Appendix 1 for methodological details).

3.1 2018 Italian general election
Considering the most coordinated entities, 28 Facebook pages and groups shared news in a
highly synchronized way before the election day of March 2018 (see Appendix 2, Tabs. 14 and
16). By grouping these entities in networks that shared the same news items we ended up with 10
diverse networks, three of which are merely editorial networks (1, 4 and 6). Apart from them,
networks with a high number of average subscribers (i.e. follower for pages and profiles, and
members for groups) stand out. It is the case of the network 2 (3,718,662.31 average
subscribers), 7 (1,611,914.98 average subscribers) and 8 (922,618.44 average subscribers).

16

The networks 2 and 8 (Fig. 1) are composed of official political pages of the League: the first
comprises the pages “Matteo Salvini” and “Lega - Caprino Bergamasco”, while the second
includes “Lega - Salvini Premier”, “Matteo Salvini Leader” and “Il Populista”1 and one public
group, “Noi con Salvini”.
Fig. 1. Networks 2 and 8 - 2018

Conversely, the network 7 (Fig. 2) is composed of five Facebook pages and groups apparently
not related to politics, “Aforismi e Link”, “link CATTIVI”, “Che il degrado sia con voi”,
“Professione”, “Affare Fatto”. Except for “Affare Fatto”, which shares content explicitly related
to politics, the other pages appear to be registered as entertainment websites.

Il Populista is a hyperpartisan source of information officially close to the right-wing League party.

17

Fig. 2. Network 7 - 2018

The network 5 (Fig. 3) includes two pages, namely “Tutte le cazzate del presidente”, and “Tutti
pazzi per Luciana”. While the first is aimed at reporting corruption and injustice in contemporary
politics, the latter is a fan page of the popular Italian comedian Luciana Littizzetto which
alternates her quotes and political or parapolitical news.
Fig. 3. Network 5 - 2018

The network 3 (Fig. 4) counts two pages apparently not related to politics: “FilmLinko” and
“Illusione ottica di movimento”. They both share news published by “nextQuotidiano.it”, an
online news source close to Italian left-wing.

18

Fig. 4. Network 3 - 2018

Finally, network 9 is composed of Facebook pages and groups close to far-right parties and
movements. In the period preceding the 2018 general election it counted three entities (Fig. 5),
namely “Italia Patria Mia” (no longer available), “NERO Dentro” and “Italia Uguale Dittatura”,
but the network considerably expanded in the run-up of 2019 European elections (see paragraph
4.1).
Fig. 5. Network 9 - 2018

3.2 2019 Italian election for the European Parliament
In the run up of 2019 European Parliament election the number of networks that shared news
coordinately is considerably increased: 50 (vs. 10 during the 2018 Italian general election)
composed of 143 different Facebook pages and groups (see Appendix 2, Tabs. 15 and 17).
Similar to 2018, some groups are simply editorial networks of clearly identified local pages
(1, 5, 11, 17, 29 and 39). The networks with an average subscribers count of more than a million

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

19

are the number 3, 4, 9 and 29 (FanPage editorial network). Among these four networks, the first
(number 3) is formed by Five Star Movement institutional pages, namely “M5S MoVimento 5
Stelle” and “MoVimento 5 Stelle Camera”, while the second (number 4) includes the League
institutional pages “Matteo Salvini” and “Salvini Premier”.
The network number 9 (4,009,045 of average subscribers) in figure 6 includes nine pages and
groups that are apparently non political: “Situazioni Virali”, “L’amore Proibito”, “Esperimenti
Sociali”, “Lu Mejo”, “Silenzio a ore”, “Ammazzate Dalle Risate con Lu Mejo”, “Tuasta”, “Link
Today”, “•»» Dolce & Bastarda ««•”. These entities alternate yellow press, tabloids information,
and political news stories. Usually they share popular tabloid news sources such as “Bigodino.it”
and “Cronaca Social”.
Fig. 6. Network 9 - 2019

20

The network 6 was present also in 2018 (network 3 see Fig 4). Judging from the stability of the
network in 2019 and 2018 in terms of entities involved and average subscribers count, the
network appears essentially unchanged.
The network 14 is peculiar. It is essentially an evolution of network 9 of 2018 (see Fig. 5).
This group of entities tend to share highly partisan extreme right content. Compared to 2018 the
network growth in terms of entities involved. Beside explicitly political pages/groups, in 2019 it
includes pages apparently dedicated to entertainment and fun such as “Dislessia Portami Via”
and “Screenshots divertenti”, and news media outlets such as “Corriere della notizia”. “Dislessia
Portami Via” and “Screenshots Divertenti” have an openly satirical nickname and display fun
memes on their profiles and cover images. Conversely they publish almost hyper-partisan posts,
including racist and pro Matteo Salvini messages.

Network 15 is the evolution of network 5 of 2018 (see Fig. 3) and remained substantially
unchanged, except for an additional component, i.e. “I fan di MARCO TRAVAGLIO”, a fan
page of a popular Italian journalist often considered close to the Five Stars Movement. Network
20 is peculiar because it includes a popular Facebook page, “La Tecnica della Scuola”, and a
public group, “ProfessioneInsegnante.it”, both related to Italian school issues and teaching
career. Both the components alternate the share of news and opinions about issues related to
teaching careers and politics-related posts.
Network 25 is the largest in terms of components number. It is composed of 18 unofficial
Facebook pages/groups close to the Five Star Movement with an overall level of average
subscribers.
Fig. 8. Network 25 - 2019

There are three more networks that are over 500k average subscribers:

22

-

the 35th is composed of two news sources close to the Five Star Movement, namely
“Diario del Web” and “diario 5 stelle”;

-

The 44th is formed by two official Facebook channels of the leader of the League Matteo
Salvini: “Lega Salvini Premier” and “Matteo Salvini Premier”;

-

Lastly, network 44 is composed of two counter-information and anti-establishment
components adjudicated

to the

League, called

“sapere è

un dovere” and

“controinformazione”.

Although assessing the impact of these networks on the public opinion falls outside the scope of
this report, a preliminary analysis showed, quite interestingly, that the political news stories
shared by one or more Facebook/Instagram coordinated networks before the 2018 and 2019
election received an engagement significantly greater than other news stories (Fig. 9). Further
analyses are required to ascertain the overall impact of coordinated link-sharing behavior.

4. Shared News Sources
According to our estimate2, in 2018 almost the whole of the news was shared by coordinated
networks close to the League (4,924 out of 5,662, or 87%). In 2019 the scenario was more
nuanced. Nonetheless, the entities closer to the League generated about 39% of all the URLs
shared by the highly coordinated networks, ranking second only to the cross-partisan entities and
clearly standing out from the Five Star Movement (6.4% of the URLs) and the Democratic Party
(1.3%) (Tab. 1).

Some of the domains shared by the entities in 2018 do not exist anymore. It is the case of
domains such as “italiapatriamia.eu”, already flagged by the debunking website Butac (2019),
“lafinestrasulcortile.altervista.org”, suspended because in violation of the hosting service
community rules, “informazioneitalia.com”, signaled by debunkers and likely associated with the
Facebook page “Mafia Capitale” (Puente, 2017b), “notizie24h.net”, “leggiora.info” and
“siciliainformazioni.com”. Among the deleted domains, those with the greater number of news
shared by the highly coordinately entities are “italiapatriamia.eu” (53 news stories) and
“leggiora.info” (48 news stories). Both the domains were among the most shared by the

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

25

Facebook page “Italia Patria Mia”, whose name clearly resembles that of the first news source.
The page, still existent in a first moment and with 383.899 likes, resulted shortly after not
available anymore. Another domain shared by the page is the already mentioned
“informazioneitalia.com”. The source is no longer online, although the Facebook page possibly
associated (the website is linked in the info section ​as of August 2019​) is still online. The page
now shares news published by the website “kontrokultura.it”, whose director manage a network
of online media that has been associated with the spread of fake news (see AGI, 2016; Mingani,
2017; Rijtano, Barcellona, 2016). Also the administrator of the page “Italia Patria Mia” has
already been signaled by debunkers and associated with the domain “italiapatriamia.eu” and
other websites and Facebook pages (see Democratica, 2018; Puente, 2015, 2017a; Mastinu,
2016). This page is part of a coordinated network that comprise also “Italia uguale Dittatura” and
“NERO Dentro”. The most engaging stories shared by the network are against the former prime
minister and Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi (Fig. 10).
Compared with 2018, in 2019 among the most prolific domains there were more sources close
to the Five Star Movement, such as the mainstream online newspaper “ilfattoquotidiano.it” and
“ilblogdellestelle.it”, the official websites of the party (Tab. 3).
Some of the 2019 domains are not accessible anymore at the time of writing. It is the case, for
example, of “cronacapiu.it” and “attivonews.com”, signaled by debunking websites (Bufale.net,
2019; Butac, 2019), “giornale24italia.altervista.org”, suspended because in violation of the rules
of

and

Overall, 10 domains whose news was shared in a highly coordinated way before the 2018
Italian general election, and 16 domains of those shared before the 2019 European elections,

attacks him, he manages to save himself by a miracle” (engagement: 10019). The headline on the top says:

4.1 Networks that change, networks that stay the same
15 out of 28 (54%) highly coordinated entities active in 2018 were active in 2019 too (Tab. 5).
Comparing 2019 to 2018, it can be observed that new networks emerged, some networks
remained stable and some other changed. As already briefly mentioned, the far-right network
that includes “Italia Patria Mia” (not anymore available at the time of writing) expanded from 3
to 10 entities.
Fig. 11. The far-right network comparison in 2018 and 2019

In 2019 the network also included “Screenshots divertenti”, “Dislessia Portami Via”,
“Riprendiamoci La Patria”, “Nessuno di loro”, “Corriere della notizia”, “Prima aiutiamo gli
Italiani poi si vede. - Movimento Adesso Italia” and “Adesso Italia”. All these pages – with the
exception of “Screenshots divertenti”, “Dislessia Portami Via” – have also been included in a list
of pages that spread hate and disinformation by the ONG Avaaz and the online newspaper TPI
(Di Benedetto Montaccini, 2019; Mastinu, 2019). Overall, the Avaaz and TPI list includes 22
Facebook pages that spread news on Facebook in a highly coordinated manner during the 2018
and 2019 Italian elections (Tab. 6)

4.2 The news sharing cascade
A preliminary exploratory analysis pointed out that each page within the network had a different
role in the news sharing cascade. For instance, considering the first of the 2018 most followed
networks (Tab. 7), it can be observed that the page “Matteo Salvini” tend to share the news first
(mean rank = 1.00), regularly followed by the page “Lega - Caprino Bergamasco” (mean rank =
1.91). The same is true for the 2019 most popular network (Tab. 8).

5. Content
5.1 Non-political and ambivalent entities with a hidden political agenda
In 2018, non-political pages and groups included in coordinated networks were 17 while the
political ones 11 (see Tab. 9). Before the 2019 election the number of coordinated pages and
groups was clearly higher: 49 were non-political and 94 political (see Tab. 10). In 2019 the
political pages and groups are almost the double of non political ones, while in 2018 the average
subscribers count of the pages and groups was higher.

Political set of pages and groups is quite homogeneous and composed of activists, official parties
and hyper partisan spaces. The non-political items are composed of Facebook pages of national
and local media outlets, such as “Roma Fanpage.it” or “DiariodelWeb.it”, satirical and

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

33

aphorisms pages apparently not related to politics, such as “Aforismi e Link” ( Aphorisms and
Links”) and “Screenshot Divertenti” (“Funny Screenshots”), and online spaces related to
education and teaching, such as “La Tecnica della Scuola” (“The School Technique”) or
“ProfessioneInsegnante.it” (“Teaching Career”).
The most interesting cases among non-political Facebook pages and groups are those
apparently related to satira and entertainment, such as “Situazioni Virali” (“Viral Situations”)
and “L’Amore Proibito” (“The Impossible Love”), which are included in network 9. They are
two related pages sharing different news, political, soft and yellow news (see Fig. 12).
Fig 12. Two examples of posts shared by “Situazioni virali”, the one on the left side is a tabloid news talking about
the look of a young George Clooney, while the other one is a clearly political post by the title “Matteo Salvini
commented the meeting between Conte and Macron. This is what the ex Vice Prime Minister said.”

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

34

In the run up of the elections, both these pages shared this widely popular political news:
“Matteo Salvini alla scrittrice Michela Murgia: ‘Radical chic’. E lei ha risposto così” (“Matteo
Salvini called the writer Michela Murgia a ‘Radical chic’ and she answered like that”), published
by “Cronache Social” and concerning a long-lasting debate between the feminist writer Michela
Murgia and Matteo Salvini, who accused her of being a “Radical Chic”, an expression used as a
synonym of elitist.
Also network 14 (see Appendix 2, Tab. 15) , is composed of both openly far-right entities,
such as “NERO Dentro” (“Black Inside”) or “Italia uguale Dittatura” (“Italy means Tyranny”),
and completely misleading entertainment pages, such as “Dislessia Portami Via” (“Dyslexia take
me away”) and “Screenshots Divertenti” (Fig. 13) that actually use to share hyperpartisan
content. For example, Dislessia Portami via shared in a coordinated way a political news entitled:
“The Church is collapsing, but the Vatican launches a crusade against Salvini”, published by the
Antonio Socci’s blog “Lo Straniero” (Fig. 14). The article reaches 20,244 Facebook interactions
and attacks Pope Francis because his pro-migrants positions and his criticism against the Italian
anti-migrants politics.
Fig. 13. Cover and profile images of the Facebook page Screenshots Divertenti (network 14). In addition to the
laughing emoji, there is an ironic comic streep about Eve asking god to fix Adam obsession for football.

35

Fig. 14. An example of news shared by “Dislessia portami via”, it is news published by the blog “Lo Straniero”,
edited by the journalist and writer Antonio Socci.

A further ambivalent network (see Appendix 2, Tabs. 14 and 15), is composed of a political
page, “tutte le cazzate del presidente” (“all the president’s crap”) and two non political fan pages,
namely “Tutti pazzi per Luciana” (“All crazy for Luciana”), devoted to the famous comedian
Luciana Littizzetto and “i fan di MARCO TRAVAGLIO” (“Marco Travaglio’s fan”), dedicated
to the journalist Marco Travaglio. According to our estimate, this network is close to Five Star
Movement positions and coordinately shared political news. For instance, one was entitled:
“‘The list of ministers announced by Di Maio is comical, they are third-class professor’, said
Silvio Berlusconi, the one who proposed Carfagna, Gelmini, Alfano, Mastella, Calderoli, Previti,
Giovanardi and many others who are even worse!” (Fig. 15, Facebook engagement 21,041)

5.2 Migration and League dominates most engaging shared news-stories
Considering the news shared in a highly coordinated way during both the 2018 general election
and the 2019 European election, the centrality of the League and that of migration – a core issue
on the League’s political agenda – stand out. The top engaging stories during both the 2018 and
2019 elections are all favourable to the League narrative or against its political opponents, such
as that published by the League online news media “Il Populista” that is entitled: “Di Maio will
vote the Ius Soli, the Five Star Movement is more and more to the left” (ilpopulista.it,
engagement 20,970), and that published by Vanity Fair with the title: “Salvini said: “I would be a
vandal? Saviano should give up the escort and come among the common people” (vanityfair.it,
engagement 16,203).

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

37

Fig. 16. Some engaging news stories shared in a highly coordinated way before the 2018 Italian general election.
The first on the left is entitled: “Di Maio will vote the Ius Soli, the Five Star Movement is more and more to the
left”, the news on the up-right “Salvini said: “I would be a vandal? Saviano should give up the escort and come
among the common people”. The title of the news on the bottom-left is: “The illegal immigrants coming from
Libya? One out of four are sick with aids or hepatitis”. The last one is entitled: “Ius Soli, a Moroccan activist:
“Remove citizenship from Salvini”

The same pattern marks the most engaging 2019 news stories. For instance: “13 Romanian
prisoners returned home. Salvini: ‘This is only the beginning’” (ilgiornale.it, engagement:
249,833), “Failed cooperatives, Matteo Renzi's parents under house arrest” (corriere.it,
engagement: 170,638).
In 2019 there are also some exceptions. For example, the fourth most engaging news story
(huffingtonpost.it, engagement: 196,259), is entitled: “‘We are governed by a band of half
fascists and half of idiots’. The accusation of Gino Strada. The founder of Emergency: ‘Fortress
Europe is a Hitlerian idea’” (“‘Siamo governati da una banda per metà di fascisti e per metà di
coglioni’. L’accusa di Gino Strada. Il fondatore di Emergency: ‘La fortezza Europa è un’idea
hitleriana’”). Nonetheless, both in 2018 and 2019 immigration emerges as one of the most

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

38

relevant issues. Considering the 2018 most frequent terms, afterwards generally referred to the
political sphere, such as politicians’ and party’s names, the word “Ius Soli” represents the 24th
most frequent one, and “immigrato” (immigrant) ranks 29th. Taking into account the 62 news
outlets that have published the 1,388 news mentioning one of the top lemma “ius soli”,
“immigrato” (immigrant), “immigrazione” (immigration) or “clandestino” (illegal immigrant), it
emerges that the hyperpartisan outlets “ilpopulista.it”, and its subdomains “tv.ilpopulista.it”,
close to the League, is responsible for 64% of the total news on immigration shared by the
coordinated networks. In 2019, the topic is even more prominent, considering that “migrare”
(that is “to migrate”) ranks 11th among the most frequent lemma. The most engaging news that
mentions this lemma frames migration as a threat and spread the Salvini’s point of view (Fig.
17). For instance: “Terrorism, jihad informer triggers a blitz: 8 arrests. ‘You are risking suicide
attacks in Italy’”. (palermo.repubblica.it, engagement: 88,619), or “Matteo Salvini (...) ‘I don't
change my mind about migrants, ports remain closed’” (lettoquotidiano.it, engagement: 86,383),
or “The hatred of migrants against Salvini: ‘Assassin’” (ilgiornale.it, engagement: 82,634).
Further analysis confirmed the centrality of the League and Matteo Salvini in the news stories
shared by the highly coordinated networks. Indeed, taking into consideration the three topics
more likely to be shared by coordinated pages in 2018 (Tab. 11), we found that the first most
recurring topic is about the electoral rally of Matteo Salvini, the second most frequent one is
relative to the League’s transformation from a secessionist northern party to a national party
seeking for consent also in southern Italy (a change represented by the removal of the word
“Nord” from the party name and symbol), but that, at the same time, keep supporting traditional
issues of the “old” Northern League, such as the referendum for the autonomy of Lombardy and

Veneto regions. The third most recurrent topic is about the clash between Salvini and European
Union politics.
Fig. 17. A set of news stories supporting the ex-Vice Prime Minister Matteo Salvini

Taking into consideration the three most recurrent topics in 2019 (Tab. 12), the first one is about
the closure of Italian harbors to migrants decided by Matteo Salvini, the newly Interior Minister.
The second most recurring topic concerns migration and related security issues, and the topic
that ranks third in the classification is public investment in infrastructure and other activities such
as the strengthening of public security.
Overall, the analyses point out that a large quantity of content spread by the highly connected
entities, during both the 2018 and 2019 electoral campaign, boosted League-friendly propaganda.
This insight is further supported by the number of news that mentioned the main political
leaders: in 2018, 62% of news shared by the highly coordinated entities mentioned Salvini, while
only 6% Di Maio, 11% Berlusconi, and 17% Renzi. In 2019 the scenario is somehow more
nuanced, but Salvini was anyway mentioned by 48% of the news circulated within these

6. Limitations
The work presented in this manuscript makes use of CrowdTangle data gathered through the
official API. The authors gained access to the tool in the context of the Social Media and
Democracy Research Grants, managed by the Social Science Research Council in partnership
with Facebook and Social Science One, which has allowed selected scholars to access a dataset
of URLs shared on Facebook and the Facebook Ads Library API. Unlike the commercial version
of CrowdTangle, which also tracks Twitter and Reddit, the version currently provided to
researchers is limited to Facebook and Instagram data. CrowdTangle includes most but not all
the public interactions performed on Facebook and Instagram3. The analysis based on
CrowdTangle shares is thus limited to what is tracked by the tool.
Another limitation concerns the application of the Multi-Party Media Partisan Attention Score
(MP-MPAS, Giglietto et al., 2018) to Facebook entities. MP-MPAS was originally conceived to
estimate the political leaning of online news media sources by measuring the activity of partisan
communities around the news stories published by these outlets. Using the annotated lists of
news sources shared on Facebook in the six months before the 2018 general election and 2019
European election in Italy, we mapped the MP-MPAS scores to the Facebook entities that shared
the news stories published by these sources. However, some clearly partisan entities (e.g. the
official Facebook page of Matteo Salvini), tend to share links from a variety of news sources,
sometimes to amplify positive coverage and sometimes to criticize or mock stories against the

party and its leader. In cases like this, the method underestimates the partisanship and classifies
the pages and groups as cross-partisan.
Given the highly innovative repertory of data this work dealt with, some of the strategies
employed proved to be tricky. More specifically, many analyses focused on the understanding of
the pattern of sharing were required to set the threshold that defined coordinated link sharing in
order to allow us to identify the networks of coordinated entities. Although we linked the
threshold to the statistical distribution of Facebook shares, a number of arbitrary choices were
made to surface coordinated link sharing. For this reason, we were extremely conservative
regarding the definition of coordinated entities, i.e. the frequency of repeated coordinated shares
that define a network of coordinated entities. In this sense, the networks we identified represent
the core of potentially larger networks.

7. Discussion and Conclusion
Starting from an analysis of the official Facebook discourses on disinformation in the
aftermath of the 2016 US Presidential election, we traced the different stages of dealing with this
issue. While the initial focus was on false content and hoaxes, the most recent phase seems to be
more focused on the actions of certain actors on the platform. Coordinated inauthentic behavior
is only briefly defined by Facebook in official public statements, but the concept itself is useful
to frame future studies insofar as both the idea of coordination and authenticity are well
established in the literature.
Using CrowdTangle API link endpoint and two datasets of political news stories published in
the run up to the 2018 general election and 2019 European election in Italy, we identified several
networks of pages, groups and verified public profiles (referred to as “entities”) that shared,
within a very short period of time, the same links. We called this behavior “coordinated link
sharing”. By analysing the profile and cover photos of the entities, we observed that not all the
entities belonging to these networks presented themselves as clearly political in nature, despite
the fact that all of them shared political content at least sometimes. Political news stories
published by non political entities can reach a broad audience which is largely unguarded against
attempts to influence. We described these entities as “inauthentic”.
On average, the news shared by the coordinated networks registered a volume of Facebook
interactions significantly higher than those shared by non coordinated entities, both before the
2018 and 2019 elections. Overall, the exploratory analysis of the news stories shared by these
networks pointed out that a considerable quantity of content boosted League-friendly

45

propaganda. The finding was supported by the number of news stories that mentioned the main
political leaders and the estimated partisanship of the coordinated entities. A further analysis
revealed that several online news outlets and Facebook pages included in the coordinated
networks were already mentioned in black lists of Italian fact-checking websites.
The findings described in this report, although preliminary, shed light on specific strategies
used by social media actors to amplify certain news stories in an attempt to influence public
opinion. While in terms of the volume of interactions gathered by these stories the attempt seems
to have been successful, measuring the effect of these operations in influencing public opinion
falls outside the scope of this report.
From a methodological perspective, the report introduced a method to identify coordinated
link sharing based on a list of political news stories and the respective Facebook/Instagram
shares. This method can be easily replicated in other national contexts.

Appendix 1 - Measures and Methods
Dataset
The report is based on two datasets of online Italian political news stories shared on Facebook
during the six months before the 2018 Italian general election (N=84,815) and the 2019
European election (N=164,780). For both the election, the news items were collected in real-time
using a technological infrastructure based on open-source software Huginn4. The news stories
were collected from three sources: Google News, the Global Database of Society (GDELT) and
Twitter (filtering for tweets including a link and mention of a candidate or a political party)5.
CrowdTangle API link endpoint (CrowdTangle Team, 2019) was used to collect public
Facebook/Instagram shares of the news stories URLs in our datasets performed in a period of
seven days after the publication of each piece of news. CrowdTangle is a social media analytics
tool owned by Facebook that tracks public posts on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit, made by
public accounts or groups. The tool does not track every public account and does not track
private profiles or groups, so this data is not representative of performance across the entire
platform. The numbers shown by this tool reflect public interactions (likes, reactions, comments,
shares, upvotes and three second views), but do not include reach or referral traffic. It does not
include paid ads unless those ads began as organic, non-paid posts that were subsequently
“boosted” using Facebook’s advertising tools. Because the system doesn’t distinguish this type
of paid content, note that some high-performing content may have had paid distribution.

Huginn is “a system for building agents that perform automated tasks”: ​https://github.com/huginn/huginn​.
See (Giglietto et al., 2019a, 2019b) for a detailed description of the methodology used to collect political
news-stories.

CrowdTangle also does not track posts made visible only to specific groups of followers6. The
resulting datasets consist of 107,842 shares performed by 6,171 unique entities (2018 election)
and 222,877 shares performed by 8,107 unique entities (2019). Leveraging on MP-MPAS
(Giglietto et al., 2019b) each entity has been categorized according to the partisanship of the
news sources they shared. MP-MPAS (i.e. Multi-Party Media Partisanship Attention Score) is a
measure of partisan attention towards news media sources which builds on a rapidly growing
body of existing literature (Bakshy et al. 2015; Barberá 2015; Benkler et al. 2018) that
introduced and developed the idea of analyzing the patterns of link sharing of known partisan
users to infer the attention devoted by certain partisan community to different online news media
outlets. In this report, we leverage the same logic to infer the partisanship of entities that shared
news stories from known partisan news sources. In other terms, a Facebook page that only
shared news stories from news sources close to a certain party is, in turn, considered close to that
party.

Coordinated network detection
In order to identify the coordinated networks, we developed an algorithm that estimate, for each
dataset of CrowdTangle shares, a coordination threshold based on the analysis of the sharing
behavior of all the entities7. Even though it is common that several entities share the same URL,
these shares are unlikely to occur within a very short period of time. In order to operationalize

Please see ​https://help.crowdtangle.com/en/articles/1140930-what-is-crowdtangle-tracking for an overview of what
CrowdTangle is tracking. For this study only Facebook and Instagram platforms have been used.

The algorithm is developed in r and the code is available on request. If you are interested please write a

the concept of “very short time”, we analyzed the time differences between each share of the
same URL and ranked them based on the share date (i.e. the datetime when the links were
shared). We then calculated the time difference in seconds between the first (in chronological
order) and all the other shares of the same URL. We used the time difference between the first
and the second share to identify a subset consisting of the 10% of URLs with the shortest time
span between the first and the second shares. We then analyzed the behavior of this subset and
identified the desired threshold by calculating the median time in seconds used by 10% of the
quickest URLs to reach 50% of their total number of shares. This threshold is, respectively, 10
seconds for 2018 and 23 seconds for 2019.
We used this threshold to identify a set of entities that quickly shared each URL. From this
list we derived the networks of entities that frequently (above the 90th percentile or more than 8
times for 2018 and more than 6.4 times for 2019) shared links in a coordinated way. Given the
conservative approach used in estimating both the time and repetition threshold, the networks
listed in this report should be considered as the core of potentially larger networks.
All the networks and entities detected are listed in Tab 14 and 15 of this appendix. For a more
easily reusable format, the same tables, enriched by additional metadata, are aso available at
https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KYRK0X.

Engagement
To compare the engagement distribution of the URLs shared by entities included and not
included in the coordinated networks, we used a Mann-Whitey U one-tailed test (also known as
Wilcoxon rank sum test), a non-parametric test for determining statistical differences between

Patterns of Facebook Interactions around Insular and Cross-Partisan Media Sources in the Run-up to the 2018 Italian Election | LaRiCA at UNIURB

two distributions. This is only a preliminary data and further analyses are needed to ascertain the
impact of coordination on the spreading of political news on Facebook.
Tab. 13. Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) results for the engagement of the news shared by
coordinated vs. non-coordinated entities before 2018 (on the left) and 2019 (on the right) elections.

Automated content analysis
To analyze the content shared in a coordinated way by the entities we relied on the “titles” and
“descriptions” of the news stories, short texts that Facebook users can directly read on the
platform without clicking any links. The texts were lemmatized and a topic modelling analysis
was run (Blei et al., 2003; Blei 2012; Phan et al., 2008). We estimate 60 topics in the 2018
dataset and 75 in the 2019 dataset using the maximum log-likelihood approach (Griffiths,
Steyvers, 2004) for a number of topics ranging from 2 to 100. We identify the topics more likely
to appear in the corpus based on marginal topic distributions (Sievert, Shirley 2014). Finally, the
quantity of news items mentioning the main political leaders and the partisan leaning
(MP-MPAS, Giglietto et al., 2019b) of the coordinated social media entities have been assessed.
We checked the domains shared by the coordinated networks against a “blacklists” of
disinformation sources (“Butac.it”, “Bufale.net” and “bufalopedia”) already used for this purpose
(e.g. Fletcher et al., 2018; Lovari, Martino, Righetti, forthcoming) to ascertain whether these

domains were already known for publishing controversial content, such as “fake” and
hyperpartisan news. We also checked the coordinated entities against a list of Facebook pages
already identified as sources of problematic information (Di Benedetto Montaccini, 2019;
Mastinu, 2019).
