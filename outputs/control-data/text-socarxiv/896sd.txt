Abstract
INTRODUCTION: ReAttach is a trans-diagnostic tailored intervention based on a
conceptualization model. The intervention includes arousal-regulation, multiple sensory
processing, conceptualization, affective mentalization and associative memory formation
(active learning). Autism Spectrum Disorder is a clinical diagnosis for a heterogeneous group
of individuals who experience pervasive neurodevelopmental problems including perceiving
the world in a fragmented way: the pre-conceptual state of mind. Tailored ReAttach sessions
support individuals with ASD to develop a coherent sense of the self and the world.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe how a to tailor a ReAttach session to the
individual state of mind of individuals with ASD.
METHOD: ReAttach-C.A.T. is a Computer Adaptive Tool, built to assist therapists to map
the individual state of mind before the start of ReAttach sessions. The instrument is in its
early stage of development.
RESULTS: A group of 52 patients with complex developmental challenges were interviewed
by their ReAttach therapist, using the inclusive ReAttach-C.A.T. Mapping the individual
state of mind in co-creation with the individual with ASD, makes sense and is helpful for a
variety of reasons. It also sheds a new light on the Forms of Vitality of the co-creators.

Introduction

ReAttach Protocol for Complexity?

ReAttach therapy strives to facilitate optimal
conditions for processing sensory information,
cognitions, emotions and events (Bartholomeus,
2012) (Bartholomeus, 2015). It claims to be a transdiagnostic approach: ReAttach applies to the whole
array of trans-diagnostic symptomatology networks
across neuropsychiatric presentations (Petter, 2018).
The intervention can be adjusted to treat most
emotional,
psychological,
developmental,
behavioral or physical challenges (neurorehabilitation/top-sports)
(WeerkampBartholomeus, 2018).
Although ReAttach is a tailored approach for all
individuals receiving ReAttach sessions,
there is an urge to explicitly tailor the intervention
even more for individuals with autism spectrum
disorders (ASD), neuro-rehabilitation or psychogeriatrics. The tailored version of ReAttach helps to
overcome the developmental arrest of individuals
with ASD or neuro-developmental disorders and
many psychologists were eager to learn about this
specialization.
At least partially due to a waiting list for supervised
trainings, many psychologists were so eager to
work with ASD that they started without learning
the adaptations. It was exciting to experience
whether or not they would succeed in activation of
growth. It was disappointing to find out that basic
ReAttach training was not enough to learn how to
provide the ReAttach for autism even though the
therapists had lots of diagnostic and clinical
experience in the field of ASD.
In this article it is not my goal to write about the
ReAttach protocol for autism. I have done so
elsewhere (Weerkamp-Bartholomeus, 2018) and it
turned out to be insufficient. A diagnosed-based
ReAttach protocol is an oversimplification of the
individual complexity and unusable to embrace the
complexity of the individual’s state of mind.
First, I will explore why it is so difficult to learn to
adapt ReAttach to individuals with ASD. Later on I
will describe the first steps that are taken to solve
this difficulty: A Computer Adaptive Tool (C.A.T.)
in combination with a manual (WeerkampBartholomeus, 2018) might help to map the
individual complexity and to make better decisions
in designing ReAttach therapy sessions for
individuals with ASD.

ASD refers to a complex and heterogeneous area of
clinical characteristics (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) which highly overlap with other
clinical neuropsychiatric disorders. Adapting
ReAttach according the ASD diagnosis is too
simplistic and turned out to only alleviate some
amount of distress. That was disappointing because
the aim of ReAttach for ASD is to activate
development in terms of multiple sensory
processing, coherence, conceptualization, affective
mentalization, self-refection, self-regulation,
autonomy and pro-active coping.
I previously assumed that ReAttach had to be
different for individuals with ASD because at the
start of the sessions these individuals are in the preconceptual stage of development (WeerkampBartholomeus P. , 2018). This literally means that,
for various reasons, they can’t process multisensory
information in coherent concepts yet.
ReAttach contains a social cognitive training
component that is based on a conceptualization
model. At first, we develop a coherent self,
differentiation between the self and others, later we
develop theory of mind, affective mentalization and
finally we develop a sense of relationships in which
we have no part. Taking into account the preconceptual state of mind at the start of the ReAttach
sessions, the social cognitive training component
consists of new skills. That is why we need extra
guidance and instructions and why professionals
need perfectly attunement at the level of proximal
development of each individual with ASD.
A second difference with so called neuro-typical
individuals with diagnoses other than ASD that I
expected was that the Social Reward System might
be under-activated in individuals (Bartholomeus,
2012) with ASD. A consequence of that, is that
especially children with ASD, are more interested
in objects than in people. We need to pay extra
attention and wait until the individual with ASD is
taking social initiative towards the therapist instead
of the other way around.
A third difference that might be important for
ReAttach therapists is that some individuals with
ASD have no imagination. This needs to be
assessed so it can be addressed during the ReAttach
trainings.

Weerkamp – Bartholomeus P. How to tailor a transdiagnostic intervention to the individual state of mind

It turned out to be extremely difficult for the
therapists to decide for their patients whether the
basic ReAttach Protocol (Bartholomeus, 2012) was
sufficient or not. The more complex the clinical
presentation, the more important it became to
understand the individual state of mind in ReAttach
terms rather than in diagnostic categories. The urge
arose to develop a trans-diagnostic ReAttach for
Complexity Protocol to design tailored
interventions.
An inclusive tool for neurodiversity
The main goal was to explicitly distinguish
elements of the ReAttach intervention that need to
be tailored for individual patients and to draw a line
between the basic ReAttach Protocol and
specialization. The ReAttach for Autism protocol
was written to describe most common adaptations
for individuals with autism, however it didn’t cover
individual differences over time. Instead of writing
a large catalogue with different ReAttach protocols
for different types of patients it seemed more
realistic and efficient to write a manual with
adaptations for specific elements that embody
ReAttach itself:

Arousal regulation
The Social Reward System
Multiple Sensory Processing
Protection
Joint Attention
Conceptualization
Imagination
Communication
Emotion Regulation

10. Coping
Clinicians who work with complex patients are
well trained in analyzing clinical presentations, but
it makes perfectly sense to add the perspective of
the patient to get a clearer picture. If it is not possible
to include a patient’s view the option to interview a
parent, partner of care-giver will be chosen instead.
The therapist will communicate that a survey is
used to tailor the ReAttach sessions in order to
facilitate optimal conditions for individual growth.
For each of the above items, 1 main question and 4
sub-questions were formulated in order to process
the input of the patient in mapping his or her
individual state of mind. A decision tree model was
used to find out which areas should be adapted
from the patient’s point of view. The therapist was
instructed to interview the patient and offer time to
argue about the questions and talk about himself.
The Decision Tree Structure
The structure of the interview is based on asking the
patient to define himself by identification with a one
of 2 groups of characteristics. Figure 1 represents
the decision tree structure of the first main question
which is about the choice between stressed or calm:
“Some people are stressed, and other people are
calm. To which group do you belong?” The subquestions provide the opportunity to either nuance
the choice or to confirm this choice.
The interview items were divided in A and B
reflecting either too much or too little and for each
item a main question was designed with 4 subquestions:

The chance of confirmation or nuancing the answer
of the main question was estimated 50%. In the
early stage of exploring the benefit of this type of
tool this was the starting point. This provided the
following percentile scores based on confirmation
of the answer on the main question by the subquestions 1,2,3 or 4:
Questions 1,2
percentile 90
Questions 1,2,3 percentile 96
Questions 1,2,4 percentile 93
Questions 1,3,4 percentile 85
Questions 1,2,3,4percentile 99
Percentile scores 84-97 (high) and 98-100 (very
high) were selected as indicators to tailor the
ReAttach intervention and use the manual.
The tool was meant to give a rough indication of
the items that need to be adapted for ReAttach
sessions in term of advice: “You can provide a
regular ReAttach session” or “Please check the
chapter in your manual about this item and act
accordingly”

Mapping
A coloured score-form was designed to map the
patient’s view and to gain an oversight of the
complexity before consulting the manual.

ReAttach-C.A.T. Manual
Since average or above average scores refer to
basic ReAttach sessions, the manual only focuses
on high and very high scores. After mapping the
individual complexity by assessment of the
patient’s view, the professional input of the clinician
and manual are added to broaden the perspective.

The manual is directly connected to the individual
map by the same items and A / B structure in
separate chapters. Besides guidelines, the manual
asks questions and provides instructions for further
examination. All chapters have the same content
structure:
Meaning
A short explanation of the meaning of the high
score and its consequences for the patient’s
functioning and the ReAttach intervention.
Examination
Does the patient recognize the results? Does the
therapist
recognize
the
results?
Does it match with the clinical presentation?
Perception
How to objectify this high score? What may the
therapist expect to perceive when this item is being
regulated for optimization?
How to act
Concrete recommendations for advanced ReAttach
sessions. Exercises to improve the results.

Results
After training the first group of ReAttach therapists
working with individuals with complex
neurodevelopmental challenges, a sample of 52
individual maps was gathered. Written informed
consent was obtained.
Table 1 presents the percentage of high and very
high scores on the Computer Adaptive Tool.
Out of 52 cases (male 37%, age 7-65, M37, SD
9.5) there was only 1 individual map with only
average or above average scores: a candidate for
the basic ReAttach Protocol.
All of the 52 individual maps were unique. As
expected from previous practical research
(Weerkamp-Bartholomeus, 2018) more than 50%
of the individuals reported significant problems
with arousal regulation, multiple sensory
processing, over-protection or over-demand,
emotion regulation and coping. Individuals who
didn’t respond well on the basic intervention now
could benefit from the new insights and overall the
tailored approach was received with motivation and
enthusiasm.

Discussion
Why is it so difficult to work with individuals with
ASD or other complex developmental challenges
spontaneously? I would like to give this some
consideration.
During the training of the ReAttach-C.A.T. it was
comforting to see how difficult it was to suppress
the natural tendency of oversimplification.
Although all therapists had great knowledge about
their patient groups, there was a tendency to neglect
complicated factors or to zoom in on obvious
solutions. Complexity itself was also the object of
simplification in cases where the professional could
not imagine a positive developmental outcome at
all. Just the mapping of individual complexity was
rather helpful in suppressing this tendency to
oversimplify: it just reminded not to.
The basic ReAttach Protocol demands attunement
and the professional skills to tailor the intervention
for individual with less complex clinical
presentations. In their therapeutic relationship with
complex patients however, they seem to know
“what” to do and “why” they should act in this
way, but they experience problems in “how” to do
it. The concept of Forms of Vitality (Stern, 1985)
(Stern, 2010) (Krueger, 2019) might shed some
light on this problem.
Forms of Vitality (FV) specify the overall style of
an action (Krueger, 2019) and they are often coregulated by others. The social perceptual world of
individuals with ASD might be organized by
different FV (Klin, Jones, Schultz, & Volkmar,
2003) which provides a possible explanation for the
difficulties in designing the proper FD for the
ReAttach intervention: this “how” must be

designed in co-creation with the individual with
ASD. Personally, I find this a beautiful concept of
inclusion and equality: it emphasizes the humble
role of the therapist who as a music conductor
supports the musician (the individual with ASD). It
needs to be a two-way tailored ReAttach session
design. In other words: one explanation for the need
of this tool is that ReAttach therapists feel insecure
in the company of individuals with complex
developmental challenges such as ASD, because
their FVs don’t interact smoothly enough to know
“how” to co-create in general.
Another consideration is that therapists who are
familiar in working with individuals with ASD
might have a strong tendency to compensate
feelings of social awkwardness by adapting their
FV in an attempt to support the individual with
ASD. The co-creation of a special ReAttach
session for ASD will not succeed if there is too
much compensation. Instead of making all this
beautiful music for the individual with ASD so it
sounds great, a ReAttach therapist should co-create
as a conductor, accepting the unique FV and cocreate a masterpiece as part of an exceptional team!

Recommendations
For individuals with ASD it is always important to
take medical problems into account (Trajkovski,
2018), (Poletaev, 2018). We failed to include this
with our ReAttach form, which will be adapted. All
the materials will be evaluated and improved by the
engagement of all who are involved: teachers,
therapists, students, parents, partners and scientists.
Mapping neuro-diversity raises an awareness of
individual
uniqueness
and
equality.

Asking the patients (which we tend to call students
instead) to explain their own uniqueness is actually
a step forward in inclusion.
