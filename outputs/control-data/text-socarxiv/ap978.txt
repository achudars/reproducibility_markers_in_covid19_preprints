ABSTRACT
We study how variation in short-term credit costs shapes U.S. entrepreneurship.
To do so, we implement identification through heteroskedasticity on a new index
of daily U.S. firm formation from 1988 to 2014. A one percentage point increase
in the 3-month T-Bill is associated with a 6.4% drop in the number of new firms
founded, and a 3.2% drop in the quality-adjusted quantity of new firms founded,
seven days later. The results are robust to economic policy uncertainty,
recession periods, and to multiple heteroskedasticity regimes. The rate of firm
formation gets back to baseline six weeks after the shock, and there is no
corresponding overcompensation, suggesting the loss is permanent.

I. Introduction
In the United States, the Federal Reserve (through the federal funds rate) targets the
short-term interest rate with the goal of promoting sound economic and employment
growth. Nowhere is the relationship from interest rates to growth assumed more important
than in entrepreneurship. Startups account for virtually all employment growth in the
U.S. (Haltiwanger et al, 2013), and are the theoretical mechanism through which
innovation and reallocation occurs in the economy (Schumpeter, 1942; Aghion and
Howitt, 1992; Akcigit and Kerr, 2018). However, there is little empirical evidence on
whether and how startup formation responds to changes in interest rates. Does U.S.
entrepreneurship change with the short-term interest rate? If so, are the most ambitious
projects affected or are they instead the lower quality ones? How long does any negative
(or positive) impact last, and is it compensated by future changes in firm entry?
On the one hand, there are several reasons to believe entrepreneurs would respond
to a change in interest rates. Empirical evidence shows they are often cash constrained in
starting new businesses (Hurst and Lusardi, 2004; Corradin and Popov, 2015), and they
increase their entrepreneurial activity when they receive a cash windfall such as an
exogenous increase to their housing value (Adelino et al, 2015, 2016) or the sudden liquidity
of their existing stock holdings (Stuart and Sorenson, 2003). The balance sheets of startups
tend to include significant personal and business credit (Robb and Robinson, 2014), and
young firms increase their employment when their working capital requirements drop (Barrot
and Nanda, 2020). Besides these direct effects on startups, changes in interest rates also
change product demand, personal credit, and potentially optimism. Together, all these effects
would predict that a reduction in the short-term credit cost (i.e., a drop in the short-term
interest rate) should allow some marginal entrepreneurs to decide to undertake productive

2

investments and consequently be more likely to start a company given additionally available
financing.
On the other hand, there are also reasons to be more skeptical that short-term changes
in credit would be consequential for startup formation. Most entrepreneurship occurs through
a series of stages, such as idea generation, planning, and growth, that evolve slowly over time
(Gans, Scott, and Stern, 2020). It is not clear that entrepreneurs are actually considering
credit costs in their choices, and any change may be too short-lived to impact effective entry.
In this view, short term changes in credit rates should not impact the total level of startup
formation.
Empirical evidence on the response of U.S. entrepreneurship to interest rates appears
to be missing. While existing research has clearly showed the value of improving financing
institutions and person-specific capital on entrepreneurial entry, 2 these institutional changes
are substantively different from short-term changes in the cost of capital created by variation
in interest rates. Yet, it is indeed this type of short-term credit changes that are usually most
relevant to financial decisions, and represent the most common levers for policy makers to
activate the economy, and manage the process of economic growth.
In this paper, we provide original estimates on the impact of short-term interest rates
on overall quantity and quality of entrepreneurship in the United States. Using a novel index
of quality (i.e., growth likelihood)3 adjusted daily number U.S. business registrations from
1988 to 2014, we use identification through heteroskedasticity to estimate the impact of

2

A significant amount of work has already documented the broad importance of credit for entrepreneurship. For
example, survey data shows that a large portion of startups rely on credit (Robb and Robinson, 2014);
difference-in-differences cross-regional studies have demonstrated that improving financing institutions
increases firm formation (Kerr and Nanda, 2010; Chatterji and Seamans, 2012; Chava et al, 2013; Cerqueiro et
al, 2016; Kirshnan et al, 2015; Guzman, 2020); and studies using unexpected shocks to person-specific capital,
such as a housing boom or inheritance, find that additional capital leads to entrepreneurial entry (Hurst and
Lusardi, 2004; Adelino et al, 2015, 2016; Corradin and Popov, 2015).

Our index is simply an implementation of the entrepreneurial quality approach in Guzman and Stern (2020).

changes in short-term interest rates on entrepreneurship. Consistent with the idea that shortterm credit costs matter, we identify a negative and significant effect of interest rate changes
on overall entrepreneurship rates. A one percentage point increase in the U.S. 3-month T-Bill
is associated with a drop of 6.4% in the number of new firms founded seven days later. This
reduction lasts six weeks after the shock and there is no corresponding overcompensation,
suggesting the loss is permanent. However, highlighting that it is the marginally less
valuable projects that are being incorporated, we see our coefficient drop by half when we
adjust for measures of firm quality rather than simply the number of firms. These results are
stable across different time-periods and robust to an overidentification test using different
regimes. In contrast to a view that assumes entrepreneurial entry is only influenced over long
periods of time, the quick response we observe in our index (within a week) is consistent with
emerging evidence that entrepreneurship responds very quickly to economic shocks, such as
the significant changes in both the number and composition of new firms observed
immediately after the COVID-19 lockdowns (Fazio et al, 2020; Haltiwanger, 2020).
Before proceeding, we briefly outline our identification approach, since it has not
been previously used in entrepreneurship research. Figure 1 documents the
heteroskedastic relationship that is the basis of our identification strategy. It plots two
measures over time. The first is the running six month standard deviation of the U.S. risk
free short-term interest rate (3-month T-Bill). We observe significant variation in this
measure—that is, there is heteroskedasticity. The second is the running six month
correlation between the interest rate and the log of our daily index of quality-adjusted
entrepreneurship, called RECPI, which measures the number of daily firm registration
events in that day adjusted for their estimated quality at founding.4 There is appreciable

and construction of this index is explained in detail in Sections III and IV.

comovement between the two indexes. The correlation value between the two is on
average slightly positive, potentially driven by unobserved variables that influence both
the interest rate and entrepreneurship in the economy. However, when the interest rate
varies more substantially, it plays a more significant role in determining outcomes, and
the correlation turns more negative. We take advantage of these changes in correlation to
identify the effect of interest rates on entrepreneurship.
Intuitively, if we consider the entrepreneurship process as determined by interest
rates 𝑖𝑡 , and other unobserved factors 𝜖𝑡
𝐸𝑡 = 𝛽𝑖𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡
then the role of 𝑖𝑡 in determining changes in 𝐸𝑡 is more relevant when there is more
variance in 𝑖𝑡 .
Figures 2A and 2B plot a simulation to show this clearly, using two variance
regimes for 𝑖𝑡 , but the same 𝛽 and same 𝜖𝑡 across regimes. Figure 2A is a low-interest
rate regime. In this regime, the realized observations are scattered all over the place
because most of the variance comes from 𝜖𝑡 . On the other hand, in Figure 2B, the high
variance regime, the role of the interest rate becomes more relevant and the slope of the
curve is now traced out. We implement the approach of Rigobon (2003), who shows how
one can take advantage of these differences in slope across regimes to back out 𝛽. As
long as changes in the variance of other determinants are not too correlated with the
variance of interest rates, and 𝛽 is stable across regimes (an assumption that we are able
to test) it is identified (Lewis, 2019).
The results in this paper contribute to a range of long-standing literatures that
connect credit constraints to entrepreneurship. This includes work directly emphasizing
entrepreneurial cash constraints and their impact on the economy (Evans and Leighton,
1989; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; Holtz-Eakin et al, 1994; Gentry and Hubbard, 2004;
5

Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998; see Kerr and Nanda, 2009, for a review), work assessing
financing institutions and entrepreneurship (Chatterji and Seamans, 2012; Kerr and Nanda,
2010; Adelino et al 2015, 2016; Corradin and Popov, 2015, Cerqueiro et al, 2016; Guzman,
2020; Barrot and Nanda, 2020), and macroeconomic estimates of the impact of monetary
policy in general (Romer and Romer, 1989; Romer and Romer, 2004; Rigobon and Sack,
2004; Coibion, 2012; Gertler and Karadi, 2015; Tenreyro and Thwaites, 2016; Nakamura
and Steinsson, 2018).
Vis-à-vis this prior work, the present paper provides at least three contributions.
The first, and most important, is that our paper is the first paper to study changes in the
high frequency (daily) incidence of firm formation and how contemporaneous variation in
financial variables influence it. In particular, we show how variation in a common
macro-economic variable, the 3-month T-Bill, indeed influences the entry of new firms,
and the heterogeneity across this entry. This evidence provides important information for
both macroeconomic financial policy, and microeconomic understanding of the nature of
firm formation and credit. Future work on this area is likely to be fruitful.
Second, our paper is also the first to estimate the average treatment effects of
financing costs in the U.S. economy as a whole. Whereas prior work had focused on
identifying variation in a small portion of the data for convenience (such as those
individuals receiving an inheritance), our identification approach instead focuses on the
total number of firms in the United States and the way credit influences them. This
allows our estimates a much clearer policy application, as well as providing novel
evidence consistent with U.S. entrepreneurs, in toto, being cash constrained.
Finally, third, from a data perspective, we introduced a new index of firm
formation using business registrations that allows observing the daily variation in new
firm registrations. Recent evidence from COVID-19 shows daily variation in firm
6

formation can be significant and respond quickly with macroeconomic events (Fazio et al,
2020; Haltiwanger, 2020), yet other potential sources of data (such as tax returns) do not
allow the type of time granularity our data does. We suspect our index would also be of
inherent value to future work.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we explain in
more detail the identification through heteroskedasticity approach. In Section III, we
explain conceptually our approach to measuring quality, which is simply an
implementation of Guzman and Stern (2020). We describe in Section IV our underlying
data (state-level business registrations), and explain how it allows us to observe daily
variation in firm formation. Section V includes all the empirical results. Finally, Section
VI concludes.

II. Identifying the Entrepreneurship Response Through Heteroskedasticity
Identification through heteroskedasticity is an identification approach widely used in
macroeconomics to model time-series relationships that are co-determined. Consider a
general setup for the interdependent relationship between entrepreneurship and interest
rates, as in the following VAR model:
𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛾𝐸𝑡 +𝜂𝑡
𝐸𝑡 = 𝛼1 + 𝛽𝑖𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡
Where 𝑖𝑡 is the interest rate, 𝐸𝑡 is the index of entrepreneurship, 𝛼0 and 𝛼1 are constants,
and 𝜂𝑡 and 𝜖𝑡 are macroeconomic shocks that we do not observe but that influence the
interest rate and entrepreneurship, respectively. The variance of 𝜂𝑡 and 𝜖𝑡 are 𝜎𝜂2 and 𝜎𝜖2 .
Usual VAR estimates (including SVAR) impose lag restrictions, such as a lack of
contemporaneous effects, that are unrealistic for this setting due to co-determinacy. The
heteroskedasticity approach adds flexibility by taking advantage of the fact that changes
7

in the variance of variables in a VAR model also change the relative importance of each
variable in determining the response. If the independent variable is heteroskedastic, and
the underlying parameter stable, then this heteroskedasticity can create enough variation
to identify the parameter of interest.
The initial approach is developed in Rigobon (2003), which still continues to be
the most common implementation identification through heteroskedasticity. Rigobon
(2003) focuses on a two-regime framework, with high and low variance. In Rigobon and
Sack (2004), they apply this framework to interest rates to determine their impact on asset
prices. Our paper is mostly based on this setup, using entrepreneurship rather than asset
prices as the outcome variable.5
To begin to understand how one might extract 𝛽, we take another look at Figures
2A and 2B. These figures are two simulations of the VAR model (assuming 𝛼0 , 𝛼1 , and 𝛾
as zero for simplicity). Both figures have the same values of 𝜎𝜖2 = 2 and 𝛽 = −0.5, but we
change the variance of the interest rate, 𝜎𝑖2 , across figures to create heteroskedasticity.
Figure 2A, representing a low variance regime, has 𝜎𝑖2 = 2, while Figure 2B has 𝜎𝑖2 = 5.
While 𝛽 has the same value under both regimes, the change in 𝜎𝑖2 changes how much the
entrepreneurship response is determined by 𝑖𝑡 versus its idiosyncratic component 𝜖𝑡 .
Figure 2A has mostly idiosyncratic variation (from 𝜖𝑡 ), while Figure 2B traces out the
entrepreneurship response. Rigobon (2003) provides a formalization of how to use these
changes in information to recover 𝛽.
Specifically, suppose there are two regimes of 𝜎𝜂2 , high volatility and low
volatility, indexed by 𝑠 ∈ {1,2}. 𝛽 and 𝛾 are stable across these two regimes (an
̂ 𝑠 for each regime is defined by:
assumption that will be tested). The covariance matrix Ω

There are six unknowns in this system (𝛾, 𝛽, 𝜎𝜂,1

) and two

covariance matrices. This provides six equations which can be solved as long as the
matrix is non-degenerate.
Then, 𝛽 is solved by

𝛽 = 𝜔12,𝑠 −𝛾𝜔11,𝑠

And, after some algebra, 6 𝛾 is the solution to the following quadratic:
[𝜔11,1 𝜔12,2 − 𝜔12,1 𝜔11,2 ]𝛾 2 − [𝜔11,1 𝜔22,2 − 𝜔22,1 𝜔11,2 ]𝛾 + [𝜔12,1 𝜔22,2 − 𝜔22,1 𝜔12,2 ] = 0
There are two solutions to this equation. One is 𝛾, 𝛽 and the other is 𝛾 ∗ =
1/𝛽, 𝛽 ∗ = 1/𝛾, reflecting the two ways that the system can be solved.

III. Measuring the Quality and Quantity of Entrepreneurship
We next proceed to describe a general approach to measuring our outcome variable – U.S.
quality-adjusted entrepreneurship. This approach borrows directly from Guzman and Stern
(2015, 2017, 2020); therefore, what follows is simply an abridged re-statement of this prior
work. 7 We refer the reader to the cited papers for more detail.

These derivations are direct copies of Rigobon (2003); we refer the reader to this paper for the algebraic
details.
7
This section draws partially from Guzman and Stern (2015, 2017, 2020), where these measurement statistics
are originally introduced.

9

Guzman and Stern propose a method to estimate quality using predictive analytics and
business registration records by combining three interrelated insights. First, because the
challenges to reaching a growth outcome as a sole proprietorship are formidable, a practical
requirement for any entrepreneur to achieve growth is business registration (as a corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company). This practical requirement allows for the
formation of a population sample of entrepreneurs “at risk” of growth at a similar (and
foundational) stage of the entrepreneurial process. Second, it is possible to potentially
distinguish among business registrants through the measurement of founding choices
observable at or close to the time of registration. For example, we can measure start-up
characteristics (which result from the initial entrepreneurial choices in our model) such as
whether the founders name the firm after themselves (eponymy), whether the firm is
organized in order to facilitate equity financing (e.g., registering as a corporation or in
Delaware), and whether the firm seeks intellectual property protection (e.g., a patent or
trademark). Third, though rare, there exist meaningful growth outcomes (such as achieving
an IPO or high-value acquisition) for some firms. Combining these insights, we estimate
entrepreneurial quality by estimating the relationship between observed growth outcomes and
start-up characteristics.
That is, for a firm i, born at time t, with at-birth start-up characteristics 𝐾𝑖,𝑡 , we
observe growth outcome 𝑔𝑖,𝑡+𝑠 s years after founding and estimate:
𝜃𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑃(𝑔𝑖,𝑡+𝑠 |𝐾𝑖,𝑡 ) = 𝑓(𝛼 + 𝛽𝐾𝑖 ,𝑡 )
and we use the predicted value of this regression as our measure of entrepreneurial quality.
As long as the process by which start-up characteristics map to growth remains stable over
time (an assumption that appears valid in the data8), this mapping allows us to form an

8

See Appendix Table B2 of Guzman and Stern (2020).

10

estimate of entrepreneurial quality from founding characteristics for any business registrant
within our sample.
We use these estimates to generate two entrepreneurship statistics proposed by
Guzman and Stern that capture the level of entrepreneurial quality, quantity, and quality
adjusted quantity for a given set of startups founded on a specific day.
The Entrepreneurial Quality Index (EQI). To create an index of entrepreneurial
quality for any group of firms we simply take the average quality of firms founded in a day.
𝐸𝑄𝐼𝑡 =

1
∑ 𝜃𝑖,𝑡
𝑁𝑡
𝑖∈{𝐼𝑡 }

where {𝐼𝑡 } represents the set of all firms in time period t, and 𝑁𝑡 represents the number of firms
in 𝑡.
The Regional Entrepreneurship Cohort Potential Index (RECPI). The overall inherent
potential for a cohort of startups combines both the quality of entrepreneurship and the
number of firms (a measure of quantity). To do so, we define RECPI as simply 𝐸𝑄𝐼
multiplied by the number of firms founded on that day:
𝑅𝐸𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑡 = 𝐸𝑄𝐼𝑡 × 𝑁𝑡
Since our index multiplies the average probability of a firm in 𝑡 to achieve growth (quality)
by the number of firms, it is, by definition, the expected number of growth events from a
cohort given the startup characteristics of that group. This measure of course abstracts away
from the ability to realize the performance of startups founded within a given cohort, and
instead can be interpreted as a measure of the “potential” of a cohort given the “intrinsic”
quality of firms at birth. Together, EQI and RECPI offer researchers the ability to undertake
detailed evaluations of entrepreneurial quality and quality-adjusted quantity over time.

11

IV. Data Overview: Measuring Daily New Entrepreneurship in the U.S.
Building on the entrepreneurial quality approach, a key data innovation of our paper is to
use it to develop a daily measure of U.S. entrepreneurship based on firm founding events
and their characteristics at founding. This section describes how our daily index is
developed. The index may be of research interest in its own right, as it is the first measure
of U.S. firm formation that provides time granularity at the level of daily
frequency.Business Registration Records and Entrepreneurial Quality Estimates
Our U.S. daily index of entrepreneurship is built from business registration records
collected as part of a broader effort for the Startup Cartography Project (Andrews et al,
2020). Business registration is the act of formally creating a legal entity—a corporation,
partnership, or LLC—with which to conduct business. We record 35 million
registrations, accounting for all firms registered between 1988 and 2014 in the District of
Columbia and 49 U.S. states, 9 representing 99.6% of all U.S. economic activity.10 We
limit our sample to the set that is either (a) a for-profit firm in the local jurisdiction or (b) a
for-profit firm whose jurisdiction is Delaware but whose principal office address is in the
local state. Our analysis therefore excludes non-profit organizations as well as companies
whose primary location is not in the state. This data construction is explained in detail in
Guzman and Stern (2020), and versions of this data are also used in Guzman and Stern (2015,
2017), Fazio et al (2019), Guzman (2018), Catalini et al (2019a, 2019b), and others.
As in that prior work, for each observation, we construct variables related to: (i)
growth outcomes (IPO or significant acquisition); (ii) firm characteristics based on business

9

We are unable to include local firms in Delaware (i.e. those actually doing business locally in the state)
because Delaware jurisdiction plays an important, and unique, role for corporate governance choices for all
firms in the United States. It is important to highlight that we do include (and take advantage of) all Delaware
jurisdiction companies registered as doing business activity in any state outside Delaware.

12

registration observables; and (iii) firm characteristics based on external data that can be
directly linked to the firm (e.g. patents, trademarks).
i. Growth Outcomes. The growth outcome, Growth, is a dummy variable equal to 1
if the firm has an initial public offering (IPO) or is acquired at a meaningful
positive valuation within 6 years of registration as reported in SDC Platinum.
ii. Firm Characteristic Measures Based on Business Registration Data. We first
create two binary measures that relate to how the firm is registered: Corporation,
which captures whether the firm is a corporation rather than an LLC or
partnership, and Delaware, equal to one if the firm is registered in Delaware. We
then create five additional measures based directly on the name of the firm.
Eponymous is equal to 1 if the first, middle, or last name of the top managers is
part of the name of the firm itself.11 Our last measure relates to the structure of
the firm name. Based on our review of naming patterns of growth-oriented
startups versus the full business registration database, a striking feature of growthoriented firms is that the vast majority of their names are at most two words (plus
perhaps one additional word to capture the organizational form, e.g. “Inc.”). We
define Short Name to be equal to one if the entire firm name has three or less
words, and zero otherwise.12 We then create several measures based on how the
firm name reflects the industry or sector within which the firm is operating, taking
advantage of the industry categorization of the US Cluster Mapping Project (“US
CMP”) (Delgado, Porter, and Stern, 2016) and a text analysis approach. We
develop eight such measures. The first three measures are associated with broad

11

Belenzon, Chatterji, and Daley (2017, 2019) perform a more detailed analysis of the interaction between
eponymy and firm performance, finding an important negative relationship between an intent to use equity
financing and eponymy.

Companies such as Akamai or Biogen have sharp and distinctive names, whereas more traditional businesses
often have long and descriptive names (e.g., “New England Commercial Realty Advisors, Inc.”).

13

industry sectors and include whether a firm can be identified as local (Local),
traded (Traded) or resource intensive (Resource Intensive). The other five
measures capture industry groups in high technology sectors that are typically
associated with high growth firms, including whether the firm is within the
biotech (Biotech Sector), e-commerce (E-Commerce), other information
technology (IT), medical devices (Medical Devices) or semiconductors
(Semiconductor) space.
iii. Firm Characteristic Measures Based on External Observables. We also construct
two measures related to quality based on data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. Patent is equal to 1 if a firm holds a patent application within the first year
and 0 otherwise. We include patents that are filed by the firm within the first year
of registration and patents that are assigned to the firm within the first year from
another entity (e.g., an inventor or another firm). Our second measure,
Trademark, is equal to 1 if a firm applies for trademark protection within a year
from registration.
Entrepreneurial Quality Logit Model. We next consider how these founding
observables predict follow-on growth. In Table 1, we replicate the analysis in Andrews et al
(2020) and report the incidence rate ratios of the coefficients of a logit model on all startups
founded between 1988 and 2010, using our binary growth outcome as the dependent variable.
The model includes founding state fixed effects and reports robust standard errors. Corporate
governance appears important. Startups founded as corporations are 187% more likely to
grow. We also find large effects for the choice of name: firms with a short name are 123%
more likely to grow, while eponymous firms are 71% less likely to grow. Intellectual
property similarly predicts performance. Firms with a trademark at founding are more than 3
times more likely to grow, and those with a patent are 23 times more likely to grow.
14

Interestingly, the choice of jurisdiction—whether in a local state or in Delaware—appears to
truly influence the probability of growth: firms in Delaware are 16 times more likely to
achieve this outcome. These two variables - intellectual property and jurisdiction choice interact. Firms that both have a patent and are registered in Delaware are 93 times more likely
to grow. The coefficients for our name-based sector dummies are also significant, though the
magnitude appears lower than the effects of corporate form, name, intellectual property, and
jurisdiction choice. Bringing all these together, a short-named Delaware corporation with a
patent is 500 times more likely to grow than a local LLC. The predicted value of this
regression is the estimated entrepreneurial quality of each firm.
We aggregate this estimated quality based on the date of business registration into two
daily indexes of entrepreneurship for all business days between 1988 and 2014.13 The first
measure, Obs, is the raw number of observations registered on each date in our data. The
second measure, RECPI, is the quality adjusted quantity for each day.
A. Measures of Short-Term Interest Rates.
Consistent with the literature, we use the 3-month Treasury Bill (T-Bill) Rate as a
measure of the short-term interest rate. We downloaded the 3-month T-Bill daily data
from the Federal Reserve website14 for all business days from 1988 to 2014. To simplify
the interpretation of our estimates, we multiply the rate by 100 so that a one point
increase in our measure represents a one percentage point increase in the interest rate.
Summary Statistics. Table 2 shows the summary statistics of our data. We have
6,755 observations. The average day in our data has 5,079 new firm registrations in the
United States, with an average quality of 0.001, and a RECPI of 2.8. We choose to use

13

Keeping only to business days is necessary for our empirical strategy because the interest rate only changes
during business days.

these measures in their natural log, to allow ease of interpretation of our coefficients as
the percentage change of entrepreneurship resulting from an interest rate change. The
mean of the Log(Obs) is 8.4 and the mean of Log(RECPI) is 1.0.

V. Empirical Results
We now proceed to the core of our paper, estimating the impact of interest rate changes
on U.S. entrepreneurship. We begin our analysis by presenting our main estimates, the
impact of the interest rate on firm formation seven days later, using two regimes—high
and low variance in interest rates. We focus on the firms founded seven days later, rather
than contemporaneously, to allow some time for the interest rate shock to diffuse in the
economy and influence the choices of entrepreneurs. After presenting our main results,
we present robustness tests using subsamples to show that our results are not driven by
recessionary periods, or by the low inflation period after 2008, and that they remain
robust after controlling for measures of economic policy uncertainty.

We then split our

data across four regimes to create six possible regime pairs, and perform an
overidentification test on our estimate by estimating our parameter across each possible
pair as in Rigobon and Sack (2004). The estimates, ranging from -.09 to -.025, paint a
consistent picture of a negative impact of interest rates on entrepreneurship and confirm
the broad stability of our parameter across samples and regimes. Next, we use lags and
leads of our dependent variable, both daily and weekly, to assess the threat of pre-trends
and dynamics of our estimate across time. We find no pre-trends, suggesting no
anticipatory response from entrepreneurs to the shock and indicating that our approach is
valid. After an initial drop, we see the flow of entrepreneurship recover after seven
weeks, but there is no overshooting response later on to compensate for the prior loss.
Finally, for completeness, we replicate our approach using measures of long-term (rather

than short-term) interest rates as the independent variable, such as the 20-year T-Bill, and
the spread between the 20-year and 3-month T-Bills. We find that both of these shocks
show pre-trends in our data (entrepreneurs respond before the rate increase); therefore,
our approach does not allow us to identify the impact of long-term rates on
entrepreneurship.

A. Main Estimates: Two Interest Rate Regimes
We begin by defining our two variance regimes. For all days in our sample, we estimate
the ten-day rolling variance 15 of the 3-month T-Bill. We then split the sample based on
this variance into a high variance regime (above the mean) and a low variance regime
(below the mean). In Table 3, we report the average variance of interest rates, the
average ten-day variance of our entrepreneurship indexes, and the average ten-day
correlation between the 3-month T-Bill and entrepreneurship under each regime. The
distribution of the data is representative of the skewness of the interest rate movements.
82% of the data is in the low variance regime, while only 18% of the data is in the high
variance regime. The variance of the T-Bill obviously increases from the low to the high
variance regime. However, we observe no change in the average variance of Log(RECPI)
or Log(Obs). An unreported regression using a dummy for the regime and interest rates
as the dependent variable evaluates the strength of the data for identification through
heteroskedasticity. The F-statistic of this regression is 653.16

15

While using ten days only allows a few observations with which to estimate the variance, we consider it a
cleaner approach as it will only include recent events in its estimate rather than the risk of longer lags.
16
Lewis (2019) shows that the identification approach can break down if there are proportional increases in the
variance of both treatment and outcome. He recommends running a regression with regime dummies on the
independent variable to assess the strength of identification when using identification through
heteroskedasticity. Specifically, he shows that our problem can also be represented as an instrumental variables
problem, where this regression represents the first stage. Lewis suggests using an F-statistic of 37 or higher as a
rule of thumb for strong identification.

17

Table 4 reports our main results. Column (1) is the coefficient from a naïve OLS
regression of the interest rate on Log(RECPI). This estimate is likely biased due to
endogeneity. The coefficient is -0.08. If valid, it would have suggested that a one
percentage point increase in the T-Bill rate results in an average 8% drop in the qualityadjusted quantity of entrepreneurship. Column (2) uses instead identification through
heteroskedasticity, reporting the estimate of 𝛽 in 500 bootstrapped samples. The
coefficient is much lower, -0.032, with a 95-percent confidence interval from -0.075 to
0.011. A one percentage point increase in the interest rate leads to an average drop of
3.2% in the flow of entrepreneurship, measured seven days later. Figure 3A plots a
histogram of the estimates across the 500 bootstrap samples for completeness.
We then repeat these estimates with Log(Obs), our quantity measure, as the
dependent variable in Columns (3) and (4). Both the OLS and the heteroskedasticity
estimates are higher than their RECPI counterparts. The naïve OLS coefficient in Column
(3) is -0.141. The heteroskedasticity estimate in Column (4) has a mean of -6.4%, and the
95 percent confidence interval ranges from -0.145 to 0.016. Figure 3B presents the
histogram of the bootstrapped estimates.
The difference in the coefficients between the quality-adjusted outcome and the
quantity outcome provides insight into the relative impact of interest rates across the firm
quality distribution. Consistent with a view that higher quality entrepreneurs are also
better able to find capital, our evidence suggests that it is the lower quality (less growth
oriented) entrepreneurs that appear to be particularly sensitive to changes in the interest
rate. Interestingly, these results stand in contrast to other work highlighting the sensitivity of
highly innovative ideas to the total supply of capital (Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf, 2013;
Rampini, 2004; Bernanke and Gertler, 1989). Understanding the sources of these

18

differences—such as the differential role of equity and bank financing in entrepreneurship—
is an important question for future work.

B. Robustness Tests: Subperiods, Policy Uncertainty, and Multiple Regimes
We next perform several tests to assess the robustness of our estimate. We begin in Table
5 by repeating our approach across two different subsamples. Our goal is to evaluate
whether our results are sensitive to the exclusion or inclusion of some specific time
periods within our data, and if there is enough stability in the estimate of 𝛽 we report.
Column (1) reports our main estimate from Table 4 for ease of comparability. Column
(2) looks at the two complete business cycles in our data where interest rates have
behaved normally, from March 1991 to December 2007. We do this to assess if our
estimate is an artifact of the Great Recession and its aftermath, particularly the low
interest rate levels during this time period. The estimate of 𝛽 is -0.047. Though not
statistically different from our main estimate, if anything, it suggests that the negative
response we document could be a little higher in time periods where the zero lower bound
of interest rates do not bind. Column (3) instead uses our full time period but removes
the dates that fall within any NBER-dated recession. We do this to evaluate the
possibility that the high variance in interest rates is correlated with recessions somehow,
and therefore our relationship is not indicative of short-term credit changes, but instead
large shocks (as in recessions). The effect remains roughly stable. Together, we interpret
these two results as consistent with the idea that the negative relationship between interest
rates and entrepreneurship is quite stable across the different economic situations the
United States has faced since 1988 (though we recognize that the relationship between
our two variables might change over a longer time period).

19

In Table 6, we introduce a robustness test where we control for economic policy
uncertainty. We do this to consider the possibility that variance in the interest rate is
correlated with policy uncertainty, 17 or that policy uncertainty is a hidden variable driving
our estimates. We control for policy uncertainty by regressing Log(RECPI) on the log of
the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index released by Baker et al (2016), and then using
the residual of this measure as the dependent variable. Our results are virtually unchanged
and, if anything, slightly larger and more precise coefficients.
We next look at using multiple regimes. The two regimes used so far allow for a
just-identified estimate, but more regimes can allow an overidentification test. We split
our sample based on the ten-day rolling variance of Log(RECPI) into observations above
and below its mean, allowing us to create four regimes. Regime 1 has low variance for
both the T-Bill rate and RECPI, Regime 2 has high variance for both, Regime 3 has high
variance for the T-Bill but low variance for RECPI, and vice versa for Regime 4. The
summary statistics are presented in Table 7. Due to skewness in the variance of our
measures, the data is not evenly distributed across these four regimes. Regime 1 accounts
for 75% of all the data, Regime 2 for about 2%, Regime 3 for 16%, and Regime 4 for 7%.
Table 8 presents estimates replicating our approach on each of the six potential
pairs that can be created using these four regimes. The results are very consistent across
specifications. All specifications have a negative coefficient with confidence intervals
that overlap with the confidence interval of our main estimate, except for Column (7)
which is slightly more negative. Notwithstanding any small differences, the consistency
across the six estimates is considerable. We interpret this evidence to be confirmatory of
our main estimate. They suggest a level of stability in the main parameter estimated

20

across our data and confirm that entrepreneurs do respond negatively to short-term
changes in the interest rate.

C. Time Dynamics of the Impact of Interest Rates on Entrepreneurship
Our next step is to consider how our estimate of the impact of interest rate shocks varies
based on lagged or lead measures of our outcome. The goal of this analysis is two-fold.
First, we would like to assess the possibility of pre-trends in our approach. If the increase
in the interest rate is, in fact, a shock, then there should not be an anticipated
entrepreneurship response to future interest rate increases. Second, this approach also
allows us to document the dynamics of our effect, such as how quickly the negative
response in entrepreneurship becomes evident, how long it takes for this difference to
return to zero, and whether we see an overshooting later on to compensate for the initial
drop in entrepreneurship.
In Figure 4, we report coefficients of our estimate using Log(RECPI) lagged in
weekly intervals. In the pre-period, the estimates are noisy and hover around zero,
suggesting that RECPI and the interest rate shock do not have any relationship before the
shock occurs. We then observe a negative response the week following the shock, which
is greatest two weeks after the shock. This response remains negative, in both the point
estimate and in a statistically significant sense for a total of six weeks, and then returns to
zero seven weeks later. Afterwards, there is no overcompensating response to regain the
entrepreneurship lost in the prior weeks. Instead, the rate remains stable around zero up to
the end of the time period we consider. The absence of any positive compensating
response later-on suggests the loss is permanent.
We go deeper into the time dynamics in Figure 5 by plotting daily coefficients for
the period from 30 days before until 30 days after the interest rate shock. We observe,
21

once again, no pre-trend in the data, and, in fact, no contemporaneous response to
changes in the 3-month T-Bill. Rather, the effect appears to materialize five days later,
after which it reaches the lowest point estimate in day 14 and remains negative
afterwards.

D. Long Term Interest Rates and the Yield Curve
Finally, for completeness, we report in the appendix tables a replication of our approach
that instead uses long-term interest rates as the independent variable. In Table A1 and
Figures A1 through A4, we report estimates of changes in the 20-year T-Bill on
entrepreneurship, and, separately, estimates of changes in the yield curve (i.e., the
difference between the 20-year and the 3-month T-Bill) on entrepreneurship. While the
coefficients we estimate are negative and significant, our time-coefficients in this analysis
show that there are meaningful pre-trends, including an anticipated response to changes in
the interest rate. In the daily coefficients, we see that our approach of estimating the
impact of the 20-year T-Bill turns increasingly negative about fourteen days before the
interest rate shock. This is surprising and inconsistent with exogeneity. We conclude
from this analysis that our approach does not allow us to identify the impact of changes in
the 20 year rate on entrepreneurship.

VI. CONCLUSION
Understanding how variation in short-term interest rates shapes overall U.S.
entrepreneurship is an important question for both macro-finance and the microeconomic
understanding of entrepreneurship. In this paper, we used a new index of daily business
registrations created from the Startup Cartography Project and identification through
heteroskedasticity to estimate how the quantity and quality adjusted quantity of
22

entrepreneurship respond to shocks in the short-term interest rate. We find that
entrepreneurs respond negatively to interest rate shocks, with the negative response being
greater for lower quality firms. A 1 percentage point increase in the interest rate predicts
a drop of 3.2% in the flow of quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship seven days
later, and a drop of 6.4% in quantity alone. There are no pre-trends, and the gap lasts
about six weeks, after which it returns to zero. Furthermore, we do not observe any
overshooting afterward to compensate for the initial drop in entrepreneurship, which
suggests that the loss is permanent.
These results attest to the important role of liquidity constraints on
entrepreneurship. In interpreting them, however, we must include some caveats. In
particular, we focus on a specific margin of business activity that does not fully capture
the process of entrepreneurship—business registration. Using the legal filings of
companies allows us to observe the incidence of companies, up to a level of daily
granularity, at the same foundational moment for each firm (when the entrepreneurs
choose to register it). Nonetheless, it is possible that other aspects of entrepreneurship,
such as ideation or assembling a team, are not influenced by the interest rates in the same
way that the legal founding process is. The key untested assumption in our results is a
level of monotonicity between these other processes and legal registration itself.
Moreover, our measure of quality is incomplete and imperfect, and can only
partially account for the heterogeneity in firm potential at founding. A natural
conclusion of our approach is thus that the difference between the quantity estimate and
the quality-adjusted estimate represents a lower bound to the heterogeneity in responses
to interest rate shocks.
Finally, our identification approach relied on specific assumptions about the
stability of our key parameter across variance regimes. We perform a substantial number
23

of robustness tests to assess this stability within our sample, leading us to conclude that it
is stable across our time period. Still, changes in the nature of business in the past or in
the future could potentially change our underlying estimates.
Ultimately, the way in which liquidity shapes entrepreneurship is a critical
question for finance, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, but most of the work so far
has focused on sources of variation that do not reflect the interest rate changes that are
most common in the economy. In this paper, we estimated the role of changes in the
interest rates on entrepreneurship. As finance take a central role in guiding the U.S.
economic recovery from the COVID-19 induced recession, our analysis provides timely
information on how credit and monetary policy can reactivate entrepreneurship and
economic growth.

We estimate a logit model with Growth as the dependent variable. Growth is a binary
indicator equal to 1 if a firm achieves IPO or acquisition within 6 years and 0 otherwise.
Growth is only defined for firms born in the cohorts from 1988 to 2010. This model forms
the basis of our entrepreneurial quality estimates, which are the predicted values of the
model. State fixed effects included; Incidence ratios reported; Robust standard errors in

Four different variance regimes are used to assess the heteroskedasticity in the data. We divide
these regimes using the 10-day rolling variance of the 3 month T-Bill and the 10 day rolling
variance of Ln(RECPI), both above and below the mean. Coefficients in bold indicate high
variance regimes.

Dependent variable is Log(RECPI) lagged seven days forwards for all models, estimated through the heteroskedasticity approach described in Section IV. Each column
represents the estimate using two different regimes. Standard errors from 500 bootstrapped samples in parentheses.

Figure 1: Comovements in Entrepreneurship (Ln(RECPI)) and Interest Rates (3-month T-Bill Rate)

This figure shows the six-month rolling correlation between daily changes in the 3-month T-Bill Rate and daily changes
in Ln(RECPI), with respect to the standard deviation of the 3-month T-Bill Rate, from July 1988 to December 2014.

Figure 2: Simulated Response in Low and High Variance Regimes

Figure 2A shows a simulation of interest rate and RECPI in a low variance regime, where interest rate (i) is generated
from random draws of N (0,2). Figure 2B shows a simulation of interest rate and RECPI in a high variance regime,
where interest rate (i) is generated from random draws of N (0,5). In both graphs, RECPI is generated from random
draws of -0.5 i + N (0,2).

This figures shows the distributions of estimated impact of 3-month T-Bill Rate on Ln(RECPI) and Ln(Obs)
for 500 bootstrapped samples.

Figure 4: Impact of Interest Rate Shock on Entrepreneurship: Time Dynamics by Week

This figure reports the coefficient and 95-percent confidence interval of our main specification, using different lags of
Ln(RECPI) as the outcome, increasing in seven day intervals from 14 weeks before the shock to 21 weeks after.

Figure 5: Impact of Interest Rate Shock on Entrepreneurship: Daily Time Dynamics from -30 to +30 Days

This figure reports the daily coefficient and 95-percent confidence interval of our main specification, using different
lags of Ln(RECPI) as the outcome, from 30 days before to 30 days after the interest rate shock.

Heteroskedasticity columns use our preferred approach as described in Section IV. Columns (1) and (2) use the 20-year TBill Rate and columns (3) and (4) use the spread between 20-year and 3-month treasury yield as the interest rate. Standard
errors from 500 bootstrapped samples in parentheses. Dependent variables are lagged seven days forward. RECPI is our
measure of the quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship while Obs is only the quantity.

This figure reports the coefficient and 95-percent confidence interval of our main specification, using different lags of
Ln(RECPI) as the outcome and the spread between the 20-year T-Bill and 3-month treasury yield as the interest
rate; the weekly dynamic increases in seven day intervals from 14 weeks before the shock to 21 weeks after, and the
daily dynamic increases from 30 days before to 30 days after the interest rate shock.

Figure A2: Impact of Interest Rate Shock on Entrepreneurship: 20-Year-3 Month Treasury Yield Spread

This figure reports the coefficient and 95-percent confidence interval of our main specification, using different lags of
Ln(RECPI) as the outcome and the 20-year T-Bill as the interest rate; the weekly dynamic increases in seven day
intervals from 14 weeks before the shock to 21 weeks after, and the daily dynamic increases from 30 days before to
30 days after the interest rate shock.
