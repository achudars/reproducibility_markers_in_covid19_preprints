State Legislative Ideology & the Preemption of City
Ordinances: The Case of Worker Rights Laws*
Christopher B. Goodman†

University of Nebraska at Omaha

This article discusses the influence of state legislative ideology on the legislative preemption of
local ordinances in the area of worker rights. States define the powers of local governments within
their purview and states may use this power to restrict local governments from pursuing certain
policies. Using data on state legislative activity and ideology from 1993 to 2016, I find within-state
increases in legislative ideology, indicating increased legislative conservatism, associated with an
increased risk of preempting local government policy, all else equal. This finding is robust to a
number of alternate specifications and hypotheses. Ideology appears to play an important role in
the decision to involve the state in the affairs of local governments.

Introduction
In recent years, the relationship between state and local governments in the United States has
become increasingly strained. City governments, typically more liberal than their state, seek to
enact policies to satisfy city voters; however, generally more conservative state legislatures find
themselves at odds with these local ordinances and seek to prevent their implementation. This
arrangement necessarily leads to conflict, but such conflict is between unequal contestants. State
legislatures determine the basic rules of the game for local governments including what kinds of
local policies can be adopted. Local governments usually have little recourse against such state
actions, but this does not prevent them from attempting to use the judicial system as a remedy.
There are many state-specific examples of such actions. Possibly the most visible is the action
the North Carolina legislature took against a City of Charlotte ordinance banning discrimination
against LGBT individuals. In 2016, the legislature convened a special legislative session to pass a
law preventing the implementation of the City of Charlotte ordinance and preventing any additional municipalities from enacting similar laws. This preemption gained national notoriety that
ultimately lead to the repeal of both the Charlotte ordinance and the state law. Battles between
more liberally minded city government and more conservative minded state government are not
uncommon, but this example begs the question of how systematic this relationship really is. This
analysis seeks to answer this question of whether there is a systematic relationship between state
legislative ideology and the legislative preemption of local ordinances in the area of workers rights
laws using an event history framework.
While the literature on the relationship between state and local governments is voluminous,
there is limited empirical research on the state preemption of local laws. Trapenberg Frick, Weinz* Preliminary

immer, and Waddell (2015) examine the factors associated with state opposition to UN Agenda 21.
While not exactly preemption (it is unclear what potential local laws might be preempted), they
find no evidence of ideological influence in the opposition. Riverstone-Newell (2017), through a
series of case analyses, concludes that much of the recent preemption activity has been driven by
an ideological difference between progressive cities and more conservative state legislatures. Most
recently, Swanson and Barrilleaux (2018) examine court driven preemption activity and find ideological differences between cities and states to be an important factor in courts overturning local
laws; however, strong home rule powers can temper this. Ultimately, none of the recent work on
state preemption of local laws takes the issue from the legislative perspective and a quantitative
manner.
This analysis adds a number of contributions to the literature. First, it expands the nascent
literature on state preemption of local laws. The literature is currently small; however, the issue
is timely and policy relevant. There is intense media scrutiny of preemption battles; however,
the literature as it currently stands is largely unhelpful in informing these debates. Second, this
analysis is the first of its kind to directly examine the factors associated with passage of state laws
preempting local action using an event history framework (Berry and Berry 1990). This approach
brings a rich set of tools to use to analyze the issue. Finally, I focus on a specific policy area,
workers rights, that is both salient and relevant to voters on both sides of the political spectrum.
The analysis proceeds as follows. First, the previous literature on state-local relations is examined. Special attention is paid to local autonomy and how state legislatures treat local governments. Next, the data on worker rights related preemptions from Economic Policy Institute (2018),
state legislative ideology from Shor and McCarty (2011), and others are outlined and the empirical model of state preemptions of workers rights laws from 1993 to 2016 is specified. Results are
presented and a number of extensions are explored. Finally, implications are discussed.

Background

State-Local Relations in the U.S.
Local governments in the United States are constructs of their respective states. States decide the
relative level of autonomy that different forms of local government are endowed with. This relationship between state and local governments has been recognized by federal and state courts
since Judge John Dillion’s 1868 court ruling in City of Clinton v. Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad. In a series of court cases, Dillon lays out a doctrine of complete subservience of municipal
corporations to state legislatures. As Bowman and Kearney (2014, 3) explain, the strictest interpretation of Dillon’s Rule means “any doubt regarding the legality of a specific local government
power is resolved in favor of the state.” Currently, 39 states have adopted Dillion’s rule. In 31
states, Dillion’s Rule applies to all local governments and in 8 states it applies to specific jurisdictions (Richardson 2011).
Even in Dillion’s Rule states, some state legislatures have granted local governments home rule
powers that allow local areas to tailor their public policies to meet local needs without consultation with the state legislature. For a time concurrent with Judge Dillion’s ruling, there was a legal
movement to allow local government the powers of self-government, largely free of interference
from the state. Known as the Cooley Doctrine, this approach to local government autonomy has
faded as a legal doctrine once Dillion’s Rule was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court (Richardson
2011). Nonetheless, states have continued to grant limited home rule powers to their local govern2

ments. In doing so, states have not completely given up their oversight powers, but rather have
decided some areas of oversight are less important than others. Currently, 48 states grant some or
all local governments home rule powers; however, the amount of powers and local government’s
ability to access them vary highly by state.
There is a rich literature attempting to determine the exact nature of local autonomy among
the states. Given the legal and political ambiguity of home rule powers, this is no small feat. In
general, it is thought that local governments have been losing power and authority to states for
the last 40 years. Stephens (1974) outlines (and Bowman and Kearney (2011) updates) a measure of state centralization composed of three dimensions: fiscal responsibility, service delivery,
and public personnel. Each dimension measure the balance between state responsibility and local
government responsibility. The trend from 1957 until 2008 is increasing centralization among the
three dimensions; however, there is interstate variation. As Bowman (2017) notes, some states
have become considerably more centralized while others have become more decentralized. Perceptual measures of centralization also point to a loss of local autonomy (Bowman and Kearney
2012).
Given Dillion’s Rule, the granting of limited home rule powers, and changes in state centralization over time, local governments are at a disadvantage relative to the state in matters of local
policy making. This relationship necessarily leads to conflict between local governments and the
state. The changing political landscape at the state (trending more conservative) and local levels
(trending more liberal) amplify this conflict as the two sides see each other as political adversaries
(Einstein and Glick 2017). This is a marked departure from previous time periods when local
government exerted significant lobbying pressure on state legislatures (Berman 2003).

The Role of State Legislatures
As local governments are constructs of the state, state legislatures play a large role in determining
how local governance will be arranged. Historically, state legislatures have spent a large amount
of time considering issues of local affairs (Burns and Gamm 1997). Between 1871 and 1921, state
legislatures in Alabama, Massachusetts, and Michigan had numerous committees related to local
affairs and between 25 to 50 percent of legislation pertained to local issues. Burns et al. (2009)
note the prominence of legislation related to local affairs continues in state legislatures and the
importance of such legislation cannot be understated. Burns et al. (2009) go as far as contending
“local policy outcomes often occur in the state legislature.” They further find that unity among
the urban delegation with respect to “big city” bills limits conflict about such bills and allows the
urban delegation to manage the legislative process effectively. The effects of disunity among the
urban delegation can spell disaster for local specific legislation (Gamm and Kousser 2013). Larger
urban delegations often break along party lines and these cleavages can spell doom for urban
related legislation. As Gamm and Kousser (2013) explain, this process only gets worse the larger
the urban delegation is. Lovrich and Newman (2004) find legislators with prior local government
experience are more attentive to local issues in the state legislature and this previous service can
potentially moderate any disunity effects.
Bowman and Kearney (2014) describe the more recent (2011-2012 biennium) treatment of local governments in state legislatures. They find nearly 2,500 new laws pertaining to general purpose local governments (excluding school districts and special districts) with high variance among
states. These laws are classified as “empowering” or “restricting” as to give an average of statespecific legislation related to local governments. During the 2011-2012 biennium, 33 states em3

powered local governments, 12 restricted them, and in five states, empowering and restricting
legislation cancels out. Bowman (2017) notes that the legal status of local governments (Dillion’s
Rule or home rule) is not influential in the passage of empowering or restricting legislation. In
general, the prevalence of local legislation in state legislatures has been declining over the 20th
century; however, local bills still made up 20 percent of all legislation in 2000 (Gamm and Kousser
2010). While legislatures have put local affairs on the back burner, they are still active in the management of local government affairs.

Preemption of City Ordinances
What is clear from the preceding discussion is state legislatures are in control of local governments’
destinies and they have been increasingly willing to move powers away from local governments.
At the same time, residents strongly support empowering local governments to solve local problems (Schneider, Jacoby, and Lewis 2011). Among those scholars who study local autonomy, the
general consensus is, absent a compelling reason for state centralization,1 “[l]ocal decisions are
best made by locals” (Hooghe and Marks 2009, 232). Local governments generate a significant
amount of policy innovation; solving local problems with local ideas (Frug and Barron 2008). Unsurprisingly, municipal officials also feel the local level is the best place for policy decisions to be
made (DuPuis et al. 2018).
As Frug and Barron (2008) note, the current legal structure in most states affords local governments too little flexibility to effectively solve local problems. At the same time, state legislatures
do not debate local issues in a serious or nuanced manner leaving local governments in a bind.
Local governments can push forward with dubious legal authority or leave local voters’ demands
unfulfilled. In more recent years, local governments have turned to the former, adopting policies
with dubious legal authority to do so.
When a local government wanders into policy territory that a state believes is inappropriate,
the state is faced with a choice of what to do. If a state believes a local government has stepped
outside of its current legal authority and this is clearly defined in law, a state may use the courts
to enforce current rules (Swanson and Barrilleaux 2018). This method of preemption, court-driven
preemption, requires a local ordinance to be adopted to begin the process. A plaintiff may view a
local ordinance as unfair and sue to stop its enforcement; however, the courts may find such laws
to be consistent with current state law. Therefore, this method does not guarantee preemption.
The second mechanism is legislatively-driven preemption. This method of preemption requires no
specific action be taken by a local government; however, legislative preemption is often spurred
by the passage or threat of passage of a particular local ordinance. Under this method of preemption, a state legislature alters the rules of the game for local governments, reducing their legal
authority to enact local ordinances in particular area.2 More recent legislatively driven preemptions often include punitive measures against local governments should they decide to challenge
or defy a new state law (Phillips 2017; Briffault 2018). These include withholding state aid or other
financial penalties, holding local officials personally liable should they defy state law, and limiting
the avenues local governments have to legally challenge state preemptions. Legislatively-driven
preemption is the focus of this analysis.
1 Examples

include eliminating spillovers, issues of fiscal equivalence, or incompetent and/or corrupt local officials.

2 More recently, some states have turned to “blanket preemption” or “nuclear preemption” that significantly reduces

local authority on a variety of issues (Riverstone-Newell 2017; Briffault 2018). From a local autonomy perspective, it is
unclear if these actions are preemption or a fundamental restructuring of home rule powers.

4

The distinction between the two forms of state preemption of local ordinances is important.3
Court-driven preemption requires a specific local ordinance to be passed. When a state decides to
sue to block implementation of a local ordinance, it is essentially asking the courts to more specifically define the meaning of an existing state law. This action does not necessarily indicate any
partisan intent (though it might, see Swanson and Barrilleaux (2018)), but rather inconsistency
with the legal authority granted to local governments under existing law. Legislatively-driven
preemption can be viewed through a partisan lens as these preemptions are explicit actions taken
by partisan actors. In instances where legislative preemption is not a reaction to a specific local
ordinance, one might view this as entirely partisan.4 The two kinds of preemption often lead to
the same outcome, blocking of a local ordinance; however, the motivations to engage in preemption and the process by which the preemption is achieved are completely different. Examining
legislatively-driven preemption requires examining factors associated with state legislatures.
Indeed, most observers suggest the more recent legislative preemptions are conflicts between
more liberal local officials and more conservative state legislatures. Relevant to this analysis, Langan and McFarland (2017) find liberal cities are more likely to adopt city minimum wage ordinances, all else equal. Ordinances of these kind are often preempted by more conservative state
legislatures (Riverstone-Newell 2017; Phillips 2017); however, there is little empirical evidence of
this connection. The question remains why a state legislature would go the route of preempting a
local ordinance legislatively rather than through the courts. Related specifically to worker rights
legislation, corporate interests and conservative interests are often highly intertwined (HertelFernandez 2016). For instance, prominent business associations such as the National Restaurant Association (2014) and the National Retail Federation (2014) oppose increases in local, state,
and federal minimum wages; a policy position generally held by conservative legislators. These
free market policies are often packaged and distributed to more conservative state legislators via
groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (Hertel-Fernandez 2016). These organizations have had some success at influencing their
legislative members to introduce and pass legislation in their respective states consistent with the
organization’s pro-business policy preferences (Hertel-Fernandez 2014; Riverstone-Newell 2017).
If this is the case, one might expect more conservative state legislatures to be more active in preempting worker rights related local ordinances. A second potential mechanism is preemption allows more conservative state legislators to “build their reputations by exploiting symbolic issues”
(Hicks et al. 2018, 29). With few electoral repercussions for conservative state legislators, pushing
for legislative preemption is a way to signal their conservative bona fides and attract attention.5
This process of learning via national groups points to further policy diffusion related influences as potential predictors of legislative preemption. Chief among these are differences in political institutions among state legislatures (Boushey 2010). Given that ALEC often produces model
legislation for its legislative members,6 the professionalism of a state legislature is likely influential
in the preemption of local ordinances. Jansa, Hansen, and Gray (forthcoming) has found evidence
that less professional legislatures are more likely to copy from other adopters. The combination
of these two forces suggests there may be a negative relationship between professionalism and

(2018) refers to this distinction as “old” (court-driven) and “new” (legislatively-driven) preemption.
is a concept referred to as “preemptive preemption” by Phillips (2017).
5 It should be noted this works for big city (often Democratic) mayors. There is much electoral benefit to openly
defying conservative state legislatures.

preemption. That is, less professionalized legislatures may be more likely to preempt. Political
competition may also be influential on preemption activity. Reduced political competition lessens
the electoral consequences of unpopular votes. In so much as preemption is political unpopular,
lower levels of political competition at the state level could provide cover. I next turn to answering
the empirical question of whether more conservative state legislatures are more active in legislatively preempting local worker rights ordinances.

Data & Empirical Strategy

Data
Data on state preemption of local ordinances is difficult to track. As of yet, there is no centralized
repository of information on state preemption activity. The National League of Cities provides
likely the most comprehensive database of preemption activity (DuPuis et al. 2018); however, the
data as reported are too limited to build a cross-sectional, time-series dataset. Swindell, Svara,
and Stenberg (2018) and Swindell, Stenberg, and Svara (2017) maintain a similar dataset, but it
is not public. In order to facilitate analysis, information on legislative preemptions in five policy
areas related to workers rights are selected. These data are compiled and tracked by the Economic
Policy Institute (2018). In each case, a preemption is registered if a state passes a law limiting the
implementation of any of the five policies. The five polices include minimum wage, fair scheduling, project labor agreements, prevailing wage, and paid leave. The primary dependent variable
for this analysis is any preemption of any kind over the time period, 1993 to 2016. As such, this
is a dichotomous variable indicating zero if there are no preemptions in a given year and one if
there are any in a given year.7 The geographic distribution of these data can be seen in Figure 1.
There are numerous states who have yet to legislatively preempt any of the five policies; however,
there is variation with two states (Kansas, Michigan) over the 23 year time period preempting all
five. As can be seen in Figure 2 and Table 1, preemption of local minimum wage ordinances is
the most prevalent and consistent over time; however, the other four types have become common
in recent years. Legislatively-driven preemption of local paid leave ordinances lead this group of
recent legislation.8
Until relatively recently, data on state legislative ideology was severely lacking. The most
popular method of assessing government ideology was the method outline in Berry et al. (1998).
This method weights average state party proportions and multiplies them by state delegation congressional ideology. This translation is imperfect as congressional ideology does not necessarily
translate to state legislative ideology. This issue is remedied by the work of Shor and McCarty
(2011). They provide state legislator ideal points based on state legislative roll call voting and the
Project Vote Smart National Political Awareness Test (NPAT). The data are available for years 1993
to 2016. This analysis uses aggregations of the individual ideal points as the preferred measure of
7 This necessarily limits variation in the preemption activity of a state.

Theoretically, a state may have as many as five
preemptions in a given year. This approach is nearly identical to the pooled components analysis in Boehmke (2009),
allowing to repeat adoption of similar components. Relaxing this restriction to examine the count of adoptions in any
given state-year is explored in a later section.
8 There is some indications this spat of paid leave preemptions is tied to Wisconsin Bill 23, passed in 2011, to preempt
the City of Milwaukee’s local paid leave ordinance passed by local referendum in 2008. The text of this legislation was
distributed by ALEC (though it was never officially part of the groups’ model legislation) and may have been adopted,
in part, by numerous other states (Grabar 2016).

state legislative ideology. Specifically, the median ideal point for each legislative chamber majority party is used as the measure of legislative ideology.9 Shor and McCarty’s ideology measure is
centered on zero with scores below signifying more liberal majorities and scores above zero indicating more conservative majorities. As is seen in Table 1, legislative majorities in both chambers
have a slight conservative tilt, but there is much variation around the mean. Figure 2 plots legislative ideology, averaged across 49 state houses, across time. Average majority ideology becomes
sharply more conservative in the aftermath of the 1994 Republican Revolution and again in the
aftermath of the 2010 election cycle. Mapped on top of legislative preemption activity, the rise of
conservative dominated legislatures tracks well with preemption activity, particularly in the latter
time periods. Naturally, this visual relationship does not demonstrate a statistical relationship.

Of course, state legislative ideology is not the only likely predictor of legislative preemption
activity in the area of worker’s rights. From the policy diffusion literature (Boushey 2010), there
are a number of political institutions that are likely important. First is state legislative professionalism. As Jansa, Hansen, and Gray (forthcoming) note, less professional legislatures are more likely
to “copy and paste” legislation from other sources. Given that preemption legislation may diffuse
from organizations like ALEC, professionalism may be an important predictor. If this is indeed
the case, one expects increased professionalism to be a negative predictor of legislative preemption
activity. Professionalism is operationalized using Squire’s index of legislative professionalism. It
is interpreted as state legislative professionalism relative to congressional professionalism (Squire
1992, 2000, 2007, 2012, 2017). On average, professionalism is low at approximately 20 percent of
congressional professionalism. The second institution is political competition. If state legislative
races are reasonable competitive, legislators may perceive there to be an electoral cost for contentious votes. This could limit preemption activity. Political competition is operationalized using
a folded Ranney index as calculated in Bibby and Holbrook (2004) with a four year moving average.10 A value of 0.50 indicates complete one party control and as the index approaches one,
political competition increases. On average, the index takes on a value of 0.85 indicating a reasonable amount of competition; however, the mean value hides a reduction of average competition
and an increase in the variation over the time period.
folded Ranney index is calculated as 1 − |0.5 − Ranney Index|. Longer moving averages (6 year and 10 year)
were tested and there is no appreciable difference in results.

In addition to political institutions, there are a number of control variables. Population is included to control for the size of state. Personal income per capita is included to control for potential wealth effects. Two variables are included to control for the size and/or prevalence of urban
populations. The first is population density. The second is the percentage of the state population
living in urban areas (as defined as living in a metropolitan county). These two variable are similar, but measure different concepts. Density measures the prevalence of urban areas in a state. As
average density increases, more of the physical landscape of the state is urban. Urban population
measures how much of the state population lives in these areas. Rural states typically have low
average density but a high percentage urban residents. Given the discussion above about the importance (or lack thereof) of urban legislative delegations, these two variables provide important
controls for the ability of state legislators representing cities to fend off preemption.
A number of variables are included to control for various characteristics of state residents.
First, both the percentage of residents who are under the age of 19 and over the age of 65 are included. The prevalence of such residents may shift legislator’s time away from issues of workers
and toward issues of youth or the elderly. The percentage of the state’s population with 16+ years
of education is included to control for educational endowments. Racial heterogeneity of the population is included. This is operationalized following Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly (1999) as the
probability that two randomly drawn individuals belong to two different ethnic groups.11 Union
membership density is an important control for the power of relevant interest groups. Many of the
policy issues potentially preempted are of importance to union members and unions may exert
lobbying pressure to prevent their preemption. The variable is supplied by Hirsch and Macpherson (2003) and is extracted from the Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic
Supplement. Lastly, following Boehmke (2009), the regressions to follow are conditioned on the
number of worker rights related preemptions a state has already adopted. It is unclear whether
prior experience with preemption increases the likelihood of preemption in the future or reduces
it.
The main data sources for this analysis are the Economic Policy Institute (2018) enumerations
of preemptions and state legislative ideology data from Shor and McCarty (2011). These are supplemented by Squire, Census Bureau estimates, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
program at the Centers for Disease Control, and the Regional Economic Information System at the
Bureau of Economic Analysis. On the first cut, Nebraska is eliminated from the dataset due to its
unicameral legislature. A further twenty states are eliminated because they have no preemption
activity over the 1993 to 2016 time period. This is necessitated by the maximum likelihood estimation technique outlined below. This data reduction method leaves a final analytical dataset of
592 observations from 29 states. Data sources and summary statistics for all of the variables are
reported in Table 1.

Empirical Strategy
Event history analyses have a long and rich history in the political science literature (Berry and
Berry 1990). The standard methodology involves specifying the dependent variable as dichotomous [0,1] and regressing using logit or probit. Given the cross sectional, time series nature of the
11 Ethnic fragmentation is calculated as follows: ETHN IC = 1 −
∑i ( RACEi )2 where Racei denotes the share of
population for race i where i = {white, black, Native American, and Asian}. See Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly (1999) for
further explanation of the construction of this variable and Vigdor (2002) for a theoretical perspective.

data, unit specific fixed effects are necessary to control for any time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity (Green, Kim, and Yoon 2001). In doing so, the baseline rate of adoption is allowed to vary
by state (Boehmke 2009); something that is likely important given that some local policies (minimum wage or paid leave) are preempted by a great many states while others (fair scheduling) are
not.12 The methods typically used are thought to suffer from an incidental parameters problem
(Neyman and Scott 1948). Rather than rely on a single estimation technique, a varied approach
is used. Following the advice of Beck (2015) for the estimation of binary dependent variables
with fixed effects, a linear probability model with state and year fixed effects is used (Angrist
2001), conditional logit (Chamberlain 1980), and logit with state fixed effects.13 The results from
the three estimation techniques will be used to corroborate the findings across models. To aid in
comparison between the three techniques, I constrain the OLS sample to those states that exhibit
some time series variation. As Beck (2015) explains, not doing so likely biases the β coefficient
toward zero as the marginal effects of this ”ALL0” group are zero. This procedure eliminates 20
states from the dataset.14 The OLS and logit techniques allow for the recovery of marginal effects;
however, the conditional logit does not.
12 This

is a departure from a large portion of the event history or policy diffusion literature that tends to estimate
these models using pooled analyses (Shipan and Volden 2008). Given the primary hypothesis of this analysis is that
within-state increases in conservatism is a correlate of preemption activity, a fixed effects approach is necessary.
13 The latter is estimated in Stata using the logitfe command and the analytical corrected estimator. Average partial
effects are displayed throughout.
14 The OLS results presented in table 2 are qualitatively robust to the inclusion of all states. As Beck (2015) predicts,
the effect size on the two primary variables of interest are biased downward. The effect size of state senate majority
median is lower by roughly 0.02 units and statistically significant at the 0.01 level. The effect size on state house majority
median is halved and statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

Results
Table 2 shows the results of three regression or logit models where the dependent variable is
binary, indicating one if a state had a legislative preemption of any kind in a given year. The
first specification in estimated using OLS. The second specification is estimated using conditional
logit and the third specification is estimated using fixed effects logit. Across all three specifications, both upper and lower house majority ideology variables are positive suggesting increasing
within-state conservatism in either chamber is associated with higher risk of preemption in any
given year. While the results are generally consistent (models 1 and 3 are directly comparable as
marginal effects), the results are fairly fragile with only house majority ideology rising to the level
of 95 percent significance across all three specifications. The marginal effects between models 1
and 3 are quite similar with an increase of 1 unit in house ideology (neutral (0) to conservative (1))
associated with a 5 to 6 percent increase in the risk of preemption. In specification one, senate majorities rise to the level of statistically significance with a one unit increase in ideology associated
with a 6.5 percent increase in the risk of preemption. Taken as a pair, house and senate majority
ideology are jointly different than zero.
Legislative professionalism exerts no statistical influence on the risk of preemption and political competition exerts a statistically inconsistent yet negative influence on the risk of preemption.
This result is intriguing as previous work on the policy diffusion has found these factors to be
influential on the receptivity of states to adopting policy innovations (Boushey 2010). It is possible the overtly conservative nature of the groups developing and diffusing the model legislation
many of these preemptions are based minimizes the influence of these institutions. The results
suggest that state legislatures that are more electorally competitive see a lower risk of preemption;
potentially indicating there is an electoral risk to preemption in this policy area. However, this
finding is not supported by all specifications, reducing confidence in the finding. The remaining
control variables are largely not influential on preemption activity. Population exerts a negative
influence suggesting that larger states are less willing to preempt local government actions. Increased ethnic heterogeneity is associated with high probability of preemption. This result may
signal a legislature’s willingness to preempt the policies of more diverse urban areas; however,
this particular variable is too crude of a measure to answer that exact question. Lastly, previous
experience with preemption reduces the risk of future preemption.

Extensions
The results presented in the previous section provide evidence of a link between increasingly
conservative state legislatures and legislative preemption activity in the realm of worker rights
policies. This section tests a number of extensions to this analysis and explores the sensitivity of
the results to alternative specifications. First, examining state legislative ideology from the perspective of the majority party eliminates the possibility of bipartisan preemption activity. This is
explored by re-specifying the models presented in Table 2 using upper and lower chamber ideology rather than majority ideology. Second, state legislative chambers do not make law in isolation.
It is possible the combination of upper and lower house ideology is what is truly important. Following Shor and McCarty (2011), upper and lower house ideology are averaged and the original
models re-estimated. Third, the influence of both legislative ideology and gubernatorial ideology
is examined. Since a successful preemption requires action from three bodies, the alignment of

ideology across all three may be the most important. This is accomplished by interacting averaged legislative majority ideology with gubernatorial ideology (CFscore) from the Database on
Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME) (Bonica 2015). Fourth, two specific and visible
preemptions, minimum wage and paid leave, are estimated separately to disentangle any effects
masked by their combination. Lastly, the restriction on only one preemption per year is relaxed.
A number of states pass multiple preemptions per year and this last set of models explores this
additional variation.
The following section examines each of these potentialities in turn. The point is not to dispute
the previous results, but rather to demonstrate the durability of findings that increased conservative legislative ideology is driving legislative preemption activity. To conserve space, key coefficients are reported in Table 3 and 4, but the remaining control variables are suppressed.15 In most
instances, the control variables are the same as those that appear in Table 2. Full negative binomial
regression results are presented in Table 5.

Chamber Ideology
The results presented in Table 2 relates majority party ideology to preemption activity. This relationship eliminates the possibility for bipartisan preemption. It is entirely possible that more
conservative chambers rather than majority parties are preempting local ordinances. This potentiality is explored in Panel A of Table 3. As can be seen, the results are uniformly positive, but
significantly more fragile than the findings from Table 2. Combined with the previous results, it is
unclear that which chambers ideology is the most important. A one unit increase in senate chamber ideology is associated with a 20 percent increase in the probability of a preemption. The effect
size is significantly larger than any of the results in Table 2 suggesting more conservative members
of the minority party may join with the majority party to increase the probability of preemption.

Combined Ideology
Legislative chambers do not make law in isolation. Legislation passed in one chamber requires
passage in the other plus a gubernatorial signature. This relationship suggests the combined or
averaged ideology of the legislative body may be the more important measure of ideology. This
is explored in Panel B of Table 3. Following Shor and McCarty (2011), median upper and lower
chamber majority and upper and lower chamber ideology scores are averaged to provide a single,
composite measure of legislative majority and chamber ideology. These composite measures iare
entered into the same models presented in Table 2.
As can be seen in Panel B of Table 3, both majority and chamber ideology are positively associated with the probability of legislative preemption. The same relative size difference in effect
size between majority party and chamber ideology from the previous section is preserved. A one
unit increase in majority ideology is associated with a ten percent increase in the probability of
preemption. This same increase in chamber ideology is associated than an effect size roughly one
and a half to two times the size of the averaged majority median. These results reinforce the prior
findings that conservative ideology driving preemption activity.
15 For

specific exemptions presented in table 4, the previous preemptions variable is dropped from the estimation.

Gubernatorial Ideology
It may be the case that the results presented thus far are simply reflecting the choice of governors
to sign preemption legislation. While more conservative state legislatures may produce more preemption legislation, enactment of such legislation requires a gubernatorial signature (or veto override). Indeed, there are recent examples of governors vetoing preemption legislation in the realm
of worker rights. Governor Mark Dayton (MN, D) vetoed 2017 legislation to preemption Minnesota cities from adopting city ordinance pertaining to paid time off or minimum wage (StassenBerger 2017). Governors may serve as important gatekeepers, preventing or allowing preemption
to proceed in line with their personal ideologies.
If the correlation between legislative ideology and probability of preemption is merely a byproduct of more conservative governors choosing to sign preemption legislation, controlling for gubernatorial ideology should cause legislative ideology to become statistically insignificant. To examine this, I introduce a new variable, winning gubernatorial candidate CFscore from the DIME data
(Bonica 2013, 2015) and interact it with averaged state majority medians. These data do not cover
the entire period of the analysis presented in Table 2 or 3 rather they cover the time period from
1994 to 2014. Therefore, these are not directly comparable to the other results, but serve as a useful check for alternative hypotheses. As can be seen in Panel C of Table 3, the point estimates
for averaged state majority medians are roughly similar to the analogous point estimates from
Panel B. Importantly, across two of the three estimation techniques, the statistical significance of
the primary effect is largely preserved. Gubernatorial CFscore and its interaction is only statistically significant in the OLS specification. The results from the OLS specification suggest that in
states with more liberal governors, the risk of preemption is reduced for both liberal legislative
majorities and conservative majorities. Most applicable to this analysis, more liberal governors

14

may temper the effect of ideologically conservative state legislatures on preemption activity. It
should be noted that this result is fragile and not supported by the two other specifications.

Minimum Wage & Paid Leave
The analysis to this point has examined all preemptions; however, this is a combination of five
discrete policies. Table 4 disaggregates two politically salient targets of legislative preemption,
local minimum wage ordinances and local paid leave ordinances, and re-estimates all models
to this point. What is clear from Table 4 is ideology has little influence on paid leave preemption.
Regardless of how ideology is operationalized, there is no statistical relationship between ideology
paid leave preemption.16 Therefore, within-state increases in ideology (i.e. rising conservatism)
are unlikely to be the source of legislative preemptions of local paid leave ordinances.
Turning next to legislative preemptions of local minimum wage ordinances, the association
between ideology and preemption is positive. However, the results by legislative chamber are
somewhat unreliable. The results are more consistent for combined ideology with both averaged
majority and averaged chamber ideology positively associated with preemption. These results are
somewhat smaller than the combined results presented in Table 3, but this is to be expected as the
number of preemptions being predicted is smaller.

Count Models
The final extension is to relax the aggregation of all preemptions into a single dichotomous variable. Rather than indicating any preemption in a given year, the number of preemptions by stateyear is the dependent variable. Doing so requires altering the estimation technique. The count

nature of the dependent variable suggests uses negative binomial regression; however, the inclusion of conditional fixed effects is difficult.17 Allison and Waterman (2002) suggest including a
j − 1 series of state dummy variables and using outer product of gradient standard errors is a
good approximation of conditional fixed effects.18 Given the structure of the data (see Table 1),
one might expect a zero-inflated model to be appropriate. A Vuong test was conducted for each
model in Table 5 and there is little evidence to suggest a zero-inflated model performs better than
a normal negative binomial regression.
Table 5 shows the results of four negative binomial regression models where the dependent
variable is the count of legislative preemptions of any kind in a given year. The first specification included house and senate majority ideology and the second model include house and
senate chamber ideology. In both models, neither variable rises to the level of statistical significance. Moving to specification three, includes combined majority ideology and is positively and
statistically significant predictor of the count of legislative preemptions. Negative binomial coefficients may be viewed as semielasticities; therefore, a one unit increase in averaged state majority
ideology is associated with 310 percent more preemptions, all else equal.19 Given this median
number of preemptions is zero, this large coefficient makes some sense. The effect size of fourth
specification is not quite double that of the third. Taken together, increasingly conservative state
legislatures are associated with an increase in the count of legislative preemptions. Similar to the
primary results in Table 2, political institutions variables as well of the controls are not influential
on preemption activity.

Discussion & Conclusions
The intent of this analysis is to examine the relationship between state legislative ideology and
the legislative preemption of local ordinances in the realm of worker rights policy. Using data
from the Economic Policy Institute on five policies, minimum wage, fair scheduling, project labor
agreements, prevailing wage, and paid leave, a state fixed-effects event history analysis is conducted with legislative ideology as the primary regressor. Through multiple regression models,
an association between within state increases in legislative conservatism and preemption activity
is found. Combined ideology, the average of lower and upper house median ideology, is the most
consistently important measure of ideology across all models. Few other factors appear to influential. The results appear to conform to the popular narrative of more ideologically conservative
state legislatures preempt policies of more ideologically liberal city governments. The findings
here add to the recent work by Swanson and Barrilleaux (2018) who find a similar result with
respect to court-driven preemption. Ideology appears to play an important role in the decision to
involve the state in the affairs of local governments in recent decades.
A unique aspect of this analysis, the focus on legislatively-driven preemptions, is also a limitation. Because no specific local ordinance is required for legislative preemption activity to begin,
it is difficult to accurately measure the ideological distance between state legislators and local
officials. Should it be possible to measure, it is unclear which ideological distance would be important: state to central city, state to all cities, state to some cities? Swanson and Barrilleaux (2018)
17 Fixed-effects

poisson regression is also an option; however, the LR test from Table 5 suggests over-dispersion is a
problem for all four models. Therefore, the estimation continues with negative binomial regression.
18 This is easily implemented in Stata using the nbreg command with the vce(ogp) option.
19 The incident rate ratio, e β is 22.3 suggesting relative to a state with a legislative ideology of 0, a state with a legislative ideology of 1 will have 22.3 times the incident rate of preemptions.

have a precise answer by focusing on court-driven preemption. The ideological distance between
the state and the specific city being sued is important. In some legislative preemptions, no local
ordinance was proposed or passed making the potential difference in state-local ideology moot.
Others are a response to specific passed or proposed ordinances making the ideological distance
between state and specific city important. The analysis presented here cannot disentangle this
issue. A second limitation of this study is the relatively narrow, policy specific nature of the
preemption data. The limited nature of the preemption data is partially out of necessity. State
legislatures consider hundreds, if not thousands, of bills pertinent to local governments per year
(Bowman and Kearney 2014; Gamm and Kousser 2010). Correctly identifying which of these are
preemption related may be an impossible task. By reducing the scope to five specific policies, an
accurate count can be established. Future research should attempt to identify a larger population
of past preemptions and establish a method of tracking new ones.
Local governments rely on their relative autonomy to provide local solutions to local problems.
States are well within their powers to adjust the level of autonomy provided to local governments;
however, some stability in autonomy is required. If, as the results of this analysis suggest, more
conservative state legislative ideology is an important predictor of preemption activity, it is entirely possible for these preemptions to be undone with changes in ideology. If local autonomy
begins to change with state election cycles, local elected officials and administrators will have
a difficult time planning for future events. Local government provide public services that, by
their nature, require stability; services like police and fire departments, public parks, and schools.
Related specifically to this analysis, local ordinances related to worker rights require local businesses to make changes to accommodate new regulations. Uncertainty over whether local business regulations will change could significantly alter business decisions and ultimately harm local
economies.
As Figure 2 shows, preemption activity in the realm of worker rights laws has been accelerating
over time. It is reasonable to assume preemptions in other policy areas have been accelerating as
well; however, we do not have as good of data in other policy arenas. Future research should
address a number of issues. First, this research should be expanded to include more policy areas.
Given the visibility and salience of worker rights related preemptions, it is possible these findings
are contained only to this policy area. Observing more preemptions and more varied preemptions
will allow scholars to make this determination. Second, the relationship between preemption
activity, regardless of kind, and local autonomy is relatively unexplored. It is clear preemption
alters local autonomy, but it is unclear how much preemption reduces local autonomy or how this
reduction should be reflected in relevant data on local autonomy. Sorting through these two issues
in the research will enhance our ability to identify/track preemptions and examine the effects of
preemption on local governments.
