ABSTRACT
Cognitive ability is one of the most potent and contentious human traits. Many issues
surrounding cognitive ability especially those related to heredity is highly charged. Yet, all of the
discussion on heredity has been based on non-DNA evidence. It is largely neglected that DNA
and environmental data at individual level are indispensable for understanding the development
of cognitive ability. In this article, we report findings from a study that uses both ability-related
polygenic scores (PGSs) and a rich set of socioeconomic measures from Add Health. In an allethnicity sample excluding blacks, a social-science model predicts verbal ability well yielding an
R2 of 17.5%. Adding two ability-related PGSs increases this R2 by 1.7%. Such models yield
more accurate estimates of the effects of the PGSs and those of SES context, and provide an
estimated degree to which SES context is influenced by parental genomes. Schooling and
neighborhood remain important to verbal ability even after an early measure of verbal ability is
adjusted in the model. Although the influence from the genome is evident, the influences of SES
context are critical and cannot be dismissed.

INTRODUCTION
Cognitive ability is one of the most potent human traits. It is potent for at least three
reasons. Arguably, cognitive ability is the hallmark of humans that separates them from the
other species in the natural world. It is ubiquitous and vital for basic subsistence in deep human
history and for contemporary physical and economic well-being. Evidence suggests that more
than an inconsequential portion of ability is related to heredity (Bouchard 1998; Bouchard and
McGue 1981). Cognitive ability is as controversial as it is potent. Many issues surrounding
cognitive ability especially those related to heredity is highly charged (e.g., Fischer et al. 1996;
Herrnstein and Murray 1994; Jensen 1969). Yet, all of the empirical analysis concerning
heredity has been based on non-DNA data. It is largely neglected that DNA evidence in
combination with socioeconomic (SES) contextual information at individual level is
indispensable for understanding how heredity and SES context jointly and interactively mold
human cognitive ability. Such DNA evidence just became available recently (Lee et al. 2018;
Okbay et al. 2016; Savage et al. 2018; Sniekers et al. 2017).
Understanding the roots of cognitive ability is relevant and important. Cognitive ability
has been shown to be one of the best predictors of life outcomes such as educational
attainment, occupation achievement, income, wealth, and health (e.g., Farkas et al. 1997;
Farkas and Vicknair 1996; Jencks et al. 1979; Taubman and Wales 1974; Taubman and Wales
1972; Wraw et al. 2015). Cognitive ability remains important even with the evidence that its
predictive power for later life outcomes tends to be markedly reduced once educational
attainment is adjusted. This is so because cognitive ability is a key predictor of academic
performance in school as well as educational attainment itself and because it exerts an effect on
labor market outcomes independently from educational attainment (Jencks et al. 1979;
Kerckhoff, Raudenbush and Glennie 2001; Rosenbaum 2001; Spilerman and Lunde 1991).
Tests of cognitive ability and related cognitive achievement are routinely and nearly universally

1

used in elementary and secondary education, college admissions, and admissions of graduate
schools and professional schools in the United States (Hauser 2010; Lemann 1999).
Views differ enormously regarding what gives rise to cognitive ability. At the heart of the
matter is how much weight should be placed on inheritance relative to after-birth learning. One
long-standing and influential position considered it an “…inborn, all around intellectual ability …
inherited, but not due to teaching or training .. uninfluenced by industry or zeal. (Burt et al. 1934,
cited by RE Nisbett 2009).” Jensen maintained that “… the means for changing intelligence per
se lie in the province of biology rather than psychology or education (1969).” Herrnstein and
Murray (1994) expressed a similar assessment that the differences in intelligence were mostly
at the hand of nature and there was little that government policies could change. As Nisbett
(2009, p.36) pointed out, many prominent scholars believed that family environments have
essentially nil effects, including JR Harris (1998), Steven Pinker (2002), and Levitt and Dubner
(2006, p.157). In a 2018 interview with BBC World News HARDtalk, Plomin (2018) claimed that
“(W)ith the exception of being in an abusive environment …, the people (including schools and
jobs) who raised an individual would make little difference.”
Diametrically opposite to Arthur Jensen was the view of Claude Fischer and colleagues
(e.g., 1996). They regarded a cognitive test such as the Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT) as a test of academic performance from school learning, which was heavily influenced
by SES context. Positioned between the two extremes are those who considered cognitive
ability a composite outcome that was shaped by both natural endowment and environmental
conditions (e.g., Jencks et al. 1979; Scullin et al. 2000; Winship and Korenman 1997).
Regardless of their position on the role of heritance for cognitive ability, a fundamental
weakness in all previous work is the lack of DNA data or data measured at the molecular level.
As a substitute, biometric studies based on genetic relatedness of twins and sibling were used
to estimate the heritability of cognitive ability. Heritability is the proportion of the total variance in
a trait due to genetic factors. Under an array of assumptions that are difficult or impossible to
2

satisfy (e.g., Nisbett 2009, Chapter 2), biometric analysis estimates the level of importance of
unidentified genetic factors relative to that of non-genetic factors in a trait. It cannot estimate the
effects of genotype side by side with the effects of SES context. Biometric studies yielded a
heritability estimate that ranges between 0.2 to 0.8 (e.g., Bouchard 1998; Velden 1997) and a
shared non-genetic influence that quickly reduces to zero after childhood (Bouchard 1998;
Jensen 1997).
The policy arguments such as those made by Jensen (1969) and Herrnstein and Murray
(1994) were based on a loose extrapolation of these biometric estimates. Persuasive evidence
for policy arguments regarding individuals must be based on necessary genotype and socialcontextual data at individual level. Such analysis cannot be carried out when only biometric data
are available. Without such empirical work linking genotype to cognitive ability at individual level,
heritability estimates can be easily loosely and incorrectly interpreted.
With the advent of DNA data and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on
outcomes closely related to cognitive ability, analysis becomes feasible that explicitly
incorporates genomic measures. In this article, we report findings from a study that investigates
how human genome and environment, especially SES context, jointly and interactively shape
verbal intelligence.
BACKGROUND
Cognitive Ability and Life Outcomes
Cognitive ability has a strong positive association with academic performance in school.
Examining six longitudinal studies, Jencks et al. (1979, p.102) concluded that the correlational
association between the two ranged from 0.40 to 0.63. Using a large, nationally representative
and prospective data source of more than 70,000 British students, Deary et al. (2007) showed
that cognitive ability measured at 11 years old was a strong predictor of school achievement
measured by national examinations on 25 subjects at 16 years old.

3

The positive association between cognitive ability and educational attainment is also
evident. In a study that assembled eight large datasets including several massive state-wide
datasets in the United States, Taubman and Wales (1972, p 20) reported a strong positive
association between cognitive ability and continuing to college. While about 40-50% of the high
school graduates at the 50th percentile of an ability test continued to college, the percentage
continuing to college at the 90th percentile reached 80-90% in late 1950s and 1960s when the
U.S. higher education expanded. Data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) showed a
positive association between an ability test score and length of schooling (Hauser 2010, p103).
The effect of cognitive ability on later life outcomes becomes complicated when the role
of education is taken into consideration. Drawing data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Youth (NLSY), Scullin et al. (2000) investigated the predictive power of AFQT administered
when the respondents were 15 to 17 years old, together with educational attainment and race.
They reported that although AFQT was predictive of labor market outcomes such as personal
incomes, hourly wage, and occupational socioeconomic index (SEI), the predictive powers were
substantially reduced when years of schooling was added to the models. The analysis by
ethnicity showed that cognitive ability had a much smaller effect and educational attainment had
a much larger effect for African Americans than for white Americans. Examining about 10,000
Wisconsin high school students followed since their graduation in 1957, Hauser (2010)
concluded that the associations of cognitive ability with job performance, occupational prestige,
income, and wealth largely disappeared once levels of schooling were adjusted.
The relationship between ability and personal health resembles that between ability and
labor market outcomes. When family SES is adjusted and self educational attainment is not
adjusted, ability proved to be a strong predictor of general health conditions. A 50-year Scottish
longitudinal study on more than 27,000 adults reported that low cognitive ability at 11 years old
was strongly associated with higher mortality before age 65 after adjusting for social class and
deprivation category (Gruer, Hart and Watt 2017). Using the NLSY-79, Wraw et al. (2015)
4

showed that AFQT was predictive of an array of health indicators measured at age 50 including
three overall measures of general health, nine measures of diagnosed illness conditions, and
two measures of self-reported conditions after family SES in childhood was adjusted. Once the
respondents’ own SES in adulthood including education, income and occupation were adjusted,
ability remained a significant predictor for the three overall measures of general health, but for
many specific illness conditions, the effects sizes were reduced markedly.
SES and Other Environmental Roots of Cognitive Ability
A body of evidence exists for the importance of SES context for cognitive ability. Among
social-contextual factors, formal schooling is commonly viewed as the most direct and essential
determinant of cognitive ability. Tests of cognitive ability are hardly meaningful out of the context
of modern education. Dutch children’s schooling was delayed by the Nazi regime during WWII
and these children’s IQ were seven points lower on average than those who went to school at
regular ages after the war (DeGroot 1948; Nisbett 2009, p.41). In a longitudinal study of the
effects of family SES, racial mix, and summer breaks on children’s mathematics achievement,
Entwisle and Alexander (1992) concluded that “when school is in session, poor children and
better-off children perform at almost the same level. Schools seem to be doing a better job than
they have been given credit for (pp.82.)” They demonstrated the effect of schooling by showing
the loss in mathematics scores after every summer break on the part of children in poverty
relative to children not in poverty.
Through a natural experiment, Cahan and Cohen (1989) reported a schooling effect
distinct from the effect of biological age on an IQ test score that included measurement of fluid
intelligence. The study compared fourth graders and fifth graders who were essentially of the
same age. Winship and Korenman (1997) reviewed the literature that estimated the effect of
education on cognitive ability and carefully reanalyzed the NLSY data used by Herrnstein and
Murray (1994). They concluded that each year of education increased 2.7 points of IQ units.
Estimating the effect of education on cognitive ability is challenging because the two are
5

intertwined. While academic training in school contributes to cognitive ability, cognitive ability is
also related to how fast and efficiently academic subjects are absorbed and to eventual
educational attainment. In this project, we estimated the effect of education on verbal ability
measured at Wave 3 in Add Health after controlling for the exact same version of verbal ability
administered at Wave 1. A similar strategy was used when estimating the effect of education on
cognitive ability in the absence of DNA data (Winship and Korenman 1997, p 220).
Socioeconomic status is a composite concept with multiple dimensions that comprises
family financial resources, knowledge, social connections, and the larger social context. SES is
typically measured by parental income, education and occupation, one vs two biological parents
in the household, sibship size, quality of neighborhood, and quality of school (e.g., Braveman et
al. 2005; Link and Phelan 1996). In a meta-analysis of adoption studies of IQ, Locurto (1990)
showed that adoption into high SES families raised the adopted children’s IQ by 10-12 points.
These adoptive children tended to come from low SES families. Entwisle and Alexander (1992)
concluded that family SES status had a larger impact than the interruption of schooling from
summer breaks on cognitive test scores in the context of elementary education.
Mechanism studies explained why SES context makes a difference in cognitive test
scores. Guo and Harris (2000) investigated the mechanisms through which family SES affected
children’s cognitive ability. Using data from the NLSY, they showed that the effect of family SES
was completely mediated by the intervening mechanisms measured by the latent factors of
cognitive stimulation in home, home physical environment, parenting style, and child health at
birth. Cognitive ability in that study was measured by four Peabody tests including a reading
recognition test, a reading comprehension test, and a mathematics assessment test, and PPVT.
Hart and Risley (1995) observed children in 42 families for one hour per week for two and a half
years and their calculation suggested that large differences existed in the total number of words
heard by children from birth to age four across professional families (45 millions), working class
families (25 millions), and families in poverty (13 millions). Using the children of the NLSY79,
6

Farkas and Beron (2004) showed that by 36-month of age, large gaps in vocabulary already
emerged across social classes and racial/ethnic groups, and the gaps were not closed
afterwards.
Macro historical trend of intelligence tests provides another source of evidence for
environmental influences on cognitive ability. The well-known Flynn effect documented the
historical rise in intelligence scores (e.g., Flynn 1987). The rise was interpreted as a result from
a societal change that placed a greater value on rational reasoning in more recent time (Flynn
2007) as well as general improvements in education, nutrition and health (Flynn 2009).
Researchers have long examined the connections between problem behaviors and
academic potential (e.g., Hinshaw 1992; Kessler et al. 1995; Malinauskiene et al. 2011; McLeod
and Kaiser 2004). Our full models also tested the effects of binge drinking, marijuana use,
smoking, and serious delinquency.
Genomic Roots of Cognitive Ability
For decades, the genomic influences on cognitive ability were estimated via biometric
studies. The estimated heritability has a vast range, depending on factors including sample size,
the environment associated with the particular population from which the analysis sample is
drawn, non-additive genetic variance, the assumptions of assortative mating and equal
environment, and whether the data are based on a single genetic-relatedness such as adoptiveapart data or more than one genetic-relatedness such as the classic twin data (e.g., Bouchard
and McGue 1981; Plomin and Loehlin 1989; Velden 1997). Heritability estimates, however,
cannot be used to investigate the effects of environmental and genomic roots at the individual
level.
The efforts linking DNA variation to cognitive ability began in earnest in the early 2000.
By then, it was evident that intelligence was a complex trait subject to the influences of a large
number of genes each with a tiny effect (Glazier, Nadeau and Aitman 2002). The challenge to
find specific genes for cognitive ability was enormous. A human genome consists of millions of
7

genetic variants. Testing whether each one of them predicts ability and setting the critical value
for significance at the level of 0.05 would by chance generate a huge number of false positive
findings. Although the genome is large, it is finite. The solution was to set a stringent critical
value of 5x10-8 for significance and to request a replication of a discovered genetic variant in an
independent data source. Initial successes of these genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
employing several thousands of individuals were performed on human traits such as type 2
diabetes and body mass index (BMI) (Frayling et al. 2007; Zeggini et al. 2007). The number of
GWAS-identified genetic loci were small, but tended to be replicated.
It soon became clear that by far the single most important factor in GWAS was sample
size. The most readily available large samples were for anthropometric measures such as
human height and body mass index (BMI). The 2010 (Allen et al. 2010) and 2014 (Wood et al.
2014) height GWAS had a sample size of 183,727 and 253,288 and identified 180 and 423
genetic loci, respectively. A 2017 study based on 711,428 individuals discovered additional 83
rare (minor allele frequency [MAF]<1%) and low-frequency (1%<MAF<5%) coding variants
associated with height (Marouli et al. 2017). The 2010 (Speliotes et al.) and 2015 (Locke et al.)
GWAS on BMI, respectively, identified 32 and 97 genetic loci. The later round of GWAS
generally included all the observations used in a previous round of GWAS. For example, the
2015 BMI GWAS included all the individuals used in the 2010 BMI GWAS. It was of no surprise
that a later GWAS tended to replicate the loci identified in an earlier GWAS.
The prospect of discovering specific genes for intelligence appeared more daunting than
the genes for anthropometric measures. Human intelligence seems to be much more
complicated than height and weight. Even how intelligence is measured can be highly
contentious. The candidate-gene approach was called into question when Chabris et al (2012)
reported that they could not replicate the previously published associations between 12 specific
genetic variants and cognitive ability. An early GWAS based on 3,511 individuals targeting at

8

intelligence failed to find any signal that was genome-wide significant at P<10x5-8 (Davies et al.
2011).
A 2013 GWAS study of education based on a discovery sample of 101,069 obtained
three SNPs with genome-wide significance, one of the three associated with years of education
and the other two with a college degree (Rietveld et al. 2013). The effect sizes of these SNPs
were about one tenth of those of height and weight. A polygenic score (PGS) constructed from
all common SNPs explained about 2% of the variance in both educational attainment and
cognitive function. Two subsequent GWAS of educational attainment in 2016 (Okbay et al.) and
2018 (Lee et al.) assembled 293,723 and 1.1 million individuals, and reported 74 and 1,271
independent genome-wide significant SNPs associated with years of education, respectively.
The PGS constructed from all common SNPs in the latest GWAS (Lee et al. 2018) obtained an
R2 of about 12% using data from Add Health. Many of the genetic loci were implicated in
biological pathways that played a role during prenatal brain development. The estimated genetic
overlap or the shared genetic influences between years of education and cognitive performance
was about 70% (Supplementary Table 3.1, Okbay et al. 2016), suggesting that the educationbased GWAS-identified genetic variants ought to be reasonable predictors of cognitive ability.
Two successive GWAS of cognitive ability in 2017 (Sniekers et al.) and 2018 (Savage et
al.) employed 78,308 and 269,867 individuals, respectively. The 2018 GWAS identified 205
independent genome-wide significant loci, which included the 15 variants identified in the 2017
GWAS. The PGS based on the 2018 GWAS obtained an incremental R2 of about 5% for
cognitive ability. The study used a variety of tests measuring cognitive ability because the
analysis sample was assembled from more than a dozen cohorts. These tests either measured
fluid intelligence or were used to calculate the Spearman’s g. The genetic correlation between
intelligence and education was estimated again to be about 0.70 with P=2.5x10-287 by the
whole-genome LD score regression (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015), which computed the correlation
between the genetic influences behind intelligence and those behind education. The GWAS9

identified genes were mostly expressed in brain tissues. In the present analysis, the latest
findings of GWAS for intelligence and the findings of GWAS for educational attainment were
used to construct the genomic measures to be included in models predicting verbal ability.
In addition to the two genomic measures of educational attainment and intelligence, we
tested a number of other genomic measures. Previous work documented the association of
academic achievement and educational attainment with obesity (Della Bella and Lucchini 2015;
Roskam et al. 2010), general health (Ickovics et al. 2014), health behavior (McLeod and Kaiser
2004), personality (Lynn and Gordon 1961; McKenzie, Taghavi-Khonsary and Tindell 2000;
Phillips and Endler 1982), stress (McEwen 2000), and brain size (Pietschnig et al. 2015). To
assess the effects of these potential predictors of cognitive ability, we included a number of
PGSs that underlie these phenotypic predictors. These PGSs consisted of those based on
GWAS for general health-related birthweight (Okbay et al. 2016), BMI (Locke et al. 2015),
number of cigarettes smoked per day (Furberg et al. 2010), head circumference (Taal et al.
2012), and each of the big five personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, neuroticism, and openness) (de Moor et al. 2012). We included the PGSs that
underlined these traits rather than observed traits themselves to reduce the difficulty of
interpretation. For example, an observed BMI at 15 years old is likely a result of a host of
genetic and environmental influences the individuals experienced up to that point in life. Some
of these environmental influences are likely to be correlated with those that affect cognitive
development.
Gene-Environment Interactive Effects
Gene-by-environment (GE) interaction refers to the interdependence between an
environmental effect and a genotype effect. In the present setting, our GE-interaction hypothesis
predicts that a favorable SES context enhances the effects of ability PGSs. The reasoning goes
that a favorable SES context would help realize or even raise the cognitive ability of an
individual whereas individuals in an unfavorable SES context would have a verbal ability score
10

below that predicted by his or her ability PGSs. GE-interaction analysis is one of the most
valuable tools of social scientists who strive to understand the interplay between genetics and
SES context. Previous GE-interaction work on cognitive development using biometric data
generated evidence for our hypothesis (Guo and Stearns 2002; Turkheimer et al. 2003). The
present project tested the hypothesis by taking advantage of rich SES-contextual measures and
DNA-based PGSs in Add Health.
Genetic Analysis Using Race/Ethnicity Samples
To include or exclude ethnic minorities in our analysis is an important and difficult issue
(Hindorff et al. 2018). On one hand, the diversity requirement of the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) has been a top priority since the 1993 Revitalization Act that requires that all federally
funded clinical research prioritize the inclusion of women and minorities. Compared with some
other large longitudinal studies in social sciences such as the Health and Retirement Survey
and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, Add Health is particularly well-suited for a study that
includes ethnic minorities because of Add Health’ deliberate inclusion of a large number of
African and Hispanic Americans from the get-go.
On the other hand, it is well-known that the GWAS findings do not apply to ethnic
minorities as well as they do to European Americans. Notable genomic differences across
individuals from different continents have been known since 1990s (Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and
Piazza 1996). The recent 1000-genome project shows that although more than 70% of genomic
variation are common across continental populations, individuals of African descent have about
20% more unique genetic variants than individuals of European ancestry (Consortium 2015).
The published GWAS studies were mostly based on individuals of European descent
including the GWAS that identified the genetic loci associated with educational attainment and
cognitive ability. In the over 3,100 published GWAS by 2017, about 19% of individuals included
in GWAS were non-European and the large majority of the 19% were East Asians (MacArthur et
al. 2017). The partial overlap between the European genetic variants and those of Africans and
11

Hispanics implies that the current GWAS must have missed a substantial number of genetic loci
among the ethnic minorities that are associated with educational attainment and intelligence.
This, in turn, suggests that although the PGSs based on current GWAS can still be significantly
predictive of cognitive ability among ethnic minorities, their predictive power is expected to be
lower in the minority samples than in the European samples (Duncan et al. 2018).
To take advantage of Add Health’ diversified data source, we kept the samples of ethnic
minorities in the analysis. To characterize the potential differential predictability of the PGSs, we
conducted the analysis by ethnicity. To minimize the noises from small samples, we combined
the ethnic groups in analysis when the predictability of the PGSs were similar across the ethnic
groups. Preserving statistical power is crucial because other than genomic differences small
sample sizes could also lead to an idiosyncratic set of findings.
Verbal Ability
At Waves I and III, Add Health implemented an abridged version (AHPVT or PVT) of the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). Our analysis used the percentile rank of
PVT ranging 0-100 that was translated from the raw PVT score. PPVT was first published in
1959 and has been revised three times (Dunn and Dunn 2007). Psychological literature
considers PPVT an estimate of verbal intelligence (Beres, Kaufman and Perlman 1999;
Campbell and Dommestrup 2010). The correlations between PPVT and full-scale intelligence
tests were found to be between 0.40 to 0.60 (Beres, Kaufman and Perlman 1999). Carvajal et
al. (1993) empirically estimated the correlation between the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children-III and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised among children enrolled in
Grades 3, 4, and 5. They obtained statistically significant correlations of .75, .76, and .60,
between PPVT and the Wechsler Vocabulary subtest scaled scores, the Wechsler Verbal
scores, and the Wechsler Full Scale IQ scores, respectively. Bell et al. (2001) compared PPVTIII and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) using a sample of 40 adults
aged 18-41 with a mean of 22 years. Their results showed that PPVT-III was statistically
12

significantly correlated with the WAIS-III full-scale IQ (FSIQ, 0.40) and verbal IQ (VIQ. 0.46),
and that PPVT-III is uncorrelated with performance IQ (VIQ). Compared with full-scale
intelligence tests, PPVT is easier-to-use and time-saving. These are decisive advantages in a
setting of a large survey like Add Health that includes a large number of survey items besides a
verbal ability test.
DATA, MEASURES AND METHODS
Data Source
We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add
Health) (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/), which is an ongoing longitudinal study of a
nationally representative sample of more than 20,000 adolescents in grades 7-12 in 1994-95 in
the United States who have been followed for more than 20 years. Over the years, Add Health
has conducted one in-school survey in 1994-1995, and five in-home interviews in 1994-1995
(Wave 1), 1996 (Wave 2), 2001-02 (Wave 3), 2008 (Wave 4), and 2016-8 (Wave 5). Add Health
includes more than 3,000 individuals who are identical twins, fraternal twins, full siblings, and
half siblings. Add Health has a multiracial and multiethnic sample. The original purpose of Add
Health was to understand the causes of health, health behavior, and educational development
with special emphasis on the role of social context at the levels of family, neighborhoods, and
communities.
We started with a sample of 9,975 individuals for whom GWAS measures were
available. Our final analysis sample consisted of 8,078 individuals. Excluded were those without
a measure of verbal ability (1,859) and those (38) who self-identified as Native Americans. A
total of seven individuals had missing values in one of the following covariates: whether the
respondent was in school before the interview, binge drinking, and marijuana use and smoking.
These seven cases were replaced by the respective sample means. Fifty-one individuals with
missing values in race/ethnicity were reclassified into the category of Hispanics. Missing values
in SES variables were coded into a separate category.
13

In January 2015, Add Health completed genome-wide genotyping on the Wave IV
participants who consented to archive their DNA for future studies. Of the 15,701 respondents
interviewed, 12,200 of the eligible respondents agreed to archive their DNA for future analysis
“related to long term health.” The consent was largely uniform across racial/ethnic groups and
yielded more than 12,000 samples for genome-wide genotyping. Add Health utilized two
Illumina platforms for GWAS: the Illumina Human Omni1-Quad BeadChip at first and the
Illumina Human Omni-2.5 Quad BeadChip at a later time. The two platforms utilized tag SNP
technology to identify and include, respectively, >1.1 million and 2.5 million genetic markers,
which were derived from phases 1-3 of the International HapMap Project (Altshuler et al. 2005)
and the 1,000 Genomes Project (1KGP) (Altshuler et al. 2010).
Measures of Verbal Ability, SES Context and Other Covariates
Verbal Ability was measured by an abridged version (PVT) of the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) implemented twice at Waves 1 and 3 at Add Health. PVT
included 87 or half of the items of PPVT-R. Our analysis used the PVT percentile rank as the
outcome variable. The variable was constructed by computing the unsmoothed percentile rank
for the same-age peers at each Add Health Wave. The resulting percentile rank was
comparable across age groups at the same Wave.
SES Context. Mother’s and father’s education were, respectively, coded into a fourcategory categorical variable with less than high school, high school graduation and some
college, at least college degree, and missing. Mother’s and father’s occupation originally had 16
categories. They were combined into five categories of none and other, which were two of the
original categories of Add Health; manual or blue collar; sales, service, or administrative;
professional or managerial; and missing. Household income was total family income obtained
from the parental questionnaire at Wave 1 in 1994. Household income was coded into a sixcategory variable with cutoff points at 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentile plus a category of
missing. Family structure was measured by a dichotomous variable taking the value of one if the
14

respondent lived with two biological parents and zero if the respondent was from a household of
a single parent, a stepparent, adopted families, and foster homes at Wave 1. Sibship size was
the number of siblings living in the household at Wave 1.
To capture neighborhood disadvantage, we followed the approach used by Wodtke,
Harding and Elwert (2011). Neighborhood disadvantage was measured by the first principal
component from a principal component analysis of six neighborhood measures that included the
proportion of households living below the poverty line, the proportion of adults who were
unemployed, the proportion of female-headed households, the proportion of adult residents
without a high school diploma, the proportion of residents with a college degree, and the
proportion of workers holding managerial or professional jobs. In school was coded as one if the
respondent was in a school session when interviewed or if the respondent was in school in the
past school year when interviewed in a summer break; and in school was coded as zero
otherwise.
In generating covariates, we took advantage of the longitudinal design of Add Health.
Whenever possible, we created time-varying covariates using repeated measures of Add
Health. For example, we generated two measures of neighborhood disadvantage derived from
two rounds of principal component analysis using data at Waves 1 and 3, respectively. These
two measures of neighborhood disadvantage were included longitudinally in our analysis.
Similarly, parental education and occupation were also measured at Waves 1 and 3 and
included as time-varying covariates in analysis.
General Health and Health Behaviors. Self-reported health measured general health of
the respondents at Waves 1 and 3 and was based on an answer to the question of "(I)n general,
how is your health?” The answer had five categories of 1=excellent, 2=very good, 3=Good,
4=fair, and 5=Poor. To facilitate interpretation, the variable was reversely coded so that 1=Poor,
2=Fair, 3=Good, 4=Very good, and 5=Excellent, and treated as a continuous variable in
analysis. Binge drinking was measured by the number of days the respondents drank 5 or more
15

drinks in a row throughout a year at Waves 1 and 3. The survey response categories of bingedrinking every day or 3 to 5 days a week, 1 or 2 days a week, 2 or 3 days a month, 3 to 12 times
in the past 12 months, 1 or 2 days in the past 12 months, and never were coded into 6categorical category variable with never as the reference category. Marijuana use was
measured by the number of times the respondents used marijuana during the past 30 days at
Waves 1 and 3. Those who skipped the question legitimately were coded as 0 and the variable
had a range of 0 to 900. Then the variable was recoded into categories of 0, 1-5, 6-15, 16-30,
and 31 or more. Smoking was measured by the number of cigarettes smoked per day over the
past 30 days. Those who skipped the question legitimately were coded as 0 and the variable
ranged from 0 to 100. The variable was recoded into categories of 0, 1-5, 16-30, and 31-100.
Serious delinquency was constructed from a delinquency scale using 12 questions at
Waves 1 and 3. The scale was similar to those widely used in delinquency and criminal
behavior research (Thornberry and Krohn 2000). The 12 questions were about physical fighting
that resulted in injuries needing medical treatment, use of weapons to get something from
someone, involvement in physical fighting between groups, shooting or stabbing someone,
deliberately damaging property, pulling a knife or gun on someone, stealing amounts larger or
smaller than $50, breaking and entering, and selling drugs. Respondents were asked to report
how many times they had been engaged in the delinquent behaviors in the past 12 months. The
answers are none, 1 or 2 times, 3 or 4 times, and 5 or more times. We recoded them into 0, 1,
2, and 3, respectively, for each item. The scores were then summed up and divided it by twelve.
The results were rounded up and coded into categories of none, 1 or 2 times, 3 or more times,
and missing. Demographic variables included gender, age at Waves 1 and 3, and race and
ethnicity. US born and speaking English at home were used to capture the immigration status of
the respondent.
To address the common difficulty of lack of power in gene-environment interaction
analysis, we constructed an SES Composite (Yang et al. 2017). The SES composite included
16

parental education, parental occupation, household income, sibship size, neighborhood
disadvantage, and in school. Parental education was the higher value of mother’s and father’s
education. Parental occupation was the higher occupational prestige score of the two parents.
The categories of household income and sibship size were treated as continuous. The coding of
neighborhood disadvantage and in school was unchanged. The recoded variables were
individually standardized first. The SES composite was the mean of the six standardized items.
The genomic composite score was constructed similarly from the two ability PGSs.
Genomic Measures
The genomic measures of educational attainment and cognitive ability were based on
the 2018 GWAS of years of schooling (Lee et al. 2018) and the 2018 GWAS of intelligence
(Savage et al. 2018), respectively. In the case of educational attainment, the GWAS separately
regressed each of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on years of
schooling where SNPs were a particular type of genetic variables taking values 0, 1, or 2. The
value represented the number of risk alleles at the genetic loci for the phenotype. The GWAS
obtained one 𝛽𝛽 from each SNP. The study identified 1,271 𝛽𝛽s significant at the genome-wide

level of 5× 10−8. To tap all the predictability of a GWAS, a polygenic score (PGS) for individual i
is often constructed using all 𝛽𝛽s from a GWAS as weights for the observed risk alleles (Χ 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) for

this individual i: 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗=1 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 Χ 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , where i indexes individual, j indexes SNP, and n stands for

the total number of SNPs used in the calculation. The total number of SNPs included in the
calculation were a subset of the GWAS SNPs. The subset was obtained from pruning and
clumping the original GWAS SNPs. The SNPs in the subset were uncorrelated or weakly

correlated with one another. Pruning is used to remove some of the highly correlated SNPs and
clumping is used to keep only one SNP in a section in which the SNPs are highly correlated.
When n is equal to the entire set of SNPs, it is equivalent to setting P=1, where P is the critical
value in a SNP regression.

17

To facilitate interpretation, a PGS is typically standardized into a Z score: 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠 =

[𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 − 𝑀𝑀]/𝜎𝜎, where M is the mean PGS averaged over all individuals in the sample and 𝜎𝜎 is
the standard deviation of the PGS. When 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠 is included in a regression model predicting

verbal ability, its coefficient can be interpreted as the effect of one standard deviation of the
PGS. Thus, the standardized PGSs are a way to estimate and interpret the overall genomic
influence on a phenotype. We have similarly constructed standardized PGSs for intelligence,
BMI, head circumference, cigarette smoke per day, birthweight, and the Big Five personality
traits of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness. In the rest
of this article, we used PGSi to represent 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠 for simplicity.

ANALYTICAL STRATEGIES

Our Add Health data had a hierarchical structure that induces correlation in the outcome
variable and that must be addressed statistically in a regression setting (e.g., Diggle, Liang and
Zeger 1994). One source of the hierarchy was due to the inclusion of the two measures of
verbal ability per individual. The other source of the hierarchy originated from the study design
of Add Health, which included a genetic-informative sample consisting of full siblings, dizygotic
(DZ) twins, monozygotic (MZ) twins, and other related individuals. When these siblings were
first collected, they were the source of information on inheritance for biometric studies. In the
present study, they were complications that needed to be addressed. In our analysis, we
addressed the hierarchy of the data using mixed regression models (Raudenbush and Bryk
2002; Searle 1971; Searle, Casella and McCulloch 1992), which are also referred to as randomeffects models or multi-level models. The mixed models have long been established in the
statistical literature for data that are not independent. We implemented two types of mixed
models written below in the form of multilevel models. The first was a three-level model that
addressed the repeated measures of verbal ability in addition to the sibling clusters:
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽0 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑠𝑠) + 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺′𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝟏𝟏 + 𝑮𝑮′𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝟐𝟐 + 𝑪𝑪′𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝟑𝟑 + 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 , (level 1 model)
18

𝛽𝛽0𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑠𝑠) = 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) +𝜈𝜈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) ,

(1)

(level 2 model)

(level 3 model),

where Vability stands for verbal ability; the subscripts t, i, j, and s index Add Health Wave,
individual, sibship and type of sibship, respectively; SES, G and C are, respectively, vectors of
SES measures, PGSs, and other variables including demographic indicators and principal
components for addressing population admixture; B1, B2, and B3 are vectors representing the
effects of these observed variables; and 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 , 𝜈𝜈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) are random effects at the level of Add
Health Wave, individual and sibship, respectively. We estimated models that distinguished

different types of sibship and models that did not make that distinction, which was equivalent to
ignoring (s). The two sets of estimated coefficients of observed variables were essentially
identical. We only presented estimates from the models that did not make the distinction.
Our mixed model that conditioned on Wave-1 verbal ability was a two-level model that
used verbal ability at Wave 3 as the dependent variable and estimated the effects of the same
set of predictors while controlling for verbal ability at Wave 1:
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉3𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) + 𝜶𝜶𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺′𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝟏𝟏 + 𝑮𝑮′𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝟐𝟐 + 𝑪𝑪′𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝟑𝟑 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , (level 1 model)
𝛽𝛽0𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗(𝑠𝑠) ,

(2)

(level 2 model).

Both (1) and (2) were random-intercept models. Conditional on the random intercepts at the
individual level and the level of sibling clusters, the siblings and repeated measures were
assumed to be independent.
Population admixture or population stratification is a major concern in genetic
association studies. Population groups separated over the past 50,000-100,000 years are likely
to have developed private genetic variants that differ across population groups and that are
unrelated to cognitive ability. If these population groups differ in ability test scores for socialcontextual and other environmental reasons and if these private variants are not controlled
properly, the association between the variants and test scores could be erroneously interpreted

19

as causal. The error can be avoided by the common practice of including the ten or so largest
principle components (PCs) in the regression that links genetic variants to a phenotype (Price et
al. 2006). The PCs represent ancestral genetic differences among population groups and are
highly correlated with self-reported race/ethnicity. GE interaction terms can be added to models
(1) and (2) readily.
FINDINGS
Table 1 showed the means and the standard deviations of the continuous variables, and
the percentage distribution of categorical variables used in the analysis for whites, blacks and
Hispanic blacks, Asians, Hispanic whites, and all ethnicities.
Table 1 about here
Table 2 presented the coefficients and their standard errors of SES context from
random-effects models of twice-measured verbal ability for whites, blacks and Hispanic blacks,
Asians, Hispanic whites, the combined sample of whites, Asians, and Hispanic whites (the
combined sample), and all ethnicities. The random-effects model was a 3-level random-effects
model of verbal ability (Equation 1). Little surprise that the two random effects at the individual
and family levels were highly statistically significant. The OLS R2 was estimated to range from
13.4% to 23.5% across the different samples.
Table 2 about here
The models presented in Table 2 were traditional social-science model that did not
consider genomic influences. SES context was important in all models though some differences
were present across ethnic groups. Among whites, controlling for demographic factors, all
social-contextual characteristics except for mother’s occupation significantly and simultaneously
predicted verbal ability in directions consistent with expectation. For example, individuals whose
mothers with at least a college degree scored 13.5 points higher on the verbal ability test than
those whose mothers with an education less than high school. Those whose fathers with at
least a college degree scored 4.1 points higher than those whose fathers with an education less
20

than high school. Those whose fathers holding a professional and managerial job was about
5.58 points higher than those whose fathers holding a manual and blue-collar job. Individuals
living in a household in the top 20% income group scored about eight points higher than those
in the lowest 20% income group. Individuals living in a household with 3 to 5 siblings scored 5.8
points lower than those who were the only child in a family. An increase in one standard
deviation in the index of the neighborhood disadvantage was associated with a decrease of 0.4
point of verbal ability score at a level of 10 percent. Those who were in a school session when
taking the verbal ability test scored 6.0 points higher than those who were not in a school
session. The coefficients estimated among Asians and Hispanic whites tended to be broadly
similar to those for whites. This observation was the rationale for combining whites, Asians, and
Hispanic whites. In the black sample, the effects of father’s education were much weaker than
those in the white sample and the effects of mother’s occupation were much stronger than those
in the white sample. The estimates in the Asian sample tended to be less statistically significant
than those in the white sample.
Table 3 presented the coefficients and their standard errors of ability-related PGSs from
random-effects models of twice-measured verbal ability for the same set of samples as in Table
2. The PGSs were standardized in the overall sample so that the coefficients across ethnicities
can be compared. Among white respondents, one standard deviation of the education PGS was
associated with 9.56 points of verbal ability or 9.56/50=19% of the mean of verbal ability. The
education PGS was significantly predictive of verbal ability in all estimated models and its
coefficients were similar in size except for the black sample in which the coefficient was much
smaller. The IQ PGS significantly predicted verbal ability in all samples except the black sample.
The ten principal components were mostly significant in the overall sample and the combined
sample because these PCs were highly correlated with race and ethnicity. These results
established the importance of the two PGSs.
Table 3 about here
21

The models in Table 4 included all SES components as well as the two ability-related
PGSs. These models could be compared with the models in Table 2 to assess the impact of the
two PGSs on the effects of SES context. All SES components that were statistically significant
in the model without the two PGSs remained significant in the model with the PGSs. As
expected, the inclusion of the PGSs attenuated the SES effects. In most cases, the inclusion of
the PGSs reduced the SES effects in models in Table 2 by about 10% or less. For example, in
the white sample in Table 2, the two categories of mother’s education “high-school
graduation/some college” and “at least college degree”, respectively, were associated with 6.95
and 13.5 additional points in the verbal ability test score relative to “less than high school” in the
model without the PGSs. The two comparable estimates in the model with the two PGSs in
Table 4 were 6.26 and 12.3, which represented reductions of 9.9% and 9.2%, respectively. In
the black sample, the two comparable reductions were about zero.
Table 4 about here
The incremental R2s or the amount of R2s due to the two PGSs above and beyond the
SES components already included in the models represented a measure of the overall genomic
influence on verbal ability. They could be obtained by subtracting the R2s of the models
containing SES context and the principal components from the R2s in the models in Table 4.
The incremental R2s or the R2s of “pure” PGS effects were 1.8%, 0.1%, 1%, 1.8%, 1.7%, and
1% for whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanic whites, the combined sample and the overall sample,
respectively. These R2s were obtained after removing the impact of the principal components.
The models in Table 5 added a set of predictors to models in Table 4 measuring general
health and health behaviors and a set of non-ability PGSs. The overall impact of these added
predictors on the previous models of SES context and ability-related PGSs was quite modest.
The estimates of SES context and the ability PGSs in Table 4 were generally reduced slightly.
Most of these added estimates were not statistically significant. A few exceptions included

22

negative effects of marijuana use, smoking and the PGS for conscientiousness in the white
sample.
Table 5 about here
The models in Table 6 used SES components and the two PGSs to predict the Wave-3
verbal ability while adjusting for the Wave-1 verbal ability measured about seven years before
the Wave-3 verbal ability (Equation 2). A total of 37 individuals were excluded because an
individual had to contribute two measures of verbal ability to be included in this analysis. Little
surprise that the PVT score at Wave 1 was highly predictive of the PVT score at Wave 3. In the
white sample, an increase of one point in the Wave-1 PVT score was associated with an
increase of about 0.57 points in the Wave-3 PVT score. The effect of one standard deviation of
the education PGS was reduced from 7.0 points in Table 4 to 2.2 points in Table 6; this effect
was still highly significant. The PGS for intelligence lost its statistical significance in all samples.
Adjusting for the Wave-1 PVT, the effects of SES context were expected to be largely
washed out. This was what we observed. Most of the SES components no longer significantly
predicted verbal ability at Wave 3. The two remarkable exceptions were years of education by
Wave 3 and neighborhood disadvantage at Wave 1. The former was significantly predictive of
Wave-3 PVT in every ethnic sample, each additional year of schooling associated with about
two points on the PVT score. It was neighborhood disadvantages in earlier life at Wave 1 rather
than at Wave 3 that turned out to be negatively associated with verbal ability; both were
included in the models. Each standard deviation of neighborhood disadvantages at Wave 1 was
negatively associated with about one point in PVT in the white sample. Living with two biological
parents was positively associated with an increase of 3.6 points of PVT in the black sample. Its
positive effect tended to be washed out or reversed in the other ethnic samples once conditional
on Wave-1 PVT.
Table 6 about here

23

Table 7 showed the main effects and GE interaction effects on twice-measured verbal
ability between a PGS composite constructed from the two ability-related PGSs and a SES
composite in the black sample, the combined sample, and the overall sample. The effects of the
two composites in the main-effects model were significantly predictive of verbal ability in the
three analyses. Out of the three GE interaction models, the interaction term was significant at
the level of 10% in the black sample and the level of <1% in the overall sample while the term
was not significant in the combined sample. In the black sample, those with a value of 1 in the
PGS composite and a value of 1 in the SES composite had a PVT score of 60.47
(60.47=45.8+1.9+9.47+3.3) points, which includes 9.47 points of the main effect of the SES
composite and 1.9 points of the main effects of the PGS composite, and 3.3 points of additional
boost because of GE interaction.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The models of SES context predicted verbal ability well. After demographic variables
and immigration status were adjusted, mother’s education, father’s education, mother’s
occupation, father’s occupation, household income, sibship size, neighborhood disadvantage,
and in school over the past year were all significantly and largely independently associated with
verbal ability. Important differences across ethnic groups did exist. In the black sample, father’s
education was much less influential and mother’s occupation was much more influential than
their counterparts in the white sample. The differences could be explained by the much higher
proportion of female-headed families in the black sample. Table 1 indicated that 30% of black
respondents vs 50% of white ones reported living with 2-biological parents at Wave 1. The
estimates in the Asian sample tended to be less statistically significant for at least three
reasons. Being only one tenth of the white sample, the Asian sample size was likely to be a
major cause of the non-significance. The Asian sample in Add Health was highly heterogeneous
with respect to the age at which they immigrated to the United States, which was a crucial factor
24

for verbal ability in English. The cultural background in the Asian sample was also highly
heterogeneous. The Asian sample consisted of the Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, and
Vietnamese. These patterns of cross-ethnicity differences largely persisted when the ability
PGSs were included in the models.
In the combined sample of whites, Asians, and Hispanic whites, when the ability PGSs
and SES context were in a model simultaneously (Table 4), both tended to continue to
significantly predict verbal ability. All SES predictors that were predictive of verbal ability without
the PGSs remained significantly predictive of verbal ability with the PGSs. The model that
included both SES factors and the ability PGSs yielded an R2 of 21.2%, which represented an
increase of an R2 of 1.7% over the model of SES context, excluding the impact the PCs. The
effect of the education PGS and the effect of the intelligence PGS were reduced about 23% and
28%, respectively, when SES context were added. The reductions in the effects of SES context
were mostly about 10% or less.
The overall payoff of adding general health and health behaviors and non-ability PGSs is
negligible. Only smoking and marijuana use were negatively associated with verbal ability and
these effects were small. Adding the non-ability PGSs did not yield any additional significant
explanatory power to the model. More importantly for the purpose of this analysis, adding these
two classes of factors to the model did not affect the estimates of SES context and the effects of
the two ability PGSs already in the model. In contrast to SES predictors and the ability PGSs,
these other factors were of less consequences to verbal ability.
Moving Wave-1 verbal ability from the left side of the equation to the right side or
conditioning the analysis of Wave-3 verbal ability on Wave-1 verbal ability further tested the
importance of SES context. A coefficient of about 0.6 of Wave-1 verbal ability indicated that
Wave-1 verbal ability predicted Wave-3 verbal ability with 60% accuracy. With the Wave-1
verbal ability adjusted, the estimated effects of the PGSs and SES predictors carried a distinct
meaning. These effects represented the effects above and beyond those that had gone into
25

Wave-1 verbal ability, or above and beyond the effects of the measured and unmeasured
PGSs, SES and other predictors that had already acted upon Wave-1 verbal ability. The PGS
for education was still significantly predictive of Wave-3 verbal ability, but the effect size was
reduced by about two thirds. Two SES predictors stood out: number of years of schooling by
Wave 3 and neighborhood disadvantage at Wave 1. The large effect of year of schooling by
Wave 3, which was significant in every ethnic sample, was particularly noteworthy. The
coefficient of 1.83 implied that an additional year of schooling was associated with almost two
points of verbal ability. Assessing causal effects of schooling on verbal ability was difficult. While
more schooling helps grow verbal ability, individuals with higher verbal ability are likely to seek
and attain more education. We took three measures to address the difficulty. First, the model
controlled for an earlier version of verbal ability, which was equivalent to controlling for the
ability for seeking and attaining education. Second, the model controlled for age at which Wave3 test was taken since age was likely to be positively correlated with the amount of schooling.
Third, we measured schooling by the number of years of schooling before verbal ability was
taken at Wave 3.
Our gene-environment interaction analysis was carried out by interacting a composite
PGS based on the two ability-related PGSs and a composite score for SES context. Two of the
three ethnic samples tested confirmed the theoretical prediction that favorable SES context
boosted the level of cognitive ability predicted by the ability PGSs, augmenting evidence for the
important role of SES context for cognition. The positive effect of GE interaction in the black
sample was at least twice as large as the counterpart in the non-black sample. This contrasted
the much smaller main effect of the education PGS in the black sample than in the non-black
sample.
Carrying out genomic analysis by ethnic group led to a number of insights. The effects of
ability PGSs and SES appeared broadly similar across whites, Asians and non-Hispanic whites.
Although the effect of the education PGS tended to predict verbal ability in the black sample, it
26

was much smaller in size and less significant. We already discussed the lack of African
participation in the current GWAS, which resulted in significantly less than full coverage of
African genetic variants related to cognitive ability. The much smaller black sample was likely
part of the explanation also. Lastly, the much larger positive GE interaction effect in the black
sample indicated that unfavorable SES context played a much larger role in holding back black
youths from realizing their genomic potential for cognitive development. A fuller understanding
of how ability PGSs are related to cognitive development in the black sample has to wait for a
significant expansion of GWAS into the African populations.
The findings from models that included both genomic and SES measures require
careful interpretation. Parental genomes are a common origin of offspring’s genome and SES
context. Parental genomes transmit genetic materials to offspring and shape parental SES such
as parental education, occupation, and income as well as the neighborhood the family lives in
and the schools the children attend. This common origin is the reason for the correlation
between SES context and children’s ability PGSs. A recent Icelandic study of genomic analysis
of educational attainment separated the parental alleles that have been transmitted to the
offspring and the parental alleles that have not been transmitted to the offspring (Kong et al.
2018). Although two generations of genomic data are unavailable in Add Health, the approach
used in the study suggests a way of estimating the extent to which SES context is genomic.
The inclusion of the two ability PGSs and SES context in the same model yielded a
number of invaluable findings. It established the importance of genomic roots of verbal ability.
The estimated effect of the PGS for education was substantial in size, highly significant, and
largely invariant to whether the model included general health and health behaviors, and nonability PGSs. The ability PGSs accounted for 1.7% of the incremental R2 of verbal ability in the
combined sample. In all probability, the measurement of genomic root of verbal ability will
improve. Substantially larger samples than currently used could be assembled to hunt more
genes in fresh GWAS, which focus on common alleles with MAF greater than 5%. A recent
27

study (Marouli et al. 2017) showed that SNPs with MAF<5% can be examined when an
extremely large sample is available and that these rare variants tend to have much larger
effects than common variants. These foreseeable advances plus unforeseeable advances will in
all likelihood raise the percentage of variance that can be explained by genomic measures.
When both SES context and the ability PGSs were included in a model, the effects of
both were estimated with greater accuracy. The estimated effects of SES context were less
“contaminated” by parental genomic sources and they were more the effects of non-genomic
SES context. The effects of the ability PGSs became more truly a reflection of children’s own
genome rather than his or her parents’ genomes. Genetic effects estimated from GWAS
measures without adjusting for family environment are generally exaggerated because such
estimates count the effects of family genomes as the effects of the offspring’s genome (Kong et
al. 2018). In our analysis, adding SES context reduced the effect of the education PGS by more
than 20%, which was our estimated amount of exaggeration when the effect of offspring’s
education PGS was assessed without adjusting for SES context.
Traditional models of SES context such as those in Table 2 were not “pure” socialscience models. With the ability PGSs added to traditional social science models, the relative
importance of non-genomic SES context vs. genomic SES context may be assessed. SES
context could be viewed as consisting two components: the component due to parental
genomics and the component not due to parental genomes. Of the parental genomes that
influence verbal ability through nurturing environment, about 50% of the alleles were transmitted
to the offspring and the other 50% were not transmitted. The transmitted alleles shared between
the parents and the offspring were the reasons why the effects of SES context were reduced by
10% or less. Doubling this 10% or less would be our estimated proportion of the total effects of
SES context that was due to parental genomes. The doubling was needed because only 50% of
the influential alleles were transmitted.

28

Given these estimates, SES context remained a dominant force on verbal ability. Nongenomic effects accounted for >80% of SES effects. Even this <20% genomic SES effects
could be viewed as environmentally nurturing because they acted from outside the offspring and
constituted part of the offspring’s environment. The dominance of SES context was also
indicated by the contrast between the R2 of 17.5% in the model of SES text (Table 2) and the
incremental R2 of 1.7%, which was due to the ability PGSs.
While it is true that the current genomic measures of cognitive ability are
underestimated, the same could be said about SES context. Presently, SES is measured by
crude categories of parental characteristics such education and occupation. Within each of
these parental categories, the differences made by idiosyncratic nurturing styles of parents are
largely uncaptured.
Social scientists have long considered SES context fundamentally important in shaping
life outcomes including cognitive ability (e.g., Duncan, Brooksgunn and Klebanov 1994; Fischer
et al. 1996; Hauser 2010; McLeod and Shanahan 1993). With genomic influences measured at
individual level and included in the model, we confirmed the importance of SES context. After
all, the worth of cognitive ability including verbal ability depends heavily on the context of
modern education and society. At the same time, the modern educational system and society
depend on social fabrics such as family, schools, and neighborhoods to bring about the
intellectual potential of individuals. The eminence of these social fabrics will persist unless their
functions are replaced by institutions other than family, schools, and neighborhoods.
