Climatic Changes, Government Interventions, and Paddy Production: An Empirical
Study of the Muda Irrigation Area in Malaysia

Abstract

The Muda Irrigation Area is one of the main paddy production areas in Malaysia. Various
efforts and approaches through government interventions have been implemented to ensure
the continuity of paddy production in this area. However, there are different factors that have
negative impacts on paddy production including climatic factors. Therefore, with the direct
components of production such as land, labor, and technology, this study uses climatic factors
and government intervention to examine the influence of these factors of production on the
paddy production in this area. Based on the time series data from 1981 to 2010, this study
conducted the multiple log linear Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression by considering the
Cobb-Douglas production function model. The major units of production, such as land,
labour, and technology, have a statistically positive relationship with paddy production.
Among the climatic variables, rainfall and the number of rainy days show a statistically
significant and positive relationship but temperature shows a negative relationship with
paddy production. The factors of external intervention such as government subsidies and
market forces also show a statistically significant and positive relationship with paddy
production. To ensure the improvement of paddy production as well as to minimize the
effects of climatic change, government intervention should be continued in Malaysia.

Introduction

In Malaysia, paddy is a commodity that is under protection by the government and is
categorized as one of the commodities in achieving the national self-sufficiency level. In
2014, the country issued 3,521 million tons of paddy where 2,645 million metric tons were
produced and the rest were imported. However, to ensure the production of paddy at the selfsufficiency level (SSL), the government has invested considerably over the years. In addition,
various forms of assistance or subsidies have been created to improve paddy production.

However, the production of paddy is related to natural factors such as rainfall and
temperature that ensure the growth of crops in a good condition, which would provide a high
yield. Recent climate uncertainty has an impact on the crop production. Events such as flood
and drought not only reduce the production but it also results in the destruction of crops.
Siwar et al. (2009) explained that climate change affects food production through geographic
changes, unavailability of water for irrigation purposes, and the loss of land due to the rising
sea level. Total yearly rainfall in Malaysia is increasing and its monthly variation is too high.
The effect of lower rainfall can be controlled through a proper irrigation system, but the
opposite phenomenon of over rainfall at any particular time, especially at the end of the crop
cycle or at the maturity period that causes serious damage to crops, is completely
uncontrollable (Alam et al., 2011a).
Under the current climate change scenario, temperatures of above 25oC may decline
the grain mass by 4.4% per 1oC rise (Tashiro & Wardlaw, 1989), and grain yield may decline
as much as 9.6%-10.0% per 1oC rise (Baker & Allen, 1993). On average, the temperature in
paddy growing areas in Malaysia is about 26oC. Singh et al. (1996) mentioned that the actual
farm yields of paddy in Malaysia vary from 3-5 tons per hectare, while the potential yield is
7.2 tons. It is also mentioned that there would be a decline of paddy yield between 4.6%6.1% per 1oC temperature increase under the present CO2 level, but a doubling of CO2
concentration (from the present level of 340ppm to 680ppm) may offset the detrimental effect
of a 4oC temperature increase on the paddy production in Malaysia. A study found that a 1%
increase in temperature leads to 3.44% decrease in the current paddy yield and 0.03%
decrease in paddy yield in the following season, and a 1% increase in rainfall leads to 0.12%
decrease in the current paddy yield and 0.21% decrease of paddy yield in the following
season (Alam et al., 2014).

The projections of rainfall and temperature based on the ongoing activities that
strongly influence the climate factors in Malaysia reveal an alarming situation in the future.
The projection also shows that by 2050, the maximum monthly precipitation will increase up
to 51% over Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu, while minimum precipitation will decrease
between 32% and 61% throughout Peninsular Malaysia. Consequently, annual rainfall will
increase up to 10% in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and North West Coast, and decrease to
5% in Selangor and Johor (NAHRIM, 2006). Another projection shows that any changes,
both positive and negative, of more than only 0.4% by 2020, will cause the yield of paddy
3

production in Malaysia to fall (Ramadasan et al., 2001). Due to high greenhouse gas
emissions, the temperature is projected to rise by 0.3oC to 4.5oC in Malaysia. Warmer
temperatures will cause a rise in the sea level by about 95cm over a hundred-year period. The
changes in rainfall may fluctuate from about -30% to +30%. This change will reduce crop
yield and many areas will be prone to drought thus cultivation of some crops such as rubber,
oil palm, and cocoa will not be possible.

Further, Malaysian Meteorological Department (2009) simulated twelve coupled
Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), which show an increasing
temperature trend for the three domains – Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak (Table
1). The projected temperature increase among the nine AOGCMs for East Malaysia and
Peninsular Malaysia are 1.0oC-3.5oC and 1.1oC-3.6oC, respectively. The ensemble rainfall is
projected to increase most significantly in western Sarawak in comparison to other regions in
Malaysia. Rainfall over the western Peninsular Malaysia is projected to increase while there
is reduction in projection for eastern Peninsular Malaysia.

Moreover, the climatic factors affect, directly or indirectly, the social and economic
sustainability of the farmers. Climate changes cause crop damages, low productivity, and
high production cost that lead to losses in farmers’ income, increments in poverty levels, and
increase in the seasonal unemployment rate (Alam et al. 2010b; 2011b). In Malaysia, the
most vulnerable states in terms of poverty are Sabah (23%), Terengganu (15.4%), Kelantan
(10.6%), Sarawak (7.5%), Kedah (7%), Perlis (6.3%), and Perak (4.9%), where the projected

4

temperature and rainfall changes are also very high (Ninth Malaysia Plan, 2006; NAHRIM,
2006). Therefore, in order to support the farmers and increase productivity as well as to
increase the income of farmers, the government’s intervention, especially through subsidy
and incentives, are now essential in Malaysia. Abdullah et al. (2010) mentioned that the
subsidy scheme has been able to increase the income of farmers, but in the absence of any
subsidy schemes, the paddy production industry does not have high resistance and will not be
viable. The Farmers Organization Authority (2008) also claims that the Fertilizer Subsidy
Program works, as it provides encouragement and increases the interest of farmers to remain
in the paddy production sector.

It is worth noting that the government of Malaysia currently provides huge amounts
of subsidy to the paddy producers (Siwar et al., 2014). The government has allocated
RM11,435 million for agricultural development in the 9MP (2006), which was increased by
RM3,686 million (47.6%) from the 8MP. Until now, many policies have been introduced by
the government to protect this sector such as price policy, subsidization policy, price
stabilization policy, trade policy, etc. as summarized below.

proposed appointment of GMP.

Price Stabilization Implemented since the 1980s, through
Policy (PSP)
the National Paddy and Rice Authority
and managed by Padiberas Nasional
Berhad (BERNAS) after 12 January
1996. Objectives to increase the income
of farmers in PSP above the national
poverty line and ensure that the price of
rice in the market can be maintained at
the level set by the Government for the
interest of consumers.
Government payments to the PSP is
given to all farmers registered with the
PSP Scheme, who sell rice from fields
operated by themselves or by wages in
the Rice Mills registered with BERNAS.

Therefore, with the direct components of production such as land, labor, and
technology, this study aims at investigating the influences of climatic factors and government
intervention on the paddy production in Malaysia based on a time series database on the
Muda Irrigation Area.

Paddy Production in the Muda Irrigation Area

Basic adequacy of the local paddy through local production was the main policy of the
government starting from 1955 until several years after the country had achieved
independence. Change and the achievement of the target of this commodity at the SSL was
translated into the five-year Malaysia Plan, National Agricultural Policy, Food Security
Policy, New Economic Model, and the latest Agro-Food Policy. In order to achieve the
objective, the government has developed eight paddy bowls in the country. One of the major
paddy bowls is the Muda Irrigation Area (Figure 1). In 2010, the government allocated RM
41.383 million to the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA) to conduct the
6

development and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure in the Muda Irrigation Area
(Malaysia, 2010a). To date, this irrigation area has contributed more than 40 percent of paddy
production at the level of self-sufficiency of the country. The area is the largest direct
contributor of paddy in the country ensuring food safety (Table 3).

Based on Table 3, the Muda Irrigation Area has contributed more than 40 percent of
the country's paddy production, except for the years 2000 and 2010, when the yield was
7

around 39.60 percent and 39.53 percent, respectively. For a period of 40 years (1970 to
2010), the paddy production at the Muda Irrigation Area had contributed to the SSL of the
country with an average of 45.6 percent. The percentage of this contribution defines the
Muda Irrigation Area as the biggest contributor in ensuring food security in Malaysia. At the
same time, the contribution of the Muda Irrigation Area also demonstrates that SSL
investment and the government's efforts in ensuring the country's paddy supply in the Muda
Irrigation Area has shown results of success despite having to deal with a variety of
constraints such as natural disasters, diseases, and so on.

Natural disasters over the last few years have also affected paddy production patterns
in the Muda Irrigation Area. A total of 48,693 hectares of fields have been affected by floods
that have occurred from 2005 to 2010, resulting in a total of 32,794 paddy farmers being
affected by this incident (MADA 2011). This has an impact on the production of paddy and
SSL, and it affects the farm infrastructure in the area; it also affects the livelihood of the
paddy farmers. Therefore, to achieve SSL in the paddy production in Muda Irrigation Area,
extensive government interventions are conceded as very crucial factor (Johnson, 2000).

Methodology

With the direct components of production such as land, labor, and technology, this study used
climatic factors and government intervention to examine the influence of the factors of
production on paddy production in the Muda Irrigation Area. The time series data set from
1981 to 2010 was collected from MADA, the Meteorology Department, the Agriculture
Department, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Agro-Based Industry.

To draw inference, this study conducted the multiple log linear Ordinary Least Square
(OLS) regression by considering the Cobb-Douglas production function model. The model is
as follows:

Based on the micro data from the Muda Irrigation Area, this study found several
variables that are significant to paddy production (Table 6). The value of R2 indicates the
good fitness of a model. The R2 is 0.93, which means the independent variables considered
under this study can explain 93% of the dependent variable. The Durbin-Watson (DW) value
shows that there is no autocorrelation.

***, **, and * are significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% significance level, respectively

Two major units of production – land and labour – are found to be statistically
significant with paddy production at the 1% significance level. If the land area increases by
1%, the production of paddy will increase by 0.85%; and if the labour increases by 1%, the
production of paddy will increase by 0.65%. However, the decrease in the production area in
terms of damage to crops due to pest attacks and diseases does not show a statistically
significant relationship with paddy production, even at the 10% level. Another core unit of
production is technological usage, which shows a statistically significant and positive
relationship with paddy production at the 10% level. A 1 unit change in technology will lead
to 0.05 unit change in paddy production.

Among the climatic variables, temperature and the number of rainy days are found to
be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, with rainfall at the 5% significance
level with paddy production. Rainfall and the number of rainy days show a positive
relationship but temperature shows a negative relationship with paddy production. A 1%
increase in temperature will lead to the reduction of paddy production by 2.83%. A 1%
increase in rainfall and the number of rainy days will lead to an increase in paddy production
at 0.15% and 0.45%, respectively. However, the study did not find any statistically significant
relationship between floods and the total paddy production in the study area.

The factors of external intervention such as government subsidies and market forces
also show a statistically significant and positive relationship with paddy production at a 1%
significant level. A 1% increase in government budget and a 1 unit change in incentive will

11

lead to 0.06% and 0.22 unit increase in paddy production, respectively. Moreover, if the
market price of paddy increases by 1 unit, the production of paddy will increase by 0.21 unit.

Discussion

There are several empirical studies on climate change and food security. Most of the studies
identify and predict the impact of climate change on the world, especially in terms of food
production. Various previous studies have also predicted and measured the changes in
agriculture due to climate change in Malaysia based on macro studies (Ali & Ali, 2009;
Tilman et al., 2002; Socolow, 1999; Alexandratoss, 1999; Reilly, 1999; Schimmelpfenning et
al., 1996; Singh et al., 1996; Penning de Vries, 1993). This study is based on the micro data
on the Muda Irrigation Area to find out the more rigorous impacts of climatic changes and
government interventions on paddy production in Malaysia.

This study found that climatic factors have impacts on the paddy production in the
Muda Irrigation Area. If the temperature increases, the paddy production will decline further
in the future. Several studies have also found similar results as mentioned above. Rainfall
shows a positive relationship with paddy production, but if the number of rainy days
increases, it will damage the crops and cause floods. In 2005, the incidence of flooding had
resulted in damages to 18,246.16 hectares of crops, which involved 10,575 farmers, and the
government provided assistance of RM 39.3 million to the affected farmers in this area
(MADA, 2010).

Government intervention through providing subsidies, incentives, and buying paddy
from farmers at a high price has significant impacts on paddy production in the area. These
subsidies involve cash benefits for utilizing land for paddy production, providing raw
materials such as seeds, fertilizer, and pesticide, and developing the infrastructures related to
paddy production including irrigations, dams, roads, machinery support, etc. (Alam et al.,
2010a). Government intervention is still needed because the cost of paddy production in the
country is still higher compared to importing paddy. If the government reduces or
discontinues the assistance, it will adversely affect the paddy production in Malaysia (Alam
et al., 2011b).

The production of paddy also depends on various other factors such as timing of water
and fertilizer usage, control and monitoring of pests and diseases, harvesting on time, etc. At
the same time, to improve the production of paddy, farm management practices and
supporting services such as supply of water, fertilizer, and pest control service, etc. should be
timely. The production practices of farms and individual farmers also need to be updated with
the changes of climate factors such as applying crop rotation, crop portfolio, crop
substitutions, etc. (Alam et al., 2010b). For long term sustainability of the paddy production,
introducing new technology and the adoption of technology by farmers are very important. At
the same time, mitigation options should be followed up at the policy level.
Conclusions
Climate is changing all over the world, but the phases of changes and effects are different
among areas and sectors. Agricultural productions as well as the socioeconomic status of
farmers are significantly affected due to the climate change in Malaysia. Therefore, to combat
the climatic effects, government bodies are providing subsidies and incentives, which are also
increasing day by day. However, there are no proper alternative mitigation and adaptation
programs to make this sector sustainable and to improve the livelihood in the long run.
Mitigation is a macro issue involving a long term, expensive process, but not sufficient to
avoid the significant impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2007). It is therefore important to
balance the measures against the causes of climate change and the measures to cope with its
adverse effects (Stern, 2007; Pielke et al., 2007).

In the micro level, adaptation is essential for agricultural and livelihood sustainability
in Malaysia. Adaptation approaches need to be followed at the individual farmer level and
policy level through technological developments, government programs, farm production
practices, and farm financial management (Smit & Skinner, 2002). Adaptations will be highly
dependent on technology in the long-run and financial protection in the short-run. While
focusing on financial protection, the government needs to make proper subsidy policies to
ensure the SSL production and financial sustainability of the farmers and their farms. Good
Agricultural Practices (GAP) should be regularly updated in addition to ensuring cooperation among different groups, stakeholders, and agencies that are critical to cope better
with the changing nature of the climate.
