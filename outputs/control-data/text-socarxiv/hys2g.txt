Abstract
What is good and evil? This is probably one of the most frequently asked questions in the history
of human kind. Moral decisions can be very hard in particularly when people are just starting
their adventure with an adult life, that is, in their early 20’s. This report shows the moral
condition of academic youth from one of the most religious regions in Poland. Therefore, the
focus of this study was to show the relationship between religion and morality of young Poles.
This article presents the results of a survey study conducted among 139 students of the
University of Rzeszow attending the 2006/2007 academic year. The results showed that the
morality of surveyed students seems to depend in a high degree on circumstances of situations
(i.e., moderate moral relativism) rather than absolute norms. Moreover, the comparison of the
results of this study with previous questionnaire research conducted at the same institution in
mid-90’s show that religion has smaller impact on moral choices of academic youth from
Subcarpathia province. Importantly, this study shows that more students reported overall weaker
role of religion in their lives than it was observed previously.

Introduction
In the conditions of modernizing societies, many areas of everyday life of their members,
including their religious and moral dimension, are changing. Many sociologists wonder whether
these changes will lead Polish society to similar transformations that has been observable in highly
pluralistic and modern societies (Borowik, Doktór 2001: 44-46, Mariański 2008:269-272).
Namely, to the individualization of the social awareness of individuals, and thus to the
privatization and rationalization of morality (Bauman 1996: 29-32). Also if thosae change will
lead to the secularization and globalization of religion (Borowik, Doktór 2001:16-22), as well as
to the break-up of a relationship between religion and morality (Mariański 2008:269).
Polish society, due to its belonging to the Western World, is becoming more similar to their
modern Western neighbors. However, as Marek Ziółkowski (2006) emphasized, it has the
characteristics of both traditional and modern society. For example, in some areas resembles
commonly observed in Western societies: post-modern consumption (Ziółkowski 2006:154). The
transformations of the traditional molar and religious values and norms has been also taking place
in the Polish society. However, they do not progress as quickly and intensively as they have been
doing in the West (Mariański 2002:483 and 2008:295). This situation is related to the high position
of religion, and more precisely, Catholicism in the everyday life of Poles (Mariański 2002:483;
Borowik 2003:52). It is enough to mention that in the research conducted by the Public Opinion
Research Center (Polish aberration: CBOS), the vast majority of members of the Polish society
declare themselves to be religious (69%), and over half (56%) practice at least once a week (CBOS
Communicate {nr 191} December 2006). Importantly, as for 2015 the region in Poland with the

3

highest percentage (91 %) of people declaring themselves as believers and deep believers in
religion is Subcarpathia province (GUS Report, 2017).
In view of the above, it is worth asking the following question: how morality and religiosity
of the academic youth studying at the main university of the Subcarpathia province (University of
Rzeszow) have been affected by those socio-cultural changes actually happing in post-modern
Polish society? This article will try to answer this question by analyzing results of a survey research
targeting attitudes of participants towards specific moral norms and values and the relationship
between morality and religion. The first hypothesis for this project was proposing that: Participants
would show attachment to general moral norms commonly accepted in Polish society, however,
their moral behavior would be characterized by more moderate relativism than absolutism. The
second hypothesis claimed that religion would have weaker influence on moral choices of
Rzeszów’s students than it had in previous years.
It should be pointed out that, in this paper the results of the current questionnaire study
were compared with the results of other authors who investigated the morality and religiosity of
Rzeszów students in the last twenty years. The first one was Paweł Grygiel, who conducted his
research in the academic year 1998/1999 (Grygiel 2002), and the second one was Artur Grzesik,
who studied students in the 1995/1996 academic year (Grzesik 2002). Both of them conducted
their research at the Higher School of Education (Polish aberration: WSP) in Rzeszów, which in
2001 was transformed (together with the Institute of Sociology in Rzeszów and with other
institutions and departments) into the University of Rzeszów.

The methodological remarks
The article will present selected results of the questionnaire survey, showing the moral and
religious dimension of everyday life of academic youth from Podkarpacie region. The research
took place at the turn of May and June 2007 at the University of Rzeszów.
Participants
The total sample was 139 students studying at two faculties of the University of Rzeszów,
that is, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and History and Sociology. The sample was divided
into layers, the criterion for each of them was the year of study, faculty and gender.
Slightly more students in year IV (54.0%) than in year I (46.0%) and almost identical
percentage of students studying at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (52.5%) and SocioHistorical (47.5%) were examined. In the case of gender, among the surveyed students there were
more women (53.2%) than men (46.8%).
Moreover, in the analyzed sample the highest percentage was constituted by people from
rural areas, i.e. 45.3%, followed by people from cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants - 23.0%
(probably most of them were from Rzeszów). A similar percentage of people living in mediumsized and small towns was recorded (16.5% and 15.1% respectively). In total, there were 56.4%
of people living permanently in cities.
The majority of respondents (56.1%) indicated that they were of working class origin, over
a quarter (26.6%) chose intelligent origin, and almost one sixth (15.8%) decided to indicate peasant
origin, two people did not answer. The respondents most often described the financial situation of
the family as average (43.9%), fairly good (40.3%) and definitely good, only five students
indicated a rather bad answer, and two very bad ones.

Questionnaire
The research tool was a survey entitled "Students and moral values", which consisted of
45 questions, including 8 metric questions. The issues related to the attitude of the respondents
towards assessments, norms and moral values present in their everyday life were treated the most
extensively. In addition, some questions focused on religious issues and the interrelationship
between religions and morality. Most of them were closed or semi-closed questions.
Operational definitions of Morality, Religiosity, Norms and Values (Core and Personal)
Starting the research, a neutral definition of morality was used, which can be presented in
the following way after Janusz Mariański: morality is "a certain set of norms and behaviors
understood in terms of good and bad"(1989:130). In order to measure this phenomenon,
parameters of moral norms and values (see below) were used.
When studying religiosity, the definition of Władysław Piwowarski was used: " a set of
institutional beliefs, values and symbols, as well as related behaviors, which result from the
differentiation between empirical and non-empirical reality and from the assignment of matters of
empirical reality to matters of empirical reality to non-empirical reality". (1996: 49).
Norms were understood as: "statements of duty (...) containing more or less general
indications as to how to behave in certain situations". (Mariański 1989:65). In turn moral norms
are such norms, which "indicate how a person should act towards other people and towards himself
or herself". (Mariański 1989:144).
The idea of value was defined according to Hepp, as: "internalised standards of behaviour
inherited by individuals in the process of socialization in the cultural context of a particular society.
(Hepp quoted from Piwowarski 1996:242). In that vein, the Core values meant "a greater or lesser

6

range of values accepted by all or at least most members of the community, on the basis of which
they reach consensus, dialogue and cooperation for the common good" (Brewery 1996:243). On
the other hand, the definition of the personal values focused on the individual needs of the members
of a given community. Personal values include daily and final values. Daily values are "life goals
and aspirations, mobilizing for everyday activity". (Mariański 1995:162). In turn, the final values
"determine the final state of human aspirations, aspirations and actions". (Mariański 1995:161).
Norms were understood as: "statements of duty (...) containing more or less general indications
as to how to behave in certain situations". (Mariański 1989:65). In turn moral norms are such
norms, which "indicate how a person should act towards other people and towards himself or
herself". (Mariański 1989:144).

Results
Main moral orientations

A pluralism of norms and values, moral attitudes can have a dual character. First of all,
they can take on an absolutist dimension, i.e. the norms they follow and values are rigorously
respected regardless of the situation. Secondly, the individual in moral choices leans towards
relativism, i.e. depending on the circumstances he or she is guided by a given norm or trusts a
given value. In other words, from the relativistic point of view, there is no single and always valid
normative system. It is worth noting that this type of attitude, by many authors, is treated as
characteristic of people living in the contemporary Western World (Mariański 2002:485; Bauman
1996:31). However, the two types of attitudes mentioned above may interfere with each other, and
it is possible to encounter moderate and extreme absolutism or moderate and extreme relativism.
In this section of the report there are questions investigating those four types of moral attitudes.

7

In the first question the participants were faced with two theorems: 1 - "There are
completely clear criteria for determining what is good and what is bad. They apply to everyone,
regardless of their circumstances", and 2 - "There is no clear definition of what is good and what
is bad and absolute criteria for determining what is good and what is bad. Good and evil depend
on each other and to a large extent from the circumstances." They were then asked to choose the
one that was closer to their views, and the students could either reject it or choose to answer it: "I
can't say. The distribution of answers given to this question is presented in Table 1.

The second thesis is true for the majority of Rzeszów students. Thus, the relativistic attitude
is closer to them. However, the respondents were not unambiguous in such an assessment, a
substantial part of the surveyed students rigorously assessed their views on moral issues. In
comparison to the research conducted by Paweł Grygiel in the end of the 90’s (1998/99) the
percentage of people approving the first thesis increased. The results of the comparison show that
the percentage of support for the second statement decreased slightly (from 27.0% to 38.8% in
2007) and the percentage of support for the second statement decreased slightly (from 59.7% to
54.7%).
Continuing this topic of the survey, an attempt was made to expand the choice of the
surveyed students. The respondents were asked to choose one of four types of attitudes:

8

Fundamental Attitude - one should have clear moral principles and never deviate from them;
Moderate Compromising Attitude - one should have clear moral principles, but in some
situation, it is possible to deviate from them, however, those situations have to be exceptional.
Extremely Compromising Attitude - one must have certain moral principles, but there is nothing
wrong with it when one departs from them in relation to the requirements of various life situations.
Purposeful Attitude – One should not have any clear moral principles, however, one should
behave accordingly to a given situation. The results are presented in Table 2.

As it can be observed, the students were most satisfied with the combination of absolutism
and relativism (moderately compromise attitude). This means that for Subcarpathia youth it was
important to be able to choose in the course of making decisions of a moral nature, but still there
are certain limits that they do not want to cross. Compared to previous surveys, there are significant
differences in opinions of students from the 21st century and those studying at the time when the
surveys were conducted by Grzesik (2002) and Grygiel (2002). Table 3 illustrates this very well.

The differences between the referenced studies may be dictated by the socio-cultural and
economic transformation, which have been influencing Polish society for past two decades. As
Bauman pointed out living in a world of many options requires an individual to be creative in
solving one’s issues (Bauman 1996:32). In that situation, very strict moral norms may be useful or
not, but certainly fewer and fewer people (in comparison to previous studies) believed that
adherence to the rules will lead them to their goal. The clear increase in indications of a moderate,
extreme compromise attitude, and the corresponding decrease in the participants’ recognition of
the fundamental attitude may lead to a conclusion that that also among Rzeszów students, the
requirements of the situation often take priority over the challenged norms. On the other hand, a
smaller percentage of indications for the purposeful attitude in 2007 may suggest that more people
was aware that they need some moral principles.
Until now, the focus of this report has been on showing the basic moral preferences of the
studied youth, however, the survey contained more detailed description of attitudes of the
respondents towards specific moral issues. The surveyed students were presented with a list of 23
socially condemned behaviors, and then asked to respond to each of them individually. The
respondents used a five-point Likert scale to answer this question, details of which can be found
in Table 4.

After prioritizing the acts listed in Table 4 in the order from least to most reprehensible,
the "use of contraceptives" comes first. - 16.5% (sum of responses: "definitely yes" and "rather
yes"), and then there's the "departure from the faith." (18.0%), "not going to church" (20.2%), "a
lie in defense of oneself or another human being" (24.0%), "work on Sundays and public holidays"
(32.3%), "inaccurate performance of duties at work or at university". (37.4%), "divorce" (42.4%),
"homosexual relations" (42.4%). (49.7%), "suicide" (61.1%), "conscious buying of stolen goods"

11

(63.3%), "euthanasia" (64.1%), "not keeping our promises." (69.8%), "religious intolerance"
(69.8%), "abortion" (69.8%), "abortion" (69.8%). (71.2%), "alcohol abuse" (73.3%), "expressing
views contrary to one's own beliefs for personal gain". (74.1%), "drug use" (81.3%), “use of the
official post for own benefit” (81.3%), 'use of the official post for own benefit (82.0%), "accepting
bribes" (84.9%), "denunciation" (85.6%), "perjury" (86.0%), "neglect of older parents" (90.6%),
"Marital infidelity" (92,0%).
The surveyed students in the least degree condemned moral problems related to with
religious life, the best example of which is the high percentage of answers "rather not" and
"definitely not" for condemnation of not going to church (62.6%) and departing from faith
(55.4%). Moreover, the ban on using contraceptives does not induce any significant repulsion
among the respondents. On the contrary, the majority of respondents indicated the answer "rather
not" and "definitely not" when assessing the act as immoral (the sum of these two answers is 72.6%). The issue of homosexual relations, which for less than half of the respondents (49.7%) is
an immoral act, also deserves attention. Behavior affecting private and public life of the
respondents was marked by the highest degree of condemnation. For the vast majority of the
surveyed young people, the family deserved the greatest respect and behaviors detrimental to their
existence are most often condemned.
It is worth noting that in comparison to Grygiel's research (2002), who asked about the
attitude towards similar norms (with the exceptions for homosexuality and euthanasia questions),
there are important changes in the hierarchy of moral contaminated acts. The greatest differences
were noted in the case of accepting bribes (in 1998/99 it was indicated by 75.8% and in 2006/07
by 84.9%), neglect of older parents (in 1998/99 - 95.6% and in 2006/07 - 90.6%), marital infidelity
(according to the above mentioned order 86.5% and 92.0%) and extortion of opinions contrary to
12

one's beliefs (81.5% and 74.1%). Particularly important seems to be the clear "leap" in the case of
"marital infidelity". This fact can be explained by the willingness of young people to create a
partnership model of marriage, where betrayal is something unacceptable for both sides. However,
the appearance of "bribery" in the top five acts deserving of condemnation may be the result of the
period of this study, because from the late 1990s to the first months of 2007, many corruption
crimes were discovered on the highest levels of governmental power such as: The "Starachowicka
affair", the "Rywin affair" or the “Land affair". Confronting other moral assessments, there are no
great differences, both studies show that behaviors, which violate religious and sexual life, are the
least condemned and most often Rzeszów students negatively assess behaviors that violate the
world of human and family relations.
The presented part of the study on general moral orientations confirmed the author's
assumptions about the dominance of a moderately relativistic view of reality among Rzeszów
students. However, the last of the presented questions showed that for young people, although the
relative view of reality is important, there are behaviors that should be condemned especially when
they affect family life.
Religion and its influence on morality of Rzeszów students

Religion has been considered as one of the most important factors shaping morality in
society (Mariański 1989:201). Its value as a "guardian" of morality was particularly evident in the
traditional society (Ossowska 1986:110). Maria Ossowska listed five types of relations between
religion and morality. The first one has a genetic character, i.e. a being considered as God is
simultaneously a codifier of moral norms. The second is a logical relationship - moral rules result
from dogmas of faith. The third is a psychological dependence, which is created in consciousness

13

from an early childhood, when you are raised in faith in the relationship between religion and
morality. Fourthly, moral norms are subject to the influence of religious thought. The last
relationship is the relationship between religiousness and the moral level, a strong religious faith
increases the motivation not to break moral norms (1986:110-111).
However, the influence of religion on morality is no longer as strong as in the past.
Nowadays, when faced with moral dilemmas one often uses non-religious justifications for one's
behavior, often completely contrary to the declared religious faith (Mariański 2008:269). This part
of the report will focus on understating the place of religion in the moral awareness of Rzeszów
students. It should be emphasized that prior to the research it was assumed that the majority of the
surveyed students were Roman Catholics. In 1999, in a survey conducted by Paweł Grygiel, 94.8%
of respondents confirmed their membership in the Roman Catholic Church in a group of over 500
Rzeszów students (see, Grygiel 2002:108).
One of the first questions in the survey regarding the role of religion in lives of Rzeszow
students was a question looking at the self-declaration of faith of the surveyed youth. To be more
precise, the respondents were asked the following question: "What is your attitude to faith?
Respondents chose between five options presented in Table 5.

As can be seen in Table 5 non-religious or faith indifferent attitudes are rare, the students
surveyed are in the vast majority (82.8%) religious persons (believers and deeply believing).
However, the confrontation of the results with those obtained by Grzesik and Grygiel provides
interesting observations. There is a decrease in the percentage of respondents declaring themselves
to be deeply believers (from 15.2% in 1995 and 10.5% in 1998 to 8.6% in 2007). On the other
hand, there are more believers (69.0%, 71.4% and 74.1% respectively). Comparing the other
categories, it can be seen that the percentage of respondents declaring indecisiveness in relation to
their faith decreased (from 11.3% and 14.3% to 7.2%), while the percentage of indifferent (from
1.75%, 1.6% to 6.8%) and non-believers (from 1.8% and 2.2% to 3.6%) increased. Therefore, it
seems that the results of this survey showed a decrease in the intensity of the declared faith (Grygiel
2002: 118; Grzesik 2002: 94). This pattern observed here is following the results of Grygiel (2002),
who assessed this state of affairs in the following way: "among academic youth from Rzeszów,
there is a slight trend towards religious indifference, which at the same time does not mean a
clearly defined lack of faith". (Grygiel 2002:121).
In order to learn more about the general characteristics of religiousness of the studied
youth, the examined students were asked a question about the intensity of practicing. Proposed
answers and distribution of results are presented in Table 6.

According to the data presented in Table 6, the majority of responders (64.0%: the sum of
the first and second options) are regular practitioners, that is, they either go to their church every
Sunday or every Sunday and sometimes more often. 28.9% responders (the sum of 3 and 4
answers) attend their church rather irregularly (either few times per month or per year). Only 6.5% of the surveyed youth do not practice at all.
Comparing the results with those from the studies of previous academic it seems that the
percentage of respondents practicing more than once per week (option #1) is systematically
decreasing. From 47.3% in 1995/96 and 37.1% in 1998/99 to 26.6% in 2007. In contrast, the
percentage of those attending the Church only on Sundays increases from 29.7% and 31.9% to
37.4%, and twice, three times a month from 9.8% and 14.5% to 20.1%. There was also a slight
increase in the number of no practitioners in general from 4.6% and 5.6% to 6.5%. The percentage
of practitioners practicing several times a year remains more or less stable (respectively: 8,6% and
11.1% and 8.6%).
This section of the results shows that more Rzeszów students in comparison with previous
studies prefer a moderate way of attending their church. The total percentage of regular visitors to
temples ("once a week and sometimes on weekdays" and "once a week") decreases from 77% in
1995 and 69% in 1998 to 64% (Grygiel 2002:286; Grzesik 2002:96). Although those numbers may
sound alarming it should not be expected the academic youth of Rzeszów will completely
disappear from their temples in the future. Nowadays, there are more options of spending free time
on the weekends and therefore spending this time for religious practices may be not that frequent
as in the late 20th century.
The next questions of the survey was trying to verify if religion is moving away from
morality (or vice versa) of Subcarpathia’ students. The first stage of its examination was to ask the
16

respondents about the instances deciding what is good and what is bad, the respondents had
following options to choose: God's law, society and human. The obtained results are presented in
Table 7.

It seems that, God's laws are on the first place on the second place and on the last place on
the individual and on the social level. The same rank of arrangement was observed in the research
conducted by Paweł Grygiel at the then WSP in Rzeszów in the academic year 1998/99 and slightly
earlier (1995/96) in the research conducted at the same university by Artur Grzesik (Grygiel
2002:377; Grzesik 2002:126). It should also be noted that in other studies conducted by Janusz

17

Mariański among high school graduates from six cities, the first place was taken by individual
criteria before religious and social criteria, only young people from Tarnów had the same
hierarchical structure as in this study (Mariański 1995:114). Therefore, it can be repeated,
following Paweł Grygel, that young people from south-eastern Poland are specifically oriented
towards religious justification of moral truths (Grygiel 2002:383).
The next stage of the survey of students' opinions on the relationship between relief and
morality was to learn the answers to the following question: "There are many different views on
the mutual relationship between religion and morality. Which one is closest to your own views?
Respondents chose one of the four options given in Table 8.
Table 8: Evaluation of the mutual relationship between religion and morality
# Responses
1 Only religion can justify legitimate moral
imperatives
2 For me, religion justifies my moral rules, but I
think it can be justified without it
3 I do not feel the need to justify morality by
religion, my own conscience is sufficient
4 I am not interested in this case

From the presented data so far, it can be seen that almost a half of the respondents recognize
religions as a translator of moral principles, at the same time believing that it can be done without
it. The second most frequently indicated answer was the third option, which puts one's own
conscience above that of religions. Third place was taken by the first option, strictly religious. It
can be seen that the majority of respondents declare religious morality (the sum of the first and
second answers), but the fact remains that almost half of them are tolerant of other world views
and ideas.
18

It is interesting to compare the obtained results with those from the research conducted by
Paweł Grygiel and Artur Grzesik. There is a clear decrease in persons declaring their morality
dependent on religion (from 24.0% in Artur Grzesik's studies and 21.2% in Paweł Grygiel's studies
to 14.4% in this study) and an increase in persons preferring the second option (from 45.5% and
45.8% to 49.6%). On the other hand, the percentage of respondents choosing the third answer
(24.2%, 28.4% and 26.6%) was similar and there was a clear increase in the number of people not
interested in the relationship between religion and morality (from 5.8% and 4.4% to 9.4%) (Grygiel
2002:374, Grzesik 2002:157). Therefore, religious morality, although still dominant among
Podkarpackie students, the absolute belief that it dominates over other world views is gaining less
and less supporters and it is rather difficult to believe that this state of affairs may change in the
future.
In order to clarify the above subject, academic youth were asked about their attitude
towards moral norms of a particular religion, or more precisely Catholicism. The obtained
distribution of answers is shown in Table 9.
Table 9: Attitudes towards moral principles of the Catholic religion
# List of Answers
1 The moral principles of Catholicism are the best and sufficient
morality
2 All the principles of Catholicism are legitimate, but in view of the
complexity of life they must be supplemented by some other
principles
3 Most of the moral principles of Catholicism are right, but I do not
agree with all of them, and moreover, those which are right are
certainly not enough for man
4 Religious morality is alien to me, but I consider some of the moral
principles of Catholicism to be correct
5 The moral principles of Catholicism are completely alien to me

After summing up the answers of the second and third answers from Table 9, it turns out
that the majority of the respondents only partially accept the moral rules of Catholicism (77%).
Therefore, in the opinion of the participants: the moral rules of Catholicism are correct but they
should be supplemented with other rules according to the requirements of everyday life. Only one
tenth of respondents believe that the morality of Catholicism is sufficient and the best morality,
and a similar number of respondents believe that the morality of Catholicism is partially or
completely alien to them.
Comparing the results to those of Grzesik (2002) and Grygiel (2002) research, we can see
that the percentage of people who approve of the first thesis, which is fully conducive to Catholic
principles, is decreasing from 24.8% in 1995/96 and 20.2% in 1998/99 to 12.9%. Moreover, the
percentage of respondents indicating second and third answers (meaning partial acceptance of
Catholic principles) increased from 70.7% and 72.8% to 77% and the percentage of respondents
approaching the moral norms of Catholicism with disapproval increased from 4.4% and 5.8% to
10% (cf. Grygiel 2002:394; Grzesik 2002:155). These results seems to show that the surveyed
students do not want their moral norms to be governed buy the most conservative beliefs.
To sum up the data presented so far, it seems that most of the respondents acknowledge
the roles of religious norms in deciding what is right and wrong. They do not think that religion
clearly dominates over morality. Moreover, despite the fact that religion is still important in
solving moral issues for the surveyed youth, its value weakened in comparison to previous years
(Grygiel 2002; Grzesik 2002).
The above examples of changes in the perception of religion in the lives of the studied
students encourage to check whether the religiousness of Subcarpathia youth is in fact going
through a crisis. To this end, the students were asked to finish the following part of the sentence:
20

"Your attitude towards religion in recent years...". The respondents could choose one answer from
several answers in table 10.

The results presented in Table 10 confirm the second hypothesis of this study that religion
is playing a weaker role in the lives of the Rzeszów students. The results of this survey research
were compared with the findings of Paweł Grygiel (2002) in Figure 1. The first striking difference
in the percentage of student who believe that their attitude towards religion did not change, 51.0%
of Grygiel’s responders believed that in 1999 but only 38.8% in 2007. The next big change can be
observed in the percentage of young people whose attitude towards religion has changed towards
less religiousness (from 18.8% to 38.1%).

The results showed in the Figure 1 show that Rzeszów students in 2007 experienced deeper
reflections about their religious beliefs than in 1999. As Katarzyna Leszczyńska pointed out, this
type of phenomenon can be observed among the majority of young Poles (2003:68). It is difficult
to judge whether it is a proof of secularization among students from Subcarpathia mainly because
of a relatively small sample of examined persons, but the data presented above encourage to
conduct further research on the relationship between morality and religion and religiousness itself.

Conclusion
The results of this survey study show that the moral choices of the academic youth of
Subcarpathia province are characterized by moderate relativism rather than total absolutism or
permissiveness. Most of the respondents are convinced that there is no absolutely right moral
system and moral choices are influenced by circumstances coming from certain situations.

22

Compared to earlier studies by Paweł Grygiel (2002) and Artur Grzesik (2002), the most
interesting situation is the decreasing role of religion in the lives of the Rzeszów’s students.
Responders in the academic year 2006/2007 show a lesser degree of approval for religion as an
instance justifying moral choices, and more than a third of the respondents believe that in recent
years their religiousness has been weakening. The observed process may have signs of
individualization of religion. Therefore, young people, although they define themselves as
believers, decide independently and individually which religious norms they accept and which
they reject. This trend of individualization of religion has been more and more clearly visible in
Polish society and among Western European societies. According to Mirosław Marody: "In the
case of beliefs, the process of their individualization (also often referred to as privatization) was
clearly marked, which was reflected both in the selectivity of religious beliefs in relation to the
binding church dogmas, as well as in their coexistence with beliefs that are part of the nonChristian belief system.” (2003:146). The results of this research confirms this claim. Particularly,
it seems important to ask about the legitimacy of Catholic moral principles, on which the following
opinion prevails among the respondents: most of the principles of Catholicism are legitimacy, but
they need to be supplemented about other things. Nevertheless, for the youth of Subcarpathia
region religion remains an important experience in everyday life, which is best confirmed by high
rates of self-declaration of faith and practice. In addition, the surveyed students do not show a
definite desire to separate what is moral from what is religious. Thus, it should be emphasized that
for Subcarpathia academic youth of the XXI century religion remains an important value and an
important factor influencing the judgement of what is good and what is bad.
