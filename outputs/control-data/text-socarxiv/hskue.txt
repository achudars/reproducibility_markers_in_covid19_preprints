Abstract
The Human Development Index, which reflects societies’ combined achievement in
education, health and standard of living, has since its introduction become the most famous
indicator of the level of development of societies. A disadvantage of this index is however,
that only national values are available, whereas within many countries huge subnational
variation in development exists. Here we present the Subnational Human Development
Index (SHDI), which shows within-country variation in human development across the
globe. Covering more than 1600 regions within 160 countries, the SHDI and its dimension
indices provide a ten times higher-resolution picture than was available before. Withincountry variation is particularly strong in low and middle developed countries and less
important in the most developed ones. Education disparities explain most SHDI inequality
within low-developed countries and standard of living differences within more highly
developed countries. With the SHDI, global socio-economic change can be studied with
unprecedented coverage and detail.

INTRODUCTION
Since 1990, the United Nations Development Program has reported on a yearly basis the
values of its flagship indicator: the Human Development Index (1). This HDI – which
indicates countries’ combined achievements in education, health and standard of living –
has become the key reference indicator to assess countries’ socio-economic performance, in
academic and policy-making circles (2 – 6), as well as in the broader community interested
in development issues. The simplicity of the index’s characterization of development,
linked to the basic message that development is about much more than growth, has
contributed to its popularity.
Despite its global success, the HDI has been criticized, among other issues, for not taking
into consideration distributional issues in its conceptualization (7 – 9). In particular, it has
been criticized for its neglect of differences within countries (10 – 12). While there are
multiple indications that subnational variation in human development can be substantial (8
– 14), until now it was not possible to study these differences for more than a handful of
countries. Here, we document for the first time within-country variation in human
development, using comparable units of analysis across the globe.
Our analysis is based on the Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI) Database
(15), which reports sub-national values of the HDI and its three subcomponents for more
than 1600 regions within 160 countries, covering above 99% of the world’s population.
Providing a ten times higher-resolution picture than was previously available, this source of
data opens the possibility of studying global socio-economic change with unprecedented
coverage and detail and increases the ability of policy-makers to monitor and achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals. Here we use this SHDI Database to report global trends in
human development inequality since the year 2000, to investigate how much of that
inequality can be attributable to differences occurring across or within countries and how
much is due to variation in the three subcomponents.
There is a huge literature on within- and between-country inequalities in income and nonincome dimensions of welfare. For example, many other studies have investigated subnational variation in education (16 – 18), health (19, 20), or income (21 – 24) across the
world or in some of its regions. The current study differs from the previous ones in
documenting global trends in education, health and standard of living simultaneously – thus
offering a unique opportunity to investigate how these factors have jointly evolved and
influenced each other over time.

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the new index across the globe in 2015. We see that
human development varies considerably, not only among but also within countries. The
finely grained scale of the SHDI allows identifying clusters of high, middle and low human
development that cut across national borders (e.g. the highly developed regions surrounding
the Alps, the middle-developed coastal regions in front of the Gulf of Guinea, or the least
developed regions in landlocked Sub-Saharan African countries).
In other cases, one can observe clear geographic patterns within countries (e.g. the NorthSouth divide in Belgium, Germany, Italy or Spain). Some countries exhibit huge regional
variations (e.g. China, India, or Colombia) while others are quite homogeneous (e.g.
Australia). Very often, the region where the capital city is located exhibits the highest
human development levels and remote rural regions the least.
[[[Figure 1: World Map]]]
Inequality trends
How has global inequality in SHDI and its three components evolved since the turn of the
century? In Figure 2, the Gini index for the global distribution of the SHDI and its three
sub-components is presented for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The Gini index is a
broadly-used inequality measure that runs from zero (complete equality) to one (maximum
inequality) (25). Figure 2 shows that the inequality in the global SHDI distribution has
monotonically decreased from 0.14 in 2000 to 0.11 fifteen years later. This reduction of
inequality has taken place against a backdrop of general improvements in human
development across and within countries.
Figure 2 also shows the trends in global inequality for the underlying health, education and
standard of living indices. While they are all decreasing, we observe substantial differences
in their magnitudes and speed of decline. According to the Gini index, differences in the
life expectancy index across world regions are smaller than differences in the education
index. The former declined from 0.09 in 2000 to 0.08 in 2015, whereas the latter went from
0.19 to 0.14 in the same period. Somewhere in between, inequality in the standard of living
index went from 0.16 to 0.12. As the more unequal indices showed a faster decline,
convergence is taking place towards the more equally distributed component (health).

Decomposition analysis
One of the most interesting features of the SHDI and its subcomponents is that we can
quantify the amount of inequality that can be attributed to differences occurring between
and within countries. In Figure 3 we show the percentages of total inequality that can be
attributed to within-country differences in the world as a whole and in the groups of ‘Low’,
‘Medium’ and ‘High’ developed countries in 2015 (the results for 2000 are available in the
Supplementary Materials Figure S1). These percentages can be seen as the amount of ‘new’
inequality that is revealed by using a subnational index.
Most striking in Figure 3 is the very high contribution of within-country inequality to total
inequality in the groups of countries at low and intermediate levels of development (where
as much as 70 percent of the world population lives). In these groups of countries, about
half of inequality in SHDI is within country inequality. Stated otherwise: when switching
from national HDI to subnational SHDI, the amount of inequality we observe in low and
middle developed countries doubles. Among the high developed countries, within-country
inequality is less important and most SHDI inequality is explained by differences between
countries.
[[[Figure 3: % contribution of within country inequality]]]
A rather similar pattern is observed when inspecting the three subcomponents of the SHDI
separately (see Figure 3). Once again, the percentage of total inequality in education, health
and standard of living that can be attributed to within-country inequality is relatively small
for the group of high developed countries (contributions hovering around 10% and 15%),
but is much larger – and generally increasing – for low and, particularly, for medium
developed countries (with contributions often approaching or even surpassing the threshold
of 50%). In those regions, the newly found within country differences in education, health
and standard of living carry about the same weight as the (already well-investigated)
differences across countries.
The three subcomponents
Moving forward, one might wonder how much of the newly discovered HDI inequality
within countries can be attributed to differences in education, health and standard of living.
Figure 4 plots for the groups of low, medium and high-developed countries, the
contribution of the health (H), education (E) and standard of living (S) subcomponents to
SHDI inequality within countries (the Supplementary Materials section explains how to
perform such decompositions). The upper, middle and lower panels show the results. Each
dot in these ternary plots represents the three contributions for a specific country-year

4

combination. The closer a dot is to a given vertex, the more important the corresponding
subcomponent (H, E or S) is in explaining SHDI inequality within countries.
[[[Figure 4: triangles]]]
In the least developed countries, we observe that most observations (69%) are located near
the education vertex (E). This means that in those countries, within-country SHDI
inequality is mostly due to variation in education. At the intermediate level of development,
education is still most important in explaining within-country variation, but the influence of
standard of living is growing (52% of points have E as its closest vertex, and 33% of points
are closest to the S vertex). In the high developed countries, standard of living surpasses
education as the most important explanatory factor for within country SHDI variation (50%
of the points have S as its nearest vertex in the lower panel). For all three groups of
countries, differences in the health component tend to be least important. Its influence is
relatively strongest at the intermediate level of development (with 15% of points nearest to
H) and weakest in the most developed countries (with only 5% nearest to H).
DISCUSSION
By introducing subnational variation, we obtain a richer and more comprehensive picture of
the global differences in human development. The findings reported in this paper suggest
that the SHDI distribution is characterized by (i) global inequality declines in human
development and in its three subcomponents, (ii) large contributions of within-country
inequality to overall inequality for the low and middle developed countries, and (iii)
relatively small differences across subnational regions within highly developed countries.
Our analyses reveal that variation in human development within countries can be as large as
variation across countries in vast regions of the world. This implies that national-level
aggregates such as the United Nations’ Human Development Index conceal huge
inequalities within low and middle developed countries (home of 70% of the global
population). While between-country inequality is still an important source of global
variation in human development, within-country variability has gained increasing
prominence during the last decades.
These patterns complement recent findings reported in global inequality studies (16, 17, 19
– 23). They are opposite to the long-established trends of ever-expanding between-country
inequality, that date back as far as the early stages of the Industrial Revolution (17, 22, 23,
26). The shifting composition of human development inequality across and within countries
implies that national location – while still of great importance – is losing prominence as a
determining factor of individuals’ well-being. The implications of this change, which are

5

multifarious and far-reaching, will shape the 21st century agenda of social scientists and
policy-makers concerned with global distributive justice.
The data on the SHDI and its components is freely accessible in
https://hdi.globaldatalab.org/. This provides researchers worldwide with high-detail
contextual variables that can be used to improve our understanding in wide-ranging areas of
the social sciences (including, but not limited to, the study of family formation and fertility
behavior, migration, health and mortality, epidemiology, cultural/ideational/normative
change, religion, socio-economic change, or environmental sustainability). In the policymaking arena, the subnational SHDI is very pertinent for the global development agenda,
which is committed to ‘improve health and education’, ‘economic growth’ and ‘reduce
poverty and inequalities between and within countries’ (i.e. Sustainable Development Goals
#1, #3, #4, #8 and #10). With the SHDI and its indices, problem areas with respect to these
SDGs can be detected so that resources can be directed to the places where they are mostly
needed.
Moving beyond country-level averages, the SHDI has the potential to bring equity concerns
to the fore, and to serve as a key tool to articulate national and international development
policies into a coherent whole.
Limitations
Some limitations of this study should be highlighted. First, like any composite index, both
the HDI and its subnational version discussed here are restricted in their scope. Although of
great importance, the three dimensions included in the (S)HDI, are among other dimensions
of well-being (e.g. environmental sustainability, gender equality, political freedom). Also
the way in which the information is aggregated (i.e. the choice of dimensional weights and
aggregation functions) could be chosen differently (27 – 33). Despite these restrictions, the
HDI has played a fundamental role during the last decades to raise awareness that
‘development is much more than economic growth’ (4). Analogously, the new SHDI can be
an extremely useful tool to remind that, besides high average levels of achievement, an
equitable distribution of these achievements across populations is also a fundamental
development goal.
Second, several data points in the SHDI Database have been estimated using different
techniques. Missing data points have been filled using interpolation and extrapolation
techniques and missing sub-national observations for the health and standard of living
components have been estimated on the basis of under 5 mortality rates and the
International Wealth Index (IWI), respectively (details given in the Materials and Methods
section). The analyses performed in (15) demonstrate that the measurement error that
entails from such estimation techniques is restricted. The estimated relative errors for inter
6

and extrapolation are quite small and the fit of the models to estimate the health and
standard of living components is very good (with R2s around 89% and 83%). Hence, while
measurement errors could somewhat affect the SHDI estimates for specific sub-national
regions, it is unlikely that they would distort the overall trends reported in this article.
Third, the results presented in this paper uncover sub-national variation in human
development at the level of the main administrative units of each country. With on average
about ten regions per country, this is a great step forwards compared to the national indices
used until now. However, given that the regions generally are still rather large, probably a
substantial amount of inequality in SHDI remains concealed. Our figures therefore only
provide a lower bound to SHDI inequality, and total global inequality is likely to be higher.
Some exploratory analysis performed for the cases of Mexico (13) and Brazil (34) with a
municipal-level HDI suggest that variations within countries’ main administrative units can
be potentially substantial. However, while greater geographical detail (e.g. municipalities
(13) or small-scale grids (18, 24)) can be obtained for specific countries, this is obtained at
the cost of losing comparability and missing the global picture. In addition, concepts like
regional life expectancy, educational performance or standard of living can lose their
meaning if the region becomes too small. The major strength of the current study is that –
for the first time – subnational variations in the HDI and its subcomponents are documented
in a strictly comparable way for virtually all countries of our world.

Materials and Methods
All the details on how the SHDI Database has been constructed can be found in (15), which
can be downloaded from https://hdi.globaldatalab.org/areadata/about-shdi/. In this section,
we summarize the key points and refer the interested reader to that paper for further details.
Methodologically, the SHDI is a translation of UNDP’s official HDI (hdr.undp.org) to the
subnational level. As such, it is an average of the subnational values of three basic
dimensions: ‘Education’, ‘Health’ and ‘Standard of living’. The specific indicators used in
their definition include ‘Mean years of schooling of adults aged 25+’, ‘Expected years of
schooling of children aged 6’, ‘Life expectancy at birth’ and ‘Gross National Income per
capita (PPP, 2011 US$)’. These indices are measured using a variety of data sources,
ranging from censuses to socio-economic and demographic household surveys. More
specifically, the Subnational Human Development Index Database was created on the basis
of three data sources: (i) statistical offices, including Eurostat, the statistical office of the
European Union, (ii) the Area Database of the Global Data Lab, GDL-AD,

7

(www.globaldatalab.org/areadata) and (iii) the HDI database of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP, https://hdr.undp.org/data).
In countries where the required indicators are not available at a subnational level, we
estimate them using available information on related indicators. More specifically,
subnational life expectancy and GNI per capita have been estimated from information on
under 5 mortality (U5M) and the International Wealth Index (IWI, see (35)), respectively.
In both cases, separate regression models were constructed that explained the variation of
our variable of interest (i.e. life expectancy and GNI per capita) at the national level
(obtained from the UNDP database) on the basis of national U5M and IWI scores derived
from GDL-AD. We compared models with linear and nonlinear effects based on their
adjusted R2 and chose the model with the best fit. In the case of life expectancy, the
selected model explained 89% of the variance, and in the case of GNI per capita, 83%.
To ensure consistency with national HDI values, the subnational indicators are constructed
in such a way that their averages correspond to the official values published by UNDP.
Using the later as reference points, we fill missing country-year information using
interpolation and extrapolation techniques. In (15), details are given on (i) the extent of
inter- and extrapolation performed on the SHDI Dataset, and (ii) the estimation of the
relative error derived from the adoption of these techniques. Overall, the share of highquality estimates (i.e. real observations, or short term inter- or extrapolations) increases
over time, and the size of the relative errors tends to be smaller than the ones reported in
analogous studies, e.g. (36). With the implementation of a consistent methodology, we
obtain a simple measure spanning from 2000 to 2015 that is internationally comparable
across more than 1600 regions in 160 countries, covering over 99% of the world
population.
To compute the Subnational Human Development Index, we first estimate the education,
health and standard of living subcomponents (𝐸𝑖 , 𝐻𝑖 , 𝑆𝑖 ) and scale them between 0 and 1
(see Supplementary Materials section for details). Mimicking the most recent definition of
UNDP’s HDI, the Subnational Human Development Index for each subnational area ‘𝑖’ is
defined as
𝑆𝐻𝐷𝐼𝑖𝑚 = 3√𝐻𝑖 𝐸𝑖 𝑆𝑖

[1]

This is the geometric mean of the three sub-components (the superscript ‘𝑚’ stands for
‘multiplicative’). In this way, one avoids perfect substitutability between the health,
education and standard of living dimensions and penalizes those regions with very unequal
achievements across components. Like the original HDI, the SHDI takes values between 0
and 1 (the former is reached whenever one of the three components attains the lowest
8

possible level of 0 and the latter when all three components attain the maximal level of 1).
While not attempted in this paper, it is also possible to construct the additive version of the
SHDI with the information available in the SHDI Database.
To measure the extent of global inequality in the SHDI and its sub-components, we have
used two well-known inequality measures: the Gini index and the Mean Log Deviation.
These measures have been chosen for their popularity and their well-known
decomposability properties. The Mean Log Deviation allows decomposing global SHDI
inequality in its within-country and between country components, and the Gini index can be
used to assess how much of the SHDI inequality in a given country can be attributable to
the education, health or standard of living components (details and formal definitions are
given in the Supplementary Materials section).

Figure 3. Percent contribution of within country inequality to total inequality for the
SHDI and its three subcomponents in different groups of countries (year 2015). To
measure the within-country contribution we have used the Mean Log Deviation as
inequality measure (which is additively decomposable and is very highly correlated with
the values of the Gini index – see Supplementary Information section). To define whether a
country belongs to the group of Low, Medium or Highly developed countries we look at its
HDI in year 2008 (the middle of the observation period). If such HDI is below (resp. above)
0.55 (resp. 0.7) the country belongs to the set of Low (resp. High) developed countries.
Whenever it falls between 0.55 and 0.7, it is a Medium developed country. The shares of
the world population in Low, Medium and High developed countries are 20%, 50% and
30%, respectively. The 50% horizontal line indicates the threshold above which the withincountry component of inequality contributes more to total inequality than the betweencountry one. Source: Authors’ elaboration based on information from the Global Data Lab.

dimensions to SHDI inequality within countries by level of development. The upper,
middle and lower panels show the contributions for the groups of Low, Medium and High
developed countries, respectively. Explanations of how to estimate the contribution of each
indicator are given in the Supplementary Materials. Ternary plots show the contribution of
the three components to SHDI inequality within each country: the position of each dot with
respect to the vertices helps understanding how important the education, health and
standard of living subcomponents are. The closer a dot is to a given vertex (say, E, H or S),
the more important the corresponding subcomponent is. A hypothetical point in the middle
of the triangle would represent a case where the three subcomponents contributed equally
to observed SHDI inequality in a specific country. Another point near the top of the triangle
would represent a case where most of the SHDI inequality would be explained by the
standard of living component. The numbers inside the triangles indicate the percentage of
observations that are closest to the E, H or S vertices. Source: Authors’ elaboration based

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS

The SHDI Database used in this paper contains subnational data for 1621 regions in 160
countries, that cover all areas and development levels across the globe. This is a big step
forwards, especially for low and middle income countries (LMICs). Until recently there
was hardly any subnational data for these countries available. The subnational data for
LMICs used in the current research is to a large extent derived from the Global Data Lab
(www.globaldatalab.org), which recently has released its GDL Area Database from where a
broad range of subnational development indicators can be downloaded for over 120 LMICs
(37). Much of the data for LMICs that we use to construct the SHDI was obtained from this
GDL Area Database. For high-income countries and some middle-income countries, the
data was derived from statistical offices, including Eurostat, the statistical office of the
European Union. The SHDI was constructed in such a way that its national values are equal
to the values of the official HDI of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The
national data used for making this connection were derived from the UNDP HDI Database
(hdr.undp.org/data).
Dimension indices
To compute the SHDI and its three subcomponents on the basis of the data we assembled,
exactly the same methodology is used as the one employed by UNDP in the construction of
the national HDI (38). The education sub-index is computed as ((𝐸𝑌𝑆⁄18) ·
1⁄2

(𝑀𝑌𝑆⁄15)) , where 𝐸𝑌𝑆 and 𝑀𝑌𝑆 are the expected and mean years of schooling,
respectively. The health sub-index is computed as (𝑒0 − 20)⁄(85 − 20), where 𝑒0 is the
life expectancy at birth. Thirdly, the standard of living sub-index is computed as
(𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐺𝑁𝐼𝑝𝑐) − 𝑙𝑜𝑔(100))⁄(𝑙𝑜𝑔(75000) − 𝑙𝑜𝑔(100)), where 𝐺𝑁𝐼𝑝𝑐 is the Gross
National Income per capita (2011 PPP $). Lastly, as shown in the main text (see equation
[1]), the SHDI is computed as the geometric mean of the education, health and standard of
living sub-indices (the use of the arithmetic mean to generate an additive SHDI does not
alter the main findings of the paper). Further details on materials and methods can be found
in (15).
Measuring inequality
The extent of inequality in a given distribution can be measured using many different
indices (see, for instance, (25)). In this paper, we use two of the most popular inequality
measures: the Gini index (𝐺) and the Mean Log Deviation (𝐿). For a given distribution 𝒙 =
(𝑥1 , ⋯ , 𝑥𝑛 ) with 𝑥𝑖 ≥ 0 for all 𝑖, the Gini index is defined as

17

𝐺(𝑥1 , ⋯ , 𝑥𝑛 ) =

∑𝑖 ∑𝑗|𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥𝑗 |
2𝑛2 𝜇

[𝐸𝑄1]

where 𝜇 is the mean of the 𝒙 distribution. The Gini index takes values between 0 and 1.
When there is no variation and all observations are the same, 𝐺 = 0. In the extreme case
where all observations except one are zero (i.e. ‘one individual owes everything and the
others are left empty-handed’), 𝐺 = 1.
The Mean Log Deviation is defined as
𝐿(𝒙) =

1
𝜇
∑ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( )
𝑛
𝑥𝑖

[𝐸𝑄2]

𝑖

Like the Gini index, 𝐿 takes a value of 0 whenever there is no variation and all observations
coincide. Unlike the Gini index, 𝐿 is unbounded: the higher its values, the higher the
corresponding level of inequality.
Decomposing inequality
In order to decompose overall inequality in its within- and between-country components,
we use the Mean Log Deviation, which belongs to the class of Generalized Entropy
Measures. The reason why we have not used the Gini index in the decomposition is that,
unlike 𝐿, the former cannot be neatly broken down into a within- and between-country
component. Yet, the correlation between the values of the Gini index and the Mean Log
Deviation for the distributions analyzed in this paper is extremely high (i.e. around 0.99).
The Mean Log Deviation is well known for its additive decomposability property.
Assuming our distribution is split across several groups (as is the case with the SHDI
distribution, where subnational regions are included within countries), overall inequality
can be neatly decomposed as
𝐿(𝒙) = 𝐿𝐵 (𝒙) + 𝐿𝑊 (𝒙)

[𝐸𝑄3]

where 𝐿𝐵 is the inequality between countries and 𝐿𝑊 is the inequality within countries. The
between-country component is obtained assuming that each subnational attainment is the
same as the average attainment of the country to which the region belongs and the withincountry component is a population-weighted average of the subnational inequality within
countries. Formally,

𝐿𝑊 (𝒙) = ∑ 𝑝𝑗 𝐿𝑗

[𝐸𝑄5]

𝑗=1

where 𝐽 is the number of countries and 𝑝𝑗 , 𝜇𝑗 and 𝐿𝑗 are the population share, the mean and
the Mean Log Deviation observed in country 𝑗, respectively. The percent contribution of
within-country inequality to total inequality reported in Figure 3 is simply the quantity
100𝐿𝑊 (𝒙)⁄𝐿 (𝒙), which can be interpreted as the amount of ‘new’ inequality that is
revealed by the subnational SHDI.
Contribution of the three components to within country SHDI inequality
The SHDI is an average of its three basic components. To reduce inequality in SHDI most
effectively, it is important to know the exact contribution of the three components to the
observed SHDI inequality levels. To estimate these contributions, methods can be used that
have been developed in the economics literature to study the contribution of different
income sources to total income inequality (e.g.: (39) or (40)). For these methods to work in
our framework we need to use the additive version of the Subnational Human Development
Index (which is very highly correlated with its multiplicative version). For a given
subnational region ′𝑖′, let 𝑌𝑖 , 𝐻𝑖 , 𝐸𝑖 and 𝑆𝑖 be the corresponding subnational human
development, health, education and standard of living indices. In case of additive human
development indices we have that
𝑌𝑖 =

𝐻𝑖 𝐸𝑖 𝑆𝑖
+ +
3
3 3

[𝐸𝑄6]

The distribution of subnational human development, health, education and standard of
living indices will be denoted as Y, H, E and S respectively. Following (40), if the human
development distribution is ordered so that 𝑌1 ≤ 𝑌2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝑌𝑛 , then the corresponding Gini
index can be written as
𝑛

𝑛+1
𝐺(𝑌) = 2 ∑ (𝑖 −
) 𝑌𝑖
𝑛 𝜇𝑦

[𝐸𝑄7]

where 𝑛 is the number of regions and𝜇𝑦 is the mean of the human development
distribution. Plugging equation [EQ6] into equation [EQ7] we obtain

which are known as the pseudo-Gini’s for factors H, E and S respectively (see (39,40)).
This way of rewriting the Gini coefficient provides a natural additive decomposition rule
where the contributions of the different sources are clearly established.

Percent contribution of within-country inequality to total inequality in 2000.
In order to investigate how the contribution of within-country inequality to total inequality
has evolved over time, in Figure S1 we show the analogue of Figure 3 (which shows the
values corresponding to year 2015) for the year 2000. The contribution of within-country
inequality to total inequality in year 2000 was considerably high for the groups of low and,
particularly, middle developed countries (home of 70% of the world’s population). In
general, we see that such contributions have tended to increase over time – except for the
group of highly developed countries, where they have tended to remain at relatively low
levels. Considering all world countries together as a single entity (i.e. “All countries”), we
observe increases in the contribution of within-country inequality for the SHDI and its three
basic sub-components from 2000 to 2015. Such increase in the contribution of the withincountry inequality components has gone in tandem with declines in the levels of inequality
for the SHDI and its sub-indices (see main paper’s Figure 2).

Figure S1. Percent contribution of within country inequality to total inequality for the
SHDI and its three subcomponents in different groups of countries (year 2000). To
define whether a country belongs to the group of Low, Medium or Highly developed
countries we look at its HDI in year 2008 (the middle of the observation period). If such
HDI is below (resp. above) 0.55 (resp. 0.7) the country belongs to the set of Low (resp.
High) developed countries. Whenever it falls between 0.55 and 0.7, it is a Medium
developed country. Source: Authors’ elaboration based on information from the Global
