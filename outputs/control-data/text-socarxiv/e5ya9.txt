Abstract
The combination between technology and education has given birth to a new form of assessment
called: e-assessment. The latter assesses learners using different digital means one of which are
social media. The present study investigated the impact of social media, as being one aspect of eassessment tools, on EFL students’ written production. It tried to highlight the nature of this
impact, enquired about the reasons behind their writing difficulties, and explored whether these
errors were caused by social media or not. This research work relied on a case study that consisted
of 31 third-year undergraduates and 22 English teachers at the department of English at Tlemcen
University, Algeria. The data were gathered through the use of two questionnaires administered
to both learners and instructors plus two writing tasks, one assigned on social media and the other
in the classroom. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively through error analysis. After
identifying the different errors produced by the students, the findings revealed that a relationship
existed between learners’ use of social media and their writing issues. Their intensive use of social
media led to a significant decrease in the writing level of the learners who have developed a new
form of writing that includes linguistic habits which reflect the informalities often found on a
social media environment, and do not necessarily follow the norms and rigours of the English
language. They have become unable to distinguish between the formal and informal context to the
point that certain linguistic aspects have become fossilized.

Introduction
Today’s connected world has witnessed a radical change that has gathered people around the globe
closer regardless of distance. Moreover, the tremendous development made in the field of ICT’s,
that resulted from globalization, has brought a digital age that keeps surging and advancing. This
digital age led to the development of new concepts such as digital literacy which urges individuals
to have background knowledge about computers and smart phones; a knowledge that has become
necessary in order to cope with the needs of the contemporary society.
Mobile phones and computers have not only impacted the way people interact with each
other, but also the society as a whole. This effect is what is known as social media. The latter have
become introduced in the EFL classroom and have allowed instructors to digitally assess their
learners through using them as an innovative teaching tool. Their integration has radically changed
not only the way students learn, but also the way they are assessed.

Despite their advantages, these social networking sites have created a sort of addiction that
resulted in a decline of the students’ writing abilities. Research about this phenomenon has raised
some concerns in the last few years, and has attracted the attention of many researchers who have
long investigated the impact of social media on learners’ writing, and attempted to find the most
suitable solutions to this issue.
Literature Review
Knight (2009) defines e-assessment as the latest form of assessment that relies on technology for
the sake of elaborating, storing, recording and grading learners’ assignments and answers by means
of digital devices which can be computers, mobile phones or tablets. Crisp (2011) mentions the
several means employed to assess students including: wikis, blogs, self or peer review and social
media. The latter refer to those 2.0 websites and applications that result in what is called a webbased technology i.e., a communication through the use of the internet. They enable the internet
user to create his own content and share it with his friends or followers (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010).
Trottier & Fuchs (2014) consider social media as being the unification of several types of media
and ICT’s in what is referred to as a platform of communication. Wigmore (2015) describes them
as being a group of connected media of communication utilized by the population for various
reasons such as discussions, exchanges and cooperation.
Social media are traced back to the late 2000’s and since then their popularity has kept
growing. They are a popular means of interaction employed by a number of companies and various
institutions as well as millions of people all over the world who consider them as an essential part
of their everyday life. They allow individuals, who share the same interests, to discuss online with
each other; to comment, and exchange data, thoughts, news, pictures and videos, to find friends
and relatives, or to take part in online communities. These operations occur by creating a profile,
either private or public, and a personal account with one’s information (Ellison, 2007; Brown &
Vaughn, 2011).
Crystal (2004) mentions the variety of names that are found in the literature to refer to the
new type of language that emerged from the internet such as digitalk, textism, netspeak, textspeak
or techspeak. According to Riley (2013), the rapid growth of ICT’s has led to a new way of

interaction on the internet: a digital communication which is represented in the reliance on
emoticon, informal writing as well as nonstandard punctuation and capitalization when updating a
status on Facebook, for instance.
In fact, a change in the learners’ writing has been witnessed by lecturers who assume that
social media are responsible for their writing difficulties, and confirm the drop of the students’
writing abilities. There are different types of errors; some of them are due to social media and have
led to the elaboration of a variety of models of error analysis like the one put forward by Crystal
(2001). He claims that there is a variety of new non-standard English spellings which are witnessed
in chat groups or virtual world games. They are mainly influenced by speech and represent the
youth’s language in virtual words.
Based on Crystal’s (2001) model, other researchers like Varnhagen et al. (2010) advocate
the creation of a new type of the English language on instant messaging, and have developed a
model of error analysis. Their model includes: shortcuts which, on their own, imply insider words
that are highly informal and inappropriate, phonetic transcriptions that resemble speech,
contractions that combine nouns with other nouns or with verbs, lower case that comprises writing
proper nouns in small letters, abbreviations, word combinations, acronyms, alphabet or letters in
writing, pragmatic devices which embrace emotion words, contractions, acronyms, upper case i.e.,
writing all the word items into capital letters, misspelling of some words and typographical errors
that occur when typing on the keyboard.
Methodology
In order to assess the impact of social media, as being one instance of e-assessment tools, on EFL
students’ written production, a case study was relied on. It was geared by the following research
question:
1-How do social media affect EFL students’ written production?
2-What are the reasons behind the ill-formed sentences produced by the students?
The mentioned research questions led to the formulation of the following research hypotheses:
1-Social media affect students negatively, so that they use an informal lexicon and make
grammar and spelling mistakes.
2-The long exposure to social media leads to the process of fossilisation which can be
harmful to their acquisition of the structure of the foreign language.
To answer these research questions, the researcher administered two questionnaires for both
lecturers and students at the department of English at Tlemcen University, Algeria.
Participants
The participants, who were selected for this case study, were thirty-one third-year EFL learners at
the department of English at Tlemcen University. They were undergraduate students who were
studying English for three years, so that they could get their Licence degree by the end of the year.
The other informants consisted of 22 English teachers at the department English at Tlemcen
University. They held either a Doctorate or a Magister degree, and were teaching various modules.

Their selection was due to the fact that they were all concerned with students’ writing issues as
they corrected essays in the exams or tests.
Data Collection
To better investigate and identify the informants’ opinions about the impact of social media on
EFL learners’ written production, two questionnaires were delivered for both students and
educators at the department of English at Tlemcen University along with two writing tasks. One
was provided to the learners on Facebook, and the other one in the classroom. The researcher
analysed their pieces of writing later on by means of error analysis by following Varnhagen et al.
(2010) model which was explained previously. The choice of the topics for the two writing tasks
was deliberate since they were easy, general and at the reach of the students’ level to enable both
weak and good students to write.
Teacher’s Questionnaire
The questionnaire was designed for the sake of investigating instructors’ views about the effect of
social media on EFL learners’ written production as well as the reasons behind their errors. It was
administered to 22 professors, and contained eleven questions involving both close-ended and
open- ended questions (See Appendix A).
Students’ Questionnaire
The questionnaire was designed in order to assess the effect of social media on EFL learners’
written production. It was administered to third year Licence students. It contained eleven
questions moving from close ended ones, which comprise yes/no and multiple choice questions,
to open ended ones (See Appendix B). The questionnaire was administered by the researcher who
explained the questions and was present for further insights along with the responsible teacher.
Writing Task on Facebook
In order to have a concrete example of the students’ writing, directly from social media, the
researcher created a group page on Facebook, named: ‘Writing Activity’. It implied thirteen thirdyear learners who were asked to write paragraphs about four different topics: something that
interests them or they are fond of, their experiences at the university, the Algerians’ desire to flee
their country, and their problems in making research. The researcher selected Facebook instead of
the other social media because of its popularity among learners and its large availability. The
duration of the task was three weeks. It was conducted in the form of debates, for the same of
allowing the researchers notice instantly the variety of errors produced by the students. In order to
compare the students’ writing on social media and in the classroom, the researcher relied on an inclass writing task.
In-Class Writing Task
This research tool consisted of writing a formal essay on the difficulties that they encountered in
learning English. The task was explained by the researcher, with the presence of the responsible
teacher; it lasted one hour and was held in the classroom. It was not scored because the purpose
was not to quantify the types of errors made by the students but rather qualify them through the
use of error analysis. The aim of the in-class writing task was to see whether the students would
have recourse to the same writing style in the classroom and on Facebook or not.

Results
After gathering the necessary data, the researchers shift to the obtained results from each research
instrument.
Results of Teachers’ Questionnaire
All the informants claimed that their learners faced difficulties in writing. 68% considered their
learners’ writing level as being weak, and the remaining 32% believed that it was average. The
respondents provided several answers for the question about the causes of the students’ writing
problems. Some pointed out that the low English proficiency, which is represented in the lack of
reading, vocabulary and grammatical knowledge, as one of the reasons behind their issues. They
maintained that this deficiency in the mastery of grammatical rules resulted in their ignorance of
the sentence structure and paragraph writing. It was also due to the fact that they did not have
writing strategies, lacked practice, and were influenced by social media and the excessive texting.
Others proposed a variety of factors like laziness, lack of motivation, interest and concentration.
These elements pushed them to make silly mistakes of inattention. A minority believed that
teachers did not provide an adequate feedback to students with the correction of their errors so as
to help them to be aware of their mistakes.
Regarding the causes of the errors made by students in writing, the results demonstrated
that the majority of lecturers agreed that fossilization was the major cause of students’ errors. The
rest of them were divided between the mother tongue interference and overgeneralization, while
the remaining supported hypercorrection as shown in figure 1:

64% of the tutors mentioned the non-use of social media with their students; whereas, 36% claimed
that they employed them mainly for educational purposes in order to answer their questions;
exchange reading materials such as documents, books and useful links, videos or for supervision
sessions of Master and Doctorate students. The other reasons were for communicative purposes or
for being updated. Regarding the effect of social media on EFL students’ writing production, some
considered that they negatively affected it, and encouraged learners to use abbreviations,
acronyms, slang words, spelling mistakes, symbols, slips, contracted forms and punctuation
mistakes, and to neglect grammatical rules and miss-conjugate tenses. They argued that students
acquired these bad writing habits from the overuse of social media which has led to the fossilisation
of their mistakes. Others considered them to be a beneficial way to improve students’ writing, and

instead of using them for entertainment ends, they suggested to have an educational social media
based platform that boils down to activities related to the planning and operations of writing in
order to improve learners’ level. This will help them to rely on themselves and develop their own
learning autonomy.

Figure 6. Students’ use of slang words
and abbreviations on social media
When asked about the reasons of their informality in writing, a variety of causes were mentioned.
They considered that the informal writing was fast and a gain of time, easy to use and helpful to
express themselves. They believed that it was more suitable when chatting with close friends or
relatives. They also argued that it gave them more freedom in writing in contrast to the formal one
that obliged them to follow the strict rules
Concerning the effects of social media on their writing, divergent views were provided.
Some respondents believed that they had a positive influence rather than a negative one, and helped
them improve their writing abilities. They claimed that social media created an interactive way of
learning in which they were immersed in an environment they are already accustomed to in their
daily life. Others, on the other hand, were against this idea. They put forward their negative effect,
and asserted that they got accustomed to an informal writing on social media that affected their
writing abilities.
Results of the Writing Tasks
The researcher designed two writing tasks, one on Facebook and the other in the classroom. The
aim behind doing so was to compare the writing in the two contexts. The researcher then analysed

students’ pieces of writing through errors analysis following Varnhagen et al. (2010) model of
error analysis. The errors were classified according to each category as shown in tables 1 and 2
(See Appendix C).
Table 1 exposes pieces of students’ writing that were taken from the writing task on
Facebook. One can notice that students overused abbreviations, acronyms, emotion punctuation
and emotion words that reflected the social media environment. They respected neither
punctuation nor spelling, and relied heavily on the alphabet or letter as well as the phonetic
spelling.
Table 2 deals with the in-class writing task. It demonstrates that most of the learners made
an increasing number of syntactic and spelling mistakes, in addition to the lack of punctuation.
Despite the fact that they relied on the dictionary during the task, and the researcher emphasized
on writing a formal essay, their pieces of writing were full of informal expressions, contractions,
abbreviations as well as alphabets or letters.
Other elements were classified in table 3 which illustrates some mistakes that were noticed
by the researcher in the in-class writing task, and were not highlighted in the model that was
adopted previously.

The errors highlighted in table 3 further confirmed the learners’ difficulties in writing. They had
the tendency to write the same way they spoke in their mother tongue, and to rely on erroneous
and ill structured sentences. Another issue was the interference of the French language. This
interference was so deeply rooted that they were unable to differentiate between the two spellings.
Furthermore, other elements like repetition as well as the lack of cohesion and coherence were
also witnessed.
Discussion
The collected data from the questionnaires revealed that the totality of students had access to social
media creating a sort of addiction, mainly to Facebook, which was reflected in the fact that they
spend a long period of time using it. This dependence was harmful and affected their writing
abilities; an assumption confirmed by the professors who were aware of their writing issues when
correcting their exam papers, and pointed out the students' weak level in writing. In fact, the

extensive usage of social media divulgated the students' lack of mastery of the systemic language,
insufficient reading and effortless work that were behind their low linguistic proficiency and the
non-respect of the English language norms. This supposition was noticed in the online writing task
as well as the essays which were full of syntactic and spelling errors. While the majority mentioned
the negative effect of social media, a minority of educators and learners; however, put forward
their positive effect, and believed that they acted as a means to enhance their writing abilities. This
assumption partially confirms the first hypothesis which stated that social media affected students
negatively, pushed them to use an informal lexicon, and to make grammatical and spelling
mistakes.
The friendly and relaxing environment of social media encouraged students to write
through abbreviations, symbols, acronyms and slang words, for facilitative purposes, thus leading
to an informal language that best characterized the social media context. The influence of social
media rendered them unable to differentiate between a formal setting and an informal one. They
completely lost the notion of the register of the written language, and wrote in a text message type.
In other words, the effect of speech on writing led them to write in the classroom the same way
they would write or speak with their friends. Some informal words and expressions, that were
written in the writing task on Facebook, were also found in the essays. These informalities in
writing could be accepted in a Facebook context, but are inappropriate from an academic
perspective. Throughout time, some spellings, expressions or grammatical structures become a
habit in the learners’ writing style and therefore fossilized.
These findings confirmed the second hypothesis that stipulated that the long exposure to
social media leads to the process of fossilization, and damages the acquisition of the structure of
the foreign language. The results also highlighted the interference of both the mother tongue as
well as French language on the foreign one. This led to a mixture of the three languages at the
same time, and the occurrence of a sociolinguistic phenomenon called: code switching.
Recommendations
As recommendations to improve learners’ writing abilities and reduce the negative effects of social
media, the teacher can integrate a reading session within his course. Learners choose an interesting
book about their favourite author, summarize it, and make a discussion or a debate with their
classmates later on. This extensive reading session will create a joy of reading that will help them
develop their writing skill, reduce their spelling and syntactic mistakes, learn new lexicon and
cultures, expend their knowledge, and see how the language is formed and how the different words
are combined together to make meaning (Day, 2008).
Another alternative would be the reliance on video games. In this vein, Reinders (2009)
suggests the introduction of free virtual games like “the Sims” or “Second Life” in the EFL
classroom. Since the latter imply the creation of characters, learners can write paragraphs in which
they describe their look, their roles, and explain the selection of gender, race or dressing. They
have also the possibility to write to their classmates, within the game, by means of chats. He also
suggests that they could write stories in which they imagine ideas of games with their own vision,
creativity and imagination.

Since the findings revealed the learners’ wants to have recourse to social media for
educational purposes, Aydin (2014) speaks about the f-portfolio which is an online portfolio
delivered by the teacher via Facebook. He highlights its benefits in improving the learners’
linguistic competence, content knowledge as well as reading and writing skills. It is a time saving
method that enables instructors to collect writing samples and brainstorm their ideas on Facebook.
It leads to the rapid access, storage and reception of materials, and exchange of feedback between
teachers and peers so as to enhance the students’ learning outcomes.
Conclusion
The research findings revealed that social media harmed negatively the students who, in
consequence, faced many linguistic deficiencies and great difficulties in writing. In addition, they
encountered an inability to distinguish between the classroom and the social media context. This
situation pushed them to use informal expressions and abbreviations in their writing task which
turned to be a habit that was observed in students’ pieces of writing. Moreover, it was noticed that
students’ writing was influenced by their native language as they relied on expressions that were
part of their daily life speech in the writing tasks. The results also demonstrated a positive aspect
of social media that cannot be denied. The study appears to support the argument for a change in
the way writing is taught. Thus, the most appropriate solutions would be the introduction of ICT’s
for teaching writing, and the reliance on social media for educational purposes. This method of
teaching would likely meet students’ needs and interest in nowadays globalized world.
The study addressed only some areas of the writing skill with focus on certain linguistic
aspects like the grammatical structure, punctuation, cohesion and coherence and spelling mistakes.
Further investigations on the topic should be held by future researchers to provide wider
perspectives on the subject area. Moreover, due to the significant influence of speaking on the
students’ written production that was witnessed in the writing tasks, the researcher opens the door
for future research in which the area of interest shifts to the speaking skills in order to assess the
effect of social media on the students’ speech. The solutions should not be restricted to Tlemcen
University only, but could be generalized to the rest of the Algerian universities in order to improve
the existing situation, and harmonize working methods. The present work dealt only with one
aspect of e-assessment which was social media; however, other digital tools such as platforms will
be used in the near future to evaluate their impact on EFL students’ written production.
