"9" "INTRODUCTION"
"10" "Despite  being a much investigated hypothesis, evidence for the effect of  negative news coverage on  attitudes toward the pol ice is not entirely conclusive   (Chermak et al., 2006; Graziano, 2018) .  Th e   somewhat  scarce  evidence might be attributed to the predominant lack of causal inference in previous approaches  (Graziano, 2018) . Graziano concludes in her systematic meta-review of related research that: “(…) “media matters” where percep tions of police are concerned”  (2018) , while other researchers go so far as to emphasize that “... newsmedia  (…) subject police to critical scrutiny th at erodes police legitimacy.” (Lawrence, 2000) ."
"11" "Concerning police legitimacy, most approaches find  that personal experiences with police  officers   (Gau, 2010) ,  ethnicity  of the respondents   (Novich & Hunt, 2018; Tuch & Weitzer, 1997; Weitzer, 1999, 2002; Weitzer & Tuch, 2004) , prior victimization, socioeconomic   status, context of residence, political attitudes as well as punitive values  (Roché & Roux, 2017)   constitute   relevant   predictor s .   While  p rocedural  j ustice upholds the image of the “S ilver Bullet to good policing”  (Roché & Roux, 2017) , newer studies demonstrate that  deterioration in attitudes toward  the police might as well be attributed to a more complex phenomenon . This more recent research  takes media coverage  of police actions in to account   (Gauthier & Graziano, 2018; Graziano et al., 2009; Graziano, 2018; Hohl et al., 2012) ."
"12" "This study   employs  random variation in the field period  of the European Social Survey  (ESS Round 8, 2016) ,   and a case of major police misconduct in France, thus providing a  n atural  e xperiment to investigate how trust in the police  is  affected by external shocks such as media coverage of police malpractice. The broad thematic scope and methodological composition of the ESS allows  for testing  a  set of different hypotheses ,  such as moderating effects of  migrant background s ,   and frequency of   use of different media."
"13" "While   this   research design  has  already  been applied by many scholars  in   order  to study attitudinal changes over short periods of time , most of these papers focus on the effect s  of major events like terrorist attacks on attitudes towards minority groups  ( e.g.  Castanho Silva, 2018; Legewie, 2013) .   So far, only  a few studies have transferred this design to other contexts.  One exception is the paper by Ares and Hernandez  (2017)   on the impact of a corruption scandal on trust in politicians.  To the best of   our  knowledge, this study is the first application of this particular design ,  that Muñoz et al  (2019)  call the “Unexpected Event during Survey Design” (UESD),   in the field of police research.  Most s tudies that had previously dealt with the effects of media reporting on police misconduct  were restricted by samples from  the  individual cities   or nearest areas  where the misconduct took place   (Hohl et al., 2012; Kaminski & Jefferis, 1998; Kochel, 2019; Lasley, 1994; White et al., 2018) .   Although this approach probably makes it easier to find an effect when it is there, it poses problems in terms of the external validity of research results.   Additionally , in most of these previous studies, the assignment to either control or experimental group could not be considered  to be  effectively random   ( see for example  Kääriäinen et al., 2016) , underlining the  continuing  need for causal pathways in this research avenue  (Graziano, 2018) .  Our identification strategy relies on two comparable but separate analysis designs. We combine findings from a regression   discontinuity design   ( RDD )  with an OLS natural experiment that can be considered an UESD study."
"14" "Finally, our study contributes to the existing literature by examining a new national context that is particularly interesting because France has a generally low level of trust in the police compared to other European countries   (Schaap & Scheepers, 2014) ."
"15" "THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK & HYPOTHESES"
"16" "R esearch of media effects on the public image of the police is limited by a lack of theoretical orientation and articulation of a causal link between event, media processing and the actual change in  public  attitudes  (Gauthier & Graziano, 2018; Graziano, 2018) .  By combining elaborations from various theoretical approaches,  this study provides  a rationale that explains the overall linkage as well as possible intensifications of the effect .   Worden and Mclean  (2017)   distinguish between two broad theoretical strea ms concerning police legitimacy. The  first  one, procedural justice theory,   is rooted in   social psychology .   It   defines procedural justice as the key determinant of police legitimacy   and can clearly be considered  as the most common approach in explaining attitudes toward the police   (Murphy & Tyler, 2017; Tyler & Wakslak, 2004) .  The second stems from organizational institutionalism,  or sociological neo-institutionalists approaches,  and is concerned with external demands that are placed on organizations and how those organizations respond  (Worden & McLean, 2017) ."
"17" "Tyler  (1988) , as a major contributor to the first  of  these two  strands of literatures, argues that citizen’s judgment about whether legal authorities act fairly is, among other issues, heavily dependent on the degree to which authorities follow ethical principles of conduct.  While much research within  procedural justice theory  considers personal experience with police as a crucial   predictor of the public image of the police  (Gau, 2010) ,  there is evidence  that perceived unjust treatment of others  might cause comparable effects  (Chermak et al., 2006; Gau, 2014; Graziano & Gauthier, 2018; Maguire et al., 2017; Rosenbaum et al., 2005) .   Although some  earlier  studies reveal that trust in the police is negatively affected by devast at ing police scandals or  grave cases of police  mis conduct , empirical   evidence  on  the corrosive effect of high-profile police  scandals  on trust in the police  still  remains  vague, as  previous studies were  – with very rare exceptions  (Sigelman et al., 1997) – limited to surveys from individual cities  or  to  non-experimental designs."
"18" "Within the   sociological neo- institutionalist  framework,  Deephouse  and  Suchman   argue  in  favor  of understanding media as “legitimacy mediators”: “(…) who make or convey implicit or explicit legitimacy assessments as a side-effect of their routine operations” (Deephouse & Suchman, 2008) .  This statement and the resulting implications for  this study   are comparable with the basic assumptions made by Gerbner  (1970) .  In a radically condensed form, George  Gerbner  postulates in his “cultivation theory”, which is  arguably  more of a paradigm than a coherent social science theory   (Morgan & Shanahan, 2010) , that greater rates of television viewing will increase the likelihood of consumers assuming worldviews as portrayed on television. As news today are not  exceptionally  received via television, but increasingly online ,  these assumptions need to be adjusted in order to correspond to today's media landscape.  It is therefore plausible to assume that internet users will  adopt   worldviews supplied on internet media  as well .  Picking up on these developments,  recent empirical studies examine the influence of  i nternet media on police perception  (Intravia et al., 2017; Roche et al., 2016) ."
"19" "Methodological individualism can assist in  combining   these different theoretical  approaches .  Coleman’s  (1986)   micro-macro-model can help to describe  the underlying social mechanism   (also see   Hedstrom & Swedberg, 1998 ) .  A local incident of police misconduct, initially at the micro level of social action, becomes public and is thus found at t he macro level of social action .  The way in which the incident is made public is not always transparent. Examples of this procedure can be videos of the incident that end up on the Internet or court cases.   The incident , however,  is now processed by the media and is therefore being witnessed by others who then , individually,  alter their opinions towards the police  in a negative way  (micro level) . Through a  process of  aggregation or imitation, this individual change of attitude towards the  police is now also found in the  corresponding  population as a whole , and hence results in a loss  of trust in the police, again,  at the macro level of social action.  This  simple  social mechanism leads  to the first hypothesis of this study"
"20" "H1: The resp ec tive case of police misconduct will reduce trust in the police."
"21" "The trigger for the devastating uprisings in France is considered the severe abuse of a black man  in early February 2017 in Paris .  As Gra ziano and G a uthier point out  (2018) , ethnicity is an important predictor of  attitudes toward the police  in all previous studies. The results of the study by  Chermak   et al . (2006) , however, indicate that blacks only show significantly lower general attitudes towards the police compared to whites after the intense publicity of serious cases of police misconduct.  This yields the second hypothesis:"
"22" "H2: The negative effect of the respective case of police misconduct will be stronger among people  who   report  having  a migrant background"
"23" "Our   next  two hypotheses focus on the effect of the frequency of the use of different media.  Corresponding to the above mentioned assumptions ,  and in line with elaborations from  sociological neo- institutionalism  (Deephouse & Suchman, 2008) , cultivation theory  (Gerbner, 1970) ,  and newer empirical  hypotheses   (Intravia et al., 2017; Roche et al., 2016) ,   we   expect use  of traditional media like radio or television  to be associated with the focal incident.  In particular, we expect that higher frequencies of media consumption correspond with   clearer   decreases  of   trust in the police   through  the event."
"24" "H3: The negative effect of the respective case of police misconduct will be stronger among people  who   express a high frequency of watching, reading or listening news about politics and current affairs."
"25" "Other scholars already indicate that consumption of internet use is related to negative attitudes about p o lice and exposure to negative news about police might  affect   perceptions  (Graziano & Gauthier, 2018; Intravia et al., 2017) . More negative attitudes, shown by those  respondents  who rely most on the Internet for their news, may be due to unfiltered access to more unfavorable news, videos and public commentary about the police than traditional media allow. This  idea  is consistent with the central premise of cultivation theory that individuals adopt the worldviews to which they are most exposed to by the media  (Gauthier & Graziano, 2018) .  Research shows that fake news spread faster through social media  (Vosoughi et al., 2018) . Hate speech moves faster through online communities when the content remains uncensored  (Álvarez-Benjumea & Winter, 2018) .  Thus ,  we arrive at our final hypothes i s:"
"26" "H4:  The negative effect of the respective case of police misconduct will be stronger among people  who   express a high frequency of internet use."
"27" "THE EMPIRICAL SETTING.  THE  2017 FRENCH RIOTS"
"28" "The 2017 French riots refer to two separate  uproars  following abuse of power by police. The first incident of unrest began on 4 February 2017, following the alleged rape of a  22-year old black man ,  named Theo L. ,  with a  baton  by police . The second sets of riots began when a Chinese man was shot dead by police officers in Paris in late March. However, due to the timing of the field period of the ESS,  only  the first incident  can be used  as an exogenous shock to study its effect on trust in the police."
"29" "On 2 February 2017, four police officers approached a group of young people in a Paris suburb. Although the account of the events by Theo L. differs from those of the police officers, and it is therefore not clear who started the altercation, it has been confirmed via video surveillance that one of the police officers detained Theo while another police officer showered the group with tear gas. Due to the subsequent alleged rape with a baton, the victim  had to  be rushed to the hospital for an emergency operation. He spen t  several weeks at the hospital  where he was visited by former French president François Hollande. After investigation of the incident, the four officers were placed under judicial review. Three were banned from official police activity. Minister of the Interior  Bruno Le Roux  also suspended the four policemen immediately as a precautionary measure."
"30" "Following the first media reports of the alleged rape of  a  black man, a series of severe protests against police violence began that continued  until  15 February.  To  provide  a better picture of how the scandal rose in salience, Figure 1 shows the frequencies of google searches about the scanda l."
"31" "< Insert Figure 1 here >"
"32" "As the graph shows, the maximum peak was reached around mid-February. In the course of March, however, Goog le searches declined rapidly .  For further details on the 2017 French riots,  see   Mulholand   (2017) ."
"33" "DATA AND METHODS "
"34" "Data"
"35" "The ESS is a cross-national survey that every two years reviews attitudes, beliefs, and behavior patterns in European countries on the basis of probability samples gathered through face-to-face interviews. A detailed fieldwork and data documentation can be found at <www.europeansocialsurvey.org>.  We use the ESS subsample for France. The fieldwork for the French subsample took place from Nov. 10 2016 to March 11, 2017.  Since the fieldwork period  coincided  with the scandal described above  (Feb. 02, 2017) ,  and since the ESS  8  includes an item asking for  respondents’  trust in  the  police,   it provides an ideal setting for a natural experiment.  The  F rench  ESS sample contains 2070 valid cases. We drop  all  cases that  were interviewed on the exact date of the event because we cannot be sure whether these respondents belong to the control (before the event) or treatment group (after the event). This red uces the main sample to  n  =  206 0   cases.  We applied the design weight  provided by the ESS  in all analyses.  Sample sizes therefore differ  minimally  on occasions , even if there are no missing values."
"36" "Dependent variable"
"37" "The dependent variable  “ trust in the  police“  is  measured on a n  eleven-point Likert-type item ,  ranging from 0  “ No trust at all“ to 10  “ Complete trust“.   There is still no  real  consensus in the academic debate whether legitimacy of or trust in the police are  rather  synonymous or distinct   (Jackson & Gau, 2016; Kaina, 2008; Kearns et al., 2019; Tyler, 2004) .  Even if   trust in the police is understood as a facet of police legitimacy  (Hough et al., 2010; Kearns et al., 2019; Tyler & Jackson, 2014)  or   at least  a  cognate  concept   (Tankebe, 2013) , the single item used in this study provides only a small  fragment of  the multidimensional structure that is police legitimacy   (Bradford & Jackson, 2010; Hough et al., 2010) .   On the other hand , it is reported that the global item is highly correlated with more specific attitudes  (Cao et al., 2012; Frank et al., 1996; Garcia & Cao, 2005) .  And in our quasi-experimental design, a single, intuitively answerable item might be even better suited to measure possible effects than more specific items that may have too little relation to the incident. Nevertheless, we use  only  the single-item in our study since we are restricted to the composition of the ESS."
"38" "Treatment and predictor variables"
"39" "To analyze the effect of the event , p r oposed by hypotheses  1 ,   our treatment variable is a  dummy variable  Τ i   that is operationalized as follows:"
"40" "0  if Person  i  was interviewed before the incident (n = 185 3 ) 0  if Person  i  was interviewed before the incident (n = 185 3 )"
"41" "0  if Person  i  was interviewed before the incident (n = 185 3 )"
"42" "0  if Person  i  was interviewed before the incident (n = 185 3 )"
"43" "1 if Person  i  was interviewed after the incident (n = 207 ) 1 if Person  i  was interviewed after the incident (n = 207 )   Τ i ="
"44" "1 if Person  i  was interviewed after the incident (n = 207 )"
"45" "1 if Person  i  was interviewed after the incident (n = 207 )"
"46" "To test hypotheses  2 - 4 (interaction effects),  we  create  three product terms with the treatment  variable . To arrive at a good measurement for migratory background,  we constructed  a new variable  called  „ migrant“ ,  which  obtained   the value 0 if  the respondent’s  father and mother were born in France ,   and  the value 1 if father or mother were not born in France."
"47" "To test the other two  interaction effects ,   w e  use d  two items asking either for the  amount  of minutes watching, reading or listening to news about politics and current affairs on a regular day (hypothes i s  3 ) ,  and the amount of internet use on a typical day in minutes (hypothes i s  4 ). To  facilitate  interpretation, these two variables  were   dichotomized  on  their  respective mean. Persons below the mean  were   assigned the value zero. Persons above the mean  were   assigned the value one."
"48" "Control variables"
"49" "The strictly exogenous   control  variables consist of  age  of the respondents,  female   as a  dummy variable (1 = female; 0 = male) ,  income  and  education .   Education   was   measured on a 25-point scale, where the highest value represents doctoral  degree .  Due to many missing values in the income variable,   we   assign ed  the mean to  all  missing cases. Furthermore,   w e  log ged  the  variable to adjust for the well-known skewed distribution in  income .   To give an overview ,  Table 1  shows summary  statistics  by   control and treatment group  for all variables ."
"50" "< Insert Table 1 here >"
"51" "As  Legewie  indicates  (2013) , there are two potential threats to an unbiased estimator of the causal effect using a comparable quasi-experimental research design.  The   ignorability  assumption   is fulfilled if  the chance  of  be ing  assigned to the control or treatment group can be a ssumed to be effectively random.  Second,   our  identification  strategy relies on the  temporal stability assumption . Put   simply , this assumption implies that without the treatment, there would be no effect on the outcome."
"52" "To check for the  ignorability  assumption, an imbalance test was conducted.   An  imbalance test is  a logistical regression with the treatment variable as outcome, while all other variables  that are  used in the analyses  were considered  as  predictors.  Results can be seen in  T able 2.  Confirming   our  assumption, and highlighting the data quality of the ESS, none of the variables indicate a significant effect on the treatment, implying that there apparently exists no relevant imbalance between control and treatment group  on these variables .  To test for the  temporal stability  assumption , a number of different ly  designed placebo regression s  were calculated .   T he  results  a re discussed  below ( afte r  the  discussion of the  main results ) ."
"53" "< Insert  T able  2 here >"
"54" "RESULTS "
"55" "First test: Regression Discontinuity"
"56" "To investigate the impact on trust in the police right after the incident, a regression discontinuity design is used  (Angrist & Pischke, 2008) . In our approach, we are guided to a large extent by the practical guide provided by  Skovron and  Tit iu nik   (2015)   as well as recent applications that work with very similar data and designs   (Castanho Silva, 2018; van Hauwaert & Huber, 2020) ."
"57" "The basic idea behind RDD is that a treatment can be assigned for observations based on whether the value of a score exceeds a known cut-off  (Skovron & Titiunik, 2015) .  Units whose scores are barely below the cut-off are therefore comparable to units whose scores are barely above it so that any difference in the outcome is attributable to the given treatment conditional on certain assumptions that we will discuss at the end of this section."
"58" "The most important aspect in RDD applications is arguably the definition of the bandwidth. In our case, bandwidth is days before and after the incident. We create a discrete  variable z (also called the running variable), which equals days before and after the event, where 0 indicates the exact day of the event. We then use the  Imbens  and  Kalyanaraman  method for obtaining optimal bandwidth which is a completely data-driven approach that minimizes an approximation to the asymptotic mean square error (MSE) of our local average treatment effect (LATE)   (Imbens & Kalyanaraman, 2012) . Figure 2 gives an illustration of the development of our outcome right before and after the incident."
"59" "< Insert Figure 2 here >"
"60" "Following   Skovorn  and  Titiunik   (2015)   as well as  Van  Hauwaert  and Huber  (2020) , we rely on two local linear estimators of the outcome (one before and one after the incident) instead of higher order polynomials  which is recommended when the  running variable is discrete.   The difference of intercepts between these two models can be considered the RD effect. Slope differences on the other hand can inform us about the development of the treatment effect in the days following the event. Table  3  gives an overview of the RD effect s  for the optimal bandwidth as well as a double and half bandwidth  for estimates with   heteroskedasticity robust standard errors  (HC3 method is used) . The analyses imply a substantial worsening of trust in the police for the optimal and double bandwidth. For example, people interviewed six days after the event show an average of 1.797 less points on trust in the police compared to people interviewed six days before the event. The effect is significant with p = .0 41 . 13 days after the event, the treatment effect’s size decreases to -1.436 while still being significant with p =.0 2 0 . However, for the half bandwidth the effect is not significant. Non-significance might be attributable to a lack of statistical power due to low sample sizes ( n total   = 63). Although not being significant for this bandwidth, the RDD effect is still pronounced indicating a loss of trust in the police after the incident of 1.591 points."
"61" "Accordingly, these results cannot fully reject the assumptions made in hypothesis 1. All three post-treatment models show a positive slope coefficient for  z i . This, and the obvious decrease in the treatment effect’s size for the double optimal bandwidth, implies that trust might be regained quickly after the incident   (See Appendix  1, figure A1 to A3  for a graphical illustration of all bandwidth choices and their respective  conditional expectation functions )."
"62" "Validation of RDD"
"63" "As mentioned above, we will now turn to validate our RD  d esign. We therefore re-estimate all models but this time controlling for the covariates presented in table 1. Before running the models, we check for each bandwidth whether the samples are balanced with regard to the given covariates. Samples are balanced for each but the optimal bandwidth   where there are more people with a higher level of education in the treatment group  (See Appendix 2, table A1 to A3) .  Including education as a control should remedy this imbalance, however   (Muñoz et al., 2019) .  Results are robust to the inclusion of these covariates. (See Appendix  2, table A4 ). We then test effects on placebo outcomes (all other institutional trust variables contained in the ESS) and all continuous pre-determined covariates (age, income and education).  We find no effect  that is significantly different from zero for p < .05  on any other outcomes except for trust in the police  (See Appendix 2, table A5 to A13) .  We also test whether there is a treatment effect at an alternative cut-off  (Skovron & Titiunik, 2015) .  Following   Imbens  and Lemieux   ( 2008 ) ,    we split the control  and treatment group  at  their  empirical  median and test for an effect (or to be specific: its absence) at this point. As expected, we cannot find any effect at th ese  alternative cut-off point s  that is significantly different from zero   for p <. 05   (See Appendix 2, table A14 to A15) .  Finally, we also check the density of the running variable using a McCrary sorting test   (McCrary, 2008)  (See Appendix 2, table A16) .  Given these results,  our  estimates  are robust to these sensitivity analyses."
"64" "Second test: OLS Natural Experiment"
"65" "Even though   RDD allows for testing the immediate effect of being exposed to the treatment in  a  way very much  comparable to a  R andomized  C ontrol  T rial  (RCT) , it  lacks a test for interaction effects  (Castanho Silva, 2018) .  To  arrive at a better understanding of the event ’s effect  on trust in the police  and to test hypotheses 2-4 , a number of  OLS  regressions for the whole sample in the  fashion  specified above in the data and methods section  were  run."
"66" "Before doing so,   w e  have  checked  all prerequisites for a n   OLS  estimation in a model containing all control variables and interaction effects. To avoid multicollinearity, the variables forming product terms with the treatment effect were centered at the mean   (Cronbach, 1987) . The Breusch-Pagan test indicates a pronounced unequal distribution of residual variances, making OLS estimates no longer efficient. Following the advice by Angrist and  Pischke   (2008) ,   w e  compute both OLS models  with  homoscedasticity -robust standard errors  as well as models with  heteroscedasticity- robust standard errors  (simply referred to as robust standard errors) . Since  coefficient  size, standard errors and t- values differ only slightly,   w e  only report the results of the  robust standard error  models . In addition, the estimates in robust standard error models tend to provide  results that are more conservative .   The  R 2  values  of all models  are generally very low, which implies that the data contain a high amount of unexplainable variability .  For this reason, it should be noted that the precision of the estimates is limited."
"67" "< Insert  T able  3 here >"
"68" "Table 3 gives an overview of the results.  We  begin  with a base line  model , containing only the  t reatment effe ct as a predictor, t hen a model   with exog e nous control s  and finally a model with full set of controls as well as interaction terms. Since  the treatment variable was centered on the mean, the  coefficient   can be interpreted  as  the main effect. The results support  the  assumption from hypothes i s  1  as well as  the results  from  the  RDD  analysis . Comparing people in the whole dataset, those  respondents  interviewed after the event have a n  average of .4 6 1 scale points less trust in the police  th a n  those  respondents  interviewed  before the event  (Model I in Table 3) . The effect is  significant  with  p  = .00 2 , 95 %  CI  [-.754, -.169] . A dding  control variables to the model does not change the main effect   much . Adding strictly  exogenous  controls  (Model II in Table 3) ,  alters  the main effect slightly to -.4 16 , by staying significant with p = .00 5 ,  CI [-.708, -.124] .   Adding interaction effects does not mediate the  main effect as well, though it is only significant for p =. 015 in model V, which might be attributed to the large amount of missing values in the internet control variable.  Overall , these results  support hypothes i s   1 .  However, the coefficient s   are   considerably  lower than the main effect in the RDD  analysis.   This   result  is a  possible  indication that trust in the police was severely shaken by the  incident , but  apparently might have been  quickly regained  to a certain degree .  This  notion  can also be seen from the higher slope coefficient of the post-treatment model compared to the pre-treatment model in the RDD  (See Appendix  1 )."
"69" "The interaction effect between  a migrant background  and the dichotomous treatment variable s hows a strong effect of  B  =  - . 671 , with   significance of  p =.0 4 1 , CI [- 1 . 314 , -.0 29 ] .This  finding   impl ies   that persons  with a migrant background  interviewed after the event show an average of  . 671  scale points less trust in the police than  persons with a migrant background   from  the control group."
"70" "To provide a better graphical picture  of the interaction effects ,   w e  performed a multifactorial  Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) .  As can be seen quite clearly  in Figure 3 , people in the control group always report more trust in the police than people in the tr e atment group. However, if they  also  have  a migrant background, the effect is way more pronounced  (upper  panel) .  People in the control group who have a migrant background report even more trust in the police than people  who have no migrant background  ( lower  panel).   In ANOVA terms, this is what is called a  “ hybrid  interaction “ .  Overall ,  the  results   yield  e vidence for  the  second  hypothes i s ."
"71" "< Insert Figure 3 here >"
"72" "However, Figure 3 also shows large standard errors, which is why we conducted a new test for hypothesis 2, where we constructed the interaction term from another variable contained in the ESS, asking respondents whether or not they belong to an ethnic minority.  We coded  the product term in the exact way specified above. Results are  even more striking , implying a n  interaction effect of  B = -1.836 with p = .040  CI [-3.584, -.087] . Still, t he substantial coefficient  size  is at the expense of  an  equally extreme standard error   (See Appendix 3 for the corresponding model with robust standard errors). Nonetheless, t his additional analysis  give s  us further confidence in the  “ confirmation ”  of hypothesis 2."
"73" "Even if the polarity of the two other interaction effects  (hypotheses 3 and 4)  point in the right direction, the  coefficients  are not significant.  Frequency of media use as well as frequency of internet use is apparently not associated with trust in the police after the alleged rape.  However, model VI shows a very high amount of missing values, decreasing statistical power  to test  the final hypotheses.  Concerning  the   assumptions implied by hypotheses  2  –  4 , it  seems  that only hypothes i s  2   is  supported  by the data ."
"74" "Robustness checks OLS natural experiment"
"75" "Ignorability  assumption"
"76" "Since the scandal broke late in the fieldwork period, it might be the case that some regions in  F rance were only reached  (surveyed)  before the scandal. This would lead to  a   potential reachability bias.  It can be  verified  easily empirically by cross-tabulating the treatment variable with the region variable for France. There is no single region that has not been reached in either control or treatment group ( s ee Appendi x   4, table A18 ) .  However, some regions only obtained very few observations in the treatment group (e. g. Centre-Val der Loire, Franche-Comté, etc.).   We therefore re- estimate a model where  we  removed all regions that ha d  less than five observations in the treatment group.   Results are largely robust to the deletion of these cases. However, the interaction effect between migrant background and the  treatment variable now only is significant with p  =. 055.   The other interaction effects  still  do not meet an acceptable significance level.  Results can be seen in Appendix  4, table A19 ."
"77" "Tempor al stability assumption"
"78" "To  check   for the afore mentioned temporal stability assumption ,   w e  tested  all  other  institutional  trust variables  contained in the ESS 8.Though we  could not find any sign i ficant placebo result for a variable that was not associated in any way to the scandal , we found a strong negative impact on trust in the parliament  (B = -.539; p = .001 , CI 95% [-.872; -.207] ), as well as a somewhat weaker effect on trust in politicians (B = -.288; p =  . 059 , CI 95% [-0588, .011] ) , see Appendix  5 ,  t able A 20 to A26 .   We could not replicate these effects  in   RDD analysis, however  ( See Appendix 2, table A5 and A7 ) .  The fact that these effects could not be identified by an RDD suggests that  they  were delayed to the main effect  which is the effect on trust in the police.  As   Muñoz et al. argue  (2019) , th ese  placebo  effect s  could be an indication that another event has taken place, that  may explain  the loss of trust in the French Parliament   and its politicians  as well as the effect on our actual outcome , but we could not identify any  such event . On the other hand, these effects could be understood as a spillover effect, as they occurred with a time delay to the loss of trust in the police. However, since we have not made any theoretical considerations about such a transfer effect on other state institutions, such considerations remain speculative."
"79" "We  also   replicated the analyses with the ESS 7 since the  fieldwork  period was very similar ,  and we could  “ pretend “   that  the scandal happened two year s  in advance.  As expected, n o  placebo results  show up (see Appendix  5, table A27 ) . Finally ,  following Pollock et al.  (2015) , Ares and Hernandez  (2017)  as well as Muñoz et al  (2019) , we use the  German  subsample of the ESS   as a counterfactual since the fieldwork period coincided with the fieldwork in France. Again,   w e  do not find any significant results   (s ee Appendix  5, table A28 ) ."
"80" "Finally,  we want to refer to an important but often neglected issue in UESD studies that   Muñoz et al   (2019)  point out . They argue that, despite the similarities of UESD and RCT, treatment effect should only be interpreted as an  Intent-T o - Treat (ITT) effect  rather than an Average-Treatment-Effect (ATE)  since  in a UESD environment  it is more likely that  respondents   in the treatment group  would not have  been exposed to the treatment.  Given  the lack of appropriate manipulation checks , this is a common problem in natural experiments with survey data. Still, even though we identified substantial and significant effects in RDD and the OLS natural experiment, we want to stress that we cannot be entirely sure that all respondents have effectively been exposed to the treatment."
"81" "DISCUSSION & CONCLU S IONS"
"82" "The aim of the stud y was to investigate the effect  of the alleged rape of a young black man by police officers, which in turn provoked the 2017  F rench riots, on trust in the police. In addition,  we examined  whether  respondents'  ethnicity as well as the frequency of consumption of different media could exacerbate the effect."
"83" "In line with procedural justice theory as well as institutionalis t approaches ,  the  d ata analysis indicates that trust in the police has suffered considerably as a result of the incident described. This  finding  is not only the  outcome   of different re gression  models considering the whole fieldwork period of the ESS in France but also the differences in intercepts concerning the RDD.  The  results are robust to  various  placebo tests, enhancing the reliability of   our  estimates."
"84" "Furthermore,   w e  find evidence fo r the moderating influence of a  migration background.  A fter the incident , p ersons whose father or mother were not born in France  show ed   significantly less  trust  in the police than comparable  individuals did   in the control group. From these  results,   w e  conclude  that  the  first two hypotheses  can be  “ confirmed ” ."
"85" "Although the two interaction effects used to test the moderating influence of the frequency of use of different media had no significant impact , the coefficients point  in the predicted direction.  We  cannot  “ confirm ”  the se  hypotheses, but would like to remind that these assumptions should be reassessed in follow-up studies to avoid a  possible  t ype II error.   In addition,  we have no possibility to differentiate in our analyses between different media outlets.  Given that the framing of information on misconduct may vary by the political orientation of the  print  media outlet or website,  it is conceivable that  not all exposure  has  similar effects.  Obviously ,  exposure via , for example,  “ Le Monde ”   might be   rather  different from exposure in  “ Libération ”. Concerning the internet moderator, we are limited in our research design since  the ESS  8  does not contain an item that asks directly about the  frequency of  consumption of Internet  news  media. By including such an item  as an interaction term , it might be easier to find an effect when it is there."
"86" "The results of the analysis  fit   the  link  described above, which depicts a causal  connection  between incident on the micro level and  the  macro phenomenon.   Th is link  has so far been identified mainly in the cities  where the incident took place.  Therefore, this study increases the external validity of the previous studies cited above.   By  employing a quasi-experimental design ,  the  study  can be assumed to increase the internal validity of  this assumption  as well .   Furthermore,  Chermak  et al.’s (2006)   as well as  Kochel’s    (2019)  f inding s   are  supported  that people in the  respective  peer group  that suffered most in the event  are more severely affected by the effect  of police misconduct on  trust  and/or legitimacy .  So far, this  “ peer group effect ”  has  mainly  been observed among ethnic groups   (Ellis et al., 2018) . Depending on the type of incident, other interaction effects are also conceivable, such as social class  or political ideology  (Intravia et al., 2020) .  Since the impact is extremely sudden  ( s ee results of RDD  analysis ) , the question remains as to which media was used most to spread the news about the  incident. A distinction between traditional and Internet media could not answer this question in  the   present   study.   The precise explanation of the  mechanism  bet ween event and attitude  change   remains  unclear .  Hence, more research is necessary, which should focus especially on the diffusion of such messages in social networks  and social media in general , as previous exploratory research has suggested  that  social media  might be  more likely to spread information regarding malpractice in policing ethnic minorities  than traditional media   (Hockin & Brunson, 2018) .  Additionally, there is some recent evidence  suggesting  that internet and social media exposure  of adverse news stories involving the police  might be detrimental to police legitimacy  (Intravia et al., 2020) ."
"87" "There are two essential reasons that lead  us  to believe that the effect identified here is short-lived. Firstly, the positive slope coefficient of the post - treatment model in the RDD  analysis  indicates an improvement of the  decrease in trust   ( see Appendix  1 ) .   S econdly, the regression models that examine the entire sample have much smaller   effect s  than the intercept differences in the RDD .  This  result  is well in line with the literature on media effects as well as empirical findings in other contexts   (Ares & Hernández, 2017; Gerber et al., 2011) .  Political  opinions might be based on top-of-the-head decisions  (Zaller, 1992) ,  and it seems  likely that  this phenomenon  can also be transferred to   trust in the police .   These considerations are in line with  prior  work on police legitimacy and also provide some evidence that Reiner's statement  about the police being a  \" t eflon  service\", where even major scandals have only short-lived negative effects,  might  be valid in France as well   (Reiner, 2010) .  Newer studies should therefore pay particular attention  to  the way in which police institutions themselves respond to such crisis events. Some rhetorical strategies may be more useful than others in restoring damaged legitimacy  relatively soon after the events   (Elsbach, 1994; O’Brien et al., 2020) .  This  idea  also points to the need for qualitative  studies  of police reactions crisis events   (also see Fallik et al., 2020) ."
"88" "Accordingly , this study contributes to the existing literature by providing France as a new  national context .   Results suggest  that trust in the police is not  particularly stable in France.  This finding is consistent with many studies in  areas  with a generally low level  to  of trust in the police. In contrast, countries with a high level of trust in the police appear to be less susceptible to  critique by the media   (Kääriäinen et al., 2016; Thomassen et al., 2014) ."
"89" "While our general finding of a decrease in trust in the police for people in the post-incident sample is consistent with a large body of prior research  (Jefferis et al., 1997; Kaminski & Jefferis, 1998; Kochel, 2019; Lasley, 1994; Tuch & Weitzer, 1997; Weitzer, 2002) , our results  somewhat  contradict findings from  White et al   (2018) . White and colleagues analyzed the effect of the police inflicted murder of a young black man called Freddie Gray in April 2015 in Baltimore by taking advantage of a large residential survey. Although they found little to no change in attitudes toward the police, they argue that a possible effect might have been masked by   very low levels of police legitimacy and trustworthiness beforehand.  Thus, the mistreatment and subsequent killing of Freddie Gray may not have been an exogenous shock, as residents were already accustomed to severe cases of police violence . Taking together the se  considerations  and results from previous research as well as our own findings , it seems  like perceptions of the police are  affected  by high profile cases of police misconduct, only if the prior public image of the police was neither too bad nor too good.  Thus, our study could provide another important piece of a broader puzzle of how negative police publicity affects relations between civilians and the police. Still , more research is needed to make international comparisons more accurate."
"90" "T his study  h as limitations.  Given the “noisy” data,  our estimates are relatively i m precise.  Furthermore , the available data do  not permit a more precise description of the effect’s decay , because  the  fieldwork  period of the ESS in France ended on March 11, 2017  (37 days after the event) . Since the number of observations towards the end of the fieldwork period  decreases , the decline of the effect may well be due to the   shrinking   sample size  and a resulting ever-increasing fluctuation in all  items .   Therefore ,   the  assumption about  effect’s decay   is still  somewhat  speculative and should be tested in  future   studies."
"91" "Although   w e  use a considerable array of analyses to check  RDD assumptions as well as  both  the  ignorability   and  temporal stability assumption   empirically , there is no way to avoid all remaining bias,  because   these  results could still be driven b y   unobserved  variables.   Additionally,  Muñoz et al.   (2019)  urge us to a restricted interpretation of the causal effect due to the one-sided noncompliance problem discussed above.   For th ese  reason s , it is important to exploit any possibility for comparable natural experiments  and to conduct  genuinely randomized control trials,   systematic reviews and  meta-analyses   to  further  enhance  our understanding of how police scandals erode trust in the police.   Finally. t he biggest limitation of this study   might be  the outcome variable. As elaborated above, the single item of this study can only measure a fraction of the concept of trust in the police or  even police legitimacy  and there is recent advice against  relying exclusively on  one-dimensional instruments to capture trust in the police   (Morrell et al., 2019) .  However , as argued above, it may even be favorable for our  particular  study design .  Follow-up studies should focus, where possible, on more complex and diverse concepts  and compare those with single item measurements   (see Pass et al., 2020) ."

"641" "This imbalance is controlled for by including education as a covariate in table A4. Table A4 then gives the RDD results when all covariates presented in table 1 are included in the RD analyses. The results are on the whole comparable to those without covariate adjustment. There is still a pronounced effect for all bandwidth choices which is significant for p <. 05 for the optimal as well for the double optimal bandwidth. Though being substantial in size by implying a  -1.831  decrease in trust in the police, the effect for the half bandwidth again fails to reach any relevant threshold of significance due to its high standard error of 1.651 points. Again, we feel that this might be attributable to a lack of statistical power."

Some researchers call this the non-manipulation assumption  (Imbens & Lemieux, 2008) . In RDD with survey data where the cut-off point is a certain unpredictable date, we find it highly unlikely that respondents would be able to manipulate the reception of the treatment. However, our aim is to follow the RDD literature as accurately as possible and so we run a density test that is recommended by Skovron and  Titiuinik   (2015)  as well as by  Imbens  and Lemieux  (2008) ."
