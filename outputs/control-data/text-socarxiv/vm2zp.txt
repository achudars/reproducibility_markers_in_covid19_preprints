Abstract
Objectives The US show a distinct health disadvantage when compared to other
high-income nations. A potential lever to reduce this disadvantage is to improve
the health situation of lower socioeconomic groups. Our objective is to explore how
the considerable within-US variation in health inequalities compares to the health
inequalities across other Western countries.
Methods Representative survey data from 44 European countries and the US
federal states were obtained from the fourth wave of the European Values Study
(EVS, 2008) and the 2008 wave of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). Using binary logistic regression, we analyze different forms of educational
inequalities in self-rated health (SRH), adjusted for age and sex.

Results The extent of educational inequalities in SRH varies considerably over
European countries and US states; with US states in general showing greater inequality, however differences between US states and European countries are less
clear than commonly assumed.
Conclusion The US have considerable differences in educational inequalities in
SRH across geographic locations. To understand the reasons for the US health
disadvantage, comparative research has to take into account the vast variation in
health inequalities within the US.

Introduction and background
When compared to other industrialized, high-income countries, the US population
exhibits a distinct health disadvantage across important health outcomes, such as
infant mortality, heart disease, sexually transmitted diseases, injuries from violence
and motor vehicle crashes, and life expectancy (Avendano and Kawachi, 2014; Beckfield and Bambra, 2016; Crimmins et al., 2011; GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of
Death Collaborators, 2016). While differences in health care might be one cause
of this disadvantage, it is unlikely that they are the main driver (Avendano and
Kawachi, 2014): The US has the highest health care spending in the world (Dieleman et al., 2016). Furthermore, the wide range of health indicators where the US is
at a disadvantage underlines that medical care deficiencies cannot be the sole cause.
A potential lever suggested to eliminate the overall health disadvantage of the US
population is to improve the health situation of lower socioeconomic groups (Adler
et al., 2016; Avendano and Kawachi, 2014; Schroeder, 2016).
Various studies (e.g. Avendano et al., 2009; Banks et al., 2006, 2016; Martinson
and Reichman, 2016; McDonough et al., 2010; Semyonov et al., 2013; Van Hedel
et al., 2016; Woolf and Aron, 2013) have shown that the US as a whole indeed
exhibits greater health inequalities by socioeconomic status than European countries. In addition, population health and health inequalities in the US vary greatly
by geographical location (Chetty et al., 2016; Currie and Schwandt, 2016; Ezzati
et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2006) and this geographical variation is not explainable

2

by race of the population or health care access and utilization alone (Avendano and
Kawachi, 2014; Murray et al., 2006). We define health inequalities in this context as
educational inequalities in self-rated health (SRH). While there are other dimensions
to health inequalities such as sex and race, we believe that socioeconomic status is
a particularly salient dimension, and that education is a particularly good indicator for socioeconomic status, for reasons laid out below in the ‘Data and method’
section.
In this study, we explore how within-US variation in the education–SRH association compares to the variation between European countries. Some of the association
between education and SRH is due to biological factors such as genes and these biological factors are commonly assumed not to vary across spatial contexts. Thus,
variation in the size of the education–SRH association across different regional and
national contexts points to the importance of social factors in the emergence of
health inequalities and illustrates the potential malleability of health inequalities by
social factors such as policy interventions. With Europe and the US, we contrast two
particularly interesting cases: Compared to Europe with its diverse and distinct historical trajectories and its resulting institutional variety (Mackenbach et al., 2013),
the US has experienced a rather homogeneous development in terms of institutions;
however, the US still exhibits a well-known within-country heterogeneity in terms
of health.
We are investigating educational inequalities in SRH in 44 European countries
and the 50 federal states of the US. We examine four key indicators of population
health and health inequalities: Next to presenting the overall prevalence of poor
health, we show the prevalence of poor health among the lower educated, an oftoverlooked indicator of health inequalities. In line with other recent research on
health inequalities (Dudal and Bracke, 2016; Kulhánová et al., 2014; Vandenheede
et al., 2015), we also rely on both absolute and relative measures of educational
inequalities in SRH.
Our study makes contributions to two contemporary debates in public health—
the debate as to how health inequalities differ between the US and similarly rich
countries (e.g. Martinson and Reichman, 2016; Van Hedel et al., 2016) and the debate about within-US differences in health inequalities (e.g. Chetty et al., 2016).
By virtue of doing so, we extend the ‘methodological nationalism’ (Wimmer and
Glick Schiller, 2002) prevalent in the majority of current comparative research on
health inequalities. Researchers often rely on the nation-state as a seemingly ‘natu-

3

ral’ unit of analysis (Olafsdottir et al., 2013), but the focus on nation states as units
of analysis can mask important heterogeneities within countries. Breaking down the
US into its 50 federal states and comparing them to European countries is a first
step toward looking into the black box of the nation-state in cross-national research,
exploring the variance of health inequalities within and between countries.

Data and method
We combine the 2008 waves of the European Values Study (EVS) and the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The 2008 wave of the EVS (EVS, 2011)
provides health self-ratings for samples of individuals from all European countries
with 100,000 or more inhabitants. Sampling and questionnaire translation procedures followed high quality standards to ensure comparability between countries.
Our European sample includes health information from 44 European countries and
the region of Kosovo. The BRFSS (CDC, 2008) is a US-state representative survey
of the adult population living in households. The BRFSS comprises large samples
from the 50 federal states as well as the District of Columbia. We chose the 2008
wave of the BRFSS for our analyses due to the temporal proximity to the EVS and
removed the US territories Guam, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico from the analysis.
For our analyses, we restricted the age range from 25 to 75 years to ensure
that respondents’ educational attainment process is completed and to remove health
variation attributable to differential life expectancies across areas. We restricted the
BRFSS to non-Hispanic Whites to focus on variation not attributable to racial health
inequalities in the US. This is common practice in research comparing health inequalities between the US and European countries (Avendano et al., 2009; Banks et al.,
2006). The number of respondents in each European country is about N = 1, 100
and in each US state around N = 5, 400, which allows us to meaningfully compare
differences between the federal states and European countries. The comparatively
small sample sizes in the EVS do not allow us to break down European countries
into subnational units. Exact sample sizes per country and federal state as well as
name abbreviations are reported in Table 1.

Self-rated health (SRH) is assessed with a single-item measure with five response
options. Exact wording and response categories vary between the surveys. SRH has
been shown to be a robust predictor of mortality in the context of industrialized
countries (Jylhä, 2009). The BRFSS measures self-rated health with the question
‘Would you say that in general your health is . . . ’ and five response categories ‘Poor,’
‘Fair,’ ‘Good,’ ‘Very good,’ and ‘Excellent.’ The EVS asks ‘All in all, how would you

describe your state of health these days? Would you say it is . . . ,’ and the response
options provided are ‘Very poor,’ ‘Poor,’ ‘Fair,’ ‘Good,’ and ‘Very good.’ Similar to
Olafsdottir et al. (2013), we opted for a relative concordance interpretation (Jürges
et al., 2008) to harmonize the response formats and count European respondents
who reported ‘Very poor’ or ‘Poor’ health, as well as American respondents reporting
‘Poor’ or ‘Fair’ health as reporting ‘Poor health.’ This left us with poor health
prevalence rates of 15.4 per cent and 10.3 per cent in the US and European samples,
respectively (Table 2).
Education is measured based on the ISCED-1997 classification (UNESCO, 2006).
We distinguish between three key educational groups: Not having completed high
school (ISCED 0–2), high school degree (ISCED 3), and further education (ISCED
4–6). We focus on education as a socioeconomic status indicator for several reasons
(Präg et al., 2017). Firstly, education reflects both individuals’ material and nonmaterial resources and their social status in a broad fashion. Secondly, the ISCED,
with its high degree of cross-national standardization, allows to meaningfully compare educational groups across countries. Thirdly, educational attainment is usually
completed in early adulthood and remains for the most part stable across the life
course, thus reducing the chance of reverse causation: Unlike occupational status,
educational degrees do not change even when an adult experiences a health shock.
Fourthly, compared to income, which usually comes with a large proportion of non-

7

respondents, education is a comparably easy-to-measure indicator of socioeconomic
status. Finally, education is a meaningful measure for the socioeconomic status of
both men and women and for those outside of the labor force.
We use logistic regression models for each country and US state separately to
model the log odds of reporting poor health, adjusted for sex and age. Based on these
models, we predicted probabilities of reporting poor health for those with more than
and less than high school. We then calculated the difference in adjusted prevalence
rates of poor health in the two groups (less than minus more than high school) as a
measure of absolute educational inequalities in SRH. Finally, we calculated the ratio
of the prevalence rates in the two groups (less than over more than high school),
indicating relative educational inequalities in SRH. Ninety-five per cent confidence
intervals (CI’s) were obtained by means of the delta method.

Results
The left panel of Figure 1 presents overall prevalence rates of poor SRH in European countries and US federal states. There is substantial variation, ranging from
3.0 per cent reporting poor health in The Netherlands to 27.8 per cent reporting
poor health in West Virginia. European countries generally exhibit lower prevalence
rates of poor SRH than the US, but this pattern has exceptions. The District of
Columbia ranges among the European countries with a relatively low prevalence
rate of poor health (5.5 per cent), and a number of Eastern European countries,
such as Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine, show prevalence rates in the range of the US
states. In 43 US states, the prevalence rates of poor health were significantly above
the European (EVS) average (dashed line). The right panel of Figure 1 shows the
prevalence of poor SRH among the lower educated. As expected, the prevalence of
poor SRH among the lower educated is substantially higher than in the general population. There are marked differences between the US and Europe, with all states
(except Washington, DC) showing a sometimes manifold higher rate than the European average. Again, it is only the Eastern European countries such as Georgia,
Moldova, and Armenia that have comparable rates of poor health among their lower
educated.
The left panel of Figure 2 shows the rate differences in poor SRH between lower
and higher educated respondents. In North Dakota, for instance, the rate difference
is 11.6 per cent, indicating that the prevalence rate of poor SRH among the lower

educated is 11.6 percentage points higher than among the higher educated. Poor
SRH is generally more prevalent among the lower educated than among the higher
educated. Comparing the absolute inequalities shows that differences are usually
higher in the US, but a substantial number of European countries exhibit rate differences similar to those found in the US. Croatia, Albania, and Slovenia are the
most striking examples for large absolute educational inequalities in SRH in Europe.
All US states (except Washington, DC) exhibited greater rate differences than the
European average. The right panel shows relative educational inequalities in SRH
as expressed by the rate ratio of poor SRH among the lower educated compared
to the higher educated. For example, in Lithuania, the rate ratio amounts to 1.6,
denoting that the lower educated are 60 per cent more likely to report poor health
compared to the higher educated. In a number of countries and states, 95 per cent
confidence intervals of the rate ratios include the value 1, indicating that the point
estimates are not statistically significant at the conventional level. Among those
places where the rate ratio is significantly different from 1, the range is from 1.6 in
Lithuania to 4.8 in Vermont. Again, while a large number of European countries
exhibit substantially lower rate ratios than the US federal states, many European
countries have ratios similar to those of the US, e.g. Croatia (4.6), Norway (4.5), or
Macedonia (4.4). The dashed line indicates that all US states except the District of
Columbia show greater relative educational inequalities in SRH than Europe.

Discussion
Our study generated a number of key messages. Firstly, a comparison of the federal
states of the US shows substantial heterogeneity in the extent of health inequalities
within the US. This is in line with findings of other studies (Chetty et al., 2016;
Murray et al., 2006). However, when comparing the within-US variation with the
variation within Europe, where smaller health inequalities are more common than
in the US, we can see that the potential for reducing health inequalities in the US

is likely bigger than what can be inferred from within-US comparisons only. This
finding underlines the importance of a cross-nationally comparative perspective for
the study of health inequalities.
Secondly, there is a striking resemblance between some Eastern European countries and large parts of the US in terms of inequalities in self-rated health. While
the prevalence of poor self-rated health and educational inequalities in health are
generally greater in the US than in Europe, some of the poorest countries of Europe
show health inequalities and poor health to the same extent as parts of the US.
Our comparison across many rich and poor industrialized countries shows surprising similarities between countries where these would not be expected—for instance,
Bulgaria and Belgium for absolute inequalities—and identifying causes for these patterns will be a challenge for future comparative health research (Mackenbach, 2012;
Präg et al., 2016).
Thirdly, we also show that the poor health prevalence among the lower educated
in the US is much higher than in most European countries. Yet, the share of the
lower educated among the US population is significantly smaller than in Europe.
Thus, only improving the health of the lower educated in the US is unlikely to
eradicate the US health disadvantage to other industrialized countries. In order
to close the gap between the US and the other countries, public health policies to
improve population health have to also target those with medium levels of education.
Fourthly, the patterns found in our study provide important evidence for the
debate about the causes of health inequalities. While public welfare provision is
generally low across the US states, health inequalities vary substantially in size across
states. A possible interpretation for this finding would be that lack of public welfare
provision cannot be the only driver of health inequalities. Research has pointed
out similarities between the health care systems of the US and those of Eastern
Europe. While health care cannot be the only explanation of the US disadvantage
in population health, it might however be an important factor underlying health
12

inequalities. The US suffers from a lack of universal health care access, and some
problems of the health care system in Eastern Europe, like its weakness of primary
care, its specialist orientation, and great fragmentation are also found in the US.
Furthermore, similarities in the often rudimentary conditions of social policies, both
in the US and in Eastern Europe, can provide explanations for the patterns revealed
in this study (Avendano and Kawachi, 2014).
Fifthly, our study points to important directions for future research. Identifying
upstream factors which can account for the differences between countries and states
will be a major challenge for future research. Income inequality has been suggested
to plausibly be a driver of health disparities (Beckfield et al., 2013; Wilkinson and
Pickett, 2008). Creating a comparable database for comprehensive institutional
factors that might serve as explanations not only on the national level, but also on
subnational levels, would be an important next step.
Examining heterogeneity within the US only and not within European countries
is a shortcoming of our study. Yet, although we only contrasted health inequalities
within the US with European countries rather than regions, it became clear that
the variability in health inequalities within the US is rather small in comparison to
European countries. Still, future research should collect data that allow for more
detailed comparisons within Europe. Although the EVS is the largest contemporaneous European micro-dataset in terms of country coverage, the sample sizes within
countries prohibit further breakdowns of the data to subnational levels. Attempts
to use the pooled European Social Survey for breakdowns by region instead also
failed due to the limited sample size.
Given the recent advocacy for global comparisons of health inequalities (Beckfield
et al., 2013; Olafsdottir et al., 2013; Präg et al., 2014), our study serves as a reminder
to not overlook levels of variation within countries and that understanding local
health conditions can give important cues for improving population health.
