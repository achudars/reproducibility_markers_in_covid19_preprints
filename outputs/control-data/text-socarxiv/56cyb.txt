Digital self-harm:
Prevalence, motivations
and outcomes for teens
who cyberbully
themselves
PREPARED BY DR EDGAR PACHECO, NEIL
MELHUISH AND JANDY FISKE

What is this about?
This research report presents findings from an
exploratory study about the extent and nature
of digital self-harm among New Zealand teens.
Digital self-harm is broadly defined here as the
anonymous online posting or sharing of mean
or negative online content about oneself. The
report centres on the prevalence of digital selfharm (or self-cyberbullying) among New
Zealand teens (aged 13-17), the motivations,
and outcomes related to engaging in this
behaviour. The findings described in this
report are representative of the teenage
population of New Zealand by gender,
ethnicity and age.
New Zealand-based research on teens and
online risks and harm has focused on the
nature of peer victimisation incidents such as
the case of cyberbullying and its impact (see
Fenaughty & Harré, 2013; Jose, Kljakovic,
Scheib, & Notter, 2012; Marsh, McGee, NadaRaja, & Williams, 2010). Netsafe has also
contributed to this emerging body of research
by investigating topics such as the impact of
unwanted digital communications on teens,
including their involvement in risky behaviours

Summary of findings
• Overall, 6% of New Zealand teens have
anonymously posted mean or negative
content online about themselves in the
past year.
• Among those teens who engaged in
digital self-harm, most did it more than
once (65%).
• Digital self-harm appears to be more
prevalent among younger teenagers,
those aged 13 and 14 years old.
• Teenagers’ top reasons for this
behaviour were: making a joke, wanting
to show resilience, looking for friends’
sympathy, and seeking reassurance of
friendship.
• Girls and boys pointed out different
reasons for engaging in digital self-harm:
o Girls reported wanting to show
resilience, looking for friends’
sympathy, and seeking reassurance
of friendship.
o Meanwhile, for boys it was mainly
about making a joke.
• There is an indication that digital selfharm is more prevalent among teens
experiencing one or more disabilities.
• About a third of respondents (35%) said
they achieved the outcome they looked
for after digitally self-harming
themselves. This was significantly higher
for boys than girls.
• Teens who did not self-harm believe that
those who did it mainly look for peer
attention and the sympathy from friends.

such as “sexting” (see Pacheco & Melhuish,
2017, 2018c).
As outlined above, investigation about New
Zealand children and teens being the target of
the online aggression of other(s) is increasing.
This is due to concerns that technologymediated abuse can cause emotional distress
and problematic behaviour, and affect
academic achievement at school (Harel-Fisch
et al., 2011) and is possibly linked to
depression (Raskauskas, 2009).
Meanwhile, international media outlets have
been reporting individual cases of young
people’s engagement in technology-mediated
self-harassment1 – also called “selfcyberbullying” (Englander, 2012) or “selftrolling” (Patchin & Hinduja, 2017). However, no
New Zealand studies have explored this topic
until now2. This situation differs from overseas
where some seminal work has been
conducted on the prevalence of this
apparently new behaviour (see Englander,
2012; Patchin & Hinduja, 2017).
The term digital self-harm was first used by
boyd (2010) to describe those teens who “are
self-harassing by ‘anonymously’ writing mean
questions to themselves and then publicly
answering them” (boyd, 2010, para. 3). boyd’s
observations about this phenomenon
originated from anecdotal conversations with
staff from Formspring, a social media platform
that allowed anyone to ask questions to
registered users anonymously. After receiving
complaints from parents about their children
being anonymously bullied online, the platform
found that in some cases the abusive content
had been sent by those children to
themselves. According to boyd, teens’
engagement in digital self-harm appeared to
be, in part, a “cry for help” as they seemed to
want attention, support and validation from
their parents. Another apparent reason was
teens wanting to “look cool” as being exposed
to public criticism can make them look

important. A third explanation was that teens
were looking for compliments and support
from their friends (boyd, 2010).
The following section presents current
research on digital self-harm. These studies
have informed our methodological design.

What we know so far
Current quantitative research on the extent of
digital self-harm is limited to a handful of
overseas studies. One is a 2012 report by
Englander who investigated the prevalence of
digital self-harm among 617 American first-year
college students (18-19 years old). She asked
participants whether they had falsely posted a
cruel remark about themselves during high
school. The study found that 9% of students
said they engaged in this behaviour. The
prevalence was higher among boys (13%) than
girls (8%). According to the study, participants’
main motivation for posting mean online
content about themselves was to gain the
attention of their peers. In addition, those who
engaged in this behaviour were more likely to
be frequent users of drugs and alcohol
(Englander, 2012). Recently, Englander has
estimated that the prevalence of digital selfharm or self-cyberbullying, as she also calls it,
has not only increased compared to her 2012
study but has consistently remained around
15% in the last three years (Englander, 2017).
Another American study (see Patchin &
Hinduja, 2017) found that around 6% of
students have anonymously posted online
mean content about themselves at any point in
time. In contrast with Englander’s (2012)
research, this study was based on nationally
representative data of students aged 12-17
years old. Patchin and Hinduja (2017) also
found that digital self-harm was more common
among males (7.1%) than females (5.3%) and
that non-heterosexual teens were three times
more likely to have done it compared to their
heterosexual peers. However, the authors did
not find a significant link between this

However, like overseas, media and research interest has concentrated on traditional forms of self-harm which include inflicting self-injury
(e.g. cutting or burning). See https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/108558122/why-are-our-girls-hurting-themselves

behaviour and age or race. Finally, the study
also found a relationship between digital selfharm and depression, offline self-harm, and
bullying (Patchin & Hinduja, 2017).
As previously mentioned, there is no New
Zealand-based research on digital self-harm.
We believe that by exploring the nature and
extent of this behaviour, Netsafe is providing
the online safety community, schools and
parents with insights about a complex and, to
some extent, hidden phenomenon involving
New Zealand teens. However, we also
understand that more interdisciplinary work is
needed to understand this phenomenon in
order to provide support to those young
people who engage in this behaviour, their
families and communities.

What we did
This digital self-harm report is part of a larger
research project exploring New Zealand
children and teens’ experiences of online
opportunities, risks and challenges3. The
project also includes the views of
parents/caregivers.
An online survey was the research instrument
used for this project. Quantitative data were
collected between 20 July and 30 September
2018. The survey was administered by Colmar
Brunton. This report only presents findings
about questions related to digital self-harm
asked of teenage participants aged 13-17 years
old (n=1110). Our decision to focus on
teenagers was supported by prior research
that suggests young people in this age range
are more likely to engage in self-harming
behaviours and be more active online (Lewis,
Heath, Michal, & Duggan, 2012). The maximum
margin of error of this study for the whole
sample is +/- 2.9% at 95% confidence level.
The maximum margin of error of this study for
the whole sample is +/- 2.9% at 95%
confidence level.

The objective of this study was to explore the
prevalence of digital self-harm among teens,
their self-reported motivations, and the
outcomes related to engaging in this
behaviour. Our working definition of digital
self-harm was4:

The anonymous online posting or sharing
of mean or negative online content about
oneself.
This definition situates digital self-harm as a
behaviour rather than as an illness or disorder.
This is because a range of underlying factors
might explain this behaviour from family issues
to psychological aspects and physical illness
(Skegg, 2005).
As mentioned, data collected for this study are
broadly representative of New Zealand
teenagers in terms of age, gender, ethnicity,
and region. In our sample, 16% of teenagers
indicated having a disability, which included
one or more experiences of a physical
disability, physical illness, learning difficulty,
and/or mental health difficulty.
While this study provides relevant insights
about an unexplored topic in New Zealand, it
also has limitations. There is a possibility that
participants did not answer honestly about
their engagement in digital self-harm, because,
for example, they feel embarrassed about their
actions. This sort of challenge is common in
research that relies on self-reported data. In
addition, research on offline self-harm
suggests that young people tend not to
disclose their behaviour (Armiento, Hamza, &
Willoughby, 2014). We managed these
challenges by guaranteeing participants that
their responses were anonymous. Due to the
nature of the questions we also provided links
to support services in case the young people
participating in the survey wished to seek
advice or help.

This definition as well as our research approach were informed by available research and analysis conducted overseas (see boyd, 2010;
Englander, 2012; Patchin & Hinduja, 2017).

What we found
This section presents the main findings of the
study including insights based on key
demographics, when relevant. Also, as the
Approved Agency under the Harmful Digital
Communications Act 2015, Netsafe holds
unique professional and operational
experience within the online safety domain.
For this reason, we asked our Contact Centre
team, which directly and daily deals with a
number of technology-mediated incidents
affecting New Zealanders, to contribute with
comments on the findings and to reflect on
their implications which are included in this
section.

FREQUENCY OF DIGITAL SELF-HARM
The digital self-harm questionnaire started by
asking the 1110 teenage research participants
(aged 13-17) whether they have anonymously
posted or shared online mean or harmful
content about themselves in the past year.

Of the teenagers who engaged in digital selfharm in the last year (n=66) most had done so
more than once. Specifically, our results show
that 57% anonymously posted mean online
content about themselves “A few times (2-4
times)” while 8% did so “Many times (5 or more
times)”. Teens who engaged in this behaviour
only once represented 35% – see Figure 2.

To measure prevalence our response scale
included: “Never”, “Once”, “A few times (2-4
times)”, “Many times (5 or more times)”, “I don’t
know”, and “Don’t want to answer”.

After aggregating participants’ responses, our
data show that a large majority of participants
(87%) said they did not engage in digital selfharming. However, 6% indicated they posted
anonymously negative comments about
themselves while the remaining 7% said they
did not know or did not want to answer the
question – see Figure 1.

The difference regarding gender was not
statistically significant in our results. However,
it is noteworthy that the prevalence of digital
self-harm was slightly higher among boys (7%)
than girls (5%) – see Figure 3 for details.

Interestingly, our findings also reveal some
differences regarding the prevalence of digital
self-harm among specific age groups. For
example, the percentage of younger
teenagers, those aged 13 and 14 years old,
who engaged in digital self-harm was 7% and
9%, respectively5. From there the trend started
to decrease. The prevalence of digital selfharm for 15-year-olds was 6%, and 5% for
those aged 16 years old. A lower occurrence
of digital self-harm was registered among 17
years old (4%). See Figure 4 for further details.
Note that the labels “Don’t know” and “Don’t
want to answer” are not included to facilitate
graphical interpretation of the frequency of
digital self-harm by age.

Our data does not show significant differences
in regard to ethnicity.
On the other hand, while our data are not
representative of the teenage population with
a disability, there is an indication from the
findings that teens experiencing one or more
disability are more likely to engage in digital
self-harm, in particular those teens having a
physical disability, a behavioural disability and
mental health issue6.
MOTIVATIONS FOR DIGITAL SELFHARM
We also wanted to explore the motivations of
the teens that reported digital self-harming in
the past year. This involved asking these
participants the question: “What was the
reason(s) that motivated you to post or share
anonymously mean or harmful content online
against yourself?”. To answer the question,
participants were presented with a list of
possible reasons. They were able to choose
one or more options.

Note the error for this age-related data is 4.2% (at 10%/90% agreement).

Note that teenage participants in our survey were not directly asked whether they have a disability. We asked their parents this question.

According to the teens who engaged in digital
self-harm the four top reasons explaining their
behaviour were: making a joke (33%), wanting
to show others “I could take it” (24%), looking
for friends’ sympathy (23%), and wanting to
know if someone was “really my friend” (22%)
– further details are given in Table 1.

Interesting differences were found regarding
teens’ gender. For boys (41%), engagement in
digital self-harm to make a joke was
significantly higher than girls (21%). However,
in relation to other top reasons, it was more
common among girls to say that they
anonymously posted mean content online to
show others “I can take it” (29%), look for their
friends’ sympathy (31%), and seek reassurance
of friendship (29%). Boys rated these reasons
significantly lower – see Table 2 for further
details.

SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING THE DESIRED

Participants who shared mean/harmful content
online about themselves were also asked
about the outcomes of their behaviour.
Specifically, we asked them whether they
achieved what they wanted after posting the
mean content online.

As Figure 5 shows, just over a third of these
participants (35%) responded “Yes”.
Meanwhile, 33% indicated they did not achieve
the outcome they looked for. Those who said
they did not know or did not want to answer
the question comprised 32% of the results.
Interestingly, boys and girls reported different
outcomes regarding the sharing of mean
content online about themselves. The
percentage of boys (48%) indicating they
achieved what they wanted was significantly
higher compared to girls (16%). This result
might be explained by the motivation behind
this behaviour reported by boys, who
indicated that, in most cases, the action(s) was
a joke. The differences between boys and girls
are highlighted in Figure 6.

The insights from this question show a

getting peers’ attention (42%) and receiving
their friends’ sympathy (41%). These results
contrast with the responses from those who

ENGAGEMENT IN DIGITAL SELF-HARM
The last question explored teens’ perceived
reasons for why other people would engage in
this behaviour. Only those teenage
participants who said they did not post

about themselves?”. The response scale used

Contact centre
reflections on cases
and queries
Since November 2016 Netsafe's contact
centre team has received two reports of
cases known to involve self-cyberbullying,
and several in which it may have been
involved. We also have received a few
queries about the topic from concerned
parents. However, this is a much lower
reporting rate compared to other online risks
young people experience such as abuse or
harassment.
In both confirmed cases the teenagers
involved clearly experienced a high degree
of distress and/or harm. However, it was also
apparent that their self-cyberbullying
behaviours were just one aspect of a more
complex situation involving a range of online
and offline factors.
In our experience parents and other
caregivers cannot always determine whether
this is in fact self-inflicted behaviour.
Sometimes, as impartial observers
experienced in understanding and
addressing online risks and challenges, the
contact centre team are better placed to
identify where self-cyberbullying may be
occurring. However, rather than ‘calling out’
that behaviour, which the teen and/or those
around them may not want to admit to, we
instead try to focus on helping that person
change how they are interacting online
which is more constructive in the long term.
Finally, perhaps because of the lack of cases
we have received, this research has raised
Netsafe’s awareness of this phenomenon,
and the need to develop our understanding
of what is involved.

Concluding remarks
This report has presented findings from an
exploratory study about the prevalence of
digital self-harm among New Zealand teens,
including the motivations and outcomes
related to engaging in this behaviour.
Based on data collected from a nationally
representative sample, the study found that
6% of New Zealand teens aged 13-17 years old
have anonymously posted mean or negative
content online about themselves in the past
year7. It is noteworthy to mention that digital
self-harm or self-cyberbullying was slightly
more common among boys compared to girls
and that prevalence was particularly higher
among 14-year-old teens (9%), and lower
among their peers aged 17 years old (4%).
Findings about teens’ reasons for engaging in
digital self-harm are also revealing. Those who
posted mean content online about themselves
pointed out that they mainly did it as a joke,
wanted to show resilience, looked for friends’
sympathy, and/or sought reassurance of
friendship among other reasons. However,
and more interestingly, there are distinctive
differences in girls’ and boys’ motivations. For
girls, engagement in this behaviour seems
motivated by the need (and perhaps pressure)
for peer recognition and validation but also the
consolidation of close social connections. In
this respect, and as our data describe, wanting
to show others that they can take aggression
online or wanting to make sure someone else
was indeed their friend were motivations rated
higher by girls. In contrast, for boys, making a
joke was largely the reason behind digital selfharm. At first glance, boys’ behaviour can be
seen as a naïve act. However, it is also
plausible that seeking to be funny or cool
might also be another form of looking for peer
attention and validation. In short, teens’
motivations for digital self-harm vary but they
seem to fall under the scope of looking for
support and attention.

This percentage is similar to an American study which also relied on data from a representative sample (see Patchin & Hinduja, 2017).

Young people’s internet safety is a critical
issue not only for parents but also broader
society. However, while digital tools provide
young people with a range of opportunities for
learning, socialising and being informed
among others (Pacheco & Melhuish, 2018a),
there are risks and potential harm due to their
use and misuse. As previous Netsafe research
shows, the negative impact of harmful digital
communications is higher among young
people compared to adults (Pacheco &
Melhuish, 2018c). Thus, supporting teens to
develop healthy online behaviours is also key
for their general safety and wellbeing.
In such a context, this study provides insights
about a type of behaviour that, until now, had
received little attention in New Zealand. The
fact that there is a group of teens engaging in
digital self-harm or self-cyberbullying for
different reasons demands raising awareness
about this phenomenon and reflecting on its
implications.
As teenagers go through a complex process of
personal development and identity formation,
understanding their behaviour can help to
comprehend teenagers’ everyday
experiences, needs, and concerns. In this
respect, prior Netsafe research shows that
parents and friends are young people’s first
line of support when they face an online risk or
challenge (Pacheco & Melhuish, 2018b). Thus,
by being aware and informed about this
behaviour, we will be able to provide them
with the attention they look and ask for
through this anonymous behaviour.
However, we also need to be aware that
technology allows teens (and adults) to easily
construct multiple online personas and
identities for different purposes such as selfpresentation and self-promotion (Belk, 2013;
van Dijck, 2013). As this study shows, this
includes self-cyberbullying where teens
essentially put on a ‘mask’ to the outside world
enabling them to post anonymous negative
content while presenting themselves as the
apparent target of others’ online aggression.
This makes identifying and managing incidents

8

of digital self-harm among teenagers a
challenging task. Also, it is difficult to
determine whether these teens experience
any harm as a result of their actions. All these
issues make digital self-harm more likely to be
involuntarily misunderstood and/or reported as
a case of cyberbullying or another form of
peer victimisation by parents, friends, teachers
or support services. Furthermore, we need to
consider the collateral effect of digital selfharm such as the distress that parents and
friends might experience once they realise
that the young person they care for is selfcyberbullying. Another issue is, as Stanford
(2017) points out, that there seems to be
concerns in society that talking about selfharm in general will encourage this behaviour
among young people.
Similarly, it is necessary to understand that
while technology-mediated abuse can be the
means for self-harm (Hay & Meldrum, 2010),
technology can also play a therapeutic role8 or
provide young people with access to peer
support networks to mitigate harmful
behaviours (Daine et al., 2013; Lewis et al.,
2012). The latter seems to be, in part, the case
in our study as a third of those who engaged
in digital self-harm reported they had received
the attention and support they were looking
for after posting negative content online.
While this study contributes to the body of
knowledge, further research is still needed.
Our contribution to the literature and practice
is in raising awareness of the prevalence,
motivations and outcomes of digital self-harm
on the basis of key demographics. However,
there is still a need for research about risk
factors such as family issues, socio-economic
disadvantage, social and cultural aspects, and
psychological and health issues (e.g.
depression, substance abuse, and anxiety
disorders) which have only been explored in
the context of traditional forms of offline selfharm (see Skegg, 2005). Studying all or part of
these aspects is a next research step to better
understand the nature and extent of digital
self-harm in New Zealand.
