Standing Out and Sorting In:
Exploring the Role of Racial Composition in
Racial Disparities in Special Education
Rachel Elizabeth Fish
New York University
Schools differentially sort students into special education by race, though
researchers debate the extent to which this is caused by racist school practices
versus variation in student need due to other racial inequalities. I test the
interaction between school-level racial composition and student-level race
as a predictor of special education receipt. I find that as the proportion of
White students increases, the risk of lower-status disabilities, such as intellectual disability, increases for Black, Latinx, and Native American students. As
the proportion of White students decreases, White students’ risk of higherstatus disabilities, such as speech/language impairment, increases relative
to students of color. Thus, in the context of racial distinctiveness, student
race becomes salient to sorting into special education.

T

he disproportionate rates of special education receipt by students from
low-income and racial minority backgrounds in the United States has
been documented since at least the late 1960s (Dunn, 1968; Mercer, 1973).
Moreover, racial disparities vary between the 13 federally defined educational disabilities, with some of the greatest disproportionality occurring in
emotional disturbance and intellectual disability (U.S. Department of
Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, &
Office of Special Education Programs, 2015); relative to other categories of
disability, these categories are associated with greater social stigma and

higher rates of segregation from peers without disabilities (Blanchett, 2010;
U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative
Services, & Office of Special Education Programs, 2015). Education policy,
the U.S. justice system, and a large body of research treat the ‘‘overrepresentation’’ of students of color in special education as likely evidence of bias and
inappropriate identification of students of color (Donovan & Cross, 2002;
Losen & Welner, 2001; Oswald, Coutinho, Best, & Nguyen, 2001; Skiba,
Poloni-Staudinger, Simmons, Feggins-Azziz, & Choong-Geun, 2005). Yet
some new research challenges previous conclusions of racial bias by examining the relation between race and disability in light of confounders (e.g.,
socioeconomic status) and by better accounting for the nested nature of students within school contexts (Hibel, Farkas, & Morgan, 2010; MacMillan &
Reschly, 1998; Morgan et al., 2015; Shifrer, 2018; Shifrer, Muller, &
Callahan, 2011). This research suggests that students of color are not overrepresented at all, but rather they may actually be underrepresented in special education once confounders are taken into account (Hibel et al., 2010;
Morgan et al., 2015). However, other research suggests that the relation
between race and risk of special education receipt depends on the disability
category, as children of color have greater risk than White children when
they exhibit behavioral challenges, and White children have greater risk
than children of color when they exhibit academic challenges (Fish, 2017).
A growing body of research examines the role of school context in the
production or reduction of racial inequalities in special education, focusing
on racial composition as a potential explanation for racial disparities in special education receipt (Bal, Betters-Bubon, & Fish, 2017; Eitle, 2002; Hibel
et al., 2010; Sullivan & Bal, 2013). Most of this research has treated school
racial composition as a potential confounder of race effects—one that would
have universal effects on all students’ risk of special education. Yet it is likely
that the racial context of the school, which has been shown to shape withinschool racial inequalities such as sorting into tracks (e.g., Lucas & Berends,
2002), might have different effects on risk of special education receipt by
race.
Understanding the nature of the relationship between race and educational disability has important implications beyond the question of whether
schools are inappropriately placing children in special education due to
racially biased practices (Skiba et al., 2005) or whether they are merely
responding to broader racial inequalities that increase the need for special
services among children of color (Shifrer et al., 2011). This empirical question is certainly important for understanding racial disparities among students with educational disabilities, who make up 13% of public school
students and are largely served in general education classrooms (National
Center for Education Statistics, 2017; U.S. Department of Education, Office
of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, & Office of Special
Education Programs, 2015). Yet this question also has the potential to
2

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
contribute to theoretical understanding of the often-neglected intersection of
race and disability (Erevelles & Minear, 2010). Examining racial disparities in
special education receipt provides a window into one mechanism of ‘‘categorical inequality’’ (Domina, Penner, & Penner, 2017), in which schools sort
children into different categories of disability and into different services. This
sorting likely allocates many beneficial resources to students that need them
most. However, it may also exacerbate racial inequalities by creating structures for opportunity hoarding, shaping incentives and student motivation,
affecting identity formation, and creating lasting status distinctions
(Domina et al., 2017), particularly for the medicalized categories of educational disabilities.
In this article, I expand on existing empirical studies of inequality in special education by testing the cross-level interaction between school-level
racial composition and student-level race, predicting sorting into special
education under different categories of educational disability. I use a large
data set of all students in Wisconsin, allowing for the nuanced examination
of variation across the more subjective, higher-incidence disability categories. The data set also allows for examination of racial differences including
Native American students, who are often excluded from analyses due to
sample constraints. I seek to reveal how race intersects with schools’ construction of disability categories and to understand how schools sort into
these categories.

The Social Context of Disability
Mainstream practitioners, policymakers, and scholars generally conceive
of educational disabilities as individual-level neurophysiological pathologies
with clear boundaries between categories of disability (Dudley-Marling,
2004; Reid & Knight, 2006; Reid & Valle, 2004). Yet this framing ignores
the ways in which disability is also socially constructed (McDonald, Keys,
& Balcazar, 2007) and driven by institutional practice (Mehan, Hertweck,
& Meihls, 1986) and by the medicalization of underperformance (Conrad,
1976). Subjectivity infuses all steps of the special education placement process, from teacher referrals (Brinkman et al., 2009; Cormier, 2012; Lloyd,
Kauffman, Landrum, & Roe, 1991; Sax, 2003), to psycho-educational testing
and interpretations of that testing (Mehan et al., 1986), to team meetings to
determine eligibility (Harry & Klingner, 2007). This subjectivity allows biases,
preferences, politics, and other individual and contextual factors to shape
which students are seen as having disabilities. Moreover, indicators of
some disability categories partially overlap with one another, creating grey
areas of qualification where social factors could affect the particular category
that is diagnosed (Eyal, 2013; Liu, King, & Bearman, 2010; Ong-Dean, 2009).
For instance, both speech/language disorder and intellectual disability can
be characterized by language-processing challenges; similarly, both autism
3

Fish
spectrum disorder and emotional disturbance might be diagnosed due to
social and behavioral challenges (Smith & Tyler, 2015). As a result, team
decisions of diagnosis are based not only on assessment tools but are also
subject to the discretion of individuals, allowing social factors to affect these
bureaucratic decisions (Lipsky, 1971).
An essentialist and medicalized framing also treats racial disparities in
special education as mere variation in incidence, missing the intersectional
relation between disability and race as categories that co-construct one
another (Erevelles & Minear, 2010). A focus on the social context of disability
does not negate the real academic, behavioral, and social challenges experienced by students identified with disabilities. Rather, it casts a critical
lens on the line dividing students diagnosed with disabilities from those
with uncategorized, nonmedicalized low performance or social/behavioral
challenges and allows for the examination of how individual and contextual
factors might affect disability diagnosis.
A subset of educational disabilities is generally considered more subjective than ‘‘hard disabilities’’ (e.g., D/deafness, blindness, and orthopedic
impairment): autism spectrum disorder, emotional disturbance, intellectual
disability (including only mild intellectual disability, the majority of intellectual disability diagnoses; Garfunkel, Kaczorowski, & Christy, 2007), other
health impairment (includes a wide range of health needs that can affect
learning but is most commonly for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
[ADHD]; Grice, 2002), specific learning disability, and speech-language
impairment (Connor, 2005; Donovan & Cross, 2002). I focus on these categories as the subjectivity allows for greater influence of social factors on special education placement decisions, allowing for examination of school- and
student-level variation in how students are sorted into special education.
Social Status of Disability
Special education is generally understood and treated as a social good,
a civil right that students with disabilities were not guaranteed until 1975
(U.S. Department of Education & Office of Special Education and
Rehabilitative Services, 2010). Indeed, these services have expanded access
and improved educational programming for children with disabilities. Yet
disability identification and the provision of special education services
may also reify a core axis of societal inequality by ability, as students experience stigma, isolation from peers, lower teacher expectations, and less
access to higher-level content (Dudley-Marling, 2004; Gillung & Rucker,
1977; Morgan, Frisco, Farkas, & Hibel, 2010; Shifrer, Callahan, & Muller,
2013). Cognitive and behavioral abilities, broadly defined, are valued to
the extent that people with disabilities are seen as ‘‘pathological and incompetent,’’ deserving exclusion from social life (McDonald et al., 2007). As

4

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
a result, not having a disability generally affords a person higher social status
than having a disability.
Status differences also exist between categories of disability (Thomas,
2000; Tringo, 1970). Delineating this social hierarchy is useful for understanding how schools sort students into disability categories. While scholars
typically infer disability status differentiation from other social statuses (i.e.,
by race and socioeconomic status) of the populations that are more likely to
be identified with them (Blanchett, 2010; Ong-Dean, 2006; Sleeter, 1987), I
define disability statuses in terms of variation in stigma, the types of services
provided, the extent of exclusion from the general education classroom, and
parental preferences for particular disability diagnoses. The typology presented here is not based on the specific criteria for qualification, the presentation of the disabilities, or the assessment procedures used for each
diagnosis. I define three disability categories as higher status: other health
impairment, speech-language impairment, and autism spectrum disorder;
two categories as lower status: emotional disturbance and intellectual disability; and one disability category as stratified status: specific learning
disability.
Higher-Status Disability Categories
The three disabilities conceptualized as higher-status categories of disability are (1) other health impairment, which most frequently serves as
the label for ADHD (Grice, 2002); (2) speech/language impairment, which
refers to both speech impairments and language-processing deficits: and
(3) autism spectrum disorder, which refers to social and communication
impairments. These disabilities are associated with lower stigma among disability categories and more advantageous services than other categories
(Blanchett, 2010; Harry & Anderson, 1994; Ong-Dean, 2009), such as more
inclusion in the general education classroom, which provides them with
more access to grade-level content and social experiences with peers without disabilities (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education
and Rehabilitative Services, & Office of Special Education Programs, 2015).
For many presentations of these disabilities, these categories are defined
and popularly perceived as having no relation to intelligence, or even having
a positive relation to intelligence in contrast to other disabilities (Brown,
2011; Charman et al., 2011; Grandin, 2008). Research suggests that families
with more resources may advocate for autism over intellectual disability
and specific learning disability (Eyal, 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Ong-Dean,
2009), prefer ADHD (typically under the disability category of other health
impairment) to mere ‘‘underperformance’’ (Conrad, 1976), and medicate
ADHD strategically under academic pressure (King, Jennings, & Fletcher,
2014). In the case of speech/language impairments, students are exited
from special education at a relatively high rate (Special Education
5

Fish
Longitudinal Study, 2005), suggesting a transitory need in contrast to the permanence of other categories.
Lower-Status Disability Categories
On the opposite end of the spectrum, two categories have lower status
than the others: (1) emotional disturbance, a category defined by excessive
problem behavior, and (2) intellectual disability, which refers to a deficit in
the highly valued characteristic of intelligence, indicated by a combination of
low IQ and challenges with adaptive behavior such as self-care. Both these
categories are associated with greater social stigma than other disabilities
(Blanchett, 2010; Harry & Anderson, 1994; Ong-Dean, 2009), which has
implications for how teachers, peers, and future employers will see the student. Emotional disturbance is associated with juvenile incarceration
(Rutherford, Bullis, & Anderson, 2002), and the label suggests that the child
will likely disrupt teachers’ classes. Intellectual disability is perceived as
pathological incompetence and low status relative to other types of disability
(McDonald et al., 2007; Thomas, 2000; Tringo, 1970). Students with these
disabilities are excluded from the general education classroom at higher
rates than their peers with other disabilities, reducing their access to
grade-level content and isolating them from peers exhibiting low academic
performance and/or problematic behaviors (U.S. Department of Education,
Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, & Office of Special
Education Programs, 2015).
Stratified-Status Disability Category
Specific learning disability refers to students who do not meet grade-level
standards in one or more areas yet whose deficits are unexplained by any
other disabilities or lack of appropriate instruction (Wisconsin Department
of Public Instruction, n.d.). This disability confers higher status to some students and lower status to others (Blanchett, 2010; Ong-Dean, 2006); thus, I
conceptualize it as a stratified-status disability. Specific learning disability
rose in popularity as a way for more advantaged families to explain low performance (Blanchett, 2010; Ong-Dean, 2006; Sleeter, 1987) and is preferred by
families over intellectual disability (Gottlieb & Alter, 1994). Over time, incidence of specific learning disability has increased among students of color
(Ong-Dean, 2006). Yet while the category has maintained higher status for students with more advantages—providing extra resources, a destigmatizing
label, and the presumption of normal or superior intelligence—disadvantaged
students likely receive few of those benefits (Blanchett, 2010; Ong-Dean,
2006). Rather the category may simply be a ‘‘dumping ground for children
of color’’ who do not qualify for intellectual disability (Blanchett, 2010).
Presumably, parents, teachers, and children perceive ‘‘naturally’’ high
achievement without disability as the most desired ability status. Yet among
6

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
students who are struggling in school, it is arguably better to be labeled with
a higher-status disability that provides accommodations, extra support from
teachers, and a medicalized explanation for low performance (Conrad, 1976)
than to be seen as nondisabled yet simply unmotivated or underperforming.
The lower-status disability categories, then, are arguably the least desired
among these possible categorizations of students, as they imply out-ofcontrol behavior or low intelligence and are most likely to exclude children
from the general education classroom.

Race, Racial Composition, and Sorting Into Special Education
Among students exhibiting academic and social-behavioral challenges,
how do schools sort students into categories of disability? Subjectivity in
the process of identifying disabilities allows social factors, such as race
and school racial composition, to affect referral, eligibility, the type of disability diagnosis, and placement into services. Existing research shows that
racial bias and parental pressure affect teachers’ decisions to refer students
to special education testing, testing processes, and team decisions to qualify
students for special education services (Fish, 2017; Harry & Klingner, 2007). I
argue that in addition to these individual-level factors, racial composition is
likely to affect which students are identified with disabilities and thus receive
special education services.
Decisions to place students in special education likely parallel other
within-school sorting processes meant to specialize educational programming, such as tracks, ability groups, and gifted programs, in which racial
composition moderates both the extent of tracking and racial disparities
(Braddock, 1990; Lucas & Berends, 2002; Mickelson, 2001; Oakes, 1985;
Sleeter, 1987; Staiger, 2004). Research also suggests that racial composition
moderates racial patterns of exclusionary disciplinary procedures
(Edwards, 2016), in which students are sorted out of the classroom, and
likely paralleling special education receipt for emotional disturbance (Bal
et al., 2017). Existing research on racial disproportionality in special education that examines school context, however, generally examines universal
effects of school racial composition. In other words, most of these studies
assume that schools with different racial compositions may have different
practices around special education but that these practices have the same
effects on all students’ risk of special education receipt regardless of race.
This research has produced mixed findings on the effects of school racial
composition (Bal et al., 2017; Hibel et al., 2010; Sullivan & Bal, 2013).
Among studies on racial disproportionality in special education, only
two (Eitle, 2002; Shifrer, 2018) go beyond universal effects of school racial
composition, examining the relation between racial composition and racial
disparities in special education receipt. Of these studies, only Shifrer’s
(2018) accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data of students nested
7

Fish
in schools, and both these studies examine single disability categories.
Shifrer’s (2018) findings suggest a statistically nonsignificant interaction
between school racial composition and student race, but the estimates are
suggestive of higher risk of disability identification for students who are
racially distinct in their schools. Eitle’s (2002) findings support theories that
special education facilitates within-school racial segregation in reaction to
racial integration (Eitle, 2002; Ferri & Connor, 2005; Mccall & Skrtic, 2009).
She suggests that racial composition may engender racial competition and
political mobilization by parents, shaping who is identified with educational
disabilities. Other plausible mechanisms include the possibility that school
racial composition moderates the salience of racial stereotypes, which affect
teachers’ suspicions of disability (Fish, 2017), as well as the possibility that
school racial composition might affect the social-psychological and academic
well-being of students of color (Goldsmith, 2004; Hanselman, Bruch,
Gamoran, & Borman, 2014; Tyson, William Darity, & Castellino, 2005), which,
in turn, affect the need for special education services. The existing research
leaves open many questions about what these patterns of race, composition,
and special education are for a wider range of disability categories and how
students are sorted into different categories of disability.

Research Question
In this article, I test the role of school racial composition as a moderator
of the relation between race and special education receipt, examining variation by disability category. While previous research has largely examined
student-level race and school-level racial composition as predictors of special education receipt, I test the cross-level interaction of school racial composition and student race. These analyses aim to reveal how schools sort
students into these categories, shedding light on the role of special education
in racial stratification, and the intersection of disability and race.

Data and Measurement
This research uses data from Wisconsin, a state with a wide range of
racial compositions in its schools and notable racial inequalities in education, specifically special education (Vanneman, Hamilton, Anderson, &
Rahman, 2009). I use a data set from the Wisconsin Department of
Instruction that includes all 895,791 students in all 2,214 schools in 2010–
2011. Compared with the data used in previous research on contextual
effects in racial disproportionality in special education, the focal data set
has significant advantages, most important a very large population, rather
than a representative sample. The sizeable numbers of students in individual
disability categories allow for the estimation of categories excluded in some
previous research. Because students in prekindergarten and Grades 2, 9, 11,
8

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
and 12 do not receive scores through the Wisconsin Student Assessment
System, I exclude these students from analyses that include individual
achievement test scores; this adjustment results in a population of 429,488
students in 2,214 schools.
The dependent variables in this study are dichotomous variables of
whether a student received special education services in the 2010–2011
school year (0 = did not receive services; 1 = received services), including
an aggregate outcome of any disability as well as outcomes for each of
the more subjective categories of disability discussed above (autism spectrum disorder, emotional disturbance, intellectual disability, other health
impairment, specific learning disability, or speech/language impairment).
The raw data showing the percentage of each racial group receiving services
under each disability category are available in Table 1. These data show that
Black and Native American students are almost twice as likely as White students to receive special education services under any disability category.
Black students outpace White students in receipt of special education under
every category except for autism spectrum disorder, and Native American
students also receive services at higher levels than White students across
all categories. Latinx students’ rates of receipt are less consistent across categories, while Asian students receive special education services at lower
rates across all categories.
Descriptive statistics can be found in Table 2. The student-level independent variables of greatest interest are those for race, represented by dichotomous measures for all available racial categories in the data: Asian, Black,
Latinx, Native American, and White (0 = White). I include as individual-level
controls all available measures that might confound the relation between
race and special education receipt. English-language learner (ELL) status
(0 = non-ELL; 1 = ELL) is associated with race and with both increased
and decreased risk of special education receipt, as ELLs who struggle academically are more likely to receive English as a second-language programs
—without special education services—when they are younger and more
likely than their peers to receive special education when they are older
(Hibel & Jasper, 2012) and is included as a dichotomous variable.
Socioeconomic status, discussed above as a potential confounder, is
included via free/reduced-price lunch (FRL) status (0 = non-FRL; 1 = FRL).
Risk of different disabilities varies by grade level (Shifrer & Fish, 2015);
thus, grade level is included, ranging from 3 to 10 in all models that use
this variable, as these are the only grade levels in which students took academic proficiency tests. Gender is associated with special education receipt
(Coutinho, Oswald, & Best, 2002) and is included as a dichotomous measure
(0 = female; 1 = male). Attendance, which is associated with student performance that might affect risk of special education receipt, is measured as percent of days attended, was grand mean centered, and ranges from 294.5 to
5.5. Student mobility is included through a dichotomous variable of whether

the student transferred schools in the past academic year (0 = did not transfer; 1 = transferred). Math and reading achievement measures are reported
from the statewide achievement test, the Wisconsin Knowledge and
Concepts Examinations, and range from 1 to 4 (1 = minimal performance,
2 = basic, 3 = proficient, and 4 = advanced). The proficiency levels are
used because full test scores are not available. Only 2.50% of all students
are missing test scores; among students with disabilities this missingness
ranges from 2.48% for autism spectrum disorder to 6.22% for emotional disturbance. Some students with significant deficits in cognitive functioning,
11

Fish
adaptive behavior, and academic functioning are eligible to take an alternative test in lieu of the standardized tests; thus, the small numbers of missing
data represent students with the most significant impairments. These data
are excluded via listwise deletion, perhaps producing more conservative
estimates. However, the outcome of interest focuses on students that have
less significant, more subjectively diagnosed disabilities, who are unlikely
to fall into the population of students that qualify for the alternative
assessment.
The school-level independent variable of interest is the school racial composition, operationalized as the school proportion White. Although interactions between a student’s race and the composition of same-race peers is
also arguably of interest, such a measurement disregards the likely important
role of White versus non-White peers, particularly with regard to racial marginalization within the school. School-level controls include aggregated measures of the individual-level variables for proportion ELL, proportion qualifying
for FRL, as well as the mean proficiency level for math and reading tests
(ranges from 1 to 4) and the school-level proportion of teachers of color,
the proportion of teachers with masters’ degrees, and the proportion of bilingual teachers are included, as all these may confound the relation between
racial composition and racial disparities in special education receipt.

Analytic Method
I estimate the risk of special education receipt overall and the risk of
receipt under each disability category through multilevel mixed-effects logistic
regression models, which account for the nested nature of the student-level
data within school-level data and allow for estimation of the binary outcomes.
I use the xtmelogit command in Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp LP, 2013), with
a random intercept for schools, and the Laplace approximation for improved
computation time. The reference category in each model is ‘‘no disability.’’
The mixed-effects model predicting special education receipt is as
follows:

logit pij 5b0 1b1 Xij 1b2 Xj 1uj

Here, the outcome pij is a binary indicator of whether student i receives special education receipt in school j, b1Xij is a vector of all student-level variables (described above), b2Xj is a vector of all school-level variables
(described above), and uj is the random effect for schools in this two-level
random intercept model. Supplemental preliminary analyses (see supplementary tables in the online version of the journal) include a set of hierarchical models that build to the full models used in this study, allowing for
a comparison of the results from this study with previous work on the relation of race to risk of special education receipt. Preliminary Model 1 includes
12

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
gender and race at the individual level, to examine the disparities in incidence demonstrated by much of the literature (Coutinho et al., 2002).
Preliminary Model 2 adds the remaining individual-level variables and
school-level variables, allowing for a comparison with studies that include
potential confounders using national datasets, especially those that examine
school context (e.g., Hibel et al., 2010). The final model is the full model
used for this study, which adds interactions between individual-level race
and school-level racial composition to identify how race effects on the
model vary by school racial composition.

Results
Results are reported in terms of the coefficients and, for more intuitive
interpretation of logistic regression results, the exponentiated coefficients
(baseline odds for constants, odds ratios for individual- and school-level
covariates, and the ratios of odds ratios for interactions).1 See Table 3 for
these estimates, and see Supplemental Tables 1 to 7 for the preliminary hierarchical models replicating the previous research on race and disability
(available in the online version of the journal). The results are presented
most intuitively in Figures 1 to 7, which illustrate the predicted probabilities
of each disability outcome by school proportion White, at the mean value for
all other covariates in that model. The predicted probabilities were computed via the margins command in Stata version 13.0.
All Disabilities
The preliminary models (Supplemental Table 1), which replicate the previous research (e.g., Coutinho et al., 2002), suggest that when only race and gender are included in the model (Model 1, Supplemental Table 1), Black, Latinx,
and Native American students have higher odds of special education receipt
than their White peers, while Asian students have lower odds than their
White peers. Model 2 (Supplemental Table 1), which replicates research using
a richer set of covariates (e.g., Hibel et al., 2010), confirms that body of research,
as Black, Latinx, and Asian students have lower odds of special education
receipt than their White peers, once the confounders are taken into account.
In the full model presented in Table 3 and Figure 1, which includes the
interactions between student-level race and school-level proportion White, I
find that the relation between student-level race and special education varies
across schools with different racial compositions. In the interactive model,
the school-level main effect of proportion White applies only to White students; the coefficient is large and negative (21.089, p \ .001), indicating
that the risk of special education receipt is greater for White students in
schools with fewer White peers. The coefficients for the interactions
between race and school composition are all large, positive, and significant,
negating the main effects of both individual-level race and school proportion

White for these non-White populations. As can be seen intuitively in Figure
1, this means that school racial composition only matters for White students’
odds of receipt of special education, as they experience a higher probability
of special education receipt in schools with fewer White peers and decreasing probability as the school composition becomes more White. In contrast,
all non-White students experience essentially no change in odds across
schools with different racial compositions.
Higher-Status Disabilities
The higher status categories of disabilities include other health impairment (most frequently ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, and speech/language impairment. The preliminary models for these disability categories
(Model 1 of Supplemental Tables 2, 3, and 4) generally follow the previous
research findings that they are meant to replicate. When only race and gender are included, compared with White students’ odds of special education
receipt, Black and Native American students generally have higher odds of
special education receipt, while Latinx students have similar odds for most
higher-status categories, and Asian students have lower odds. Notably, for
autism spectrum disorder (Supplemental Table 3), White students have
higher odds than all other students, even in these simple models. When
a richer set of covariates is included (Model 2 of Supplemental Tables 2, 3,
16

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education

and 4), the findings here largely replicate the body of research that uses
a similar set of variables, finding that White students’ odds of special education receipt is higher than that of all their peers, excepting Asian and Native
American students for the autism and speech/language outcomes.
The full models presented in Table 3 and Figures 2, 3, and 4, which
include the cross-level interaction between school racial composition and
student race, however, demonstrate that White students’ higher odds of special education receipt for these categories is only in schools with fewer
White students. This can be seen in the negative, significant coefficients
for the main effects of race for the higher-status disabilities in Table 3. The
coefficients for the main effect of school-level proportion White (which, in
the fully interactive model, apply to the White students as the reference category) are negative and significant, indicating reduced odds of special education receipt for White students as the school proportion White increases.
Meanwhile, the large, positive, significant interactions between student-level
race and school-level racial composition indicate that Asian, Black, Latinx,
and Native American students do not experience similar variation with
school proportion White. The predicted probabilities (Figures 2, 3, and 4)
illustrate these findings more intuitively: White students’ increased probability of special education receipt for higher-status disabilities is only in schools
with fewer White students and decreases as the proportion White increases.

17

Figure 3. Predicted probability of autism spectrum disorder.

For Asian, Black, Latinx, and Native American students, there is essentially
no change in their low probability of special education receipt for these categories of disability.
Lower-Status Disabilities
The two lower-status disabilities are emotional disturbance and intellectual disability. Again, for these outcomes, the two preliminary models generally follow the findings of the research that they are meant to replicate.
Preliminary Model 1, found in each of the Supplemental Tables 5 and 6
for these outcomes, investigates only the effects of student-level race and
gender on risk of special education receipt. These simple models show
higher odds of emotional disturbance for Black and Native American students relative to their White peers, and they show higher odds of intellectual
disability for Black, Latinx, and Native American students than for White students. Asian students, again, have lower odds of these lower-status disabilities than their White peers. Preliminary Model 2, found in Supplemental
Tables 5 and 6 for these outcomes, seeks to replicate research using a richer
set of school- and student-level covariates. Similar to that research, these preliminary models find that non-White students are not at higher risk of special
education receipt than their White peers for these outcomes, excepting
Native American students’ risk of emotional disturbance.
18

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education

Figure 4. Predicted probability of speech/language impairment.

Table 3 and Figures 5 and 6 present the findings for the full models for
lower-status disabilities: emotional disturbance and intellectual disability.
Recall that for the higher-status disability categories, White students experience higher risk of special education receipt in schools with the fewest
White peers, and their risk declines as the school composition becomes
more White; meanwhile, for students of color, risk of special education receipt
is lower and not correlated with school racial composition for the higherstatus disabilities. In contrast, the results for the lower-status disability categories of emotional disturbance and intellectual disability indicate that White
students experience no change in risk of special education receipt and that
students of color experience increasing risk of receipt as the school proportion
White increases. Specifically, the main effects of race for Asian, Black, Latinx,
and Native American students demonstrate lower risk of special education
receipt in schools with the fewest White students for intellectual disability;
the results for emotional disturbance are the same excepting Native
American students. The main effects for school-level proportion White indicate that White students experience no change in risk of lower-status disability
categories as the school racial composition changes. The coefficients for the
interactions suggest that as the school proportion White increases, children
of color experience substantively large, significantly increased risk of special
education receipt (excepting Native American students for the outcome of

19

Fish

emotional disturbance and Asian students for the outcome of intellectual disability). Figures 5 and 6 illustrate these patterns more intuitively, showing that
for the lower-status disability outcomes, Black and Latinx students—and less
consistently Asian and Native American students—experience lower probability of special education receipt relative to their White peers only in schools
with predominantly students of color, and their probability of receipt increases
as the school composition becomes more White.
Stratified-Status Disability
For specific learning disability, the preliminary models again replicate
the findings of the previous research: the model including only gender
and race (Supplemental Table 7, Model 1) demonstrates higher odds of special education receipt for non-White students; the model including the richer
set of covariates (Supplemental Table 7, Model 2) demonstrates lower odds
for Asian, Black, and Latinx students than their White peers. The full model,
which tests the interaction between school racial composition and student
race, can be found in Table 3 and in Figure 7. The findings for this model
are consistent with the outcomes for higher-status disabilities for White students and consistent with the lower-status disabilities for students of color.
The negative main effects of race and the negative main effect of proportion
White indicate that White students experience higher risk of special
20

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education

Figure 6. Predicted probability of intellectual disability.

education receipt in schools with the fewest White students and that this risk
decreases as the school composition becomes less White. In contrast, the
large, significant interaction effects for students of color not only offsets
the main effects of race and racial composition; in fact, the direction of
school composition effects reverses for students of color. The more intuitive
predicted probabilities shown in Figure 7 illustrate that White students experience a similar pattern for specific learning disability as they do for higherstatus disabilities: decreasing risk as the school composition becomes more
White; meanwhile, students of color experience a similar pattern for specific
learning disability as they do for lower-status disabilities: increasing risk as
the school composition becomes more White.
Covariates
The student- and school-level covariates included in Model 2 (in the
supplemental tables) and in Model 3 (in the supplemental tables and in
Table 3) also provide new data on the individual and contextual factors
that are associated with receipt of special education. Across the models,
ELL status is associated with lower risk of special education receipt, while
qualifying for FRL is associated with higher risk of special education receipt
for all categories excepting autism, which is negatively associated with FRL.
While grade level and attendance are statistically significant, the effect sizes
21

Fish

are substantively meaningless. The estimates for student transfer status are
negative except for emotional disturbance. Attending a school with a higher
proportion of ELLs reduces risk of special education receipt only for higherstatus disabilities, while attending a school with more students qualifying for
FRL increases risk for the lower- and stratified-status disability categories and
for other health impairment. The proportion of recently transferred students
is unrelated to special education receipt for most disabilities, but it is positively associated with risk of emotional disturbance and negatively associated with risk of intellectual disability. School-level academic achievement
is associated with increased odds of a student receiving special education
for every category excepting intellectual disability. The proportion of teachers of color is generally associated with increased odds of special education
receipt. Teacher credentials and bilingualism are unassociated with student
risk of special education, excepting the proportion of teachers with master’s
degrees being negatively associated with student risk of emotional disturbance and positively associated with risk of speech/language impairment.

Discussion
The results presented here suggest that categories of educational disability are constructed in ways that intersect with race, and that schools sort
22

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
students into special education services in ways that may reinforce racial
inequalities. Specifically, racial distinctiveness, or being surrounded by
fewer same-race peers, appears to drive the salience of race in sorting into
special education. While White students’ risk of lower-status disabilities
was unaffected by school racial composition, Black, Latinx, and, less consistently, Native American students experience increased risk of these disabilities when they are racially distinct within a school. In a near-mirror
image, while non-White students experience little-to-no change in risk of
higher-status disabilities in schools with different racial compositions,
White students experience increased risk of these disabilities when they
are racially distinct within a school. For specific learning disability—the
stratified-status category—the moderation by school racial composition mirrors the higher-status categories for White students and the lower-status categories for students of color.
In sum, in the context of racial distinctiveness, White students who are
struggling in school appear to maintain some relative advantages: Rather
than being seen as simply low performing or unmotivated, they are more
likely than their peers to be sorted into higher-status disabilities. These
higher-status disabilities tend to provide greater teacher resources, accommodations that facilitate access to the general education curriculum, and
a destigmatizing explanation for low performance. Meanwhile, in the context of racial distinctiveness, Black, Latinx, and, less consistently, Native
American students who are struggling in school are sorted into lower-status
disabilities, excluding them from the general education classroom, segregating them with other lower-performing peers, and allocating a stigmatizing
label. While none of these disability categories are likely purely advantageous or disadvantageous, and the teachers and service providers working
with these students undoubtedly aim to support students’ success, the variation in status of disability can facilitate within-school stratification. The relation between race and disability demonstrated here suggests that categorical
inequality processes (Domina et al., 2017) do not merely sort students into
special and general education but that they sort students into different categories of disability, both creating and reinforcing racialized categories of disability and reinforcing racial inequality.
Moreover, the two preliminary models replicated the findings of both (a)
the large body of disproportionality research that reports disparities in incidence by race and (b) the newer research that includes a richer set of covariates and multilevel modeling. This suggests that the findings here are not
merely an artifact of this particular data set, at least in terms of the main individual- and school-level effects. It is only when the interactions between
school-level racial composition and student-level race are included that
the more complicated relationship between race and special education is
revealed. In the interest of contributing to the knowledge of student- and
school-level predictors of special education receipt, it is also worth briefly
23

Fish
interpreting the estimates for covariates that are not the focus of this study,
many of which have been included in previous disproportionality research.
The finding that ELL status is associated with lower risk of special education
receipt is consistent with previous research (Morgan et al., 2015), perhaps
because when these students struggle, teachers perceive the difficulty as
attributable to learning a new language. Qualifying for FRL is associated
with a higher risk of special education receipt for all categories excepting
autism, which is negatively associated with FRL. Consistent with previous
findings (Morgan et al., 2016), it suggests, unsurprisingly, that lower socioeconomic status is associated with increased schooling challenges that might
result in special education receipt. The inverse relationship for autism, then,
provides some support for this category being conceptualized as a higherstatus disability. The largely negative estimates for student transfer status
likely reflect the challenges of testing and identifying disabilities among
a more mobile population.
The school-level predictors, too, contribute to the body of knowledge
around special education receipt. The findings presented here, in which
higher school-level academic achievement is associated with higher risk of
all disabilities except for intellectual disability, is largely consistent with
the findings by Hibel et al. (2010) and likely due to the increased risk of
identifying children as struggling when they stand out among higherperforming peers. The finding of a positive relationship between the risk
of special education receipt and the school-level proportion of teachers of
color is expanded upon by Fish (2019) and may be due to teachers of color
perceiving their students more positively (Bates & Glick, 2013; Irizarry, 2015;
Pigott & Cowen, 2000), seeing higher potential and thus greater need for
services among struggling students. Other school-level predictors are less
consistent with existing literature, such as the positive association between
school proportion FRL and risk of lower- and stratified-status categories of
disability. This may reflect the lower level of resources available at these
schools, meaning that fewer intervention options are available outside of
special education and also that these less-advantaged schools might be
more likely to sort students into lower-status categories of disability.
Possible Mechanisms
While findings suggest that racial distinctiveness within a school enhances the role of race in sorting into disability categories, the mechanisms of
this process cannot be addressed by the data and methods used here.
Existing research suggests several possible ways that school racial composition shapes racial inequalities in special education; however, some of these
potential mechanisms are better supported by the findings than others.

24

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
Teachers’ Perceptions of Students
Special education placement reflects, in part, a referral by a teacher who
perceives the students as struggling in comparison with (a) their expectations of the student and (b) their peers’ performance (Gerber & Semmel,
1984; Mamlin & Harris, 1998). The teacher’s suspicion of disability is thus
informed by comparisons with peers. Indeed, Hibel et al. (2010) find that
students have a higher risk of special education receipt when they attend
schools with higher-achieving peers and more White peers, which they suggest makes low-performing students stand out more, known as frog pond
effects (Davis, 1966). Yet it is also possible that teacher evaluations of student
skills may be based on ‘‘demographic statuses linked to achievement [that
act as] the trigger for the comparison processes’’ (Crosnoe, 2009). In this
way, the racial biases that unintentionally affect teachers’ suspicions of
exceptionality (Fish, 2017) may become more salient when a student stands
out racially among his peers. Thus, racial distinctiveness might enhance
racial bias in teachers’ perceptions of students, exacerbating biased perceptions of students of color as having lower-status disabilities, such as emotional disturbance (Fish, 2017), as well as biased perceptions of White
students’ academic challenges as reflecting higher-status disabilities, such
as ADHD (Fish, 2017). Indeed, the findings here suggest that school racial
composition might matter for racialized sorting into disability through such
racialized frog pond effects.
It is also possible that teacher racial bias varies across schools of differing racial compositions because of staff selection into these schools. For
instance, a teacher or other school staff member that has more negative perceptions of students of color would likely choose to work in a school with
fewer students of color. Such a teacher may not adequately support children
of color to prevent disability identification and also may advocate for services under lower-status disability categories that are more exclusionary.
Similarly, a teacher who chooses to teach in a school with more students
of color may be more likely to perceive these students more favorably or
may have a political ideology rooted in racial equity. As a result, such
a teacher may be less likely to advocate for lower-status categories of disability for students of color or may seek to reduce the placement of children of
color in special education more broadly.
Racial Political Climate
Second, as is suggested by both empirical findings (Eitle, 2002) and theory (Ferri & Connor, 2005; Mccall & Skrtic, 2009), racial composition may
matter for sorting into special education by creating racial political climates
that facilitate racialized sorting (Eitle, 2002; Ferri & Connor, 2005; Hibel et al.,
2010; Mccall & Skrtic, 2009). Schools with more students of color may be less
likely to place students in special education because of policy- and parent25

Fish
led pressure to reduce overrepresentation of students of color in special education, as higher numbers of families of color may support effective mobilization against placement (Eitle, 2002; Hibel et al., 2010). Alternatively, racial
composition may engender racialized competition over scarce educational
resources, as White families may perceive students of color as a threat to
their own children’s success (Blalock, 1967; Blumer, 1958; Bobo, 1983),
for instance, taking the teachers’ attention away from their own children.
While teachers and other staff members in eligibility meetings base diagnoses on assessment tools, these parental pressures may affect their interpretations of assessments (Lipsky, 1971). Research on other categorical inequality
processes supports this mechanism, as findings suggest that advantaged families advocate for academic tracking in schools with more racial and socioeconomic diversity (Domina, Hanselman, Hwang, & McEachin, 2016;
Staiger, 2004; Wells & Serna, 1996). Thus, in the context of racial distinctiveness of children of color, White parents may pressure school staff to reduce
the perceived impact of children of color on the classroom (e.g., by complaining that particular students are taking too much of the teacher’s
time), facilitating placement into special education for more exclusionary
disability categories.
When their own children are racially distinct, in contrast, White families
with low-performing children may advocate for higher-status disabilities,
which allocate more teacher resources to their children and also distinguish
and separate them from merely low-performing peers (McGrath & Kuriloff,
1999; Noguera, 2001; Wells & Serna, 1996). This explanation is particularly
compelling in the context of schools with more children of color, as resources tend to be more scarce in general in these schools, which likely explains
the overall pattern of lower levels of special education receipt in these
schools (Hibel et al., 2010). This relative scarcity may increase White families’
likelihood of advocating for higher-status disabilities, which would provide
extra teacher resources and supports within a lower-resourced environment.
Student Need for Special Education Services
Finally, school racial composition may directly affect the development of
skills and behaviors through social-psychological mechanisms, shaping student need for special education services. Some research suggests that attending a school with a high proportion of students of color harms the outcomes
of students of color (Berends, Lucas, & Penaloza, 2008; Hanushek & Rivkin,
2009; Mickelson, Bottia, & Lambert, 2013). Yet other research suggests that
attending schools with more same-race peers has positive effects for students
of color, such as more positive academic orientations and school attachment
(Goldsmith, 2004; Tyson et al., 2005), lower levels of social isolation (Tyson
et al., 2005), and protection from stereotype threat (Hanselman et al., 2014).
The findings here are partially consistent with the latter set of research, as for
26

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
students of color having more same-race peers is an asset that may work to
support lower odds of lower-status disabilities. Yet that research does not
shed light on the opposite pattern found here among White students, suggesting that other explanations are more likely for the overall findings.
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. One problem, which is shared by
many observational studies of racial disproportionality in special education
(Hibel et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2015; Shifrer et al., 2011), is that achievement data are likely partially endogenous. Children with disabilities are often
identified because they are low performers, and after placement in special
education, and even in the years preceding placement while alternative
interventions are attempted, they receive instruction that may actually further limit their academic achievement. If factors such as teacher expectations
and perceptions affect racial disparities in identification of disabilities, as is
consistent with the findings presented here, then these same mechanisms
likely affect achievement throughout schooling (Jussim, Eccles, & Madon,
1996; McKown & Weinstein, 2002; Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968). However,
academic skills also likely play a role in whether a child is identified as having a disability. This study is observational and does not speak to causality.
The decision to include the test scores in the models is imperfect, yet it is less
imperfect than excluding these data on academic achievement. Moreover,
the body of literature that examines a rich set of covariates as predictors
of special education placement includes these variables; thus, including
these variables allows for comparisons with that body of research. I also conducted a set of analyses that exclude the test scores (available on request),
which produced interaction effects in similar directions as the results presented here.
Second, the data present some limitations in terms of generalizability;
specifically, the patterns observed may be specific to the Wisconsin context.
Indeed, Wisconsin has a very high proportion of White population. While
the size of the data set alleviates concerns about the model estimates presented here, the state may have a particular political and cultural context
that shapes the findings. However, these generalizability concerns are largely
ameliorated by the findings that the preliminary models (presented in the
supplemental tables) generally parallel the findings of the nationally representative studies they are meant to replicate. Unlike the national samples
used in many studies (Hibel et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2015; Shifrer et al.,
2011), the size and completeness of the data allow for investigation of racial
disparities across all documented racial groups, including Native American
students, and all disability categories of interest. Additionally, disproportionality scholars argue that these patterns are inherently local and that state and
local analyses are critical to understanding racial disparities in special
27

Fish
education (Artiles, 2011; Donovan & Cross, 2002). This suggests the need for
replications of this research in other state contexts.
Implications
Racial Disproportionality in Special Education
In 2016, the Obama administration issued Equity in Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) regulations, which required ‘‘a common
standard for identifying significant disproportionality in representation of
students within special education,’’ as well as segregated settings and disciplinary actions; the rule also required school districts to address disproportionality due to under- or overidentification (U.S. Department of Education,
Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, & Office of Special
Education Programs, 2016). As of the time of this article being written, the
status of this provision is contested: The U.S. Education secretary Betsy
DeVos delayed the implementation of the Equity in IDEA rule
(Voulgarides, 2018), but this delay was ruled illegal (Axelrod, 2019). While
the attempted delay suggests a minimization of the civil rights issue and
an emphasis on states’ rights by the U.S. Department of Education
(Voulgarides, 2018), it appears that even the original rule, meant to increase
racial equity, had the potential to oversimplify the nature of the problem. My
findings suggest that the relation between race and special education receipt
varies by category of disability and by school context, suggesting a more
complex process—with more complex implications (Kauffman &
Anastasiou, 2019)—than the current debate of overrepresentation (e.g.,
Skiba et al., 2005) versus underrepresentation (e.g., Morgan et al., 2015) of
children of color in special education. Indeed, a determination of ‘‘overrepresentation’’ of a racial group that ignores individual- and school-level confounders may inadvertently harm children by denying them services.
While research on the effects of special education on child outcomes
presents mixed findings (Hanushek, Kain, & Rivkin, 2002; Morgan et al.,
2010; Shifrer et al., 2013), the current findings, in conjunction with the typology of disability status, suggest that policy should not simply focus on
schools’ referrals and qualifications of students of color with educational disabilities. Rather, further research should investigate the effects of these services for students, to determine the full implications of which students are
sorted into special education. Meanwhile, rather than discouraging teachers
from referring students of color to special education testing, students might
be better served by both (a) reducing inequalities that might lead to disability
identification, such as improved access to high-quality early-childhood education that would improve skills at school-entry, and (b) making special education service provision as equitable, high-quality, and inclusive as possible,
so that special education services support access and success for all students
with disabilities. While implementation of the Equity in IDEA rule would
28

Racial Composition and Sorting Into Special Education
help establish the U.S. Department of Education’s commitment to racial
equity, future policies need to properly account for the complexities of identifying disabilities and appropriately supporting students.
School Racial Context and Categorical Inequality
The results presented here have implications not only for the scholarly
understanding of racial disproportionality in special education but also for
the literature on the role of school racial composition in categorical inequality processes. The majority of the literature provides evidence that racially
integrated schools reduce racial achievement gaps and improve the achievement of students of color (Berends et al., 2008; Borman et al., 2004; Grissmer,
Flanagan, & Williamson, 1998; Guryan, 2004; Hanushek & Rivkin, 2009;
Mickelson et al., 2013). Yet I find that White students secure more withinschool advantages when they attend schools with more peers of color,
and that students of color are sorted into more disadvantaged positions
when they attend schools with more White students. Racial integration is
a presumed social good that supports racial equity. However, my findings
align with a small body of work suggesting that some processes in more
racially diverse schools may also exacerbate some racial inequalities
(Hanselman et al., 2014; Tyson, 2011). Specifically, my findings suggest
that racial distinctiveness may exacerbate categorical inequality and that
attending a school with more same-race peers may provide some benefits
for children of color. Given the advantages of integrated schools for racial
equity more broadly (Berends et al., 2008; Borman et al., 2004; Grissmer
et al., 1998; Guryan, 2004; Hanushek & Rivkin, 2009; Mickelson et al.,
2013), this suggests a need for a better understanding of how inequality is
maintained even in more diverse schools.

Interpreting logistic regression results: For the main effects, a positive (or negative)
coefficient is exponentiated to an odds ratio greater than (or less than) 1.00, indicating an
increase (or decrease) in the odds of a student receiving special education, for each unit
increase in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other variables in the model
constant, as compared with students without that unit increase. For example, in Table 3, in
the column displaying results for Any Disability, the coefficient for the student-level variable, Black, is 21.157, which is exponentiated to an odds ratio of 0.314. Thus, holding all

29

Fish
other variables constant, Black students experience a decrease in odds of special education receipt for any disability, as compared with White students. The school-level variables
generally follow a similar interpretation. The inclusion of interactions necessitates a different interpretation for school racial composition and interaction estimates. The main effect
of Proportion White is the change in log odds of special education receipt when the school
proportion White changes from 0 to 1, for White students only; meanwhile, the interaction
effect for Proportion White by student race is the corresponding change in log odds for
each non-White racial group. For example, under the outcome of Any Disability in
Table 3, the coefficient for Proportion White means that White students experience
a decrease in log odds of special education receipt of 21.089 (exponentiated to an
odds ratio of 0.337) when they experience a change from a school with no White students
to a school with all White students. The estimate for the interaction of Black 3 Proportion
White is 1.268, meaning that with the corresponding change in school racial composition,
Black students experience a change in log odds of (21.089 1 1.268) = 0.179 (exponentiated to an odds ratio of 1.196). The exponentiated coefficient for the interaction term is the
ratio of the odds ratio for racial composition for White students over the odds ratio for
racial composition for Black students: 1.196/0.337 = 3.555.
