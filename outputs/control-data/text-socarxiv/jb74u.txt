Abstract
Objectives: Test whether cooperation with the police can be modelled as a place-based norm that varies
in strength from one neighborhood to the next. Estimate whether perceived police legitimacy predicts
an individual’s willingness to cooperate in weak-norm neighborhoods, but not in strong-norm
neighborhoods where most people are either willing or unwilling to cooperate, irrespective of their
perceptions of police legitimacy.
Methods: A survey of 1,057 individuals in 98 relatively high-crime English neighborhoods defined at
a small spatial scale measured (a) willingness to cooperate using a hypothetical crime vignette and (b)
legitimacy using indicators of normative alignment between police and citizen values. A mixed-effects,
location-scale model estimated the cluster-level mean and cluster-level variance of willingness to
cooperate as a neighborhood-level latent variable. A cross-level interaction tested whether legitimacy
predicts individual-level willingness to cooperate only in neighborhoods where the norm is weak.
Results: Willingness to cooperate clustered strongly by neighborhood. There were neighborhoods with
(i) high mean and low variance, (ii) high mean and high variance, (iii) (relatively) low mean and low
variance, and (iv) (relatively) low mean and high variance. Legitimacy was only a positive predictor of
cooperation in neighborhoods that had a (relatively) low mean and high variance. There was little
variance left to explain in neighborhoods where the norm was strong.
Conclusions: Findings support a boundary condition of procedural justice theory: namely, that
cooperation can be modelled as a place-based norm that varies in strength from neighborhood to
neighborhood and that legitimacy only predicts an individual’s willingness to cooperate in
neighborhoods where the norm is relatively weak.

Security cannot be produced by either police or citizens acting alone. Because legal authorities rely on
the public to report crimes, provide intelligence and give evidence in court, it is important to put into
place policies and practice in ways that secure active public support if the police, criminal courts and
correctional facilities are to effectively fight crime and maintain social order in communities. We build
in this paper on a popular account of police-citizen relations aimed at understanding what police officers
can do to encourage public cooperation and legal compliance: namely, procedural justice theory (PJT;
Tyler & Huo, 2002; Tyler & Fagan, 2008). In particular we use an innovative statistical tool—the
mixed-effects, location-scale model (Hedeker et al., 2008; Leckie et al., 2014; Brunton-Smith et al.,
2018)—to examine an as-yet unexplored boundary condition of PJT—i.e. that legitimacy only plays a
role when the norm to cooperate is weak in an individual’s own neighborhood.
PJT is premised on the idea that there are normative motivations to cooperate with the police
(e.g. the public belief that the police have a valid claim to power and are therefore entitled to be obeyed)
and there are instrumental motivations to cooperate (e.g. the public balancing of the risks and benefits
of proactive support) and that each is associated with a different style of policing (Sunshine & Tyler,
2003; Tyler, 2006a, 2006b; Tyler & Trinkner, 2018). On the one hand, an instrumental account of
cooperation stresses a more coercive style of policing, whereby officers encourage cooperative
behaviour by wielding their authority in ways that signal effectiveness, protection, strength and power.
On the other hand, a normative account of cooperation stresses consensual social control practices—
officers encourage proactive public support by acting in ways that signal respect, neutrality,
accountability and moral authority.
Tests in the US, UK and Australia generally find that perceived police legitimacy is a more
important predictor of cooperation than instrumental factors related to effectiveness and risk (Tyler,
2006a, 2006b, 2013; Huq et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2013a; Tyler & Jackson, 2014; Murphy et al.,
2015, 2017; Madon et al., 2016; Bolger & Walters, 2019). Work from an increasing number of countries
across the world has also addressed the factors that legitimate the police (Jackson, 2018). Overall,
evidence that procedural justice is key to the legitimation of the police, coupled with the fact that
legitimacy is generally the strongest predictor of cooperation, suggests that police need to act in
procedurally just ways if they want to generate popular legitimacy, increase public cooperation, and
thereby fight crime (President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, 2015).
There is also empirical support for the role that neighborhood context plays in people’s
willingness to cooperate with the police (Kochel, 2018a, 2018b; Berg et al., 2013; Gau, 2012; Slocum
et al., 2010; Warner, 2007; Goudriaan et al., 2006). In their assessment of contextual factors that are
separate to what the police do or do not directly do, many of these studies have tested whether structural
and/or social neighborhood characteristics help explain the clustering of levels of public cooperation
from one locality to the next. For example, Jackson et al. (2013a) found (a) that public willingness to
cooperate with the police in London was clustered by neighborhood, (b) that neighborhood levels of
collective efficacy, disorder and fear of crime explained this clustering, not crime, deprivation,
residential stability and ethnicity diversity, and (c) that legitimacy played an important individual-level
role in motivating cooperation and mediating some of the statistical effects of neighborhood context on
cooperation. The argument was that public cooperation and police legitimacy are both rooted in whether
the local area seems to successfully police itself, with poor social conditions linked to beliefs among
citizens that police power is not justified, that their authority is open to question, and therefore that
cooperation with them should be avoided.
In this paper we contribute to the criminological literature on police legitimacy and public
willingness to cooperate with the police. Bringing together (a) things that police can more directly do
to encourage public cooperation and (b) factors driving perceived police legitimacy that are less related
to their activity, our focus is at the individual and at the neighbourhood level. In particular, we consider
the idea that living in a neighborhood in which there is a strong shared social norm to cooperate has an
important place-based effect on an individual’s own personal willingness to cooperate with the police.
Social norms are standards or expectations of behaviour that are based on shared beliefs that guide
and/or constrain social behaviour among members of a social group, and one reason why people may
(or may not) be willing to cooperate with the police is—we argue—that they have (or have not)
internalised the social norm that they should be willing to proactively help the police fight crime;
cooperating is what people should do and cooperating is what other people would expect them to do.
Moreover, we posit that these place-based norms operate at a small spatial scale. In neighborhoods with
a widely shared social norm, residents (i) generally believe that it is appropriate to conform to this
expectation (i.e. are willing to cooperate with the police if the need and/or opportunity arose), (ii)

3

believe that others in the neighborhood also believe this, (iii) expect others in the neighborhood to
conform (and disapprove of those who do not), which implies that (iv) an individual living in such a
neighborhood is more willing to cooperate because she believes that others expect her to also conform
and will censure her in some way if she did not cooperate.
To assess this neighborhood-level account of public willingness to cooperate with the police,
we draw on data from a survey of individuals living in neighborhoods within a large metropolitan area
of England. We define neighborhoods at an unusually small spatial scale, and we fit a mixed-effects,
location-scale model (Hedeker et al., 2008; Leckie et al., 2014; Brunton-Smith et al., 2018) to estimate
the neighborhood-level mean and variance of residents’ expressed willingness to cooperate with the
police. This analytical strategy allows us to more adequately assess the strength of spatially-varying
social norms compared to standard mixed effects models. Our approach addresses the question of
whether some localities have a strong normative consensus of cooperation with the police, other
neighborhoods exhibit a strong norm not to cooperate, and still other neighborhoods exhibit relatively
weak normative pressure.
We also assess an under-explored boundary condition in PJT: namely, that legitimacy only
plays a role when the norm to cooperate is weak in an individual’s neighborhood. A norm is strong in
a social group when most members of the group have internalized it, and in the context of place-based
norms to cooperate, this may mean that people will irrespective of their perceptions of police
legitimacy) be willing to cooperate because most people in the neighborhood believe that they would—
and should—help the police if the situation were to arise and find that others would disapprove if they
did not cooperate. Conversely, in the context of placed-based norms not to cooperate, most people in
the neighborhood (irrespective of their perceived police legitimacy) believe that they would not—and
should not—help the police if the situation were to arise and that others would disapprove if they did
cooperate. If the social norm to cooperate dominates in a locality, cooperation is taken as given; nearly
everyone is willing to cooperate, so there is no space for legitimacy to play a role. But in neighborhoods
where the norm is weak, legitimacy provides an incentive to support an institution that is considered to
be moral, just and appropriate.
From a methodological perspective, our study contributes to the criminological literature by
applying a new statistical model for estimating the social characteristics of neighborhoods. A large and
growing body of work has applied multi-level modelling to address questions about, inter alia, legal
cynicism, collective efficacy and police legitimacy within neighborhoods (Sampson et al., 1996;
Sampson & Bartusch, 1998; Kirk & Papachristos, 2011; Jackson et al., 2013a). A development of this
framework—the mixed-effects location scale model—allows us to model within-neighborhood
heterogeneity in the norm to cooperate as a function of characteristics of neighborhoods and individuals.
We also assess whether this heterogeneity in norm strength across neighborhoods can explain variability
in the relationship between police legitimacy and willingness to cooperate.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. First, we review the literature on what
motivates people to be willing to pro-actively cooperate with the police. After documenting relevant
ethnographic work that drove—and helps us illustrate—our intuition, we motivate the current
theoretical expectation: namely, that cooperation is a placed-based norm that is stronger in some
neighborhoods than others, and that residents of strong norm localities will be willing to cooperate,
independently of their perception of police legitimacy. Second, we present the analytical strategy. We
motivate why we use an innovative sampling design (detailed below) and why we fit a novel statistical
model (the mixed effects location-scale model) to estimate the cluster-level mean and variance. Third,
we outline our data and methods. Fourth, we present the results. The final section considers the
implications of our findings, how they might be taken forward in later work, and what the mixed-effects
location-scale model adds to the methodological toolbox for criminologists interested in modelling
social characteristics of neighborhood.
Why do people cooperate with the police?
It is vital to have robust evidence on what legal authorities can do to encourage public support; the
police rely on the public working with them to effectively manage crime. Thus far, there is a good deal
of empirical support for key predictions of procedural justice theory, particularly the role that perceived
police legitimacy plays in explaining variation in people’s willingness to cooperate with the police
(President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. 2015). For example, Sunshine & Tyler (2003) found
that New York City residents who viewed the police as legitimate also tended to report a willingness to
cooperate. Tyler & Fagan’s (2008) longitudinal study found something similar. In both cases, the

4

instrumental motivations against which legitimacy was compared were public assessments of police
performance in fighting crime and perceived risk of being caught for low-level criminal behavior. In
related work, White et al. (2016) found that individuals (who had been arrested for a variety of different
crimes in Arizona) who felt a normatively grounded sense of support for—and deference toward—the
police also tended to report being willing to report a crime to the police. This was true for each offender
type, e.g., violent, property, or drug crime. In Mazerolle et al.’s (2013) randomized controlled trial of
process-based policing in Queensland, Australia, legitimacy (similarly measured) was found to be a
strong predictor of willingness to cooperate with the police. Bolger & Walters (2019) carried out a metaanalysis of the effect of beliefs about the legitimacy of the police on people’s willingness to cooperate,
finding an average positive effect and evidence of heterogeneity in the strength of the relationship
between police legitimacy and willingness to cooperate.
At the conceptual level, Tyler (2006: 375) defines legitimacy as: ‘… a psychological property
of an authority, institution, or social arrangement that leads those connected to it to believe that it is
appropriate, proper, and just. Because of legitimacy, people feel that they ought to defer to decisions
and rules, following them voluntarily out of obligation rather than out of fear of punishment or
anticipation of reward.’ At the operational level, researchers have measured legitimacy in a variety of
different ways (for discussion, see Reisig et al., 2007; Hawdon, 2008; Bottoms & Tankebe, 2012; Tyler
& Jackson, 2013; Jackson & Gau, 2015; Hamm et al., 2017; Jackson, 2018; Jackson & Bradford, 2019;
Trinkner, 2019; Posch et al., forthcoming). One approach has been to use a single indicator of trust or
confidence in the police as a proxy for legitimacy (e.g. Boateng, 2017). A second approach has been to
treat legitimacy as unidimensional using a scale of obligation to obey, a scale of institutional trust, or
by combining obligation to obey and institutional trust (e.g. Mazerolle et al., 2013). A third approach
has been to measure legitimacy along two dimensions: judgements of appropriateness and entitlement,
with studies differentiating between either (i) obligation to obey and institutional trust (e.g. Reisig et al.
2007) or (ii) obligation to obey and normative alignment (e.g. Huq et al. 2017). This approach is
premised on defining legitimacy along two connected lines: (a) normative justifiability of power in the
eyes of citizens (the right to power) and (b) recognition of rightful authority (the authority to govern).
On the one hand, there is the judgment that an institution has a valid claim to power because it operates
in normatively appropriate ways (in the case of the police, that officers wield their authority in ways
that align with people’s sense of right and wrong, see Bradford et al., 2014a, 2014b). On the other hand,
there is the belief that the police have the right to enforce law and expect deference and compliance
(Tyler, 2006a, 2006b).
Importantly for the current study, when researchers have operationalised legitimacy as
institutional trust and obligation to obey (and modelled them as two separate explanatory variables),
they have found that institutional trust is a more important predictor of willingness to cooperate than
obligation to obey (e.g., Dirikx & van Den Bulck 2013, Reisig et al. 2007). Equally, when studies have
defined legitimacy as normative alignment and obligation to obey, normative alignment explains more
variation than obligation to obey (e.g., Jackson et al. 2013a). Because of this, we focus in the current
study on normative alignment as a predictor of willingness to cooperate (we return to the issue in the
limitations section at the end of the paper). Because of limited space in the survey, and because of prior
evidence that it is less important than normative alignment when predicting cooperation (Tyler &
Jackson, 2014; Bradford et al., 2014c; Hamm et al., 2017), we did not measure obligation to obey. We
provide a more complete rationale in the method section for the use of indicators of normative alignment
to measure the perceived police appropriateness part of the legitimacy concept.
Neighborhoods with the norm (not) to cooperate: Evidence from ethnographic studies
While studies have found significant variation across neighborhoods in willingness to cooperate with
police, no quantitative study has addressed the possibility that some of this variation arises from placebased social norms. This is surprising, in part because ethnographic studies have shown considerable
variability between communities in norms of cooperation with authorities (for a review, see Martin,
2018). For instance, Stoutland (2001) conducted in-depth interviews with community members in four
high-violence neighborhoods in Boston, all of which had been affected by a rise in youth violence. All
four neighborhoods were generally anti-police and all four had recently experienced deterrence-based
policy interventions, which meant that more officers were suddenly seen on the streets. Crucially for
the current discussion, there was a strong norm not to cooperate with the police in one of the
neighborhoods, with some community members convinced that “the police shared so few of their
priorities that they were unwilling to cooperate with them” (p. 241). The prevailing mood was to avoid

5

contact with officers. For instance, during a meeting between local agencies to discuss collaborating
with police on neighborhood crime issues, some organizations declined to participate in any program
because “they believed they would betray their constituents by working with the police” (p. 242). This
may have been because most people in this community viewed the police as illegitimate and should not,
therefore, be cooperated with. But it may also have been because there was a normative pressure not to
cooperate, arising from a belief that if they did cooperate with the police, other community members
would disapprove.
A similar example of residents feeling a sense of duty not to cooperate with the police is
described by Ilan (2018). Based on a multilevel ethnography in a disadvantaged neighborhood of innercity Dublin, Ireland, the author describes a cluster of community residents who were deeply embedded
in street culture and who held hostile attitudes towards the police. A general perception of police
illegitimacy was partly due to a sense of a collective memory—aside from individual negative
experiences with officers, the notion of mistreatment was viewed as part of a wider pattern that included
past stories circulating within the community. According to one resident, the police “stich people up,
they plant drugs on you if they don’t like you; they’re all the same, they’re all dirty bastards” (Illan,
2018, p. 689).
While these neighborhoods appear to have a strong norm not to cooperate with the police, a
different Boston neighborhood described by Stoutland (2001) exhibited a weak norm, with generally
critical views of the police, but with no overall consensus for other types of relationships. According to
a young woman in this neighborhood, “police must remember they are often strangers with a badge and
uniform in someone else’s neighborhood” (p. 246), which signaled that officers were not seen as part
of the community. However, Stoutland notes that citizens did report some good experiences: “…some
residents also told me about their experiences in which particular officers had been consistently
respectful and how this behavior influenced their feelings of security and views on Boston police” (p.
247). Residents were satisfied with this kind of increased police power when they were treated
courteously, as they perceived it to be a sign of respect. The contrasting communities described by
Stoutland demonstrates that there can be significant variability and room for alternative views even
when the dominant norm is of negativity toward the police.
Another qualitative study that describes neighborhoods in which public willingness to
cooperate with the police is in flux is that reported by Carr, Napolitano, and Keating (2007). Working
in three high-crime neighborhoods in Philadelphia—one predominantly African-American, one
predominantly Latino, and one predominantly white—the authors conducted in-depth interviews with
delinquent and non-delinquent young men and women. All three neighborhoods had a homicide rate of
at least 60 per 100,000 habitants (one of them reaching 150/100,000) and most residents lived in
poverty. Overall attitudes towards the police were critical and most youngsters were not willing to
cooperate with legal authorities. However, Carr et al. (2007) reported that about one third of residents
in each of the three neighborhoods did not have a negative disposition toward the police, indicating
some variability despite general hostility. Because residents of such communities did not hold uniformly
critical views of the police, we could say that such neighborhoods do not have an established norm
concerning cooperation with the police, with different residents holding different views on the
desirability, or imperative, of doing so. In such a context, appropriate police behavior (however
surprising it may be to residents who tended not expect fair treatment from the police) tended to be
positively perceived and might have played a role in increasing public confidence. For instance, the
authors describe the views of a 17-year-old female who used to hold critical opinions about the police
but recalls the kindness and concern shown to her by officers after events involving domestic violence
(Carr el al., 2007, p. 460). Interestingly, despite the general negative disposition toward legal authorities
in these neighborhoods, a common narrative among residents was that crime reduction would require
the commitment of more police resources—i.e., most community members saw a crucial role for police
and law enforcements in efforts to control crime.
While these studies did not directly measure a norm to cooperate with the police, they described
neighborhoods where most residents believe they should not cooperate with legal authorities (see also
Anderson, 1990, 1999). This supports the idea that there is a shared social norm not to cooperate that is
place-based. They also allude to neighborhoods where the norm to cooperate is not strong, i.e. where
there was variability in residents’ attitudes towards the police. Within this type of neighborhood, there
should be space for procedural justice, trust and legitimacy to have some influence.
Theory: Towards a placed-based social norms explanation

6

We posit a neighborhood-level explanation of people’s willingness to cooperate with the police that is
based on social norms operating at a small spatial scale. Individuals internalise norms over time and
within particular social contexts, and the legal socialization literature addresses how adolescents come
to understand their relationship with the legal system and their rights, responsibilities and obligations
with respect to the police and law. Tyler & Trinkner (2018: 4) document three processes at the heart of
legal socialization:
(1) “the internalization of values about how legal authorities are supposed to act towards citizens
and how people are supposed to behave towards authorities in their role as citizens;
(2) the formation of attitudes about the tangible representations of the law, including courts, laws,
police, judges, and other legal authorities; and,
(3) the development of the cognitive and biological capacity to reason and think about the
appropriate role for the law as a social institution in society.”
As individuals move through adolescence into adulthood, they may or may not have internalised the
norm that cooperating with the police is the right and expected thing to do. Crucially for the current
study, we propose that the neighborhood they live in as adults may then exert an important additional
effect on their willingness to cooperate. If, for instance, they live in a neighborhood where people are
pro-police and would call them if they witnessed a crime, then this may strengthen their willingness to
act accordingly due to local normative pressures.
Our analysis is foreshadowed to some degree by a study in Japan. Tsushima & Hamai (2015)
used data from a nationally representative survey that measured people’s willingness to report a crime
to the police, provide information about the culprit, and give evidence in court. They found little
variation in people’s willingness to cooperate, in that most people would do so: the mean on a composite
index was 3.4 on a scale from 1 to 4 and the standard deviation was 0.6. Legitimacy was not a significant
predictor of cooperation and, although the authors did not discuss it, it is plausible that the norm to
cooperate is generally quite strong in the general Japanese population. That is to say, most people in
Japan are willing to cooperate with police because it is a shared standard and expectation of appropriate
behaviour, so there is little variation left over for legitimacy to explain.
In a related study, Antrobus et al. (2015) found, with a sample of Australians, that an
individual’s beliefs about the extent to which neighborhood residents accepted police legitimacy was
associated with their sense of duty to obey officers. Moreover, perception of police procedural justice
was a less important predictor of duty to obey when endorsement was strong. On this basis, the authors
concluded that “those who feel there are strong community norms around police legitimacy may view
police as legitimate regardless of how they are treated [by police]. For those who live in communities
with weaker norms about police legitimacy, being treated fairly by police has a greater opportunity to
shape and change their own views” (Antrobus et al. 2015: 15).
We hypothesize that a similar relationship exists between legitimacy and cooperation. Why
might legitimacy be related to willingness to cooperate only when the norm to cooperate is weak? First,
living in a neighborhood with a strong norm tp cooperate with police is likely to lead to internalisation
of that social norm, and we propose that this more proximate group-level force over-rides the effect of
individual perceptions of police legitimacy, i.e. most people will be willing to cooperate precisely
because it is the right and expected thing to do, irrespective of what they think about the legitimacy of
the police. Second, when the norm is weak, there is space for legitimacy to play a more important role.
To understand why legitimacy motivates proactive helping behaviour, we draw on the notion of
normative alignment. People judge the right to power of an institution on the basis that the institution
acts in appropriate and justifiable ways (Tyler & Jackson, 2014; Trinkner et al. 2018), and when police
officers are seen to act according to the societal norms that proscribe how authority figures should
behave, citizens confer to the institution a sense of normativity (a property that leads people to believe
that the institution is moral, just and appropriate) that in turn activates a sense of reciprocity—if
authorities act appropriately, then citizens should also act appropriately (e.g., report crimes to the
police), because they see this as part of being a law-abiding citizen (Jackson et al. 2012, 2013a).
However, in a neighborhood with a strong norm to cooperate, everybody is willing (because of the
strength of social norms in general), so there is supplementary role for legitimacy to play.
Analytical strategy

7

Our goal is to assess whether the strength of the norm to cooperate varies across neighborhoods and
examine whether a positive role of perceived police legitimacy is limited to neighborhoods where the
norm to cooperate is weak. We develop and extend the work of Brunton-Smith et al. (2018), who used
a mixed-effects location-scale model to account for the extent to which community member are seen to
share values and be willing and able to act on behalf of the collective achieve to achieve social goods.
Estimating the central tendency and variance of cluster-level collective efficacy in neighborhoods
across London, they found a stronger negative effect of mean levels of collective efficacy on worry
about violent victimization when there was high consensus (i.e. low variance) in those neighborhoods.
We apply the same analytical strategy to people’s willingness to cooperate with the police. Our
approach comprises five sequential stages. First, we sample a total of 1,057 individuals living in 98
small-scale geographical locations (that we call ‘hexagons’ given their spatial patterning, for more
details see the method section) that we treat as neighborhoods. Second, we measure people’s expressed
willingness to cooperate with the police using a vignette (witnessing a crime in which somebody was
knocked to the floor and a wallet was stolen, and asking whether the respondent would call the police,
identify the person(s) involved, and be willing to give evidence against them in court). This is the
expressed belief that proactively helping the police and criminal courts is the right thing to do, i.e. things
that they are prepared to if the need arose. Third, we model the cluster-level mean and variance of
willingness to cooperate within each neighborhood using a mixed-effects location-scale model. Fourth,
we define neighborhoods as having a strong norm to cooperate when the mean is high and the variance
is low, i.e. where most people report that they would proactively cooperate with the police. Conversely,
if the mean is low and the variance is low, the norm not to cooperate is strong, as most people report
that they would not cooperate. Finally, we test whether legitimacy only plays a role in the
neighborhoods that are in between these poles, specifically in neighborhoods where the variance is high,
i.e. where normative pressure seems to be low because there is no strong agreement among residents
that cooperate is, or is not, the right thing to do.
Why do we infer that a norm to cooperate is present in neighborhoods where the mean is high
and the variance is low, and that a norm not to cooperate is present in neighborhoods where the mean
is low and the variance is low? Social norms are shared standards or expectations about appropriate
behaviour within a given social group, which could be a family, a friendship group, an institution, a
region, a nation and so on. It is not necessary for all individuals to internalise the norm, but within a
particular social group (e.g., within a particular neighborhood), most group members need to express
an intention to voluntarily cooperate for the norm to be strong; the idea of relative consensus is central
to the notion of a norm. If most people in a strong norm neighborhood are willing to cooperate, we infer
that most people in that locality tend to believe that it is right and proper to conform to this expectation,
and most people tend to believe that most other people in that locality also believe the same thing and
disapprove of those who do not. In such a context, we suggest, there is a shared normative ‘force’ that
provides a motivation to cooperate with the police that is place-based. This creates a more proximate
individual-level motivation to cooperate with the police compared to perceived police legitimacy,
because individuals have internalized the norm to cooperate, they believe that is the right thing to do
and that others in their neighborhood will disapprove if they did not cooperate. We use expressed
willingness to cooperate as a way of measuring this at the individual-level. If the norm to cooperate
with the police is strong in a particular neighborhood—i.e. if most people report being willing to
cooperate—then we infer that it is a shared expectation and requirement that people within that
neighborhood will cooperate with the police, not because of any existing law or rule, but because it is
generally accepted that this is what people should do. And crucially, most people need to report being
willing to cooperate if the social norm is estimated to be strong in that locality.
Data
The data used in this paper were collected on behalf of a large metropolitan police force by the survey
company Opinion Research Services in the summer of 2018. The survey used a highly clustered
sampling frame, in which all the primary sampling units—which we use to denote neighborhoods—
were selected in high crime locations (defined as being in the top 10% of areas force-wide). By
implication, the inferences and conclusions we draw based on these data are limited to high crime areas,
and may not generalise to the general population.
Neighborhoods play a central role in developing and maintaining social ties and strengthening
community cohesion. Much research has found that shared places such as parks, high streets, cafés or

8

community centres act as social conduits creating an opportunity for interaction among neighborhood
residents (Williams and Hipp, 2018; Wo, 2016). Ultimately, these social interactions engender an
augmented sense of community, resulting in enhanced community cohesion. In turn, this increased
cohesion imposes a form of informal social control on citizens and curbs (perceived and actual) crime
and disorder in the neighborhood (Brunton-Smith et al., 2014; Papachristos et al., 2011; Sampson,
2012).
The well-known analytical challenge of the concept of the neighborhood is that neighborhoods
as colloquially understood lack well-defined boundaries, making it difficult to define ecologically
persuasive units. One of the major—but often unavoidable—weaknesses of neighborhood studies is
their reliance on administrative boundaries which do not map well on to the communities they seek to
represent. This can lead to artificial positive or null-findings due to the mismatch in the aggregation of
the social context of interest (Hipp, 2007; Hipp et al., 2012). Focusing on real communities is important,
as the increased number of interactions among residents is a key element of enhancing community
cohesion and informal social control in the area (Williams and Hipp, 2018; Wo, 2016), which, in turn,
lead to increased cooperation.
In our study, we rely on smaller geographical areas called ‘hexagons’, which were created by
the large Metropolitan Police Force to be walkable and easily monitored by local police officers while
being on the beat. They were also tailored so they would consider natural (e.g., river dividing
communities) and artificial (e.g., train-tracks going through a certain neighborhood) boundaries. Hipp
et al. (2014) referred to these physical dividing lines as ‘wedges’, which normally reduce social
interactions in a neighborhood and negatively impact the perception of neighborhood attachment,
perceived neighborhood cohesion, and engagement in neighboring behaviors. Similarly, Wickes et al.
(2019) derived their neighborhood fragmentation index based on the presence of ‘social wedges’
(railways, motorways, rivers), features that conceivably reduce the propensity of social interactions in
a given neighborhood. The hexagons we use only cover spatially contiguous sections of a location
without similar wedges present, so it is more likely that the residents would be able to experience routine
encounters, interact with each other or otherwise mingle on a regular basis, potentially also affecting
their behaviour and sense of community.
These hexagons are also different from census Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA, commonly
used in UK studies) as they cover geographical areas of slightly different sizes, while their population
(and the number of households) might differ – as it is common with real communities. By contrast,
LSOAs are less concerned about the size of the geographical area instead, they try to achieve
consistency in population size. As demonstrated by several authors, geographical proximity is more
pertinent to defining neighbourhoods than population size (e.g., Williams and Hipp, 2018; Hipp, 2012),
which again leads us to believe that hexagons have more desirable characteristics than LSOAs.
Stratified clustered random sampling strategy was used to select neighborhood residents with strata
defined by eight Neighborhood Policing Units (NPU), which were further divided into four strata each
resulting in 32 strata overall. Within 30 strata, 3 hexagons were randomly selected and in the two strata
4 hexagons were selected as primary sampling units, yielding 98 in total. In each sampled hexagon an
average of 11 face-to-face interviews were conducted giving a total of 1,057 (range 1-21, with more
than 60% of hexagons resulting in 10 or 11 interviews).1 The response rate was 32%. In all analyses a
weight is applied.
Measures
Willingness to cooperate
We assess residents’ willingness to cooperate with the police using a vignette in which a crime is
witnessed involving somebody being knocked to the floor and an item of property stolen. Participants
were asked “how likely or unlikely would you be to call the police?”, with response options ranging
from ‘not at all likely’ (1) to ‘very likely’ (4). Those reporting they would be willing to contact the
police were asked two follow up questions—“how willing or unwilling would you be to identify the
person who did it?” and “give evidence in court against the person?”—with responses ranging from
‘not at all willing’ (1) to ‘very willing’ (4). Those reporting they were not likely to call the police were
1

The sampling strategy produces a random distribution of hexagons across the area, with very little evidence of hexagons
being sampled from contiguous LSOAs. Additional analyses revealed no evidence of spatial autocorrelation with no clear
pattern to nearest neighbor correlations (see appendix A.1). We therefore do not include spatially lagged measures in our
models.

allocated scores of 1 on the second and third items to reflect the fact that calling the police in this
situation is a necessary precondition for the subsequent actions.
The three items are combined using factor analysis to form a willingness to cooperate scale
(with factor loadings of .74, .92, and .85 and a Cronbach’s alpha of .88). Note in the statistical modelling
and results section, for the sake of brevity we refer to this construct as ‘willing cooperation.’
Normative alignment
We operationalize legitimacy as normative alignment (Jackson et al., 2012, 2013a; Tyler & Jackson,
2014). Proxy measures are generally preferred because it is difficult to measure people’s perceptions of
the right to rule via direct self-report (‘do you think the police have a moral right to power’?) and
authority to govern (‘do you think the police have the right to tell you what to do?’). We measure
normative alignment using two questions: “the police have the same sense of right and wrong as me’
and “I support the way the police usually act”. The mean of these two items is calculated to form a scale
(correlation of .57) that measures the belief that the officers who embody the institution behave in
normatively appropriate ways, i.e. in ways that align with people’s values. The rationale here is that if
the institution represents values that people believe to be important, they will consent to its right to
power because they believe that authority is being exercised appropriately.
Collective efficacy
We measure collective efficacy (Sampson et al., 1997: 918) at the neighborhood level by combining
four items using factor analysis to form a uni-dimensional scale and then aggregating it to the
neighborhood level. We use the following items (factor loadings in parentheses):





People in this neighborhood can be trusted (.68)
You can see from the public space here that people take pride in their environment (.76)
Local people and authorities have control over public space here (.68)
If I sensed trouble whilst in this neighborhood, I could get help from the people who live here
(.62)

Covariates
We include age, gender and an indicator of belonging to a minority ethnic group as individual level
controls. At the neighborhood level we control for the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), with higher
scores representing less deprived neighborhoods (we return to the issue of other neighborhood level
factors in the limitations section towards the end of the paper).
Analysis
To assess the strength of the social norm to cooperate across neighborhoods, we use a mixed effects
location-scale model (Hedeker et al., 2008). Like standard mixed effects models, this allows us to
generate empirical bayes estimates of between neighborhood differences in mean levels of cooperation
and to distinguish this from differences between individuals within each neighborhood. These estimates
are ‘shrunk’ back to the global mean as a function of the group sample size, enabling more robust
inferences. By including an additional random effect in the individual-level model, we are able to
generate equivalent estimates of between neighborhood differences in the extent of withinneighborhood variation (see e.g. Browning et al., 2016; Brunton-Smith et al., 2018; Hipp et al., 2018).
We also extend the location-scale model by incorporating an individual level measurement model to
correct for measurement error in our indicators of neighborhood norms in the following way. Let
denote the observed response on item ℎ (ℎ = 1, … , ) for respondent ( = 1, … , ) in neighborhood
( = 1, … , ). The measurement model can then be written as
=
+
~ (0, )

(1)

where
denotes the true willing cooperation score for respondent and
the normally distributed
measurement error. The true score
can then be modelled using the structural model:

. The
respondent-specific random effect
captures unobserved respondent characteristics which are
predictive of willing cooperation. The random effects are assumed mutually independent, independent
of the covariates, and normally distributed. The random effect variance
captures the variability in
adjusted true scores across neighborhoods, while the respondent variance
measures the variability
in respondents’ true cooperation ratings that is unexplained by the fixed and random effects. The
respondent variance is therefore corrected for random measurement error through the measurement
model in equation 1.
To assess how neighborhoods differ in the shared norm to cooperate, we expand the structural
model by removing the restriction of constant within neighborhood variance in equation (2). The
adjusted respondent true score variance
is then modelled using a log-linear link function

scores. The variance component [ ] summarises the variability in the scale of respondents’ answers

The estimated model residuals,

to cooperate moderates the relationship between normative alignment and individual cooperation. To
do this we distinguish four categories of neighborhood: neighborhoods with: 1. a low mean and low
variance (

);
and 4. a high mean and high variance (ℎ ℎ ). Interactions between these neighborhood categories and

Willingness to cooperate,
, and normative alignment,
, are derived as uni-dimensional scales
using factor analysis. Our expectation is that neighborhoods with a high mean and low variance have a
strong norm to cooperate while neighborhoods characterised by a low mean and low variance have a
strong norm not to cooperate. Conversely, neighborhoods with a low mean and high variance, or high
mean and high variance have weaker norms to cooperate. Neighborhoods are defined as high mean or
[ ]
high variance using a threshold set at 50% – high mean if
is in the top 50% of the distribution,
[ ],

[ ]

and high variance if
is in the top 50% of the distribution, [ ] . Our results are qualitatively
robust to variation of this threshold at the 25th, 33rd, 66th or 75th percentiles of the distribution (see
appendix section A.2, tables A1-A4).2

Models estimated using the full distributions of
and
and 3-way interactions with normative alignment were also
estimated, leading to the same substantive conclusions (see Appendix A.3, tables A5-A6). However, we prefer the simplicity
of presentation of the categorical 2-way interaction models.

11

Models are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods implemented in the
Stat-JR statistics package (Charlton et al. 2013; Leckie et al. 2014). Diffuse prior distributions are
specified for all parameters, and all models are run using three MCMC chains with dispersed starting
values, each with a burn-in period of 50,000 iterations and a monitoring period of 50,000 iterations.
Visual assessments of the parameter chains and standard MCMC convergence diagnostics suggest that
these periods are sufficiently long to generate robust parameter summaries (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002).
The results we present are the means, standard deviations and 95% coverage intervals of the 150,000
monitoring iterations pooled across the three chains. These quantities are analogous to the parameter
estimates, standard errors and confidence intervals obtained in a frequentist analysis. Models assessing
whether the strength of norms to cooperate moderate the effect of normative alignment are estimated
using restricted maximum likelihood in Stata.
Results
Figure 1 displays the overall pattern of differences in willingness to cooperate across the sample of
neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are ranked by the mean score on the three cooperation measures
(medians are shown with black dots), with the middle 50% of individual scores shown by the thick grey
bars and the full range given by the capped bars. The levels of cooperation are generally high across all
neighborhoods with the mean greater than three in more than two thirds of local areas, although there
is a minority of neighborhoods with substantially lower mean cooperation scores. There is little sign in
Figure 1, however, of many neighborhoods where there is a norm not to cooperate (only 12% of
neighborhoods have a mean score below 3). This would be evident if we observed more neighborhoods
with a low mean (closer to the bottom end of the scale) and low variance. The norm to cooperate in
these neighborhoods also appears to be less consensual, with the differences between respondents
generally more marked (i.e. with higher variance) when the norm to cooperate is lower. There is also
little evidence of any substantial group of neighborhoods with a high mean and high variance.

Figure 1. Neighborhood willingness to cooperate (mean and range)

Table 1 includes estimates from the mixed-effects location scale models. Model 1 (without covariates)
shows how neighborhoods differ in the mean level of cooperation (the location equation) and the within
neighborhood variance (the scale equation). The large coefficient for the intercept in the location
equation (3.37) shows that willingness to cooperate is generally high across neighborhoods, though
there is also substantial variability in this average, with the intra-class correlation showing that
approximately 20% of the total variation is between neighborhoods (adjusting for measurement error).

We also find substantial differences in the degree of within neighborhood variation. The
coefficient for the scale intercept of -1.01 equates to a population average level-1 variance of 0.65, but

13

there is also a significant scale variance of 0.96.3 To put the magnitude of this term in context, Figure 2
plots the within neighborhood variance estimates for our all neighborhoods, alongside the population
average variance (horizontal red line). This shows that while more than half of neighborhoods exhibit
little within neighborhood variation in willing cooperation (left side of the graph), a small number of
areas exhibit quite high levels of variation. The negative covariance between the location and scale
intercepts shows that neighborhoods with a lower mean level of cooperation tend also to have a higher
variance.
Model 2 includes individual and neighborhood characteristics in the location and scale
equations. Here we see that people tend to be more willing to cooperate with the police in neighborhoods
that are high in collective efficacy, and that have lower levels of deprivation. At the individual level,
willingness to cooperate is lower for residents from a black or minority ethnic background (-.15). In the
scale equation4 we find evidence that the cooperation ratings of older people are less variable (-0.07).
However, there is no indication that differences in the levels of within-neighborhood variance are
associated with collective efficacy or deprivation, with the 95% credible intervals including 0.
Figure 2. Neighborhood-specific variance in willingness to cooperate

We next assess whether these differences in neighborhood contexts affect the relationship
between normative alignment and individual willingness to cooperate (Table 2). We use the estimated
location and scale residuals from Model 1 to identify neighborhoods with high and low mean
cooperation scores and high and low variances. These indicators are then interacted these with
individual-level normative alignment. Focusing first on differences in the average willingness to
cooperate (Model 3) we find that in a neighborhood that has a low cluster-level mean, cooperation at
the individual level is low, though there is a strong positive association between normative alignment
and individual cooperation (0.21). Conversely, in neighborhoods with a high cluster-level mean,
cooperation is high and unrelated to normative alignment (0.21–0.20=0.01). In other words, in the
absence of an existing local norm to cooperate, legitimacy plays an important role but when there is a
strong local norm to cooperate, there is no additional role for legitimacy. Consistent with our
expectations, in Model 4 cooperation is also generally lower in neighborhoods where there is less
consensus (high variance) about the norm to cooperate. We also find some support for the expectation
that the effect of normative alignment is stronger in these neighborhoods (although this is only
significant at the 10% level), with legitimacy playing a more substantial role when the norm to cooperate
is ambiguous.

3

The level-1 variance is defined as
= exp( + 0.5 [ ] )
Note that a positive coefficient in the scale equation corresponds to an increase in level-1 variation (compared to the
population average), and a negative coefficient represents a decrease in variance.

Model 5 includes the interactions between the mean and variance parameters and fitted values
for this model are displayed graphically in Figure 3. We find that only in neighborhoods classified as
having a weak norm not to cooperate is there a strong association between normative alignment and
cooperation. Indeed, when normative alignment is at its maximum, there is a suggestion that this may
have the effect of substituting for the effect of the neighborhood norm. In contrast, we find no significant
differences between residents of neighborhoods that have an unambiguous cooperation norm.
Figure 3. The effect of normative alignment on willingness to cooperate across neighborhoods

Conclusions
Norms offer socially-shared standards for appropriate and inappropriate behaviour that govern what is
acceptable and unacceptable. They help to make people in the same neighborhood accountable to each
other, to demand and expect others to act in a particular way (Brennan et al., 2013). In this paper, we
have considered the idea that to cooperate with the police is a placed-based norm and, moreover, that
social norms are the dominant account of public motivation—separate from perceptions of police
legitimacy—when the group-level norm is strong in one’s immediate neighborhood. Capitalising not
only on the data structure of our study but also on recent advances in modelling the cluster-level mean
and variance, specifically the mixed-effects location-scale model (Hedeker et al., 2008; Leckie et al.,
2014; Brunton-Smith et al., 2018), our findings suggest that the norm to cooperate exists and varies in
strength from neighborhood to neighborhood, at least in the current geographical context of high-crime
parts of a large metropolitan area of England. Interestingly, there was no locality in our data where the
mean was close to the bottom end of the scale and the variance was low. This contrasts with some USbased qualitative work that describes certain communities in large metropolitan cities in which to
cooperate with the police almost makes one a ‘pariah’.
Procedural justice theory (PJT) is a popular account of how police can encourage public
cooperation by generating consensual rather than coercive connections between power-holders and
subordinates: procedural justice generates legitimacy and legitimacy generates cooperation. However,
we also found evidence for a boundary condition of procedural justice theory. In neighborhoods where
the norm was strong, the shared social consensus seemed to dominate, operating as the proximate factor
explaining relatively widespread public cooperation with the police. Nearly everyone in the
neighborhood reported being willing to cooperate, which we infer to mean that they believed that it was
the right and proper thing to do. By contrast, legitimacy only played a role in neighborhoods in which
the norm was in flux, i.e. low cluster-level mean and high cluster-level variance (where low mean was
relative rather than absolute, so lower than high mean neighborhoods, but not close to the bottom end
of the scale of cooperation). The over-arching message is that people’s relationships with police (which
we have modelled as the extent of willing cooperation) cannot be considered in isolation from their
relationships with each other (which we have modelled as neighborhood norms). The individual level
focus dominant within most PJT research—and indeed the wider body of work on public attitudes
toward police—needs therefore to be complemented by a focus on group norms, and how placed-based

16

social norms interact with people’s attitudes towards legitimacy in generating public cooperation with
police.
This finding—that police legitimacy only ‘kicks in’ when local social norms concerning
cooperation are relatively weak—is important in itself. It suggests, for example, that legitimacy building
efforts will only see a ‘return’ of increased cooperation when they are focussed on particular
neighborhoods. Although there is a possibility that due to diversion of resources to certain areas other
(not targeted) neighborhoods might suffer, recent policing studies have found only very limited negative
side-effects during focused interventions (Groff et al., 2015; Sidebottom et al., 2017). It also indicates
some of the rarely explored limits of PJT, precisely because it suggests that some of the core pathways
proposed by this theory, in this case from legitimacy to cooperation, are less salient and perhaps even
redundant in some social contexts. But this finding, and the method used to produce it, could be built
on in a number of instructive ways.
Beyond demonstrating the value of the mixed-effects location-scale model (which we consider
in some detail in the final section) our study also contributes to community criminology by relying on
small geographical areas, the so-called hexagons. Several studies in community criminology struggle
with the operationalisation and identification of genuine communities as a meaningful unit of analysis
(Hipp, 2007; Hipp et al., 2012; Wickes et al., 2019). Due to their unique features, these hexagons are
more likely to represent real neighborhoods where people interact with each other hence making the
emergence of shared norms more likely. Future studies could benefit from analysing areas designed
along similar principles.
In addition, we extended existing work that has used a location-scale approach by incorporating
a measurement error model alongside the standard location and scale effects. This has enabled a more
robust estimate of the variability in the mean and within-cluster variance across neighborhoods.
Limitations
Because it was constrained by the wider study of which it was part, the survey used in this paper was
limited in size and content. With more space we would have measured not only people’s willingness to
cooperate using a vignette but also more direct measures of the degree to which people have internalized
the norm to cooperate. This might involve measuring the belief that others in one’s social group tend to
believe that it is right and proper to conform to this expectation, the belief that most other people in
one’s social group also believe the same thing, the expectation that others conform (and to disapprove
of those who do not), and the expectation that others expect each other to also conform. Future studies
should use more comprehensive measures of the norm to cooperate and use neighborhood-level
estimates of shared norms to predict individual willingness to cooperation, as well as include survey
measures of self-reported actual behaviour (augmented perhaps by police data on things like reporting
of crime and calls for service). This would allow researchers to avoid the charge of mild tautology in
using cluster-level mean and variance estimates of a given construct to predict within-cluster individuallevel variation in the exact same construc
The measures of collective efficacy (‘People in this neighborhood can be trusted’, ‘You can see
from the public space here that people take pride in their environment’, ‘Local people and authorities
have control over public space here’ and ‘If I sensed trouble whilst in this neighborhood, I could get
help from the people who live here’ align with how the construct has been measured in a number of UK
studies (e.g. Sutherland et al., 2013; Brunton-Smith et al., 2014), in that they capture a sense of shared
trust, shared ownership and control of public space, and willingness to intervene (informal social
control). It should be noted, however, that Brunton-Smith et al. (2014) used six measures of collective
efficacy, one of which was ‘The people who live here can be relied upon to call the police if someone
is acting suspiciously’. Our measures also depart a little bit from those of Sampson et al. (1997), who
had five measures of informal social control and five measures of social cohesion. Future studies would
benefit from using a more complete scale of collective efficacy. They would also benefit from
measuring both aspects of perceived police legitimacy, i.e. not just normative alignment but also duty
to obey (for discussion, see Trinkner, 2019; Posch et al., forthcoming).
Tests of PJT tend to compare the extent to which legitimacy, on the one hand, and instrumental
factors like perceived police effectiveness and fear of crime, on the other, predict cooperation. The
current study did not include measures of effectiveness and fear of crime for reasons of space. Because
we could only include legitimacy in our analysis, it may be that the positive partial association between

17

legitimacy and cooperation (in neighborhoods where then norm to cooperate was weak) would be
attenuated if we added effectiveness and fear of crime to the model. It is for future studies to assess this.
Researchers could also assess whether there are neighborhoods that have a strong norm not to cooperate,
like for instance in certain communities in major metropolitan cities in the US.
The concentration in this study on high crime neighborhoods within the large metropolitan
areas of England is in many ways a positive factor, in as much as these are neighborhoods where it
might be expected that legitimacy and cooperation are low, or at least in doubt. But in future
development of this work, we aim to assess the extent to which our findings generalise to the full general
population of neighborhoods and individuals. Our conclusions are also not immune from the Modifiable
Areal Unit Problem. Whilst we were able to capitalise on a spatial geography that more closely
approximates meaningful neighborhoods for residents (aligning with major natural and artificial
boundaries) and police (walkable and easily monitored), and initial exploratory analysis revealed no
clear evidence of spatial autocorrelation, like all ecological studies it is remains possible that different
conclusions would be drawn if a different spatial aggregation was used.
Whilst interviews were successfully completed with an average of 11 people within each
sampled hexagon, there were a small number of hexagons (n=3) where only one interview was
achieved. The neighbourhood-level cooperation measures—mean and variance—used in this analysis
are empirical Bayes estimates (i.e. are shrunk to the grand mean as a function of sample size) so
automatically correct for this potential problem. To assess the potential impact of hexagons with one
achieved interview on our results we re-estimated the results with the three singleton hexagons
removed, yielding almost identical results (see appendix A.4).
Because of the innovative nature of the sampling process, there are no demographic/ecological
structure variables, such as social class, residential stability, ethnic diversity, and housing structure that
can be directly mapped onto each neighborhood. This means that we do not know how the
mean/variance typology of cooperation norms relates to the demographic/ecological structure of the
neighbourhoods. Our models did include the Index of Multiple Deprivation measured at LSOA level,
although the spatial mismatch with hexagons limits its utility beyond acting as a general control for
broader structural inequalities. Future studies should address this deficit with a more robust set of
ecological measures.
Finally, the observational nature of the study means that we cannot engage in causal inference,
only descriptive inference. Future studies should try to embed an experimental protocol into a one-wave
or two-wave study, building on the one presented in this paper.
Adding to the methodological toolbox of criminologists
We conclude with some thoughts on the application of the mixed-effects location-scale model in
criminology, especially in terms of estimating the strength of place-based norms and/or cultural frames.
Modelling the mean and variance of cluster level variables represents an advance over existing studies,
where the focus has typically been on mean differences between ecological units (for exceptions see
Browning et al., 2016; Brunton-Smith et al., 2018). In the present study, the mixed-effects locationscale model allowed us to provide a more nuanced picture of the strength of social norms operating
within each local neighborhood, distinguishing those locations where the norm to cooperate is ‘in flux’
because the variance is high. Recall that it was only in neighborhoods where the norm was low and the
variance was high that legitimacy played a predictive role. We could not have estimated this without
using a technique like the mixed-effects, location scale model.
There are other potential applications for this method. In addition to collective effficacy
(Brunton-Smith et al., (2018), assessments of within-cluster variance may also be usefully leveraged in
studies of sentencing consistency, signalling the existence of another layer of important uncertainties in
sentencing outcomes between judges and courts, or in developmental studies to differentiate those
individuals experiencing more uncertain developmental pathways.
The technique might be particularly relevant to concepts like legal cynicism. Sampson &
Bartusch (1998) define legal cynicism as normlessness going hand-in-hand with the belief that the law
is not created or enacted to advance people’s own interests, but is instead a tool used by elites to maintain
power and control over them (Ewick & Sibley, 1998; Tyler & Huo, 2002; Gau, 2015; Gifford & Reisig,
2019). The standard approach of modelling legal cynicism as a neighborhood-level construct is to
estimate the cluster-level mean (Sampson & Bartusch, 1998; Kirk & Papachristos, 2011; Desmond et

18

al., 2016). For example, Sampson & Bartusch (1998) found that legal cynicism predicted tolerance of
deviance, arguing that community contexts ‘shape “cognitive landscapes” (Sampson 1997) of
appropriate standards and expectations of conduct.’
But if Sampson & Bartusch (1998) had also modelled the variance around the mean, they might
have more precisely estimated the collective social property of the neighborhood and its potential
impact on tolerance of deviance. Imagine two neighborhoods. Both have the same (relatively low)
cluster-level mean level of legal cynicism, yet the first neighborhood has a relatively low variance,
while the second neighborhood has a relatively high variance. It may be that in the first neighborhood,
legal cynicism is a stronger social property than in the second neighborhood, because there is greater
agreement—most people do not believe that the law applies to them. Legal cynicism in the first
neighborhood may thus have a stronger negative effect on tolerance of deviance than otherwise
identified. In essence, without taking into account cluster-level variance in addition to cluster-level
means, one might under-estimate what Sampson & Bartusch (1998: 781) call the ‘…situational and
contextual basis of value attenuation.’ Imagine two more neighborhoods. Both have the same (relatively
low) average level of legal cynicism. The first neighborhood has a relatively low variance around the
mean and the second neighborhood has a relatively high variance. It may well be that in the first
neighborhood, the opposite of legal cynicism is a stronger social property, compared to the second
neigborhood. Most people have internalised the idea that the law applies to them and that it should be
obeyed whatever the content. They allow the law to supersede their own judgment. Collectively, the
context may provide a stronger normative influence on residents on the rejection of violence as a means
to achieve social goals (cf. Jackson et al., 2013; Gerber & Jackson, 2017; Gerber et al., 2018).
One can also think of legal cynicism ‘…as a [cultural] frame through which individuals
interpret the functioning and usefulness of the law and its agents’ (Kirk & Papachristos, 2011: 1207).
According to Kirk & Papachristos (2011: 1191), when a person agrees with three attitude statements—
“Laws are made to be broken”, “The police are not doing a good job in preventing crime in this
neighborhood”, and “The police are not able to maintain order on the streets and sidewalks in the
neighborhood”—they are expressing a ‘cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its
enforcement, such as the police and courts, are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped
to ensure public safety.’ This cultural frame is shaped by adaptation to neighborhood structural
conditions but it is also embedded in communication and social interaction between actors in a given
locality. Kirk & Papachritos (2011: 1202-1203) argue that legal cynicism is usefully represented at the
neighborhood level as something that ‘constrains choices for resolving grievances and protecting
oneself because individuals are more likely to presume that the law is unavailable or unresponsive to
their needs. In the face of such constraints, individuals may choose to engage in their own brand of
social control because they cannot rely upon the law to assist them.’ The mixed-effects, location-scale
model could be used to more completely estimate the strength of shared cultural frames within a given
neighborhood—again, the idea is that social consensus is strong when variance is low, so if legal
cynicism thus defined has a high mean and low variance in certain neighborhoods, then we can infer
that the cultural frame is particularly strong and estimate whether potential outcomes are even more
powerful in such localities.
Final words
In short, both the method and the findings presented in this paper appear worthy of significantly more
attention in the future. Public cooperation with the police is fundamental to the functioning of the justice
system at every level, and the over-arching substantive message is that people’s relationships with
police (which we have modelled as the extent of people’s willingness to cooperate with the police)
cannot be considered in isolation from their relationships with each other, which we have modelled as
neighborhood norms. The individual-level focus that is dominant within most procedural justice theory
research, and indeed the wider body of work on public attitudes toward police, needs therefore to be
complemented by a focus on group norms and values, and how these interact with people’s beliefs and
attitudes in generating people’s willingness to cooperate and actual cooperation with police, and
techniques like the mixed-effects, location-scale model will help researchers study such phenomena.

Online Appendix: Sensitivity analyses
A.1. Sampling approach
The sampling strategy adopted by the West Midlands Police was designed to produce a random
distribution of hexagons across the west midlands area. To assess the extent of spatial
autocorrelation we identify the LSOA polygon that each hexagon is located within, and plot their
spatial distribution (figure A1, left plot). Each hexagon is connected to a separate LSOA and we
see very little evidence of hexagons being sampled from contiguous LSOA. Additional analyses
revealed no evidence of spatial autocorrelation with no clear pattern to nearest neighbor
correlations (figure A1, right plot).

A.2. Alternative thresholds for identifying high and low mean variance clusters.
Model 3-5 in the main text made use of 50% cut-point for distinguishing high/low mean and variance
areas. To assess the extent that our conclusions are driven by choice of threshold, we re-estimated all
models using thresholds of 25%, 33%, 66% and 75%. These results are included in tables A1-A4.
Although estimates change moderately when the threshold is adjusted, our substantive conclusions
remain consistent. To demonstrate the consistency of our results, figure A2 includes the interaction plot
from model 5 for each threshold.

A.3. Continuous location (u ) and scale (u ) effects
[ ]

We conducted additional sensitivity tests using continuous measures of the location (u ) and scale
[ ]

(u ) residuals as well as the three-way interaction with normative alignment (table A5). This leads to
the same substantive conclusions. Specifically, model 3 confirms higher individual cooperation in areas
where mean cooperation is higher. The significant interaction implies that in areas where mean
cooperation is high, normative alignment is unrelated to individual cooperation (or even negatively
related). Model 4 confirms that in areas with more variance in cooperation, individuals are less likely
to cooperate. The significant interaction implies that in areas where variance is high, the effect of
normative alignment is stronger.

For model 5, the results are broadly the same as our presented results. To demonstrate this, figure x
reports the predicted regression lines for the same 4 different area types with a high mean defined as
1sd above the average, and a low mean 1sd below the average (with similar thresholds for the variance).
Figure A3. The effect of normative alignment on willingness to cooperate across neighborhoods

To give some sense of the sensitivity of the results (and significance of the differences) it is informative
to consider whether the 4 plotted regression lines differ significantly from one another (low mean and
low variance, low mean and high variance, high mean and low variance, high mean and high variance
respectively). The table below reports these difference tests for 3 conditions – i) 0.5sd above and below
for mean location and scale, ii) 1sd above and below, and iii) 1.5sd above and below. This is consistent
with the categorical models we report. The results demonstrate consistent evidence that for the ‘lowmean, high-variance’ group there is a more positive relationship between normative alignment and
individual co-operation than for the other groups. At all 3 cut-points (0.5sd, 1sd and 1.5sd) the
normative alignment slope is significantly more positive than the two low variance groups. And for the
1sd and 1.5sd cut points it is also close to significant when compared against the ‘high-mean, highvariance’ group. At the lowest cut-point (.5sd) there is also weak evidence that the ‘high-mean, highvariance’ effect of normative alignment is more positive than the ‘high-mean, low-variance’ group.

30

Whilst this effect gets larger when the other cut-points are considered, it does not reach significance. A
similar non-significant effect is evident when comparing the ‘high-mean, high-variance’ group against
the ‘low-mean, low-variance’ group.

A.4. Impact of small cluster size
In each sampled hexagon an average of 11 face-to-face interviews were conducted giving a total of
1,057 (range 1-21, with 86% have a cluster size of 10 or more). There are 3 hexagons with n=1. To
determine the potential impact of cluster size on our estimates, figure A4 (left plot) plots the hexagon
[ ]
cluster size against the model estimated empirical bayes scale residuals (
). The correlation is very
small (0.016) and there is very little evidence that the magnitude of the scale residuals is being driven
by sample size (see figure A4, right plot for a histogram of the residuals). Furthermore, the average
cluster size for our 4 neighborhood-groups is also similar (ranges in parentheses): Low mean, Low
variance: 10.2 (1-21); Low mean, high variance: 11.1 (3-19); High mean, Low variance: 10.7 (1-15);
High mean, high variance: 10.3 (1-14).
Figure A4. The relationship between hexagon size and scale residuals

Scatterplot of scale residuals against hexagon size

Histogram of scale residuals

To assess the potential impact of the hexagons with n=1 on our results, we re-estimate models 3-5
omitting these 3 hexagons (table A7). The results are almost indistinguishable from those reported in
the main text, therefore we have little reason to think that our results are being driven by the singleton
areas.
