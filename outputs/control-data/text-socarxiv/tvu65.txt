Many, many thanks
This publication could only exist through the generous support of many
people, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks.
Eelco Ferwerda triggered all this, by asking me – in 2008 – to look into
the role of open access on books. While I still feel I have not completely
answered his question, at least we know more since then.
Professor Paul Wouters has guided and challenged me throughout the
PhD project, which started in 2011. Many of the improvements stem from
his patience and knowledge. Since 2015, Professor Frank Huysmans has been
an equally supportive mentor. Most of the chapters have been published
– in open access – and this has been made possible by several publishers,
copy-editors and peer reviewers.
Much of my research revolved around the OAPEN Library and the Directory of Open Access Books. Many people were directly involved: Lotte
Kruijt, Caspar Treijtel, Hans Gommers, Hans Scholte, Salam Baker Shanawa,
Janneke Adema and Paul Needham among many others.
Assistant Professor Lucy Montgomery and Alkim Ozaygen have been
more than generous with their time.
My colleagues at Data Office UWV and my former colleagues at Amsterdam University Press have always been forthcoming, enabling me to juggle
two jobs and this project. I am also grateful for the assistance from CWTS.
Rob Wadman helped to make this document presentable.
My old friend Diebert van Rhijn acted as my IT advisor. All my friends
and my family helped me by not minding my obsession with this seemingly
endless project.
But most of all I want to thank the two most important people in my
life: my wife Dorien and my daughter Charlotte. Without them, I would not
have been able to carry out this crazy project. For this reason – and many,
many more – I dedicate this dissertation to them.

Introduction

This dissertation will discuss the dissemination and usage of open access
monographs, something that I have been working on since 2008. Here, open
access monographs are defined as a scholarly piece of writing of book length
on a specific subject, disseminated online in such a way that its contents
can be read and downloaded without any barrier. Disseminating academic
books in this manner is part of the open access movement, which aims to
make scientific and scholarly content available to all. Peter Suber – considered to be the de facto leader of the open access movement – describes the
rationale as such: “[R]esearch that is worth funding or facilitating is worth
sharing with everyone who can make use of it.” (Suber, 2012).
Platforms for open access monographs are fairly new and they are just
one aspect of the changes in the way scholarly and scientific results are
made public. As I became involved in the development of both the OAPEN
Library and the Directory of Open Access Books, questions on optimization arose. How can we improve these open access book platforms if there
are few examples to learn from? An optimal solution should be based on
evidence and my research on the dissemination and usage of freely available
academic books aims to uncover relevant facts.

2.1

A short history of open access

Starting in 1991, preprints of physics papers were distributed using a central
repository mailbox. The number of articles grew, and the repository expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, quantitative
biology. In 2001, this repository was renamed to arXiv.org. The rise of the
world wide web further enabled worldwide online distribution and in 2002
this idea was captured in the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI)
declaration (Chan et al., 2002), where the term “Open Access” was coined.
In the same year, the first set of Creative Commons licenses was released.
These licenses enable the reuse of the contents in varying degrees. The role
of licenses in the dissemination of open access books will be discussed in
more detail in chapter 5.

16

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

At the start of the twenty-first century, several large scale open access
initiatives were founded: PubMed Central1 and the Public Library of Science.2 Since then, other journal platforms such as PeerJ,3 F1000Research4
and Open Library of Humanities5 have emerged. An important online book
platform, the Google Books program, started in 2002.6 A decade later saw the
launch of several open access monographs platforms. In 2010, the OAPEN
Library 7 was launched. In 2012, the Directory of Open Access Books8 was
introduced, listing monographs contained on several platforms. The next
year, SciELO9 and OpenEdition10 started book platforms.
The introduction of new platforms for journal articles and books is part
of a profound change in scholarly communication: the traditional roles of
participants are changing. Some publishers are building their own digital
collections, a task normally associated with libraries. On the other hand,
academic libraries are starting up publishing activities (Bonn & Furlough,
2015), and publishers like Open Book Publishers or the Open Library of
Humanities are led by academic authors. Lastly, some funders are managing
their own collections, and – through crowdfunding – readers can finance
books. For instance, the Austrian science fund FWF directly places books
in the OAPEN Library (Snijder, 2015). Other funding bodies – such as the
Spanish National Research Council – have chosen to set up an institutional
repository (Bernal, 2013). The organisation Unglue.it uses a crowdfunding
model to pay the rights holders of books to make them available through
an open license. Among other types of books, academic books are part of
the crowdfunding efforts (Howard, 2012).

accessing the contents of the books. This is not exactly the same as reading a monograph. Most of this dissertation’s research is done using the
OAPEN platform. On that platform, it is not possible to measure whether a
monograph has been read; instead the number of downloads is recorded.
In a similar vein, the usage of the Google Book platform is measured as the
number of pages that have been shown, or the number of times a book has
been accessed. The results of the OAPEN Library and Google Books can be
seen as a proxy for reading the books, but “flipping” a page in Google Books
or downloading a book from the OAPEN library is no absolute guarantee
that the person has actually read the monograph.
Many open access advocates stress the importance of reusing the
contents of the scientific or scholarly documents that have been made
available freely. This is supported by open licenses such as the Creative
Commons licenses, which enable a certain amount of reuse by others.
While the importance of reuse is not disputed, I will not discuss it in much
detail. The primary reason is that reuse is even harder to measure than
accessing content. At this very early stage in the development of open access
monograph platforms, there are no reliable indicators available. This is not
limited to reuse. For journal articles, measuring the number of citations is
common practice. For monographs, this is not the case: chapter 9 describes
the difficulties to obtain citations. Thus, in my definition of usage I have
purposefully omitted reuse.
The question whether open access leads to more usage of monographs has
already been settled in other research (Emery et al., 2017; Ferwerda, Snijder,
& Adema, 2013; Snijder, 2010). Making academic books freely accessible
invariably increases the number of pages read online or the number of
copies downloaded; a conclusion that is rather obvious. The next phase is
to examine how to optimize that usage, and whether the increased usage
has positive effects in academia and beyond.
The dissemination of open access monographs depends on platforms
that offer a two-parts solution: a digital collection and the means of dissemination. When a platform is created, its administrators have to make
decisions on what books to include. The collection as a whole will affect
which users will be interested in using the platform, but we will also see
that different aspects of the individual books affect the usage. Throughout
the dissertation, the role of subject and language will be discussed in detail.
However, whether the platform reaches the intended audience depends
not only on its contents. Just as important are the technical possibilities
of the platform. Not just the question of how visitors can interact with the
platform is significant, but also whether the contents can be integrated

18

into other environments. The impact of content integration will be made
visible in chapter 4 and chapter 5.

2.3

Books versus journals

The difference in coverage between articles and monographs is visible in
a recent review article on the impact of open access (Tennant et al., 2016).
It aims to list all current knowledge of this subject, but focuses only on
journal articles as a way to publish scientific or scholarly results. However,
monographs are an important publication type in the humanities and social
sciences. Williams et al. (2009) conclude that “the monograph continues to
enjoy unique appeal and status”, a clear indication of its standing.
Journal articles and monographs differ in several ways. The most obvious
difference is the length: the average number of pages in an article is most
likely around fifteen,11 while the average monograph will contain around
300 pages. The latter publication form is clearly more suited for a thorough
discussion of a subject. However, a longer text also changes the preferred
format: while articles are mostly read digitally, there is still demand for
paper books. In this light, it is understandable that publishers and librarians are interested in the combination of open access and paper versions.
Chapter 3 describes my research into the influence of open access on the
sales of paper copies.
The number of book titles and the number of journal articles differ wildly.
This is illustrated by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and
the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB). In August 2017, the DOAJ
lists over 2.5 million articles. In contrast, the DOAB contains close to 8,900
titles. This difference has economic consequences. Articles tend to be more
standardized, and due to concentration of publishers, economies of scale
can be more easily achieved. In contrast, monographs tend to be treated like
unique projects, and are published by a much larger number of publishers,
considerably differing in size.
The difference in text length also leads to a different pace of interaction:
it takes longer to write a monograph than it takes to create an article. Using
citation analysis based on what is common in journal articles will not lead
to optimal results. Any citation analysis on academic books, such as the
research in chapter 9, has to accommodate for this. If the long “citation
cycles” are problematic, other forms of assessment might be examined: for

instance, by looking at the usage data of open access monographs. This idea
is further investigated in chapter 7 .

2.4

Central thesis and research questions

In the introduction, I described my involvement with the OAPEN Library
and the Directory of Open Access Books. Ultimately, these platforms aim
to share the contents of freely accessible books as widely as possible, which
is measured by the level of usage. While the usage of open access monographs depends on the removal of paywalls, the level of usage is primarily
determined by other factors. Properties of the books such as language and
scholarly field determine the possible readers and the way dissemination
platforms are configured affect whether those readers can actually be
reached.
The question which factors affect the use of open academic books is
quite open-ended. In this dissertation, I will examine three main aspects:
economic sustainability, optimisation of the infrastructure and evaluation
of the results. Economic sustainability of open access monograph publishing
is one of the basic conditions for the platforms: without books, there is no
need for a platform. This leads to the question whether open access has
a positive influence on the sale of monographs. For decades, the uneasy
financial situation surrounding publishing academic books has been known
as “the monograph crisis”. Decreasing sales and rising costs are threatening
the economic sustainability of monograph publishing and publishers are
exploring alternative business models. One of these is the so-called “hybrid
model”, where an online version is made freely available, and paper copies
must be purchased. Will the improved visibility lead to more sales? This is
explored in chapter 3.
In addition to the economic aspects, I have examined the factors affecting the dissemination of open access monographs. Understanding these
factors helps to optimize the platforms. A fundamental question for the
development of both the OAPEN Library and DOAB is how to present the
collection to prospective readers. Should the platform only be accessible as a
“silo”, or should it try to integrate its offering in other systems? The answer to
this question has consequences for the design. The “silo” approach assumes
that humans reach the platform and start searching there, while system
integration requires standardized book metadata that can be imported into
the systems of libraries and aggregators. Chapter 4 deals with this question.

20

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

The optimization of open access platforms is not just dependent on
technical choices. Another thing to consider is collection choices. In the
case of the OAPEN Library, the collection contains books with a license
that permits reuse and books with a more restrictive license. Does this
difference in licensing affect the use? I have compared the usage of the two
sets of books. Within the open access community, licenses that enable reuse
of scholarly content are seen as very important, and chapter 5 examines
whether this preference is also shared by the users of the OAPEN Library.
Furthermore, the influence of aggregation through another platform – the
Directory of Open Access Books – is measured.
Apart from licenses, the users of the OAPEN Library and DOAB may have
other preferences. Understanding those preferences is useful to improve the
platforms, but users are not required to register. Thus, no information about
individuals is stored. The question is how to emulate the successful tactics of
online retailers – that store the preferences of their clients – without violating privacy. A possible solution can be found in deploying social analysis
techniques to discover user communities. See chapter 6.
The next chapters discuss the results of open access monographs dissemination; starting with the question of how to evaluate the effects of
open access monographs. I have examined the possibility to quantify the
effects of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) research, in a way that is
relatively effortless. The results of chapter 7 aim to achieve this goal through
the investigation of usage data.
If the goal of open access is to make research available to everybody, does
it help to overcome the digital divide between the “global north” and the
“global south”? Using open access book platforms requires a functioning
digital infrastructure, which might set back readers in developing countries.
Does open access lead to more usage in developing countries? The answer
can be found in chapter 8. Lastly, I have examined if there is an “open access
advantage” for monographs. It is widely documented for journal articles, but
the effect of open access on citations is largely unknown. The same holds
true for social media. Chapter 9 discusses the question whether open access
monographs are cited more and receive more attention on social media.
I have conducted multiple studies on the usage of open access monographs, which are presented in the following chapters. Each chapter reviews
a different aspect: book sales, digital dissemination, open licenses, user
communities, measuring usage, developing countries and the effects on
citations and social media.

3.1

Introduction

For years, decreasing sales have threatened the sustainability of monograph
publishing and this has led to a search for alternative models. Most of these
proposed models are hybrid: they contain an open access component combined with selling other versions of the book. In this paper, the experiences
of Amsterdam University Press (AUP) in using a hybrid model are analysed
by looking at the effect of open access publishing on monographs sales.
However, several other influences may also affect sales, and these will be
taken into account as well. The goal is to find what effect making books
freely available online has on sales. To achieve this, I shall apply statistical
methods to the sales data of 513 books from a period of three years.
The economic problems concerning monographs have been discussed
by Wasserman and Thompson. Wasserman (1998) discusses the costs of
publishing monographs and the dramatic effects of declining library sales.
Thompson (2005) extensively reviews the challenges – including financial
challenges – facing monograph publishing.
Others look at the possibilities of digital publishing in an open access
model. Greco & Wharton (2008) conclude that university presses cannot
survive on a ‘print-only’ business model and should consider open access
publishing. Steele (2008) draws more or less the same conclusion and describes the open access model as ‘a viable alternative when placed within
institutional settings’. Houghton et al. (2009) discuss the costs of scholarly
publishing – including the costs of monographs – and conclude that open
access publishing is beneficial for society. Withey et al. (2011) acknowledge
a trend towards more open access publishing, but stress the need for sustainable business models. Cross urges academic libraries to support small

22

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

academic publishers by purchasing their monographs (Cross, 2011). Pinter
(2012) also discusses the financial perils of publishing monographs and
proposes a solution in which a consortium of libraries fund an open access
version of a title, enabling the publisher to sell enhanced digital or paper
versions of the book.
Recently, Ferwerda (2014) listed the current business models for open
access and monographs, ranging from a hybrid publication model to crowdfunding. Jackson (2014) – a publisher at Oxford University Press – describes
the current lack of demand for a publishing model in which all costs are
met before publication. At this moment, there is no consensus regarding a
‘proven’ business model.
Some authors also try to find evidence of whether free digital versions
of a book have an effect on sales. Hilton & Wiley (2011) conclude that a
correlation exists between a free e-book and increased print sales. Their
research used an experimental group of eight books and a control group of
six books, both fiction and non-fiction. Snijder (2010) set up an experiment
on monographs, using three experimental groups of 100 title each and a
control group of 100 titles. One result was that making a book freely available
did not affect the number of copies sold. Based on the same principles, the
Dutch-based OAPEN Foundation set up a two-year experiment: OAPEN-NL.
During that period, 50 books were published on open access and also as a
paper monograph. Several aspects – sales among them – were monitored
and compared with a control group of comparable titles published in the
traditional way. The results were similar to Snijder’s results: the number
of copies sold was not affected by publishing on open access (Ferwerda et
al., 2013). In the UK, JISC set up an experiment called OAPEN-UK. Here,
29 ‘matched pairs’ of monographs are compared: one title in each pair is
made available on open access while no changes are made to the other’s
publication model (Collins & Milloy, 2012).
This paper does not follow the same controlled arrangement used by Snijder (2010) or the OAPEN-NL experiment. Instead of investigating carefully
balanced data sets, I use all titles published under one imprint published by
AUP. Whereas the experiment of 2010 used data selected over nine months
of the year 2009, here the time frame is much larger: 36 months, the years
2010 to 2012.
Amsterdam University Press is an academic publisher – owned by the
University of Amsterdam – that publishes monographs and journals, mostly
in the field of humanities and social sciences (AUP, 2012). The Press has
gained extensive experience with open access publishing. The open access
monographs are always made available via a hybrid model in which the

23

print version of the book is sold and a digital version is made available free.
Since 2010, the open access titles published under the imprint ‘Amsterdam
University Press’ have been released not only through AUP’s repository
but also via the OAPEN Library. The OAPEN Library is an important dissemination channel for AUP’s open access books: in April 2014, the Library
contained 447 titles published by AUP.
The OAPEN Library (http://www.oapen.org) was officially launched in
September 2010 (OAPEN Consortium, 2011). It is a web-based collection
of open access monographs published by dozens of publishers. In April
2014, the collection contained over 2100 titles by 68 publishers. The OAPEN
Library offers several ways to access its contents: it enables searching and
browsing, readers can share book descriptions via social media, and it
contains several data feeds (Snijder, 2013a). Amsterdam University Press is
part of the board of the OAPEN Foundation, which maintains the OAPEN
Library.

The data set

In this paper, the following research question will be discussed: what is the
influence of open access on monograph sales and how large is the influence
of open access publishing compared with other influences on monograph
sales? The data set consists of 513 books published under the imprint
‘Amsterdam University Press’. All books published under this imprint are
subject to peer review. The group of books consists of 69 published in 2010,
68 published in 2011, 62 published in 2012, and 319 published between 1995
and 2009. Over 70 per cent of those books – 378 titles – were published on
open access and are available in the OAPEN Library (Table 1).

Of the total number of copies sold during the years 2010–2012, over 65
per cent were open access titles. However, the average number of copies
sold per title was lower, than for titles not published in open access. The

turnover associated with these sales will not be discussed in this paper.
Below, other influences on monograph sales are highlighted.

3.3

Influences on monograph sales

On the basis of the expertise of employees of AUP, several other possible
influences on sales were def ined: commercial potential, frontlist and
backlist, and language. Each influence will be discussed below.
3.3.1

Commercial potential

An important part of the publishing process is determining how well a
title will sell. The publisher will take into account several properties of
the book and predict the number of copies that will sell. This then informs
the print run, the number of copies made available for sale. The print run
of the titles under consideration ranges from zero – no copies are printed
beforehand – to 5000. The average print run of the books available on open
access is lower than the average print run of books that are not available
in this way. The average print run for books on open access is 459, whereas
the average print run for the other titles is 652 (Table 2). In other words, the
expected sales of books that are not available on open access are over 140
per cent of the expected sales of books on open access.

Using a mean print run for a set of 513 titles is rather a crude instrument,
which hides the complex decisions made for each title. Furthermore, if
print runs are declining, this may also influence the data. First of all, the
decline in print runs is not very clear in my data. The average print runs
per publication year range from 286 to 782, without any clear trend. Secondly, the statistical analysis will take into account the sales data of each
individual book per year and not use the averages described here. However,
these averages give us a first clue about the commercial expectations of

25

THE INFLUENCE OF OPEN ACCESS ON MONOGR A PH SALES

the titles that have been made available on open access, compared with
the other titles.
3.3.2

Frontlist and backlist

Publishers refer to the titles published in the current year as the ‘frontlist’;
all other titles are referred to as the ‘backlist’. Experience shows that sales
in the first year are generally higher than sales figures in subsequent years.
This is the case with the books in our data set. The average number of copies
sold of books published in 2011 was twice the average number the next year.
The same holds true for books published in 2010: the average sales in 2010
are almost 2.5 times higher than the average number of copies sold in 2011
(Table 3).

We could also look at the average sales per year. This seems to reveal a
downward trend: in 2010, the average number of copies sold was 104; in 2011,
73; and in 2012, 56. Nevertheless, three years’ data cannot be used to make
conclusions about long-term developments. Moreover, it is possible that the
decline in sales is spread evenly over all titles, regardless of whether they
are published on open access. The study is set up to answer the question of
whether publishing on open access makes a difference, taking into account
the differences in frontlist and backlist sales, and the average sales per year.
3.3.3

Language

The analysed books were either published in Dutch or in English. Dutchlanguage books are more likely to be sold only in Dutch-speaking countries,
whereas English-language books may be sold globally. The differences in

26

potential markets may influence the number of copies sold. In the examined
group of titles, 63 per cent are published in English (Table 4).

Data and Results

Here I measure the effect of the four influences – open access publishing,
commercial potential, front and backlist, language – on sales. The ANOVA
statistical method (analysis of variance) is used to check whether each influence has a significant effect. As a second step, the influences are combined
to see in what way the interaction of these influences affects the number
of books sold. The data are summarized in Table 5.

THE INFLUENCE OF OPEN ACCESS ON MONOGR A PH SALES

3.4.1

27

Separate influences

The effect of each influence is measured using the ANOVA procedure. This
tests whether the differences among the mean sales of the books can be
explained by chance. The results of each individual test are summarized
in Appendix 1: ANOVA results per influence.
It is clear from the results that each influence by itself correlates with
monograph sales in our data. So, while it is true that open access publishing
is connected to sales, this is also true for commercial potential, front and
backlist, and language. We can use two parameters to estimate the size of
the effect: ω2 and F-ratio. The first indicates that both commercial potential
and front and backlist sales have a more profound effect on the number of
copies sold than do open access or language. If we take into account the
F-ratio, there is one outlier: front and backlist sales, whose F-ratio is 51.016,
almost three times larger than the second-highest F-ratio. The difference
between the mean sales of the frontlist and the mean sales of the backlist
also reflect this large effect.
3.4.2

Combining influences

We did see that each influence is statistically significant, and this makes
it harder to single out the effects of open access. It also became clear that
there is a large difference between sales of the frontlist and sales from the
backlist. The mean of all frontlist sales is almost 237, whereas the mean of all
backlist sales is just over 48. In order to compensate for this large difference,
the data are split into frontlist sales and backlist sales. Statistical methods are
applied to these two data sets to measure the effect of open access publishing,
combined with the influence of commercial potential and language.
3.4.3

Frontlist: data and results

The frontlist data consist of the sales data of 199 titles: the titles that were
published in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Only the sales of the first year of publication are taken into account. At first glance, the difference is not very large
between the mean sales of open access books (240.15) and those of books
not available on open access (227.88). This contrasts strongly with language,
where the mean sales of English-language books is approximately 40 per
cent of the mean sales of books published in Dutch. The effects of commercial potential are visible: books with a higher print run did sell better

28

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

on average. A multifactor ANOVA procedure is used to test the effect of the
combined influences.
When we look at the statistical analysis in Appendix 2: Frontlist results,
the results of the frontlist can be explained by a combination of commercial
potential and language. Open Access publishing does not have an effect in this
situation. When we look at the effect size – measured by partial ƞ2 – of both
print run and language, it becomes clear that commercial potential (measured
by print run) plays the largest role. Of course, this is hardly surprising.
3.4.4

Backlist: data and results

The amount of available data from the backlist is much larger. Firstly, it
contains the data of the 314 books published in 2009 and earlier which were
sold during 2010–2012. On top of that, it contains the sales data for the years
2011 to 2012 of the 69 books published in 2010. And, lastly, the 2012 sales of
the 68 books published in 2011 are also part of this set. The mean sales of
the backlist are much lower: the backlist sales are on average 21 per cent
of the frontlist sales mean. Compared with frontlist sales, the difference
between mean sales of books on open access and mean sales of books not
on open access is much larger: 82 for titles not on open access versus just
under 37 for open access books. Still, the total number sold of backlist books
not on open access is roughly 70 per cent of the number of backlist open
access books sold.
Using the same procedure as before, the results for the backlist can be
explained by a combination of commercial potential and open access.
Language does not play a significant role. The results are listed in Appendix 3: Backlist results. Still, to get meaningful results from a multifactor
ANOVA procedure, several preconditions must be met. The most important
precondition is homogeneity of variance. In other words, the means used in
the procedure should be evenly spread. The backlist data did not meet this
condition, and so we must interpret the results with caution.
As a possible solution to overcome the statistical problems, the data can
be split into smaller samples based on ‘print run groups’. This creates four
subsets of books with the same commercial potential, where each subset
contains books that are published on open access and books that are not.
Creating these subsets enables us to measure the effect of open access while
controlling for the effects of commercial expectations. As a consequence,
the subsets contain fewer data; this is most noticeable with the set ‘print
run 2001–3000’, where the number of data items is as low as 20 (N = 20). For

29

THE INFLUENCE OF OPEN ACCESS ON MONOGR A PH SALES

each set, a one-way ANOVA procedure is performed to test the influence
on open access on sales.
Table 6 presents the mean sales of books in the backlist, sorted by print
run. The most striking difference between open access books and books not
on OA can be found for print runs between 1001 and 2000. In this relatively
small group (N = 92), the mean sale of titles not on open access is 201.94,
compared with 68.21 for titles published on open access. Consistent with
the discussion in the introduction, most of the titles published have small
print runs: 1000 or less. In the group of titles with a print run of zero and the
group of titles with a print run between 1 and 1000, the difference in mean
sales between open access books and books not on open access is smaller.

When the sales data are analysed using statistical methods, we see that
open access publishing is a significant – negative – influence on the average
number of copies sold in certain cases only: the subsets of books whose
print run is between 1 and 1000 or between 1001 and 2000. No significant
effect on books with a print run of zero or between 2001 and 3000 could be
measured. Furthermore, the measured effect of open access on sales is much
higher for the books with a print run between 1001 and 2000 than for the
books with a print run between 1 and 1001. The results are fully described
in Appendix 3: Backlist results.
At first glance, the outcomes of this paper run counter to the results
of Snijder (2010) and OAPEN-NL (Ferwerda et al., 2013). Here we see that
making books available on open access has affected sales in certain circumstances. However, when we look at the total number of copies sold, the
effects are not as strong as might be expected. This is best explained using
the following illustrations.

30

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

In Figure 1, the backlist sales of titles with a print run between 1 and
1000 are highlighted. The mean sales of books published in closed access
are higher than those of books published in open access. However, the total
number of copies sold is much lower: it amounts to 8 per cent of all sales.
In contrast, the number of copies sold of titles under open access is 21 per
cent of all sales.

The backlist sales of titles with a print run between 1001 and 2000 are
highlighted in Figure 2. Here, the difference between mean sales of open
access titles and those of titles not on open access is quite large: 68 versus
202. This does not lead to an equally large difference in total sales. We can
see that 10 per cent of all copies sold are have a print run between 1001 and
2000. Here, four per cent are published on open access and six per cent that
are not made available in this way.

Discussion

Sales of monographs are influenced by several factors, and this paper tries
to measure the effects of open access publishing, commercial potential,
front and backlist sales, and language. The results show that all factors
are influential, but the strengths of the measured effect are not equal.
The difference between front and backlist sales is by far the greatest, and
it was necessary to split the data to find meaningful results for the other
influences.
The data used here did not come from a carefully set up experiment.
Instead there was a bias in commercial expectations: the mean print run
of the open access titles was 70 per cent of that of the books not published
on open access. The difference is reflected in the mean sales of the two
groups: the mean sales of open access titles are over 63 per cent of the mean
sales of books not on open access. We might conclude that the lower commercial expectations of OA books is reflected in the mean sales. However,
the number of open access titles available is larger, and the total number
of copies sold is also larger: over 65 per cent of all sales.
The main question to answer is whether open access publishing is affecting the sales of monographs and how it compares with other influences

32

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

on monograph sales. The results for frontlist sales are clear: no significant
effect of open access on sales could be found, after controlling for the effect
of print run and language.
The answer for backlist sales is a bit more nuanced. Owing to limitations
of the data, it is not possible to run the same procedure as used for the
frontlist. Instead the backlist titles were split into four groups based on
the commercial expectations. Taking into account this division, we can
conclude that open access publishing has no effect on books with a print
run of zero or between 2001 and 3000. Moreover, where an effect could be
found, the effect size is quite different for categories of print run: a small
effect for books with a print run between one and 1000 and a large effect
for books with a print run between 2001 and 3000.
In the subsets of books with a print run higher than 0 but below 2000,
open access has a negative effect. Nevertheless, the group of books with a
print run between one and 1000 is very heavily skewed towards open access
books: the data analysed contain over 3.6 times more data items (N = 509)
for titles available under OA than data items for closed access titles (N =
136). The difference between the mean sales is much less: the mean sales of
books not on open access is almost 1.5 times the mean sales of open access
books in this group. This amounts to a much higher sale of copies of books
on open access: almost 21 per cent of the total sales, compared with just
over eight per cent for books not on open access. In an economic sense, the
negative effect is not very important. The differences in the group of books
with a print run between 1001 and 2000 are much more dramatic. But in this
case the groups are small (with open access: N = 61; without open access: N
= 31) and the number of books sold is 10 per cent of all sales. It is likely that
the influence on revenue will not be very large.
From these data, it is not clear why sales of paper monographs are so
lightly affected by free online versions. For a possible answer, we could look
again at Snijder (2010) and OAPEN-NL (Ferwerda et al., 2013; Snijder, 2010).
There, academic libraries are described as a major purchaser of monographs.
As long as availability on open access is not taken into account when paper
monographs are acquired, the same pattern keeps emerging. However, we
also saw that sales of monographs – whether available on open access or
not – are far from soaring. Lack of budget at academic libraries is probably
a major factor, as illustrated in (“Association of Research Libraries (ARL) ::
ARL Statistics 2009-10,” 2012).
The introduction to this paper discussed the sustainability of the current
monograph publication system. From the results in the paper, we can conclude that using a hybrid model or closed access only does not make a large

THE INFLUENCE OF OPEN ACCESS ON MONOGR A PH SALES

33

difference to sales. The model under research does not lead to more sales of
open access monographs, and the loss of sales is negligible. The data suggest
that a hybrid model in which open access versions are made available in
combination with paid-for print versions does not change the status quo.
If the status quo is considered to be a broken publication system, a hybrid
model is not an option to change things for the better. However, publishers
who do well from selling paper monographs could consider making their
titles available on open access as a way to enlarge the number of readers.
Publishers who are making losses on monographs may want to change
their business model in a more radical way than adopting a hybrid model.

3.6

Limitations

The data set used in this paper is large: it contains the sales data of 513
titles sold over a period of three years. Results from a large data set are less
prone to be influenced by outliers, which helps to validate the outcomes.
Nevertheless, the results are derived from one publisher and this makes it
hard to establish whether other aspects – such as reputation or marketing
budget – have influenced the results. Owing to the properties of the used
sales data, the analysis was carried out on smaller subsets. Further research
could establish whether the role of open access publishing in a hybrid model
really is so small.

Modes of access : The influence of
dissemination channels on the use of
open access monographs

Introduction

Open access is much debated and in recent years has gained much attention
in the literature. The scientific and scholarly impact of papers has been
discussed extensively, for instance by Antelman (2004), who finds that freely
published papers receive more citations – across a number of disciplines.
Podlubny (2005) takes the citation analysis a step further and proposes
a normalisation procedure, aimed at comparing the impact of scientists
from different fields. Bollen et al. go beyond citations and investigate 39
impact measures, and conclude that “usage-based measures” may be a
better indication of scientific impact (Bollen, Van de Sompel, Hagberg, &
Chute, 2009).
Not only is the impact hotly debated but the economic aspects have also
received much attention. A major discussion point is the merits of publishing a free version of a paper next to the ‘official’ version in a journal which
is not freely accessible (green open access), versus the merits of directly
publishing in an open access journal (gold open access) (Harnad et al., 2004,
2008). Recently, the report Accessibility, Sustainability, Excellence: how to
expand access to research publications by Finch et al. was heavily discussed
(Finch et al., 2013).
The discussion on the effects of open access on monographs does not
attract the same amount of attention so far, and the amount of available
research is small. Apart from running the OAPEN Library, the OAPEN
foundation is currently involved in two pilot projects in the Netherlands
(“OAPEN.nl website - English,” n.d.) and the UK (“JISC - OAPEN-UK,” n.d.)
experimenting with open access monograph publishing. The first results of
the OAPEN-UK pilot are discussed by Collins & Milloy (2012). In September

40

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

2013, the results of the Dutch pilot project were published (Ferwerda et al.,
2013).

4.2

Dissemination channels

This paper will focus on a different aspect: dissemination channels. In the
literature on open access, dissemination channels seem to be a given. If it
is discussed at all, dissemination is described as making papers available
in an institutional repository. This paper is the first to analyse the effects
of several dissemination channels in an open access environment.
Here we examine the monograph downloads of the OAPEN Library,
which was officially launched in September 2010 (OAPEN Consortium,
2011; Open Access Publishing in European Networks, 2010b). It is a Web
based collection of monographs, mainly in the field of Humanities and
Social Sciences (HSS). All books are available in open access and users
can search the Website in several ways. Each book also has a unique Web
address and can be downloaded directly without searching the Website.
These addresses – combined with metadata describing the books – are made
available on the OAPEN Website and through several aggregators. This is
described in more detail in Snijder (2013a).
This paper examines the download data of the OAPEN Library, which
was gathered during a period of six months. The data consists of the number
of downloads per month per provider. Here we define a provider as the
organisation that grants the user access to the internet. Furthermore, the
data contains information on whether a book was downloaded via the
OAPEN Website or directly. Because the data were aggregated monthly, we
can distinguish three situations: firstly, a book was downloaded a certain
number of times through a provider via the Website only; secondly, a book
was downloaded a certain number of times through a provider using the
direct download address of the book; thirdly, a book was downloaded a
certain number of times through a provider via the Website and also a
certain number of times directly. In the last case, the readers related to that
provider use a combination of ways to access the book.
It is not unreasonable to assume that each provider caters for several
people. In the case where all readers only use the Website or only use direct
downloads, their preference seems to be aligned. If – in the same month – a
portion of the readers use the Website and another portion of the readers
prefer direct downloads, this may hint at another ‘group configuration’.
In this case, other aspects of usage could also differ, which is why this is

MODES OF ACCESS

analysed separately. Thus, the download data stems from three channels:
Website only, Website and direct access; and direct access only.
As the data is available through several channels, it may be useful to
investigate the literature on multichannel management. This field looks at
the challenges that retailers face in the deployment of multiple channels
to reach their customers. While typical research in this field looks at the
differences between offline channels such as stores and online channels
such as Websites, parts of the theoretical framework could be applied to
this paper.
The multichannel management framework is based on theories on the
adoption of innovations, explaining if and why people will use new channels. On this layer, the specific aspects of working with multiple (retail)
channels are discussed. According to Rogers (1995), several factors influence
the use of innovations: the relative advantage of the innovation, its fit with
existing usage patterns, the perceived complexity, the ability to try out the
innovation, the perceived risk related to adoption, and the degree to which
adoption and use can be observed by others (Rogers, 1995).
The work of Rogers is paired to the technology adoption model (TAM)
and its extension TAM2. TAM states that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are drivers of innovation adoption; TAM2 extends this
framework to social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness,
and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output
quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) (Davis, 1989;
Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Neslin et al.
identified five “key challenges” in multichannel management: data integration, understanding customer behaviour, channel evaluation, allocating
resources across channels and coordinating channel strategies. In a later
paper, the list of relevant aspects has grown to thirteen (Neslin et al., 2006;
Neslin & Shankar, 2009). Basically, the questions revolve around whether
or not to deploy a multichannel strategy, how to set up different channels,
and how to evaluate the results.
What aspects of multichannel management can be used here? Instead
of offline versus online channels, we are discussing different online
channels. We envision different users with different needs. They are not
paying customers, and researching and ‘purchasing’ in an open access
environment are more or less the same action. Searching for information
in the field of humanities and social sciences is covered by many authors.
Shen discusses the many channels used by social scientists, grouping them
in internal and external electronic and paper resources, combined with
“external human resources” Shen (2007, p.8). Bulger et al. discuss humanities

42

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

scholar’s search behaviour through six use cases where scholars employed
a range of resources and technologies (Bulger et al., 2011). Wang et al. use
an international angle by discussing the scholars in the USA, Greece and
China (Wang, Dervos, Zhang, & Wu, 2007). Griffiths and Brophy focus on
students’ online search behaviour, and describe the strong preference for
search engines – especially Google – compared to the library catalogue or
other sources (Griffiths & Brophy, 2005). Lamothe discusses the growing
usage of e-books in an academic library (Lamothe, 2010).
Channel evaluation also has implications for resource management:
the results help to decide where to invest the most time and money. This
goes beyond managing IT systems, it also affects marketing decisions. In
short, multichannel management aims to create an optimal strategy in a
given environment.
If we combine search behaviour with the decision to use a specific channel, we arrive at the following research question: does the usage based
on the channel “Website only” differ from usage based on “direct access
only” or from usage from a combination of those channels? The answer
has implications for open access publishing as it may help to optimise the
dissemination of open access monographs.
First, the download data is analysed quantitatively: counting the number
of downloads per channel. Then, the qualitative analysis tries to find an
answer to the question of whether properties of the users, their infrastructure or the properties of the book themselves have a significant impact on
the usage per channel.

4.3

Quantitative analysis

In this section, the data set is described, followed by the number of downloads per channel. The number of monograph downloads is an indication
of readership. Whilst we can assume that the more a monograph has been
downloaded, the more it has been read we cannot, however, state that 100
downloads equal equates to 100 people reading the monograph cover to
cover.
4.3.1

The data set

The data set consists of the download data of 979 books, published by thirtyfive different publishers. The books are published in ten different languages.
By far the largest number of the downloaded books are in English. The 979

43

monographs in the data set were downloaded 152,662 times in the first six
months of 2012.

We saw that the 979 books were downloaded 152,662 times in the first six
months of 2012. The books were accessed through 6176 different providers
which are based in 166 countries. We stated before that a provider is defined
as the organisation that grants the user access to the internet. In some cases,
the provider is an organisation such as a university or a government agency.
In other cases, this is an Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as Comcast
in the USA or Ziggo in the Netherlands. The providers will be discussed in
more detail in the qualitative analysis.

4.3.2

Downloads per dissemination channel

The downloads were measured per provider per channel per month. So, if
a provider downloaded the same monograph more than once in the same
month, using the same channel, the number of downloads were added.
In some instances, a provider downloaded a monograph several times a
month via the Website and also via direct access. In those cases, the downloads were added to the combined channel “Website and direct access”.
In other instances, a monograph was only downloaded via the Website,
or the monograph was only downloaded through direct access only. Then
the downloads were added to the channels “Website only” or “direct access
only” respectively.
Using this procedure, the following data becomes available:

The data shows that usage is dominated by direct access only. This implies
that almost three quarters of all downloads come from users who do not
use the Website http://www.oapen.org/, but find the books via other means.
This kind of usage is made possible by making the metadata12 of the books
– including a direct download URL – directly available to all interested
parties, including libraries and content aggregators. The channel “Website
and direct access” contains a combination of downloads via the Website
and direct access. Here again, the portion of downloads via direct access is
larger than the downloads via the Website. It is clear that most readers find
the books through other routes than the OAPEN Library Website.
The usage data revealed that 24% of the visits to the OAPEN Library
Website lead to downloading one or more titles. However, this percentage cannot be compared to the usage data of other systems. If 100 OAPEN
monographs were downloaded via a library catalogue, how many searches
were conducted which did not result in a download taking place? Therefore,
we do not know whether the OAPEN Library Website is a more efficient
way to search compared to other systems.
12 The metadata is licensed under a Creative Commons Zero licence, which makes it free to
use under any circumstance.

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

We discussed before that multichannel management aims to create an
optimal strategy in a given environment. The goal of open access publishing
is to remove barriers to access, and it makes sense to investigate how to
maximize the dissemination of open access monographs. We saw that the
direct access channel is far more used than the other channels and this
has serious consequences for managing and optimising the service: from a
dissemination point of view it makes more sense to invest in metadata and
the dissemination of metadata then to spend resources on the Website. It
is important that any system used for open access dissemination is capable
of exporting metadata in formats that can be used by content aggregators
or the systems used by prospective readers. Apart from library catalogues,
search engines may be a much-used research tool, and investing resources
in optimal coverage by the likes of Google and Bing may be beneficial.

4.4

Qualitative analysis

The goal of the qualitative analysis is to establish whether user’s characteristics (i.e. their infrastructure) or the collection are influential factors
on channel usage. Firstly, user characteristics are discussed. The download
percentages of the quantitative analysis are used as a benchmark, and are
compared to the actual values found using an independent t-test. A factor
is considered influential if the difference between the usage numbers is
statistically significant and the effect size is not small.
4.4.1

Characteristics of users and dissemination channels

Readers are placed in several groups: academic; government; business; nonprofit organisations and the general public. While academic users could be seen
as the main audience for monographs, readers of other backgrounds have equal
access to the monographs in the OAPEN Library. The users are categorised
based on the data from the OAPEN logs, combined with public data.
The OAPEN Library is a Web based service, and its logs contain the Web
address of the providers. So, if researchers at Leiden University download
a book using their office equipment, the Web address (www.leidenuniv.
nl) of that university will be logged. Basic information such as address
and telephone number are publicly available and can be found using the
so called ‘WHOIS protocol’ (“WHOIS - Wikipedia,” n.d.). By combining the
usage data and information about the provider, we can make assumptions
about who is downloading a specific monograph.

MODES OF ACCESS

47

A large portion of the providers are not universities or government
agencies, but internet service providers (ISP). If the provider is an ISP, the
user cannot be linked to an organisation. We cannot assume that all usage
through an ISP comes from people browsing the internet at home. If the
internet infrastructure in a certain country is highly developed, chances
are that each organisation is capable of giving direct internet access to their
members. If the internet infrastructure is less well developed, a large portion
of the organisations in that country do not directly provide internet access
but rely on the services of an Internet Service Provider.
Of course, it is always possible that ‘ISP users’ from a country with a
highly-developed internet infrastructure are in fact academics working
from home after office hours. The available data does not contain the (local) time of the download, which makes determining whether a reader is
downloading during office hours impossible. Furthermore, if the reader is
not acting in a professional capacity, the chances are also higher that the
download started after office hours. The difference in access to scholarly
and scientific literature for academics compared to others is quite large;
using the credentials of the academic institution allows direct access to all
kinds of literature behind pay walls. It might therefore be more efficient
to use these credentials not only at the office, but also after office hours.
If we want to divide ISP usage in those two categories, we need a way to
determine the state of a country’s infrastructure. This is done by using a
World Bank publication: The Little Data Book on Information and Communication Technology 2011 (World Bank & Lewandowski, 2010). It lists several
statistics per country, and one of them is the number of internet users per
100 people. If there is a connection between the state of the infrastructure
and the percentage of downloads through ISPs, the percentage of ‘ISP usage’
is lower for highly developed internet infrastructures.
This assumption was tested by charting the measured downloads from
thirty countries and the percentage of ISP usage. The found values were set
against the amount of internet users per 100 people. Because the country
of each provider is known, it was possible to select the countries with the
highest number of downloads. The selected thirty countries are responsible
for almost 92% of all downloads.
The first chart depicts the percentage of downloads via an ISP, sorted
by the amount of internet users per 100 people. In this chart, we see that
there is a trend toward a higher percentage of downloads via an ISP, when
the number of internet users per 100 people decreases.

Here we see a decrease from 91.8 internet users per 100 people in Norway
to 5.3 internet users per 100 people in India. Somewhere between these
two extremes we need to set a cut-off point to determine which countries
have a highly-developed internet infrastructure. Within these countries,
the chances are higher that ISP usage from these countries is from “nonprofessional” users. This distinction is used in the qualitative analysis, to
determine whether the internet infrastructure influences downloads via
the different channels.

between Switzerland with 70.9 internet users and Hungary with 61.6 internet users per 100 people. Based on this, the threshold is set to seventy internet

people are considered to have a highly-developed infrastructure. The same
threshold is also used in (Snijder, 2013b).
4.4.2

Type of users and dissemination channels

Now we can look at the download percentages of the different user groups.
The number of downloads per channel differ wildly and because of that,
there is a large difference in the absolute number of downloads per group.
For instance, the number of downloads by academic readers through the
“direct access only” channel is almost seven times the number of academic
downloads through the Website only.
Is there a connection between user type and dissemination channel?
Regardless of the channel, most of the usage comes from three groups:
Academic, ISP and ISP high internet usage. As academics are the intended
audience for monographs, it is not very surprising to see a large proportion of usage that originates from academic institutions. Furthermore,
the academic community is large. As discussed before, it was not possible
to determine whether the role of users in the group “ISP” was academic
or otherwise. The members of the group “ISP – high internet” are more
likely to be ‘non-professional’ users. Based on that we might conclude that
disseminating open access books helps to make scholarly content available

50

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

to the public. In all channels, the usage by non-profit, government and business organisations is small, compared to academic and ISP related usage.
From the quantitative analysis it becomes clear that 8% of the usage
comes from the channel Website only, 19% from the channel Website
and direct access, and 73% through direct access only. We can use these
percentages as a baseline for the expected downloads for each user group,
and compare it to actual number of downloads per channel. Using the
difference between those amounts – expressed as the percentage of the
expected value – we find no significant effect for user type: t(17) = -0.541,
p = .595. Based on the lack of significant differences on channel usage, we
can conclude that the type of user plays a minimal role in channel usage.

Characteristics of internet infrastructure

Dividing the internet structure in highly developed and less well developed
countries is not only useful to differentiate between user groups but is, in
itself, also a possible influence on channel usage. We might expect that
readers from countries with a highly-developed infrastructure have different download patterns compared to those with more limited bandwidth.
Annex 1 lists the countries with highly developed infrastructure. When we
look at overall usage – not taking into account the different channels – the
difference between the two groups is clear: the number of downloads from
countries with a highly-developed infrastructure is more than twice the
number of downloads from the rest of the world.
The same percentages as before are used as a baseline for the expected
downloads, and again those numbers are compared to the actual number
of downloads per channel. Using the difference between those amounts –
expressed as the percentage of the expected value – we find no significant
effect for internet infrastructure: t(5) = -0.418, p = .639. Based on the lack

of significant differences on channel usage, we can conclude that internet
infrastructure plays a minimal role in channel usage.

Is there a connection between characteristics of the content – the monographs – and dissemination channels? In this section, we examine two
aspects: subject and language. Not all languages or subjects will be analysed:
the three most downloaded languages and ten most downloaded subjects
are examined.
4.4.5

Language and dissemination channels

It seems obvious that language influences the use of the monographs, as
readers are unlikely to download a book in a language they cannot read.
The high usage of monographs in the English language is directly visible,
but we have to take into account the large number of books available in
that language. The question is whether language usage differs significantly
from expected values.
In the description of the data set, we saw that 52.6% of the books were
written in English, 16.7% in German and 12.9% in Dutch. If we apply these
percentages to the number of downloads per dissemination channel, we
can compute the expected values. Using the difference between those
amounts – expressed as the percentage of the expected value – we find no
significant effect for language: t(11) = -1.229, p = .245. Based on the lack of
significant differences on channel usage, we can conclude that language
of the monographs does not play a role in channel usage.

Still, the percentage of downloads of English language books via the Website is relative high, and this raises the question of whether users primarily
search using English terms. To test this, a small sample was analysed. Of all
queries in one month, a list was created of searches that occurred at least
twice. This created a set of 2,219 different queries.

The percentage of ‘non-English’ queries was more that 51%. Nevertheless,
this group also contained search terms that exist not only in the English
language, but also in Dutch and German. If we analyse this group, five
‘ambiguous’ terms account for more than 62% of queries: “film”; “water”;
“IMISCOE”; “Iran”; “Islam”. So, a large percentage of all the examined queries
are at least ‘compatible’ to English. It is therefore safe to assume that most
searches are indeed in English, which would partly explain the results. The
large amount of available English language books might be another factor.

Subject and dissemination channels

The last aspect to analyse is the subject of the monographs. Are the users
of the OAPEN Library interested in certain subjects or do the download
patterns closely follow the spread of subjects amongst the books? We have
found the percentages of titles with a certain subject in the quantitative
analysis. The expected number of downloads per channel are computed by
applying these percentages to the number of books downloaded per channel,
and the actual number of downloads are compared against the benchmark
values. Using the difference between those amounts – expressed as the
percentage of the expected value – we find no significant effect for subject:
t(32) = 1.507, p = .142. Based on the lack of significant differences on channel
usage, we can conclude that subject does not play a role in channel usage.

However, when a dissemination channel is used more – the channel
“direct access only” is used for of 73.1% of all downloads, while usage
through the Website only is 7.6% – the number of subjects also grows. This
is illustrated by the fact that the ten subjects listed here cover almost 74% of

54

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

all downloads occurring via the Website only. In contrast, the percentages
drop for the other channels to 63.8%.

4.5

Conclusions

This paper is the first to analyse the effects of several dissemination channels in an open access environment. Its goal is to help determine an optimal
strategy to achieve maximum distribution of open access monographs.
The books are made available via the OAPEN Library Website, via direct
downloads or a combination of those two. It is interesting to note that a large
proportion of readers who directly download the monographs do not use
the Website; they have found the description of the books via other means.
From the quantitative analysis, the dominance of one channel is clear.
The data shows that 73% of all downloads occurred via the channel “direct
download”. This implies that almost three quarters of downloads come from
users who do not use the Website http://www.oapen.org/, but find the books
through other systems or Websites.
The qualitative analysis revealed that regardless of the channel, most
usage comes from three groups: Academic, ISP and ISP high internet usage.
Other user groups – Business, Government and Non-profit – are not highly
represented. When looking at the usage per group, no effect on channel
usage could be established. The internet infrastructure is another factor
that was taken into account. While the digital divide between users from
countries with a highly-developed internet infrastructure and users from
less well-off countries is very clear, no effect on channel usage could be
found. The same holds true for the aspects of the books themselves: the
analysis could not find any effect on channel usage for both the language
and subjects of the monographs.
The goal of multichannel analysis is to determine the optimal usage of
resources: what configuration leads to the best results? The definition of
“best results” in an open access environment differs from a commercial
environment. The objective is not financial gain, but maximum dissemination. In the OAPEN Library, readers can access books via three channels.
Firstly, the Website, which is optimised for search – it does not only contain
metadata, but also enables full text search. Furthermore, it contains browsing functions as a means to enable serendipity. In contrast to this, the direct
search channel functions in a different way. It is based on metadata only,
which is incorporated into systems outside the OAPEN Library. Full text

MODES OF ACCESS

search on the contents of the books is not possible. The third channel is a
combination of both.
The results show that most readers are using the “direct download”
channel, in spite of the fact that the OAPEN Library Website offers functions that are not available via other channels. A possible answer may
be found in the theoretical models on the use of innovations discussed
in the introduction. There we saw several factors influencing the use of
new systems, such as its fit with existing usage patterns, perceived ease
of use and social norms. It is possible that users of the “direct download”
channel prefer their ‘own’ systems, which are familiar and are part of their
routine and environment. In that case, learning to use a new interface
may not be seen as a worthwhile investment. But who are the principal
users of the OAPEN Library? The analysis revealed that current users are
based in academic institutions or use an ISP. Users based in businesses,
governmental or non-profit organisations are far less common. Also, the
digital divide between upcoming countries and the ‘developed’ countries is
a large factor: two-thirds of the downloads occurred from countries with a
highly-developed internet infrastructure. And although the OAPEN Library
contains books in German, Dutch, Italian and other languages, the majority
of the books – and the majority of the readers – use English.
How does this compare to the goal of maximum dissemination? A
recurring theme in the discussion on open access is making scientific and
scholarly results available to members of academia who cannot access the
information behind a pay wall. Seen from that perspective, the current
situation is quite a success: academic institutions are responsible for a large
portion of the downloads. However, when we look at other possible patrons,
the picture is less rosy. In the collection of the OAPEN Library, the subjects
politics & government, society & culture and sociology & anthropology are
well covered. Those books may contain useful information for governmental
organisations – for instance in the field of immigration studies, which is a
much-debated topic in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, there is not
much usage from governmental organisations, nor from non-profit organisations. Does the form – monographs – not fit within the informational habits
of those potential users, or is the OAPEN collection not embedded in the
information systems used?
When we compare the usage from countries with a highly-developed
internet infrastructure to the usage from the rest of the world, the difference
is striking. The first group of countries contains twenty-seven countries, yet
it has downloaded twice as much as books. Here we see that making books
freely available does not automatically take away other barriers to access.

56

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

The language of the publications may be another issue to research. More
than half of the analysed books are written in English, and the download
percentage of English language books is also roughly 50%. It is possible
that the overall usage is at least partly shaped by the number of books
available in a certain language. In other words, if the collection contained a
larger percentage of monographs in another language – for instance French,
Spanish and Portuguese – how might that affect the usage?
The results imply that making the metadata available in the user’s systems – the infrastructure used on a daily basis – ensures the best results.
So, to achieve the optimum amount of usage, firstly we must identify users
who are not using the data; secondly, we have to understand how they
search for information and thirdly we have to establish what is the best
way to make our data available. Researching those questions would bring
the goal of maximum dissemination a little closer. These challenges are not
only faced by the OAPEN Foundation, but are shared by all organisations
that disseminate open access publications or data.

4.6

Limitations

The data set used in this paper is large and rich: it contains the data of
979 monographs which were downloaded 152,662 times in the first six
months of 2012. Several aspects of the monographs are described: language
and subject. Furthermore, several characteristics of each download are
available: the name of the provider and the channel used.
Nevertheless, as there is no authority data obtainable, the categorisation
of the providers is not checked. Another aspect linked to the categorisation
of providers is determining its country of origin, based on the available
WHOIS information which always links one country to a provider. If an
organisation operates in several countries – such as a NGO or a multinational – this will not be reflected in the data. Also, the subject information
of the books has been simplified. These aspects may have had an influence
on the qualitative analysis.
The timeframe could also be considered. The data was captured during a
six-month period, and owing to the rapid pace of technological development
on the internet, it would be interesting to compare the results with data
from another period. Because this research is the first of its kind, no best
practises have been established.

Better sharing through licenses? :
Measuring the influence of Creative
Commons licenses on the usage of
open access monographs

Introduction

Open access (OA) and content licenses are closely intertwined. The first
Budapest open access Initiative declaration (Chan et al., 2002) – widely
seen as the official birth of the open access movement – does not explicitly
state the need for a license, but the Berlin Declaration (“Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities,” 2003)
and the Bethesda Statement (Suber et al., 2003) pose two conditions: a
license permitting distribution and reuse; and a deposit of the contents in
a technically suitable manner. The goal of the open access movement is to
disseminate scholarly and scientific knowledge as widely as possible, and
using licenses to systematically remove the barriers created by copyright
restrictions is an important tool.
One of the best-known licenses used to achieve this is the Creative
Commons (CC) license. The Creative Commons organisation describes its
set of licenses as a “simple, standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work – on conditions of your choice.”
(“About - Creative Commons,” n.d.) These licenses enable the copyright
owner to allow certain types of usage – such as copying or modifying the
contents – while constricting other forms of use, for instance by prohibiting
commercial reuse. The six licenses vary in the amount of restrictions placed
on the reuse of the work.
Beyond alerting individual users of their reuse rights, there is another
important aspect to these licenses. Placing Creative Commons license code
on digital content not only provides a human readable license, but also

62

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

provides a machine readable version of the license, enabling computers to
determine in what way the content may be reused (Lessig, 2004). Machine
readable licenses enable others to create automated services, based on the
type of reuse granted by the content owner.
Although both Creative Commons and the open access movement seek to
restore the balance between the owners of creative works and the prospective users, not all Creative Commons licenses are considered equally ‘open’
by OA proponents. For example, the BOAI now recommends a specific CC
license: CC-BY (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2012). According to the
open access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) this license allows
for unrestricted reuse of content, as long as the source work is appropriately
attributed (Redhead, 2012).
The preference for this license is not undisputed13; and has led to discussions about the relative merits of the degree of openness provided by
the different CC licenses. In this paper, we will use a simpler distinction:
documents which are available without charge, and documents that are
not only available without charge, but also made available under a license
that enables reuse and further dissemination. Peter (Suber, 2008) coined
the terms ‘gratis’ and ‘libre’ OA to distinguish between these two distinct
forms of ‘open access’. Throughout this paper, books published under any
type of CC license are categorised as libre open access; all other freely accessible books are categorised as gratis OA. In other words, books published
under open licences ranging from CC-BY to CC-BY-NC-ND are here defined
as libre;14 books which are only ‘free to read’ and may not be freely used
otherwise are defined as gratis.
Because documents which have been released under a libre license – such
as Creative Commons – carry fewer barriers to reuse, it stands to reason
that such content is easier to share and more likely to be used. This paper
examines a discrete collection of open access monographs – the OAPEN
Library collection – in an attempt to determine whether libre licenses do
in fact lead to greater use of open access works.

13 A recent example is the interview with Paul Royster (Poynder, 2014).
14 Although the most restrictive CC licenses do not permit the adaptation of content, they
still allow greater reuse than a gratis license that restricts users to the personal use rights under
copyright law.

The OAPEN Library and the DOAB

The OAPEN Library was officially launched in September 2010 (OAPEN
Consortium, 2011). It is a web-based collection of open access monographs,
published by dozens of publishers. In December 2013, the collection contained over 2,000 titles by 55 publishers. The OAPEN Library offers several
ways to make its contents accessible: it enables searching and browsing,
readers can share book descriptions via social media, and it also offers
several data feeds (Open Access Publishing in European Networks, 2010b).
In the OAPEN Library, books are made available under several licenses:
roughly 50% of the titles are disseminated under a Creative Commons
license, while the rest are made available under a more restrictive regime.
In other words, about half the titles in the OAPEN Library are available as
gratis OA, the other half as libre OA.
The OAPEN Library is managed by the OAPEN Foundation. In April
2012, the OAPEN Foundation launched the Directory of Open Access Books
(DOAB) as a discovery service for open access books (“DOAB: Directory of
Open Access Books,” n.d.). The directory is open to all academic publishers
and aims to contain as many books as possible, provided that these books
are peer-reviewed and published under an open access license. In addition
to the publishers already taking part in OAPEN, several other academic
publishers have placed their books in the DOAB (Snijder, 2013a). The DOAB
is connected to the OAPEN Library, and automatically uploads descriptions
of new titles from OAPEN. However, not all books in the OAPEN Library are
listed in the DOAB: it only contains the titles with a Creative Commons – or
a comparable – license. The selection is not limited to CC-BY, but extended
to the full range of CC licenses. So, while the OAPEN Library is a mixture
of gratis and libre OA, the DOAB only lists libre OA books. This automated
aggregation – based on the machine-readable licence information – results
in extra exposure of the libre books in the OAPEN Library.

5.3

Examining the Impact of Licenses on use

The OAPEN Library and the DOAB are examples of two types of use of open
access works: use by individual end users and use by intermediaries, who
provide additional services built on or around open content. Here, the end
users are the readers of the books contained in the OAPEN Library. Use
by this group can be measured by counting the number of times a book
has been downloaded from the OAPEN Library. Downloads have been

64

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

chosen as a metric for two reasons. First, readers both within and beyond
universities are able to download books held in the OAPEN Library. This
contrasts to approaches to measuring impact that are based on counting
citations, which only capture a specific form of use by academic readers.
Second, downloads can be measured directly from the OAPEN server. This
ensures a fast, and dependable, result. Although it is not possible to equate
a download with further use (e.g. reading, integration into other work), we
can assume that a much-downloaded online monograph has been read
more often than a book which has been downloaded just a few times. We
cannot, however, state that 100 downloads equate to 100 people reading
the book cover to cover.
While all books in the OAPEN Library are openly available to download
by end users, a significant proportion are also available under libre open
access licenses. These types of licenses allow intermediaries like the DOAB
to aggregate books and display them on a website, which creates another
access point for individual users. This type of aggregation would not be
possible with books available under a more restrictive gratis license.
In this paper, we examine both types of use – by individual end users and
by intermediaries – as we consider the effects of gratis and libre licenses
on the number of times books in the OAPEN Library are downloaded. In
looking at this, we will make two comparisons: first, between gratis and
libre books that were available in the OAPEN Library prior to the creation of the Directory of Open Access Books; and, second, between gratis
books only available in the OAPEN Library and libre books available in
the OAPEN Library and also included in the DOAB. This will allow us to
measure whether libre books are downloaded more often in general, as well
as whether additional aggregation has a significant effect on downloads.
Our guiding research question for this study is:
Compared to gratis access, does applying an open license (libre access)
have a positive effect on the number of times an open access book is
downloaded?
Although the question of license effect is of primary interest, we are
aware that the use of books in the OAPEN Library may also be influenced
by factors other than license type, such as the subject or the language of the
monographs. Earlier research published by (Snijder, 2013b) described the
differences in number of downloads per subject in 2011. It seems reasonable
to assume that subject still affects downloads. We could also argue that
the language of a publication acts as a barrier to use: when readers cannot
understand the language, the books become useless to them. And because

BETTER SH A RING THROUGH LICENSES?

65

of the length of the texts involved, the chances of successful automatic
translation are slim.
The number of times a book is downloaded might reasonably be expected
to reflect the size of a particular language community. Therefore, it is
important to remain alert to the impact of both subject and language on
use when attempting to understand this ecosystem. Regardless of the type
of license applied to a work, and whether or not it is made available in an
aggregation service like the DOAB, prospective readers are not very likely
to download books on subjects that are of no interest to them, or written
in languages they cannot read.
Finally, it may be useful to note that information about the license
for each individual book is always available to the users of the OAPEN
Library website: each page describing a monograph contains a description
of the license. Moreover, information about the complete collection can be
obtained through several data feeds. On top of a description of the books,
all data feeds also list the license information. Within the OAPEN Library,
there is no technical distinction between books with a libre license or a
more restrictive license: each monograph can be searched and downloaded
in the same manner. Differences in usage cannot, therefore, be accounted
for by restrictions in the infrastructure.

Literature review

There are three areas of literature relevant to this study: the conflicting
interests of creators and users; the use of Creative Commons licenses to
balance these interests, and the impact of Creative Commons licenses on
usage.
5.4.1

Tensions between the interests of creators and users

Much of the debate around intellectual property, particularly copyright,
centres on the tensions between creators’ rights and users’ rights. A much
cited example is the paper by (Landes & Posner, 1989), in which they
discuss the optimal level of copyright protection. This entails balancing
the interests of the creators of a work versus the people who want to use
it – either as a ‘reader’ or for creating a derivative work. The conflicting
interest of these stakeholders is also described by (Boldrin & Levine, 2002).
In their analysis, intellectual property law has two components. The first
component is the right to own ideas and sell them. The second component

66

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

is the right to control the use of those ideas after sale. They argue that the
second component – termed “downstream licensing” – leads to monopolies,
impairing economic welfare. Again, we see the need to balance the interests.
Rather than finding a balance in current copyright law, (Suzor, 2014)
argues that in certain cases, a high level of copyright protection is not
needed. According to Suzor, many content users are prepared to pay the
producers, even if the content is freely available. Choosing an intellectual
property model that allows free use, while encouraging – but not enforcing – financial support may both enhance dissemination and compensate
producers.
5.4.2

Balancing interests using Creative Commons licenses

Several authors have discussed the legal context around Creative Commons
Licenses. Loren (2007) criticizes the “climate of overly broad ownership
rights for creative works”, and argues that it hinders the use and reuse of
creative works. The complexity of the current copyright system leads to
high costs, which disadvantages individuals who do not have the same
financial resources as corporations. Broadly applying Creative Commons
licenses helps to create a “semicommons of creative works” (Loren, 2007,
pag. 328), which enables a greater and more diverse usage – to the benefit
of society. This argument closely resembles the removal of legal barriers in
the Berlin Declaration and the Bethesda Statement, describing a right to
access and reuse scholarly and scientific content.
Hietanen (2008) also describes the advent of Creative Commons licenses
as a reaction to the way copyright law has developed. Hietanen discusses
the implications of applying CC licenses in great detail and analyses the
license-choosing process and the clauses of the Creative Commons licenses.
The approach by Kim (2007) is slightly different, and tries to understand the
motives of CC licensors through surveys and interviews. Again, the conflict
of interests of the different stakeholders are debated. However, Kim’s paper
attempts to categorize the types of content licensed under Creative Commons, and the motives of the content owners. The paper describes a large
variety of content types. Furthermore, the reasons to use a CC license vary:
some content owners place emphasis on the public benefits, while others
are motivated by more personal reasons. (Morrison, 2012) discusses the
application of CC licenses within open access publishing. According to
the author, the goals of OA publishing and CC licenses are not aligned. She
concludes that the lack of restrictions of the CC-BY license actually might
be harmful to OA; the absence of restrictions leaves the author or content

BETTER SH A RING THROUGH LICENSES?

67

owner without tools to control its reuse – suggesting that some licenses
may tip the balance too far.
5.4.3

Do Creative Commons licenses enhance usage?

Despite Morrison’s (2012) concerns, other authors arrive at more optimistic
conclusions regarding Creative Commons licenses. (Carroll, 2006) looks at
CC licenses and the changing role of intermediaries. The licenses are made
machine readable, which opens new possibilities for those who enable
all kinds of transactions based on the licensed works. The image sharing
website Flickr.com is a well-known example: it enables end users to find
pictures published under licenses that allow reuse. (Guibault, 2011) discusses
the relation between authors of scientific and scholarly works and copyright
ownership in the European context. She concludes that licensing documents
under Creative Commons (partly) increases access and reuse.
There is little to no research published on the effects of gratis versus libre
open access, especially in the realm of monographs. (J. L. Hilton III, Lutz, &
Wiley, 2012) investigated revisions made to academic textbooks published
under an open license. They conclude that – in line with expectations – the
amount of revisions is relatively low. This is consistent with the findings in
this paper; an open license does not automatically lead to a surge in usage.
As far as could be established, there is no literature available which aims
to quantify variances in usage based on differences in licenses.

5.5

Methods and the data set

The OAPEN Library platform logs usage data, starting from January 2011.
Among the data recorded is the number of times each monograph has
been downloaded in a month. We will use this as an indicator of successful
dissemination: more downloads means a better result. For this paper, we
will analyse the data captured over a period of 33 months: from January
2011 up until September 2013. During this time, 1,734 different books were
made available through the OAPEN Library. Of these monographs, 855
were disseminated as libre open access and 879 were distributed under a
more restrictive regime. Of the 855 libre titles, 512 were published under a
CC-BY-NC-ND licence; the most restrictive open license. In contrast, only
4 titles were available under the CC-BY license. The rest of the titles were
licensed as follows: 162 titles under CC-BY-ND; 168 titles under CC-BY-NC;
and 9 titles under CC-BY-SA.

68

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

The Directory of Open Access Books was launched in April 2012, 16
months after January 2011. To understand whether the DOAB influences
usage, we will compare the data of the first 15 months of the OAPEN Library
to the data of the following 18 months. In the first 15 months, a total of 935
monographs were disseminated via the OAPEN Library; 563 of those under
a libre license. After that period, the collection grew to the 1,734 books, as
described above. The monthly download data for each book is used; if a
book has been available for 33 months, this leads to 33 samples. Of course,
not all books were available during that period, but the total number of
samples used in our analysis is over 34,000.
Table 1 lists the number of books that were made available in the OAPEN
Library, split by period and license. In the period before the launch of the
Directory of Open Access Books, the difference in usage is not very large:
on average, books published under a libre license were downloaded 29
times per month, compared to 21 times per month for books with gratis
licenses. However, in the period after the DOAB launch, the difference
widens to 84 downloads versus 34 downloads on average per month.
It seems reasonable to assume that the aggregation in the DOAB has a
positive influence.

The OAPEN Library contains books on many subjects; our dataset contains 96 different subject classifications. Nevertheless, not all subjects are
equally spread among the collection. Among the most common subjects
we find Politics & Government and History. When looking at the licenses
used, it becomes clear that they are not evenly spread: for instance, 22%
of the books on Politics & government are published under a libre license,
compared to 61% of books on History. Table 2 contains a more comprehensive listing.

The collection contains monographs in several languages. Most are written in English, Dutch, German or Italian, but also books in Danish, Latin or
Russian are made available. As is the case with subject, the portion of books
published under a libre license varies strongly per language; while 57% of
books in English can be downloaded using a libre license, the percentage for
Dutch is much lower: 13%. Table 3 lists the number of books per language.

Analysis

Our analysis starts with measuring the effect of four factors – license, DOAB
aggregation, subject, and language – on usage. This helps to determine if all
factors indeed affect the number of downloads in the OAPEN Library. If one
or more of them is not relevant, it can be discarded from our analysis. The
one-way independent ANOVA statistical method is used to check whether
each influence has a statistically significant effect. This procedure tests if
the differences between the mean downloads of the books can be explained
by chance. The results of each individual test are summarized in Table 4.

downloads, F(4, 10528.836) = 248.871, p < .001, ω2 = 0.01
Results: The assumption of homogeneity of variance has been violated; therefore, the
Welch F-ratio is reported.

When a statistically significant effect has been measured, the differences
between the analysed groups is bigger than can be expected by chance.
However, in large groups this will happen more often; our data set contains
over 34,000 samples. The height of the F-ratio indicates the effect size: a
higher ratio indicates a stronger effect of the experiment – in our case:
license; aggregation through the DOAB; subject and language. Furthermore,
the ω2 value describes the proportion of the variance between the two
groups. If the value of ω2 is 0.01, this means that approximately 1% of the
difference in downloads can be attributed to the effect investigated.
The results show that usage of the OAPEN Library is not only influenced
by license; it is also affected by DOAB aggregation, subject and language.
This complicates the goal of identifying the specific influence of license
type. A common way to proceed is to use the multifactor ANOVA procedure
to measure the effect of license, combined with the impact of DOAB aggregation, subject and language. Nevertheless, in order to get meaningful
results from this procedure, several requirements must be met. The most
important precondition is the homogeneity of variance. In other words, the

BETTER SH A RING THROUGH LICENSES?

71

means used in the procedure should be evenly distributed. Unfortunately,
our data does not meet this condition. As a possible solution to overcome
the statistical problems, the data is split into smaller subsets.
We have seen before that the usage in the period before the DOAB launch
is strongly different from the usage patterns in the period after the launch.
To compensate for this, the data is split in two sets: the usage statistics generated in the period before the launch of the directory – January 2011-March
2012 – and the number of downloads registered in the period when DOAB
aggregation was deployed – April 2012-September 2013. The groups to be
analysed share the same subject or the same language, and the data was
gathered in the same period. So, for instance, the usage of all books with
the subject Politics & government in the period before the launch of the
DOAB – January 2011-March 2012 – is analysed to see whether the license
has a significant influence. Splitting up the data creates smaller subsets; but
even the smallest group – Sociology & anthropology, in the period January
2011-March 2012 – contains 415 samples.
The analysis focuses on the impact of licensing on direct use (usage preDOAB launch), and on the impact of licensing on direct use and aggregated
use (usage post-DOAB launch). When we look at use prior to the launch of
the DOAB, we expect that simply using libre licenses will have a positive
effect on the number of times books are downloaded by readers. When we
examine use after the launch of the Directory of Open Access Books, the
role of a libre-enabled intermediary in providing an additional access point
is analysed. With regard to aggregators like the DOAB, it is expected that
libre licenses will enhance the number of downloaded books indirectly--by
facilitating additional access points which stimulate readers to find and
download books.
As we have seen, the results are not only affected by the license used;
the effects of subject and language also play a prominent role. The effects
of language and subject are not straightforward: whether or not a certain
language or subject enhances or diminishes the number of books downloaded is hard to predict. In contrast, the use of a libre license is directly
aimed at removing barriers to usage. The impact of subject and language
can be seen in the analysis below in that the influence of licenses varies per
dataset. However, the overall picture is clear: the use of libre licenses alone
has a limited impact on downloads, while aggregating libre-licensed books
has a positive effect on the number of books downloaded.

Impact of licensing on OAPEN downloads

5.6.1.1 Subjects and license
Here, the difference in mean number of downloaded books is examined
between libre and gratis books that share the same subject. This analysis
only includes usage prior to the launch of the DOAB. The results are mixed:
for the books on History or the books on Society & culture, the license
has no effect on the number of books downloaded. However, for the other
subsets, the differences in mean number of downloaded books is statistically significant.
Even where there is a significant difference, the effects of publishing
under an open license are not very large. Before, we discussed the F-ratio
and the ω2 value as an indication of the impact. If we look at these numbers,
it becomes clear that the effect of libre licenses for books on Economics is
much smaller compared to the other subsets. Also, the ω2 value is never
higher than 0.02. In other words: libre licenses do not always lead to a
difference on the number of books downloaded; when such a difference
is found, the influence of licences is much smaller for books on Economics
and for other groups the measured impact is no more than approximately
2%.

5.6.1.2 Languages and license
Here we follow the same procedure: the data is split into groups with the
same language in order to create groups with equal attributes. The data in
Table 6 was captured before launching the DOAB.
Again we see that license type does not create a statistically significant
difference in all groups, and that both the F-ratio and the ω2 value are
relatively low in the groups where a statistically significant difference is
found. The maximum ω2 value is even lower compared to the analysis on
subject: it is 0.01. In other words, the biggest measured impact of licenses
is approximately 1%. Moreover, the books written in Italian and other
languages – where no significant statistical differences were found – show
a different download pattern: the mean downloads of books with a libre
license is lower compared to the group of gratis titles.

5.6.1.3 Conclusion on the impact of licenses on downloads
From a statistical point of view, the number of downloaded books is sometimes positively affected by open licenses. However, we have also seen that
if there is a positive effect, it is very small. Furthermore, not all groups of
books are affected by the license. If the books are grouped by subject, for
the titles on History and the books Society & culture – 21% of all titles – the
difference in number of books downloaded is not caused by the license.
When the books are grouped by language, we see a statistically significant
effect for monographs written in English and Dutch – almost 70% of all
titles – with an associated ω2 value of 0.00. An effect of approximately zero
percent is not very large.

75

BETTER SH A RING THROUGH LICENSES?

We can conclude that the impact of libre licenses is limited – the download behaviour of users of the OAPEN Library is not affected in any practical
way by the type of license used. However, in the next section we will see
that libre-enabled aggregation through an intermediary has a much bigger
effect on usage.
5.6.2

Impact of license-enabled aggregation on OAPEN Downloads

5.6.2.1 Subjects and aggregation
When we look at the download data for the period after the launch of the
DOAB, the results are quite different. Compared to their gratis counterparts,
each group of monographs published under a libre license and so listed in
the DOAB is downloaded more. Here, the mean number of downloads of
books under a libre license is almost twice as high compared to gratis titles.
In the previous data set, the difference is closer to 25%.
In addition, not only are the differences in mean downloads larger, but
the statistical effects are also more profound. First, the F-ratios – defining
the size of the effect we are measuring – are much higher compared to the
data set listed in Table 5. Also, the values of ω2 are much bigger. In the case
of Sociology & anthropology it is 0.17; about 17% of the difference could be
explained by the libre license and the subsequent aggregation through the
Directory of Open Access Books. Table 7 lists the data of the monographs
grouped by subject.

Languages and aggregation
When the titles are grouped by language, the statistical effects of a libre
license leading to aggregation by the DOAB are also visible. Most interesting
are the differences in F-ratios and ω2 values between the different language
groups. While the libre titles written in Dutch and the titles written in
“Other languages” clearly benef it from the aggregation, the effects on
books in English and German are less noticeable. Still, the findings are
statistically significant, and another metric is also clearly pointing in the
same direction. If only direct usage is analysed – the data in Table 6 – the
difference between mean number of downloads of books on a gratis licence
is small; the average amount of downloaded gratis books is almost as high
as the mean number of downloads of books on a libre license. However, the
data in Table 8 depicts a much larger difference. Here, the mean number
of downloads of libre books is almost twice the amount for gratis books.

5.6.2.2 Conclusions on the impact of license-enabled aggregation on
downloads
In contrast to the download activity prior to the launch of the Directory of
Open Access Books, there is a statistically significant effect on all subsets:
the use of an open licence, which allows the creation of an additional access
point through the DOAB, has a positive effect on the number of books
downloaded. The influence of aggregation clearly makes a difference. The
most positive statistical effects are found within the subset “Sociology &
anthropology” – where approximately 17% of the difference can be explained by open licensing and the subset “Politics & government” and the
subset “Society & culture: general” – here approximately 12 % is measured.
However, not all results are so unambiguous, especially for the subsets
on language. For instance, while a positive influence has been measured,
the value of ω2 for books in English is just 0.01. On the other hand, the mean

78

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

number of downloaded English language books on a gratis license is less
than half the mean number of books on a libre license.
We can conclude that the use of libre licenses has a positive effect when
we look at the effect of aggregation on downloads. Although the licenses do
not directly affect the readers’ behaviour, libre licences enable additional
services by intermediaries like the Directory of Open Access Books. These
additional services lead to increases in the number of books downloaded.

5.7

Discussion

The notion that libre material will be more used compared to gratis works
seems highly obvious: an open license removes a barrier to usage. On the
other hand, if the gratis works are made available under the same technical
conditions as their libre counterparts, most users would make no distinction
and treat the works as ‘free as in beer’. In the case of the OAPEN Library,
its description of licenses states the following: “If not stated otherwise,
all works in the OAPEN Online Library fall under the OAPEN Deposit
License – all rights reserved. End users are allowed to read the work online,
download, print and copy it for their own personal purposes within the
legal framework of their national copyright law. Beyond this all rights are
reserved.”15 In other words, the site clears legal obstacles for readers who
want to use the books for personal reasons, and in this context it is not
surprising that libre licenses did not play a large role in the period before
the launch of the DOAB (January 2011-March 2012).
We have seen that each of the four discussed influences – libre versus
gratis licenses; additional aggregation; subject and language – all affect the
usage of the books in the OAPEN Library. By looking at the period before
the extra coverage provided by the Directory of Open Access Books could
play a role, a possible influence is removed from the analysis. As a second
restriction, the usage data is split among subjects or languages. Within some
of these subsets, the libre license positively affects usage, while in other
subsets the effect could not be measured. However, even if a statistically
significant result has been found, the effect size was negligible. The biggest
measured impact of licenses found in the analysis of the subject subsets
is approximately 2%. If languages are examined, almost 70% of all titles
listed an effect of approximately zero percent. These results refute the
claim by Guibault (2011) that open licenses enhance usage. However, in this
15 http://oapen.org/about?page=support&subpage=forreaders

BETTER SH A RING THROUGH LICENSES?

79

particular case, the legal restrictions toward books with a more restrictive
license are relatively slight.
Combining libre licenses and aggregation in the DOAB has a far more
profound effect. When the data of that period is split in subsets based on
subject or language the difference is clear. In each subset, the books with a
libre license are downloaded more; the additional access provided through
the DOAB appears to result in more successful dissemination of the books.
This is also seen in the ratio between the mean number of downloads before
and after the deployment of the DOAB. Taking into account all the average
downloads in the subject subset reveals that in the pre-DOAB period, the
number of downloads for books with a gratis license is 72% of the amount
associated with books published under a libre license. After the launch of
the DOAB, this percentage plummets to 43%. The same holds true in the
language subset, where the percentages are 91% and 54%, respectively. This
is another indication that extra aggregation has a positive impact on usage.

5.8

Conclusion

As far as could be established, this is the first paper to measure the effects
of libre licenses on the use of open access monographs. Most of the literature
on open licenses discuss them from a legal perspective, and focus on their
innovations in relation to copyright. Also, open access publishing as a means
to optimize the dissemination of scholarly and scientific information is
mostly absent from the articles cited. However, the underlying theme –
ownership and control over creative works and its economic aspects – does
of course play an important role in the OA debate. Enforcing restrictions
based on copyright laws creates another barrier to access, or to certain
types of reuse.
Both the open access movement and the Creative Commons organization
strive to maximise the use of creative works. While they share the goal of
removing legal barriers to use or reuse, there is disagreement about the
optimal license for open content. The Creative Commons organization
chooses a flexible approach, by offering six different choices. In contrast,
within the open access movement, there is a strong preference for the CC-BY
license.
The current collection of the OAPEN Library does not completely
conform to the recommendations of either group. Roughly half of the collection is made available under a gratis license that only permits personal
use, which is more limited than the most restricted Creative Commons

80

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

license. Nevertheless, when considering direct use only (pre-DOAB launch
downloads), the books under a gratis license perform just as well as the libre
titles. In this context, the impact of licenses is limited.
However, when examining the use of OAPEN Library books after the
launch of the DOAB, which automatically imports metadata of all books
with a libre license, a benefit of libre licenses becomes clear. As Carroll
(2006) predicted, machine readable metadata on licenses was used to
perform a service; in this case inserting the OAPEN titles into the DOAB
discovery service. Doing so proved to be successful: the titles featured in
the DOAB are downloaded from the OAPEN Library more compared to
books which do not receive the extra attention.
To a certain extent, the decision to include libre-licensed OAPEN titles
in the Directory of Open Access Books – leading to additional visibility on
another platform – has been a DOAB policy decision, and was not inherently
dependent on license type. However, the machine readable libre licenses
that enable aggregators such as the DOAB to identify and add licensed
content can also lead to other types of reuse. For example, Biomed Central
offers text mining services based on a collection of articles with a “BioMed
Central open access license agreement”. According to BioMed Central, this
license is identical to the Creative Commons Attribution License (BioMed
Central Ltd., 2014).
Whether through simple aggregation or more intensive reuse like textual
analysis, it appears that libre licenses do have the potential to positively
affect usage. Rather than directly appealing to end users of individual
books, these licenses enable intermediaries to create new services built on
collections of open content. These services, in turn, can help to increase
the impact of the individual publications.

5.9

Limitations

In the data set used for this paper, each book’s license was described in
two ways: Creative Commons or no Creative Commons. It did not take
into account the six different licenses in several versions – 2.0, 2.5 and
3.0 – that have been used in the examined collection. Some of the books
were published under the UK or German version, while most were published
under the ‘international’ version. It may be possible that the readers of the
OAPEN Library were aware of all the legal details, and this influence has
not been taken into account. The metadata of the books – available at http://

BETTER SH A RING THROUGH LICENSES?

81

persistent-identifier.nl/?identifier=urn:nbn:nl:ui:13-8ut1-25 – contains the
license of each individual title.
In the statistical analysis, is has been assumed that the choice for
publishing a book under a gratis or a libre licence has not been biased.
The influence of license on the behaviour of readers has of course been
extensively discussed.

Patterns of information : Clustering
books and readers in open access
libraries

6.1

Introduction

Open access libraries operate in a continuum between two distinct organisation models: online retailers versus ‘traditional’ libraries. Online retailers
such as Amazon.com are successful in recommending additional items
that match the specific needs of their customers. The success rate of the
recommendation depends on knowledge of the individual customer: more
knowledge about persons leads to better suggestions. Thus, to optimally
profit from the retailers’ offerings, the client must be prepared to share
personal information, leading to the question of privacy.
In contrast, protection of privacy is a core value for libraries. The question
is how open access libraries can offer comparable services while retaining
the readers’ privacy. A possible solution can be found in analysing the preferences of groups of like-minded people: communities. According to Lynch
(2002), digital libraries are bad at identifying or predicting the communities
that will use their collections. It is however our intention to explore the
possibility to uncover sets of documents with a meaningful connection for
groups of readers – the communities. The solution depends on examining
patterns of usage, instead of storing information about individual readers.
This paper will investigate the possibility to uncover the preferences of
user groups within an open access digital library using social networking
analysis techniques.

6.2

Background

Recommender systems are powerful tools, whose design poses privacy
issues. The role of privacy in the library landscape is discussed, along with
the use of recommendation systems in libraries. If it is not feasible to match
titles to individuals, the use of clustering techniques might mitigate some

84

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

of the privacy problems while still creating relevant sets of titles. In turn,
these sets may be used in recommendation services.
6.2.1

Recommender systems

Recommender systems can be defined as tools that provide suggestions
about items that may prove valuable to a user (Linden, Smith, & York, 2003;
Pazzani & Billsus, 2007; Ricci, Rokach, Shapira, & Kantor, 2011; Schafer,
Konstan, & Riedl, 1999). The prediction is based on processing data about
items, users and transactions. Items are the objects to be recommended; in
the case of digital libraries this would be documents. Understanding users
is a critical part of recommender systems; ultimately, their success is based
on how well they know the user’s needs and preferences. Needless to say,
this poses privacy issues. Transactions are defined as a recorded interaction
between a user and the recommender system.
Recommender systems are based on several techniques. The first type
of system is content based, in which recommendations are based on items
that are similar to those used in the past. Another type of recommender
system is based on the demographic profile of the user. A third kind deploys
specific domain knowledge: what aspects of items are the most useful in
a particular environment? Community based systems use recommendations of the user’s friends. Finally, hybrid systems combine several of the
discussed techniques. The common factor is creating an extensive profile of
users at the level of the individual not limited to their personal preferences,
and including data about their peers. Furthermore, this profile is updated
over time to keep abreast of changing preferences. From a privacy point of
view, this leads to the question of trust: how much personal information
should such a system contain?
Trust in recommender systems has been investigated by Chellappa &
Sin (2005), from a slightly different angle: under what conditions are people
willing to allow vendors to store personal information? They conclude that
people are prepared to share information if the vendor is able to invoke
trust. The level of trust invoked by a specific vendor is a reason for consumers to shop there, and ignore others with virtually the same offering. Even
while people feel a general concern about sharing private data in general,
they might be willing to give up some of their privacy in return for benefits
provided by the vendor.
Not everybody will be trading privacy for convenience, and Jeckmans
et al. (2013) have investigated possible remedies, such as raising awareness
about privacy issues and invoking specific laws dealing with personal

PATTER NS OF INFOR M ATION

85

information. These types of measures have serious drawbacks. As we have
seen, being aware does not stop people to engage with recommender
systems and most legislation will take quite some time before coming into
effect. The authors also describe technical measures such as anonymization,
randomization and the use of cryptography. If user data is anonymized, the
identifying information is removed, while preserving the rest. Randomization and differential privacy techniques aim to make the data of a specific
person indistinguishable from most other users, by adding random data.
Cryptography is considered to be a more secure choice, but with additional
costs: it requires extra resources and may slow down the system.
These techniques add extra complexity to the system. This raises a question for the system’s owner that mirrors the privacy trade-off by customers.
Improved privacy protection will most likely have a negative effect on the
system’s efficiency, reducing the likelihood of implementation.
6.2.2

Libraries, privacy and the role of the catalogue

Global library cooperative OCLC lists at the time of writing 139 web based
collections of open access documents (OCLC, 2016). All these collections
fall within the definitions of digital libraries as discussed by Borgman
(1999): a combination of “content collected on behalf of user communities”,
which also functions as an “institution or service”. So, when a digital library
collects and maintains a collection of documents in order to serve the
information needs of specific groups of users, it functions as a ‘traditional’
library.
If open access libraries share traits with traditional libraries, we might
also expect the same attitude towards privacy. The privacy of library patrons
must be protected, including user data collected in library systems. This
position is shared among the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (2016), the American Library Association (2014) and
several other national library associations..
Protecting library patron’s privacy is not an easy task. American libraries
struggle with the implication of the USA PATRIOT Act, which expand the
abilities of law enforcement agencies to collect personal information (Jaeger,
McClure, Bertot, & Snead, 2004). The gathering of this type of data is not
limited to the United States, but is also becoming more common in European countries (Nijboer, 2004). Apart from governmental organisations,
libraries might also develop policies about other third parties who might
be interested in the data generated by – and about – users (Corrado, 2007).
Some libraries try to resolve the trade-off between extra functionalities and

86

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

better service versus protecting personal information by adding recommender functions to their online public access catalogue (OPAC), based on
anonymised usage data (Geyer-Schulz, Neumann, & Thede, 2003; Mönnich
& Spiering, 2008).
Whether a ‘anonymized’ OPAC is a fitting solution for open access libraries can be called into question. Firstly, the role of the catalogue as primary
entrance to the collection is being re-evaluated, as illustrated by Dempsey
(2006). He argues that library catalogues are too limited as tools to discover
content. This is put into practice at the library of Utrecht University, through
the deprecation of their OPAC system. Instead, relevant results must come
from search engines and library aggregators (Kortekaas & Kramer, 2014).
Others are discussing whether social media websites such as Facebook.com
offer an alternative. Scale (2008) concludes that Facebook does not deliver
optimal results, but the article’s number of citations indicates the interest
in the library community. Secondly, compared to ‘traditional’ libraries,
open access libraries – which are by definition online – might even be
more depending on search engines or other external discovery tools. This
is illustrated by the OAPEN Library. Its website functions as an OPAC;
however, over 70% of its usage bypasses the website. The documents are
accessed by enabling integration into the user’s systems, the infrastructure
used on a daily basis (Snijder, 2014a).
In short, privacy should be a concern for open access libraries and the
OPAC – even when it does not retain reader data – might not be the best
solution for content discovery.
6.2.3

Clustering books and readers through social network analysis?

The previous sections made clear that recommendation systems only function well at the cost of privacy. In a library context, this is not acceptable
and the offered solutions are not ideal, especially in the case of open access
libraries. This leads to the central question to discuss in this paper: how
to support library users in an environment that minimizes the amount of
information stored about individuals?
When it is not feasible to create profiles of individuals, we might look
at the combined behaviour of all users of the digital library. Are all books
downloaded at random, or can we discern clusters of books that are meaningful for groups of readers? The clustered books can be seen as a network of
interconnected objects. If it is possible to identify such networks, it might be
possible to recommend relevant books based on usage patterns. We might
go a step further, and examine if the groups of individuals connected to

PATTER NS OF INFOR M ATION

87

those book clusters share a common trait. Thus, we are examining possible
networks of books and readers.
How can we study such networks? Open access libraries do not register
individual users, but a small amount of – publicly available – information
about the internet provider can be used. Typically, the usage amounts to
thousands of document downloads, where the provider and the document
can be linked. In other words, the provider acts as a proxy for the reader. A
certain document can be linked to multiple providers and one provider may
be connected to multiple documents. These kinds of relations are studied
using social network analysis techniques. Using graph – or network – theory,
the characteristics of networks can be described and examined. Which
aspects of the nodes – the parts – and the edges – the relations between
the nodes – are most relevant depend on the characteristics of the network.
The possible combinations of providers and titles are quite large and thus,
finding meaningful clusters is not easy. The same problem – at much larger
scale – can also be found on the web. Kumar, et al. (1999) deployed graph
theory to find “implicitly defined communities” using sets of interlinked
Web pages. They aimed to find groups of content creators sharing a common
interest. According to the authors, those groups could provide valuable
information resources for interested users, uncover some of the sociology of
the Web and target advertising. This aligns with the role of online libraries:
providing valuable information to interested parties and directing them to
the right documents is a core task. Finding communities in digital libraries
is the first step to recommending useful content; not to individuals but to
groups.
The extensive introduction into social network analysis by Wasserman
& Faust (1994) can be used to define the type of network under examination. In this case, the network consists of two types of groups or modes:
providers and documents. These types of networks are called two mode
networks. Furthermore, the relation between the providers and the books
is not reciprocated: providers act on books, but – for the purpose of this
paper – books are not acting on the providers. Consequently, this two-mode
network is directed.
Moreover, networks consisting of actors and passive elements such as
social events – or in this case: documents – are called an affiliation or
membership network. Here, the analysis is based on affiliations of actors
to the passive elements, on the relation between the passive elements and
the actors, or on both modes simultaneously. One possible analysis of the
latter kind is finding cohesive subsets of actors and passive elements. In
this case, clusters of providers and books.

88

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

The solution to the problem of f inding communities in networks is
described by Newman and Girvan (2004). By repeatedly using an algorithm
that removes edges that acts as a ‘bridge’ between others, all the nodes
are divided into closely connected groups. Wakita & Tsurumi (2007) have
created an updated version, which is used for the research in this paper.
The use of social network analysis or clustering algorithms is not limited
to the discovery of user groups. For instance, Verleysen & Weeren (2016) used
a “fuzzy cluster analysis” to examine the divide between authors publishing
in international journals in English, compared to those writing books and
chapters in national or regional languages. Their results are supported by
computer generated outputs. In contrast, Provan, et al. (2005) encourage
community leaders to use social network analysis procedures to manually
describe the networks they participate in. These approaches demonstrate
the breadth of social network analysis.
The procedure outlined in this paper should be relevant to all kinds of
digital open access libraries, leading to some additional requirements. First,
it must be applicable to a wide variety of collections. Therefore, the metadata
used has to be attainable from different types of documents. The metadata
used will be discussed further in section 6.3.2 The books. Secondly, the tools
to be used ought to be available as open source software, preferably with
an easy to use interface. This paper’s analysis has been conducted using
NodeXL, a free and open source network analysis tool using a Microsoft
Excel template. It is maintained by the Social Media Research Foundation,
co-founded by Marc Smith (Shneiderman & Dunne, 2013).

6.3

Quantifying the data set

The previous section discussed the tension between privacy and optimizing
recommendation systems. Using social network analysis to find communities around certain books might enable open access libraries to create
recommendations, while retaining the privacy of the individual readers.
In order to test this idea, the usage of the OAPEN library will be analysed.
6.3.1

The collection

The OAPEN Library is managed by the OAPEN Foundation, a not-for-profit
organisation based in the Netherlands. The Foundation’s goal is to promote open access book publishing, through building and disseminating
a quality-controlled collection of open access books (OAPEN Foundation,

PATTER NS OF INFOR M ATION

89

2016). The books discuss a broad range of subjects, and are written in several
languages. Around half the publications are written in English; both Dutch
and German amount to roughly 20% and 5% of the books are Italian. Other
languages include French, Danish, Spanish and Latin. Section 6.3.2 The books
describes the state of the collection in 2012.
As stated before, our goal is to find clusters of books and providers that
have a meaningful connection. In other words, we need to establish whether
a combination can be attributed to an underlying theme, and not determined by chance. This procedure must be transparent and reproducible in
other collections than the one currently under examination. The method
used is based on quantifying several aspects of the total collection. These
numbers are compared to the amounts measured in the clusters.
The data describing the complete collection of 2012 and 2014 is available
in the appendix. It will be used as benchmark. The data of the clusters
described in section 6.4.1 and section 6.4.3 is also listed there. The appendix,
the underlying lists of downloads, providers and the clusters they occupy
are available via http://dx.doi.org/10.17026/dans-x72-d9h2.
6.3.2

The books

The clusters contain books and providers; the first step is to determine
which aspects will be examined. Starting with books, the number of
possible aspects is large. The books are collected and maintained by the
owner of the digital library, who might choose to describe the documents
in many different ways. A typical book description in a library catalogue
contains the title, author, publisher, place and year of publication, number
of pages, ISBN, language, whether it is part of a series, and indications of
the book’s subject through keywords and classification codes. However,
these descriptions serve several purposes: some are useful to identify a
work, while others may help to indicate the book’s topic and its quality or
prestige. In this case, we assume that the users of the electronic library are
interested in books “about” a subject.
In general, the contents of a scholarly book will not be limited to one
subject. Even if the authors are exploring one theme, the book will discuss
several facets. An example is the book “Malaysian Cinema, Asian Film:
Border Crossings and National Culture”.1 This book might be useful for
those who are interested in film and media studies, but also for those who
are involved in the culture of Malaysia or Southeast Asia.

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Another aspect to consider in a web-based collection is language. Open
access libraries are open to everyone with an internet collection; a potential
worldwide audience. However, it is unlikely that prospective readers will
download books in languages they cannot understand.
The most widely used methods to describe the contents of document are
keywords and classifications. Keywords are potentially more accurate, but
the endless possibilities make it hard to create quantifiable sets. In contrast,
classifications are based on a hierarchy. By selecting the top levels, it is
possible to create relatively few sets of books.
Compared to keywords, the possible number of languages is lower. A
large variation in languages is not always useful in an analysis. For instance,
there is no point in listing Swedish as a separate language if a collection of
thousands of titles contains three books in Swedish. Thus, the quantification is based on a simplification of the available metadata.
For the analysis, each book in the collection was categorised as follows:
it belongs to one language set, and it may contain up to five subject codes.
These two aspects can be placed in a matrix, serving as a ‘snapshot’ of
the collection in a certain point of time. Such a matrix is quite useful in
displaying every possible detail, and helps to quantify the amount of titles
in a certain language or subject. Still, a visualisation is a more optimal
way to display the main characteristics of the collection. For instance, the
large percentage of documents on society and social sciences or humanities
and the amount of English language books are easily spotted in Figure 1.
Other details – such as the large percentage of German language books on
law – are also visible.

The providers

In contrast to books, the amount of information about providers is limited.
When users are not tracked, there is little more available than the name of
the provider and the time when a specific book was downloaded. Identifying individual readers is next to impossible: a feature that protects the
reader’s privacy. Using public information – based on the WHOIS internet
protocol (Daigle, 2004) – the provider’s country of origin is also available.
Thus, using the provider as proxy, readers can be grouped by nation. This
method is not 100% accurate: when a Dutch native travels through Canada
and accesses a book using a Canadian internet provider, this will be listed
as a “Canadian” download.
Logging internet providers leads to another interesting question: how
many people have downloaded books through that provider, and are they
interested in the same things? If the provider is an organisation with a strict
focus, chances are that all members share a similar interest. An example is
the organisation Bouwkennis – a Dutch marketing firm, specializing on the
building sector, which downloaded a report on housing policy. In contrast,
also listed among the downloading companies is Verizon, a large internet
service provider serving millions of customers. It is highly unlikely that all

92

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

documents downloaded through Verizon are the result of a single person
or a ‘single minded’ group. Another complication is the freedom of users
of an online open access library to download as many titles as they like.
The question is how to select download patterns that are the result of
a single person’s action, or the action of a goal-oriented organisation. The
number of titles downloaded by a provider should not be the deciding factor.
On the contrary, we might imagine several readers who are interested in the
same twelve books: the kind of pattern that hints at a shared interest. On
the other hand, we need to filter out the actions of a diffuse group of people
who only happen to share the same internet provider. The solution chosen
here is to look at the number of times a single title is downloaded through a
provider. The number of downloads are logged per month. To be absolutely
sure that a single person has downloaded a title, multiple downloads of the
same title by the same provider in one month are discarded. All downloads
where just one copy of different titles is downloaded by a single provider
are still part of the data. Besides, if the provider downloads the same title
in another month, this download will also be part of the analysed data.
How does this choice effect the data? The download data for 2012 – collected during three months – consists of 6,176 providers who downloaded
57,508 books. After removing those providers that have downloaded the same
title more than once in the same month, the number of providers becomes
5,180 (84% of 6,176) and the number of books downloaded is 34,345 (60%
of 57,508). The majority (53%) of the 5,180 providers downloaded a single
title; amounting to 2,740 providers. The remaining 47% (2,440 providers)
downloaded between two and 338 different titles. Examining the number of
providers that download more than one book demonstrates that the majority
of that group (1,440 providers) never ‘take’ more than five books. This is
consistent with the assumption that we are looking at individuals that search
for specific titles, instead of those who are downloading as much as possible.
The ratio of nationalities is next to be examined. The percentages of all
visitors of the online library can be used as a benchmark to compare against
the clusters. A cluster containing a considerable difference in nationalities
combined with a substantial difference in the range of subjects might signal
that the books and providers have a meaningful connection. To enable this,
we need to list the nationalities of all providers. However, the data contains
over 160 different countries, ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe. The goal is
to find significant differences, not a complete list. Therefore, the benchmark
can be simplified to the ten countries with the highest usage. When the
‘top-10’ of a cluster contains countries not in listed in the benchmark, this
is a clear – and easy to detect – signal.

The influence of the collection

The previous sections discussed the choices made to quantify the most useful aspects of the publications in the collection, and its users. These aspects
are used to analyse how the readers – through the providers – interact with
the books in the digital library. In other words: the collection shapes the
possible actions of the readers. This leads to the question whether changes
in the collection lead to changes in usage. To test this, the same investigation
is carried out using data from 2014, two years after the first analysis. During
that period, the collection of the OAPEN Library doubled from just over
1,100 titles to more than 2,300 titles. This growth influenced the collection
on both axes: subject and language.
The growth of the collection altered the ranking of the subject categories
and the languages. In 2012 “A - The arts” ranked third and “K - Economics,
finance, business & management” ranked fourth. In 2014, this was reversed.
The same holds true for “P - Mathematics & science” – ranked sixth in
2012 and seventh in 2014 – and “D - Literature & literary studies” – ranked
seventh in 2012 and sixth in 2014. Within the languages, the ranking of
Danish changed from fifth to seventh. Furthermore, due to the influx of
titles in English, German and Dutch, the percentage of Italian language
titles plummeted from 11% in 2012 to 5% in 2014.
The differences between 2012 and 2014 indicate that the focus of the
collection may have shifted. Does this also lead to differences in usage?

Analysis

The previous section discussed the way the book and provider data was
quantified: what aspects are to be examined? Furthermore, the collection
of the OAPEN Library has expanded extensively, which also affects the
usage. In this section, the analysis of the collection’s usage in 2012 and 2014
are presented, exposing the difference in download patterns.
6.4.1

Examining clusters – the OAPEN collection in 2012

The first step towards answering the questions discussed in the previous
sections is examining the usage patterns that occurred in 2012. In section 6.4.3, book downloads in 2014 are examined and the differences will
be discussed. During the examined period – lasting three months – 967

94

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

different titles were downloaded by 5,180 providers. The total number of
downloads is 34,345.
Figure 2 Clustered providers and books in the OAPEN Library, 2012

The linked titles and providers are clustered using the Wakita-Tsurumi
(2007) algorithm, resulting in 43 clusters ranging in size from 1,000 elements (125 books and 875 providers) to a cluster consisting of exactly one
book and one provider. And so we need to consider the number of clusters
to investigate. At what point is the cluster too small to convey meaningful results? As this kind of study is scarce, there are no tried and tested
guidelines. This paper’s result might be considered to be a proof of concept,
where the additional question of the optimal number of clusters is ignored
for now. Instead, the – somewhat arbitrary – boundary is set at the ten
largest clusters.
It must be noted that the data used in the Wakita-Tsurumi algorithm
consists of nothing more than a unique code for each book, and the name
of the provider. For instance, the connections between “uni-mannheim.
de” and “422333”; “uni-mannheim.de” and “391039” are part of the data.
After deploying the algorithm, the provider “uni-mannheim.de” is classified
as German, and the books are identified as Vernetztes Leben. Soziale und
digitale Kulturen and The Practices of Happiness : Political Economy, Religion
and Wellbeing. Thus, the algorithm cannot be influenced by aspects of the
providers or the books.
The data of each cluster has been analysed based on the following procedure. Firstly, the ranked subject classifications and the languages of the
books in each cluster are compared to the complete collections’ data. The

95

PATTER NS OF INFOR M ATION

second question is whether the cluster’s providers division in nationalities
are in line with the percentages for the complete set. Substantial changes
trigger a further examination of the book’s subject by assessing keywords
and titles.
The analysis resulted in the following ‘named clusters’:
• Cluster 1. German language books. Books in the German language, mostly
downloaded by readers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
• Cluster 2. Dutch language books. Books in the Dutch language, mostly
downloaded by readers from The Netherlands and Belgium.
• Cluster 3. Italian language books. A majority of the books is written in
the Italian language, mostly downloaded by readers from Italy.
• Cluster 5. Film and Media. Books in the English language. The cluster
contains a large group of books discussing film studies, plus a few titles
on media or theatre studies.
• Cluster 6. Migration. Books in the English language, focused on migration
studies.
• Cluster 9. Indonesia and South-East Asia. Books in the English language,
mostly discussing Indonesia, in combination with works on South East
Asia.

The role of nationality and language is visible in the largest clusters. The
first cluster contains 125 books, and 122 of those titles are in the German
language. Also, the ‘top 3’ nationalities of the providers are German speaking countries. The same holds true for the second cluster, which consists
of a large majority of Dutch language monographs. Here, the Dutch and
Belgian providers rank one and two, respectively. And the third cluster is
dominated by Italian languages monographs and Italian providers. Within
these clusters, the ranking of the subjects seems to reflect the division of
the books in the respective language. For instance, in Cluster 1, Law ranks
first. The explanation can be found in the relative large number of law titles
in the German language.
Within the cluster on Film and Media, English plays a major role. As is
the case with Cluster 6 and Cluster 9, the USA providers are now ranked at
the first place. In these three clusters, subject plays a major role. This can be
inferred from the differences between the classification within the clusters
compared to the whole collection, and an examination of the keywords and

PATTER NS OF INFOR M ATION

97

titles of the books. We might conclude that the role of English is different
from German, Dutch or Italian: it is not a defining property of a cluster.
In the case of Cluster 9 – Indonesia and South-East Asia – the interest
through Indonesian and Austrian providers can easily be explained by a
regional focus. In contrast, the international usage of the clusters on Film
and Media or Migration do not show such a clear pattern. In the case of
Cluster 6 – Migration – the spread of providers is relatively even: there are no
countries with a much stronger interest compared to the other ‘members’ of
the cluster. It is noteworthy however, that the “providers top 10” lists Spain,
Greece, Austria and Hungary. All of these countries are not part of the total
collection’s top 10. Yet, in these countries – and also in France, Poland and
Germany – immigration is a widely-debated topic. This might point to a
regional interest, but the signal is not as strong compared to the data by
Cluster 9. See the Appendix for more details.
6.4.3

Examining clusters – the OAPEN collection in 2014

When the same method is applied to the data of a three-month period in
2014, the differences are striking. During that time, 2,334 different titles
were downloaded 60,238 times, roughly twice the amount of 2012. However,
the number of providers ‘only’ raised 20% to 6,316 providers. Most of these
providers (69%) downloaded one book in a month; and the total percentage of providers that downloaded 5 titles or less is 98%. Furthermore, the
‘country top ten’ list contains the same countries, with the exception of
Ukraine, which replaces Poland.
The question is whether the changes in the collection affected the usage:
is it possible to detect the same clusters? Here, the number of clusters is
comparable to 2012: 41. The largest cluster contains 244 books and 723
providers, while the smallest cluster consists of one book and two providers.
Again, the largest ten clusters are compared to the data of the complete
collection.
The analysis resulted in the following ‘named clusters’:
• Cluster 1. German Language books. Books in the German language,
mostly downloaded by readers from Germany. Providers from Austria
and Switzerland are ranked third and fourth. Ranked #2 are providers
from the US.
• Cluster 2. Dutch Language books. Books in the Dutch language, mostly
downloaded by readers from The Netherlands. Comparable to Cluster 1,
the US providers rank second, followed by Belgium providers.

98

• Cluster 3. The largest clustering of Italian language books, but this cluster
also contains a large portion of German books. Here, Italian rank first,
followed by German providers.
• Cluster 5. Indonesia and South-East Asia. This cluster is comparable to
Cluster 9 of the 2012 data, containing books in the English language,
mostly discussing Indonesia and South-East Asia.
• Cluster 9. Australia and the Pacific region. English language books on
subjects related to Australia and the Pacific region. The US providers are
ranked first, Australian second.

The three largest clusters are once again connected to books in a specific
language, without a specific emphasis on a subject. We could argue that the
contents of Cluster 3 are relatively ‘diluted’: the number of German books is
higher than the books in Italian. However, it contains the largest concentration of Italian monographs, combined with a large Italian readership.
It is noteworthy that both Film studies and Immigration are less visible,
while books focusing on the Oceania region are easily spotted. An explanation may be found in the influx of new titles in the OAPEN Library. In 2013,
the collection grew with over 300 titles published by ANU Press, part of
Australian National University.
The number of titles on immigration did not grow as spectacular. Snijder
(2013) discusses the dissemination of books by the IMISCOE Research
Network on international migration, integration and social cohesion. The
majority of those book made available through the OAPEN library in 2012,
and the data of 2012 contains 50 IMISCOE titles. Most of them – 34 books
– are found in cluster 6: Immigration. Between 2012 and 2014, only ten
more titles were added – a total of 60 books. Compared to the growth of the
complete OAPEN Library collection, this is a modest increase.
The role of American providers is also unmistakable. According to The
World Factbook (Central Intelligence Agency, n.d.), the number of American
internet hosts is 505,000,000. A large number, compared to the second
country on the list – Japan – which contains 64,453,000 hosts; a factor 7 less.
Given these amounts, the prominent role of US providers is not surprising.

Creating recommendations based on clusters

We have discussed before that personal recommendation systems cannot be
used in open access libraries. It is nonetheless possible to detect patterns in
the use of the library, and with relative simple means, meaningful clusters
of books and providers can be detected; the current results can be seen as
a proof of concept. Contrary to the assertion of Lynch (2002), it is possible
to identify – up to a point – which user communities will engage with the
digital library. The detected patterns help at the very least to define interests
by larger groups of readers; a precondition for the creation of new services.
A possible service could entail listing groups of titles, to be presented
to certain groups of providers. The clustering results can be converted
into a set of recommendation rules, based on the contents of the book
combined with the nationality of the provider. For instance, the results from
cluster 1 of section 6.4.2 Analysis results – 2012 could be transformed into
the following ‘recommendation rule’: If the provider is based in Germany,
Austria or Switzerland and has downloaded a book in German, present a
list of all German books. Likewise, this combination of provider nationality
and non-English books could be applied to cluster 2 – Dutch language
books – and cluster 3 – Italian language books.
There are also subject-based clusters, for instance cluster 5 in section
6.4.4 Analysis results – 2014. Here, the recommendation might run along
the lines of presenting English language books on Indonesia or South-East
Asia to providers based in Indonesia, India or Pakistan. Cluster 5 of section
6.4.2 Analysis results – 2012 would lead to a more generic rule: if one English
language book on film and media studies has been downloaded, present
all English language titles on this subject.
The suggestions listed are not the result of a careful curation by a librarian, but are purely based on the usage patterns that have been uncovered.
Recommender systems are based on the preferences of individuals; the
suggestions here are based on the preferences of “implicitly defined communities” as described by Kumar et al. (1999). In this way, the flexibility
of recommender systems is deployed, without violating the privacy of
individuals.

6.6

Discussion

In the previous sections, we have seen the analysis and the possible recommendations based on its results. Yet, on a more abstract level there are

PATTER NS OF INFOR M ATION

101

several other aspects to reflect upon: the role of regional interests and how
well the deployed algorithm performs on the total collection.
When the different clusters are analysed, the influence of language
communities is profound. It might not come as a surprise that readers in
languages other than English tend to be more interested in publications
written in their ‘local’ language. Thus, the clusters of books in German,
Dutch or Italian are read mostly by native speakers. The language effect is
quite strong: within these clusters it is hard to find a subject based focus. In
contrast, if publications in English are taken into account it is still possible
to find clusters whose subject is closely tied to a region. This is especially
visible in the clusters focused on Indonesia and Sea East Asia, and the
cluster concerning Australia and the Pacific region. Even the subject of
immigration could be seen as a regional – mostly European – concern.
One might argue that the available data tends to point in this direction:
the main thing known about the readers are their provider’s countries.
Furthermore, one of the aspects analysed is the distribution of nationalities.
Given this procedure, it is rather hard to miss ‘regional’ patterns. On the
other hand, region is not the only scrutinised aspect. The books’ subject
and language are also taken into consideration. As an additional test, all
twenty clusters have been analysed using subject and language only. This
did not lead to new insights.
The clusters are the results of algorithms – predef ined procedures.
Deploying these procedures leads to interesting results: uncovering usage
patterns. We also saw that the results differ: in 2014, no clusters concerning
Film and media or Immigration were detected. Instead, the large influx of
books by an Australian publisher was visible. Does this mean that interest
in film or immigration studies has diminished? That might be possible, but
another option seems more likely: the performance of the algorithm when
it is applied to the collection.
Between 2012 and 2014, the collection nearly doubled. As was illustrated
by the example of the IMISCOE series and the books in Italian, the number
of books concerning a certain subject may not always keep pace with the
collection’s growth. The algorithm only detects the ‘strongest’ patterns,
based on relatively large groups. Thus, smaller clusters of books and readers
may go unnoticed.
The background section discussed several types of recommender systems. The variety hints at room for improvement: there is no single best
solution. This may also apply to this paper’s procedure; other procedures and
algorithms may yield improved results. A recent paper by Gläser, Glänzel,
& Scharnhorst (2017) illustrates this: the authors describe the search for

102

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

optimized deployment of algorithms to cluster articles into “thematic
clusters”. Different algorithms lead to different results, all of which might be
valid in their own way. The theme of this paper is also a clustering problem,
and thus the results by Gläser et al. could be applied here as well.
Simply put: the question is how to proceed from this starting point in order to create a fully functioning system? There are several points to explore.
Firstly, the results of several clustering algorithms should be evaluated.
We have seen that the currently used algorithm detected other groups in
the collection data of 2012 and 2014. Will other algorithms lead to strongly
differing results? Another avenue to explore is recursive use: deploying the
algorithm again on the clusters, in order to find ‘sub groups’. Earlier in the
paper, the question which clusters should be investigated was mentioned.
This might be an additional study. Lastly, the current analysis is depending
on human judgment, especially on the book’s subjects. In an open access
library, the documents are available in a full text form. Using text mining
techniques might help to automatically cluster the books, based on common
words or word sequences. It would be interesting to see if these ‘subject
clusters’ overlap with the clusters of providers.

6.7

Conclusion

This paper attempts to unravel the paradox of open access libraries: created
for maximum dissemination, but deploying one of the most powerful tools
to support its users leads to questions about privacy. Recommender systems
are used widely and with great success, but are built on storing information
about individuals. This is hard to accept from a privacy point of view, and
open access libraries are not normally equipped to individually track their
readers. However, every library functions better when it understands the
needs of its patrons.
Open access libraries are web based by definition, and the usage through
providers indicates the level of interest for each document. The thousands
of data points require the use of automated procedures. Applying social
networking analysis techniques helps to uncover patterns of usage that are
very hard to spot in a different way. With relative ease, it is possible to run
a meaningful analysis of the interests of groups of readers.
This paper’s results can be seen as a proof of concept; a possible starting point for recommendations built on usage that retain the privacy of
individual readers.

7.1

Monographs under pressure

In the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), monographs – instead of
articles – play an important part in communicating scholarly results.1
However, the publication of (paper) monographs faces challenges. Greco
and Wharton describe the problems faced by university presses, resulting in
smaller print runs per title and declining sales to libraries and institutions
(Greco & Wharton, 2008). Also, Thomson describes falling print runs and
declining sales (Thompson, 2005). The decline in dissemination of scientific
monographs is further illustrated by the Association of Research Libraries.
The expenditure for journals grew from more than $1,400,000 in 1986 to over
$7,513,000 in 2011. This contrasts sharply to the $1,120,000 spent in 1986 and
$1,936,000 spent in 2011 on monographs(“Association of Research Libraries
(ARL) :: ARL Statistics 2009-10,” 2012). Williams et al. also describe a decline
of sales combined with negative effects on print runs, but conclude that the
monograph remains the single most valued means of scholarly publishing
within the field of Arts & Humanities (Williams et al., 2009). Withey et al.
conclude that the economic model supporting monographs depends for a
significant amount on subsidies (Withey et al., 2011). This funding model
can only be sustained if the return on investments is clear.
This raises the question why monographs are used more than journal
articles. The answer might be found in the definition by Chodorow: “The
monograph is a large, specialized work of scholarship that treats a narrow
1 Psychology is an exception: in this field articles are used more than monographs (Schaffer,
2004).

106

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

topic in great detail.” He adds that “monographs are principally about establishing facts or narrative in a set of fields in which facts and narratives
are often hard to establish” (Chodorow, 1999). Due to its size, a monograph
enables researchers to describe the results of research spanning a long
period in sufficient detail. It is therefore best suited for the type of research
mostly conducted in the field of HSS. It is targeted at a specialised audience,
in contrast to a ‘text book’ which is designed for a more general audience.
However, in this article we will see that there is an interest in monographs
by the ‘general public’.
The monograph clearly performs a useful function in the field of HSS,
especially because of its length. An example of scholarly use of monographs
is described by Mendez and Chapman who investigated the role of monographs as sources in the field of Latin American History. They conclude that
the use of monographs as secondary sources – after a decline in the period
1985 to 1995 – is elevated to a higher level in 2005 (Mendez & Chapman,
2006).
However, scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences are expected to
describe their contribution to society. As in the field of Science, Technology
and Medicine (STM), there is a need to assess the value of scholarly output.

7.2

Scientific impact, societal relevance and monographs

In several countries government policies have been developed to assess the
quality of scientific and scholarly research, in other countries the assessment is done by academies of sciences. The aim is to enhance the quality
of scientific work and to maximise the societal benefits deriving from it.
Assessing the quality of research is normally done on two levels: at the level
of individual scientists or scholars and at the level of scientific or scholarly
output. The first level is measured through ‘esteem indicators’ as prizes
and scholarly positions, or the amount of international influence. At the
level of output we find ‘internal assessments’: peer review of documents
and ‘external assessments’ through bibliometric indicators, such as high
ranking journals, book series or publishers (Royal Netherlands Academy
of Arts and Sciences, 2010). Furthermore, the assessment must take into
account the variety of output forms – it should not be limited to journal
articles – and the bureaucratic burden must be limited.
On top of this, research and its outcomes can be categorised as Mode 1
and Mode 2, where Mode 1 research is done within the academic discipline,
and Mode 2 research aims at the application of research outcomes. This

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

107

concept was introduced by Gibbons (Gibbons, 1994); the application in
research evaluation is recently discussed by Ernø-Kjølhede and Hansson
(Ernø-Kjølhede & Hansson, 2011). Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz use a different
angle by looking at the relations between universities, governments and
industries: the “Triple Helix” (Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 1996).
Creating the best possible scientific or scholarly output is not a goal in
itself; the output should be used by others. Usage by scientists is termed
scientific impact; usage by others is termed societal relevance. Usage is not
exactly the same as impact; it functions as an indicator for impact. Measuring scientific impact in the field of HSS is poorly developed compared to the
field of STM. In the field of STM, the use of bibliometric measures such the
Journal Impact Factor (JIF) or the h-index is often discussed, although its
application is controversial and often inappropriate. In the field of HSS –
where articles play a smaller role in disseminating research results – similar
tools are not widely available.
However, Nederhof and Linmans have discussed the usage of bibliometric
tools in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Nederhof investigated
the possibilities of bibliometric research in the field of HSS and concludes
that it is possible to use the same methods as deployed in STM. It could be
done if more types of publications – monographs and journals not covered
by ISI – are taken into account and by applying impact indicators that
compensate for the smaller volumes of citations in the humanities and
social sciences, compared to the field of STM (Nederhof, 2006). Linmans
focuses on citations per author, not from a certain period but on lifelong
citation data. This method aims to make more citation data available, which
should lead to more robust results (Linmans, 2009).
Alternatives to the ‘standard’ bibliometric methods have also been
described. White et al. discuss ‘libcitations’, where the number of academic
libraries holding a certain book is the unit of measure. The collection of
a library is formed based on qualitative decisions; a monograph that is
acquired by a large number of libraries is ‘better’ than a monograph that
only resides in a few libraries (White et al., 2009). The MESUR project is not
only based on counting citations, but also focuses on the usage of online
sources – mostly journal articles – by scientists. The authors see online
usage as a better indicator for scientific impact than citations (Bollen et al.,
2009; Bollen, Van de Sompel, & Rodriguez, 2008). The method described in
this article is also based on measuring online usage, but here the focus is
not on journal articles; it is on monographs instead. Online usage is also
discussed by Herb et al., publishing work on the usage and interface design
of repositories – the most widely used way to disseminate open access

108

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

documents (Herb, 2010; Herb, Kranz, Leidinger, & Mittelsdorf, 2010). While
the discussed research uses quite different modes of operation, all of it is
aimed at scientific impact, not on societal relevance.
In order to measure the usage of scientific or scholarly output in society,
more elaborate methods are needed. Several researchers have published
work on defining societal relevance and the evaluation of the current frameworks. The methodology described by Lyall encompasses focus groups,
questionnaires, desk research and stakeholder analysis; a method which
does not seem to minimize bureaucratic demands (Lyall, Bruce, Firn, Firn,
& Tait, 2004). In the Netherlands, the same methodology was presented by
the QANU organisation (Bennink, Meijer, Wamelink, & Zuijdam, 2008).
The SIAMPI project defined three types of indicators (termed ‘productive
interactions’): direct or personal interactions; indirect interactions through
texts or artefacts and financial interactions through money or ‘in kind’
contributions (Spaapen & van Drooge, 2011). The method described here
measures one of the interactions: through the texts of electronic version
of monographs. Furthermore, current policy programs aimed on societal
relevance are studied. An example is the case study by Grant et al. of the
Australian RQF, the UK RAISS method, the US PART framework and the
Dutch ERiC framework (Grant, Brutscher, Guthrie, Butler, & Wooding, 2010).
Very little is known about the societal relevance of monographs. Only
recent, Serenko et al. have published research on societal relevance in the
field of knowledge management and intellectual capital (Serenko, Bontis,
& Moshonsky, 2011). Within knowledge management, there is a relatively
clear distinction between scholars and practitioners. As all stakeholders
are known, the flow of knowledge from one group to the other is not hard
to follow. In the social sciences, government agencies are considered to be a
major benefactor of the scientific results. Several usage studies – primarily
based on surveys and interviews – have been published (Bell, Shaw, & Boaz,
2011; Landry, Amara, & Lamari, 2001; Landry, Lamari, & Amara, 2003). In
other disciplines in the humanities, the picture is less clear. Benneworth
and Jongbloed show that the stakeholders – in other words: the groups
that would primarily benefit from research – are less visible to universities
(Benneworth & Jongbloed, 2009). Of course, if stakeholders are not known, it
is impossible to perform the kind of qualitative research described by Lyall.
Measuring scholarly impact and societal relevance in the humanities
and social sciences is not without problems. When methods based on
bibliographic data are used to assess scholarly impact, the lack of data
makes the results less reliable. The proposed and used methods to assess
societal influence are labour intensive; this requires a large investment in

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

109

time and money. Furthermore, the results are dependent on self-assessment
of the respondents. Of course, this may introduce bias: depending on the
respondent the perceived results may be too positive or too negative. In the
case of humanities, the picture becomes even less clear due to uncertainties
about the stakeholders.
This article describes a method that may complement the current
research on scientific impact and societal relevance. It relies on analysing
data generated by usage of electronic versions of monographs. Every time
a reader opens a web page or downloads a document, information about
the organisation through which the reader accesses the web is recorded. By
assessing this information, it is possible to determine the type of organisation and the county of origin. Due to extensive use of automated tools it
is less labour intensive than the previously described methods, and it may
uncover groups of users, even in disciplines where stakeholders are not well
known. The method is tested on data generated from the OAPEN Library.

7.3

The method

The method is based on the fact that books can be made available online,
in full or partial, through a dissemination channel. Those channels may
impose restrictions such as full or limited availability, enabling downloading, printing etc. Examples of dissemination channels are the Google Book
Search program, institutional repositories or e-book collections of academic
libraries. Each of these channels collect usage data, such as the number
of views or downloads and some information about the user. Almost all
web based channels list the web address of the ‘provider’: the organisation
that grants access to the internet. So, if a researcher of Leiden University
downloads a book using her or his off ice equipment, the web address
(www.leidenuniv.nl) of that university will be logged. Basic information
such as address and telephone number are publicly available and can be
found using the so called ‘WHOIS protocol’ (“WHOIS - Wikipedia,” n.d.).
By combining the usage data and information about the provider, we can
make an assumption about who is using a specific monograph. To put if
differently: the type of provider is used to assess the type of reader. In the
example used, the reader is affiliated with an academic institution, based
in the Netherlands.

110

7.3.1

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Defining stakeholders: scientific impact and societal relevance

If the dissemination channel is open to everybody, it may attract users
from all kinds of organisations. Not everybody will have an academic
organisation as provider; it may be another type of organisation or it will
be an Internet Service Provider (ISP). It then becomes necessary to define
several groups of organisations. Here, the following categories are used:
academic; government; business; non-profit organisations and the general
public. Academic users are seen as the main audience for monographs.
Based on the literature on societal relevance, we could divide the other
types of readers of monographs into the following categories: government,
business and general public. If the provider is an ISP, the reader cannot be
linked to an organisation. This could mean that the reader is not acting as
a member of an organisation, and may be categorised as a member of the
general public. In this article, another type of organisation is proposed:
non-profit organisations.
Within the humanities and social sciences, we might expect to find
stakeholders that are not commercial, who play a role in the discipline. In
the social sciences, government is seen as a significant stakeholder, and
government policies regarding certain subjects – for instance: immigration,
environment – receive considerable attention from non-profit organisations. Societal relevance by those types of organisations is therefore also
to be expected. As discussed before, the situation in the humanities is
less clear and stakeholders are not identified. Still, we might expect usage
from non-profit organisations. For instance, national history may cause
considerable interest.
Apart from the provider, information about the country from which
the data request originated is available, indicating the nationality of the
reader. This information can be used to classify the usage a bit further:
national versus international. In order to classify usage to be national or
international, we need to establish the ‘nationality’ of a monograph. Several
choices are available: the nationality of the author(s), the country of the
author’s organisation or the country of publication. Here, the country of
publication is used; the information about authors or their organisations
was not available.
This method can be used to measure the scientif ic impact and the
societal relevance of one monograph. The ratio of academic readers versus
other users may be used as an indication of the level of scientific impact
and societal relevance. Examining a group of monographs enables us to
look at other aspects as well: what is the influence of the monograph’s

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

111

subject or is language a barrier for international usage? The amount of
national and international usage could be closely linked to the language
of the monograph. When looking at the monograph’s subject, it may be
possible that different scientific disciplines display other usage patterns. For
instance, the percentage of users connected to a government organisation
may be larger in the social sciences than in the humanities.
Most literature on societal relevance does not explicitly focus on international usage; from a policy point of view societal relevance is looked at
on a national level. Policy makers are more likely to prioritize usage on a
national level as a way to measure the return on investments in science
done by national governments. Still, the international usage should also
be taken into account. As discussed before, international usage is used as
an indication of esteem. The percentage of usage outside national borders
may give an indication of the importance of the work. This reflects on the
authors; one of the ‘esteem indicators’ is the level of international interest.
The used data set contains books that are published in West European
countries. Usage is global however, ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe.
This also includes the so-called “developing countries”, with more limited
financial resources. The digital divide between the developing countries
and the developed countries could be described as a financial barrier to
access (Swan & Hall, 2010). Here, all monographs used are published in open
access, therefore this barrier does not exist here and this aspect will not be
discussed in this article.
Conclusions regarding these statistics must be drawn with caution. First
of all, the information found using the WHOIS protocol must be interpreted:
what type of organisation is described? If the organisation is a university, it is
quite clear. The question where to draw the line between an ISP and another
type of commercial organisation is less easy to answer. Also, organisational
affiliation does not tell anything about professional roles. For instance, if
the provider is a university, there is no way to tell whether the reader is a
student or a professor. Likewise, if the provider is an ISP, we cannot be sure
the reader used the online monograph for personal or professional reasons.
Regarding nationality, this too is not a 100% match: one could easily imagine
a Spanish reader downloading a monograph while in the USA. The user
statistic would then indicate the USA as country of origin. A possible remedy
could be found in using a survey, asking readers about their professional
affiliation, role and nationality. And finally, here we measure the number
of downloads. The number of downloads is an indication of readership: we
can assume that the more a book has been downloaded, the more is has

112

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

been read. But we cannot state that 100 downloads equal 100 people reading
the book cover to cover.
7.3.2

Selecting a channel to measure usage

In order to measure the usage of electronic monographs, we need access
to dissemination channels. One may consider academic libraries to be the
obvious choice. However, there are certain drawbacks to this dissemination
channel. First of all, measuring usage from an academic library constricts
the user population to the staff and students of that particular academic
institution. The composition of the group needs to be taken into account.
For instance, if faculties are significant different in size, it may reflect on
the usage measured. A far more serious problem is the fact that academic
libraries are not open to outsiders, making it impossible to measure societal
relevance. Furthermore, usage ‘outside’ of the library catalogue – of monographs found through search engines – is not measured.
Collections of monographs are not only found in libraries. Academic
publishers also have access to dissemination channels. Publishers have a
different interest from academic libraries; instead of serving one academic
community, publishers need to be known as widely as possible. This reflects
on their usage of dissemination channels: at the very least, information
on all available publications are accessible to everybody. Therefore, usage
data is not restricted to certain groups and could be used to measure both
scientific impact and societal relevance. Furthermore, access to the data is
not channelled through a library catalogue, but is wide open to both search
engines and other linking mechanisms – such as the Facebook website
(Vascellaro, 2009).

7.4

The OAPEN Library as dissemination channel

The method was tested on the OAPEN Library, which was officially launched
in September 2010. The OAPEN Consortium describes it as “an Online
Library containing a freely available, quality-proven and multilingual collection of monographs from various fields of HSS” (OAPEN Consortium,
2011). It is a web based collection of monographs, which are all available in
open access. The website offers several ways to make its contents accessible:
it enables searching and browsing, readers can share book descriptions via
social media and it contains several data feeds (Open Access Publishing in
European Networks, 2010b).

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

113

The OAPEN Library was used because its collection contains a diverse
range of subjects, published by dozens of publishers and in several languages. This creates a large data set, which contains sufficient large sets
of monographs with the same language, subject etc. For this article, the
number of downloads of the full year 2011 as measured through the Google
Analytics program were used. Google Analytics only measures the number
of downloads that result from a visit to the OAPEN Library website. This does
not draw a complete picture; all monographs can be directly downloaded,
without browsing the OAPEN Library website. So, if a reader uses a search
engine such as Google or Bing to find a book and downloads it directly
from there, the download will not be registered in Google Analytics. The
total number of downloads in 2011 is larger than 300,000. At this moment,
not all user statistics are available. Therefore, the Google Analytics data
will be used.
The data set used consists of a diverse set of monographs: 859 titles,
published by 30 publishers. There is also a wide range of languages available:
Danish; Dutch; English; French; German; Italian; Latin; Norwegian; Spanish and Welsh. For those titles, 25405 downloads were measured, by 1574
unique providers. Each provider was classified as one of the following types:
academic, government, business, non-profit or ISP. For each download, the
provider was further classified as national or international, depending on
the county of publication and the country of the provider: if the country
of publication equals the country of the provider, the provider is national;
otherwise it is classified as international. So, if the University of Exeter
downloads a book by the Dutch publisher Brill, it is classified as Academic
(International). When a book published by Manchester University Press
is downloaded by the University of Exeter, it is classified as Academic
(National).

7.5

Setup of the research

The goal of the research is to test the method and gather quantitative data
about scientific impact and societal relevance of scientific monographs.
This type of research is new; therefore, no best practice is established. Here,
the percentage of downloads per type of provider is used as a measure for
scientific impact and societal relevance, combined with the average number
of downloads per group of titles. By comparing these groups, we may be
able to find significant differences. No benchmark is available, so it is not
possible to say how well a certain monograph ‘performs’.

114

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Monograph usage can be measured on two levels:
1. At the level of separate titles
2. At the level of the complete collection
7.5.1

Measuring usage at the level of separate titles

In this article, the data at the level of the complete collection or at the level
of large subsets will be discussed in most detail. It is possible to analyse
each monograph’s usage. The following example shows the usage data for
the book Globalization contested: An international political economy of work2
written by Louise Amoore and published by Manchester University Press
in 2002.
About 23% of the usage comes from (international) academic institutions, and almost 70% is generated by foreign ISPs. The remaining usage
is generated by a company, a British ISP and a non-profit organisation: the
International Atomic Energy Agency. We will see that those figures are no
exception: the average usage percentages per provider type are more or
less along these lines. The international usage is truly worldwide; this is
also typical for all the measured data, which originated from 102 countries.

Measuring usage at the level of the complete collection

Looking at the usage data of all books, it is clear that most traffic comes from
ISPs, followed by usage from academic institutions. While usage by government or business is discussed as the primary source of societal relevance,
here it plays a minor role. Furthermore, 85% of the usage is international.

Are all ISPs equal?

The high percentage of usage coming from ISPs presents an unexpected
problem. Without further refinement, almost 68% of the usage is hard to
categorize. A method is needed to distinguish whether the usage comes
from users whose organisation does not provide internet access or from
users who are downloading the monographs ‘from home’. The solution can
be found by looking at the internet infrastructure per country, combined
with the percentage of ISPs.
7.6.1

Internet infrastructure and ISPs

The internet infrastructure differs from country to country. We might
assume that in countries with a highly-developed internet infrastructure,

117

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

most organisations are capable of directly providing internet access to
their employees. In contrast, access to the internet will almost certainly
be provided through an ISP in countries with a weakly developed internet
infrastructure. In other words: we might expect that in countries with a
highly-developed infrastructure, ‘professional users’ are more likely to
use the internet access provided by their organisation and the users who
access the OAPEN Library through an ISP are not doing that as part of their
professional role.
In order to assess the state of the internet infrastructure per country,
statistical data from the World Bank is used. The publication The Little Data
Book on Information and Communication Technology 2011 contains several
indicators on the state of the IT infrastructure per country (World Bank,
2011). One of the indicators is the amount of internet users per 100 people.
When this indicator is plotted against the percentage of ISPs per country
found in the data, we find that in countries with a higher percentage of
internet users – countries with a better developed infrastructure – the
percentage ISPs is lower.

When we look at the data we might assume that the people using a
highly-developed internet infrastructure are less likely to use an ISP if they
download books from the OAPEN Library in their professional role. So,
downloads through an ISP from countries with a highly-developed internet
infrastructure are more likely to be coming from non-professional users.
The next question to answer is which countries are considered to have a
highly-developed infrastructure. Plotting all countries displays a smooth
descend from 94.5 internet users per 100 people (Iceland) to 0.5 (Ethiopia).

In order to find a suitable cut off point, the number of providers of all
countries was listed. From this list, the 25 countries with the highest number
of providers – regardless of the type – were selected, and the number of
internet users per 100 people was plotted in the following chart.

The first cut off point can be found between Switzerland (70.9 internet
users per 100 people) and the Czech Republic (63.7 internet users per 100
people). Therefore, it is assumed that all countries with 70 or more internet
users per 100 people have a highly-developed internet infrastructure and ISP
usage from these countries is more likely to come from the ‘general public’.
The 25 countries with the highest number of providers are listed below.

A refined categorisation of ISP usage statistics

Refining the categorisation of the ISP usage statistics does paint quite a
different picture. The percentage of data generated by ISPs is now divided
into 31.86% that cannot be categorised as ‘private’ or ‘professional’ use and
almost 36% where the possibility of ‘personal’ usage is much higher. If we
combine this with the other categories, more than two thirds of the usage
data can be explained!

Possible influences on usage

In the next paragraphs, two possible influences on the usage in the OAPEN
Library will be discussed: subject and language. Using the average number
of downloads per group of titles, the distribution of the providers will be
analysed. The average number of downloads is used here to compensate for
the varying number of titles per subject or language. As described below,
the number of titles with the same subject ranges from 65 to 22 titles. The
same holds true for titles in the same language: the set contains 460 books
in English; 105 in Dutch; 112 in Italian and 126 written in German.
After analysing the data on the level of the complete OAPEN Library
or relative large subsets, the data on the level of individual books will be
discussed. However, the analysis at the individual level will be less thorough.
7.7.1

Subject – highest level

In the OAPEN Library, the subject of the books is described using the BIC
classification (Book Industry Communication, 2010). Due to its hierarchical
nature, the classification assigned to each book can be abbreviated. This
results in a larger group of monographs which share the same – broad –
subject. The usage data of the 10 largest groups were compared with the
averages of all books in the OAPEN Library, to see if the usage patterns differ
significantly. In the following table, all data is normalised to the average
number of downloads per subject.

When looking at the average number of downloads, it is striking that
subjects from the social sciences – Sociology and anthropology, Society
and culture, Politics and government – are more ‘popular’ than well-known
subjects from the humanities, such as History, Philosophy and Literature.
The large differences in downloads per subject raise the question whether
this is caused by differences in the usage per readers group. For instance,
is the large uptake on Sociology and anthropology caused by relative high
academic usage? In order find the answer, the percentages of usage per
provider was computed.

Here, the distribution across the subjects does not change dramatically,
with the exception of History, Linguistics and Literature. For these subjects
the academic national usage is relatively high. In the case of History, the
explanation may lie in the fact that if the historic subject is national, the
usage will tend to be national as well. Linguistics and Literature are of
course closely bound to national languages; the percentage of academic
readers interested in their national language will be greater than readers
interested in foreign languages.
Furthermore, the largest percentages of national ‘ISP usage’ coming from
countries with a high number of internet usage – in other words: readers
that are most likely to be interested for non-professional reasons – are to
be found with History and Linguistics. In contrast, the usage of legal books
(Laws of Specific jurisdictions) by government agencies and businesses is
relatively high, but is still dwarfed by academic and ‘ISP usage’.
7.7.2

Language – highest level

The collection of the OAPEN Library contains several languages. Not all
languages are equally represented. Therefore, only the largest groups are
discussed. In the following table, all data is normalised to the average
number of downloads per language.

When looking at the total number of downloads per average title, it
becomes clear that English is the most read language: it amounts to approximately 150% of the average of the complete OAPEN Library usage. The
average downloads of Dutch titles is almost twice as high as the number of
downloads for titles in Italian and German. The explanation may be found
in the fact that 14% of all usage data originated in the Netherlands, while
Italian providers are responsible for 4% and German providers for 8%.
The differences in usage may also be connected to differences in usage
by each reader group. For that reason, the percentages of usage per provider
was computed.

The percentages reveal the ‘national appeal’ of Dutch language titles: the
percentages of national usage – both academic and coming from ISPs – are
far greater than the other languages, or the average of all books. The international usage coming from ISPs is by far the lowest, and the percentage of
international academic use is also lower compared to the other languages.
National usage for Dutch language books is of course coming from both the
Netherlands and from Belgium. In this particular case, the Dutch language
books published by Dutch publishers account for 35% of the usage data,
while the Dutch language books published by Belgian publishers account
for 4.5% of the usage.
In contrast, the books written in English have the lowest percentages
of national usage. This is of course not surprising: English functions as the
‘lingua franca’ of science. The percentages of German and Italian books
fall between these two extremes. From this we might conclude that books
written in English, German and Italian appeal to a far more international
audience than those written in Dutch. If Dutch or Belgian authors want
their work to be used outside their countries, translation is necessary. The
same effect was found for Danish, but the number of titles was much lower:
22. Therefore these titles were not taken into account here.

Subject – book level

Here, all downloads per individual title are analysed, per subject. The
main goal is to look at the skewedness of the total number of downloads:
is it heavily influenced by just a few titles, or is the number of downloads
spread relatively even? Furthermore, the usage percentages of the 15 most
downloaded titles are visualised, in order to determine if they deviate
greatly from the percentages of the whole group.
It becomes clear that the social sciences are more prone to skewed distributions of downloads, compared to humanities. The groups Sociology and
anthropology, Society and culture and Politics and government all contain
a title that is downloaded far more than the rest. All these titles with an
exceptional number of downloads were authored by members of IMISCOE
Research Network.3 The website of the IMISCOE Network contains links
to all books in the OAPEN Library. This may be the reason for the high
number of downloads.
When we look at the usage percentages, we see that lower number of
downloads seem to correlate with higher differences in percentages. A good
example can be found in the group Laws of Specific jurisdictions, where the
title Videovernehmung kindlicher Zeugen ; zur Praxis des Zeugenschutzgesetzes, ISBN 9783938616833 shows a usage percentage of 40% by foreign
government organisations. This looks very spectacular, but it is caused by
2 downloads. Small differences give high percentages!
Each book is identif ied using ISBN (International Standard Book
Number).

see a large difference in usage percentages, but a small number of overall
downloads.

7.7.4
Language – book level

The analysis on languages shows the same pattern: a low number of downloads seems to be correlated with high diversity in percentages. This is best
illustrated with the differences between English and German. The usage
percentages for English – where the average number of downloads per book
is 45.29 – are not much different. This contrast with German, where the
average number of downloads is much lower: 7.79.

Conclusion

7.8.1

The method as addition to existing assessments

The problem addressed in this article is the measurement of scientific
impact and societal relevance in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences. When looking at methods to measure scientific impact through the
published output, we saw that the standard bibliometric methods employed
in the field of Science, Technology and Medicine – where publishing in
articles is the norm – do not function well in a field where monographs
are the standard. Quantitative methods that do take monographs into
account are aimed at measuring scientific impact only, leaving out the
societal benefits.
The methods used to assess societal relevance also have drawbacks. First
of all, most of these methods are qualitative, depending on self-assessments
by scholars and on opinions by representatives of stakeholders outside
academia. Apart from possible subjective biases, these methods require that
stakeholders are known. This is not always the case in the field of HSS, especially in the humanities. Another aspect is the amount of labour involved:
discussions with focus groups, sending questionnaires and conducting desk

148

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

research and stakeholder analysis requires quite a lot of manpower. Societal
relevance is hard to measure in the field of HSS, especially when the groups
that would primarily benefit from research are not always known. In the
field of STM, patents are used as an indicator, but a comparable indicator
for HSS research has not been defined.
In this article, a new method is used to overcome some of those issues.
This method measures the usage of monographs and identifies the organisation responsible for the internet access. Therefore, both the usage and
the readers of each monograph are known. The amount of usage – here
restricted to number of downloads – by each type of reader could be used
to assess the value of scientific or scholarly output.
The method is quantitative, which makes the results easier to validate.
The amount of measurements is also large: the data set for this article
consists of over 25,000 downloads by more than 1,500 providers, spread over
859 monographs. A large data set reduces the chances of outliers influencing
the results. It is not necessary to know the stakeholders in advance: the
method is used to identify the readers. This solves one of the identified
problems: especially in the field of humanities, where benefactors besides
academics are not always known. Knowing other users besides academics
makes it easier to assess the societal relevance. Another drawback of the
described qualitative methods is the labour intensity; by relying heavily on
automated tools, this method is relatively easy to execute. Furthermore, one
of the problems attached to measuring societal relevance is attribution: how
to measure the influence of a certain scholar? Here we look at the usage of
books, which makes it easy to identify the influence of each author.
7.8.2

Discussion of the results

When looking at the results, it becomes clear that the monographs are not
used exclusively by scholars. From the measured data, over 27% is directly
linked to academic users. The percentage of usage that can be linked directly
to other ‘professional’ users is quite small: less than 5%. This leaves a large
portion of users that cannot be categorised immediately. By taking into
account the percentage of ISPs per country, this group is further categorised.
This results in a group of users that cannot be categorised and a group of
users – more than 35% of all users – that have a higher probability to be
‘non-professional users’, also known as the ‘general public’. Taken together,
more than 68% of the usage can be categorised, and almost 45% of all usage
comes from non-academics. This might indicate that the monographs have
an impact in society.

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

149

In order to further refine the results, two possible influences on monograph usage were analysed: subject and language. When looking at the influence of subject on usage, we saw that the average number of downloads per
subject varies widely. Most of the subjects that received a higher number of
downloads than the average of the total set come from the field of the social
sciences. The humanities were less ‘popular’, with amounts that lie mostly
below the average for the complete set. If we use this as a measure of societal
relevance, we might conclude that monographs in the social sciences enjoy
a relatively large readership outside academia. The number of books on a
certain subject may have influenced these results, but it is not very likely:
65 books on Sociology and anthropology receive an average number of 62.98
downloads, and 51 books on Society and culture are downloaded 44.02
times on average. In contrast, 151 History books – a much larger amount of
titles – are downloaded 24.42 times on average. If the usage percentages
per group were taken into account, it becomes clear that they do not differ
significantly. Only History, Linguistics and Literature are the exception:
here the percentage of ‘national’ usage is higher. These subjects might have
a tendency to be bound to national borders.
In order to measure the influence of language on monograph usage, the
four largest language groups were analysed. Again, the average number
of downloads and the percentages per groups were used. It was hardly
surprising to discover that books in English – the ‘lingua franca’ of science
– were downloaded the most. A more interesting discovery was the fact that
some languages such as Dutch (and Danish) were read much less outside of
national borders that Italian or German. While a Dutch or Belgian scholar
would need a translation in order to have more influence abroad, this does
apply far less for Germans or Italians.
The analysis on the level of individual books revealed that within the
social sciences, the distribution of usage was relatively more skewed than
within the humanities: the groups Sociology and anthropology, Society and
culture and Politics and government all contain a title that is downloaded
far more than the rest. It is interesting to note that all these books were
written by authors connected to the IMISCOE4 network. Possibly, readers
were alerted through the IMISCOE website.
The results give an indication of the usage, and it becomes clear that HSS
monographs are read outside academia, proving the societal relevance.
Below, the conclusions are discussed a little further.

See: http://www.imiscoe.org

150

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

First of all, the research method is based on measuring usage of electronic versions of monographs. The usage data of the paper versions – such
as sales figures or borrowing data from libraries – were not available. It
would be interesting to see if the percentage of user categories would differ
dramatically. Given the economic circumstances discussed in the first
paragraph, we might conclude that the dissemination of paper books is
far less successful that electronic ones. However, it may be possible that
a certain group of readers prefers the paper monograph to the electronic
version, and this aspect has not been taken into account.
Another aspect is the dissemination channel. In earlier research done
by the author (Snijder, 2010), it became clear that different dissemination
channels display different results. There, the usage through an institutional
repository was significantly smaller than usage through the Google Book
Search program. Here, one dissemination channel is used and therefore we
cannot compare the usage patterns. In other words: we cannot determine
if the low usage by government agencies, non-profit organisations and
businesses is solely caused by the contents of the monographs, or whether
it is partly caused by the fact that the OAPEN Library is not used by these
types of organisations. Another aspect of the OAPEN Library is that it only
hosts open access monographs. This means that the complete text of the
books is fully available online. As there is no comparable data set available
of monographs that are not fully accessible, we cannot determine how usage
is influenced by open access.
The data analysed is the usage measured through the OAPEN website;
direct downloads are not taken into account. At this point, only the total
number of downloads is available – no other data. When the complete data
becomes available, it will be interesting to see whether the percentage of
‘ISP’ usage will become smaller. The total number of downloads in 2011 –
over 300,000 – is more than 6 times higher than the number of downloads
in the current data set. This much larger number of ‘direct’ downloads may
come from library systems or other collections of book data. These data
files will probably have been made available to ‘professional’ users, such
as academics or civil servants. This may explain the small percentage of
government use, or it may uncover a much higher scientific and scholarly
use.
7.8.3

Possible refinements to the method

The method in its current form uses relatively broad categories. Users are
divided into 6 groups and are categorised as national or international. Based

MEASURING MONOGR A PHS

151

on these categories, it is simple to make analyses on an abstract level. By
doing so, smaller effects based on specific books are not visible. One of the
possible refinements could be categorisation on countries. This enables us
to look at a more detailed level. For instance, the books published by KITLV
Press are mostly downloaded through Indonesian providers. The reason for
this is clear: the subject of all KITLV titles is South East Asia, and most of
those monographs describe themes from Indonesia. An analysis on country
level may uncover more of these effects, but the level of detail required is
beyond the scope of this article.
Another refinement could be found in analysing the usage patterns for
each individual author. Before, the usage per subject has been analysed.
We could use the percentages of the groups of readers as a ‘baseline’ to
compare the usage patterns of the work or works from a certain author.
Again, we cannot be sure how the dissemination channel influences the
results. Therefore, this kind of analysis should be done with caution, and
preferably at a time where more experience with using this method has
been gained.

7.8.4

Evaluation of the results

In this article, a method is introduced to measure both the scientific and
the societal relevance of the Humanities and Social Sciences, by measuring
the usage of its main publication form: the monograph. While both the
monograph and the field of HSS are under pressure, we saw that there is a
considerable interest; from both inside and outside academia. We could say
that this is a good result: it indicates the scholarly impact and the societal
relevance of HSS. Furthermore, it was possible to measure the influence of
subject and language. On the other hand, some of the results were mixed.
The usage patterns differ strongly from the literature on societal relevance:
contrary to expectations, the data show a low usage percentage by ‘professionals’. Whether this is a property of HSS usage or it is caused by the used
channel and data set is a question that needs further research. However,
the results of this article are promising, and the proposed method can be
used as an addition to the existing toolkit.

Introduction

The discussion on open access (OA) has many aspects; one of those aspects
is the digital divide between developed and developing countries. The
digital divide is defined as the inequality in access to the internet, both
in a technical sense – a less than optimal infrastructure – and in lack of
knowledge to make the best use of the available online resources. Open
Access is seen as a way to lower financial barriers for scientists and other
readers. Recently, this was discussed by Swan and Hall (Swan & Hall, 2010),
who conclude that while putting the idea in practice is not simple, the
growth of OA is not only inevitable but also desirable.
Before them, several others also saw chances in freely accessible scientific
publications. While each author discusses the inequalities from different
angles, the possibilities of open access publishing – combined with changes
in institutional and political structures – offer a chance for improvement.
Ahmed discusses the digital divide in Africa in great detail, and identifies
the required policy changes to amend it. (Ahmed, 2007) Salager-Meyer
discusses the inequalities that exist in academic publishing between the
developed and the developing countries. Her focus is on journal publishing.
(Salager-Meyer, 2008) Christian also discusses the inequalities in funding,
IT related infrastructure and possible misconceptions about OA. (Christian,
2008) Likewise, Papin reports on the difficulties that arise when funding is not adequate for publishing in open access journals that charge an
author’s fee. (Papin-Ramcharan & Dawe, 2006) In the chapter ‘Development’
Willinsky describes the difficulties that university libraries in developing
countries face, and proposes developing and OA publication model as a

154

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

possible remedy. (Willinsky & Parry, 2006) Armstrong and Ford focus on
the intellectual property rights by discussing the effects of WIPO treaties in
contrast to licenses based on Creative Commons. (Armstrong & Ford, 2006)
Chan and Costa review several programs such as HINARI, AGORA, eIFL.
net, PERI and compare them to directly publishing in open access journals
and ‘green’ open access. (Chan & Costa, 2005) And Ghosh and Kumar Das
conclude in their extensive overview that India is leading the open access
movement among the developing countries and – by doing so – it is making
the developed countries aware of the qualities of scholars and scientists
from the developing countries. (Ghosh & Kumar Das, 2007)
Very little research is published on the effects of open access publishing
on developing countries, mostly on the citation impact of freely accessible articles. Calver and Bradley investigated citations of OA and non-OA
papers in six journals and four books published since 2000, in the field
of conservation biology. They did find an OA citation advantage for book
chapters, but the number of citations papers or chapters received from
authors in developing countries did not increase. (Calver & Bradley, 2010)
Norris, Oppenheim, and Rowland, however, did see a larger percentage
of citations from developing countries given to OA articles in the field of
mathematics than is the case for citations from developed countries. (Norris,
Oppenheim, & Rowland, 2008) Walker describes the growth of Bioline
International, which enables OA publishing of journals from a wide range
of developing countries. Apart from usage data, she describes the citation
advantage enjoyed by open access articles. (Walker, 2009)
No research was found on usage of articles, or on academic books.

8.2

Open access monographs and the digital divide

This article tries to answer the question whether open access publishing
does actually help to lessen the digital divide between developed and
developing countries. As will be described in more detail below, usage
data of an earlier experiment with open access monographs was combined
with geographical data: from which country does the traffic originate? All
countries were divided into two groups: developing countries and developed
countries. In order to find whether open access does have a positive effect on developing countries, a group of titles with restricted access was
compared to another group of fully accessible monographs. Using statistical
analysis, the percentages of book discovery and usage were compared. If the

DO DEV ELOPING COU NTRIES PROFIT FROM FREE BOOKS?

155

percentages of the group of fully accessible titles are significantly higher, the
claim that open access does benefit developing countries may be supported.
The collection of monographs used for this experiment were published
by Amsterdam University Press (AUP), an academic publisher mainly of
books in the field of humanities and social sciences. AUP is owned by the
University of Amsterdam and works on a not-for-profit basis. (AUP, 2012)
AUP publishes around 200 books per year, combined with several journals,
some of which are published both on paper and online, some as an open
access e-journal. AUP has coordinated the OAPEN (open access Publishing
in European Networks) project where several academic publishers worked
together to develop an open access business model for monographs in
humanities and social sciences, combined with the creation of an open
access library. (Open Access Publishing in European Networks, 2010a) From
spring 2011, OAPEN continued as a separate organization with AUP as one
of its shareholders.
In 2009, an experiment was conducted at Amsterdam University Press to
measure the impact of open access publishing of academic books. (Snijder,
2010) During a period of nine months three sets of 100 books were disseminated through an institutional repository, the Google Book Search
program or both channels. A fourth set of 100 books was used as control
group. As one of the research questions concerned the role of dissemination
channels, this division was used.
One of the findings was that open access publishing enhances discovery
and online usage of academic books, regardless of the dissemination channel used. Therefore, in this article the titles will be divided into a group of
freely accessible titles – without taking into account the dissemination
channel – and a closed access group. From April 2009 until December
2009, access to the 400 publications was strictly controlled. Since then,
access to several titles has changed which strongly impacts the discovery
and online usage.
While the experiment confirmed that books in open access were found
more and were used more, it was not known who was using them. The
Google Book Search program enabled5 publishers to monitor geographic
information: how many times are books opened from which country?
Therefore, in the first months of 2011 this data was gathered and combined
with the existing data to answer the research question: does a change in
accessibility of academic books have an effect on developing countries?
From this question, two hypotheses were derived:
5

This feature became unavailable since the last months of 2011

156

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Hypothesis 1: The discovery of fully accessible titles in developing countries is significantly higher, compared to titles which are not fully accessible.
Discovery is measured as the number of ‘Book visits’ a title receives in the
Google Book Search program. Book visits are defined as each time that a
unique user views a book. (Google Books, n.d.)
Hypothesis 2: The online usage (i.e. pages read) of fully accessible titles in
developing countries is significantly higher, compared to titles which are not
fully accessible. Online usage is measured as the number of page views a title
receives in the Google Book Search program. Page views are defined as the
number of unique pages a user views within a 24-hour period. Regardless
of the number of times that a unique user views a page, it is only registered
once. (Google Books, n.d.)

8.3

Setup of the experiment

The first question to be answered of course is which countries are developing countries. Countries differ wildly in all aspects, and deciding which
factors are used to decide which country belongs in what group is not easy.
For this experiment, all countries listed under ‘Emerging and Developing
Economies’ in the World Economic Outlook Database April 2010 are used –
with Somalia added to the list. (International Monetary Fund, 2010) The
web statistics revealed traffic coming from 179 different countries. Less
than a third of those – 48 countries – are marked as developed countries,
although those countries generate 70% of the discovery data and 73% of
online usage data.
See http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/images/3336451.0016.103-00000001.
txt for the list of all developing countries.
Dividing all countries in two groups is of course a simplification. Doing
so enables us to scale down a problem of enormous complexity to a relative
simple question. At this point, quantitative data on the effects of open
access on the use of monographs is scarce, especially the use in developing
countries.
In order to enable further research, the data for the titles are made available in http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/images/3336451.0016.103-00000002.
csv.
The experiment consists of creating 4 equal sets of 100 titles; each title is
placed in one of four sets. The different sets are defined using two variables:
accessibility and channel: each set is disseminated using a specified channel
and accessibility settings. For a period of 9 months, starting in April 2009,

157

DO DEV ELOPING COU NTRIES PROFIT FROM FREE BOOKS?

the effect on discovery and online usage is measured. Discovery and online
usage are measured using the number of views and downloads from the
respective channels.
The division of titles can be summarized as follows:

content of each book is indexed by the Google search engine. The titles in
this set are not uploaded into the AUP repository. The accessibility of this
set is the lowest.
Set 2: Freely available via the repository; visible for 10% in Google Book
Search. The titles of this set are uploaded in the AUP repository. For each
title, a record is created in the repository database containing metadata and
an electronic version of the book. The ‘visibility settings’ of Google Book
Search are not changed and remain at 10 %.
Set 3: Visible for 100% in Google Book Search and freely available via the
repository. The titles of this set are uploaded in the AUP repository, and the
‘visibility settings’ of Google Book Search are set to 100%. The titles in this
set are fully accessible through both channels. The accessibility of this set
is the highest.
Set 4: Visible for 100% in Google Book Search; not available via the repository. For this set, the ‘visibility settings’ of Google Book Search are set to
100%. The books are not placed in the AUP repository.
As all titles are accessible through the Google Book Search program, the
interest of readers can be measured with the Book Search usage statistics.
Here, ‘Book visits’ – measuring the number of times the webpage of the
book is accessed – and ‘page views’ – which measure the number of pages
opened – are the statistics used. Geographical usage data was also available
in the Google Book Search program. For each title, a monthly report was
downloaded, containing the percentages per country. The statistics per
country are measured by applying the percentages to the absolute number
of Book visits and page views.

158

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

When the statistics from each country per title are known, the percentage
of usage coming from developing countries is measured. For instance, the
title The Making and Unmaking of an Industrial Working Class : Sliding down
the Labour Hierarchy in Ahmedabad, India was accessed online from 40
different countries between April and December 2009. This resulted in 418
Book visits and 5115 page views. The number of Book visits from developing
countries was 208 and the number of page views from developing countries
was 2737. So, for this title the percentage measured for Book visits is 49,8
and the percentage for page views is 53,5. It may not come as a surprise that
traffic from India explains the high percentages for this particular title. As
I will explain later, this percentage is an exception: for most titles, there is a
large gap between usage by developed countries and developing countries.
Furthermore, this paper will not discuss in detail the differences in
discovery and online usage from individual countries. For that, several
variables that are not part of the data must be examined. One of the criteria
is the role of English within the academic communities. While English is
widely used, it may not be the preferred language in all communities. The
data set does not contain books in French, Spanish, Portuguese or Mandarin,
to name a few languages. Another criterion to examine is the subject of the
books. While the examined books cover a wide range of subjects, it may be
possible that certain research communities would be as interested in the
provided titles as others. As described below, subject is one of the elements
used in the selection of titles.

8.4

Selection of titles and removal of bias

In April 2009, 893 titles were available at AUP. Using commercial availability,
imprint, publication date and series this list was reduced to 412 ISBNs. Of
this list, 22 titles were published both as a hardback and a paperback book.
As this distinction is irrelevant in the digital domain, 11 ISBNs were removed
from the list. Then the oldest title – published in 1994 – was removed, resulting in a list of 400 titles.
Considerable effort has been put in the removal of bias. This experiment
operates using four sets of books; therefore, these sets must be as equal as
possible. Each of the 400 books is compared using the following criteria:
subject; type of work; language; expected sales and publication date.
In the database of AUP each title is assigned several subject codes
describing the content. For the sake of the experiment, all titles from a
‘subject based series’ were assigned the same subject codes. Furthermore,

159

DO DEV ELOPING COU NTRIES PROFIT FROM FREE BOOKS?

the number of subject codes was reduced in order to create relatively
large groups with the same subject. The same principle was applied to the
expected sales, measured by the print run. While each individual title may
have a different print run – from 0 for Print on Demand titles to 6500 – an
amount rounded up to the next 500 was used. This created again relatively
large groups, which could be evenly divided over the four sets. Also, the
publication year and the language of the title were taken into account and
were ‘spread’ as evenly as possible.
The 400 titles are written in three languages: Dutch (212 titles); English
(180 titles) and German (8 titles). One could argue that using a large percentage of Dutch language titles favours the usage from Belgium and the
Netherlands. Furthermore, German is mostly spoken in European countries.
For this reason, the selection is reduced to the English language titles only.
Language is one of the criteria used to create equal sets, so excluding Dutch
and German still leads to a balanced distribution: Set 1 contains 43 titles;
Set 2 contains 49 titles; Set 3 contains 42 titles and Set 4 contains 46 titles.
As stated before, previous research found that open access publishing
enhances discovery and online usage of academic books, regardless of
the dissemination channel used. (Snijder, 2010) Therefore, the statistical
analysis will be conducted on the average measurements of the open access
channels versus the data from the closed access channel.

Research results and documenting the digital divide

A first analysis of the data clearly shows the digital divide between developed and developing countries. When looking at the discovery of books, only
30% of the internet traffic comes from developing countries. This is in stark
contrast with the United States, from where 19% of all traffic originates.
Table 2 depicts the five highest ranking developed and developing countries,
and Figure 1 illustrates this.

The same story could be told about online usage. Here, the percentages are
almost equal: the developing countries account for 27% of the total number
of page views, coming from 30% of all Book visits. Again, the country with
the largest usage percentage is the United States with 18%. Also, the second
and third largest portions come from the same countries: United Kingdom
and the Netherlands. See Table 3 for the five highest ranking developed and
developing countries and Figure 2 for more details.

The previous analysis did show the large gap between the developing and
the developed countries, but the effect of open access publishing was not
taken into account. The experiment run on 400 titles – see (Snijder, 2010)

162

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

– revealed that discovery and online usage of books was enhanced. When
looking at the 180 English language titles, the same pattern emerges: books
that are freely accessible online are found more and used more. This effect
can be found with the developed and the developing countries.
Again, the digital divide is also clearly visible. The average number of
Book visits is used as measure for the discovery rate of books. When those
books are published in closed access, the average rate from developing
countries is 127 versus 491 in developed countries; in other words: 20.6%
of the average Book visits come from developing countries. Open Access
leads to higher average rates: 611 for developing countries versus 1291 for
developed countries; the developing countries are responsible for 32.1%.
Online usage is affected in the same way: the average number of page
views of books in closed access is 1526 for developing countries and 4542
for developed countries; the percentage for developing countries is 25.1%.
Making books fully accessible leads to an average of 5357 page views from
developing countries, compared to 14278 page views in developed countries;
the percentage for developing countries rises to 27.3%. This is illustrated
in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

The research question ‘does a change in accessibility of academic books have
an effect on developing countries?’ was translated into two hypotheses. The
experiment’s data was analysed using ANOVA (analysis of variance) in order
to test the hypotheses. The results are summarized in Table 4.
Table 4 Hypothesis results
Hypothesis

Result

Hypothesis 1: The discovery of fully
accessible titles in developing countries
is significantly higher, compared to titles
which are not fully accessible.

There was a significant effect of accessibility on discovery in developing countries,
F(3,176) = 1.76, p < .05, one-tailed.

Hypothesis 2: The online usage (i.e. pages
read) of fully accessible titles in developing
countries is significantly higher, compared
to titles which are not fully accessible.

There was a significant effect of accessibility
on online usage in developing countries,
F(3,176) = 1.78, p < .05, one-tailed.

8.6

Discussion of the results

Hypothesis 1 states that the discovery of fully accessible titles in developing countries is significantly higher compared to titles which are not
fully accessible. Discovery was measured as the percentage of Book visits
emerging form developing countries a title received in the Google Book
Search program during the experimentation period. The results of the
experiment confirmed the hypothesis, which strengthens the claims of

164

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

the advocates of open access: access to researchers from the developing
countries is improved.
The results are also in line with predictions from the library and information sciences and the field of e-commerce. In the library and information
sciences, accessibility to scientific output is linked to research impact. This
is discussed by Harnad et al. (Harnad et al., 2004, 2008) When barriers are
removed, the output – in this case: academic books – is used to maximum
effect. The field of e-commerce uses a concept called search costs, which
acts as a barrier to transactions. For a more comprehensive discussion of
this concept, see Bakos and Granados, Gupta, and Kauffman. (Bakos, 1991;
Granados, Gupta, & Kauffman, 2006) Making the complete content of a
publication available should lower the search costs considerably, especially
if search engines have complete access as well, which may lead to easier
discovery of the book. Here, the transaction is acquiring an academic book.
Publishing in open access lowers those barriers, which indeed has positive
effects.
Book visits are used as an approximation to discovery: it was not possible
to measure if a Book visit occurred by a ‘new’ reader or by a ‘returning’
reader.1 Therefore, we cannot state that 204 Book visits from developing
countries are equal to 204 new readers of that title. If we assume that a
percentage of those Book visits are made by returning readers, the differences in Book visits between titles published in closed access and titles in
open access still convey relevant information on the discovery rate. Further
research is needed to measure the percentage of new versus returning
readers, and whether accessibility influences this.
Hypothesis 2 states that the online usage (i.e. pages read) of fully accessible titles in developing countries is significantly higher, compared to titles
which are not fully accessible. The results of the experiment confirmed the
hypothesis, which is – again – in line with expectations. Online usage is of
course closely linked to the amount of information that is directly available.
It should therefore not come as a surprise that making a book fully accessible
online leads to more pages read. It is interesting to note however, that the
average number of pages read in developed countries is much higher than
in developing countries. Presumably the differences in infrastructure play
an important role here.
The two confirmed hypotheses refer to data at a high aggregation level;
individual countries are not compared for reasons that were discussed
1 According to Google, measured Book visits are done by ‘unique users’. It is not clear if this
means unique within 24 hours, or any other period of time.

earlier: the role of available languages in the data set and the diversity of
subjects. While bias has been removed as much as possible, the data set may
be relatively small. One could consider the contents of the OAPEN Library,
containing hundreds of titles published by dozens of different publishers.
However, this collection does lack a control group, making it harder to draw
conclusions based on its performance. On the other hand, research on freely
accessible books by Hilton and Wiley was done on 41 titles, of which 7 were
non-fiction books. (Hilton, 2011)
In order to enable further research, the data for all 180 titles are made available in http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/images/3336451.0016.103-00000002.

Conclusions

In the introduction, the technical and cultural barriers to the use of open access were discussed. Online access to information resources does require an
infrastructure that supports it. Furthermore, lack of knowledge or cultural
biases may impede the usage of OA. Because of the way this experiment was
set up, these factors do not play a significant role. The technical requirements for finding and using the titles from both the freely accessible group
and the control group were exactly the same: all were available through the
same dissemination channel: the Google Books Search program. Also, all
titles were available in the same time period. The non-technical barriers
may have played a role, but if that was the case their influence would be
the same on all books. As we have seen in the discussion of the selection of
the titles, much effort is placed in the removal of bias. Therefore, the group
of openly accessible books is balanced with the control group.
Research on the effects of free online accessibility of books is scarce,
especially the effects on academic books. As open access is gaining momentum as dissemination model – see for instance the briefing paper of
Knowledge Exchange – there is greater need for knowledge of the effects
it has on all stakeholders, both in developing and in developed countries.
(Knowledge Exchange, 2010) The findings of this article reaffirm the notion that removing barriers to access has positive effects on discovery and
online usages of academic books. This is beneficial for researchers from
both developing and developed countries, and it does indicate that open
access makes it possible to “[…] share the learning of the rich with the poor
and the poor with the rich, [making] this literature as useful as it can be
[…]”. (Chan et al., 2002)

166

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Furthermore, the data used reflects the situation of 2009. As described by
UNESCO, several developing countries are investing heavily in Research and
Development. (UNESCO, 2010) This will impact the discovery and online
usage of academic books, and it will be interesting to see if the digital divide
becomes smaller in the next few years.

9.1

Introduction

While the question whether publishing in open access (OA) leads to a citation advantage has been studied numerous times for journal articles, much
less work has been done in the realm of monographs. This imbalance is
further illustrated by the fact that literature on articles is listed in several
overviews – for instance by Archambault et al. (2014; 2016) or SPARC Europe
(2015) – while publications on monographs are scarce.
The impact of scholarly publications has traditionally been assessed
through citations, and, more recently, altmetrics have come into use as
another type of impact measure. Here, altmetrics are defined as the measurement of online activities about scholarly publications. A specific form
of altmetrics – Twitter mentions – will be used as an indicator of societal
rather than academic impact of scholarly books.
Until recently, books have been largely ignored by those attempting to
measure impact: both in the realm of citations and altmetrics. This paper
will address this lacuna by analysing the role of open access on the impact
of books, based on experimental data.
In 2009, an experiment was conducted on 400 monographs, measuring
the effects of open access on discovery, online consultation, sales figures,
dissemination channels and citations (Snijder, 2010). In line with expectations, the experiment found that making books freely available enhances
discoverability and online consultation. Furthermore, no significant influence on sales could be established. These outcomes are consistent with the
results of other investigations (Ferwerda et al., 2013; Snijder, 2014b).
The experiment was less successful in establishing whether OA enhances
the scholarly impact of books in a more traditional sense: through citations.

168

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Revisiting the experiment will help to answer this question. At the conclusion of the 2009 experiment no citation advantage for freely accessible books
could be found. This is in contrast to journal articles, where higher citation
rates for OA have been frequently reported. In October 2014 citations of the
400 monographs included in the original experiment were measured again,
this time combined with the number of tweets mentioning each book.
In 2009, it was not possible to assess whether making monographs freely
available enhanced scholarly impact, nor could anything be said about
influence on society at large. This paper revisits the experiment, drawing on
additional citation data as well as developments in the altmetrics landscape.
It attempts to answer the following research question: does open access have
a positive influence on the number of citations and tweets a monograph
receives, taking into account the influence of scholarly field and language?
Furthermore, looking into the correlation between monograph citations
and tweets helps to determine whether these measurements are related.

9.2

Background

This review focuses on monographs, starting with monograph citations
before discussing alternative impact metrics as they relate to books. Apart
from availability, two other factors may influence citations and altmetrics
uptake: scholarly field and language. Different citation cultures exist within
individual fields of study, making it hard to compare bibliometrics data
between disciplines without normalisation.1 Furthermore, some authors
suspect a bias towards English language publications in citation databases;
this will be discussed in section The influence of language. The language of
the publications included in the experiment discussed in this paper may
affect its outcomes, as roughly half of the books included in the study – 178
books – are written in English; the remaining 212 books were written in
Dutch or other languages.
Another recurring theme in the literature on OA is the correlation
between citations and altmetrics, see for instance Thelwall et al. (2013). If
altmetrics are closely connected to scholarly impact, one might expect a
statistically significant correlation between them. On the other hand, when
altmetrics are seen as measuring a different type of interest in scholarly
output – rather than as a proxy for citations – it may be more useful to search
1 See for instance section 1.2.3. Normalisation of citation impact indicators of Wouters et al.
(2015)

REV ISITING A N OPEN ACCESS MONOGR A PH EX PERIMENT

169

for online activity relating to scholarly books with the weakest correlation
to citations. In that way, the broadest possible spectrum of engagement with
monographs may be captured. This is discussed further in section What is
the relation between citations and altmetrics?
One of the assumptions of the original 2009 experiment was that making
monographs available in open access enables more researchers to read
books that would otherwise be inaccessible. The results of the experiment
pointed to significantly greater usage – discoverability and online consultation – for freely available books. It was assumed that enhanced access would
also lead to more citations, as it made books available to scholars working
in more restrained environments. This assumption is challenged by the
findings of a survey of 2,231 humanities and social science researchers based
in the United Kingdom: only ten percent of the respondents reported having
difficulties in accessing monographs (OAPEN-UK, 2014).
This perception by researchers opens interesting possibilities. If professional users of monographs have no serious problems in accessing them, we
would expect to find a smaller citation advantage for OA books, or none at
all. However, among the outcomes of the 2010 experiment was the improved
discovery and online consultation of free online books. We might assume
that a significant part of that online usage is coming from readers other
than academics. In the discussion of altmetrics outlets, tweets are strongly
associated with the wider public (Bornmann, 2014; Haustein et al., 2014). For
readers not connected to universities with large library collections, open
access has direct benefits, potentially leading to more mentions on Twitter
and the wider dissemination of research.
The OAPEN-UK project also looked into researchers’ attitudes towards
making their books freely accessible. It concluded that authors see open access publishing as a way to increase their readership, and that this perceived
benefit of open access is valued by many. However, opinions differ about
the way it should be implemented (Collins & Milloy, 2016).
9.2.1

Citations and books

Glänzel & Schoepflin (1999) discussed the differences in citation behaviour
in the humanities and social sciences compared to the sciences. They
matched the percentage of cited articles to citations to books and other
long form publication. In scientific fields such as immunology or solid-state
physics, the number of cited articles is over 85%. In contrast, scholars in the
fields of sociology and history and philosophy of science tend to cite a much

170

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

lower percentage of articles: 40% or lower. In other words: book citations
are strongly linked with the humanities and social sciences.
Several researchers have investigated book citations. Tang (2008) analyses citations of 750 randomly selected monographs in the humanities and
the sciences. Within each discipline, he finds differences in the number of
uncited books, the time span in which half of the citations are occurring,
and the recency of citations. In general, the fields of science tend to have
lower numbers of uncited books and more recent citations compared to
books in the humanities. However, the citation culture within each scholarly field is quite different. Nederhof (2011) deems the results of the impact
investigations more useful, when a “citation window” of at least six to eight
years is used. According to Nederhof, this better reflects the world-wide
reception of the publications. Another factor – not explicitly mentioned
by Nederhof – is the fact that writing a book takes considerable more time
than writing an article. This might have consequences for the citations in
scholarly fields where monographs are the dominant publication form.
Using a longer period to accumulate citations in the field of humanities is
a solution also proposed by Linmans (2009). By doing so, Linmans is able
to assess humanities publications. Furthermore, he expects Google Scholar
to be a very useful source of book citations.
The use of Google Scholar as source of citation data is described by Harzing and Van der Wal. By comparing the coverage in the area of management
and international business by Google Scholar and Thomson ISI Web of
Knowledge, they conclude that Google Scholar is more comprehensive –
especially in the area of books and non US journals (Harzing & van der Wal,
2008). Whether Google Scholar or Google Books fares better than Scopus
citations is tested by Kousha et al. (2011). Based on a set of 1,000 books,
these authors determine that the larger amount of citations by the Google
products could be used for assessing the publications in book-oriented
disciplines in the British humanities and social sciences. More recently,
Prins et al. investigated the coverage of social sciences and humanities by
Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar. They conclude that the coverage
by Google Scholar is better for these scholarly fields, although the quality
of the data is not as consistent as WoS (Prins, Costas, Leeuwen, & Wouters,
2014). In this paper, citations are derived from Google Scholar.
The availability of citation data for monographs is currently not on the
same level as articles: the Thomson Reuters’ Book Citation Index was first
published in 2011, providing citation information relating to a selection of
just 25,000 titles (Jump, 2011). The paucity of citation data relating to books
within the prominent citation databases has inspired several authors to

REV ISITING A N OPEN ACCESS MONOGR A PH EX PERIMENT

171

explore alternative sources of citation information. For instance, Kousha
and Thelwall use the Google Books index to identify citations from books.
Their goal is to compare the number of citations in the Thomson Reuters/
Institute for Scientific Information databases (ISI) to those in Google Books.
It is interesting to note that the ratios strongly differ between scholarly
fields (Kousha & Thelwall, 2009). This is in line with the conclusions of
Nederhof, discussed earlier in this paper. Recently, Thelwall and Sud have
used the Thomson Reuters Book Citation Index (BKCI) to explore whether
co-authorship of monographs leads to a higher citation impact. Contrary
to the results found for articles, the authors conclude that co-operation
does not generally lead to more citations (Thelwall & Sud, 2014). Again, we
see that citation behaviour for monographs differs from journal articles.
9.2.2

Altmetrics

In the document “altmetrics – a manifesto”, altmetrics are described as
an additional dimension to complement citation data. As publications are
made available on the web, usage can be measured immediately (Priem et
al., 2011). The online activities considered within altmetrics frameworks
are diverse: a non-comprehensive list includes blog posts; tweets; Scopus
citations; CiteULike bookmarks; Mendeley references or Facebook posts.
The question of whether altmetrics measure usage from the academic world
or should be treated of an indication of interest from wider reading communities will be discussed in the next section: What is the relation between
citations and altmetrics?
In the realm of monographs and other book-length publications, several
researchers have been working on alternative ways to assess scholarly value.
Perhaps not surprisingly, data from academic libraries is used. For instance,
White et al. discuss ‘libcitations’, where the number of academic libraries
holding a certain book is the unit of measure. The collection of a library
is based on qualitative decisions; a monograph that is acquired by a large
number of libraries has a larger impact compared to a monograph that
only resides in a few libraries. The authors do not compare those metrics
to citation data (White et al., 2009; Zuccala & White, 2015). In contrast,
Cabezas-Clavijo et al. (2013) use the number of library loans from two academic libraries as a proxy of scholarly impact. When the library-generated
data is compared with the available citation data, again the same pattern
emerges: at best a weak correlation between the ‘alternative’ metrics and
citations. Quite a different approach is used by Zuccala et al. (2014), who
use machine-learning techniques to automatically classify the conclusions

172

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

of book reviews in the field of history. However, the reported results derive
from a pilot experiment, and no correlation to citations is described.
The question remains which altmetrics outlet to use to assess monographs. Here we face an additional complication: most altmetrics tools use
an online unique identifier attached to a publication. In the case of journal
articles, this will most likely be the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Books
are usually identified by an ISBN, but the use of ISBNs as digital identifier
is not as widely spread as DOIs. This is especially true for the books in our
data set. Another aspect to consider is the preferred outlet: are mentions
of books evenly spread among all outlets? If that is not the case, which
outlet or outlets are to be measured? Hammarfelt (2014) has compared
the coverage in several online sources of 310 English language articles and
54 books – also written in English – in the field of humanities and social
sciences. He concludes that for books, Twitter delivers the most results.
In order to identify books, the title – or a significant part of the title – has
been used.

What is the relation between citations and altmetrics?

The relation between citations and altmetrics is currently under investigation. If these measurements are strongly correlated, they might measure
something similar. However, if there is no strong connection, can altmetrics
be considered to be an indication of a new aspect of impact? The literature
discussed in this section is focused on journal articles; the connection
between citation, altmetrics and books is poorly researched and there is
little existing literature on the topic.
Several large-scale studies on correlations between citations and altmetrics have been performed. Using a set of over 24,000 open access articles
published in the Public Library of Science, Priem et al. (2012) find a large
uptake in at least one source of altmetrics activity. Yet, the correlation
between citations and altmetrics is not very strong. Costas et al. (2014)
arrive at a different conclusion regarding altmetrics activity: between 15 and
20% of the articles in their set – based on more than 718,000 publications
covered in the Web of Science – are mentioned via an altmetrics outlet,
compared to almost 80% in the case of Priem et al. (2012), who examined
open access articles. Again, they do not find a strong connection between
altmetrics and citations.
After a meta-analysis of seven studies, Bornmann (2014) concludes
that different types of online outlets vary in the amount of correlation
with citation counts. The bookmark counts of online reference managers

Mendeley and CiteULike are the most connected to citations. In contrast,
Twitter citations seem to measure something different from traditional
citations: the correlation with traditional citations for the number of tweets
is negligible. This is also described by Haustein et al. (2014), who conclude
that Mendeley is predominantly used by the academic community, while
Twitter is used by a general audience.
The report by Wouters et al. (2015) provides an overview of the current
literature on the role of citations and altmetrics in research assessment. The
report describes citations and altmetrics as complementary measures which
should be considered within the context of the publication. In a recent
article by Thelwall (2016) the correlation between citations and altmetrics
is also something to be considered within a certain context. Interpreting
the correlation strength is quite complicated, as factors such as the average
and the variability of the number of citations the documents received tend
to play an important – but not always straightforward – role.
9.2.4

Twitter as research tool

Using the number of tweets as an indicator of impact has several advantages
when we look at the research at hand. Twitter is a widely-used platform,
which has been available since 2006. Due to its global usage and the extended period that it has been available for, we might expect more ‘success’
in identifying tweets about the books in our data set. The books in the data
set analysed during this experiment were published between 1995 and 2008.
The relatively long period between the publication of the books studied
and the analysis carried out for this paper conforms to the longer ‘citation
window’ discussed by Nederhof and Linmans. It may also allow for the
accumulation of more tweets, which seems to be the case here. Moreover,
Hammarfelt (2014) describes Twitter as the platform containing the most
mentions of books, compared to other sources of altmetrics data. In the
paper by Hammarfelt, the highest number of tweets for one book was 19.
In our data set, 48 of the 400 books were mentioned in 25 tweets or more.
The results for this paper were derived using a search tool. While Twitter.com has its own search engine, a sample test performed in October
20142 indicated that Topsy.com was more successful in identifying tweets
about the books in the data set. This search engine had indexed all publicly
available tweets, making it a serious alternative to the Twitter.com search

engine (Sterling, 2013). Therefore, Topsy.com was used to identify relevant
tweets for the purposes of this study.
9.2.5

The influence of language

Little research is available on the influence of language on monograph
citations. Abrizah and Thelwall (2014) have investigated – among other
influences – the role of language in the number of citations Malaysian
monographs received. While 71% of the books analysed were published in
Malay and the rest in English, the English language books were significantly
more likely to be cited. Again, the authors have found differences between
the citations in the different scholarly fields. Other researchers investigated
the role of language on the citation rate of articles, by comparing the ‘native’
language to English (Aleixandre-Benavent et al., 2007; Guerrero-Bote &
Moya-Anegón, 2012; Winkmann, Schlutius, & Schweim, 2002). The common factor here is the bias of citation databases towards English, which
disadvantages articles in other languages.
The relationship between language and Twitter usage has also been
investigated. The paper by Hong et al. (2011) reveals the large proportion of
English language tweets in the examined data set of over 62 million tweets.
The number of tweets in English consist of 51% of the total. This may also
affect our outcomes, and we might expect more tweets for books in English,
compared to the books in Dutch.
9.2.6

The influence of subject

Nederhof (2011) describes citation impact measurements in modern language
and linguistics research. Although these fields are closely connected, there
are significant differences in publication and citation behaviour within
each field. Whether the differences in citation patterns is also reflected in
the number of tweets relating to books in different subject fields is not clear.
Holmberg and Thelwall (2014) examined a related question, by looking
at disciplinary differences in how researchers use Twitter. This research
was centred on all the tweets by scientists in ten disciplines. In contrast,
this paper only examines tweets that mention the books in our data set.
Holmberg and Thelwall conclude that differences in Twitter usage exist
between scientific fields: those working on biochemistry, astrophysics,
cheminformatics and digital humanities use it for scholarly communication.
Others, who specialise in economics, sociology and history of science, are
not deploying the microblogging site for their work. No information about

the affiliation of the Twitter users in our data set is available, which makes
it difficult to replicate this type of research.

9.3

Research setup and the data set

The Introduction discussed whether publishing in open access has a significant effect on the scholarly impact of monographs, using citations and
tweets. However, based on the literature review, we might expect additional
influences by the scholarly field and language. Language is an important
factor, as half of the collection analysed in this experiment is in Dutch,
while the other half consists mainly of English language books. The study
attempts to answer the research question, while taking into account these
influences. Furthermore, we might expect a loose correlation between the
number of citations and altmetrics. This is another aspect to be examined
in this paper.
The data set consists of 400 books, all published by Amsterdam University
Press (AUP), in the period 1995 to 2008. In the original experiment the books
were divided into 4 sets of 100 titles (Snijder, 2010). Three sets were immediately made available in open access; the fourth set was used as control
and lacked full online availability. The books in the experimental data set
were made available without embargo. Since the end of the experiment,
the publisher has changed the availability of several books. The changes in
availability since 2009 explain the percentages of OA in our data set: instead
of 75%, 68% of the books are now freely available.
In the data set, 22 different subjects can be identified; in this data set we
will treat the subject of the books as a proxy for scholarly field. The subjects
are not evenly spread over the books: while 25% of the titles discuss public
administration and political science, the combination of the six topics
education, economics, mathematics, theatre, information technology and
religion accounts for just 6% of the books.
In order to create groups of comparable size, the books were placed in
two subject-based groups. Books on the subjects Archaeology, Art - History, Culture, Dutch Language, Education, History, Japan, Law, Literature,
Motion Pictures, Music, Philosophy, Religion, and Theatre were included
in the “Humanities” group. Books on Economics, Information Technology,
Mathematics, Medicine, Psychology, Public Administration and Political
Science, Science, and Sociology were placed in the “Other scholarly field”
group.

Compared to the number of subjects, the number of languages is quite
small. More than half of the data set – 212 books – comprises books published in Dutch; 178 books are published in English, while the remaining
group of ten books are in either German or dual-language English-Dutch
books. For the purposes of this study’s analysis, the books are divided
in English-language titles and titles in other languages. The background
section discussed the role of English; given the fact that only ten of the
remaining books were not written in Dutch, they were not placed in a
separate group.

As mentioned in section Citations and books, the source of citations
chosen for the purposes of this study is the Google Scholar website. In
2009, the citations were measured during the month August; in 2014, the
citations were assessed in October. In the results section of this paper, the
differences in citations will be discussed in more detail.
Most altmetrics tools use online identifiers – such as DOIs – to identify
journal articles. Identifying publications turns out to be more problematic
for monographs, which are more commonly associated with an ISBN. In
contrast to DOIs, ISBNs are not widely used as an online identifier and
searching for tweets using ISBNs did not prove to be successful. In contrast,
searching for tweets using book titles delivered more results. Furthermore,
personal communication with the founder of Altmetric.com has confirmed
that – at the moment of writing – no online identifier for monographs can
be used.3 In other words, a stable online identification was not available.
However, searching for tweets using titles has disadvantages, particularly
in relation to books that have been published in several editions. As far as
could be established, the books in the data sets have not been published
in several editions.

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Apart from availability in open access, language and scholarly field have
also been identified as having a possible impact on the number of tweets
relating to any given title. According to the paper by Hong et al. (2011) half
the tweets of their set containing 62 million tweets are sent in English.
This may affect the number of tweets about books written in English as
well. About half the books in our data set were written in Dutch. We can
assume that these books will be read more by people in Dutch-speaking
countries, while books written in English may attract a more global audience. Secondly, we have seen that within each scholarly field, the citation
patterns are different. Does a comparable divide also exist in the use of
social media? Are some subjects more prone to attract tweets than others?
In our investigation, we will take both language and subject into consideration, combined with open access.
9.3.1

Obtaining citations using Google Scholar

The citations were obtained using the same method as in the original
experiment (Snijder, 2010). For each of the monographs a URL pointing to
a search at Google Scholar was constructed. The URL was based on the main
title, placed between quotes. If needed, parts of the subtitle or the name
of the author were added to ensure a best possible match. For instance, to
find the book Why Are Artists Poor? : The Exceptional Economy of the Arts,
by Hans Abbing, the following URL was used: http://scholar.google.com/
scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22Why+Are+Artists+Poor?%22+The+Exceptional
+Economy. This automatically opens the English language interface of the
Google Scholar website, using the following search query: “Why Are Artists
Poor?” The Exceptional Economy. Using quotes forces the website to search
on the exact phrase; in this case, part of the subtitle was added to narrow
down the results. The resulting number of citations was recorded.
The search was done manually, over several days. Restrictions on the
Google Scholar website limit the number of searches that can be carried
out within a short time. As was the case with searching for tweets, using
the book title instead of the ISBN yielded the best results. The data set for
this paper contains the search queries used on both Google Scholar and
the Topsy.com website.
Each result was examined critically, and when multiple instances of a
title – each containing their ‘own’ number of citations – were found, only
the result with the highest number of citations was used. In the example
below, the number of recorded citations was 25, not 29 (25+2+2). This method
was also used in the experiment carried out in 2009.

9.3.2

Finding tweets using Topsy.com

The method used to find tweets resembles the routine for obtaining citations:
again, the book titles were used in a manual process. In order to narrow down
the results, quotes were used. For instance, the search for “The Rise of the
Cult of Rembrandt” resulted in this URL: http://topsy.com/s?q=%22The%20
Rise%20of%20the%20Cult%20of%20Rembrandt%22. Each query was set
up in this way. If the search was not successful, the quotes were removed
in an attempt to widen the search. All the resulting tweets were examined,
and tweets on other subjects than the book in question were not counted.
As mentioned before, neither ISBN nor another online identifier have been
used. If readers tweeted a link to a book without using the title, this was
not recorded.

9.4

The results

As discussed earlier, this paper engages with the following research question: Does open access have a positive influence on the number of citations
and tweets a monograph receives, taking into account the influence of
scholarly field and language? Additionally, the correlation between the
number of citations and altmetrics activity has previously been investigated
in relation to journal articles. Here, the correlation between monograph
citations and tweets is investigated. Are they connected, or do these figures
describe different aspects of impact?
To get a sense of the way that citations and tweets are distributed across
our data set, frequency has been plotted in two charts below. In both charts,
it is evident that distributions are skewed: most books received between
one and five citations or tweets.

Number of tweets - measured Oct. 2014

The books in our data set were published between 1995 and 2008. The
literature cited in the background section suggested that a ‘citation window’
of six to eight years is preferable when assessing monographs. The effect of a
longer period on the number of citations is clear in our data set. In 2009 – the
period of the original experiment – the average number of citations was 9.0.

181

REV ISITING A N OPEN ACCESS MONOGR A PH EX PERIMENT

In 2014, the average has ascended to 39.0; more than four times as many.
Perhaps more telling is the fact that in 2009, 183 of the 400 books received
no citations. In comparison, the number of titles without citations has
shrunk in 2014 to 67 books, meaning that 83% of the books in the data set
had been cited at least once.
The paper by Thelwall et al. (2013) predicts the opposite effect for altmetrics: due to a rapidly increasing uptake, newer publications will be
mentioned more than older publications. However, Twitter was founded in
2006 – more than a decade after some of the books in the sample examined
for this project were published. Twitter analysis for this project was carried
out in 2014. Although Topsy did capture historical tweets, the gap between
the publication of many of the books in the sample and the advent of Twitter
may partly explain the relatively low percentage of books with at least one
mention on Twitter: 77%.

The literature discussed earlier in this paper not only predicts more
citations from a longer citation window, but it also describes differences in
citation culture. Different citation patterns for different disciplinary areas
are clearly visible in Table 4. The differences are also visible when books are
categorised according to publication language in Table 5. The total number
of citations counted in 2014 includes citations identified during the 2009
study; the column “tweets” lists the total number of tweets in which each
monograph is mentioned.

The literature on language and citations states that publications in
English tend to receive more citations than texts in other languages. This
may be in part because citation databases are more likely to index English
language databases. In this paper, the citation data is not derived from a
database such as Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge, but from Google Scholar.
The sources indexed by Google Scholar are not known, and as such it is
impossible to assess the extent to which Google Scholar citations are biased
towards English language publications.
The influence of language – and the dominance of English – in relation
to Twitter usage has also been discussed. In our data set, English language
books are mentioned 13.2 times on average, while the average for books in
other languages is far lower. Based on this, it seems reasonable to assume
that the higher mean for English language books could partly be explained
by the number of tweets in English. 4
9.4.1

Analysis of citations and tweets

To assess the relation between open access, language and subject, the
data gathered has been analysed using a generalised linear model (GLM)
analysis – in this case a negative binomial regression analysis. This type
of statistical investigation allows for response variables that have error
distribution models other than a normal distribution. We have seen that the
distributions of both citations and tweets do not follow a neat ‘bell curve’,
but are severely skewed. The GLM analysis is used to quantify the strength
of the effect of the factors on the number of citations. Here, the factors are
accessibility, language and scholarly field.

The dataset used does not record the language of the tweets.

9.4.1.1 Citations
The average number of citations for books published in OA was 35.7 (SD =
174.4); the mean number of citations for books not made available in OA
was 13.4 (SD = 36.6). For the total set, the mean number of citations was 30.9
(SD = 157.44). Based on this, we might conclude that making books freely
available has a large positive effect on the number of citations. If no further
statistical analysis is deployed, the conclusion could be that the experiment
has produced the expected result. This is also supported by the results of
a negative binomial (maximum likelihood estimate) regression analysis.
The estimated effect size Exp (B) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) is
listed in Table 6. If only accessibility is taken into consideration, making
books available in open access leads to 2.6 more citations (8%)5 on average,
compared to those published in closed access.

However, when the effects of language and scholarly field are analysed,
the results are more nuanced. Table 7 lists the results. When controlled for
language and scholarly field, making a book freely available leads to 1.7
(5%) more citations on average. However, the ‘citation advantage’ for books
in English is 3.5 (11%) and books in the humanities receive 0.5 citations
on average (2%), compared to books on other scholarly fields. The results
still point to a slightly positive influence of open access on the number of
citations, but the effects of language and scholarly field are also significant.

5 Throughout section 4, the average number of citations/tweets of that data set is used as
reference.

7.6 (SD = 14.6). For the total set, the average number of tweets was 7.86 (SD
= 16.044). Again, at a first glance we see an advantage for OA books and we
might be tempted to conclude that publishing monographs in open access
leads to a higher uptake by social media, in this case Twitter. Nevertheless,
this conclusion is refuted by the results of a negative binomial (maximum
likelihood estimate) regression: when only open access is considered, the
results are not statistically significant.

Based on the literature, we might expect that both subject and language
are significant factors, whether or not the books have been made available in
open access; if different scholarly fields have different citation cultures, this
should affect the outcomes. The results point to the same effect on tweets.
Yet, we could argue that analysing citations from different scholarly fields is
comparing apples and oranges: within each discipline, the average number
of citations is different. This may have impacted the results of the analysis.
In order to compensate for discipline variance, it is necessary to compare
the number of citations and tweets within a group of books with the same
subject. The results of this analysis are described in the next section.
9.4.2

Statistical analysis within subject

The books in the data set are not evenly distributed across subjects. While
98 books discuss the subject “Public Administration and Political Science”,
there are also groups of just three or four books on subjects such as “Economics”, “Mathematics”, “Theatre” or “Religion”.

186

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

If the mean number of citations and tweets are plotted on a chart, the
differences become visible in a literal sense: the mean number of citations
differs between scholarly fields, and a high number of mean citations is
not matched by a high number of tweets. The chart also lists the number
of books per subject. Whether the results of analysing subject-based groups
containing as little as four or three books have any statistical significance
is highly doubtful.

number of books in the five largest subject-based groups is quite large: 238

The results of the citation analysis based on the five subjects are mixed.
In the case of the books on “Literature” and “Sociology”, neither accessibility
nor language are statistically significant. Language is a significant factor for
“Public Administration and Political Science” and “Motion Pictures”. Only
for “History”, open access was a statistically relevant factor.
The results of the tweet analysis based on the five subjects follow a
different pattern compared to citations. Here, neither accessibility nor
language were statistically significant for “Public Administration and Political Science”, “Literature” and “Motion Pictures”. Language is a significant
factor for “Sociology”, and – as is the case with citations – accessibility is
significant for “History”.
Taking these results into account, the conclusion must be that open access does not affect significantly the number of tweets relating to a specific
title. However, the influence of language is also limited. Again, the data set
is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.17026/dans-x6m-67b2.
9.4.3

Correlating citations and tweets

The background section of this paper describes work by Priem et al. (2012)
and by Costas et al. (2014), in which correlation analysis was used to test
for a connection between the number of citations associated with journal
articles and altmetrics activity. Of course, correlation is not causation and
a connection between citations and altmetrics does not imply such a simple

188

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

relation. However, a strong correlation may suggest an underlying cause.
Both papers reported a weak but positive correlation between citations
and altmetrics activity. In other words, when citations are higher, there is
a small chance that altmetrics activity will also be higher.
Haustein et al. (2014) link Twitter to a general audience. The altmetrics
data in this paper consists of Twitter data, and we might expect only a weak
correlation between citations and tweets. In other words: the measured
usage of scholarly output – for which the number of citations is used as a
proxy – might differ considerably from the interest expressed by the general
public – for which the number of tweets is used as a proxy. Lastly, Figure 3
shows the differences in mean citations and tweets for books with the same
subject. This also is an indication of a weak correlation.
A Spearman’s correlation has been computed to determine the relationship between the number of citations and tweets in the data set. There was
a moderate, positive correlation between citations and tweets (rs = .299,
n = 400, p < .001). While keeping in mind the uncertainties described by
Thelwall (2016), this result is consistent with the idea that there is not much
overlap between academic usage and the interest of a general audience.

9.5

Conclusions

The 2009 monograph experiment was set up to measure the influence of
open access using several indicators. During the nine months the experiment ran, it became clear that discovering and consulting the books online
benefits strongly from open access. According to the literature on journal
article citations and open licenses, a positive influence on monograph citations should have been expected. However, the effect did not occur in 2009.
Five years later, the freely accessible books had been cited more on average
compared to the control group; a result that confirms the hypothesis that
open access has an effect on citations. Yet, when statistical analyses are
deployed, the results are more nuanced: when differences in language and
subject were controlled for, a small positive effect of OA publishing on
citation scores remained.
One of the propositions of making scholarly documents freely available
is that it widens access, including for academics who would otherwise not
be able to read them. From this follows the assumption that more academic
readers will eventually cite the document in their own work. The 2009
experiment demonstrated that online usage benefits from open access, but
this usage did not result in more citations. Measuring citations five years

REV ISITING A N OPEN ACCESS MONOGR A PH EX PERIMENT

189

later allowed for the longer time period associated with writing books,
which are still a major publication form in the humanities and social sciences. The number of citations measured in 2014 revealed a slight citation
advantage for open access books.
A possible explanation can be found in the results of the OAPEN-UK
survey of British scholars. Most of the respondents declared that they had
little trouble in accessing relevant books, either by borrowing or buying
them. Here at least is no indication of diminished access to monographs.
As the most likely readers of Dutch language monographs, scholars in the
Netherlands and Belgium might work under comparable conditions with
relative easy access to academic libraries or funds to purchase books. If that
is the case, the significance of free access to online books becomes smaller,
although open access might still enhance access.
This study found a similar relationship between open access, subject and
language on altmetrics activity associated with books. In the case of OA
monographs, making them freely available had a clear positive effect on
usage: the free books were used more when compared to a control group of
books that are not available in open access. This higher usage has translated
into a higher uptake in social media, although the effects of subject and
language again played an important role. However, the higher uptake for
freely accessible books is not statistically significant.
The results identified very little overlap between Twitter usage and citation behaviour; it seems reasonable to hypothesise that the factors affecting
citations of books do not play a significant role in tweets about books.
Therefore, the probable reason that open access is a significant influence
on book citations does not necessarily apply to Twitter mentions. Nonetheless, it is possible to conclude that making books freely available has some
positive impact on the number of tweets. Lowering the access barrier does
indeed lead to more attention, in line with the effects for discoverability
and online consultation found in the 2009 experiment.
The results also point to the fact that barriers to access are not the only
reason for lack of attention. Within the formalized realm of scholarly
discourse, the mean number of citations tends to be closely connected to
the scholarly discipline. The mean number of tweets per discipline does not
follow the same pattern, but there are certainly subjects which are more
popular than others. Books on literature, motion pictures or history of art
receive a higher number of tweets on average, compared to subjects like
history, sociology or law. In other words, the impact of subject should be
filtered out, before the effect of open access can be measured.

190

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Apart from subject, language is another factor. This plays a large role in
determining the number of both citations and tweets. Publishing books in
languages other than English does not only affect usage by scholars, but
also the uptake on Twitter. The latter is easily explained by the current
preference for English as lingua franca, but also by the fact that scholars
are less likely to give attention to other languages. Whether this result is
specific to this data set only – because it includes a large portion of Dutch
language books – or whether the same result would be found in collections
containing a different mix of languages remains to be seen.

9.6

Further investigation: beyond the OA citation adsvantage?

This paper attempts to shed light on the effects of open access on books,
rather than on journal articles. The paper has identified that the effect
of OA is not as profound for books as it appears to be for journal articles,
and that further examination of differences between books and journal
articles is warranted. An area of particular interest for future research is
whether the slower publication cycle associated with books changes the
effect of open access, or whether other factors such as disciplinary culture
are responsible for apparent differences.
Another way of looking at the results might be that the OA citation
advantage exists, both for articles and books. This has been demonstrated
in the case of journal articles again and again. However, more research
on the effects of OA on monographs would be welcome, as the amount of
published research in this area is small. Still, more interesting questions
can be asked.
For instance, if open access helps to disseminate scholarly publications
beyond the more affluent academic organisations, will citations and altmetrics reflect this? In other words: will freely available publications be
cited more often by scholars working in less privileged circumstances? Or
does open access only favour those who would have access anyway? This
question could also be investigated through the lens of altmetrics, with a
view to establishing whether or not the altmetrics indicators measured are
associated with a wider, more global audience.
Earlier in the paper the connection between citation and altmetrics
behaviour was discussed. While directly interrogating the reasons for citations or online activities is a complex challenge, this is also an important
direction for future research. Understanding whether there are differences
between the ways in which research communities perceive OA documents

REV ISITING A N OPEN ACCESS MONOGR A PH EX PERIMENT

191

when compared to closed equivalents may shed light on differences in
altmetrics and citation profiles.
Lastly, if the importance of bibliometric analysis as a proxy for research
quality is growing, it is vital to understand if there are significant dissimilarities between articles and monographs. Identifying specific differences
between journal articles and books and the factors that underlie these
differences will enable a comparison of scholarly impact of monographs
and articles based on sound principles.

9.7

Limitations

For the purposes of this study tweets referring to book titles were identified
through the altmetrics search engine – Topsy.com. The limitations of the
Topsy search engine are not known. Furthermore, searching for a book’s
title may be an imperfect way to find all mentions, due to a lack of online
identifiers for monographs.
The method used to collect tweets was geared towards quantitative
results: apart from removing tweets on subjects other than the book in
question, no attempt was made to analyse the content of individual tweets.
Whether authors actively participated in the promotion of their books via
social media is not known. However, the author of this paper was employed
at Amsterdam University Press from 2007-2014. During that period, no
formal policy existed for promoting publications by authors using social
media.
Within the analysis, factors other than language and subject were not
been corrected for. For instance, the role of document length or publisher’s
prestige were not accounted for.

Conclusions

10.1

Introduction

The deliverance of open access monographs is a complex process. It is based
on the actions of many different stakeholders, who have invested time,
money and other resources in order to make academic books freely available
online. The monographs are disseminated through several platforms, which
are part of a larger online ecosystem containing search engines, library
catalogues, social media platforms and many more components. Potentially,
everyone who is connected to the internet can access the books. The new
technical possibilities enabled publishers and funders to offer online collections, while empowering librarians and authors to publish books.
In this dissertation, the usage of open access monographs is seen as
an indication of success. However, the actions of the stakeholders, the
complexities of the online ecosystem and properties of the monographs
could all affect the usage. To simplify the discussion, I will first discuss the
properties of academic books that are not related to online dissemination. In
this way, it is possible to make a distinction between aspects that are tied to
the concept of the book – whether published in digital or paper form – and
the aspects that are connected to the virtual realm. For instance, language
is an aspect of the book that affects the usage on online platforms: books in
other languages than English are mostly used by native speakers.
I assume that the content of the monograph is created independently of
its appearance: the paper version of the book contains the same information
as the online version.1 This assumption has an important consequence: the
changes brought on by open access consist largely of adjustments in the
online infrastructure. The development of new platforms such as institutional repositories, Google Books, the OAPEN Library etc. are examples of
such changes. The performance of these platforms depends partly on their
technical specifications, partly on the books themselves.
In the majority of cases, up until the moment the book is ready for
publication, the workflow is still firmly grounded in the traditions of the
print era; see for example Springer’s workflow (Springer, 2017). For some
1 There are exceptions to this rule. An example is the book “Vincent van Gogh – The Letters”
and the accompanying website http://vangoghletters.org.

194

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

authors, the new possibilities offered by digital publishing could be used
to critically engage with the current publication model. Alonso et al. (2003)
discuss abandoning the print model in favour of the digital possibilities.
Hall (2013) is going even further by questioning the concept of the book
itself. Instead of a bound entity, the ‘new’ book is in constant flux: updated
through the engagement of researchers and others. At this moment, most
books – digital or not – are still a far cry from this vision: a stable text-based
publication, consisting of chapters and pages (Carmody, 2011). For now,
the current online publication form is basically a digitized version of the
paper copy; the same holds true for most journal articles, which also did
not change in a significant way (Ware & Mabe, 2015).
Throughout this dissertation, books are considered to be stable objects,
which are not inherently changed by open access dissemination. Several
aspects of the book, however, will affect online dissemination. Two aspects
have been examined in the previous chapters: language and subject. A third
aspect is more implicit: quality in connection to trust. In this concluding
chapter I will look in more detail at quality and trust, after a short discussion
of language and subject.
The influence of language on dissemination is profound. An author
who wants to reach a global audience needs to publish in English. Any
other language than English will mainly attract a “local” audience, such as
Germany, Austria and Switzerland in the case of German language books,
or the Netherlands and Belgium when Dutch language books are on offer.
This can be inferred from chapters 6 and 7. This bias towards English also
extends to citation indexes, a topic that will be discussed in section 10.5.
In this dissertation, the subject matter of a book is used as a proxy for
scholarly discipline. The scholarly discipline’s influence can be found in two
areas: dissemination and assessment. In short, subject defines the audience:
most of those who are interested in film and media studies are not trying
to acquire expertise in the field of archaeology. Bibliometric methods such
as citation counts can be seen as a form of assessment. For the humanities
and social sciences, this is not without problems (Nederhof, 2006; Ochsner
et al., 2017). For instance, each scholarly discipline has different citation
practices; which is visible in section 10.5.2. In addition, the results of chapter
9 seem to suggest differences in Twitter mentions per scholarly discipline.
Scholarly research is diverse. Ochsner et al. (2017) provide a useful summary of common characteristics. Research in the humanities and social
sciences might attempt to accumulate knowledge in the same linear fashion
as the natural sciences, or it might be focused on interpreting and reflecting
on existing phenomena, such as texts and theories in the humanities and

CONCLUSIONS

195

concepts in the social sciences. In other words, instead of striving towards
one definitive answer, it tries to create new perspectives and thus works
with competing visions. The researched phenomena can be local, such as
the history of a specific region. This also leads to the use of ‘local’ languages,
instead of English.
The diversity in research practices is also reflected in citation culture and
quality assessment: each scholarly discipline has different norms whether
a publication has sufficient quality. However, consensus exists about one
aspect: a publication’s quality should not be solely determined by the author.
Sufficient quality can only be determined by the author’s peers. Both the
Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (2010) and Ochsner et
al. (2012) conclude that quality is best assessed by researchers in the same
field, assisted by additional indicators. One of those indicators could be the
prestige of the publisher of monographs, as discussed by Giménez-Toledo
& Román-Román (2009).
The notion of research quality is determined to a large extent by the
scholars within a discipline. Additionally, funders and publishers play a part
as well. Funding agencies can influence the research agenda by deciding
which research – or scholar – receives subsidy. Moreover, when the role of
funding agencies also encompasses publishing open access content – for
instance by demanding an open publication license or by using an open
access platform – they directly shape the publishing landscape. Publishers
play a similar role by deciding whether to accept a manuscript, and by
enabling dissemination through open access channels.
Related to the quality of the publications is the issue of trust. Most readers
and the libraries and aggregators that act on their behalf will validate the
online books on offer. Do they have confidence in the book and the platform
it resides on? For instance, when an author publishes a monograph on a
personal website, will it reach the same level of usage compared to the same
book published on the publisher’s website? Intermediaries such as academic
libraries might place more trust in the publisher’s offering (Moghaddam &
Moballeghi, 2007). Another aspect of specialised platforms is their optimisation towards online usage. Not just search engine optimisation, but also by
offering services to the intended audiences.
In conclusion, quality assessments directly affect the dissemination
of open access books, through the combined actions of the stakeholders.
Some groups may act as gatekeepers, strongly affecting the diffusion of
books. This is illustrated in chapter 5, where listing titles in the Directory
of Open Access Books (DOAB) enhances usage. Before the launch of DOAB,
all titles in the OAPEN Library saw comparable levels of usage. When a

196

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

set of titles were listed in DOAB – purely based on the licence and not on
the contents or the quality of the books – their usage soared compared to
the unlisted titles. It seems more than likely that intermediaries accepted
DOAB as a valid source, resulting in additional exposure. For instance,
the growth of DOAB is listed in the “Dramatic growth of open access” blog
(Morisson, 2016). This is further illustrated by McCollough (2017), who sees
the Directory of Open Access Books as a tool for discovering open access
monographs in academic libraries.
In a sense, the dissemination of books is the final phase of the publication cycle. However, publishing monographs is financially challenging
and in section 10.3 I discuss my research on the economic sustainability of
a specific model: hybrid publishing. Open access books are disseminated
using several platforms, and section 10.4 discusses the optimisation of the
infrastructure. After the books have been disseminated, the question arises
how to evaluate the results. My answers can be found in section 10.5.

10.2

Web based data sets and data providers

In this section, I will briefly discuss some properties of the analysed data
sets. With the exception of the data set of chapter 3, the data have been
selected using the web. Collecting data in a web environment is almost by
definition automated, eliminating manual procedures and enabling the
creation of large data sets in a relative effortless way. However, it also poses
challenges. As the environment changes constantly, the gathered data is
strongly connected to a certain period in time. For example, the estimated
number of websites in 2010 was 200 million, in 2017 the number grew to over
1.7 billion (“Total number of Websites - Internet Live Stats,” n.d.). This is also
true for the OAPEN Library itself: the number of titles grew from slightly
over 850 titles in 2011 to 2,300 books in 2014. In July 2018, the collection
comprises almost 5,500 titles. Not just the number of titles increased, also
the number of users and the number of book downloads, leading to possible
changes in interaction: changes in user’s countries; changes in providers
and aggregators; changes in the collection’s subjects and languages.
On top of this, online tools change or disappear. The data gathered for
chapter 8 is based on geographical data provided by Google Books; since
2012, this platform has stopped offering this type of data. The research
on monograph citations of chapter 9 is based on Google Scholar. In the
year after that research was completed, Google Scholar decided to index
the contents of the OAPEN Library (Pinter, 2015). Whether this affects the

CONCLUSIONS

197

number of citations found, is not known. The same chapter also used the
services of the Topsy search engine to find tweets. The Topsy.com service
has been discontinued in December 2015. Thus, replicating the research
on a later date is hardly possible. This is a known problem that affects all
researchers working with web based data.
The data sets can be divided in three groups. The data of chapter 3
consists of the sales data of all books published under the same imprint
by Amsterdam University Press. The data of chapter 4 to 7 is based on the
logged usage data of the OAPEN Library, combined with the metadata
describing the books and – where applicable – the added metadata describing the providers. Here, the selection of books is based on all books that
were part of the collection during the period under scrutiny. In contrast,
the data sets of chapter 8 and 9 are based on a curated and much smaller
selection of books. Here, the experimental set and the control set are chosen
carefully to remove bias. The data to be analysed is derived from web based
platforms: Google Books, Google Scholar and Topsy.com.
When the size of the data sets is compared to the sets used in bibliometric
research – for instance in Costas et al. (2014); Thelwall et al. (2013) – the
number of titles is small. Also, the data has mostly been derived from one
platform: the OAPEN Library. This might lead to a certain amount of bias.
Yet, even the smallest data set is based on nearly 200 books, which are
selected carefully to remove bias. The larger data sets are based on hundreds
of titles, published by dozens of publishers, spanning multiple subjects and
several languages. On top of that, the influence of language and subject is
analysed separately from the possible effects of open access. Comparing
usage data from other platforms would be a good way to enhance our understanding, but comes with its own challenges: differences in infrastructure,
collection or definitions of usage must all be accounted for.
I have applied several analytical techniques to the different datasets. In
numerous occasions, I applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine
whether the influence of one of more aspects of the books or the book’s users
is more than coincidental. In order to produce reliable outcomes, the values
in the data set must be distributed normally; the so-called “bell curve”.
When the values are out of kilter compared to a normal distribution – which
is the case in chapter 9 – I have used the generalised linear model (GLM).
The most recent research – described in chapter 6 – was based on social
network analysis, combined with a clustering algorithm. The conclusions
derived from these analyses will be discussed in more detail in the next
sections.

Economic sustainability

Books are the result of a network of organisations and individuals working
together. This network has to be economically sustainable. However, the
economic sustainability of monographs has been problematic for decades,
long before the advent of open access book publishing. The introduction of
chapter 3 describes falling print runs, declining sales and shrinking budgets
in academic libraries.
When financing books in a commercial setting is far from easy, how
are the costs met if the books are made available for free? What business
model can be applied? Publishing monographs in open access could be
seen as a “system break” (Pochoda, 2013) or a transition from print-only to
digital – mostly in combination with printed books. According to Adema
& Ferwerda (2014), this opens new possibilities: increased dissemination,
combined with new possibilities to search the contents of collections of
books. However, in order to reach this state of affairs it is necessary to find
a business model that works.
Several business models for academic books have been discussed in
the literature. Greco & Wharton (2008) recommend looking into a model
optimized for open access books, combined with a print on demand system,
for those who still prefer a paper version of the book. The search for new
business models is also described by Withey et al. (2011), who are investigating how to preserve the best elements of the current publishing system in
a new era of open access monographs. There are numerous other business
models, ranging from a hybrid publication model to crowd-funding (Ferwerda, 2014). Recently, Knöchelmann (2017) discussed the open access book
market, tying successful upscaling to funding.
Within the direct sphere of influence of the OAPEN Library and the
Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB), different business models are used.
For instance, the French organisation OpenEdition – which makes titles
available via DOAB – offers a “freemium” package to libraries: a combination
of a basic version of a publication that is freely available online, combined
with paid-for premium services (Mounier, 2011). Knowledge Unlatched is
another example, using a model based on the cooperation with university
libraries. It establishes a library consortium that pays a “Title Fee” to a group
of publishers. In return, the publishers offer print copies to member libraries
at a discount and also make the books available in open access. One of the
deployed platforms is the OAPEN Library (Pinter, 2012).
Very few papers can be found on the costs of producing monographs. The
costs of creating a – paper only – monograph by an American university

CONCLUSIONS

199

press is discussed by Wasserman (1998). Roughly speaking, the costs of
around $24,000 are not met by the expected sales: depending on the edition,
the losses range between $8,000 and $13,000. A more recent investigation
by Ferwerda et al. (2013) looked into the publication costs of Dutch monographs publishing. Based on the budgets of 50 books the average costs for
publishing a monograph in the Netherlands was found to be slightly over
€12,000. And finally, Maron et al. (2016) examined the publication costs of
20 American publishers in 2014. The average costs of a digital monograph
ranged from $30,000 to $49,000. Whether each amount is based on the same
cost structure is unknown. Recently, Pinter (2018) explains that comparing monograph publications costs is problematic, due to the diversity of
publishers.
It is doubtful whether the economic sustainability of monographs is
guaranteed by the sales of paper copies, and the literature on costs seems
to suggest that a substantial amount of money is needed to produce an
academic book. In such circumstances, will open access publishing have a
positive monetary effect?
Chapter 2 offered some further insight into the economic effects of open
access monograph publishing, by examining the effects of a hybrid business
model. In such a model, paper copies of books are sold, while an online
version is also made available for free. The main assumption is that the
open access version of the title acts as an “advertisement”: when the reader
has discovered the book online, this will possibly lead to the purchase of
the paper version, as many readers still have a strong preference for the
paper codex. As a counterargument, one might argue that paper books
are not a necessity in the era of e-book readers and high-quality tablets.
The main question is thus whether the hybrid business model enhances
or diminishes sales.
The data underlying chapter 3 does not come from a controlled environment, such as described in Snijder (2010). Instead, it examines sales data
obtained from a “normal” business setting: sales data from Amsterdam
University Press obtained in the period 2010 to 2012. While the publisher
uses the hybrid business model – selling paper copies alongside online
open access versions – the commercial expectations for the open access
titles differ from the closed access titles. This can be inferred from the
print run: a higher print run indicates a higher expectation of number of
copies sold. The average print run of books published in closed access was
much higher, compared to the open access titles. Apart from commercial
potential, the moment of sales is also an important factor: most copies are
sold in the first year of publication.

200

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Chapter 3 set out to measure the influence of open access on monograph
sales. Furthermore, the effect of open access was compared to other influences on monograph sales: commercial potential, front list and back list,
and language. Each influence is statistically relevant, making it harder to
single out the effects of open access. The difference in number of copies
sold in the first year – the front list – compared to the number of copies sold
in the subsequent years – the back list – is striking: the mean sales in the
first year is about five times larger than the year after that. Consequently,
I analysed the front list sales and the back-list sales separately.
The results of the front list sales can be explained by a combination of
commercial potential and language; open access publishing does not have
an effect in this situation. The results for the back list are similar to the front
list outcomes. The influence of language was not statistically relevant, and
open access publishing is a relevant influence on sales in certain cases only:
the subsets of books whose print run is between 1 and 2000. The resulting
average number of copies sold seems to point to a small advantage for the
closed access titles. Whether the advantage of closed access published books
is economically relevant, is questionable. Over 65% of all copies sold were
open access titles.
In the debate on the economic sustainability, the small differences in the
number of copies sold are not the main issue. In all discussed experiments
open access did not have a large effect on monograph sales, positive nor
negative. At the start of this section, I mentioned the problems in the book
trade, and I have found that the hybrid model does not lead to more sales.

10.4

Factors affecting dissemination

So far, I have discussed the aspects of the books which remain stable in
a paper and a digital environment and the financial fundament under
monograph publishing. The next aspect to explore is online dissemination.
The distribution of open access monographs consists of two parts: a digital
collection and the means of dissemination. In the previous chapters, several
platforms were introduced: institutional repositories, publisher’s collections, the Google Books platform, the OAPEN Library and the Directory
of Open Access Books (DOAB). Some aspects of this non-exhaustive list
will be summarized in this section, as an illustration of the open access
monographs infrastructure.
Each platform has its own affordances. For instance, disseminating books
via an institutional repository may underline the relation with the hosting

CONCLUSIONS

201

organisation. The Google Books platform enables different things: besides
being directly linked to the Google search engine, it allows rights owners
precise control over how much of the book is made visible to the public.
A platform such as the OAPEN Library is optimized for disseminating OA
books via several channels. The Directory of Open Access Books only stores
metadata, but amplifies the use of the titles listed.
Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of platforms is vital for
choosing a dissemination strategy. Online dissemination platforms shape
what the readers can do with the book, which affects its usage. The usage
data generated by the platform can be used to assess the impact of the
books on the platform, an idea investigated by Herb et al. (2010) and in the
previous chapters. What a platform is capable of, is decided by its owner.
Each owner will have different preferences, leading to a landscape of various possibilities. To illuminate the differences, I will shortly discuss the
platforms and their owners.
Institutional repositories are based on a set of standards promoting
interoperability. Each repository should be able to connect to other repositories and use its content. They could be seen as a natural extension
of academic libraries: in most cases the library will manage the repository.
Other platforms are also used within the library community: some librarians
make a part of their collection searchable through Google Books (“Library
Partners – Google Books,” n.d.). Platforms such as the OAPEN Library or
DOAB are also used as a source for OA books. Apart from academic libraries,
some funding institutions may choose to directly deploy repositories or
comparable platforms. For instance, the Austrian science fund FWF directly
places books in the OAPEN Library (Snijder, 2015). Others, for instance the
Spanish National Research Council, have chosen to set up an institutional
repository (Bernal, 2013).
Some publishers – for example Brill or ANU Press – have made a collection of books available on their website. Setting up a bespoke platform
enables publishers to control what data to collect about the users. Some
people will argue that knowing more about the people active on a platform
solely benefits the platform owner. A recent example is the speculation by
Kelty (2016) about the motives of Elsevier to purchase the SSRN platform:
SSRN’s data can be used as a means to evaluate scholars; to be sold to
university administrators. The question of privacy is discussed further in
chapter 6: how to balance the privacy of the readers versus the desire to
know the “customer” in detail? A publisher might also use other platforms
to distribute open access books online: Google Books, OAPEN Library or
DOAB.

202

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Strictly speaking, the Google Books platform is not an open access
platform. It is a search engine that contains and indexes books, which
also allows the rights owner to decide how much of the book’s contents is
publicly visible. This feature enables publishers to fully open up a book if
desired. Controlling the visibility of the book’s content can be used to set
up experiments in which a set of books with a limited amount of visible
content is compared to a collection of books where all pages were visible
(Snijder, 2010). However, publishers and libraries do not control the platform,
and the platform’s owners decisions may not always suit them. For instance,
since 2015 no new publishers are allowed to sign up to the Google Book
platform (S. Hall, 2016).
The platforms differ in capabilities, but also in content. Each platform
strives to maximise its use – at least within its target audience – and a
major factor is the quality of the offering. Thus, I assume that each platform
will select suitable titles and refuse inappropriate ones. What is a suitable
collection will be different for each platform: institutional repositories and
publisher’s platforms will be limited to their organisations; the OAPEN
Library and DOAB collect titles from different publishers but emphasize
quality assurance of the titles; the Google Books platform attempts to keep
pirated books from their collection.
Maintaining a trusted platform might also be a strategic advantage for
the hosting organisations. For publishers, it may be a way to directly sell
copies to readers – cutting out the middle man. For academic libraries,
it may be a way to strengthen their position within the university, and a
possible counterweight to the influence of publishers. In the case of large
commercial organisations, the platform may be part of other offerings. The
success of Google depends at least partly on knowing the preferences of
their users. The kind of information gathered may lead to privacy concerns.
This conflict of interests has been discussed in more detail in chapter 6.
Open access book platforms are still a relative new phenomenon. What
aspects are important for the dissemination of open access books? In the
next section, I will discuss several of these aspects.
10.4.1 What works in digital dissemination?
The research in the previous chapters is based on experiments, carried
out on several platforms. Most experiments have taken place using the
OAPEN Library. The OAPEN Library has been operational since 2010,
making it one of the longest running open access monograph platforms.
It has several properties that help examine the influences on the usage of

CONCLUSIONS

203

monographs. Firstly, its collection of several thousand books contains large
groups of books in several languages, especially English, German, Dutch
and Italian. Furthermore, the collection spans a broad range of subjects.
The monographs are not only available through the OAPEN interface,
but – through availability of metadata and agreements with commercial
and non-commercial aggregators – are also directly accessible via library
catalogues and other platforms. Due to the fact that the platform has been
operational for several years, trends over longer periods can be examined.
The diversity in licences is another factor that can be studied. Lastly, the
books made available on this platform have been vetted through a peer
review process.
Before, I have discussed economic sustainability as a basic requirement
for disseminating open access books. Now I will look into another aspect
affecting the distribution of open access monographs: dissemination channels. Online dissemination contains more than placing documents on a
website, hoping they will magically turn up prominently in the results of
search engines. Instead, it is necessary to use the channels that are best
suited for the targeted audience. Until recently, in the literature on open
access, dissemination channels seem to be a given. If it is discussed at all,
dissemination is described as making papers available in an institutional
repository.
In chapter 4, the success rate of two dissemination modes has been
examined: the OAPEN website acting as an Online Public Access Catalogue
(OPAC), and direct access where the reader directly downloads the book
without searching the website. A “direct” download implies that the reader
has used other means to find and select the book. The direct search channel
is based on metadata only, which is incorporated into systems outside
the OAPEN Library. The usage data obtained comes from three channels:
through the website only; a combination of website and direct downloads; or
downloads only. The data is analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively
in chapter 4. The quantitative analysis reveals a large difference between
the number of books that were downloaded without searching the OAPEN
website and the other dissemination channels: 73 % of all downloads can
be attributed to ‘direct’ downloads. The results of the qualitative analysis
are not so easy to interpret: the provider’s characteristics nor the properties
of the books were statistically significant.
The books were downloaded through providers, which I categorised
in two ways: the type of provider and the state of their country’s internet
infrastructure. This categorisation was introduced in chapter 7, which
will be discussed later. The question is whether a connection between

204

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

the provider category and dissemination channel exists. Regardless of the
channel, most of the usage comes from three types of provider: academic,
internet service providers (ISP’s) and ISP’s from a country with a highly
developed internet infrastructure.
The state of development of a country’s internet infrastructure does not
affect which dissemination channel is used. However, the digital divide is
clearly visible in the smaller usage from the countries with a less-developed
internet infrastructure compared to the small group of better equipped
countries. Lastly, the subject or language of the downloaded books did not
affect the usage of the channels.
A possible explanation for the large percentage of direct downloads can
be found in the theoretical models on the use of innovations. Whether or
not a new system is used depends on several aspects, such as its fit with
existing usage patterns, perceived ease of use and social norms. It is possible
that most users prefer their ‘own’ systems, with which they are familiar and
which are part of their routine and environment. In that case, learning to
use a new interface may not be seen as a worthwhile investment.
The high percentage of direct downloads – over 70% of all book
downloads – cannot be fully explained by search engine optimisation, as
only 30% of the internet traffic to the OAPEN Library during that period
originated from search engines. This means that a sizable portion originated
from other types of websites. The only way to directly download the books
is by using a specific download address. Those addresses are distributed
by the OAPEN Library, through its metadata feeds. When other systems
or websites incorporate the web addresses that enable direct downloads
of books, they act as aggregators. While I did not examine this, it is likely
that some websites only display a portion of the collection. An example is
the Ancient World Online blog (Jones, n.d.), which lists only monographs
about the Antiquities Period.
Before, I stated that the success of open access publishing depends on
many stakeholders. The main purpose of open access is to make knowledge
available, and it is useful to investigate the factors that enhance dissemination. The results of chapter 4 reveal an important aspect of open access
dissemination: enabling incorporation into other systems enhances
the monograph usage. Here, the solution offered by the OAPEN Library
is providing metadata to be used by aggregators. While the metadata is
available to all, a relative small portion of usage can be attributed to search
engines. The indexation by search engines is an automated process, but
the incorporation of the metadata into other systems – which aggregate
information for readers – is the result of a conscious decision. I conclude

CONCLUSIONS

205

that this decision is based on trust. Aggregators accept the monographs
offered by the OAPEN Library as a viable source, and make them available
to their patrons.
The importance of aggregators is also visible in the results of chapter
5: their influence on usage is much stronger than that of licenses. Within
the literature on open access, the role of licenses is discussed extensively.
According to the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA),
“true” open access can only be achieved through the use of a specific Creative Commons license: CC-BY (Redhead, 2012). If true open access means
optimal dissemination of scholarly content, books published under an open
license – which allows sharing it contents – should perform better than
books made available under a license that permits nothing more than downloading for personal use. I tested this hypothesis on the OAPEN Library,
where roughly half of the collection is available under a license permitting
reuse, and the other half under a license that only permits personal use. The
results showed that the number of downloads of open licensed books did
not differ significantly from the monographs with a “free to read” license.
However, I also investigated the role of the Directory of Open Access
Books (DOAB), by examining the usage data of the same collection after
the launch of DOAB. The DOAB aggregates open access books, but only
those with an open license. Open licenses such as Creative Commons are
machine-readable: they can be used in automated processes, leading to new
possibilities. In the case of the OAPEN Library, the licensing information is
part of the metadata. The metadata is used by the DOAB, in order to select
books with an open license. When the period after the launch of DOAB
was examined, the difference is far greater. Books listed in the DOAB have
been downloaded almost twice as much on average compared to the other
group of titles. Even when allowing for the role of subject and language, the
influence of DOAB is profound.
While the license is seen by many in the scholarly communication field
as an important enabler for open access, it is doubtful whether the readers
care as much. The results seem to suggest that a “free to share” license
is not an important incentive compared to a “free to read” license. The
number of downloads was not boosted by an open license, the usage was
boosted by incorporation of a new service: DOAB. It is DOAB policy to only
list monographs with an open license, and thus half of the OAPEN Library
collection was imported, leading to the large difference in usage.
The influence of other aggregators could explain the large uptake of the
books listed in DOAB. When more aggregators are aware of the existence
of DOAB, compared to the OAPEN Library, the monographs listed in DOAB

206

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

will receive more attention. Several authors see DOAB as a comprehensive
source of open access monographs (McCollough, 2017; Morisson, 2016).
More exposure will also lead to more data usage. Again, usage is strongly
affected by trust: being listed in DOAB – a widely trusted source – results
in more aggregation and thus more visibility, which stimulates the usage
of open access monographs.
As far as usage by readers is concerned, the results of chapter 5 seem
to downplay the role of licenses. Given the fact that a large percentage of
the books were published under a CC-BY-NC-ND license – which does not
permit commercial use or creation of derivative works – other stakeholders
might consider those licenses as equal to ‘free to read’ licenses. For instance,
research institutes may be more strongly bound to the terms of the licenses,
especially when a large set of books is examined. The use of large corpora
for text mining depends on permissions by rights holders (Van Noorden,
2014). Still, the influence of aggregation in DOAB is undeniable: even the
books published under the most restricted open licence have been used
more, compared to the books available for reading purposes only.
In conclusion, while licenses are important for certain groups of users,
this is not the case for those who want to read the books. For them, usage
is not boosted by licenses, but by the choices of aggregators.
10.4.2 Clustering books and readers
So far, I have looked at book dissemination purely based on numbers;
examining factors affecting the number of downloads, a proxy for the
number of times a book is read. Chapter 6 uses a different angle: creating
clusters of books that are suitable for a group of readers. Instead of lumping
the users of the OAPEN Library together into large groups such as academics, government employees or the general public, an attempt is made to
uncover “communities”: groups of people that share an interest. Defining
communities and finding suitable titles is an important task of libraries.
Online retailers such as Amazon use a different strategy, based on personal
recommendations. Creating a more fine-grained understanding of the users
of any open access platform helps to deliver the best titles. However, it
also leads to questions of privacy: is it desirable to store information about
individuals? These questions are examined in chapter 6.
One of the most prominent success factors of online retailers is the
amount of knowledge they possess about their customers. If the preferences of each client are known, it is possible to offer desirable products. In
such circumstances, the online retailer will strive to maximise the amount

CONCLUSIONS

207

of known facts about all their customers. I noted before that collecting
and storing data about individuals leads to discussions about privacy. For
libraries, the protection of their patron’s privacy is an important part of their
core values. Online dissemination platforms could model themselves after
online retailers; after all, apart from charging money for their services, they
perform more or less the same functions. However, the main purpose of
open access platforms is not to maximise sales, but to maximise the usage
of documents, which is closer to the core values of libraries.
I investigated whether it is possible to create optimized recommendations while storing a minimum amount of information about individuals. A
solution for this problem might be found in the download behaviour of all
users of a dissemination platform. By analysing all data at once, instead of
focusing on individuals, it might be possible to discern patterns: clusters of
related books that are downloaded together. If such clusters can be found,
they could form the basis of a recommendation, akin to recommendations
by online retailers. To create an optimal solution, it is also necessary to
understand who is interested in a specific cluster of books, without targeting
individuals. To resolve this, the research focuses on finding communities:
groups that share a common trait.
The research was based on two data sets, consisting of providers, books
and the number of times a book was downloaded. The first set was captured
during 2012 and the next set is based on data from 2014. Each book in the collection was categorised through its language and subject. The information
about providers is limited to name and country of origin. The linked titles
and providers are clustered using the Wakita-Tsurumi (2007) algorithm,
resulting in dozens of clusters. The ten biggest clusters were analysed,
comparing the books’ language and subject and the providers’ nationalities
to the complete data set.
Within the examined data, several clusters could be identified that
were not the result of random downloads. Some clusters contain large
percentages of non-English books, combined with a large set of providers
consisting of native speakers. An example is a cluster containing Dutch
language books combined with many providers from the Netherlands and
Belgium. Other clusters – where the language is mostly English – contain
books on certain subject, such as film and media studies or Indonesia and
South-East Asia. When the subject is region-based, this is also reflected in
the nationality of the providers.
The clusters are not created manually, but are the result of an algorithm.
Consequently, this procedure can be part of an automated process, akin to
the recommendation services of online retailers but without violating the

208

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

privacy of individuals. However, there is still room for improvement: clusters
found in 2012 are not visible in the 2014 data. This is not uncommon: other
research on clustering techniques also show differences, all of which might
be valid in their own right (Gläser et al., 2017).
In conclusion, to a certain extent it is possible to use clustering algorithms
to create optimized recommendations, while still protecting the privacy of
individual readers. Optimized recommendations by open access platforms
should lead to higher usage of open access monographs. The results of
chapter 6 can be seen as a proof of concept, to be further refined.

10.5

Evaluation of results

Until now, I discussed the hybrid business model and several aspects of
digital dissemination affecting the usage of open access monographs.
From these practical considerations I will now move to the outcomes:
does publishing monographs in open access lead to a greater scholarly
impact and societal influence? To answer this question, I first need to
define scholarly and societal impact, insofar as it applies to monographs.
Open access monographs can have an impact on the work of academics – I
will categorize this as academic or scholarly impact – and they might affect
those who do not have access to large academic libraries – defined here as
social or societal impact.
Monographs require other indicators than journal articles. Bibliometric
measurements like the journal impact factor have been used for decades
(Garfield, 2006). For monographs, similar data is not abundantly available;
instead, metrics based on library holdings might be used. My research is
based on usage data, derived from online platforms. In this case, the proxy
value for academic impact is the amount of usage originating from academic
institutions, compared to usage from other organisations. This metric is
restricted to the number of academics who use the internet infrastructure
of their institution to access the OAPEN Library; it will not take into account
academics who use other internet providers. My research on the academic
impact of open access monographs is not limited to usage data: in chapter
9 I have examined whether open access affects the number of citations.
I have examined the social impact of open access monographs using indicators based on usage data. When the usage originates from governmental,
non-profit or business organisations, I have classified this as types of social
impact. Another indicator of the social impact of monographs can be found
in altmetrics, here defined as online activity about academic publications.

CONCLUSIONS

209

Some types of online activity are closely tied to the work of academics, for
instance Mendeley.com or ResearchGate.com. Others – such as Facebook
or Twitter – are used by a large section of the general public. Mentions of
open access monographs on those platforms stand a larger chance to come
from non-academics.
In short, in this section three types of indicators will be discussed: citation based indicators, platform usage and altmetrics. The definition and
mutual relations of these indicators is discussed in more detail by Glänzel
& Gorraiz (2015), who state that the combination of usage, altmetrics and
citations leads to a more complete view of a document’s impact. According
to the authors, citations are an accepted indicator of academic impact, but
do not capture social impact. Usage measures the intention to read documents and altmetrics indicate mentions of documents, both in academia
and beyond.
10.5.1

Impact measured

Indicators of academic impact are relatively easy to identify through usage
originating from academic institutions. Social impact is more diverse: it
encompasses usage by non-academic readers with a professional interest
such as government employees, but also readers without a professional
interest: members of the general public. To distinguish between these
groups, I use the connection to an organisation – which can be inferred from
the usage data – other than an Internet Service Provider or an academic
institution. I assume that non-academic readers with a professional interest
are connected to an organisation.
The defining characteristic of members of the general public is their lack
of connection to an organisation. This complicates identification based
on usage data: if readers use an Internet Service Provider (ISP), does that
mean they are not connected to an organisation, does it mean that “their”
organisation is unable to provide direct internet access, or are they just not
using their organisation’s equipment? Differences in internet infrastructure
are also at the root of the digital divide between developing and developed
countries, leading to the question whether open access leads to more usage
when the available internet infrastructure is not optimal.
Categorizing users in groups is useful to distinguish between the usage
by academics and usage by others. Simply put: usage of monographs by
non-academics is a form of social impact. Comparing the percentage of nonacademic users of a set of open access monographs to a set of monographs
in closed access helps to determine whether open access leads to a higher

210

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

level of social impact. Thus, we are able to test the assumption that open
access monographs’ availability beyond academic institutions leads to more
usage by non-academics. However, other influences may affect usage. Differences in available infrastructure – the digital divide – is an example.
Another possible factor is the dissemination platform: is it able to reach
non-academics? Furthermore, aspects of the books such as language and
subject play an important role. Any conclusion about the social impact of
open access monographs based on usage data must account for these factors.
Besides usage data, other indicators of social and academic impact are
also available. In the realm of journal articles, the number of citations is
the most-used metric to assess academic impact. For monographs, citations
are more problematic, which has been discussed in chapter 9. Investigating
citation data for books is hampered by a lower availability of indexation
services. Another challenging issue is the slower pace of citations, leading
to a “citation window” of at least six to eight years. The third factor might
be the difference in citation culture between scholarly disciplines. Lastly,
in some fields of HSS, writing in English is not always the norm; this is problematic when citation indexes might be biased toward Anglo-Saxon regions
(Nederhof, 2006). As is the case with usage data, any conclusion about the
academic impact must take into account the special circumstances around
open access monographs.
An indication of social impact might be found using altmetrics. Altmetrics share much characteristics with usage data. Instead of counting
activities from infrastructure that is directly connected to documents, the
usage of a broad range of social media and other online outlets is measured.
As is the case with online book platforms, some outlets are more strongly
directed towards academic users, while others are more open to everybody.
For instance, online reference managers such as Mendeley or specialised
websites such as ResearchGate are far more used by academics, while
platforms such as Twitter or Facebook have a more diverse user base. On
top of this, the different altmetrics outlets are also aligned differently to
document types. Hammarfelt (2014) concludes that Mendeley is the best
altmetrics outlet for humanities articles, while books are mostly mentioned
on Twitter. In conclusion, Twitter is most likely to be used by the general
public and mentions books most often. For that reason, the number of
tweets is used as an indicator of social impact in chapter 9.
The next section discusses several examinations of the impact of open
access on academics and non-academics.

CONCLUSIONS

211

10.5.2 Indications of impact
The question examined in chapter 7 is how to provide quantitative evidence
of both academic and social impact of HSS research. The use of bibliometric
data for monographs is problematic and the humanities and social sciences
tend to place more emphasis on the societal impact of the results. Delivering evidence of impact depends for a large part on either self-reporting or
in-depth discussion with stakeholders. Both methods are labour-intensive
and susceptible to bias. Here, taking advantage of usage data might help to
display another aspect: interaction with published results. Like altmetrics,
the usage data is the direct result of online interaction, and the large number
of data points enables the creation of sophisticated reports.
The usage data contains information about the organisation through
which the reader accesses the web. By determining the type of organisation
and the country of origin it is possible to assess the impact of the books,
both in academia and beyond. The methods – tested on the OAPEN Library
in 2011 – helps to uncover stakeholders, who may not always be known
beforehand. Over 27% of the data is directly linked to academic users.
In contrast, the usage linked directly to other “professional” users is less
than 5%. The remaining 67% cannot be directly ascribed to the general
public. The type of provider is a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP),
making it impossible to determine what organisation – if any – the reader
is associated with.
In order to better categorize this large group of readers, I combined the
available information about the country of origin with the state of intranet
infrastructure. By using a fairly strict threshold, countries were grouped in
those with a highly developed internet infrastructure, and those without.
I assume that readers from a country with a highly developed internet
infrastructure who download monographs out of a professional interest
are more likely to use their organisation’s internet infrastructure instead
of an ISP. Thus, readers based in countries with a highly developed internet
infrastructure that use an ISP to access the monographs, are more likely to
be part of the general public. In this way, the large group of uncategorized
users – 67% – can be classified. The smaller half of this group is still not
categorizable, but the other half might be part of the general public in the
wealthier countries of the world.
Apart from using provider types as proxies for users, the influence of
scholarly discipline was analysed by looking at the differences in usage for
humanities and social sciences books. Also, the differences in geographical
impact of books in English versus books in Dutch are quite visible.

212

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

The question I examine is not whether more people are interacting with
the monographs, the question is what kind of people are using the open
access books. Usage should always be evaluated within the context of the
platform. For instance, measuring usage of an academic library will not
lead to finding many non-academic readers. The OAPEN Library is freely
accessible and has taken several measures to make its content widely used,
which might help to attract many different users.
When the results of chapter 4 are considered, we see that three-quarters
of usage stems from direct access: incorporation into other systems than the
OAPEN Library interface. The usage percentage from academic providers is
less than 20%, while the usage through ISPs operating in countries with a
highly developed internet infrastructure is 50%. Both the results of chapter
4 and of chapter 7 point to a relative low usage directly linked to academic
institutions. The results of chapter 4 seem to suggest that other platforms
than the OAPEN Library incorporate descriptions of the books. However, a
large percentage of those platforms are not directly linked to an academic
institution.
Thus, given these results it is feasible that the OAPEN Library’s contents
are available to readers beyond academic institutions in the “global north”.
The percentages directly linked to readers with a professional interest –
those linked to government, non-profit or business organisations – are
invariably low. And the largest single category consists of internet providers that have – at the very least – a possible link to readers that have
downloaded the books for other than professional reasons. Returning to
assessment within the context of a platform, its potential reach is wider
than academic institutions alone. Consequently, the books available at an
open access dissemination platform stand a good chance of reaching a wider
audience. The percentage of monographs that are downloaded frequently
and by other categories than academic institutions alone, are an indication
of social impact.
Social impact is not restricted to the “global north”; does open access help
to bridge the digital divide between those living in the richest countries
and those in other parts of the world? Chapter 8 surveys whether open
access enhances the use in the developing countries. In other words: does
open access help to overcome the inequality in access to the internet, both
in a technical sense and in lack of knowledge to optimally use the available resources? To test this, the usage data of the books in the experiment
performed by Snijder (2010) were combined with geographical user data.
During the experiment – run in 2009 – several sets of monographs were
made freely available. Another set of books was used as a control group.

CONCLUSIONS

213

The data was gathered from the Google Books platform; access to the books
was strictly controlled for the experiment. This platform was ideally suited
for this type of experiments: while all books on the Google Books platform
were fully indexed by the Google search engine, it allowed publishers to
decide what percentage of the book’s contents were freely available. Thus,
some books could be fully read online – 100% of the content available – and
the control books showed no more than 10% of the text. To remove bias,
the sets were carefully set up, based on subject; type of work; expected
sales and publication date. The analysis in chapter 8 is based on 180 English
language monographs.
Even when using a platform that is part of a globally used search engine,
the digital divide between developed and developing countries is clearly
visible: only 30% of the usage comes from developing countries. Further
analysis of the differences between the usage of the open access books
versus the closed access books revealed a more positive outcome. When
reviewing the usage from developing countries and developed countries, the
relative usage of open access monographs by developing counties was higher
compared to the usage of the books that were not completely available. This
is an indication of social impact: more usage of open access monographs
by those in a disadvantaged position.
Before, I examined the possible influence of the collection’s geographical
focus and usage from the same region. While it might be a factor contributing to the lower usage from developing countries, the setup of the
experimental and the control set of books helped to evenly spread the
subjects. Additionally, the differences in internet infrastructure will have
played a role in access and – in this case – the positive influence of open
access is visible.
So far, I discussed usage as a means to measure academic and social impact of open access monographs. When the users are categorized by organisation type, academic users are the largest group. However, the combined
download figures from academic organisations amount to roughly 20% of
all downloads. In other words: it is possible to show the academic impact
of open access monographs, but based on this data it is hard to conclude
that open access enhances usage among academics. When I look at social
impact, the results point toward increased usage by those who normally
face additional challenges to access scholarly books: non-academics in the
“global north” and those living and working in developing countries.
In order to answer the question whether open access has a positive
influence in academia, I turned to another measurement: the number of
citations. Many open access advocates have discussed the positive influence

214

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

on citations – seen by many as a major indicator of academic impact. Can
a ‘citation advantage’ for open access monographs be found? This has been
investigated numerous times for journal articles, but scarcely for books.
The research of chapter 9 dealt with these aspects in several ways. Instead
of relying on a citation index, I used the Google Scholar platform. Secondly,
to account for the “citation window”, the examined books were published
at least five years before the date of obtaining the data. The differences
in disciplines – and languages – have been dealt with in several ways. To
maintain a balanced division of subjects and languages, I used the same
sets of books as in Snijder (2010). Furthermore, I studied the influence of
books in humanities versus other disciplines, plus additional testing on
several groups of books on more specialised subjects.
To examine social impact, I used altmetrics. As mentioned before, some
altmetrics sources are geared towards academic users, while others target a
more diverse audience. Reference managers such as Mendeley are strongly
related to academic use, while platforms like Facebook or Twitter are used
by all types of internet users. In this research, I selected the altmetrics
platform that performs best on monographs and is mostly connected to
the general public: Twitter.
Given these preparations and choices, is it possible to establish whether
open access has a positive effect on the number of citations? Also, does open
access lead to more uptake by the general public? Looking at citations, the
results are more or less in line with the literature on journal articles: a small
but statistically significant positive effect of open access on the number
of citations, even when the analysis takes into account the influence of
language and subject. For tweets, the situation is slightly different. In the
same way as citations, the average number of tweets about open access
monographs is larger than the number of tweets about closed access books.
However, the difference is not statistically significant. Lastly, little overlap
exists between Twitter usage and citation behaviour. Thus, open access does
not affect Twitter mentions in the same way as citations.
If citations are an indication of scholarly impact, the results point to
positive influence of open access. However, the influence is not very large.
A possible explanation might be found in the fact that a large proportion
of researchers who are interested in the books in the data set, are in the
position to access its contents anyway. This is supported by the outcomes
of in chapter 8: in 2009, over 70% of usage of the English language books –
which have a more global audience compared to the Dutch language books
– was connected to the richest countries. Presumably, readers working in

CONCLUSIONS

those countries have a far better chance to view the books’ contents, either
through a library or by buying a copy.
Does this mean that the higher uptake of open access books – see Emery
et al. (2017); Ferwerda et al. (2013); Snijder (2010) – can be mainly attributed
to non-academics? Given the results of chapter 6, where roughly one-third
of the usage has a larger chance to be associated with the general public,
this might seem plausible. However, this conclusion is supported by indirect
evidence. First of all, the data set of chapter 8 is based on 400 books. Whether
this set is large enough to warrant such broad conclusions is questionable.
Secondly, if I assume that the Twitter usage in chapter 9 indicates interest by the general public, the lack of statistically significant evidence is
problematic. And lastly, I have discussed the differences in platforms. The
users of the Google Book platform might differ significantly from the users
of the OAPEN Library, and any conclusion spanning multiple platforms
should be backed by solid evidence.
Direct evidence of the societal impact of open access monographs beyond
the downloads of businesses, governmental organisations and non-profit
organisation is not easy to obtain. Likewise, knowing what usage is related
to the general public – which is by definition not affiliated to a specific
type of organisation – is also problematic. Compared to journal articles,
the available research data is still scarce. Therefore, more data is needed
to provide more definitive answers, especially usage data and data about
the collections of other open access book platforms. This will enable us
to compare the effects of the identified factors on platforms with other
collections and affordances: what are the effects on usage, citations or
altmetrics? Hopefully, my research marks the start of more investigations.

10.6

Concluding remarks: factors affecting usage and the
impact of open access

The introduction states that the level of open access monographs usage is
primarily determined by book-related factors such as language and scholarly field or the configuration of dissemination platforms. The results show
that these factors indeed affect the usage. Another factor is the level of trust
in the content on offer. Contrary to expectations from several open access
advocates, open licenses do not affect the level of usage. Furthermore, open
access does not lead to more sales of monographs, yet it enhances usage in
developing countries and the number of citations.

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Most experiments in this dissertation have involved the collection of the
OAPEN Library; a diverse set of books spanning multiple disciplines and
languages. Therefore, it was relatively easy to measure how subject as proxy
for scholarly field and language play an important role. For instance, while
the topic of migration is not only discussed in academic circles but also in
most newspapers, the audience for Sumerian spells1 might be smaller. Usage
is also connected to the geographical location of the readers: academic
books discussing a certain part of the world tend to be read more by those
who come from the same region. The usage of monographs written in other
languages than English is also affected by geographic factors: books in
German are more downloaded in German-speaking countries; the usage
of Dutch language books is highest in The Netherlands.
The role of subject and language was to be expected. Furthermore, it is
obvious that online dissemination is affected by the infrastructure that
supports it. This has been clearly visible in the digital divide between
rich and less well-off countries. Another aspect of online dissemination
infrastructure is its interconnectivity: how well does one source integrate
into another platform? The fact that the majority of the OAPEN Library
downloads does not involve the front end can be seen as an illustration of
the immersion into other systems.
Whether the technical abilities of dissemination platforms such as the
OAPEN Library or the Directory of Open Access Books are used depends
on a far less obvious factor: trust. Making a book available online does not
automatically lead to optimal usage. Most people rely on filtering mechanisms to separate the wheat from the chaff. These mechanisms may include
library catalogues, mentions on social media, specialised websites or blogs
and many more possibilities. Additionally, the “filters” may rely on other
sources: for instance, libraries might employ content aggregators.
In short, whether an open access monograph – or a platform that disseminates open access monographs – is accepted, depends on a conscious
decision, not solely on an automated process. This is illustrated by the added
usage from inclusion into the Directory of Open Access Books, but also
by the inclusion of the contents of the OAPEN Library into other systems.
Ultimately, the decision to use an open access book platform is based on
trust. Trust and the notion of quality are closely connected: when the books
on offer are of sufficient quality, the prospective readers – or aggregators
– will take action to obtain one or more books. As it is unlikely that each

CONCLUSIONS

book on the open access book platform will be vetted before downloading,
the prospective readers – or the aggregators acting on their behalf – must
assume that the offering is of sufficient quality. In other words, the readers
must put their trust in the choices made by the platform.
Subject, language, infrastructure and trust are all influences that shape
the usage of open access monographs. Other factors are not as important:
licenses and the effects on sales. Licenses are seen as an important part of
open access: the ability for readers to reuse the content has been described
explicitly in the BOAI (Chan et al., 2002). Given the emphasis on reuse,
it was reasonable to expect more usage of monographs made available
under a licence that actually permits it. However, whether an open access
monograph licence only permits reading and downloading for personal use
or enables content-sharing did not matter. Thus, the influence of licenses
on usage is negligible.
The conclusion that open access does not affect the sales of monographs
is not very surprising. I have been involved – directly and indirectly – in
several experiments to measure the effect of open access on monograph
sales (Collins & Milloy, 2016; Ferwerda et al., 2013; Snijder, 2010; SNSF, 2015).
In contrast to chapter 3, these experiments are based on a careful selection
of monographs: an experimental set of titles that are published in open
access, and a control group consisting of comparable books. None of these
experiments resulted in a significant increase or decrease of the number
of copies sold for the set of open access monographs.
Open access to monographs leads however to more usage in developing
countries, a positive result. One of the goals of open access is enhancing the
usage by those who would otherwise not be able to read scholarly output.
Here, this goal has been achieved, albeit on a small scale. Another oftenused benchmark in the realm of journal articles is the “citation advantage”
of open access publications. For monographs, I was able to demonstrate a
slight citation advantage.
To recapitulate, while open access monographs dissemination is only
possible by removing paywalls, the level of usage is primarily determined
by language, subject, infrastructure and trust. Given these influences, open
access enhances usage in developing countries and the number of citations.

10.7

Practical implications and further research

What are the practical implications of these results? In my opinion, an
open access monographs platform should focus on trust. After all, trust is

218

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

the most important aspect: any platform can only be successful if people
want to use it. Transparency about the selection criteria of the collection
helps prospective readers and aggregators to determine whether the books
on offer are of interest to them. In the case of OAPEN, the criteria (quality
controlled monographs) are listed on the homepage, and the quality control
process of the publishers is described.2 The Directory of Open Access Books
has adopted a similar policy.3
When a reader or an aggregator wants to use the content, the platform
should make it easy to connect. We have seen before that the OAPEN
Library is used via several channels: not just as an online public access
catalogue, but also as a web based database that can be integrated into a
larger collection. To ensure technical integration, the platform should offer
its metadata based on standards that are used by the reader or aggregator.
For instance, OAPEN supports aggregators with metadata feeds based on
ONIX – a standard used in the publishing industry – and MARC21 – a
library standard. Readers who are interested in a single title can download
metadata in RIS format – to be used in citation managers – or use a widget
to share the description via social media and mail. Connecting with readers or aggregators ought to go beyond technical measures. In the case of
the OAPEN Library and DOAB, this is translated into agreements with
commercial and non-commercial aggregators and by using social media
to connect to individuals.
Language has proven to be an important influence on usage. Furthermore, the bulk of the usage of the OAPEN Library so far stems from the
“global north”. To extend the usage to the rest of the world, it might be useful
to add monographs in Spanish and Portuguese to the collection – languages
that are spoken in Latin-America. Also, a larger collection in French might
be more attractive to the French-speaking countries in Africa.
The results so far are a good start towards understanding the effects
of open access on monographs and the factors affecting usage of open
access monographs. However, further research could help to deepen our
understanding. The first research question would be the identification of
usage by the general public. In my research, recognizing members of the
public was based on eliminating possible organisational ties. Research on
this topic should take into account privacy considerations; this has also
been discussed in chapter 6.

CONCLUSIONS

219

In this dissertation, most of the research has been carried out on the
OAPEN Library platform. As more open access book platforms are emerging,
it will be interesting to repeat some of the experiments on those platforms.
Wat are the effects of differences in technical abilities and book collections?
Comparing usage results of multiple platforms has its own challenges; the
COUNTER Code of Practice (COUNTER Online Metrics, 2014) might be
useful in this case.
The effects of open access on the usage originating from developing
countries has been discussed in detail. However, the collection of titles in
this investigation have been provided by publishers from the “global north”.
If the collection of titles is enhanced with a sizable portion of titles from
“global south” publishers, how would that affect the usage data? Does this
lead to a higher percentage of usage from developing countries? Will the
enhanced exposure be beneficial for authors?
I have deployed a clustering algorithm to find related books, based on usage by readers. The next phase would be to test several algorithms, in order
to see if other procedures lead to comparable results. This will strengthen
the claims of chapter 6. A related question is whether new algorithms lead
to more fine-grained clusters.
Related to clustering algorithms, using text mining techniques to extract
subjects from books might lead to new possibilities, for instance automatically clustering books based on distinctive words or word sequences and
comparing these ‘subject clusters’ with the clusters of providers that were
created for chapter 6.
Another possibility, based on the contents of the books, is to automatically define distinctive text segments, and searching whether they are used
in newspapers, reports and other non-academic documents. This might help
to determine the social impact of the monographs. The same technique
could also be used as a service to readers, by searching for related academic
open access documents in large databases such as BASE - Bielefeld Academic
Search Engine. 4
When the focus is widened beyond questions of usage, we might look
a the role of paper books. Open access is inherently digital – based on
online dissemination. Still, the role of paper books is not obsolete: the lack
of influence of open access on sales of ‘traditional’ monographs points in
that direction. Each publication form has its own merits, but it would be
interesting to investigate whether the ideal of world wide free dissemination
of knowledge can be combined with the affordances of paper publications.

The success of this approach will depend on the stakeholders in scholarly
publication.
Changes in online dissemination and the variations in stakeholder roles
were already briefly discussed in section 10.4. The effects of this transition
merit further research: if publishers continue to build online libraries, and
academic libraries keep enlarging their publishing role, how will this affect
scholarly communication?
In conclusion, the research on the dissemination of knowledge through
open access monographs is far from finished. We have barely started.

Samenvatting
De voorziening van Open Access boeken – Onderzoek naar gebruik en
disseminatie
Hoofdstuk 2
Dit proefschrift onderzoekt de verspreiding en het gebruik van Open Access
monografieën, iets waar ik sinds 2008 aan gewerkt heb. Open Access monografieën zijn gedefinieerd als een wetenschappelijke tekst van boeklengte
over een specifiek onderwerp, online verspreid op zo’n manier dat de inhoud
ervan zonder enige belemmering kan worden gelezen en gedownload. Het
op deze manier verspreiden van wetenschappelijke boeken is onderdeel
van de Open Access-beweging, die wetenschappelijke inhoud voor iedereen
toegankelijk wil maken.
Platformen voor Open Access monografieën zijn vrij nieuw en ze zijn
slechts één aspect van de veranderingen in de manier waarop wetenschappelijke resultaten openbaar worden gemaakt. Het vrij toegankelijk maken
van academische boeken verhoogt altijd het aantal pagina’s dat online wordt
gelezen of het aantal gedownloade exemplaren; een conclusie die nogal voor
de hand ligt. De volgende fase is om te onderzoeken hoe dit gebruik kan
worden geoptimaliseerd en of het toegenomen gebruik positieve effecten
heeft in de academische wereld en daarbuiten.
Het definiëren van “gebruik” is een uitdaging; in deze dissertatie wordt de
term “gebruik” voor zover het betrekking heeft op Open Access monografieën
gedefinieerd als het benaderen van de inhoud van de boeken. Dit is niet
precies hetzelfde als het lezen van een monografie. Het meeste onderzoek
van dit proefschrift wordt gedaan met behulp van het OAPEN-platform.
Hoewel het gebruik van Open Access monografieën afhankelijk is van
het verwijderen van de paywalls, wordt het gebruiksniveau voornamelijk
bepaald door andere factoren. Eigenschappen van de boeken zoals de taal
en het wetenschapsgebied bepalen de mogelijke lezers en de manier waarop
verspreidingsplatformen worden geconfigureerd beïnvloedt of die lezers
ook daadwerkelijk kunnen worden bereikt. In dit proefschrift onderzoek
ik drie belangrijke aspecten: economische duurzaamheid, optimalisatie
van de infrastructuur en evaluatie van de resultaten.

238

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

Economische duurzaamheid van het publiceren van Open Access monografieën leidt tot de vraag of Open Access een positieve invloed heeft op de
verkoop van monografieën. Dit wordt besproken in hoofdstuk 3.
Een fundamentele vraag voor de optimalisatie van de infrastructuur is
hoe de collectie aan potentiële lezers kan worden gepresenteerd. Moet het
platform alleen als een “silo” toegankelijk zijn of moet het proberen zijn
aanbod in andere systemen te integreren? Dit wordt besproken in hoofdstuk
4. De OAPEN Library bevat boeken met een licentie die hergebruik mogelijk
maakt en boeken met een restrictievere licentie. Heeft dit verschil in licentie
invloed op het gebruik? Bovendien wordt de invloed van aggregatie via een
ander platform – de Directory of Open Access Books – gemeten. Dit wordt
besproken in hoofdstuk 5 Hoe kunnen we de succesvolle strategie van
online retailers toepassen – die de voorkeuren van hun klanten opslaan –
zonder inbreuk te maken op privacy? Een mogelijke oplossing kan worden
gevonden in sociale analysetechnieken om gebruikersgemeenschappen te
ontdekken. Dit wordt besproken in hoofdstuk 6.
De volgende hoofdstukken gaan in op de resultaten van verspreiding
van Open Access monografieën; te beginnen met de vraag hoe de effecten
van Open Access-monografieën kunnen worden geëvalueerd. Ik heb de
mogelijkheid onderzocht om de effecten van onderzoek op het gebied
van Geesteswetenschappen en Sociale Wetenschappen te kwantificeren
op een manier die relatief eenvoudig is toe te passen. Dit wordt besproken in hoofdstuk 7. Verkleint Open Access de digitale kloof tussen “the
global north” en “the global south”? Leidt Open Access tot meer gebruik in
ontwikkelingslanden? Dit wordt besproken in hoofdstuk 8. Ten slotte heb
ik onderzocht of er een “Open Access voordeel” is voor monografieën. Het
is uitgebreid gedocumenteerd voor tijdschriftartikelen, maar het effect van
Open Access op citaten is grotendeels onbekend. Hetzelfde geldt voor sociale
media. Hoofdstuk 9 gaat in op de vraag of Open Access-monografieën meer
worden geciteerd en meer aandacht krijgen op sociale media.
Hoofdstuk 3
Het hybride model van Amsterdam University Press (AUP) combineert
de verkoop van monografieën met het publiceren in Open Access. Dit
hoofdstuk beschrijft het onderzoek naar de effecten van publiceren in Open
Access op de verkoop van monografieën, in combinatie met commercieel
potentieel, “front list”, “back list” en taal. De dataset bevat verkoopcijfers
van 513 boeken, verspreid over 36 maanden: 2010 tot 2012. Meer dan 70%
van deze boeken zijn gepubliceerd in Open Access en worden verspreid via
de OAPEN Library.

SA MEN VATTING

Elke invloed is relevant, waardoor het moeilijker wordt om de effecten
van Open Access te onderscheiden. Het grote verschil tussen verkoopcijfers
van de “front list” vergeleken met de “back list” leidt tot een afzonderlijke
analyse. De resultaten van de verkoop aan de “front list” kunnen worden
verklaard door een combinatie van commercieel potentieel en taal; publiceren in Open Access heeft in deze situatie geen effect.
In de “back list” heeft publiceren in Open Access een relevante invloed
op de verkoop in bepaalde gevallen: de subsets van boeken met een oplage
tussen 1 en 2000. Er kon geen significant effect worden gemeten op boeken
met een oplage van nul of op boeken met een oplage tussen 2001 en 3000. Het
hybride model leidt niet tot meer verkoop van Open Access-monografieën
en het verlies aan omzet is verwaarloosbaar. De gegevens suggereren dat
een hybride model de winstgevendheid van monografieën niet verbetert.
Hoofdstuk 4
Welk effect hebben verschillende verspreidingskanalen in een Open Access
omgeving? Deze vraag wordt beantwoord op basis van de downloadgegevens van de OAPEN Library. De downloadgegevens zijn afkomstig van
drie kanalen: alleen website, website en directe toegang gecombineerd,
en alleen directe toegang. De downloadgegevens van 979 boeken in de
OAPEN Library werden geanalyseerd. De monografieën werden 152.662 keer
gedownload in de eerste zes maanden van 2012. De kwantitatieve analyse
laat zien dat directe toegang het meest belangrijk is. Bijna driekwart van
alle downloads komt van gebruikers die de website www.oapen.org niet
gebruiken, maar de boeken op een andere manier vinden. De kwalitatieve
analyse kon geen bewijs vinden dat het kanaalgebruik werd beïnvloed door
gebruikersgroepen noch door de internetinfrastructuur van de gebruikers.
Hetzelfde geldt voor de kenmerken van de boeken zelf: er werd geen effect
op het kanaalgebruik gevonden voor zowel de taal als de onderwerpen van
de monografieën.
Directe downloads vinden plaats als de lezers andere systemen gebruiken
dan de OAPEN Library website, ondanks het feit dat deze functies biedt die
niet via andere kanalen beschikbaar zijn. Dit houdt in dat het beschikbaar
maken van de metadata in de systemen van de gebruiker – de infrastructuur
die dagelijks wordt gebruikt – de beste resultaten oplevert.
Hoofdstuk 5
Open Access en open licenties – zoals Creative Commons (CC) – zijn
nauw met elkaar verweven. Zowel Creative Commons als Open Access
proberen de balans te herstellen tussen de degenen die het auteursrechten

240

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

hebben en potentiële gebruikers. Afgezien van de juridische aspecten rond
CC-licenties, kunnen we kijken naar de rol van tussenpersonen. Leidt het
gebruik van een CC-licentie voor documenten direct tot meer (her)gebruik,
of wordt dit versterkt door tussenpersonen? Voor de OAPEN Library fungeert de Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) als tussenpersoon: DOAB
aggregeert uitsluitend boeken met een open licentie, en geen boeken met
een licentie die hergebruik niet toestaat.
Dit hoofdstuk beschrijft de analyse van een gegevens set die gedurende
een periode van 33 maanden is verzameld. In die periode werden 1734 verschillende boeken beschikbaar gesteld via de OAPEN Library: 855 boeken
onder een Creative Commons-licentie en 879 boeken onder een restrictiever
regime. De invloed van open licenties; aggregatie in DOAB; onderwerp en
taal zijn onderzocht, met het volgende resultaat: zodra rekening is gehouden
met de effecten van onderwerp en taal, is er geen bewijs dat het beschikbaar
maken van boeken onder open licenties leidt tot meer downloads dan het
beschikbaar maken van boeken onder licenties die alleen gebruik voor
persoonlijk gebruik toestaan.
Extra aggregatie in DOAB heeft wel een groot positief effect op het aantal
keren dat een boek wordt gedownload. De toepassing van open licenties op
boeken leidt op zichzelf niet tot meer downloads. Open licenties maken het
mogelijk dat tussenpersonen nieuwe diensten kunnen aanbieden.
Hoofdstuk 6
Open Access-bibliotheken opereren tussen twee verschillende organisatiemodellen: online retailers versus “traditionele” bibliotheken. Online
retailers zoals Amazon.com zijn succesvol door het aanbevelen van zaken
die voldoen aan de specifieke behoeften van hun klanten. De klant moet
dan wel bereid zijn om persoonlijke informatie te delen, wat tot mogelijke privacy schendingen. Bescherming van privacy daarentegen is een
kernwaarde voor bibliotheken. De vraag is hoe Open Access-bibliotheken
vergelijkbare diensten kunnen aanbieden, terwijl de privacy van de lezers
wordt beschermd. Een mogelijke oplossing kan gevonden worden in het
analyseren van de voorkeuren van groepen van mensen met dezelfde interesses: gebruikersgroepen.
Dit hoofdstuk onderzoekt de mogelijkheid om de voorkeuren van
gebruikersgroepen in een Open Access-bibliotheek te achterhalen met
behulp van analysemethoden voor sociale netwerken. Hiervoor worden
twee gegevenssets onderzocht. De set van 2012 bestaat uit 967 verschillende titels die werden gedownload door 5.180 aanbieders. Het totale aantal
downloads is 34.345. De set van 2014 bevat 2.334 verschillende titels die

SA MEN VATTING

241

60.238 keer zijn gedownload, via 6.316 aanbieders. De gekoppelde titels en
aanbieders zijn geclusterd met behulp van het Wakita-Tsurumi algoritme.
De gevonden patronen helpen bij het definiëren van interesses van grotere groepen lezers; een voorwaarde voor het creëren van nieuwe diensten.
De resultaten kunnen worden gezien als een “proof of concept”; een mogelijk
startpunt voor Open Access-bibliotheken die de privacy van individuele
lezers willen beschermen.
Hoofdstuk 7
In de geestes- en sociale wetenschappen is de monografie een belangrijk
communicatiemiddel. De kwaliteit van het onderzoek worden beoordeeld
op basis van bibliometrie en kwalitatieve methoden. Bibliometrische
analyses op basis van artikelen werken niet goed op het in de geestes- en
sociale wetenschappen, waar monografieën de norm zijn. De kwalitatieve
methoden die rekening houden met verschillende belanghebbenden zijn
arbeidsintensief en de resultaten zijn afhankelijk van zelfbeoordeling,
wat een vertekend beeld kan geven. In het geval van geesteswetenschappen wordt het beeld nog minder duidelijk door onzekerheden over wie de
belanghebbenden zijn.
Dit hoofdstuk beschrijft een methode die een aanvulling kan zijn op het
huidige onderzoek naar wetenschappelijke impact en maatschappelijke
relevantie. Deze methode meet het gebruik van online monografieën en
identificeert de betrokken internetprovider. De providers zijn gecategoriseerd als academisch; regering; bedrijf; non-profit organisaties en het
algemene publiek. Het gebruik is verder gecategoriseerd in nationaal en
internationaal. Het combineren van deze gegevens maakt het mogelijk
om de wetenschappelijke impact en de maatschappelijke relevantie van
de monografieën te beoordelen. De methode is kwantitatief, waardoor
de resultaten gemakkelijker te valideren zijn. Het is niet nodig om de belanghebbenden van tevoren te kennen: de lezers worden via de methode
geïdentificeerd. De gebruikte dataset bestaat uit meer dan 25.000 downloads
van meer dan 1500 providers, gespreid over 859 monografieën. Meer dan
twee derde van het gebruik kan worden gecategoriseerd en bijna 45% van
alle gebruik komt van niet-academici. Dit is een mogelijke indicatie dat de
monografieën relevant zijn voor de samenleving.
De invloeden van onderwerp en taal werden geanalyseerd. De meeste
onderwerpen die vaker dan gemiddeld zijn gedownload, komen uit de
sociale wetenschappen; de geesteswetenschappen waren minder “populair”.
Boeken in het Engels – de “lingua franca” van de wetenschap – werden het
meest gedownload. Talen zoals het Nederlands werden veel minder gelezen

242

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

buiten de landsgrenzen. De voorgestelde methode kan worden gebruikt als
aanvulling op de bestaande instrumenten om de wetenschappelijke impact
en de maatschappelijke relevantie te meten.
Hoofdstuk 8
Open Access wordt gezien als een manier om barrières voor onderzoek in
ontwikkelingslanden weg te nemen. Om dit te testen, is een experiment
uitgevoerd om te meten of het publiceren van wetenschappelijke boeken in
Open Access een positief effect heeft op het gebruik in ontwikkelingslanden.
Gedurende een periode van negen maanden werden de gebruiksgegevens
van 180 boeken geregistreerd. Daarvan werd een reeks van 43 titels gebruikt
als controlegroep met beperkte toegang. De rest is volledig toegankelijk
gemaakt.
De gegevens tonen de digitale kloof tussen ontwikkelingslanden en
ontwikkelde landen: 70% van de ontdekkingsgegevens en 73% van de
online gebruiksgegevens komen uit ontwikkelde landen. Met behulp van
statistische analyse bevestigt het experiment dat publiceren in Open Access
het ontdekken en het online gebruik in ontwikkelingslanden verbetert. Dit
versterkt de claims van de voorstanders van Open Access: onderzoekers
uit ontwikkelingslanden profiteren van gratis wetenschappelijke boeken.
Hoofdstuk 9
Er is al veel onderzoek gedaan naar de vraag of publiceren in Open Access
een “citatievoordeel” oplevert voor tijdschriftartikelen; terwijl er nog weinig
bekend is over monografieën. De impact van wetenschappelijke publicaties wordt traditioneel beoordeeld op basis van citaten en recentelijk zijn
altmetrics daaraan toegevoegd. Tot voor kort werden boeken grotendeels
genegeerd door degenen die de impact probeerden te meten: zowel op het
gebied van citaties als van altmetrics. Dit hoofdstuk probeert deze lacune te
vullen door de rol van Open Access op de impact van boeken te analyseren
op basis van experimentele gegevens.
In 2009 werd een experiment uitgevoerd met 400 monografieën, waarbij
de effecten van Open Access op werden gemeten. Het experiment was
niet in staat om te meten of Open Acces de wetenschappelijke impact van
boeken – gemeten via citaten – vergroot. Het opnieuw uitvoeren van het
experiment helpt om deze vraag alsnog te beantwoorden. In dit hoofdstuk
wordt voortgebouwd op aanvullende citatiegegevens en ontwikkelingen
op het gebied van altmetrics, en probeert de volgende onderzoeksvraag
te beantwoorden: heeft Open Access een positieve invloed op het aantal
citaten en tweets dat een monografie ontvangt, rekening houdend met

SA MEN VATTING

243

de invloed van wetenschappelijke discipline en taal? Daarnaast wordt de
correlatie tussen monografiecitaties en tweets onderzocht.
De dataset bestaat uit 400 boeken, uitgegeven door Amsterdam University Press (AUP) in de periode 1995-2008. De boeken werden geplaatst in
twee groepen: Geesteswetenschappen en Andere wetenschapsgebieden.
Verder zijn de boeken onderverdeeld in Engelstalige titels en titels in andere
talen. De bron van citaten voor deze studie is de Google Scholar-website, de
Twitter-vermeldingen zijn afkomstig van de Topsy.com-website.
De Open Access boeken waren gemiddeld meer geciteerd in vergelijking
met de controlegroep; een resultaat dat de hypothese bevestigt dat Open Access effect heeft op citaties. Maar na statistische analyses zijn de resultaten
genuanceerder: na correctie op verschillen in taal en onderwerp, bleef er
nog maar een klein positief effect van OA-publicatie op citatiescores over.
De Open Access-boeken hadden een hogere “score” in sociale media, waarbij
de effecten van onderwerp en taal opnieuw een belangrijke rol speelden. De
hogere aantallen zijn echter niet statistisch significant. De resultaten wezen
uit dat er nauwelijks overlap is tussen Twitter-gebruik en citatiegedrag.
Hoofdstuk 10
In dit proefschrift wordt het gebruik van Open Access monograf ieën
gezien als een indicatie van succes. Boeken worden beschouwd als stabiele
objecten, die niet inherent worden veranderd door Open Access disseminatie. Verschillende aspecten van het boek hebben echter invloed op de
online verspreiding. Twee aspecten zijn in de voorgaande hoofdstukken
onderzocht: taal en onderwerp. Een derde aspect is meer impliciet: kwaliteit
gecombineerd met vertrouwen.
De invloed van taal op de verspreiding gaat ver. Een auteur die een
wereldwijd publiek wil bereiken, moet dit in het Engels publiceren.
Elke andere taal dan het Engels zal voornamelijk een “lokaal” publiek
aantrekken. Het onderwerp van een boek wordt gebruikt als een proxy
voor wetenschappelijke discipline. De invloed van de wetenschappelijke
discipline is te vinden op twee gebieden: disseminatie en beoordeling. Kort
gezegd, het onderwerp definieert het publiek: de meesten van degenen die
geïnteresseerd zijn in film- en mediastudies, proberen geen expertise op
het gebied van archeologie te verwerven. Bibliometrische methoden zoals
citatietellingen kunnen worden gezien als een vorm van beoordeling.
De diversiteit in wetenschappelijke disciplines wordt ook weerspiegeld in
citatiecultuur en kwaliteitsbeoordeling: elke discipline heeft verschillende
normen over kwaliteit. Er is consensus over één aspect: de kwaliteit van
een publicatie moet niet alleen door de auteur worden bepaald. Voldoende

244

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

kwaliteit kan alleen worden bepaald door de peers van de auteur. Gerelateerd aan de kwaliteit van de publicaties is vertrouwen. De meeste lezers
en de bibliotheken en aggregators die namens hen handelen, valideren de
online aangeboden boeken. De vraag is of ze vertrouwen hebben in het
boek en het platform waarop het zich bevindt.
Economische duurzaamheid
Boeken zijn het resultaat van een netwerk van organisaties en individuen.
Dit netwerk moet economisch duurzaam zijn. De economische duurzaamheid van monografieën is echter al tientallen jaren problematisch, lang
voordat de publicatie van Open Access boeken begon. Het valt te betwijfelen
of de economische duurzaamheid van monografieën wordt gegarandeerd
door de verkoop van papieren exemplaren, en de literatuur over kosten lijkt
te suggereren dat een aanzienlijk bedrag nodig is om een academisch boek
te produceren. Zal Open Access publiceren in dergelijke omstandigheden
een positief financieel effect hebben? Open Access had geen groot effect
op de verkoop van monografieën, positief noch negatief. Ik concludeer dat
het hybride model dat Open Access boeken combineert met de verkoop van
“traditionele” papieren boeken niet tot meer verkopen leidt.
Factoren die de verspreiding beïnvloeden
De verspreiding van Open Access monografieën bestaat uit twee delen: een
digitale verzameling en de disseminatie. Elk platform heeft zijn eigen sterke
en zwakke punten en deze zijn essentieel voor het kiezen van een disseminatiestrategie. Online disseminatieplatforms bepalen wat de lezers met het
boek kunnen doen, wat het gebruik ervan beïnvloedt. De gebruiksgegevens
die door het platform worden gegenereerd, kunnen worden gebruikt om de
impact van de boeken op het platform te beoordelen.
De resultaten van hoofdstuk 6 beschrijven een belangrijk aspect van
Open Access disseminatie: het incorporeren in andere systemen verbetert
het monografiegebruik. De OAPEN Library levert metagegevens die door
aggregators kunnen worden gebruikt. Hoewel deze metadata voor iedereen
beschikbaar is – net als de OAPEN Library zelf – kan maar een relatief
klein deel van het gebruik worden toegeschreven aan zoekmachines. De
indexering door zoekmachines is een geautomatiseerd proces, maar de
integratie van de metadata in andere systemen – die informatie verzamelen
voor lezers – is het resultaat van een bewuste keuze. Ik concludeer dat
deze beslissing gebaseerd is op vertrouwen. Aggregators accepteren de
monograf ieën die door de OAPEN-bibliotheek worden aangeboden en
stellen deze beschikbaar aan hun klanten.

In de literatuur over Open Access wordt de rol van licenties uitvoerig
besproken. Hoewel de licentie door velen op het gebied van wetenschappelijke communicatie wordt gezien als een belangrijke voorwaarde voor
Open Access, is het twijfelachtig of de lezers daar net zoveel om geven.
De resultaten lijken te suggereren dat een “free to share”-licentie geen
belangrijke stimulans is in vergelijking met een “free to read”-licentie. Het
aantal downloads werd niet verhoogd door een open licentie, het gebruik
werd versterkt door de integratie van een nieuwe service: DOAB. Ook hier
wordt het gebruik sterk beïnvloed door vertrouwen: een vermelding in
DOAB – een breed vertrouwde bron – resulteert in meer aggregatie en
dus meer zichtbaarheid, wat het gebruik van Open Access monografieën
stimuleert.
Een van de meest prominente succesfactoren van online retailers is de
hoeveelheid kennis die zij bezitten over hun klanten. Als de voorkeuren
van elke klant bekend zijn, is het mogelijk om gewenste producten aan te
bieden. In dergelijke omstandigheden zal de online retailer ernaar streven
zoveel mogelijk gegevens over zijn klanten te verzamelen. Het verzamelen
en opslaan van gegevens over individuen leidt tot discussies over privacy.
Voor bibliotheken is de bescherming van de privacy van hun afnemers
extreem belangrijk.
Ik heb onderzocht of het mogelijk is om geoptimaliseerde aanbevelingen
voor boeken te maken, waarbij bij een minimale hoeveelheid informatie
over individuen wordt opgeslagen. Een mogelijkheid ligt in het analyseren
van het downloadgedrag van alle gebruikers. Door alle gegevens tegelijk
te analyseren, in plaats van te focussen op individuen, is het mogelijk om
patronen te onderscheiden: clusters van gerelateerde boeken die samen
worden gedownload. De clusters worden niet handmatig gemaakt, maar zijn
het resultaat van een algoritme. En dus kan deze procedure deel uitmaken
van een geautomatiseerd proces dat vergelijkbaar is met de aanbevelingsdiensten van online retailers, maar zonder de privacy van individuen te
schenden.
Evaluatie van de resultaten
Leidt publiceren van monografieën in Open Access tot een grotere wetenschappelijke impact en maatschappelijke invloed? Ik heb de sociale impact
van Open Access monografieën onderzocht met behulp van indicatoren
op basis van gebruiksgegevens. Wanneer het gebruik afkomstig is van
overheids-, non-profit- of bedrijfsorganisaties, heb ik dit geclassificeerd
als soorten sociale impact. Een andere indicator van de sociale impact

246

THE DELI V ER A NCE OF OPEN ACCESS BOOKS

van monografieën is te vinden in altmetrics, hier gedefinieerd als online
activiteit over academische publicaties.
Wanneer de gebruikers zijn ingedeeld naar organisatietype, zijn academische gebruikers de grootste groep. De gecombineerde downloadcijfers
van academische organisaties bedragen echter ongeveer 20% van alle
downloads. Met andere woorden: het is mogelijk om de academische impact van Open Access monografieën te laten zien, maar op basis van deze
gegevens is het moeilijk om te concluderen dat Open Access het gebruik van
academici vergroot. Als ik naar sociale impact kijk, wijzen de resultaten op
meer gebruik door diegenen die normaal gesproken niet eenvoudig toegang
krijgen tot wetenschappelijke boeken: niet-academici in “the global north”
en mensen die in ontwikkelingslanden wonen en werken.
Wanneer we citaten zien als een indicatie zijn van wetenschappelijke
impact, wijzen de resultaten op een kleine positieve invloed van Open
Access. Een mogelijke verklaring kan zijn dat een groot deel van de onderzoekers sowieso toegang heeft tot de inhoud. Voor tweets is de situatie
enigszins anders. Net als bij citaten is het gemiddelde aantal tweets over
Open Access monografieën groter dan het aantal tweets over boeken zonder
Open Access. Het verschil is echter niet statistisch significant.
Slotopmerkingen
De rol van wetenschappelijke discipline en taal was te verwachten. Verder is
het duidelijk dat online verspreiding wordt beïnvloed door de infrastructuur
die dit ondersteunt. Dit is goed zichtbaar in de digitale kloof tussen rijke en
minder welvarende landen. Het gebruik van de OAPEN Library en DOAB is
afhankelijk van een veel minder voor de hand liggende factor: vertrouwen.
Een boek online beschikbaar maken leidt niet automatisch tot een optimaal
gebruik. De meeste mensen vertrouwen op filtermechanismen om het kaf
van het koren te scheiden. Deze mechanismen kunnen bibliotheekcatalogi, vermeldingen op sociale media, gespecialiseerde websites of blogs en
nog veel meer mogelijkheden omvatten. Bovendien kunnen de “filters”
afhankelijk zijn van andere bronnen: bibliotheken kunnen bijvoorbeeld
content-aggregators gebruiken.
Uiteindelijk is de beslissing om een Open Access platform te gebruiken
gebaseerd op vertrouwen. Vertrouwen en kwaliteit zijn nauw met elkaar
verbonden: wanneer de aangeboden boeken van voldoende kwaliteit zijn,
zullen de toekomstige lezers – of aggregators – actie ondernemen om een
of meer boeken te verkrijgen. De toekomstige lezers – of de aggregators die
namens hen optreden – moeten ervan uitgaan dat het aanbod van voldoende

SA MEN VATTING

247

kwaliteit is. Met andere woorden, de lezers moeten hun vertrouwen stellen
in de keuzes die het platform maakt.
De conclusie dat Open Access de verkoop van monograf ieën niet
beïnvloedt, is niet erg verrassend. Ik ben betrokken geweest – direct en
indirect – in verschillende experimenten om het effect van Open Access op
monografieverkoop te meten. Geen van deze experimenten resulteerde in
een significante toename of afname van het aantal verkochte exemplaren
voor de reeks Open Access monografieën.
Open Access monografieën worden meer gebruikt in ontwikkelingslanden, een positief resultaat. Een van de doelen van Open Access is het
verbeteren van de toegang voor degenen die anders geen wetenschappelijke
publicaties zouden kunnen lezen.
Samengevat, hoewel Open Access monografieën verspreiding alleen
mogelijk is door paywalls te verwijderen, wordt het gebruiksniveau voornamelijk bepaald door taal, onderwerp, infrastructuur en vertrouwen.
Rekening houdend met de invloed van deze aspecten verbetert Open Access
het gebruik in ontwikkelingslanden en het aantal citaties.
