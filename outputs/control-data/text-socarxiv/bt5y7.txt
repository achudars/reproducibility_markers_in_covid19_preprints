Abstract
Two experiments examined the effects of debate on the attitude of a group. The first
experiment (N = 220, 164 men and 56 women, ages 19 to 21, Japanese) compared the
effects of two discussion styles on attitude change while controlling for in-group
variance. The discussion topic was belief about stereotype, a topic for which Japanese
hold both for and against knowledge. The debate	  condition	  comprised groups of four
people, two of whom were assigned to “Pro” (for) and two to “Con” (against) positions.
The consensus condition comprised groups of four individuals who had to reach a
consensus. The direction of attitude change in the debate condition was opposite to that
in the consensus condition. The second experiment (N = 96, 16 men and 72 women,
ages 19 to 21, Japanese) explored the process of de-polarization observed in the debate
condition during the first experiment. Experiment 2 confirmed the result of Experiment
1 and suggested that the groups in the debate condition produced new information that
group members did not possess before discussion.

Group as a de-polarizer of attitude
“The group as a polarizer of attitude” is the title of a famous paper written by
Moscovici and Zavalloni (1969). Group polarization is defined as exaggeration
increased extremity of the opinions of a group induced by group interaction (Lamm &
Myers, 1978). However, if group process always polarizes people’s attitude, any groups
should reach an extreme point that would not change. Such a status quo is scarcely
observed in our society. During the 20th and 21th centuries, we have observed our
society changing from one direction to another. As shown by the existence of so-called
“swing voters,” which is discussed in the political sciences (Rothschild, Goel, Gelman,
& Rivers, 2014), the majority seems to swing spontaneously.
Some societies cannot easily change their attitudes, whereas others show
prominent changes in the short term. Perhaps societies that avoid conflict among
citizens do not change easily. Nowadays, an autocratic trend is observed in some
societies. If this trend comes from democratic discussion, it is ironic. Even though we
cannot manipulate opinions as researcher’s ethical standards, we should know what
factors lead to change of opinion through disputes. The present paper aims to show that
a conflict in a group process will induce group de-polarization under a certain condition.
De-polarization in disagreeing groups
Studies on group polarization reveal at least four patterns that can emerge in
disagreeing groups.
(a) Polarization is a shift of individual scores toward an extreme direction from
the grand mean. According to Moscovici and Doise (1994), conflictual discussion leads
to a more polarized attitude than does non-conflictual discussion.
(b) Normalization is a convergence of individual scores toward the grand mean.

4

Vinokur and Burnstein (1978) found convergence toward the grand mean when groups
with widely differing opinions are mixed.1
(c) De-polarization is a shift beyond the grand mean toward the opposite
attitude. Research on minority influence (Moscovici, 2001; Moscovici, Mucchi Faina,
& Maass, 1994; Nemeth, 1985) suggests that within-group disagreement induces
innovation or conversion from a previous attitude.
(d) Bipolarization occurs when two extreme groups move in opposite directions
without converging. Paicheler (1976) showed that a stubborn minority can cause
bipolarization.
These varied results suggest that some controlling factors may determine the
direction of attitude change in disagreeing groups. Recently, Gaffney, Rast III, Hackett,
and Hogg (2014) pointed out that the Tea Party movement is a product of identity
confusion. Gaffney et.al (2014) showed that a condition of self-uncertainty enhanced
acceptance of extreme messages to an out-group, while decreasing the acceptance of
them to an in-group. This result suggests that de-polarization can be lead by
within-group process.
The study reported in the present paper tested two hypotheses in two
experiments. The first one is that a conflictual discussion will reduce polarization. The
second hypothesis is that a debate condition will lead to de-polarization due to unshared
information produced during within-group conflict. “Unshared information” is
information held only by one member of a group. Research on discussion style has
obtained clear evidence that a group could communicate more unshared information

Vinokur and Burnstein (1978) called this result de-polarization rather than

normalization, but in the present study, I distinguish between the two.

5

through conflictual discussion than through non-conflictual discussion. For example,
Postmes, Spears, & Cihangir (2001) found that critical norms improved the quality of
group decisions more than consensus norms did, and this effect was mediated by the
perceived value of unshared information.
Common Knowledge Effect
To accomplish the sharing of unshared information, groups should overcome
the common knowledge effect. Stasser and Stewart (1992) showed that groups tend to
overlook unshared information and accept the answer suggested by the shared
information. This common knowledge effect has been considered from the viewpoint of
probability of retrieving shared information (Stasser & Stewart, 1992; Stasser & Titus,
1985; Stewart & Stasser, 1995) or perception to weight shared information (Sargis &
Larson, 2002; Winquist & Larson, 1998).
Studies on group information processing have focused on how to reduce the
shared knowledge effect. Stasser, Stewart, and Wittenbaum (1995) demonstrated that
the performance of group members improved when they noticed discrepancies in the
information they possessed. According to Schulz-Hardt, Brodbeck, Mojzisch,
Kerschreiter, and Frey (2006) , the probability of a correct answer was higher when
there was dissent within the group, even if all of the members’ initial choices were
wrong. Greitemeyer, Schulz-Hardt, Brodbeck, and Frey (2006) also showed how
conflictual discussion increased the probability of unshared information being
produced. These studies suggest that groups can identify unshared information when a
group has disagreement in the course of discussion.
Shared Cognitive Bias
Stasser, Birchmeier, Paulus, and Nijstad (2003) noted the existence of barriers

6

to groups’ creativity even if a group could identify unshared information. For example,
research on confirmation bias has shown that the bias works at both individual and
group levels (Greitemeyer & Schulz-Hardt, 2003; Schulz-Hardt, Frey, Lüthgens, &
Moscovici, 2000). Hinsz, Tindale, and Vollrath (1997) suggested that biases shared
among group members affect their individual responses, leading to group polarization.
Individual judgments are biased by schemas stemming from each knowledge structure,
and if this bias is shared, the group process reinforces it. Sharing information does not
seem to be a sufficient condition to turn the direction of polarization reinforced by
shared cognitive bias.
Instability of Attitude
Implicit attitude theories (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006) have provided
some suggestions regarding how attitudes could change to overcome the common
knowledge effect. Garcia-Marques, Santos, and Mackie (2006) found that stability of
attitudes was relatively low. Considering the low stability of attitudes, recent attitude
theories have proposed that attitude change occurs on two levels: implicit and
conscious. Petty, Tormala, Brinol, and Jarvis (2006) showed that an old attitude had an
implicit influence even after attitude change. Our knowledge structure can contain
implicit memories involving information both supporting and opposing a particular
viewpoint in the course of long-lasting discussions on issues such as global warming or
nuclear energy. If we choose a discussion topic in which both pro and con viewpoints, it
will be possible to observe group de-polarization induced by a conflictual discussion.
Arima (2012) explored the conditions that lead to intragroup disagreement and
changes in attitudes following a disagreement. The results indicated that the probability
of consensus decreased when the mean attitudes of the groups differed from the grand

7

mean of the entire sample. Furthermore, it was found that groups with low within-group
variance that could not reach a consensus showed de-polarization. This result suggested
that if in-group conflict occurs in spite of similar attitudes among group members,
group de-polarization phenomena are more likely.
Based on this result, the Experiment 1 hypothesized that de-polarization would
be observed in a debate condition compared with consensus condition when the distance
between the pro and con parties is small. In the consensus condition, the groups were
required to reach a consensus on the question regarding accuracy in judging personality
based on blood type (Blood-type belief). In the debate condition, participants were
required to debate from their own standpoint (pro or con) assigned to each participant
according to their blood-type belief.
Hypothesis 1: The magnitude of polarization will be smaller in debate
condition than in consensus condition.
Hypothesis 2: In the debate condition, the opposite direction of attitude change
to the polarization will be found when the distance between pro and con parties is small.

Experiment 1
Method
Design. Ex.1 employed a 2 (discussion style: consensus or debate) × 2
(distance: large or small distance between pro- and con- side) factorial design.
Participants. A total of 220 Japanese university students from the department
of business management (164 men and 56 women, aged 19 to 21) participated in 55
same-sex four-person groups. Participants were randomly assigned to the debate or
consensus conditions while keeping the number of groups approximately equal across

8

the distance conditions. Due to missing values, 2 groups were omitted from the analysis.
Analysis was conducted at individual level (n = 212) and group level (each group
means; n = 53 groups). Nineteen groups were allocated to the consensus condition and
34 were allocated to the debate condition.
Discussion topic. The topic chosen for the discussion was blood-type
stereotype. Blood-type stereotype is a belief that a certain personality is tied to a certain
blood type. Scientists have refuted this belief, as no evidence has been found to support
such a relationship. Most Japanese people are familiar with both blood-type stereotype
and scientific arguments that go against it. Therefore, participants in this study can be
expected to possess conflicting implicit attitudes. This preposition is to be confirmed by
the contents of free-writings before discussion, which will be part of Experiment 2.
Procedure. APA ethical standards were followed in the conduct of the study.
The experimenter explained the procedure before experiment. The participants were
told that they could leave anytime in the course of experiments, or, leave the
questionnaire blank if they would like to join without being analyzed. After the
experiment, they were provided the information about this study.
Before and after the group discussions, participants were asked to estimate
their belief in blood-type stereotype. : “How accurate is a judgment based on blood
type?” (Belief score). On the same questionnaire, they are required to guess the
percentage of their peers who made the same choice. : “Please estimate the percentage
of participants who hold the same belief as you” (Perceived similarity). Perceived
similarity was defined as the estimated percentage of respondents who gave the same
answer as the main respondent (range: 0–100).
Participants were assigned to “pro” or “con” sides depending on their Belief

9

Score and were allocated to the small- or large-distance condition. “Distance score”
refers to differences between the means of belief scores at “pro” and “con” sides of each
group. Large-distance groups had distance scores greater than 2.0 on the 7-point scale.
In the small-distance groups, the score was smaller than 2.0.
Each discussion table was numbered and had two pro and two con seats. The
participants in the consensus condition were not informed their pro or con sides in a
group. Each participant was assigned a seat at a table. A “pro” or “con” sign was
displayed on each table in the debate condition, but these were hidden in the consensus
condition. The discussion time was not limited in either condition. After the
experimenter confirmed that all group discussions were over, the participants were
asked to move away from one another. The experimenters then administered the
post-discussion questionnaire that asked about beliefs in blood-type stereotype and
perceived similarity again. At the end of the experiment, the participants were debriefed
and thanked for their participation.
Results and Discussion
Pre-belief scores. Table 1 shows the means of pre-, post-, and shift scores for
each condition. The mean of the pre-belief score was 4.24 (SD = .76), indicating that
participants’ initial mean tendency was pro-side for the belief in blood-type stereotype.
The SD of pre-belief was 1.40 for the participants (n = 212) and .76 for the means of the
discussion groups (n = 53). Pre-belief scores did not differ significantly between the
consensus and debate conditions. The range of distance scores was 0 to 4.5, and the
mean was 1.75 (SD = 1.28). The pre-belief score between the large- and small-distance
conditions differed significantly (F(1, 210) = 32.11, p < .001, partialη2=.13). The mean
of the large-distance groups was 3.71 and that of the small-variance groups was 4.73.

10

This difference is because a relatively small number of participants with low belief
score had to be assigned to the large-variance groups.
Mean pre-discussion perceived similarity was 38.24 (n = 212; SD = 23.22),
indicating that the participants perceived that approximately 38% of the participants
shared their belief. No significant differences emerged in pre-discussion perceived
similarity scores between the consensus and debate conditions or between the large- and
small-distance groups.
The mean perceived similarity was 31.2 for participants who did not believe in
the blood-type stereotype (pre-belief < 4; n = 49), 35.3 for participants with a neutral
attitude (pre-belief = 4; n = 41), and 42.06 for participants who believed in blood-type
stereotype (pre-belief > 5; n = 122). The perceived similarity differs among these three
groups significantly, F(2, 209) = 4.39, p = .014, partialη2 = .04 . The participants who
did not believe in the blood-type stereotype believed that they were in the minority.
Effect of conditions on shift score. Shift scores of each participant were
calculated by subtracting the pre-belief from the post-belief scores. There are three
levels of data. The first one is individual data, the second is means of each party in
discussion groups, and the last one is means of each discussion group. The analysis of
the hypothesis of experiment 1 used the last one, the means of each discussion
group. In order to analyze data at all three levels, a hierarchal linear model
(HLM) using a mixed model in SPSS was added.
A 2 (discussion style: consensus vs. debate) × 2 (distance: large vs. small
distance between pro and con beliefs) ANOVA on discussion group’s shift scores found
a significant interaction between discussion style and distance, F(1, 47) = 8.10, p
= .007, partialη2 = .15. The main effect of discussion predicted in hypothesis 1, was not

11

significant. The interaction effect, as predicted hypothesis 2, was significant. A
regression analysis using distance scores as continuous variables confirmed the
interaction between condition and distance scores (β =.70, t = 2.79, p = .008, R2 = .17).
Figure 1 displays the shift scores in each condition. A multiple comparison test
for group’s shift scores showed a significant difference between the small- and
large-distance groups in the debate condition (M = .79, 95% CI [.15, 1.42], p = .018).
Also, there was significant difference between the consensus and debate condition in the
small distance condition (M = .92, CI [.20, 1.65]. p= .014). As shown in Table 1,
Within-group t-test found a significant shift from pre- to post-belief in the large distance
groups in the consensus condition (t (8) = 2.65, p = .029, r = .68 ), and the
small-distance groups in the debate condition, t(16) = 3.31, p = .004, r = .76.
These results support hypothesis 2. If polarization occurred, the small distance
groups (pre-belief = 4.73) should shift toward the plus direction and large distance
groups (pre-belief = 3.71) should shift toward the minus direction. The results of the
consensus condition followed the directions predicted in group polarization; however,
the directions of shift in the debate condition were the reverse of those for the consensus
condition. Nevertheless, because the difference between small- and large-distance
conditions might be confounded with condition, hypothesis 2 should be retested in
experiment 2. Moreover, there was a general tendency of de-polarization rather than
polarization in Experiment 1. To investigate what party (pro or con) induced
de-polarization, hierarchical analysis was conducted as an additional analysis.
Additional analysis. An HLM on shift score with random effect of pre-belief
scores in each party (pro and con) and group, yielded a significant main effect of
discussion style condition (F (1,159.33) = 9.96, p = .002); an interaction effect between

12

discussion style and party, (F (1, 172.35) = 3.58, p = .030); and an interaction effect
between discussion style and group, F(1, 176.51) = 4.42, p = .013, AIC = 634.07,
intra-class correlation of shift score =.22.
Figure 2 depicts the mean shift scores of pro- and con-sides in the debate
condition. In large distance groups, the pro-side shifted to the con-direction, and the
con-side shifted to the pro-direction. On the other hand, the pro-and con-side shifted
together to the same direction in small distance groups. In the consensus condition, the
small distance groups shifted toward the pro direction, consistent with their initial mean
tendency. In the debate condition, however, small distance groups shifted toward the
con-side, contrary to their initial mean tendency.
Perceived similarity. Figure 3 depicts shifts from pre-perceived similarity to
post-perceived similarity. A 2 (discussion style: consensus vs. debate) × 2 (distance:
large vs. small) ANOVA found a significant interaction between discussion style and
variance, F(1, 47) = 8.55, p = .005, partialη2 = .15. A multiple comparison test for
group shift scores showed a significant difference between the small and large-distance
groups in the debate condition (M = 11.97, 95% CI [2.56, 21.38], p = .014). Also, there
was significant difference between the consensus and debate condition in the large
distance condition (M = 16.41, CI [5.21, 27.61]. p = .005). As shown in Table 1,
Within-group t-test found a significant shift from pre- to post-belief in the large distance
groups in the debate condition (t (14) = -3.9, p = .002, r = .72 ).
Known as the false consensus effect (Ross, Greene, & House, 1977), perceived
similarity of others with one’s own choice tends to be larger than the real percentage. If
group de-polarization is induced by a need for group inclusiveness (Brewer & Roccas,
2001), then perceived similarity should increase after discussion. On the contrary, if

13

perceived similarity decreases after discussion, then de-polarization would be due to a
need for distinctiveness from others. This result showed that de-polarization in the
small-distance debate groups did not shift toward the perceived position of the majority,
as it did in the large-distance debate groups. It suggests that group de-polarization is not
conformity to the majority.

Experiment 2
The results of Experiment 1 should be retested in Experiment 2 because
differences in pre-belief between the small- and large-distance groups could have
confounded the findings. Furthermore, to explore the process of attitude de-polarization
observed in small-distance groups, Experiment 2 investigated the influence of unshared
information acquired during discussion.
In Experiment 2, only the debate condition was conducted. Participants were
asked to list the pros and cons of the blood-type stereotype before the discussion. After
the discussion, they were asked to list the new information that they had learned during
the discussion. If information not recalled by any group members before the discussion
became available after the discussion, then de-polarization could be understand as an
alteration of knowledge structure.
Hypothesis 1: Group de-polarization will be observed in the small-distance
debate groups.
Hypothesis 2: Small-distance debate groups will produce more information
than large-distance debate groups.
Method
Participants. Ninety-six Japanese students from two institutions participated in

14

this study. Students from the psychology department of a university (aged 19–21)
participated in the study as part of their psychology course. Students from the secretarial
department of a women’s college (aged 19–20) participated in this experiment as part of
their psychology class. A week before the experiment, the participants completed a
pre-discussion questionnaire that asked about how accurate the “blood-type stereotype”
is on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not accurate at all) to 7 (very accurate).
Participants were allocated to small- or large-distance groups. Large-distance groups
had differences between the means of the pro and con participants set at greater than 2.0
(M = 3.10, SD = .77). In the small-distance groups, the difference between the means of
the pro and con participants was set at less than 2.0 (M = .42, SD = .40). Any groups
with a member absent in the first or second week were excluded from the data analysis,
leaving 88 participants (16 men, 72 women).
Procedure. Experiment 2 followed the procedure of the debate condition in
Experiment 1, except for the following procedure. After measuring pre-belief scores one
week before the experiment, participants were given 15 minutes to respond to the
following statement: “There are pro and con arguments about the blood-type stereotype.
Please write down as much as you know about blood-type and personality, and divide
them into pro and con arguments.” The post-discussion questionnaire asked the
participants to: “Please write down the new information that you obtained from this
discussion and divide them into pro and con arguments.”
In the large-distance groups, the difference between the means of the pro and
con sides was more than 2.0 (M = 2.94, SD = 0.75). In the small-distance groups, the
difference between the means of the pro and con sides was less than 2.0 (M = 0.79, SD
= 0.65). The difference in pre- belief score between small and large distance conditions

15

was non-significant.
Dependent variables. The number of Japanese characters written during
pre-discussion was termed “pro- or con-knowledge” while the list written at
post-discussion was termed “information.” In addition to the number of characters, the
number of statements was also counted: a sentence comprising subject-verb-object was
counted as one statement. For example, the sentence “People with Type A blood are
sincere, but people with Type B blood are capricious” would be counted as two
statements. The statements were then classified into three categories, namely “shared,”
“unshared,” and “novel.” Shared information category comprised statements written by
more than two group members. Unshared information category comprised statements
written by individual members but not by other group members. Novel information
included statements written during post-discussion but not pre-discussion by any group
members.
Results and Discussion
Pre-belief scores. The SDs obtained were 1.24 for the participants (n = 88)
and .76 for the groups (n = 22). The mean of the large-distance groups was 4.33, and
that of the small-distance groups was 4.75. Variance ranged from 0 to 4.5, with the
mean being 1.61 (SD = 1.45). The difference in pre-belief scores between psychology
students (M = 4.13, SD = 1.39) and secretarial students (M = 4.80, SD = 1.09) was
significant, t (86) = −2.55, p = .013, d = .56; nonetheless, the initial mean tendencies
indicated pro-direction in both affiliations. No significant differences were found in
pre-belief score between large and small distance groups for either affiliation.
The mean number of Japanese characters produced by participants who
believed in the blood-type stereotype before discussion (pro-knowledge) was 33.28 (SD

16

= 22.85), and the mean of con-knowledge was 37.43 (SD = 26.88). No significant
differences were found in pro- or con-knowledge between small- and large-variance
groups.
Effect of distance on shift scores. The pre- and post-belief scores of
groups were significantly different in the small-distance groups, t (11) = 3.03,

p = .011, r = .68, mean of group shift = .90, 95% CI [0.25, 1.56], but not in the
large-distance groups. A regression analysis confirmed the effect of distance score
on shift score (β = .27, t = 2.55, p = .012, R2 = .07). An HLM on shift score with
random effect of group yielded a significant main effect of distance (F (1, 84.76) = 4.94,
p = .029) and an interaction effect between distance and group F (1, 188.11) = 5.44, p
= .021), AIC = 277.17. An HLM on shift score with random effect of group and party,
yielded a significant main effect of distance (F (1, 78.864) = 4.32, p = .041) and an
interaction effect between distance, group and party F (1, 84.47) = 4.18, p = .044), AIC
= 279.97, intra-class correlation of shift score =.38.
Considering the significant difference in pre-belief between psychology
students and secretarial Students, affiliation was introduced to the regression: however,
affiliation had no effect on shift score. Thus, Hypothesis 1, which predicted that attitude
de-polarization would occur in small-distance groups in the debate condition, was
supported.
Effect of distance on information production during discussion. An HLM
on the amount of unshared information with random effect of pre-belief scores in each
group, yielded a significant main effect of distance (F (1,81.91) = 5.26, p = .024) and an
interaction effect between distance and group F (1, 86.81) = 4.26, p = .042), AIC =
860.94, intra-class correlation of shift score =.30. An HLM on the amount of novel

17

information with random effect of group, yielded a significant main effect of distance (F
(1, 75.53) = 4.83, p = .031), AIC = 864.82, intra-class correlation of shift score =.48.
Figure 4 shows the total amount of unshared and novel information gained
through group discussion for each distance condition. The small-distance groups gained
more information (both shared and novel) than did the large-distance groups. Thus,
Hypothesis 2, which predicted that small-distance groups would produce new
information compared to large-distance groups, was supported.
Additional analysis: Path analysis. Path analysis was conducted with
group-level data using AMOS program. The following variables were included in the
analysis: pre-discussion means for each group (PreMean), pre-test variance for each
group (PreSD), post-test mean for each group (PostMean), pro shared information
before discussion (ProShared), con shared information before discussion (ConShared),
con novel information produced during discussion (ConNovel), and pro novel
information produced during discussion (ProNovel). Figure 5 presents the results of the
path analysis.

General Discussion
The results of two experiments confirmed that group de-polarization was
observed when members with similar attitudes engaged in conflictive discussion. The
hypothesis 1 in Ex.1 was not supported because the mean of shift score was the same in
consensus and debate condition, however, there was a clear interaction effect between
discussion style and distance condition. In the consensus condition, the large distance
between pro and con parties induced polarization, while the small distance between
them induced de-polarization in debate condition. This result support hypothesis 2 in

18

Ex.1. Employing only debate condition, Ex.2 confirmed the result of Ex.1. Group
de-polarization will be observed in the small-distance debate groups.
Ex.2 also supported the hypothesis 2 of Ex.2. A content analysis of Experiment
2 showed that small-distance groups provided more unshared and novel information
than did large distance groups. According to the path analysis, pro-side shared
knowledge had an effect on group polarization.
The participants in Experiment 2 were psychology and secretarial students.
Before discussion, psychology students had more con-side knowledge than did
secretarial students. However, after discussion, the psychology students were more
likely to acquire pro-side rather than con-side information from their debate while the
opposite was true for the secretarial students. This result suggests that the two groups of
participants’ knowledge became more similar, even though the experiment was
conducted separately in the two institutions. This phenomena seems to reflect the effect
of pooling information in population as predicted by informational influence theory
(Burnstein & Vinokur, 1977). Regardless of mean attitude in each small group, the
direction of polarization follows the direction indicated by the population(Lamm &
Myers, 1978).

On the other hand, con-side shared information did not have a direct influence
in path-analysis. However, low within-group variance produced novel con-side
information, resulting in attitude de-polarization. During debate, participants would
produce an opinion different from that of the opposing party. If an opposing party has
similar attitude to one’s own party, then they must create new reasoning by using
information not recalled before the discussion. This process seemed to influence one’s
own attitude, known as the audience-tuning effect (Echterhoff, Higgins, & Groll, 2005).

19

Echterhoff et al. (2005) suggested that message production alters one’s own attitude
even if the message was different from one’s initial attitude.
The assumption of de-polarization is that people have both pro and con
knowledge beforehand. On the basis of complexity in shared knowledge,
de-polarization will take place through disputing among similar people. The trend of
opinion is determined by the pooping information among people at present. Resisting
people would not avoid the effect from population. It is more difficult for a group than
for an individual to switch to a different viewpoint, because a group must keep a shared
cognitive schema in order to communicate with each other. However, the trend may turn
when the attitude among people reach to too similar state. To make this happen, we
needs not only unshared information but also cognitive complexities in order to
restructure one’s knowledge.

Figure 1. Effect of condition on shift score. Vertical scale indicates shift score
(pre-belief score – post belief score). Negative direction of shift score means groups
moved toward unbelief for blood-type stereotype. There was significant de-polarization
in the small distance groups when they adapt debate style discussion.

Figure 4. Effect of distance on the amount of information produced through debate.
The vertical scale indicates the amount of information gained through debate
discussion. The unshared information means information that all members did not write
before discussion. The novel information means information that none of group
members wrote before discussion. For both unshared and novel information, the small
distance groups produced more information through discussion.

Figure 5. Path analysis results. χ2 (13) = 15.04, p = .305, CFI = .853, AIC = 59.04.
Significant betas were obtained for the paths from PreMean to PostMean (β= .44, p
< .01) and from ConNovel to PostMean (β = −0.52, p < .01). A marginally significant
path was obtained from PreSD to ConNovel (β = −0.34, p < .10). All other paths were
non-significant.
