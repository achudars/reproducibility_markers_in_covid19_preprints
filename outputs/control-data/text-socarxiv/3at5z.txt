Abstract
Scientists and policymakers recognize the need to address consumption and lifestyles in order
to reconcile environmental and development agendas. Sustainability-oriented grassroots
initiatives emerge bottom-up to create opportunities for sustainable lifestyles; yet no prior
assessment has ascertained the efficacy of their members to reduce carbon footprints (CF)
and enhance well-being. We compare the CF of non-members and members of grassroots
initiatives in the domains of food, clothing, housing and transport. We further compare the
groups by testing the influence of socio-economic variables that are typically associated with
both footprint and well-being. Here we show that grassroots initiative members have 16%
lower total carbon footprint, and 43% and 86% lower carbon footprints for food and clothing
respectively, compared to their “non-member” regional socio-demographic counterparts.
We find a higher adoption of some energy-saving behaviors for initiative members such as
greater active travel distance and lower indoor temperatures in the winter, yet no significant
differences in the CF of housing and transport. Interestingly, increases in income are not
associated with increases in the total CF of members, while the influence of income is
confirmed for the CF of the total sample. Instead, factors such as age, household size, and
gender better explain the variation in the domain-specific CFs of initiative members. Finally,
members show higher life satisfaction compared to non-members and are 11-13% more likely
to evaluate their life positively. Our results suggest that initiative members uncover lifestyle
features that not only enable lower emissions, but also reconcile emissions with income and
well-being.

Introduction

With the United Nation’s 12th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Responsible Production
and Consumption, the global community aims to reconcile the goals of economic development
(SDG8) and environmental protection (SDG12-15)1. Thus far, the global rise in income and
consumption has driven environmental impact with a strength that can hardly be offset by
technological progress2,3. Furthermore, while technical progress may increase resource efficiency,
it can also lead to undesirable rebound effects –i.e., increases in total consumption which diminish
the mitigation potential from efficiency gains4.
The notion of “green growth” assumes that economic growth could be decoupled from greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions via sustainable resource management, strong abatement and efficient
resource use5,6. The decoupling pursuit is endorsed by simulation-based research and influential
policy agendas5,6. Nevertheless, empirical evidence over the past decades shows that no nation has
achieved absolute decoupling and that most reported evidence has either overlooked problemshifting to other resources or countries7,8.
As a response to realizing the limits of “green growth” via decoupling9,10, alternative models such
as “living well” (Sumac Kawsay) in the Global South and “sustainable de-growth” in the Global
North, have gained traction across academic, policy and civil spheres11–13. Their core assumption
is that “a good life can be decoupled from environmental damage” 11,12,14. Their common proposal
is to satisfy fundamental human needs directly by endorsing goods and practices that effectively
reconcile higher well-being with reduced impact14–16. Sustainability-focused grassroots initiatives
are suggested to have a role towards this end. Nevertheless, their potential to enable lifestyles of
lower impact and higher well-being has not been fully understood17–19.

The potential and constraints of lifestyle changes

Given that household consumption drives about 65% of global GHG emissions20, there is a major
interest in embedding demand-side solutions into climate change mitigation strategies4,21.
Examples of consumer-oriented policies include creating economic4 and non-economic22,23
incentives to adopt low-impact behaviors, social norm-based interventions which normalize
sustainable practices24, behavioral ‘nudges’ that make low-impact choices the default option10,21,
and locking-in desirable practices through adequate infrastructures. However, consumer-side
policy interventions have their own pitfalls. They can be costly and short-lived if they do not hit
the deepest leverage points of social transformation25–27: the underpinning values, goals, intrinsic
motivations22 and world views that govern society24,26.
Even individuals with pro-environmental orientations may be ineffective at reducing their CF due
to the dominant influence of socio-economic factors on consumption levels28–30. Particularly, they
may focus on behaviors that are easy to adopt, but have relatively small impact28,31 e.g., recycling.
Typically, the available voluntary lifestyle changes are often limited to consumption of less harmful
goods or “green consumption”10,32, and constrained by institutional, infrastructural and behavioral
lock-ins30,33,34. Furthermore, only a massive adoption of lifestyle changes would represent a serious
contribution towards keeping within 1.5°C trajectories35,36. For these and other reasons, pro-

environmental knowledge31,37, attitudes28,37 and even behaviors38 are no guarantee of substantial
impact reductions28,31,38.

Sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives

Sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives are bottom-up networks of individuals and
organizations with an overarching agenda of social and environmental well-being9,10. They are
fueled by volunteers and function through social learning by sharing new practices and skills
among members37. The sustainability causes sought by grassroots initiatives vary widely.
Initiatives can be specialized, such as food and energy cooperatives, or comprehensive, such as the
Transition Town Movements39 and eco-villages37. Some initiatives focus on satisfying needs
beyond market offer by taking a role of “prosumers” and producing the goods they wish to
consume10,37. Other try to modify or extract themselves from current structural hurdles37. Overall,
all initiatives attempt to create alternative social practices that best align with the values and
envisioned lifestyles pursued by their members10,40,41.
Grassroots initiatives can influence society on multiple levels37. At the individual level, initiatives
offer knowledge, role-models and social support to adopt sustainable lifestyles while satisfying
needs10,42. At the group or network level, they enrich social capital by spurring social learning17,37,
mobilizing for environmental citizenship32 and incubating innovation niches17,34. At the societal
level, they can influence the underlying rules and norms, creating a supportive normative context
for sustainable policies24,26. When successful, grassroots initiatives operate at the deepest leverage
points25, challenge current paradigms26, and empower individual and collective capacity towards
sustainability transformation26,43.
Indeed, previous research indicates that grassroots initiatives play a role in sustainability
transitions10,17,26,32,37,39 by providing counter-narratives of economic development with an
embedded perspective of intrinsic motivations, values underpinning social relations and pathways
to sustainable lifestyles44,45.
In this sense, grassroots initiatives can foster voluntary simplicity. Contrary to the notion that
consumption determines well-being9,16, proponents of lifestyles driven by voluntary simplicity
argue for a “double dividend”: simultaneously reducing consumption while enhancing wellbeing9,16,40. Previous studies suggest that participation in grassroots initiatives could be linked to
increased awareness and pro-environmental behaviors, while supporting individuals in the pursuit
of well-being46–48 and quality of social life40,41,44.

Previous research on members of grassroots initiatives

Members of environmental organizations have been reported to perform pro-environmental
behaviors more frequently than the general public49,50. As a variable, group membership captures
the relevant social context in which individuals develop or re-inforce environmental attitudes,
habits and lifestyles50. However, few studies assess the environmental impact of members and they
do so through assessing behavior28,29,41 or direct energy use49, overlooking that (pro-environmental)
behaviors are not always the ones associated with the highest environmental impacts i.e., the socalled behavior-impact gap28,38. Furthermore, previous research has been limited to study active

and passive members of broadly defined environmental organizations, ranging from multi-national
non-governmental organizations to charities29,31,41,50.
Early research suggested a positive associating between activism and well-being47, and between
lower ecological footprint and higher well-being i.e. voluntary simplicity40,51,52. However, there is
a lack of comprehensive and quantitative assessments on the environmental impact and well-being
of members of grassroots initiatives17,39,47,53, with the vast majority of related studies either
undertaking a theoretical approach17,19,43,53,54 or focusing solely on intentional communities48,53,55.
A recent systematic review compared the environmental impact of regular citizens to inhabitants
of intentional communities, such as ecovillages and co-housing communities established with the
explicit goal of reducing environmental impact53. The review found an average of 35% lower
emissions for members53 -while none of the covered studies controlled for socio-economic
differences53. Further, the review included a wide range of geographies and combined carbon
metrics, with only two studies based on CO2-equivalents but not through a lifecycle approach53.
Another study on members that voluntarily limit their carbon allowance coincidentally also found
a 35% reduction with respect to UK average, but the participants calculated their own footprint
using diverse carbon accounting methods54. Grinde et al reported the potential of intentional
communities to reconcile higher mental well-being with lower income, despite higher education55.
Mulder et al found higher well-being and lower material throughput for members of intentional
communities, although their impact assessment was limited to transport48.
The GLAMURS (Green Lifestyles, Alternative Models and Upscaling Regional Sustainability) 1
project applied an interdisciplinary approach to research the main obstacles and prospects for
sustainable lifestyles in Europe at national20, regional2 and individual levels30 –including
participatory modelling with stakeholders to quantify the potential of lifestyle changes35.
Empirically, the project conducted action research with grassroots initiatives56 and applied a
comprehensive survey to compare the lifestyles of non-members with the lifestyles of members of
local sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives56. In this study, we used the GLAMURS survey
to test for evidence of voluntary simplicity by exploring the carbon footprint and well-being of
members of grassroots initiatives. We advance from behavioral proxies and direct energy use by
estimating the carbon footprint embodied in the most impactful consumption domains2,20, covering
both direct energy use and indirect impacts through purchase of goods and services. Noteworthy,
we do not test for causality between joining an initiative and environmental or well-being
outcomes. Rather, we test for observable carbon and life satisfaction differences between members
and non-members, while controlling for relevant socio-demographic factors.

Data
Here we analyzed the CF of 141 moderately to highly engaged adult members of 12 sustainabilityfocused grassroots initiatives located in Italy, Germany, Romania and Spain. The chosen regions
lie in close proximity to the research teams of the GLAMURS project and represent a diversity of
economic, cultural and geographical contexts. As a sample, they provide an opportunity to
investigate sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives spanning different issues, ambitions and

lifestyle domains across Europe. The studied initiatives include food and clothing cooperatives,
eco-villages and the Transition Town Movement. We evaluated the individual CF and life
satisfaction of initiative members and compared them to non-members sampled from the same
geographical regions (N=1,476).
In this study, the concept of “sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives” refers to groups or
networks of individuals and organizations engaged in any of the SDGs9,10 with an overarching
agenda of social and environmental well-being. In this study, all the sampled initiatives share a
focus on the SDG12 of Responsible consumption and production (Table 1). The set of initiatives
were selected in order to include both comprehensive lifestyle change initiatives (e.g., eco-villages,
Transition Town) as well as issue-based initiatives (e.g., food cooperatives, sustainable
consumption). Some limitations with regards to initiative representativeness and initiative focus
are discussed in the section on “Limitations and future work”.
We based our analysis on a self-reported survey which captured demographic variables, socioeconomic status, expenditure, environmentally relevant behaviors, living standards, and life
satisfaction. We calculated the embodied CF of food, clothing, housing and transport from
expenditure, travel and dietary surveys, and housing conditions. We controlled for socio-economic
and demographic variables to compare groups through a multiple regression analysis. Finally, we
used evaluations of life satisfaction to assess well-being across groups and in relation to CF. The
methods and Supplementary Information (SI) contain further detail about the samples, survey items
and CF calculations (SI1-3).

Samples

The sample of non-members (N=1,476) were adult inhabitants from the regions of Galicia (Spain),
Banat-Timis (Romania), Lazio (Italy) and Saxony-Anhalt (Germany). The initiative sample
(N=141) included 12 grassroots initiatives with varying sustainability focus. The sample of
initiative members in Galicia included 59 members from the food cooperative Zocamiñoca (n=40),
and Amarante Setem (n=13), and Equus Zebra (n=6), which focus on food and clothing
consumption. The sample from Banat-Timis included 20 members from Aurora and Amonia
Brassovia eco-villages. The sample for Lazio included a network of agricultural and food
cooperatives with focus on food consumption and regional production of organic food (n=27).The
initiative sample from Saxony-Anhalt comprise 35 members from Transition Town Halle (n=21)
and Lebensmittel retten Magdeburg (n=14), where the former is of an extensive scope while the
latter focuses on sustainable food consumption and food waste prevention. See SI1 for details
about initiative scope and activities.

The members from the initiatives were recruited through electronic mailing lists referred by fellow
members. The non-member sample was recruited in a multi-stage process with a phase of
contacting participants via a snowball-system (ES, RO and IT) and an external contractor (DE).
Thus, there may be some demographic representation bias associated with the recruitment of our
samples. Compared to regional official statistics, our non-member sample appear to over-represent
females and younger people. Females are generally associated with lower food- and transportrelated emissions30 meaning that we may misestimate the average emission levels in these domains.
Age is positively associated with food- and housing-related emissions, and negatively associated
with mobility emissions30. See SI1 for a detailed discussion on the representativeness of our nonmember samples.

Survey

We developed a standardized questionnaire to gather self-reported data on environmentally
relevant behaviors, consumption, socio-economic and demographic status, life satisfaction and
living standards. The survey was first set up in English, followed by translations and adaptations
to the official languages of each region. Most items of the questionnaire were kept identical, with
regional adaptations being included for socio-demographic variables, in order to respect the
contextual conditions of each region.

We ran a pilot study in the regions of Galicia (n=94) and Saxony-Anhalt (n=50) in order to test for
clarity, comprehension and validity of items. The final survey was distributed as an online
questionnaire between the months of December 2015 and February 2016. Additional detail on the
survey can be found in SI2.
Self-reported data may be a subject to bias when respondents align responses with social norms or
identity50,57. However, we did not expect this bias to substantially influence our results. First, the
carbon footprints at the domain level are not based of single-item measures but rather combine
multiple diverse variables (SI3). Additionally, the survey included cross-check items to test for
coherence and bias (e.g., annual kilometers registered in the odometer should approximate weekly
car travel survey). Thus, for a domain-level result to be critically biased, a diverse set of behaviors,
household characteristics and consumption activities would have to be manipulated by a large
number of respondents. We expect the potential self-reporting biases towards socially desirable
behavior to be relatively consistent across respondents31.
We used the Satisfaction with Life scale to measure the cognitive component of subjective wellbeing. The scale consists of five life satisfaction (LS) items (LS1-5). It was developed to indicate
overall subjective life satisfaction beyond objective indicators of material well-being58. The
following statements were evaluated by respondents with a seven point scale from (1) Totally
Disagree to (7) Totally agree: LS1: In most ways my life is close to ideal, LS2: The conditions of
my life are excellent, LS3:I am satisfied with my life, LS4:So far I have gotten the important things
I want in life, LS5:If I could live my life over again, I would change almost nothing. Variable scales
and definitions are documented in the SI4.
Comparing individuals through subjective well-being indicators is subject to the caveats of crosscultural analysis, where cultures and worldviews influence self-assessments59. However, the LS
indicator has been widely tested and proven robust12,14, especially for comparing groups of similar
cultural background60,61. We choose to analyze the individual items instead of aggregating the LS
scale, which has been suggested for greater transparency of results61.

Methods
Carbon footprint

We designed a carbon footprint (CF) model to capture most of the GHG emissions, according to
prior carbon assessments of household consumption in the European Union2,20.We quantify the CF
of food, clothing, housing and mobility, domains that capture the majority of household
environmental impacts in Europe2,20. Due to survey length constraints, we did not capture details
on the consumption of manufactured products and services, as these categories are composed of a
wide range of goods (e.g., education, insurances, computers, white goods, etc.). Omitting
manufactured products and services, our assessment encompasses between 65-81% of total
household CF across the studied geographical areas2. Our calculations were not based on one type
of measure, but on considering behavioral, living standards and expenditure variables, as described
below and at length in SI3.
We calculated the carbon footprint of food based on dietary habits and weekly frequency of
consumption of certain food products. We then approximated daily intake estimates by using the

EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption database62, which reports country-specific
data on kilograms of food product intake per kilograms of body mass (e.g., meat, dairy products,
vegetables and fruits)62 and normalized with the respondents’ weight to approximate food intake
by product63. We disregarded metabolic differences for sexes, activity levels and age cohorts,
which could be incorporated in future assessments63. We conducted a literature review on lifecycle
assessments to calculate product-specific carbon intensities per kilogram of product intake to
calculate the individual carbon footprint of food intake per person. We used expenditure on storebought food to estimate the impacts associated with the food products that were not covered directly
in the survey: processed food, fish, beverages and dry legumes. We coupled expenditure on these
items with regionalized monetary carbon intensities from EXIOBASE2.32,64 (see SI3 for further
detail). We enquired about regular clothing spending and applied regionalized monetary carbon
intensities2 while discounting the share of second-hand consumption, and thus assigning impacts
only to purchases of new clothing.
Electricity impacts were derived from reported monthly payments in winter and summers, prices
per kWh and country-level carbon intensities from Eco-Invent2.265. We used a model for space
heating based on climate and building characteristics. We derived the effects from typical energy
demand in archetypical buildings in Europe, reported by the TABULA project66. Theoretical
energy demand (kWh/m2-annum) was estimated based on the (1) type of house, (2) year of
construction, (3) level of insulation and (4) climate zone of the region. Total space heating needs
per person were calculated according to dwelling surface and normalized per person according to
household size. The hot water demand was calculated in function of occupants for a European
household. GHG emissions of hot water and space heating consider the heating technologies and
fuels used by the household66. See SI3 for details on housing energy calculations and emission
factors.
We based transport footprints on air and land travel. Respondents reported weekly travel patterns,
specific transport mode for each trip, number of return trips, approximate distance per trip, purpose
of the commute (work vs private trips), and carpooling. Air travel was based on annual number of
short- and long-haul flights. We derived lifecycle multipliers per km-passenger from a literature
review to apply to transport mode. We calculated specific emission factors per kilometer for private
vehicles considering vehicle type, size and fuel (see SI for further detail). We calculated annual CF
per capita in 2015 in carbon equivalents (see SI3). The magnitude and shares of calculated
emissions across consumption domains align with previous top-down regional assessments2. We
reported all data exclusions, measures, footprint validations, and input data for the footprint model
in the SI3.

Analysis

Because all the initiatives share a focus on working towards the SDG12 by engaging in sustainable
consumption, we study members of all these initiatives as a group. We do so by controlling for
socio-economic variables and country differences, in order to isolate the effect of initiative
membership. We used descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests of central
tendencies, and multiple regression modelling to compare differences between initiative members
and control regions in terms of individual CF. We examined the distribution of CF by consumption
domains across initiative members and non-members, and across geographical areas (see SI4). We
particularly examined the means and 95% Confidence Intervals and tested the CF difference using

a set of one-sided two-sample t-tests. In addition, we performed Wilcoxon rank-sum test and a nonparametric test on the equality of the medians to address concerns about differences in sample sizes
(see SI4), and propensity score matching analysis (see SI5).
We further examined the INITIATIVE effect when controlling for socio-demographics and country
fixed effects (ES, RO, IT). We performed OLS multiple regression analyses2,20 using Stata 14 on
a domain (Table 2) and sub-domain level (SI5). See SI4 and SI5 for variable definitions and model
specification. We included logarithm transformed footprint values as dependent variables to tackle
systematic obtain normal residuals (SI5). Furthermore, a log-transformation may be especially
meaningful as different geographical regions in our sample are associated with substantially
different footprints, which encouraged us to communicate marginal changes in percentage terms
rather than in absolute magnitudes. The analysis was performed on annual per capita footprints.
We examined main assumptions behind the regression analysis, analyzed pairwise correlations and
multicollinearity, and measured practical and statistical significance of the INITIATIVE effect
using multiple smile plots by geographical area (see SI5). The specified model is as follows, where
CF estimates vary by consumption domain:
�𝚤𝚤 �

Finally, we conducted ordinal logistic (logit) regressions using each life satisfaction items as the
dependent variable to examine the effect of initiative membership on well-being (see SI5 for
assumptions, odds ratios and average marginal effects of initiative membership).

Results
Carbon footprint of initiative members and non-members

On average, initiative members have 17% lower average CF relative to non-members, with 7.8
versus 9.3 tCO2eq/cap. Results from an independent one-sided t-test suggest that initiative
members have significantly lower total CF (t=2.34, P=0.010). Across quartiles, initiative members
have 7% (Q1), 11% (median) and 20% (Q3) lower total CF (Fig 1).

percentile (right hinge). Whiskers describe the minimum and maximum values in the absence of outliers (±1.5 x Interquartile range).
Outside values are excluded. P values (on the left) indicate the significance of mean (one-sided two-sample t-test) and median
(equality of medians nonparametric test) CF differences between initiative members and non-members regions. See the SI4-5 for
more detailed data overview and statistical tests.

By consumption domain, initiative members have lower food and clothing CF across quartiles (Fig
1). The average food CF for members is 1.6 tCO2eq/cap, compared to 2.4 tCO2eq/cap for the nonmembers (t=5.50, P=0.000). For clothing, the average CF is 0.1 and 0.3 tCO2eq/cap for initiative
members and non-members, respectively (t=13.13, P=0.000). Similarly, the results indicate that
the medians of the two samples are statistically different. We do not find a similar pattern for
housing and transport. The members’ average CF is 1.8 and 5.0 tCO2eq/cap for housing and
transport, respectively (compared to 2.2 and 4.6 tCO2eq/cap for non-members). Although the t-test
points to significant differences in housing CF between the samples, the result is likely influenced
by inter-group differences in socio-demographics, such as income and urbanization as discussed
below.

Isolating the membership effect from socio-demographic factors

We perform multiple regression analyses to compare the CF of initiative members with their sociodemographic regional counterparts (Table 2). The estimated models include the natural log
transformed values of total and domain-specific CF as dependent variables. The independent
variables are initiative membership (INITIATIVE), income (INCOME), and additional sociodemographic factors, which are controlled for in order to measure differences across comparable
individuals. Country-specific fixed effects were included to control for the potential cultural and
contextual factors shared by co-nationals. Thus, the INITIATIVE coefficient is interpreted as the
percentage change in the domain-specific footprint associated with initiative membership, holding
everything else constant. A negative and significant coefficient would be favorable from a climate
change mitigation perspective, as it suggests an actual CF reduction. We report 95% Confidence
Intervals (CI) in parenthesis. Our model and the choice of additional socio-demographic controls
has been motivated by prior literature, particularly income level, education, gender, family status,
age, urban typology and household size2,29,50,67. A detailed description of the effects and their
expected direction can be found in the model background (SI5).

Initiatives

Unstandardized beta coefficients and robust standard errors in parenthesis. Dependent variables in logarithmic form, by consumption domain.
Country-specific fixed effects and constant included. Significance level: *p<0.1, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01. See SI for further detail on independent
variables and correlation tests and for regression output for the non-member sample. The total sample includes initiative members and nonmembers.

We find an INITIATIVE coefficient of -0.16 (-0.29, -0.02), pointing to a significant (at the 5%
level) difference between initiative members and non-members in terms of total CF (Table 2). The
effect is stronger for food and clothing, -0.43 (-0.52, -0.33) and -0.86 (-1.11, -0.60), indicating that
members have about 43% and 86% lower food and clothing CF, respectively. The INITIATIVE
coefficient is insignificant at the 5% significance level for housing and transport, reflecting
similarities between initiative members and non-members in these domains. Our model explains
between 7-29% of the variance (Adj. R2) in the CF across consumption domains for the total sample
(Table 2).
Figure 2 confirms inter-group emission differences on a sub-domain level. Although initiative
members exhibit a 23% higher CF in vegetables and fruits, this increase is outweighed by a 32%
lower CF of meat, 31% lower CF of dairy products, and 33% lower CF of miscellaneous foods (Fig
2). The lower CF of initiative members reflects the combined effect of lower expenditure in food
and clothing, and lower carbon intensity of consumption due to dietary differences (less frequent
consumption of meat, dairy products and processed food) and a higher share of second-hand
clothing (SI5).
Our findings for housing and transport are consistent on a sub-domain level, with insignificant
INITIATIVE coefficients for CF associated with consumption of electricity, space and water
heating, land and air travel (Fig 2). We find no differences between initiative members and their
socio-demographic counterparts in terms of dwelling characteristics, living surface, electricity
consumption, heating demand and systems, commuting distance, car ownership, and number of
long-and short-flights.
Domain-specific differences between initiative members and non-members may be explained by
the constraints associated with specific low-carbon behaviors30,68. While decisions around diets and
clothing may better reflect individual preferences, mobility and housing choices are often

constrained by long-lived infrastructure, urban design, public transport options, and commuting
distances4,68. This trend has been identified as a behavioral paradox: “the greater the CO2 reduction
potential of mitigation actions, the less households are willing to implement them…because
they imply a greater lifestyle change.”68 (p. 150). It is worth noting that we find significant
behavioral differences even within the more structurally-constrained domains of housing and
mobility behaviors30, with initiative members tolerating lower home temperatures in the winter
(β=-0.9, p<.01, unit: preferred room temperature in °C) and commuting more by cycling and
walking (β=1786, p=.013, unit: annual km) (SI5).
The difference that we find between initiative members and non-members in terms of carbon
footprint appears conservative compared to prior studies. For example, Daly (2017) found that the
average reduction in carbon contribution of intentional communities was about 35%53. Howell
(2012) reported a similar reduction for members of a voluntary carbon allowance initiative54. These
studies surveyed initiatives with the explicit goal to reduce overall environmental impact, while
our sample covers a wider range of initiatives and goals. Noteworthy, these studies did not control
for socio-economic variables. Further, the studies did not employ a consistent carbon footprint
calculator across participants.
Our findings of 16% reduction (regression coefficient, Table 2) in GHG emissions driven by
changes in diet and fashion consumption of initiative members align with the reduction potential
from lifestyle changes at the macro-level35. Shifting to vegetarian diets is associated to a 6% CF
reduction, while adopting a full plant-based diet could reduce European household emissions by
14-16%35. Preferring locally produced fashion could yield 0.5% reduction, while re-using and
extending clothing lifetime could yield about 2% emission reduction35. Naturally, a bulk of
reduction potential remains within the housing and transport domains2,35, as discussed in the
limitations and policy sections.

Figure 2: Sub-domain INITIATIVE regression coefficients (dots) incl. 95% CI (whiskers). Carbon footprint (CF) by
consumption domains and sub-domains. See the method section for regression equation and SI5 for full output. Key: When zero is
included in the CI, one cannot conclude significant differences in the CF of initiative members for that sub-domain. Other food

includes processed food, beverages, fish products, and dry legumes. Color coding highlights the different consumption domains –
food, clothing, housing and transport.

We confirm income as a significant driver of CF for the total sample2,4,69. The shift to a higher
income class is associated with a 23% and 25% increase in the CF of typically income-elastic
domains such as clothing and mobility20(Table 2). The same shift is associated with a 5% increase
in the CF of food and housing, reflecting the low income elasticity of domains that serve basic
needs20.
Yet changes in income class (INCOME) do not explain variation in the CF for initiative members
in any of the consumption domains. The INCOME effect is no longer significant for initiative
members (except the partially significant coefficient for transport). In terms of consumption and
behavior, for initiatives, higher income does not imply higher expenditure on food, clothing and
electricity, car ownership or increased travel. Instead, we find other socio-demographic variables
such as household size67,69, gender67, and age67,69, and country-specific fixed effects2,69 to have a
higher explanatory power for the members’ CF variation across consumption domains (Table 2).
SI figure 2 provides more detail into the income distribution of the initiative member and nonmember samples, which appears approximately normally distributed.

Life satisfaction of initiative members and non-members

Finally, we screened for differences in life satisfaction58 between samples to test whether reduced
CF jeopardizes well-being9,16.We confirmed that the lower CF for initiative members is not
associated with lower life satisfaction; on the contrary, members scored even higher across most
items of the life satisfaction scale. We conducted ordinal logistic regressions and displayed
marginal effects with regards to the INITIATIVE coefficient (Fig 3).
We find highly significant inter-group life satisfaction (LS) differences for three of the five items
(LS1-3), and partially significant for LS5. Initiative members are 7-9% less likely to evaluate their
life negatively by disagreeing with life satisfaction statements (Fig 3, aggregating effects in red
and orange for LS1-3). Members are also 11-13% more likely to evaluate their life positively (Fig
3, aggregating effects in blue for LS1-3).
A recent qualitative study derived from the same project (GLAMURS) presented evidence of a
positive association between grassroots membership and several dimensions of well-being: selfacceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive
relations with others46. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that lower consumption CF and
higher life satisfaction are compatible for members of grassroots initiatives. Although lifesatisfaction is a broad indicator, it has been positively correlated with all of the aforementioned
dimensions of well-being14,60.
Previous studies reported negative associations between higher CF and life-satisfaction40,51,52, and
positive associations between initiative membership and life-satisfaction40,47,48. They explain this
trend through several mechanisms. First, the positive effects of being intrinsically motivated and
making conscious lifestyle choices47,70. Second, from an evolutionary perspective, small-scale,
tribal communities are associated with higher “mental health” and satisfied social needs55. Third,
social and economic capital are to some extent interchangeable71, thus the richer social capital
observed in these groups have been proposed to obviate the need for built capital or
consumption14,48. Finally, materialistic (extrinsically motivated) individuals have been associated

with lower life satisfaction, fewer environmentally friendly behaviors, and higher CF40,51. On the
contrary, altruistic behaviors, including volunteering, are positively associated with proenvironmental behaviors, higher well-being and lower CF47,50,52.

(whiskers). Based on ordinary logistic regression across the five LS items. Each LS item (dependent variable) is measured on a 7point scale from “Totally disagree” (in red, indicating low life satisfaction) to “Totally agree” (in blue, indicating high life
satisfaction). Key: When zero is included in the CI, one cannot conclude significant differences in the LS of initiative members.
Odds ratios included in SI5.

Limitations and future work
There are some limitations with regards to the type of initiatives sampled. Our sample includes
comprehensive grassroots initiatives such as the Transition Town movement and eco-villages, but
lacks initiatives specialized in housing and mobility e.g., co-housing, downsizing, car sharing,
cycling17. Thus, our results are not conclusive in these domains and further investigation of such
initiative niches is needed. Particularly, the domain of transport stands out with its high importance
for consumption-based emissions, and hence further exploration is key30. Similarly, no sampled
initiatives target electronic appliances and devices. Initiatives such as Repair Cafés, where people
develop repairing skills and swap appliances, may yield reductions in the CF of manufactured
products. Manufactured products and services have been discussed as income elastic; that is, we
expect stronger emission increases in these domains as income increases, compared to basic goods
such as food and energy2,20,72. Further exploration of the INCOME effect for initiative member with
regards to highly elastic goods is needed to conclude on the income-footprint relationships and its
implications in other consumption domains. Our assessment is focused on carbon –however other
resource savings might be associated with initiative membership. Members consume significantly
less food and clothing, which are particularly water and land intensive20. Thus, consumer-side shifts
in these domains will be relevant even under a low-carbon energy scenario. Even though initiatives
membership is associated with lower climate impacts, the observed reductions are insufficient to

bring European consumption within planetary boundaries12. The average CF of initiative members
is still about five times higher than the per capita quota of 1.6 tCO2eq12 and further efforts are
required to reach the target.
Nevertheless, initiative members show 16% lower carbon footprints compared to non-members,
and demonstrate substantially different consumption patterns such as higher adoption of
vegetarianism, cooler housing, and lower reliance on car travel and other consumption (SI5). While
these point to potential constraints of low-carbon activities, they may also point to opportunities.
Investigating low-carbon adaptations such as better insulated housing and working from home lie
beyond this study, although there may be substantial differences in their adoption rates between
members and non-members.
We use LS scale as an indicator for well-being, which has been widely used and thus enables
comparison with previous literature12,14,60,61,73,74. While the LS has proven cross-cultural
validity61,75, the challenge remains to empirically determine the relative weight of universal and
personal factors that influence LS61,74. Given the strong influence of basic material needs, the
adequacy of LS to represent well-being has been questioned as it is not a guarantee of mental nor
emotional health76. Beyond living standards, recent studies find that fundamental human needs
such as freedom, relatedness and mastery explain differences in LS between individuals of similar
material well-being60,61,74.
Both research on well-being and environmental protection are turning to assessing fundamental
human needs directly rather than aggregated measures of well-being14,60,77. Grassroots initiatives
have been described as synergistic need satisfiers due to the wide range of needs they might
simultaneously address: social connection, creativity, learning, self-acceptance, productive leisure
and, in some cases, basic needs such as quality food and housing37. Future research could explore
specific needs in relation to membership14 and to different lifestyle changes35.
Because LS can be affected by peoples’ escalating desires and standards61, a focus on fundamental
needs is more compatible with mitigation and adaptation strategies77. A needs-centered view on
sustainable developments calls for rationing resources only where they prove to satisfy needs14,77.
In this sense, grassroots initiatives might be a resource-efficient strategy to satisfy fundamental
needs14 .

Uncertainty and validation

We explored footprint distributions and regression results, particularly INITIATIVE and INCOME
coefficients, across the four regions and confirmed that the patterns discussed in the main text
generally hold across regions (see SI5). More detailed graphs depicting how the different regions
compare in terms of the practical and statistical significance of the INITIATIVE coefficients in the
food, clothing, housing and transport domains can be found in SI5. While some differences are
noted across regions, the INITIATIVE coefficients are of high practical and statistical significance
for all sampled regions. Further, the observed trend of the INITIATIVE effect on CF holds true for
consumption and behavioral variables (see SI5).
In addition, we test robustness of our main statistical results (see SI5). Seven of the 12 sampled
initiatives are particularly focused on the production, distribution or consumption of food (see
Methods). We ran the regression model separately for food-specific and other initiatives and
observe similar trends of the INITIATIVE effect across domains and overlapping 95% confidence
intervals. This suggests evidence for a “positive spillover”, or consistency in the lifestyles of

members, regardless of the main focus of the initaitve23. This validation step also supports the
observation that clothing and food might be domains where lifestyle decisions are more directly
reflected, whereas housing and mobility are rather constrained by context 30,68.
We conducted several uncertainty checks to test the assumptions behind our footprint calculations,
e.g. flight distance (SI 3.6). Our survey-based CF values for individuals are within the range
reported by prior CF per capita assessments of regional household consumption2. Domain-level
footprint calculations were validated against domain-specific CF of EU regions (see SI3).
We further compared our results obtained through multivariate regression with propensity score
matching analysis, which by reducing the covariates into a single score, reduces confounding bias
and adds certainty to our results. The coefficients from the propensity score matching analysis were
comparable to our regression estimates, with all OLS regression coefficients contained in the
estimates 95% confidence intervals.

Policy Implications
Despite the overall behavioral changes, the CF reduction of members was moderate and confined
to the domains of food and clothing. Efforts from the supply side could help reduce the carbon
intensity of consumption35. Partnerships between policymakers and initiatives could tackle
constraints imposed by structural factors, especially in the domains of housing and transport, in
order to maximize citizens’ opportunities to reduce emissions30,33.
Indeed, the Paris Pledge for Action 2 saw unprecedented willingness to act by non-state
stakeholders, including grassroots initiatives and citizen networks, with more than 1,000 non-state
initiatives signing their commitment to keep the world well below a 2°C trajectory. Although the
potential of non-state actions is clearly acknowledged in the official Paris decisions, the
mechanisms to support, upscale and embed them into national pledges remain vague17,18,36.
Diffusion is the process by which a new technology, idea or behavior is spread among the members
of a social system, across different geographies or throughout time24,78. Large scale diffusion of
grassroots initiatives may lead to social tipping points by offering opportunities for low-impact
behaviors and higher social well-being to a wider audience23,24. Diffusion can be supported bottomup, as more members engage, or by embedding the initiatives’ agendas into institutional
strategies35,39. Replication or “out-scaling” is another mechanism of diffusion, which happens
when similar initiatives emerge in other geographies78,79. Finally, translation is the diffusion
process through which grassroots innovations are translated to other consumption domains79,80.
While initiatives might benefit from collaborations with official institutions in terms of resources
and visibility81, it might also crowd-out members82 or weaken key aspects such as governance,
accountability, inclusion and autonomy17,37,39,81. Not all initiatives are equal candidates for
upscaling81. Some grassroots initiatives might aim to remain low-scale and local, and thus diffusion
might not be a de-facto goal83. Rather than focusing solely on upscaling existing initiatives, policies
should consider incubating and supporting emerging initiatives to outlive their typical financial
challenges by providing visible physical space, facilitate training and provide financial operating

resources17,37,39, as well as support trans-initiative networking efforts84.In sum, a sensible strategy
to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement would not solely rely on technological change, but also
on ambitious multi-scale policy reforms combined with non-state actions and lifestyle changes that
reduce impact and enhance well-being21,35,36.
Our results suggests a role for grassroots initiatives in supporting “sustainable de-growth” in
Europe11. Policies that seek to optimize climate and social goals are not to underestimate the role
of grassroots initiatives in creating opportunities for low-carbon well-being. Beyond the statistical
differences between members and non-members, initiatives foster new practices that are freely ran
by citizens and made available to the wider public. In this sense, sustainably initiatives may have
the social function of promoting and enabling sustainable lifestyles, thus paving the way for wider
acceptance of CF reduction policies17.

Concluding remarks
We find members of grassroots initiatives not only to exhibit lower carbon footprints and higher
life satisfaction, but also to dissociate consumption emissions from income and well-being. For
members, lower consumption is compatible with higher well-being, supporting the notion of
voluntary simplicity16,37,40. Previous research suggests that voluntary simplicity is positively
associated with mindfulness40 and that participating in grassroots initiatives spurs self-awareness
of underlying values and behavior73. Further, engaging in grassroots initiatives might expose
participants to a combination of stimuli such as information, setting goals, public commitments,
social norms and behavioral feedbacks, all of which can potentially influence behavior, by creating
new habits or reinforcing existing ones23,27,29,37,39,49,50. In this sense, social learning and group
interaction are not only mechanisms through which knowledge and skills are shared, but they also
stimulate the questioning of the current narratives of consumption and well-being, including
institutional logics, power relations and the goals of the current systems and lifestyles17,37,43,45,70.
As social innovations, grassroots initiatives might be more efficient than government or markets at
satisfying certain social needs: by offering affordable products such as organic food or renewable
energy, creating innovative governance arrangements, establishing alternative economic circuits79
or proto-institutions that embed new sustainable lifestyles44. Quantifying multi-level, multicriteria, and long-term environmental and social effects of initiatives remains an interesting
challenge for future research in this area.
In summary, we find grassroots initiatives membership to shed insights towards the goal of
sustainable consumption and production (SDG12) by decoupling footprints from income (SDG8)
and reconciling environmental conservation (SDG13-15) with enhanced well-being. We consider
grassroots initiatives to be worthy of further research and policy consideration as a strategy for the
transformation towards sustainability.
