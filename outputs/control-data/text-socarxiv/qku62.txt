Abstract
The perception of the English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(KSA) is extremely crucial since their perceived views regarding the commercial English learning
textbooks plays a major role in framing their attitudes towards such textbooks. These textbooks
are published by different international publishers and used extensively in EFL programs around
the globe. Moreover, attitudes do influence language learning. This paper aims to investigate
teachers’ attitudes toward the commercial textbooks used in (EFL) programs. In this quantitative
research, forty-three EFL instructors were surveyed through a Likert scale questionnaire. The
results reveal, in general, the negative attitudes of the teacher towards commercial English
textbooks since for them such textbooks are found insufficient in meeting the courses’ aims and
objectives, students language proficiency level, their cultural sensitiveness, and their academic
backgrounds. The study found teachers opinion vis-à-vis textbooks inappropriate content, a
mismatch in learners’ needs and not in agreement with teaching methodologies. The paper offers
a few recommendations to the EFL instructors as well as to the instructional designers to adapt
and customize commercial textbooks in line with learners’ needs. It suggests teachers to use
teaching material to suit the purpose, in addition to advising curriculum designers and content
developers to take into account the specific needs of the students and the objectives of the course.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

Introduction
The use of commercial textbooks that are introduced by international publishers is a
common practice in most of the EFL programs due to the lack of language learning materials.
Textbooks are considered the primary resource of input that students receive during their schooling
years. Language teachers build their lessons, activities, and assignments based on the textbooks
they use in their classrooms. Instructional materials can be divided broadly into two types: Printed
content (textbooks, workbook, course book, and alternative material, etc.) and Non- Printed
content (audios, videos, and computer-based materials). These are considered as the backbone of
any EFL program. Of all these study materials, ‘textbooks’ are considered the most important
component of any teaching/learning process.
Teachers’ positive attitudes towards the textbooks are surety of effective attainment of
actual teaching and learning objectives whereas; reservations can destroy the whole process.
Attitudes are also significant to measure because they act as directives for curriculum designer and
material developers for the creation and development of new teaching materials. Also, it calculates
the textbooks’ strengths and weaknesses in different aspects such as the culture of the target
language, instructions given in the textbooks, input, and output.
Richards (2001) believes that EFL textbooks are a key component in most EFL language
programs. They are especially beneficial for both teachers and learners. For teachers, they provide
a kind of framework in achieving the aims and objectives of the course and guide them in
conducting lessons. For learners, the textbook is the main exposure to the target language apart
from the inputs they received from their language instructor. The use of commercial textbooks
which are introduced by any international publishers is a common practice in most of the EFL
programs. Since the textbooks play an essential role in any teaching-learning processes, and
teachers are primary stakeholders of such books, so it is important to measure their attitudes
towards such textbooks. The evaluation of the teachers’ attitudes towards commercial textbooks
is significant because it affects the whole teaching-learning practice.
The students, as well as instructors, both are benefitted from the evaluation process of the
textbooks. It is critical and beneficial for teachers’ development and professional growth. Ellis
(1997) opines that it helps the teachers to gain purposeful, accurate, systematic and contextual
insights into the overall nature of the textbook material. It mentions the students’ needs and helps
the teachers to gain high-quality materials. Students are the actual end users of these commercial
textbooks. Thus any language program must measure the attitudes of the target group. Regarding
textbooks, for which these are, designed (Baker, 1992). Learners’ negative attitudes towards
textbooks may decrease their motivation and may act as a major obstacle in their attainment of L2
proficiency.
According to Tomlinson (2003), “materials evaluation is a procedure that involves
measuring the value of a set of learning materials. It involves making judgments about the effect
of the materials on the people using them” (p. 15). Teachers are not passive recipients of any
textbooks’ contents. They accept the inputs once they have evaluated them and accept their
effectiveness regarding compatibility with their classroom. For them textbooks’ should be
practical and feasible in terms of time, resources available, teachers’ and students’ needs,

methodology, aims and objectives of the course. Teachers’ negative attitude towards textbooks
might help them to explore every bit of the textbook and will urge them to incorporate it into most
of their lesson plans. And ultimately, this helps the language school to harvest positive course
outcomes.
Teachers’ incompatible attitudes towards commercial textbooks will result in their
reservations whereas their wholehearted cooperation and support will result in an intended
outcome. Teachers’ attitudes towards textbooks might be shaped by different factors like their
educational background, their age, educational level, and their teaching experiences.
Thus, this present study is an attempt to explore the teachers’ general attitudes towards
commercial textbooks used in KSA in EFL undergraduate program. In doing so, the study will
investigate whether the textbooks are suitable as per the official curriculum, needs, and interests
of the students, the methodology of the teachers, aims and objectives of the course from the
teachers perspective. Their notion will help the instructional designers in producing the appropriate
materials, and these notions will help the teachers’ themselves in adapting and customizing the
existing textbooks as per their needs. Hence, measuring teachers’ attitudes towards commercial
textbooks in EFL programs would be very beneficial for educators, trainers, institutions, and above
all for publishers. But, one undeniable fact should always be kept in mind that “no commercial
textbook will ever be a perfect fit for language programs” (Richards 2001, p.2). This defines
commercial textbooks as textbooks that are designed by international publishers to be taught in
different EFL contexts albeit they are designed or adapted for a particular context. They can be
used to teach students from different countries, university majors, and mother tongues.
Furthermore, the paper focuses on the users who will use the textbooks. Teachers are
essential stakeholders to understand their attitudes about the textbooks. Teachers’ negative attitude
towards the textbooks might result in the less effective use of the textbooks in language classrooms.
This might affect the course’ outcomes negatively since most of the language schools choose those
textbooks that match their curriculum outcomes. On the other hand, the positive attitude toward
textbooks might help the teachers to use textbooks in most of their lesson plans. This helps the
language schools to achieve the course outcomes. Different factors might shape the teachers'
attitudes toward textbooks: it might be based on their educational background, their age, their
educational level, and their teaching experiences.
Literature Review
Language textbooks are an essential part of the learning process in language classrooms
(Garinger, 2001; Richards, 2001; Tomlinson, 1998, 2003). They are the base of the learning
outcomes. Language teachers use the textbooks in the classroom for several reasons. One obvious
reason is lacking the ability to develop new learning materials for classroom instruction
(Sheldon, 1988). Language teachers find it challenging to create and develop their language
teaching materials. They might do not have enough time in their classrooms to use new materials
besides the textbooks. Newly created materials by the teachers might cause unexpected results in
the classrooms due to their lack of experience in materials creations and adaptations. Therefore,
the EFL teachers use the published commercial language textbooks because they are signed by the
schools’ administration to fill in the course outcomes.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

Cunningsworth (1995) identifies several roles of language textbooks in the learning and
teaching process. Textbooks can be the resources for the activities and practices in the classroom.
They are the reference for the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. Teachers can create and
develop ideas in the language classrooms based on the use of the textbooks. They help the new
teachers or the less experienced teachers to run their classrooms. Also, students can learn by
themselves using their textbooks inside or outside their classrooms. Moreover, schools might
choose textbooks that reflect the goals and objectives of the course. The textbooks reflect the
objectives of the course and methods of teaching in the classroom. They work as the mirror for the
activities that take place in the classroom. By reading the textbooks, the reader can have a clear
idea about the course outcomes and contents (Richard 1998).
The advantages of using language textbooks in the language classrooms vary based on the
textbooks and the contexts where they are used. Richards (2001) and Graves (2000) argue that one
of the advantages of the textbooks is providing enough visuals and different activities that save the
teachers’ time to search for language teaching materials. Textbooks which are visually appealing
and contain different activities might attract the students’ attention and engage them in the learning
process. Experts in language learning fields write the textbooks, which give the textbooks
outcomes that are more purposeful. Writing textbooks is a long process in which they are exposed
to the students and tested several times before they are actually published to make sure that they
yield the expected learning outcomes in favorable learning conditions. Moreover, they help the
teachers to set clear goals and objectives for their courses. In short, textbooks are the resource of
knowledge in the classrooms and outside the classrooms.
The disadvantages of using textbooks in language classroom might be caused by the
textbooks themselves or by the contexts where they are being used. Crawford (2002), Graves
(2000), and Richards (2001) opine that the textbooks might have negative effects on the learning
process. For example, the textbooks might not match the students’ language proficiency levels and
cultural values. Students might depend on the textbooks as the only source of information. This
will limit the students’ ability to explore further in the target language. Besides, this will deskill
the teachers and limit their creativities in the classroom. Another negative side of the textbooks is
that some of these are designed for specific contexts which might cause conflicts in the classroom
such as cultural, political and social conflicts.
Teachers’ beliefs influence the instructional practices in the classroom (Burns, 1992; Lee
& Bathmaker, 2007). Their attitudes are a key factor in the effectiveness of using the textbooks in
the classroom. Their attitudes shape the way they interpret and teach the textbooks. In EFL
programs, this is an important variable that does influence the effectiveness of using the textbooks
in language learning. McGrath (2006) stresses that “since teachers’ attitudes to textbooks are likely
to have an impact on how they use them, and learners’ attitudes, and learning, will be affected by
how teachers use them, it seems vital to seek to understand what these attitudes are” (p.171).
Understanding teachers’ attitudes toward textbooks will explain the way the teachers’ deal with
them. Negative attitudes might result in less or ineffective use of the textbooks. Positive attitudes
might exploit every part of the textbooks in the classrooms.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

However, few studies focus on the EFL teachers’ attitudes toward the EFL textbooks.
Harwood (2010) states, “clearly, future studies also need to focus on students’ reactions to and
comprehension of the materials, as well as on teachers’ interpretations of the materials” (p.19).
There is the need to conduct further studies on the effect of teachers’ attitudes on the use of
textbooks (Harwood, 2010) since that the textbooks are the most convenient form of presenting
materials in the classrooms (Littlejohn, 1992; Tomlinson, 2001).
The Research Question:
a. Based on EFL teachers’ experiences in the field, how they perceive EFL commercial
textbooks in EFL program and what they think about the influence of EFL commercial
textbooks on students, courses, contents, and cultures in EFL learning environment are
the gist of this research. How do the teachers, in general, perceive EFL textbooks?
b. What are the negative contents that could affect the learning outcome?
c. How far, as per the teacher\s perceptions, the textbooks mismatch with the course
objective?
d. How does the content affect the learners in the lingual and cultural domain?
Methods
The current study is having a naturistic and exploratory approach as it considers the
experience, perception and social realities of EFL teachers towards textbooks.
A questionnaire was administered to seek the opinion of teachers. It contains fourteen
closed-ended responses that investigate the teachers’ attitudes toward the use of textbooks in their
classrooms. Brown (2001) writes, “Attitudes questions are typically used to obtain data about the
participants’ feelings, wishes, and attitudes toward the elements of a language curriculum” (p. 33).
These attitudes’ questions are evaluated on Likert-scale questions. Likert-scale questions are used
in the survey because they are “effective for gathering respondents’ views, opinions, and attitudes
about various language-related issues” (Brown, 2001, P. 41). The survey items are adapted from
language materials evaluation research (Littlejohn, 1998., Tomlinson, 1998; 2003). They are
ordered rationally to control the ordering effect. They are formatted in terms of spacing, typing
and highlighting to give the participants a clear idea about the survey. (see Appendix A for the
Questionnaire items).
Participants
It is essential to describe the participants in the study and the reasons for their selection
(Brown, 1988). In this study, the participants are the English language instructors at a Saudi
university. They have different biographical factors. They have different cultural backgrounds as
they are from different countries such as South Africa, Canada, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, Jordan, Bangladesh, Sudan, Yemen, and Syria. They have different educational and
curriculum backgrounds as they have finished their graduate and postgraduate studies in different
countries such as America, Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, India, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
Sudan, Syria, and United Kingdom and that too at different educational institutions in those
countries. They are also of varied age groups.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

The participant teachers have vast, multifarious, and diverse experience of teaching EFL
in various institutions and in many countries. There, they have worked at different positions, have
taught various English learning (crash, short-term and full-term) courses to different levels of
students. Moreover, the most important factor is that they have dealt with mixed and wide-ranging
commercial textbooks in achieving the desired outcomes.
The students are mostly Saudi sharing the same culture and same first language (Arabic).
They are roughly between 19-25 years of age. They are all male. The requirements to attend the
college at the Saudi Universities are passing the high school and the Saudi National Exam
(QEYAS). The university students are not required to do any English proficiency test that shows
their English proficiency level such as TOEFL or ILETS.
Results and Discussions
The survey items are grouped into four categories: Students’ Related Issues, Content
Related Issues, Course Related Issues, and Culture Related Issues. The items are presented in the
survey in different to examine the participants’ attitudinal factors about each category. Future
pedagogical implications and recommendations are then made on the basis of analysis of the result
collected.
A. EFL Commercial Textbooks & EFL Students
The first category presents the teachers’ perspectives on issues related to students in
commercial textbooks. Table 1 summarizes and presents the participants’ attitudes about the

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

The first item in this category asked the instructors about their opinions if the textbooks
help the students in their future study at the University. More than half of the surveyed instructors
thought that the commercial textbooks help the students in their future academic studies at the
university. The majority believe that commercial textbooks provide the students with the academic
language that the students need in their colleges. The textbooks might contain enough academic
words and structures of the academic language. The textbooks give synchronized structure and a
standard syllabus for a course. Without textbooks, a course has no spine and students have no
systemically planned and developed syllabus. However, there are quite a few instructors who think
that the commercial textbooks are not necessarily helpful for the students’ academic studies in
their colleges. This might be due to commercial textbooks are not able to maintain the quality,
students are not exposed to the materials, the content of the textbooks are not tried and tested, they
may lack sound learning principle.
The second item in the category asked the instructors’ about their views if the textbooks’
contents consider the students’ academic backgrounds. More than half of the surveyed instructors
believe that the textbooks do not consider the students’ academic backgrounds.
They may believe that commercial textbooks have distorted content, inauthentic language
and may not reflect the students’ need properly. Students take different courses in their elementary
and in high schools. Thus, they have different academic backgrounds. For example, in Saudi
Arabia, there are core courses such as the Holy Quran, Hadith, Tawheed, Fiqah, and Arabic
language since the elementary education that are not available in other countries. Also, students
might join different academic disciplines. This will create different academic needs. Barnard and
Zemach illustrate, “a student taking a humanities seminar will need discussion skills; a student in
the science may need specialized vocabulary” (2003, p. 312).
The third item in the category asked the instructors if they think that the commercial the
textbooks fit the students’ language proficiency level. The majority of the instructors think that the
textbooks do not meet the students’ English language proficiency. These textbooks might be higher
or lower than the students’ current language level. Instructors might be of this opinion that
textbooks are mostly targeted towards marketing or profit-making so the publishers may
compromise the language proficiency contents and major instructional principles. International
publishers target schools that follow the western or English speaking countries educational
systems. The educational systems are varied among the countries. For example, the English
language is taught since the kindergarten in some countries. In Saudi Arabia, students begin their
English classes from the sixth grade.
In addition, the English language textbooks in high schools also vary. Tomlinson states
“materials should help the learners to develop confidence, “e.g., through pushing learners slightly
beyond their existing proficiency by involving them in tasks which are challenging but achievable”
(2003, p. 21). Also, textbooks’ activities should build the learners’ confidence so that learners can
use language well. Rubdy (2003) stresses that the activities in materials should provide learners
with confidence. So, the students can communicate well in their classrooms with their classmates
and instructors.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

The last item in this category asked the instructors if the commercial textbooks provide the
students with the language proficiency needed to get success in their studies. The majority of the
instructors believe that the textbooks provide the students with the language proficiency that they
need to get success in their studies which is based on the authentic materials, target group and need
for language learning, what is happening in the world, intrinsic educational thirst and the same
piece of material can be used under different way and situation.
Textbooks might contain the necessary vocabulary and language structures that students
need to understand before they start their studies in their colleges. Few instructors thought that the
textbooks do not necessarily provide the needed language proficiency to achieve success in
colleges. This might be due to the fact that the textbooks cannot cover all the vocabulary and
language skills in different disciplines.
Howard and Brown, (1997) stress that in order to provide adequate preparation for college/
university-level work, English for academic purposes instructors must be able to teach the
following language skills and strategies: (a) reading (e.g., scanning, skimming, and critical
thinking). (b) Writing (e.g., academic discourse, genres, grammar). (c) Listening/speaking (e.g.,
lectures oral presentation). Also, Millard (2000) stresses that language programs should include
some form of grammatical instructions to develop students’ grammatical accuracy.
B. Commercial Textbooks and EFL Contents
The second category presents participants’ perspectives regarding the contents of the
commercial textbooks. Table 2 summarizes and presents the participants’ attitudes regarding the
contents that commercial textbooks include.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

The first item in the category asked the participants based on their experiences if they
realize that the teachers do not need to reorder some of the textbooks’ content. The instructors’
opinions are spread between the agreement and disagreement. It seems that the majority of them
think that they need to order the textbooks. There might be different reasons to do so such as course
books deskill teachers, course books cause boredom, no textbook is perfect, every class is unique,
and every student should be treated individually. Another obvious reason is to coordinate with
other language skill classes that might use different textbooks. Materials should be adaptable to
make the learning process effective. Dat Boa states, “good material should suggest ways for the
teacher to make the process adaptable to a broad spectrum of learners” (2003, p.386).
Moreover, the textbooks should be flexible to sequence them the way teachers need.
Millard (2000) stresses that “[grammar textbooks should] maintain a communicative focus that
interests learners while allowing teachers to sequence their classes as they deem appropriate” (p.
49). In addition, the textbooks should be adaptable for teaching styles, students’ needs, and
institution’s goals. Singapore and Duriya state that the materials should be adaptable to teaching
styles and the methods of the teaching body (2003, p. 144).
The second item in the category asked the teachers if they think that the teachers do not
need to add some content to the textbooks. Around 40% of the instructors think that they need to
add some contents to the textbooks to cover the course aims and objectives. 37% percent give
equal opportunity to the additional materials use in the classroom. They expect that they sometimes
might need to bring materials from outside the textbooks to help the students to achieve the
course’s outcomes. Graves (2000) suggested that teacher should use the textbooks as a resource to
minimize the difficulties and may use as a guide, be free to modify, change, eliminate, evaluate,
add, develop and supplement the textbooks with lots of external readings. Another reason might
be that the textbooks do not meet all the students’ needs and learning styles. The textbook should
contain different learning styles to give an equal opportunity to the students because there are
usually different students who have different learning styles such as auditory learning (learning by
hearing), visual learning (learning by seeing), and kinesthetic learning (learning by doing) in the
class. Tomlinson (2003) states that the materials should cater for different preferred learning styles.
Moreover, Hismanoglu (2000) stresses that the most important role for foreign language
teacher is the provision of a collection of tasks to match varied learning styles. In order to do this
role, the teacher needs materials that consider learners’ different learning styles. Around 23% of
the instructors doubt that whether they need to add some contents to the textbooks since the
textbooks cover all the course’ objectives. After all, the teachers do not have enough time to cover
the signed language materials by the administrations.
The third item asked the participants if they think that the teachers do not need to replace
some of the textbooks’ content. More than one-third of the instructors find that in some situations
they need to replace the content of the textbooks. For example, if the textbooks contain
inappropriate activities that might not match the students’ interests such as sports’ activities like
ice hockey and ice skating, rugby, and cricket. These sports are uncommon in Saudi Arabia.
Teachers might replace them with other common sports in Saudi Arabia such as soccer and
volleyball. The instructors might replace some of the contents of the textbook with more authentic

activities that fit the students’ needs. Graves (2000) gave a cycle in which a series of steps can be
practiced. Planning, how to teach with text, teaching the text, re-planning how to teach, and reteaching. Planning includes need analysis and textbook structure analysis; teaching takes care of
implementing the modifications. Re-planning stresses on planning again using all the conclusions
made during the completion of a course and reteaching is the implementation of the decisions and
conclusions made during re-planning.
The textbook should contain authentic materials. Outside the classroom, students are going
to listen and read the language that is not modified for non-native speakers. Saraceni (2003) states
that language learning materials should be based on authentic texts that are texts which have been
written for any purpose other than language teaching. So, language teachers should prepare their
students by teaching those authentic materials and use authentic activities that students are going
to do in the college. Lowe (2010) clarifies, “language teachers should dare to use authentic texts,
and must use authentic activities such as summarizing, outlining and inferencing” (p.1). It is the
teacher responsibility to use authentic materials, and they can do that by choosing a book that
contains authentic texts.
The fourth item in the category asked the participants think that the contents of the
commercial textbooks are updated. More than half of the instructors think that the textbooks are
up-to-date. The textbooks contain current topics such as technology products names and current
international events. The textbook should provide the students with the most important and current
technological terms and abbreviation. Outdated textbooks might not increase the students’
motivations and engagements especially of those who have joined the college of engineering and
computer sciences. Richards (2015) standpoint is to monitor the use of materials by classroom
observation, feedback sessions with teachers, written reviews by teacher or group of teachers, and
students’ comments on their experience of with the materials.
Motivation plays a vital role in the language learning process. So, students should be
motivated to learn effectively. Cives-Enriques states, “if the students of any discipline enjoy what
they are doing, they will at least make the effort to learn” (2003, p. 240). Therefore, materials’
activities should motivate students to learn. Harmer (2007) states that students become bored and
they find the subject more difficult than their expectations. Therefore, the teacher should sustain
students’ motivation by providing materials that contain current topics and issues.
C. EFL Commercial Textbooks and EFL Courses
The third category presented the participants’ views of factors that are related to courses
inside the commercial textbooks. Table 3 summarizes and presents the influence of EFL
commercial textbooks in EFL courses.

The first item in this category presents the participants’ views if they think that the
textbooks meet the course’s aims and objectives. 28% of the instructors think that commercial
textbooks fail to foster the course’ aims and objectives. They think that the course’ objectives are
broad and cannot fit within a single commercial textbook. The majority of them give equal
opportunities where the textbooks might meet some but not all. This might mean that the textbooks
to some extent meet the course’ overall objectives. 32% of the surveyed instructors agree that the
textbooks that they use meet the course’ aims and objectives.
Skopinskaja, (2003) states textbook content needs to be analyzed in reference to its
specified aims and objectives, e.g., to what extent teaching areas like grammar, vocabulary,
reading and writing and culture is present in a student’s book, teachers’ manual, and activity book.
Also, it is important to determine whether, for example, cultural information is taught in a
particular context (texts, exercises, dialogues) or as isolated facts.
The textbooks might achieve the aims by verifying the learners’ roles that textbooks
activities provide. For example, the role of the learners might be that of a participator in some
activities, researcher, context explorer, speaker, a builder who constructs products such as
diagrams or essays, a listener, a reader, a team member who works on projects, or of a writer who
applies and analyzes information.
The second item in this category asked the participants if they think that the commercial
textbooks organization fit the course’s time frame. From the mentioned results, we can see that
instructors are not satisfied with the time that is required to cover the textbook chapters. 32% of
the instructors have negative experiences about managing time to cover the required textbooks
within the semester. This issue shows that the EFL program administration might underestimate
or overestimate the required period to teach each textbook. EFL programs vary regarding the time
required to finish the assigned textbooks. Some school might want to finish the textbooks within
two months. Others might need to finish them in four months. This is a dilemma for the language
textbooks publishers. They cannot meet the needs of all EFL programs with one textbook.
Educationist advocates that there is an appropriate balance between depth and breadth in the
treatment of subject matter, the level of difficulty of the material for timely completion of a course
book.

EFL Teachers’ Attitudes toward Commercial Textbooks

Alhamami & Ahmad

In addition, it is clear that some of these commercial textbooks are designed to be selfstudy materials. However, teachers might facilitate difficulties, manage the activities, provide
information, or add examples. Coulson clarifies that the effectiveness of self-study materials will
increase “if the teacher actively augmented the instruction by rephrasing difficult program items,
adding examples, working through the program problems with the student, and branching the
student to different parts of the program” (1967, p. 1). So, the stockholders are varied with their
time slots to study these commercial textbooks. As a result, this puts demands on the EFL programs
to be careful about assigning the required time to cover the textbooks.
The third question in this category asked the instructors if they think that the commercial
textbooks are suitable with regard to the teaching methods used in the classes. 67 percent of the
instructors have found that the textbooks can fit with different teaching methods. It seems that the
commercial textbooks are fixable with different language teaching methods. Materials should
develop a student’s ability to communicate in spoken and written form. Tomlinson (2003)
confirms that “materials should provide the learners with opportunities to use the target language
to achieve communicative purposes” (p. 21).
Flipped classroom model can be useful as it encourages students to prepare the lesson
before the lecture. At present, gamification method is in fashion. It enables students to learn the
subject without even realizing. It is a technique which focuses on learning through the use of
games. Social media can also be used as a tool for teaching. Today students are well connected to
various social media websites and their applications so they need little motivation. For example,
the Brazilian Academy of Languages “Red Ballon” asked students to review the tweets of their
favorite artists and correct grammatical errors that they committed in an effort to improve their
English language skills!
In recent years, publishers have tried to create materials that promote students’ ability to
use the language. Littlejohn (1992) states that there is “an increased role for materials in
endeavoring to provide ways of promoting communicative language use” (p.108). Even some of
them are designed for more updated teaching methods such as the communicative teaching
methods. The teachers have the ability to use the same contents with different teaching methods
such as the grammar-translation method and audio-lingual method.
D. EFL Commercial Textbooks and EFL Cultures
The fourth category in this study presents the teachers’ attitudes toward cultural issues
inside the commercial textbooks. Table 4 summarizes and presents the variables that are related
to culture in EFL commercial textbooks.

The first question in this category asked the participants if they believe that the commercial
textbooks do not conflict with the students’ values, beliefs and culture. When the instructors were
asked about the cultural conflicts in EFL classrooms due to the use of the commercial textbooks,
more than half of them give the equal opportunity of agreement and disagreement. They are not
quite sure about the cultural issues that commercial textbooks raise in the classroom. This might
be due to the fact that the teachers come from different backgrounds and have different cultures
than the students’ culture. The instructors might not have a deep understanding of their students’
culture and religious beliefs. It depends on the context and people. Some students might be more
open-minded where they can accept discussions on cultural topics such as religious beliefs and
religious holidays.
The question to ask ourselves bearing in mind socio-cultural factors in language teaching
process is whether teachers should include socio-cultural factors in the teaching process.
Wardhaugh(1992) wrote instructors might have a positive or negative response. In case of positive
response, then we have to decide how much socio-cultural information should be given to learners
and what methods of teaching and kind of techniques should be used while analyzing or teaching
the textbooks. We may have different target culture; it does not primarily a native culture like
English or British. Instructors must consider the learners' needs, characteristics and aims.
Zaid (1999) stresses that in some EFL textbooks there are violations to some native
cultures. Although the authors may not have intended these insensitivities; all of these, from the
perspective of a non-Western culture, promote confrontation. For example, social aspects of
Western culture are stressed in exercises and activities: Boyfriend/girlfriend, dating, beach/bikini
wear, the consumption of wine, dancing, and hugging. These might be prohibited social activities
in certain non-Western societies such as Saudi Arabia.
According to Byram and Grundy (2003), language students can develop cultural sensitivity
if they are allowed to internalize different cultural outlooks and perspectives as well as the
fundamental aspects of cultures. There is a need that a culturally neutral form of English or target
culture tailored English textbooks should be appropriate to nullify the cultural sensitiveness.
Global language utilization for communication purposes would enable the non-native speakers to
retain their cultural characteristics as much as possible.
The second item in this category asked the participants if they think that the teachers do
not need to delete some of the commercial textbooks’ content. More than half of the instructors
need to delete some of these commercial textbooks contents. There might be different reasons for

Alhamami & Ahmad

doing so such as cultural conflicts. These textbooks might contain sensitive contents as we have
discussed in the second question. Teachers can also delete repeated contents as they might have
been covered in other textbooks. Teachers can also delete some contents because they are either
complicated and unnecessary for the students, or too easy for them.
The teacher or instructor is not obliged to cover all the content of the textbook. Sometimes,
some parts of the textbook are not appropriate for the teaching situation. The process of textbook
adaptation is left for language teachers. Some objectives for material adaptation: to eliminate the
unnecessary content, to consider individual differences, to provide the content based on learning
strategies and cognitive styles of the learners, to justify the content based on the learners‘ culture
and values, to establish challenges for the talent learners, to accomplish the learners‘ interests and
goals, to maximize the learners‘ involvement in the teaching process,and to reduce stress and
anxiety on the part of the learners (Tomlinson, 2003).
The third item in this category asked the instructors if they believe that the textbooks
introduce the students to the academic culture of their future colleges. Around 40% of the surveyed
teachers assume that the textbooks help the students to understand the academic culture in the
colleges. For example, the textbooks might contain topics that explain common rules in colleges
that did not necessarily exist in high school such as university rules and principles, college
students’ roles and duties, time management in the college life, and creating academic social
networks. Materials should be relevant to the learners to be useful for them. Dörnyei (2003) states
that language materials should be relevant for the learners because they do care about their
learning.
The textbook might include several learning-teaching strategies such as pair discussion
sharing, repetition, clarification or identification, guided reading, interview, guided writing,
brainstorming, note taking, making a presentation, guessing, classifying, understanding point of
view, evaluating, and revising. Hismanoglu (2000) stresses the importance of teaching-learning
strategies such as clarification, guessing, practice, participation in the conversation, analyzing,
evaluating, and revising the language learning process.
Pedagogical Implications and Recommendations
This analytical attempt is conducted to assess the teachers’ attitudes towards commercial
textbooks in EFL programs in Saudi Arabia. The results of the study highlighted that the
commercial textbooks used in EFL programs are quite ineffective. They do not encounter the needs
of the teachers or the students within the Saudi context. These textbooks are not considered a
perfect fit within the Saudi educational system from the language instructors’ perspectives. As the
textbooks are the major source of contact, the students have with target language; and for teachers,
they provide structure and syllabus for a program. Richards (2001), states that there should be a
complete agreement with learners, teachers and with the administration. However, as Grant (1987)
claims “the perfect book does not exist” yet one can come with the best solution available. Thus
the study recommends language instructors to adapt the available commercial textbooks according
to their context by applying the methods of simplification, reduction, modification, deletion and
editing of contents of the textbooks. They can even bring some of the language materials that are
culturally relevant and more authentic. They can even supplement their textbooks with alternative

materials available. They can use authentic materials in the classroom to make the teachinglearning process more realistic and neutral.
Teachers’ negative attitudes towards commercial textbooks act as directives for material
designers and developers. The study recommends the course designers to revise their textbooks in
a way that they suit the learners’ needs, provide them with ample opportunity to interact with
textbook’s contents, enhance their skills and motivate them towards learning. It also suggests them
to create and develop specific textbooks to cater the specific needs of the specific discipline.
Teachers also found the contents of the selection of the instructional materials will affect teachers,
students, and overall classroom dynamics. The said time frame should be kept in mind and should
be one of the most important criteria while selecting EFL textbooks. Teachers’ and students’ views
should also be given due importance. The use of systematic procedure can result in the most
potential selection and will ultimately enhance the learners’, teachers’ and administration’s
outcome.
Participants of the study revealed negative attitudes towards the course’s time frame. Now,
this brings responsibility on the EFL program administrators to evaluate and analyze textbooks
before selecting them for their programs. They should amend and reconsider their EFL textbooks
selection policies and decisions related to the textbooks which are culturally inappropriate for
KSA. Thus, it is recommended to the course designers to bear in mind the cultural sensitivity of
the region while designing textbooks. If the textbooks do not respect the cultural habit of the
students, then they will be demotivated from the textbooks. As Karmani (2005) stresses that the
material and contents of English textbooks are culturally inappropriate in the Arabian Gulf, the
publishers of these textbooks are sensitive to the marketability of their textbooks in the Arabian
Gulf region. The attempts to modify the textbooks' cultural elements such as pictures and habits
make them acceptable; however, the learners fail to understand and appreciate the target culture.
Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research
One point that might affect the results of this study is the definition of the word attitude.
The teachers’ attitudes involve the teachers’ opinions, interests, and values. Dörnyei, (2003) states
that the attitudinal questions are “abroad category that concerns attitudes, opinions, beliefs,
interests and values. These five interrelated terms are not always distinguished or defined very
clearly in the literature” (p. 7). The word attitude is abroad category. However, this study looks for
the teachers’ attitudes in general. This might not affect the results of the study. Another limitation
point in the design of the study is using questionnaires which might involve subjectivity. For
example, the researchers in the study might not know if the participants exaggerate in their answers
(Mackey & Gass, 2005; Wallace, 1998). However, the participants were informed that the study
is for research purposes and their answers are very important to make conclusions about the
textbooks.
The current research shows that there is a need for future studies that study the language
teachers’ attitudes and the use of textbooks in the classrooms (Harwood, 2010; McGrath, 2006).
Understanding the biographical factors that shape the teachers’ attitudes toward the textbooks will
help the language teaching schools and the textbooks publishers to design and provide workshops

for the teachers to change or strengthen their attitudes. This will result in practical use of the EFL
textbooks in the EFL classrooms.
Replicating the study to see similar or different findings will contribute to the research in
teachers’ attitudes toward textbooks. Language Teaching Review Panel (2008) writes, “Language
teaching is now encouraging original papers which replicate previous significant experimental
studies in the field of language learning and teaching” (p. 1). Replication will give the results of
this high validity if it has the same results. Future studies might investigate how we can change
the negative attitudes of teachers toward the textbooks. Language program can use methods such
as workshops and seminars to help the teachers to change their attitudes toward the used textbooks.
Conclusion
The present study is conducted to underscore the commercial textbooks potentiality and
suitability in EFL programs from teachers’ perspective. Teachers’ perspective towards
instructional materials is accountable as it is a predictor for course outcome. The current research
chose the quantitative method where data is collected through a close-ended questionnaire. The
questions were themed to sort out the textbooks feasibility with students’ academic backgrounds,
their proficiency level, their cultural values, courses’ aim and objectives, time frame, methodology
and content relevancy. The results of each item in the survey were then comprehensively analyzed
separately. The analysis revealed, in general, negative attitudes of teachers’ toward commercial
textbooks. They demonstrated their incompatibility with commercial textbooks. Majority of the
instructors maintained that the commercial textbooks do not consider the students ‘academic
backgrounds. This may be the reason that students coming to undergraduate program are from
varied academic background and one textbook cannot cater the background of each student as it
needs to comply with its own set standards.
Most of the instructors’ response maintained a mixed attitude with few of the textbooks
attributes, like meeting course aims and objectives, with textbooks conflict with students’ values,
beliefs, and culture. Based on the results it can be safely concluded that there are many
incompatibilities between language instructors and commercial textbooks. They possess mostly
negative attitudes toward commercial textbooks in EFL programs. Only a few attributes they
showed positive and to others, a mixed sort of attitudes. The obvious factor behind this may be
that the teachers in the study share different educational, political, economic, social and cultural
background backgrounds.
The negative attitudes of teachers raise the attention of EFL administrators to reconsider
the selection policy of the commercial textbooks. They should evaluate and select teaching
material on several criteria such as course aims and objectives, learners’ needs, cultural issues and
theory of learning. Moreover, these negative attitudes bring certain responsibilities on the teachers
themselves. The study concluded that teachers should adapt the contents of the textbook and can
supplement them with alternative and authentic materials. The results of the study are like the
indicator for the material designer to keep in mind the raised concerns and issues while developing
and designing textbooks for EFL programs in KSA. To sum up, commercial textbooks for EFL
programs in KSA need more revision, adaptation, redesigning, redeveloping to make them more
effective.
