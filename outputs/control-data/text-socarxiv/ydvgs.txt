Abstract
This study explores how ideational meaning is realized in media texts written by native and nonnative writers of English. Particularly, the paper attempts to analyze transitivity or process types
from a semantic-grammatical point of view based on Halliday's (1985) framework of Systemic
Functional Grammar. The study aims to describe and compare the process types used by the
authors to transmit their experiences/ideations and fulfill the intended purposes. To this end, eight
articles from Washington Post (WP) & Arab News (AN) online newspapers were analyzed. The
selected texts were divided into clauses and the process types (material, mental, relational, verbal,
existential & behavior) were identified and compared. The analysis reveals that the authors of both
newspapers give prominence to the use of material and relational processes seeming to focus
exclusively on the actions of physical nature and make links between actions and actors with some
qualities associated with them. The subsequently used processes in WP articles are verbal, mental
and existential; whereas in AN articles they are mental, existential and verbal. Behavior process is
the last and least frequently used process type in both newspapers articles showing that the
physiological responses of the actors are not a major involvement. However, the rates of process
types in all articles of both newspapers differ considerably. This variation is ascribed to the authors'
choice to include a process type more than the other or exclude another to transmit their own
experiences and bring about the intended purpose.

1. Introduction
Halliday (1985) states, “A fundamental property of language is that it enables human
beings to build a mental picture of reality, to make sense of their experience of what goes on around
them and inside them” (p. 101). Therefore, what writers produce in texts is a reflection of their
world experiences. However, texts are written for a particular purpose in mind. To fulfill the
intended purpose, linguistic choices have to be made and these choices are due to the writers' outer
world experiences including inner consciousness. In an attempt to understand the writer’s
underlying purpose, interpreting the context of the writing, to see why writers make the decisions
they do from the largest decisions about what information to include and what words to use; a
lexico-grammatical analysis of Transitivity was carried out from the perspective of Systematic
Functional Grammar. “Transitivity specifies the different types of process that are recognized in
the language, and the structures by which they are expressed” (Halliday, 1985). So, through clause
analysis using transitivity system we can realize all the processes in a language and know how
writers state their experience in the world.
2. Literature Review
According to Halliday (1985, citeded in Mehmood, Amber, Ameer & Faiz, 2014, p. 79 )
language is used functionally, what is said depends on what one needs to accomplish. Halliday &
Hassan (1985) describe the Systematic Functional Grammar (SFG) view of language as “attempt
to relate Language primarily to a particular aspect of human experience, namely, that of social
structure” (p. 4). This implies that language use is viewed as a system of choices made among
other options within the context.
The context of the situation is thus arranged in categories. They are Field, Tenor and Mode.
Halliday's ideas of metafunctions; the ideational, interpersonal and textual are corresponding to
them respectively. According to him, each of these metafunctions is related to grammatical
systems. Experiential/ideational Metafunction considers grammar of a clause as representation,
and it is realized by the systems of transitivity, whereas Interpersonal Metafunction reflects
grammar of a clause as exchange and the systems of mood and modality recognize it. Textual
Metafunction looks at the grammar of clause as message and it is realized by the systems of theme
and Rheme . Our major concern in this work lies in the grammatical choice of transitivity system
or process types.
According to Fowler (1986) transitivity refers to how meaning is represented in clauses;
transitivity patterns can reveal the certain worldview “framed by the authorial ideology” (p.138).
Mehmood, Amber, Ameer & Faiz (2014) refer "transitivity can show how speakers/writers
encode in language their mental reflection of the world and how they account for their experience
of the world around them" (p. 80).
The Hallidayian proposed transitivity system consists of three major types of processes,
they are, material, mental, and relational. Other three minor types: the behavioral, verbal, and
existential processes are also identified by Halliday which lie on the boundaries of the major
processes. Each process type provides its own model or schema for construing a particular domain
of experience (Halliday &Matthiessen, 2004).

According to Halliday (1994), each situation includes three constituents: “the process itself,
participants in the process, and the circumstances associated with the process” (p.107).The process
is recognized by a verb and it is the essential part of the situation. A nominal group considers
participants and circumstances are realized by adverbial groups or prepositional phrases. For the
current study, detailed analysis of the six process types are carried out. But analysis of the
participants and circumstances are not dealt with.
The process types are clarified by Ezzina (2015, pp. 287-288) as follows:
-The Material process includes clauses of doing and happening.
-The Mental processes are grouped into four subtypes which are perception (see, hear, feel),
cognition (know, understand, believe), affection (like, love), and desire (hope, want, wish).
-The relational process occurs outside and inside human being. Relational processes are typically
realized by the verb ‘be’ or some verbs of the same class (known as copular verbs); for examples,
seem, become, appear, etc., or sometime by verbs such as have, own, possess. This type is realized
by the verbs: sound, look, play, cost, have, get, seem, etc.
-The behavioral process lies between the material and mental processes. It characterizes the outer
expression of inner working and reflects physiological and psychological behaviors.
-The verbal process is between mental and relational processes, which represents the act of saying.
- The existential process is between relational and material processes which proves states of being,
existing, and happening. Existential processes typically employ the verb be which follows [there]
or its synonyms such as exist, arise, occur.
3. Purpose of Study
The main purpose of this study is to explore and compare how ideational meaning and
purposes are realized in media texts written by native and non-native writers of English from
two online newspapers through the analysis of transitivity or process types within the framework
of SFG.
4. Data Description
The data for analysis in this study comprises eight online articles; four from Washington
Post (WP) newspaper and the other four articles are from Arab News (AN) newspaper. Selection
of the sample articles is based on two factors: authenticity and variation of topics. The selected
articles were paired; one from the WP and the other from AN for the sake of comparison. Each
pair deals with different topic, but articles in the same pair discuss similar idea.
For the following analysis, Texts' transitivity is examined exploring the mentioned six
process types, adopting the criteria set by Halliday, but the detailed analysis of the participant types
has not been dealt with in the present work. First, clauses in WP & AN articles were identified.
Secondly, clause constituents were determined considering the type of the process (verbal phrases)
that was used in the clause. Then, the frequencies and percentages were calculated for each
category. Finally, tables of frequency and percentage were formed for each newspaper articles.
(For full texts of the data, the articles' links are provided in the appendix) A comparison between
data from each table was made.

Before doing any further analysis, it is worth mentioning that the length of articles in pairs
differs noticeably. Despite the choice of articles from WP and AN was made on the basis of topic
similarity dealt with in each newspaper, they remained unequal in length. As long as the total
number of process types of per article are concerned, the above tables show that AN articles are
longer than WP articles in pair 1 & 2, whereas it is the reverse in pair 3 & 4. The density of process

types in certain articles points out that they are more informative than the others including many
details.
Since it seems there is no one to one relationship to account for the length of the articles, we
may assume that the authors' origin factor; being native or non-native of English, does not affect
the information density.
5.1. Material Process
The predominance of material process in all pair articles except pair 3 indicates that the
writers of both newspapers, WP & AN, have a tendency to focus on the expression of 'doing and
happening' and doers of actions to transmit their external experiences as far as they are reporting
facts about particular issues. Despite the difference of the authors' origins , their matrix of thoughts
and the texts' contexts, both WP and AN newspapers center exclusively on using the material
process to give details on actions and doings to fulfill the writing purposes.
The following are examples from each pair, though they deal with similar topics, they
display that the writers used certain actions and definite clause structures through different wordchoice to manifest their writing purposes. Hence, they bring about some world realties as they
experienced.
Pair 1 :
a- "The price tag of the bailout is suddenly going up. As a result, the
administration said it will seek twice as much money from its proposed bank
tax …" [WP 1]
b- "the administration put the cost of the government's financial rescue at $28
billion. Now, it's expected to reach $54 billion". [WP 1]
c- "The proposed "Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee," which would charge
big banks $61 billion over 10 years, would square with President Obama's
political strategy to harness the anger against Wall Street reelection
campaign". [WP 1]
d- "The tax would apply to J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and other banks with
more than $50 billion in assets, even though these firms have generally
repaid their bailouts to the Treasury with interest. Taxpayers may lose far
more money in companies, such as the automakers, which won't have to pay
the fee". [WP 1]
e- "What's more, the bailout also sets aside $46 billion for programs to help
homeowners. But only $3.3 billion has gone out the door for this purpose,
and it is difficult to know how much will ultimately be spent". [WP 1]
f- "Together with the 2014 budget, the government issued the most detailed
statement to date about actual performance of both government finances and
the economy as a whole during 2013. Government expenditure rose in 2013
to $247 billion, an increase of 15 percent over 2012. Spending went over
budgeted outlays by about 13 percent. Remarkably, however, despite lavish
government expenditure, the economy did not heat up. Inflation was kept at
around three percent (3.35%), only slightly over the 2012 level of 2.9
percent". [AN 1]

g- "Actual revenue in 2013 exceeded budgeted revenue by a massive 34 percent.
However, the government statement reveals a substantial drop in actual oil
revenue from the previous year. While oil revenue hit the record level of
$1,140 billion in 2012, it has declined to $1,017 billion in 2013, a drop of
about 11 percent". [AN 1]
h- "Looking at GDP components, we see that oil GDP in fact declined in 2013
by nearly four percent, while non-oil sector grew by over 9 percent. The
healthy growth in the private sector moderated the impact of the oil sector
decline, pointing again to the significance of economic diversification…."
[AN 1]
These examples show that the WP author's purpose is to present facts concerning the budget and
describe some economic issues in the present and relate it to future planning and expectations. So,
through the choice of material process (e.g. going up, seek, pay, repaid, lose, apply, spent, …etc.),
and relating them to participants/ doers/ actors such as (administration- taxpayers, automakers)
the author could achieve his writing purpose and influences the readers about the subject matter
showing what he knows and what he does not. Besides, the use of modal operators in verb groups
adds influential sense about the writer's expectations.
As the example above illustrates, the AN author's purpose is to deal with the governmental
recent years financial and economic performances and compare them with previous years and
private sectors. So, the use of the material processes ( e. g. issued, rose, went over, kept, exceeded,
declined, grew) in the past tense form- with actors like (government, economy, spending, oil
revenue, growth, private sector) were appropriate to accomplish his purpose of writing. The
comparative structure used by the author makes the statements more influential.
On the other hand, processes of knowledge formation are implied in the authors' language
use of verbal phrases. Through the use of future tense along with present tense, the WP writer
showed that he built his expectations for the future budget depending on current resources or
experiences. But, the AN writer showed that he has an exposure to KSA previous years' budget
and performances while discussing the current one as long as the past tense is the most frequent.
So he depended on his previous experience or encountered knowledge to introduce his ideas.
Pair 2:
a- "Men were hit harder and earlier by job losses than women in the downturn".
[WP 2]
b- "But men are also recovering faster and have made back about 28 percent
of the 6.1 million jobs they’ve lost; women have regained about 10.8
percent". [WP 2]
c- "Women get back into the workforce". [WP 2]
d- "While unemployment rates for Saudi men moved slightly downwards
between the first and fourth quarters, they declined dramatically for nonSaudi men and non-Saudi women. However, for Saudi women, unemployment
rates continued their upward climb from previous years" [AN 2]

e- "For non-Saudi men and women, unemployment also declined at a much
brisker rate during 2012". [AN 2]
f- "For non-Saudi men and women, unemployment also declined at a much
brisker rate during 2012". [AN 2]
g- "women who have been seriously searching for work during the month
preceding the survey. It thus does not include in the rate those women who
are not looking for work" [AN 2]
h- "Saudi Arabia has made great advances in educating women" [AN 2]
Both writers of WP & AN discussed the issue of unemployment & gender showing the
employment gap between men and women. Each author referred to his related context; the
American and Saudi one. So we find different word choice of material processes connected
with particular participants, and different comparative styles. For instance, The WP used
verb phrases such as (men are recovering/ have made back, women have regained /get
back), but the AN author used (Saudi men moved downwards /they declined / Saudi women
unemployment rates continued upward/ non-Saudi men and women, unemployment also
declined/ women who have been searching /who are not looking for/ Saudi Arabia has
made). In addition, the AN author included several statistics regarding men and women's
unemployment rates to achieve the intended purposes. All these components (the
participants, the process types, the comparative style and the statistical figures) hang
together and support the authors' intentions to produce influential texts.
Pair 3:
a- "Thousands of book enthusiasts flocked to the Mall on Saturday to experience
the small but exuberant world of literature". [WP 3]
b- "The event, organized by the Library of Congress" [WP 3]
c- "DeLillo, whose 1985 novel, “White Noise,” won the National Book Award"
[WP 3]
d- "DeLillo will receive the award at a public ceremony on the Mall on Sunday".
[WP 3]
e- "The Riyadh International Book Fair 2014 was inaugurated by Culture and
Information Minister Abdulaziz Khoja". [AN 3]
f- "The book fair focused on Saudi-Spanish relations". [AN 3]
g- "The book fair serves as a great networking platform for publishers, writers
and scholars, as well as academic institutions". [AN 3]
The material process in pair 3 does not constitute high frequency. In WP article the rate is 20.45
% and it is 18.75 % in AN article. This low frequency shows that the writers' major intention was
not to present the participants' doings and actions. Instead, we realize that the WP author's chief
purpose is to report the National Book Festival visitors' opinions and insights as long as the verbal
process forms the highest frequency rate in the article. For the AN article, the relational process
was the author's concentration as it forms a rate of 37.5 % to total process types. This highest rate
of relational process reveals the author's intention to identify and classify the books in the
International Book Fair in Riyadh. In addition, the material processes such as (focused & serves )

make a clear indication about the writing purpose as to illuminate the International Book Fair
value.
Pair 4 :
a. "Nick Lynch, the Suitland High School football coach and athletic director
and one of the most respected figures in Prince George's County athletics,
was killed early yesterday morning in a two-car collision about a mile from
his Brandywine home". [WP 4]
b. "Lynch -- known as "Nick," even though his given name was David -- was
traveling south on Branch Avenue about 2:30 a.m. when he attempted to
turn left onto Brandywine Road, said Trooper Wesley Brown of the
Maryland State Police. Lynch's car, a 2008 Dodge Magnum, was struck by
a 2000 GMC Sierra traveling north on Branch Avenue, Brown said". [WP
4]
c. "He took over a Suitland program in 1996 that had never made the playoffs
and turned it into a state power, winning two Maryland championships and
qualifying for the playoffs nine times in his 13 years. He also never stopped
doing the little things; he usually collected yard-markers and goal-post
pads after home games and occasionally could be found making sure the
bathrooms were clean". [WP 4]
d. "He tried to give his players a family atmosphere that some of them may
have lacked at home. His players regularly joined Lynch for services at the
Ebenezer AME church in Fort Washington, and he held postgame meals
for his team in the school gymnasium". [WP 4]
e. "It takes a special guy to work at Suitland and be effective at Suitland. And
he was the guy". [WP 4]
f. "the veteran player died on the spot when the BMW car he was driving at
top speed flipped over after the front tire burst throwing him 80 meters
away from the scene of the accident". [AN 4]
g. "Saad and his friends were coming from the Eastern Province to Riyadh
traveling on the Dammam-Riyadh highway. The accident happened 180
kilometers away from Riyadh". [AN 4]
h. "Al-Dossary began his professional career at Riyadh Club. In 2002 he
transferred to Al-Ahli" [AN 4]
Both newspapers deal with the death of a sportsman. But the two authors reported the news
differently. WP author did not only report the death of 'Nick Lynch' but he also presented
some interviews with his family and friends (as long as some verbal process are included)
and gave a brief history of his achievements and contributions to society through material
processes as in examples c & d (never stopped doing , collected ,could be found making ,
give , joined , held ). This can be considered a cultural aspect as it is experienced by the WP
author, especially when this article is compared to the corresponding article in the same
pair. The author in AN article was stuck to present details about the accident through
material processes as (was driving , flipped over, burst throwing) and just reporting the
death of "Al-Dossary'' without adding any information about his life and contributions, apart
from his shift to 'Hilal' team as in example h through the verbs (began & transferred). Such

Alraimi & Abdalla

a way of reporting death news in AN is also considered a cultural issue since good deeds
and social contributions of a person are not publically posted in Saudi Arabia.
Additionally, the expression 'guy' occurs 4 times as goal in the WP article to refer to the
dead man 'Nick Lynch' with the main aim to praise him. If the writer in AN newspaper uses 'guy'
to refer to the Saudi dead man, it would be seen as disrespectful. This is, in fact, a purely cultural
way of experiencing things. Here, we may draw an assumption that cultural aspect affect the
reporting style and word choice of participants and process types.
The material process utilized by the authors shows their different word-choices and their
appropriateness to contexts bringing about the intended purpose. The choices display what they
experienced, what they know about the concerned topic, and what they expect to be done.
5.2. Mental Process
The use of mental process represents the writers' internal experiences; their feelings and
personal point of view. Below are some examples from the pair articles.
Pair 1:
a- "But Obama's team may see political advantage in its proposal…". [WP 1]
b- "Administration officials note that, under the law that created TARP, they
are required to recoup the costs of the financial bailout". [WP 1]
c- "Looking at GDP components, we see that oil GDP in fact declined in
2013". [AN 1]
d- "Looking at the trade side of things, we also see a drop in the overall value
of exports….." [AN 1]
e- "looking at trade more closely, we see a more pronounced drop in the
value of oil exports" [AN 1]
As long as pair 1 articles are concerned, the writers differ considerably in their attitudes. The WP
writer seemed to have neutral tone reporting facts about the United State budget depicting the
participants' cognitions or senses and detaching himself from them. 'Obama's team' &
'Administration officials' are the participants in WP examples whose mental processes are (see &
note). Here the writer did not include himself and therefore he did not express his believe or point
of view, but rather transmitting experiences he encountered with. So, he appeared to be neutral or
objective.
On the contrary, the AN writer in order to transmit his inner believe regarding the Saudi
budget, he included himself with the audience and shared them their cognitions and senses in
process as (looking & see). He made use of the first person plural pronoun 'We' showing the
inclusion with the audience to express his internal views influencing them to accept these views.
In pair 2, the WP writer did not use mental process. Accordingly, his inner experience or
consciousness was not revealed. The participants' emotions, feelings and cognitions were not
apparent insofar as they were not depicted as sensors or cognizants. Quite the reverse, the AN

Alraimi & Abdalla

author transmitted his inner consciousness through the use of mental process (expected & look).
Illustrations are shown below:
a- "As expected in a segmented labor market, unemployment rates in Saudi
Arabia are drastically different between Saudis and non-Saudis, as well as
between men and women". [Cognition] [AN 2]
b- "Let us look more closely at the unemployment rates for each of the four
groups. For Saudi men, unemployment declined from (6.9) percent in the
first quarter of 2012 to (6) percent in the fourth quarter, or a (13) percent
decline, thus reversing a decade-long trend of rising unemployment among
Saudi males".[Cognition] [AN 2]
In a example, the doer is not stated as the verb phrase is used in the passive voice 'As expected',
but it is implied as 'WE'. Here, with the use of mental process, the author manifested his internal
ideas and awareness about the subject matter trying to convince the readers by including them in
'we' as it is implied. Similarly, in example b there is an apparent inclusion of the author with the
audience through the use of the first person plural pronoun 'us' attempting to influence the readers
communicating with them mentally.
Unlike pair 2, the WP article in pair 3 is characterized by the use of mental process while
AN article is not. This, in fact, proves that it is the authors' choice to select particular process types
and avoid others in order to transmit their experiences and fulfill the intended purposes and
influence the readers. Below are some examples:
a- "they heard their favorite authors…" [Sense] [WP 3]
b- "that experience inspired him to work …" [Cognition] [WP 3]
c- "she enjoyed interacting with famous costumed characters…" [Feeling]
[WP 3]
d- "the girl who knows all the words in the dictionary". [Cognition] [WP 3]
e- "Tania and her three younger siblings also listened to Nelson talk…" [Sense]
[WP 3]
f- "she looks forward each year to meeting her favorite authors…" [Feeling]
[WP 3]
Hence, the WP author's inner consciousness, as he experienced, was exposed to the readers through
the participants' depiction as sensors. As the author's main purpose was to report the visitors'
insights and opinion about the International Book Festival, the choice of certain mental processes
(the bold ones above) support the transmission of the participants' (the visitors') feelings and
cognitions. The readers can realize these feelings and have mental impact.
In pair 4, both WP and AN authors used mental process but with different rates (2.59 %
for WP vs. 8.10 % for AN ). Even though the length of the WP article is longer than the AN
article, the rate of mental process use in AN is higher than WP use. This again is ascribed to the
author's choice to include a particular portion of a process type or another. However, it also could
be attributed to authors' different intentions in reporting the events. The WP writer intended to
include many quotations or indirect speech to report the death of a football coach. Hence, the

mental process did not form the majority of occurrence, instead, it is the verbal process. So, many
of the writer's own words were not exposed to the readers but someone else's words. In contrast,
the AN writer used direct speech uncovering his personal words to the readers transmitting the
participants' mental states. (Regarding direct and indirect speech, more explanation will be
provided in the discussion of verbal process).
a- "Lynch -- known as Nick" [WP 4]
b- "Police theorized the accident" [AN 4]
c- "Saad was last seen at Hilal club on Wednesday" [AN 4]
5.3. Relational Process
Among the six major types of process, relational process forms the second large group in
the pair articles. Writers of both newspapers, WP & AN, use the relational process to provide
descriptive information about the phenomenon concerned and qualities of the relevant participants.
Tables 1 & 2 above display that the relational usage percentages vary from one article to
another in all pairs. The higher rate in a particular article signifies that more descriptive information
is included. Therefore, realization of the process type supports the audience getting the author's
intended purpose whether to describe, to inform, to argue or to transmit opinion.
The relational process type is oriented with being, possessing and becoming. It means that
an entity has some characteristics that ascribed to it. Below are some examples:
Pair 1:
a- "A main reason for the increased bailout cost is that the government's
stock holdings of companies rescued by taxpayers have fallen in value"
[WP 1]
b- "Shares of AIG and GM, for instance, are above what they were at the
end of November" [WP 1]
c- "The bright spot of the financial rescue is the program to aid banks".
[WP 1]
d- "This is the sixth budget since the global financial crisis". [AN 1]
e- "government finances remain solid" [AN 1]
f- "Slow implementation has been the bane of many ordinary Saudis".
[AN 1]
Pair 2:
g- "The hiring gap is partly attributable to the fact that men and women
are concentrated in different industries" [WP 2]
h- "Women, by contrast, hold an outsize number of public-sector jobs"
[WP 2]
i- "Physical infrastructure projects that have been at the heart of most
Democratic recovery plans" [WP 2]
j- "unemployment rates in Saudi Arabia are drastically different between
Saudis and non-Saudis, as well as between men and women". [AN 2]

k- "The only losers among the four groups were Saudi women". [AN 2]
l- "they are too discouraged" [AN 2]
m- "They …..do not have the means to “seriously” or properly search for
employment" [AN 2]
n- "unemployed Saudi women hold university degrees". [AN 2]
Pair 3:
o- "The event….has become a must-go-to event in Washington" [WP 3]
p- "The event is even popular with young readers". [WP 3]
q- "A large number of senior Saudi officials, intellectuals, publishers,
scholars and writers were present to boost nationalization initiatives by
the Saudi government". [AN 3]
r- "The book fair serves as a great networking platform for publishers"
[AN 3]
s- "The Riyadh International Book Fair is the most prominent book fair in the Middle
East". [AN 3]
Pair 4:
t- "Nick," even though his given name was David". [WP 4]
u- "The accident remains under investigation". [WP 4]
v- "Lynch, 43, carried an immense stature in the District Heights
community". [WP 4]
w- "Lynch became adept at helping his team" [WP 4]
x- "Turki Al-Ammar was in serious condition and with broken ribs" [AN
4]
These examples prove that the writers have expressed their views and knowledge in a natural way
which unconsciously draw the audience's acceptance. Via relational process choice, they provided
descriptive information including possession as in examples ( h, m, n & v), becoming as in ( e, o,
r, u & w ), and being relations as in instances (a, b, c, d, f, g, I, j, k, l, p, q, s, t &x ).
5.4. Verbal Process
Verbal process is also used by WP and AN authors to indicate the ‘saying’ and encode the
physical act of speaking. According to tables 1 & 2, the portions of verbal process usage vary in
the pair articles and it is not used by AN author in article 2.
Through the use of verbal process, the voices of the participants other than the writers’
were also heard. The verbal process usage develops the use of quoted speech. The quoted language
presents a speech said by others. Here the writers intend not only to enable the readers read the
speech, but also they want them to hear it as it is actually spoken by others. Direct speech is also
employed by the authors to give a more dramatic effect on meaning by reporting heard speech
using their own words and expressions. By doing this, the two voices (the heard one and the
writer's) are combined and not distinguished.
Examples are listed below:
Pair 1:

a- "Despite claims to the contrary, the facts on [the federal rescue] are very
clear: …….," Frank Keating, president and chief executive of the
American Bankers Association, said Monday". [WP 1]
b- He added, "This would simply be an arbitrary tax with no regard to where
losses actually occurred." [WP 1]
c- "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah has several times
publicly admonished ministers and other officials about unfinished
projects". [AN 1]
d- He said, "We realize that what matters is not budget figures, but what they
represent in reality as projects" [AN 1]
In these examples, the writers used the verbal process to introduce quoted speech supporting their
claims and confirming their viewpoints adding more proofs of what they believe.
Pair 2:
a- "As the stimulus revealed, physical infrastructure projects often proved to
be daunting logistical endeavors, some of which were not as “shovelready” as promised". [WP 2]
In this example, the WP author presents his point of view about 'infrastructure projects' showing
how his knowledge or point of view was built; on the basis of a previous encounter or stimulus
stated in the clause 'As the stimulus revealed'. Then the verbal clause in the same example ' as
promised' shows the author's other source for his experience or knowledge. He stated that physical
infrastructure projects were not as “shovel-ready”. The idiom "shovel-ready" means that projects
are complete. The clause 'as promised' indicates that the writer heard someone else had spoken
this before, "that the projects would be complete", but he is opposing the idea.
The verbal process 'as promised' displays the use of 'intertextuality', i. e., including
someone else's speech or thoughts. In this case, it is used not to confirm the author's stand or claim;
but rather to introduce an opposition state.
For this pair, the AN author did not use a verbal process or clause. This seems to be due to
the way he presented his topic about unemployment where he included several statistics comparing
gender's opportunities in the present and the past and there seemed no need to include any reported
speech or other forms of intertextuality.
Pair 3 :
a- "authors read from their most recent works and discuss a range of topics"
[WP 3]
b- "Illustrator and author Kadir Nelson told a crowd of young readers about
memorizing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech"
[WP 3]
c- "Singer and songwriter Linda Ronstadt discussed her new book, “Simple
Dreams: A musical Memoir,” and weighed in on the debate over
immigration" [WP 3]

d- "The event is even popular with young readers. Tania Mendez-Lopez, 11,
of the District said she enjoyed interacting with famous costumed
characters" [WP 3]
e- "Saleh Al-Ghamdi, director of the Riyadh International Book Fair, said:
“There is a special pavilion for Saudis….." [AN 3]
The excerpts in this pair illustrate that the verbal process is employed not only to present reported
speech directly or indirectly, but also to convey the participants' physical act of speaking (consider
examples a & c ).
Pair 4:
a- "It was an accident that I deal with all the time in my career," said
Gansert" [WP 4]
b- "The football players had great respect for him," said Lynch's brother"
[WP 4]
c- " According to doctors at the hospital, Saad died from head injuries
which resulted in severe internal bleeding. The other casualty, doctors
added, also died from similar injuries. The manager of the ambulance
department at the hospital said that the final medical report would be
released tomorrow." [AN 4]
In this pair extracts, the authors also used the verbal process type to introduce quoted speech
directly and indirectly to confirm their statements and get the readers convinced. The phrases
'according to, added, & said' point out the verbal process. Though the phrase 'according to' is not
a verb phrase, but it implies the act of speaking. In example c the author paraphrases a heard speech
said earlier. He states "According to doctors at the hospital…". Instead, it is possible to state
"doctors at the hospital said…" changing the paraphrased statement into reported speech. In
addition, the verb 'added' may not denote the act of speaking if it is used in another context. So, it
is worth to note that verbs may be used in more than one way- the lexico-grammartical context
determines the process type.
5.5. Existential Process
Existential process did not constitute a large portion among the process types. The reason
why existential process was infrequently used compared to the material processes is that, in the
pair articles the writers were largely concerned with the concrete or physical actions of the
participants. Only on a few occasions, existential clauses were chosen so as to introduce the
presence of a participant, or express positional states. In addition, such process type also tells the
readers to what will take place or be detailed in the following discourse.
A correlation between tables 1& 2 above, it appears that the AN authors tend to use the
existential process in their produced texts more than that of the WP authors. The total number of
existential process frequency in AN articles is 13 while it is 7 in WP ones. This constitutes a total
percentage of 37.43% for AN and 13.95 % for WP.
Some extractions from the pair articles are listed below.

a- "The bank tax first appeared in Obama's 2011 budget" [WP 1]
b- "if the two trends continue in future years, we can expect to see a budget deficit
before too long". [AN 1]
c- "there was only a modest growth in GDP of only two percent" [AN 1]
d- "There are no published precise figures for the number of unfinished project"

"there’s also evidence that women lost jobs" [WP 2]
"There may be more direct ways to create jobs" [WP 2]
"There is some good news as well as bad in the new figures" [AN 2]
"there was also a sharp decline in the unemployment rate" [AN 2]
"there are differentials in their unemployment rates". [AN 2]
"there were (604) thousand women employed" [AN 2]
"There are in fact more women university students than men in Saudi Arabia"
[AN 2]

Pair 3:
l- "The two-day festival continues Sunday" [WP 3]
m- "A large number of senior Saudi officials, intellectuals, publishers, scholars and
writers were present to boost nationalization initiatives by the Saudi
government".[AN 3]
n- "A large number of books on Islam, Arab culture, medicine, law, science,
technology and communication, in addition to biographical accounts, fiction and
novels are available in the fair" [AN 3]
o- "This event is being held for the second time" [AN 3]
Pair 4 :
p- "Gansert, a former head football coach at Fairmont Heights and now an assistant
at Eleanor Roosevelt in Greenbelt, was less than a mile away after leaving a
house fire" [WP 4]
q- "He always said there is nothing promised" [WP 4]
r- "he pulled his team off the field with 1 minute 29 seconds remaining to protest
the officiating" [WP 4]
s- "The accident happened 180 kilometers away from Riyadh" [AN 4]
t- "the Asian championship in Lebanon in 2000 and 17th Gulf Cup, which was held
in Qatar recently". [AN 4]
The choice of the existential process as shown in the examples above, expose the writers'
experienced knowledge and purpose for the discussed subject matters. It is mainly employed by
authors of both newspapers to present the existence of an event or entity rather than to show the
positional states or what will take place or be detailed in the following discourse. This assumption
is proper at least as far as the sample articles are concerned. The existence of an event or entity is
illustrated in examples a, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, q, r & t. Unequally, there is only one case
in which existential process is used to express what will take place next as in example b ; and other
two instances to indicate positional states as in p & s.

5.6. Behavior Process
Behavior process is the second least occurrence among the six process types. Besides, it
did not occur in pair 1 AN article and pair 2 both articles. This could be construed that the writers'
chief intention was not to report the participants' physiological responses or the results of the
material process produced by them. Instead, the writers were informative reporting facts about
particular issues.
Unlike the existential process occurrence in WP articles in comparison to AN ones, the
behavior process marks a higher portion of usage in the WP texts than the AN texts. The total
number of this process frequency in WP articles is 6 when it is only 4 in AN. The variation of
processes rates remains the authors' choice to include a particular process more than the other or
exclude another based on their own experiences trying to transmit their knowledge and bring about
the intended purpose in line with the targeted audience.
Some illustrations are presented below; the behavior process verbs are bold and underlined:
Pair 1:
a- "The Obama administration has repeatedly boasted how the historic
rescue of Wall Street will cost taxpayers" [WP 1]
b- "Republicans pledged to oppose the tax" [WP 1]
Pair 3 :
a- "They waited excitedly at standing-room-only readings and packed
author appearances, hopping from event to event". [WP 3]
b- "Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood drew laughs from the audience
when she talked about the competition betweene-readers and paper
books". [WP 3]
c- "Khoja expressed gratitude to Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King
Abdullah and welcomed Spain as the guest of honor for 2014". [AN 3]
Pair 4:
a- "Lynch didn't hide his emotions. In a 2003 playoff loss to Eleanor
Roosevelt, he pulled his team off the field" [WP 4]
b- "In deference to his death the long-awaited clash between rivals Hilal of
Riyadh and Al-Ittihad of Jeddah in the King Fahd Cup today in Riyadh
was postponed to a later date". [AN 4]
c- "he did training before taking permission from Hilal officials to drive his
family to the Eastern Province" [AN 4]
In fact, depicting the participants as behavers or physiological beings, acting out with
consciousness unfolds the authors' inner experiences to the readers' eyes who may get influenced
by their responses.
6. Findings
With the major objective to explore the ideational meaning or the transmission of the
writers' world experiences to bring about some intended purposes, a lexico-grammatical analysis
has been attempted on eight articles from two newspapers, the Washington Post and Arab News,

detecting the process types. The analysis reveals that there is no one to one relationship to account
for the length of the articles as the total number of all process types in per article randomly form
inequality. AN articles are longer than WP articles in pair 1 & 2 , whereas it is the reverse in pair
3 &4 . Building on this result, it is assumed that the authors' origin factor; being native or nonnative of English does not affect the information density. On the other hand, considering the
process types frequency, the authors of both newspapers give the material and relational processes
a prominence of frequency use to transmit their world experiences. The material process discloses
the actions of physical nature which are employed by the authors. The relational process makes
links between the actions as well as the actors with some qualities that are associated with them.
Then the verbal process is the third frequent occurrence in WP articles but it is the fifth in AN
ones. This represents that more intertextuality (reported speech) is used by WP authors to confirm
and provide more evidence for their claims. While mental process is the fourth frequency in WP
article, it is the third in AN ones. This reveals less inner status and psychological concerns are
showed by WP authors as compared to AN writers. Thus the AN authors' inner consciousness and
insights are more exposed to the readers than the WP authors. As still there is no much
involvement with the mental process paralleled to material and relational processes, the authors
appear to be more objective in nature than being subjective. Consequently, the readers may be led
to frame their own insights on the basis of the actions represented through material and relational
processes. Existential process is the fifth in WP and the fourth in AN articles. This embodies less
positional states and presence of an entity are depicted in the articles. The behavior process is the
last and least occurrence in both newspapers articles showing that the physiological responses of
the actors are not a major concentration in the articles. However, the rates of process types in all
articles of both newspapers differ considerably. This variation is ascribed to the authors' choice to
include a process type more than the other or exclude another to transmit their own experiences
and bring about the intended purpose trying to influence the readers.
7. Conclusion
Through the analysis we realize that despite the topic similarity of each pair, the texts'
contexts of WP and AN articles differ remarkably along with the writing purposes. Different
writing purposes led the authors select certain words and structures and avoid others through
diverse process types as they served their purposes and the target audience. Thus, realization of
the process types support the audience getting the authors' intended purposes and understanding
their ideas.
