The Effect of Scale, Technique, Composition and Trade Openness on Energy Demand:
Fresh Evidence from Malaysia
Abstract: The aim of this paper utilizes an energy demand model to investigate the impact of
trade openness on energy consumption by incorporating scale and technique, composition and
urbanization effects in the case of Malaysia. The study covers the sample period of 1970-2011
using quarter frequency data. We applied the bounds testing approach in the presence of
structural breaks to examine the long run relationship between the variables. The VECM Granger
causality is used to detect the direction of causality between the variables. Our findings indicate
that growth effect (scale and technique effect) has a positive (negative) impact on energy
consumption whereas composition effect stimulates energy demand in Malaysia.. Energy
consumption is positively influenced by both from openness and urbanization. This study opens
new policy insights for policy making authorities to articulate a comprehensive energy and trade
policy to sustain economic growth and improve the environmental quality of Malaysia.
Keywords: Trade Openness, Energy Demand, Malaysia

Introduction
Energy utilization plays a crucial role in any modern industrial economy, since it can
influence the level of productivity of other underlying production inputs. The debate between
energy utilization and the rate of economic growth has been extensive, predominantly since the
occurrence of the oil shocks in the 1970s. According to the International Energy Agency has
projected that the global primary energy demand will rise by 40% from its 2007 level by 2030
(IEA, 2009). The non-OECD nations collectively will account for over 90% of this increase;
their share of global primary energy demand will rise from 52% to 63%. The consumption of
fossil fuels by these countries will continue to dominate the energy scenario, accounting for 77%
of the global rise; their demand for fossil oil is projected to increase from the 85 million barrels
per day in 2008 to 105 million barrels per day in 2030, rising 24% of the demand.
Trade liberalization promotes economic growth through the industrialization. In order to
build a sound export oriented industrial sector, energy is the key resources to fulfilled its
demand. It is required for the newly industrialized countries to increase their export growth
through the specialization in production that will stimulate a higher degree of competition, scale
of economics and technology transfer. On the other hand, the role of imports allows the
technology transfer and factors of production that will create the energy demand in the country.
The discussion explained that trade openness creates the energy demand in three channels such
as, growth effect, scale effect and technology effect.
This study may have a comprehensive effort on this topic of the economy of Malaysia and
it will five ways contribution to the literature by applying: (i) Both conventional and structural
break unit root tests; (ii) The ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration for the long run
relationship between the variables. (iii) OLS and ECM for the long run and short run impacts (iv)
The VECM Granger causality approach for a causal relationship is applied.
The rest of the paper is organized as the following. Section 2 outlines the literature review.
The data and the underlying methodology are clarified in Section 3. Empirical findings are
presented in Section 4 and the last section concludes the paper.

Literature Review
2

In earlier literature on energy economics, there has been a large number of empirical
studies on the positive association between energy consumption and the stage of economic
growth of the country. Economic development is influenced by the amount of energy usage as
well as primary inputs usage (Beaudreau, 1995) in the production function. The intensified
interest by the major economic powers of the world to gain a firm foothold on energy based
regions across the globe is a testimony to the fact that energy will remain a major focus in the
foreseeable future. The battle for such control will also increase as more energy will be needed to
meet the demand for future economic growth. On the other hand, there has been an increased
pressure from the developed economics to reduce CO2 emissions in order to reduce the rate of
global warming and climate change. Therefore, emerging and industrialized countries are
concerned about their negative effects on economic growth caused by the restricted use of
energy.
There are a large number of empirical literatures on the relationship between energy
consumption and economic growth. Using the annual data from 1948 to 1994, Stern (2000)
examined the relationships between income, energy consumption, labor market and capital
stocks in the United States of America (USA). He concluded that there is a mutual causality
between energy consumption and GDP in the USA. On the other hand, Wolde-Rufael (2005)
found conflicting evidences with the neutrality hypothesis supported in a substantial number of
countries, with little support for the hypothesis that energy consumption causes economic
growth. According to the eighteen developing countries, Lee (2006) found that causality running
from energy consumption to economic growth but not vice versa applying the panel
cointegration approach. A group of six Gulf Cooperation countries, Al-Iriani (2006) found a
unidirectional causality running from economic growth in energy consumption. According to
Richmond and Kaufmann (2006) included energy consumption in their analysis and find a
relationship between income and energy consumption and emission. Using a tri-variate model,
Soytas and Sari (2006) failed to identify a significant Granger causality link between any of the
variables. Recent study by, Lorde et al. (2010) used capital, labor, technology, and energy as
separate inputs to test the existence of the long - run relationship between output growth and
electrical energy usage and suggested long-run relationship between growth and electricity
consumption and bidirectional causality between electrical energy consumption and real GDP in
the long-run. However, the causality is unidirectional from energy to the output in the short-run.
A study by Latin America, Apergis and Payne (2009) found both short-run and long-run
causality from energy consumption to economic growth applying the panel cointegration
method. Uddin et al. (2011) supported that unidirectional causality runs from energy
consumption to economic in case of Bangladesh. On the contrary, Shahbaz and Lean (2012b)
found that economic growth Granger causes energy consumption in Tunisia. Recently, Shahbaz
et al. (2012) reported feedback hypothesis between energy consumption and economic growth in
Pakistan.
The effect of trade liberalization on energy consumption is relatively new in the energyincome literature. Ghani (2012) argued that trade liberalization may have an effect on energy
consumption, because it induces changes in trade policies that are related to energy usage, such
as reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers on energy efficient products. Liberalization may also
influence energy consumption indirectly through changes in economic growth, environmental
regulations, implementation of ecologically beneficial management practices, reallocation of
resources, etc. It is also anticipated that liberalization brings about institutional changes, which
affects the transfer of energy-saving technologies that can help to improve energy efficiency.
3

Trade liberalization may also induce the technique effect indirectly through the increase in
income. Higher income is believed to change consumer preferences, inducing the government to
reform environmental and energy regulations. Similarly, in another recent study, Sadorsky
(2012) explained how export and imports are linked to energy consumption. Export expansion
increases the demand for the factors of production (capital, labor, energy) used to make the
exports. Once exports are produced, machinery and equipments must be used to load and
transport the exports to seaports, airports or other docking stations where the exports are then
offloaded and re-loaded for voyages abroad. The machinery and equipments used in the
production, processing and transportation of goods for export require energy to operate. An
increase in exports represents an increase in economic activities in export oriented sectors and
this should increase the demand for energy. Likewise, imported goods can affect the demands for
energy in two ways. Firstly, imports are trade flows into a country and this necessitates a well
functioned transportation network to move goods around, which requires energy. As a
consequence, an increase in trade flows is expected to increase energy consumption. Secondly,
the composition of imports can affect energy consumption especially if the imports are energy
intensive products like automobiles, dishwashers, air conditioners, etc. It is also possible that
energy consumption can affect the flow of imported goods if the imported goods are machinery
or equipments that require energy to operate. Energy conservation policies or lack of accessible
energy may reduce the usefulness and efficiency of energy-dependent imported goods, making it
less likely that such goods will be imported. In both cases, there is also a possibility of a
feedback relationship or no statistically significant relationship between imports and energy, and
export and energy.
The empirical studies, however, demonstrated inconclusive results on the relationship
between trade openness and energy consumption. According to the Narayan and Smyth (2009)
for a panel of six Middle-Eastern countries (Iran, Israel, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Syria)
showed short-run Granger causality running from electricity consumption to real GDP and from
income to exports. They also found evidence in favor of a long-run Granger causality
relationship running from exports and electricity consumption to real income earned from
exports and real income to electricity consumption.
In two research papers on almost the similar topic, studying electricity generation and
consumption in Malaysia, Lean and Smyth (2010a) found evidence for Granger causality
running from electricity generation to exports; however, Lean and Smyth (2010b) did not find
any evidence for a Granger causal relationship between exports and electricity consumption.
While Lean and Smyth (2010a, 2010b) and Narayan and Smyth (2009) focused on the
relationship between exports and electricity, Sadorsky (2011) focussed on the more general
relationship between energy consumption and trade (measured by either exports or imports).
Sadorsky (2011) for a panel of Middle-Eastern economies (Bahrain, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, and United Arab Emirates) found that short-run dynamics show causality
running from exports to energy consumption and a feedback relationship between imports and
energy consumption. In case of Pakistan, Shahbaz et al. (2013) investigated the relationship
between natural gas consumption and economic growth by incorporating exports in the
production function. Their results indicated that the variables are integrated for a long run
relationship. Natural gas consumption, exports, capital and labour add in economic growth.
Natural gas consumption Granger causes economic growth and exports.
Several studies have been conducted recently considering the technique effect, laborcapital composition effect and urbanization effect to determine the energy demands in an
4

economy. Utilizing the theoretical model of Antweiler et al. (2001), Cole (2006) has modelled
empirically the mechanisms through which trade liberalization affected the pattern of national
energy consumption on 32 developed and developing countries. The results of this study suggest
that per capita energy consumption is subject to a scale effect which, for the mean country,
outweighs the negative technique effect, indicating that regulations and technological
improvements are not keeping pace with the growth of GNP. With regard to the trade-induced
composition effect, evidences have been found to suggest that energy-intensive industries are
subject to conflicting forces as postulated by the factor endowment and the pollution haven
hypotheses. These results indicate that trade liberalization and per capita energy consumption
have a positive correlation. Working on the annual data from 1971 to 2007, Hossain (2011)
empirically examined the dynamic causal relationships between CO2 emission, energy
consumption, economic growth, trade openness and urbanization for a panel of nine newly
industrialized countries. The results of the study have supported the hypothesis that there is no
evidence for long-run causal relationship, but there is a unidirectional short-run causal
relationship from economic growth and trade openness to CO2 emission, from economic growth
in energy consumption, from trade openness to economic growth, from urbanization to economic
growth and from trade openness to urbanization. These results support the study of Sadorsky
(2011) on eight Middle-Eastern countries for the period of 1980 to 2007, showing short-run
causality from exports to energy consumption, and a bi-directional feedback relationship
between imports and energy consumption.
Studying in seven South American countries for the period of 1980 to 2007, Sadorsky
(2012) showed a short-run bi-directional feedback relationship between energy consumption and
exports, output and exports and output and imports. Evidences also suggest that there is a one
way short-run relationship from energy consumption to imports. In the long-run, a causal
relationship has been established between trade (exports or imports) and energy consumption.
Ghani (2012), working in 54 developing countries, showed that trade liberalization per se does
not affect the growth of energy consumption of the developing countries, but its interaction with
capital per labor reduces the growth of energy consumption as capital per labor increases.
However, the effect is only significant after a certain minimum threshold level capital per labor
is reached. On the other hand, economic growth increases energy consumption and its effect is
not conditional upon trade liberalization.
Based on these mixed empirical findings, this paper tries to determine the impacts of
trade openness, economic growth, technique effects, labor-capital composition, and urbanization
on the energy consumption in Malaysia. Malaysia, an important economic player in East Asia,
has successfully pursued a policy of robust economic growth enviable for any emerging nation.
However, a significant spurt in energy consumption followed by a concomitant rise in pollutant
emissions in recent times has made the choice of the study for this country not only timely but
also of much significance. According to the United Nations Development Report, CO2 emission
in Malaysia has increased by 221% in 2004 compared to the emission level of 1990. The report
lists Malaysia at 26th among the top 30 greenhouse gas emitting nations. If the current rate of
emission persists and other top greenhouse gas emitters improve their energy consumption
efficiency, Malaysia may move up the ladder. The fact that Malaysia is a signatory to Kyoto
Protocol did little to alter the pattern of the rapid growth in emissions (Liebman, 2007).
However, the several initiatives taken by the government to promote renewable energy and to
reduce CO2 emission are reassuring. Therefore, the findings of the energy demand model will
help policymakers choose appropriate strategies for sustainable economic growth in Malaysia.
5

Recent study by, Islam et al. (2013) working in Malaysia suggested that energy consumption is
influenced by economic growth and financial development, both in short-run and long-run, but
the population-energy relationship holds only in the long run1.
III. Data, Model Construction and Estimation Strategy
The data on energy consumption per capita (kt of oil equivalent), CO2 emissions per capita
(metric tons per capita), real capital stock, real trade (exports + imports), labor force, urbanizing
population as share of total population has been obtained from world development indicators
(CD-ROM, 2012). The present study has covered the time period of 1970-2011. We have used
series of population to transform the data into per capita. The series are converted into a natural
log form.
We follow Cole, (2006); Kneller et al. (2008); Ghani, (2011, 2012) to examine the impact
of trade openness on energy demand using quarter frequency data over the period of 1970-2011
in the case of Malaysia. The empirical equation is modeled as following:

Et  f (Yt , Yt 2 , KLt , TRt ,U t )

(1)

We apply log-linear model2. Our empirical model is articulated as follows:

ln Et  1   2 ln Yt   3 ln Yt 2   4 ln KLt   5 ln TRt   6 ln U t  t

(2)

Where, ln Et , ln Yt , ln Yt 2 , ln KLt , ln TRt and ln U t is natural log of energy consumption
per capita, real GDP per capita, real GDP per capita square, capital-labor ratio per capita, trade
openness (exports + imports) per capita and urbanisation per capita. Yt indicates economic
growth effect, scale and technique effect is captured by Yt 2 , KLt represents composite effect,
trade openness is shown by TRt , urbanisation effect is indicated by U t and Et is for energy use .
 t is error term expected to be independently identically distributed. We expected that ln Yt > 0,

ln Yt 2 < 0, ln K t .Lt > 0, ln TRt > 0 and ln U t < 0.
II.I Zivot-Adndrews Unit Root Test
Historically, in order to test stationarity properties of the variables unit root tests like
ADF by Dickey and Fuller (1979), P-P by Philips and Perron (1988), KPSS by Kwiatkowski et
al. (1992), DF-GLS by Elliott et al. (1996) and Ng-Perron by Ng-Perron (2001) have been used
extensively. However, due to lack of information on structural breaks stemming in the series,
these tests produce unreliable results. To remove this anomaly Zivot and Adndrews, (1992)
suggested another model that allows to accommodate single structural break point in the
variables at level form, in slope of trend component, and in intercept and trend function. Using
Zivot-Andrews, (1992) model the structural break in the series can be tested as:

The null hypothesis of unit root break date is c  0 which indicates that series is not
stationary with a drift not having information about structural break stemming in the series while
c  0 hypothesis implies that the variable is found to be trend-stationary with one unknown time
break. Zivot-Andrews unit root test fixes all points as potential for possible time break and does
estimation through regression for all possible structural breaks successively. Then, this unit root
test selects that time break which decreases one-sided t-statistic to test cˆ( c  1)  1 . ZivotAndrews intimate that in the presence of end points, asymptotic distribution of the statistics is
diverged to infinity point. It is necessary to choose a region where the end points of sample
period are excluded. Further, Zivot-Andrews suggested the trimming regions i.e. (0.15T, 0.85T)
are followed.
II.II The ARDL Bounds Testing Approach
Since traditional approaches to cointegration have certain demerits, we have used the
structural break autoregressive distributed lag model or the ARDL bounds testing approach to
cointegration in the presence of structural break stemming in the series. The ARDL bounds
testing approach to cointegration has certain merits like it is flexible regarding integrating order
of the variables whether variables are found to be stationary at I(1) or I(0) or I(1) / I(0). In
addition, Monte Carlo investigation confirms that this approach is better suited for small sample
size (Pesaran and Shin, 1999). Moreover, a dynamic unrestricted error correction model (UECM)
can be derived from the ARDL bounds testing through a simple linear transformation. The
UECM integrates the short run dynamics with the long run equilibrium without losing any
information for the long run. The empirical formulation of the ARDL bounds testing approach to
cointegration is given below:

 ln Et  1   T T   E ln E   Y ln Yt 1   Y 2 ln Yt 21   K / L ln KLt 1   TR ln TRt 1

Where, ln Et , ln Yt , ln K / Lt , ln TRt and ln U t labortes natural log of energy consumption,
natural log of real GDP per urbanizationral log of capital-labour ratio, natural log of trade
openness per capita and natural log of urbanisation per capita.  is for difference operator and
 t denotes residual term. F-statistics are computed to compare with upper and lower critical
bounds generated by Pesaran et al. (2001) to test for existence of cointegration. The null
hypothesis to examine the existence of the long run relationship between the variables is
H 0 :  E   Y   K / L   TR  U  0 against alternate hypothesis ( H a :  E   Y   K / L   TR  U  0 ) of
cointegration for equation-4. Using Pesaran et al. (2001) critical bounds, if computed F-statistic
is more than upper critical bound (UCB) there is cointegration between the variables. If
computed F-statistic does not exceed lower critical bound (LCB) the variables are not
cointegrated for a long run relationship. If computed F-statistic falls between lower and upper
critical bounds then decisions regarding cointegration between the variables is uncertain.
However, since our sample size is large (160 observations) and critical bounds generated by
Pesaran et al. (2001) may be suitable. Therefore, we use lower and upper critical bounds
developed by Pesaran et al. (2001) rather than Narayan (2005).
II.III The VECM Granger Causality Approach
We should apply the vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the causal relationship
between the variables once cointegration relationship exists between the series. It is argued by
Granger, (1987) that the VECM is an appropriate approach to examine causality between the
variables when series are integrated at I(1). The empirical equation of the VECM Granger
causality approach is modelled as follows:

Where (1  L) indicates difference operator and lagged residual term is indicated by ECTt-1 which
is obtained from long run relationship while 1t ,  2t ,  3t ,  4t , and  5t are error terms. These terms
are supposed to be homoscedastic i.e. constant variance. The statistical significance of the
coefficient of lagged error term i.e. ECTt 1 usithe long run causal relationshipn causal
relationship between the variables. The short run causality is shown by statistical significance of
F-statistic using Wald-test by incorporating differences and lagged differences of independent
variables in the model. Moreover, the joint significance of the lagged error term with differences
and lagged differences of independent variables provides joint long-and-short runs causality. For
example, b12,i  0i implies that economic growth Granger-causes CO2 emissions per capita and
economic growth is Granger cause of CO2 emissions per capita shown by b21,i  0i .
IV. Results and their Discussions
The primary step is to test the unit root properties of the variables to proceed for the ARDL
bounds testing approach to cointegration. The ARDL bounds testing approach is free from preunit root testing but we ensure that none of the variables is integrated at I (2). The bounds testing
assumes that variables should be stationary at I(0) or I(1) or I(0)/I(1). So to overcome this issue,
we have applied traditional unit root tests such as ADF test by Dickey and Fuller (1981), PP test
by Philips and Perron (1981) and DF-GLS test by Elliott et al. (1996). The results of these unit
root tests are reported in Table-1. The results show that energy consumption, income, capitallabor ratio, trade openness and urbanization have a unit root problem at level with intercept and
trend. This series is found to be stationary at 1st difference. This shows that the variables have
unique order of integration.

These unit root tests may provide misleading results regarding stationary properties of the
variables. The reason is that these unit root tests do provide information about structural breaks
arising in the series. The information about structural breaks in the series would enable policy
makers to analyze the impact of major economic policies and help them in articulating a
comprehensive economic, energy as trade policy to sustain long run economic growth. The issue
is resolved by applying Z-A unit root test which accommodates information about one unknown
structural break occurring in the series. The results of Z-A unit root test are pasted in Table-2.
The results disclose that variables are non-stationary at level but integrated at order 1 i.e. I(1).
This exposes that we should apply the ARDL bounds test approach to examine long run
association between the variables.

According to the ARDL approach, lag order of the variables is important for the model
specification. Table-3 indicated the lag length criterion. In this paper, we followed Akaike
information criteria to select an appropriate lag length. It is pointed by Lütkepohl, (2006) that
AIC has superior power properties for small sample data compared to any lag length criterion.
Akaike information criterion provides efficient and consistent results as compared to final
prediction error (FPE), Schwarz information criterion (SBC) and Hannan-Quinn information
criterion (HQ). Based on empirical evidence provided by AIC, we find that the optimum lag is 6
in such quarter frequency data over the period of 1970-2011 in the case of Malaysia.

The results of bounds testing are detailed in Table-4. Our empirical evidence opines that
the calculated F-statistic exceeds the upper critical bound at the 5% level of significance. This
11

concludes that we may reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration. The results reported on
Table-4 show that there is evidence of cointegration once we treated income, factor endowment,
trade openness and urbanization as predictor variables. This shows that there exists a long run
relationship between trade openness and energy consumption in the case of Malaysia over the
period of 1970-2011.
Log run model fulfills the assumptions of the classical linear regression model (CLRM)
such as serial correlation, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity as well as white
heteroskedasticity and specification of the model. Our results find that evidence of no serial
correlation is found. The autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity and white
heteroskedasticity are not found. Finally, the bounds testing model is articulated well as
confirmed by Ramsey RESET tests.
The next turn is to find the impact of independent actors on the dependent variable. The
results show that income has a positive impact on energy consumption. This shows that income
effect is more elastic for energy consumption and it is statistically significant at the 1% level of
significance. A 1% increase in income is linked with 1.9980% energy consumption. Due to the
vision 2020 to become a developed nation, the Malaysian economy is growing very fast. Like
other developed countries, the consumption patterns of people are moving more towards the
technological usage. Moreover, better financial growth and credit facilities are leading to more
use of energy. Further, due to the high subsidy and lower price of fuel, people tend to use more
vehicles and household machineries. Therefore, energy reduction policies will have less impact
on economic growth here.
The impact of scale and technique effect on energy consumption is negative and
significant at 5% significance level. This implies that economies of scale and adoption of
advanced technology saves energy by 0.3036%. Therefore, energy consumption policies should
be driven based on the adoption of advanced technologies and achieving economies of scales,
especially in the industrial and manufacturing production level. The impact of capital-labor ratio
(composite effect) has a positive impact on energy demand and it is statistically significant at the
10% level of significance. It implies that keeping other things constant, a 1% increase in capitallabor ratio is linked with energy use by 0.0474%. Due to this highly inelastic nature of a
composite effect on energy demand, emphasizing on the usage of more capital in terms of labor
or capital intensive production will lead to a very low increase of energy usage. Based on the
technique and composition effects, Malaysia should increase and focus more on advanced energy
saving technologies to control its high usage of energy.
The positive and statistically relationship is found between trade openness and energy
consumption. We find that a 0.0617% increase in energy consumption is related to 1% increase
in trade openness, all else is same. Generally, in a low-income country an increase in trade
openness will increase their energy usage, but in a high-income country energy usage falls in
response to trade liberalization. As Malaysia is a growing economy, the energy consumption
shows an inelastic nature in response to trade openness. Therefore, emphasizing on more
openness in trade will lead to very low level of increase in energy usage. Thus, trade expansion
policies like export promotion policies designed to increase exports will not increase energy
consumption here. Another implication of the findings is that environmental policies that reduce
energy consumption will not affect the growth in exports. The impact of urbanization on energy
consumption is positive and significant at 1% significance level. We infer that a 1% urbanization
raises energy demand by 0.8188% by keeping other things constant. Due to the vision 2020 to
become a developed nation, the countryside is growing rapidly with the urban facilities. At the
12

same time, infrastructural advancement causes the expansion of urban areas. The growing
income facilities in rural areas are also leading to more use of technology. Eventually, the
urbanization effect causes an increase in the energy consumption in the Malaysian society.

The short run results are also reported in the lower segment of Table-5. The results opine
that future energy demand is positively affected by energy demand in the current period at 1%
13

level of significance. Economic growth declines but the scale and technique increase energy
consumption. These findings are statistically significant at the 1% level of significance. The
capital-labor ratio has positive and statistically significant impact on energy demand. Trade
openness declines energy consumption. Urbanization is also positively linked with energy
consumption but it is statistically insignificant. The long run relations between openness and
energy consumption established through the lagged error correction term which is negative and
significant. The negative sign of the error correction term confirms the expected convergence
process in the long-run dynamics of openness and energy consumption in Malaysia. In fact, 18
percent of the last year’s disequilibria are corrected in the current year based on these results,
suggesting a speed of adjustment in the relationship process following a shock. In order to
achieve the stable long run equilibrium energy demand in Malaysia, it would take around five
years and two quarters. The results of the diagnostic tests suggest that the underlying desirable
assumptions are fulfilled. The short run findings of the empirical results are consistent in order to
implement the carbon emissions or environmental policy in Malaysia.
The stability of the ARDL bounds testing estimates is investigated by applying the
CUSUM and CUSUMsq tests. The results are shown in Figure-1 and 2. The plots of the CUSUM
statistics are well within the critical bounds.

The plots of the CUSUMsq of squares statistics are not well within the critical bounds.
Furthermore, we apply Chow forecast test to examine the significance structural breaks in an
economy for the period 1983-1984 due to industrialization in terms of consumer goods and
restrictive trade policy. In this study, F-statistics computed in Table-6 suggests that there is no
significant structural break in the economy during the sample period. The chow forecast test is
more reliable and preferable than graphs (Leow, 2004). This confirms that the ARDL estimates
are reliable and efficient.
Conclusion and Policy Implications
Trade liberalization policies reduce or remove the tariff and non-tariff barriers in order to allow
the exchange of goods and services without any barriers. In order to implementation of trade
liberalization policy in the emerging and industrialized countries, it will attract foreign direct
investment that accelerates economic growth through the creating the employment opportunities,
transfer technology and improve the welfare in the country. In these processes, there are two
types of gains from trade such as static and dynamic. Trade liberalization process helps to create
a more competitive market through the reduction of cost due to economies of scale and
efficiency. This process is known as the static gains from trade. On the other hand dynamic gains
from trade are the transfer and adoption of better management practices and energy-efficient
technologies. Trade openness consists of both exports and imports activities can influence the
economic growth through the primary inputs in the production process such as energy. Exportsoriented countries will increase the demand for energy utilization for machineries, equipments
and transportation of the exports-oriented products. The technology based energy intensive
imported products like television, computer, automobile, air-conditioner and washing machines
are increasing the demand for energy. According to the endogenous growth theory, imports-trade
can be a potential channel to influence the economic growth by transferring technology and
factors of production. This implies that trade openness enhances energy consumption via exports,
imports and foreign direct investment (adoption of advanced energy-efficient technology) etc.
This paper investigated the how much energy demand is affected by trade openness by
incorporating economic growth and urbanization in energy demand function in case of Malaysia.
Theoretically trade openness affects energy consumption the scale, composition and technique
effects influence the growth of energy consumption. We applied the ARDL bounds approach to
examine the long run relationship between the variables while dummy variable is included to
capture the structural break arising in the series. Our results exposed that in the presence of
structural breaks, cointegration exists between the variables. The findings unveiled that income
and scale effects have a positive and negative impact on energy demand. The composition of
factor of production also adds in energy consumption. Trade openness raises energy demand. A
positive relationship from urbanization to energy consumption is found. In the short run, trade
openness declines energy consumption and urbanization increases energy demand but it is
statistically insignificant.
The Malaysian economy is growing very fast with the vision of a developed nation by 2020.
Here economic growth will have high impacts on energy consumption due to more elastic
relationship from income to energy consumption. However, due to the inelastic nature of energy
15

consumption in response to trade openness, emphasizing on more openness in trade will lead to
very low level of increase in energy usage. Thus, trade expansion policies like export promotion
policies designed to increase exports will not increase energy consumption. Therefore, this paper
suggests that in Malaysia the energy consumption policies should be driven based on the
adoption of advanced energy saving technologies and achieving economies of scales, especially
in the industrial and manufacturing production level.
