Wealth and Obesity Among U.S. Adults Entering Midlife
Joseph D. Wolfe1, Elizabeth H. Baker1, Isabel C. Scarinci2

Objective: This study examines the relationship between wealth and obesity among adults entering
midlife and whether this relationship varies by gender, race, and measure of wealth.
Methods: The data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79).
Population-averaged models were used to examine the associations between multiple measures of wealth
and obesity among 6,979 respondents while controlling for education, occupation, income, and relevant
sociodemographic variables.
Results: The analysis found a robust association between wealth and midlife obesity as well as
heterogeneity in the wealth-obesity association across gender, race, and measure of wealth. With the
exception of Black men, net worth generally had a significant and inverse relationship with obesity. The
net worth-obesity association was largest among women and was driven primarily by home value—in
addition to savings and debt for Black women. Although home value was significant for White men, the
components of wealth were generally unrelated to obesity among men.
Conclusions: The association between wealth can obesity was generally robust but also complex,
depending on gender, race, and measure of wealth. Research that does not consider multiple components
of wealth may overlook the importance of economic resources in shaping obesity rates in the U.S.
population.

INTRODUCTION
Our current understanding of the relationship between
socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity is largely
based on education, occupation, and income, but for
those entering middle adulthood (45 to 65 years old),
wealth is a key indicator of SES and a correlate of
health and obesity (1–4). Hajat et al. (1), for example,
found that those in the lowest quintiles of wealth in
their sample had a 40 to 89 percent higher risk of
becoming obese than those in the highest quintiles.
Although this growing area of research provides strong
evidence of wealth-based disparities, we do not know
whether different types of wealth are differentially
related to obesity. To address this gap, this study
examines the associations between multiple measures
of wealth (i.e., total net worth, home value, vehicle
value, savings, investments, and debt) and obesity
using a nationally representative and longitudinal
sample of adults during their transition into midlife.
Health disparities scholarship typically defines wealth
as net worth. Net worth is a combination of five major
components of wealth in the U.S., including the total
value of one’s home, automotive vehicles, savings, and
investments minus the total value of one’s debts. These
components of wealth represent distinct material
resources (5), and as such, they may have independent
associations with obesity. Furthermore, research
generally finds an inverse relationship between SES
and obesity for women, but for men—Black men in
particular—past research has found a null or even
positive relationship (6–9). But these studies do not
consider multiple sources of wealth, which vary
considerably by gender and race. In our discussion
below, we review these components of wealth in more
detail and explain why each component has a potential
social, behavioral, or psychological connection with
obesity.
Housing wealth is the largest contributor to net worth
and grows as a financial resource in midlife (4, 10).
With respect to obesity, prior research has found that
obesogenic environments (e.g., areas perceived as

proximate to crime, heavy traffic, liquor stores, and
fast food) are associated with lower property values,
and property values are negatively associated with
obesity and BMI (11–13). Rehm et al. (13) examined
the assessed value of homes in a Washington county
and found that women with property in the bottom
quartile were 3.4 times more likely to experience
obesity than women in the top quartile. Thus, prior
research suggests that the value of one’s home should
be inversely related to midlife obesity.
Savings represent the most flexible source of wealth
and may relate to obesity in a few ways. Savings can
help in times of emergencies, e.g., illness or short-term
unemployment, and thus reduce the stress and longterm, financial impact of these difficulties (14). The
amount an individual has in their savings and checking
accounts also provides information on individuals’
excess money available to offset weight gain in later
adulthood by purchasing, e.g., a gym membership or
personal trainer. Savings may also represent
unobserved, non-cognitive human capital with respect
to self-control and future-oriented action (15), which
are inversely related to healthy lifestyles and obesity
(16).
Although investments can offer an additional source of
income, their relationship with health and health
behaviors is complicated. On one hand, stock owners
during stock booms experience an improvement in
their general physical and mental health and a
reduction in blood pressure and heart disease (17). On
the other hand, stock market crashes are associated
with poorer mental health, increased hospital
admissions related to psychological conditions, and
risky health behaviors like binge drinking for those
with investments (18, 19). Thus, investments may
create a unique set of vulnerabilities and resiliencies
with respect to obesity, especially for those who
experienced the Great Recession of 2007 (3).
The value of one’s car may provide further information
on one’s financial standing and social status beyond

Wealth and Obesity Wolfe, Baker, and Scarinci
what other components of net worth capture,
especially for Black women and men. Although
housing wealth is typically the most valuable asset of
White households, almost all of the median wealth of
single Black women can be attributed to their vehicles
(20, 21). Thus, although cars represent a depreciating
asset with fewer financial benefits than home
ownership, vehicle wealth may still provide a useful
indicator of SES.
Contrary to other components of wealth, debt is an
emotionally stressful experience that has become a
common occurrence over the course of the last twenty
years due to increases in foreclosures, credit card
overspending, and student loans (22, 23). For example,
after adjusting for education and income, Münster et
al. (24) found that debt increases the odds of obesity
by a factor of 2.5. Thus, debt may provide additional
insights into the relationship between obesity and
financial insecurity in midlife for those with an
absence of wealth (22).
METHODS
Participants
The data come from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79). The NLSY-79 is an
ongoing longitudinal survey conducted by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics. It began with a nationally
representative sample of 12,686 U.S. women and men
in 1979 (25). The survey still occurs biennially and
includes information related to BMI, educational
degrees, occupation, income, wealth, and other
important covariates of obesity such as geographic
residence and marital status.
When the NLSY-79 began in 1979, respondents
ranged in age from 14 to 22 years old, but because our
focus is on obesity among adults transitioning into
midlife, we used the 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012
survey waves. These waves include respondents
ranging in age from 31 to 39 years old in the 1996 to
47 to 55 years old in the 2012 survey. The NLSY-79

did not ask questions about respondents’ wealth in the
1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010 surveys.
We limited our analysis to non-Hispanic, White and
Black respondents because of the limited number of
Hispanic respondents, the characteristics of the
Hispanic sample, and our interest in Black-White
differences. The NLSY-79’s cohort was taken prior to
the large influx of Mexican migrants experienced in
the 1980’s through 2000’s who make up
approximately 63% of the Hispanic population (26).
Thus, the NLSY-79’s cohort of Hispanics does not
provide an accurate representation of the current
Hispanic population in the U.S.
Obesity
The NLSY-79 contains multiple measures of
respondents’ self-reported height and weight between
1981 and 2014. We used respondents most recently
reported height and weight to create binary indicators
of obesity (BMI ≥ 30) for each wave in the analysis
sample. While measured height and weight are
preferable, research indicates that self-reports are a
reasonable proxy for measured height and weight (27).
The BMI of women who were pregnant during the
survey was set to missing.
Wealth
The NLSY-79 contains information on the value of
homes; savings, stocks, investments, and bonds;
businesses and farms; and vehicles in addition to
money owed on real estate and vehicles and debts
related to homes, cars, businesses and other lines of
credit. Using this information, we created measures of
total net worth and the five major components of
wealth, including 1) the market value of respondent’s
home or apartment; 2) the market value of vehicles; 3)
the total value of savings and checking; 4) whether the
respondent had any stocks, bonds, or other
investments; and 5) whether the respondent was in
debt (28). In the analysis, net worth, house value, car
value, and savings/checking were operationalized as
1

Wealth and Obesity Wolfe, Baker, and Scarinci
quartiles in order to address their non-normal
distribution and to test for non-linear associations
between wealth and obesity. Only a limited number of
respondents had investments or debts. Thus, we
operationalized debt as a binary variable indicating
respondents with a negative total net worth, and we
operationalized investments as a binary variable
indicating whether respondents had any investments.

ranging from 0 to 3 (alpha = .80). SES has a strong
relationship with health behaviors like smoking and
physical activity, which are also correlated with BMI
(30). Thus, all statistical models controlled for whether
respondents were daily smokers at the time of the
survey (yes=1) and whether they engaged in three or
more days each week of vigorous physical exercise or
sports, e.g., aerobics, running, swimming, or bicycling
(yes=1).

Controls
All statistical models included controls for several
other indicators of SES, including income, education,
and occupation. Income was measured using the log of
yearly family income. Education was measured as
educational degrees, including categories for no
degree, high school degree, associate degree, bachelor’
degree, and graduate degree. Occupation is measured
as a categorical variable with three categories
identifying respondents who were not working,
respondents who had white-collar occupations
(managerial and professional), and respondents who
had blue- or pink-collar occupations (private
household, service, operators, transportation, laborers,
technical and related support, sales, administrative
support, and protective services).
Several confounding factors may explain the
association between wealth and obesity, including
health limitations, depression, and health behaviors.
Health limitations were operationalized as a binary
indicator of health problems that 1) inhibit
respondents’ ability to work or 2) limit the amount or
kind of work they can do. The analysis also controlled
for depression because of its association with SES and
BMI (29). The NLSY-79 collected a 7-item version of
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) in the 1994 survey wave (25). Items included
questions such as, e.g., whether respondents felt sad or
depressed or could not get “going.” Respondents
answers could range from 0, rarely or none of the time
(less than 1 day), to 3, most or all of the time (5 to 7
days). We calculated an average of these items for each
respondent in order to create a depression score

Statistical models also controlled for several
sociodemographic correlates of SES and obesity,
including time-varying variables for age, urban
residence, southern residence, and marital status. The
NLSY-79 collects information on urbanicity and
geographic region of each respondent’s residence at
the time of interview. A respondent is generally coded
as urban if they lived in an area that the U.S. Census
identified as an urbanized area or urban cluster. The
NLSY-1979 also collects region of current residence
(i.e., Northeast, North Central, South, or West). The
analysis controlled for a binary indicator of living in
the South (yes=1) because the majority of geographic
variation in obesity tends to be between southern and
non-southern (Northeast, North Central, or West)
regions (6). Finally, marital status is operationalized as
three
categories:
married,
divorced/separated/widowed, and never married.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
A major strength of the NLSY-79 data is its
longitudinal design, but multiple observations create
time series dependencies. To address this issue, we
took a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE)
approach and estimated a series of PA models for
binary outcomes using Stata’s xtlogit command (31).
The most notable advantage is that PA models address
non-independence in the data while also avoiding
problematic assumptions that other longitudinal
methods make (32, 33). Because the repeated
observations of obesity have a natural order, we
assumed the correlation structure is a first order
autoregressive process. Because GEE is not likelihood
2

Wealth and Obesity Wolfe, Baker, and Scarinci
based, we used the Quasi-likelihood Information
Criterion (QICu), a modification of Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC), to compare model fit (33,
34). Smaller values of the QICu statistic indicate a
better fit.
Gender and race likely moderate the relationship
between components of wealth and obesity. Research
has generally found an inverse relationship between
SES and obesity for women, but for men this
relationship is less consistent, especially among Black
men (6–9). Thus, we began the analysis with models
of obesity that included the total sample, and then we
considered models stratified by gender and race.
We took several precautions to ensure that missing
data did not meaningfully affect results. First, we
imputed missing data using chained equations (31, 35).
Next, we conducted diagnostic tests to check whether
imputed values were similar to the distributions of the
original variables (36). Finally, we estimated models
after listwise deletion. Results from models after
listwise deletion suggested the same substantive
conclusions we present here.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the means of continuous variables and
the proportions of each category in categorical
variables. These descriptive statistics use the 2004
survey, the median survey year in the analysis, and
values are based on 20 imputed datasets. Ages ranged
between 39 to 47 in 2004. Total net worth, home value,
car value, savings/checking, and income are presented
in 2018 dollars and in units of 10,000. In the analysis,
wealth and its components are converted to quartiles to
address their non-normal distributions and to reveal
any non-linear associations with obesity.
-- Table 1 about here -Table 2 contains results from PA models predicting
obesity with different measures of wealth. Models 1
through 7 included interactions between gender and

race and controls for educational attainment,
occupation, log income, and other control variables
(controls are not shown; see Table A1 in the appendix
for complete models). In Model 1, we found
significant race, gender, and wealth differences in the
odds of obesity. Black women had significantly higher
odds than white men (95% CI = 1.54, 2.18), whereas
White women had significantly lower odds than White
men (95% CI = 0.77, 0.97). Those in the third and
fourth quartiles of net worth had significantly lower
odds of obesity than the first quartile (95% CI = 0.77,
0.94 for Q3 and 95% CI = 0.61, 0.77 for Q4).
For Models 2 through 7 in Table 2, we disaggregated
net worth into its components: housing wealth, car
value, savings/checking, investments, and debt. We
found that Model 7, which contains all five
components of net worth, was the best fitting (QICu =
7,068). In this model, we found that being in the fourth
quartile of housing wealth and savings was
significantly related to a reduction in the odds of
obesity, whereas debt was significantly associated
with an increase in the odds of obesity. We also found
a non-linear association between savings and obesity
in which the second quartile is related to a higher odds
ratio of obesity (95% CI = 1.10, 1.27) than the first,
third, and fourth quartiles.
-- Table 2 about here -Figure 1 displays predicted probabilities of obesity
based on the results of PA models in Table 2. Figure 1
provides a visualization of the differences in
magnitude of the wealth-obesity associations. The
highest quartiles of total net worth have the smallest
predicted probability of obesity. Although debt is
related to a significantly larger probability of obesity,
the difference in probabilities between those with and
without debt is relatively small when compared to the
differences in the probability of obesity for quartiles of
net worth, home value, and savings.
-- Figure 1 about here -3

Wealth and Obesity Wolfe, Baker, and Scarinci
Table 3 contains results from models stratified by
gender and race. Even after controlling for education,
occupation, income, and sociodemographic variables
(see Table A2 in the appendix for complete models),
we found that Black and White women and White men
in the fourth quartiles of total net worth had
significantly lower odds of obesity than those in the
first quartile of net worth (95% CI = 0.42, 0.72 for
Black women; 95% CI = 0.44, 0.65 for White women;
and 95% CI = 0.60, 0.96 for White men). A few
notable race and gender differences emerged when we
examined components of wealth in Models 2, 4, 6, and
8. First, debt had a positive association with obesity for
Black women in Model 2 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.50). Home
value was significantly related to lower obesity for
White women in Model 4 (95% CI = 0.59, 0.88) and
White men in Model 8 (95% CI = 0.65, 0.92).
Another notable result is that some forms of wealth had
a positive association with obesity—but only for
women and Black men. For example, both Black and
White women in the second quartile of savings had a
significantly higher odds ratio of obesity than Black
and White women in the first quartile of savings (95%
CI = 1.02, 1.33 for Black women and 95% CI = 1.12,
1.52 for White women). For Black men, the third
quartile of car value was associated with a higher odds
ratio of obesity (95% CI = 1.07, 1.63). Related, the
QICu statistic suggests that models of obesity using the
components of wealth are generally a better fit for all
social group—with one notable exception; for Black
men, the QICu suggests that the components model is
a poorer fit than the net worth model. Taken together,
significance tests and the QICu statistic suggest that
neither net worth nor its components have a
meaningful relationship with obesity among Black
men.
-- Table 3 about here -Figure 2 highlights the heterogeneity in the magnitude
of the wealth-obesity associations across components

and social groups. Net worth and obesity had a larger
association among Black and White women. Housing
wealth appears to be the key component driving the
overall net worth-obesity relationship for White
women and men, whereas savings and debt appear to
be more important for Black women. For both Black
and White men, the probability of obesity is relatively
similar to the overall proportion of obesity for each
group and relatively stable across quartiles of wealth
and its components.
-- Figure 2 about here -DISCUSSION
To extend the growing body of health disparities
research on wealth, we examined the relationship
between obesity and five major components of wealth,
including housing wealth, savings, investments,
automotive vehicle wealth, and debt. Results from the
analysis provided evidence that multiple components
of wealth are significantly associated with obesity, but
the nature and magnitude of these associations varied
considerably by one’s gender, race, and source of
wealth. We review these results and their implications
in more detail below.
With the exception of Black men, net worth had a
significant and inverse relationship with obesity. In
models that were not stratified by gender and race, the
two highest quartiles of net worth had the lowest odds
of obesity. In models that were stratified by gender and
race, the association between net worth and obesity
was largest for women but had notable racial
differences. For Black women, those in the highest
quartile of net worth had a significantly lower
probability of obesity than women in every other
quartile, whereas for White women, both the third and
fourth quartiles had relatively low predicted
probabilities of obesity. We also found a significant
association between net worth and obesity for White
men, but the association was relatively small when
compared to the results for Black and White women.
Thus, for Black and White women and White men, our
4

Wealth and Obesity Wolfe, Baker, and Scarinci
results suggest that wealth provides additional
information on the relationship between SES and
obesity beyond what education, occupation, and
income provide (1).
A more complex picture of the wealth-obesity
relationship emerged when we disaggregated net
worth into its components. Housing wealth had a
particularly large association with obesity for White
women and men. While this result supports research
on obesogenic environments and property value (12,
37), we found little evidence of a similar association
between housing wealth and obesity among Black
women and men. This finding could be the result of
discriminatory practices at multiple stages of
purchasing a home that constrain Black families from
moving into more desirable—and less obesogenic—
neighborhoods (10, 12). Thus, future research should
extend this study by considering how residential
quality and racial segregation moderate the
relationship between housing wealth and obesity.
Being in debt was positively associated with a higher
probability of obesity among Black women, and this
relationship remained significant even after
controlling for housing wealth (an important control
given that mortgages tend to make up a significant
portion of debt). This finding, along with the null
finding of housing wealth, provides evidence that the
wealth-obesity relationship among Black women may
be due more to stress than the obesogenic qualities of
low-income neighborhoods. Household debt is
common among minority communities, who are often
the victims of predatory lending (38), and debt among
minorities is associated with higher levels of stress and
depression (19). Although this association is relatively
small in magnitude, it is still pertinent given the
increasing concerns about the high levels of debt
among recent generations of young adults (5, 22).
The results for Black men support prior studies that
have found little evidence of an association between
SES and obesity for this population (6–9). One

potential explanation is the diminishing returns theory
of SES among Black Americans (39, 40). Unlike
White women and men, socioeconomic attainment can
actually increase exposure to discrimination among
Black men and women as they enter predominately
White workplaces, and these experiences generally
have a positive association with obesity (41, 42).
Taken together, these studies suggest that racial
discrimination among high-SES Black men may
negate any obesity-related advantages that wealth
might otherwise provide.
Finally, the analysis revealed several non-linear
relationships between components of wealth and
obesity. For example, women in the second quartile of
savings had the highest probability of obesity when
compared to women in either lower or higher quartiles
of savings. Related, prior research examining the
middle class has found higher levels of anxiety among
the lower-middle class, whose middle-class status may
be tenuous, only one financial emergency away from
poverty or even homelessness (43). The stress of living
in this precarious economic position may in turn cause
weight gain, providing further evidence that wealth
can increase the probability of obesity under certain
conditions (44).
This study is the first to examine how wealth and its
components are related to obesity among adults
entering midlife, but it still has notable limitations.
First, our findings are largely descriptive. We were
primarily concerned with establishing a baseline
association between components of wealth and obesity
across key social groups. Future research should
examine the underlying mechanisms that link wealth
to obesity with a focus on directly testing how stress
and health behaviors mediate the wealth-obesity
relationship we find here. Second, we do not consider
wealth shocks. A number of recent studies have found
wealth shocks can have a direct impact on
physiological functioning related to obesity (2, 3).
Although beyond the scope of this study, future
research should examine how substantial drops in
5

Wealth and Obesity Wolfe, Baker, and Scarinci
wealth affect health behaviors and, in turn, BMI.
Lastly, we use self-reported height and weight to
calculate BMI, and while it is a good proxy for
measured height and weight, there are validity and
reliability concerns related to race, gender, and
education. But misreporting by race/gender should not
be an issue in our analyses given that they are stratified
by race and gender, and we were concerned about
patterns within groups rather than examining
disparities between groups. Also, controls for
education likely help to account for reporting
differences. Nevertheless, future work should confirm
our results using measured height and weight (45).
CONCLUSION
Past research examining SES and health in midlife has
highlighted the need to understand how wealth impacts
health. We found that housing wealth, savings, and
debt were each important correlates of adult obesity,
but although the association between wealth and
obesity was robust, it also varied substantially by
gender and race. Thus, studies of adult obesity that do
not incorporate wealth into statistical models may
overlook important links between SES and obesity and
the structural inequalities that create them. Our results
also have implications for social policy. First, social
programs aimed at health and obesity disparities
should always consider multiple sources of wealth and
their implications for different social groups when
developing and implementing obesity-related
interventions. Second, policies that reduce the
obesogenic qualities of disadvantaged neighborhoods
could simultaneously reduce obesity-related health
issues and stimulate property values within a
community. Finally, our results suggest that policies
aimed at reducing debt and financial insecurity may
also help reduce obesity rates among middle-aged
Black women.
