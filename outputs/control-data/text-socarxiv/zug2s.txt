Abstract
How does expansion in the high-tech sector influence the broader economy of a region? We demonstrate that an infusion of venture capital
in a region appears associated with: (i) a decline in entrepreneurship,
employment, and average incomes in other industries in the tradable
sector; (ii) an increase in entrepreneurship and employment in the
non-tradable sector; and (iii) an increase in income inequality in the
non-tradable sector. An expansion in the high-tech sector therefore
appears to lead to a less diverse tradable sector and to increasing
inequality in the region.

Introduction
Silicon Valley has been the quintessential high tech cluster. It emerged

with the arrival of semiconductors. Orange groves became offices. It then rose
to prominence as its startups grew into technology giants first in hardware,
then in software, in networking, in on-line businesses, and in social media
(Saxenian, 1994; Kenney, 2000; O’Mara, 2019). The modern-day gold rush
continues. Today, more of the acclaimed “unicorns” – startups with private
valuations in excess of one billion dollars – reside in the Bay Area than in
any other part of the country.1
Yet, Silicon Valley also has its ills. Housing has become scarce and expensive. Few can afford it. Employees have resorted to living out of cars and
recreational vehicles and to sharing apartments with dozens of strangers (e.g.,
Nieves, 2000; Barr, 2019). The tech titans – the likes of Apple, Alphabet,
and FaceBook – lavish their employees with pay and perquisites. But other
employers struggle with the rising cost of doing business (e.g., Kendall and
Castaneda, 2019; Staff, 2019). Entrepreneurs, meanwhile, find it difficult to
recruit and retain talent.
The current state of Silicon Valley – especially the growing costs of doing business in the region – reminds us of another phenomenon: the Dutch
Disease. The Dutch Disease refers to what happened to the economy of the
Netherlands following the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea (Ellman,
1

According to the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, more than half of all unicorn
companies in the United States have their headquarters in the Bay Area (Council, 2019).

1981; Corden, 1984). The exporting of large volumes of petroleum led to
the rapid appreciation of the Dutch guilder. Currency appreciation, in turn,
raised the effective costs for exporters in the manufacturing sector, leading to
their demise and the de-industrialization of the Netherlands. This economic
boom created a more concentrated and less robust economy.
The Dutch Disease has generally been seen as a national-level phenomenon
(Corden and Neary, 1982; Corden, 1984). Since regions do not have their own
currencies, they may appear immune to contracting it. But booming industrial clusters can create a similar dynamic.2 Rising wages and real estate
prices increase the cost of doing business. These rising costs prove particularly problematic for the tradable sector because these businesses must
compete with those operating elsewhere, in lower cost places. As a result,
the tradable sector of the economy becomes increasingly concentrated on the
booming industries.
Studying these dynamics empirically can pose a challenge, particularly
in disentangling cause and effect. As a source of semi-exogenous variation,
we focus on venture capital. Venture capital has been critical to financing
startups and rapidly growing firms in high-tech industries. Changes in its
supply therefore create mini-shocks to the tech sector in a region. Indeed,
past research has demonstrated that increases in the supply of venture capital
stimulates entrepreneurship, creates jobs, and raises regional income (Samila
2

Although the booming sectors in the literature have been natural resource-based industries, the formal models of booming and lagging export industries conceptually allow
for any type of industry to be the booming sector (e.g., Corden and Neary, 1982).

2

and Sorenson, 2011). But research has not considered the extent to which
these effect may vary across industries, creating winners and losers.
We treat the industry-region-quarter as the unit of analysis. Within these
units, our analyses estimate the relationship between an increase in venture
capital funding over a five-year period and entrepreneurship, employment,
and average income in the subsequent quarter. We divide industries into
three groups: (1) the portion of the tradable sector of interest to venture
capitalists; (2) the remainder of the tradable sector; and (3) the non-tradable
sector. We explore the differential effects of venture capital across these three
groups of industries over a window running from 2003 to 2012.
Infusions of venture capital appear associated with three patterns. The
tradable sector as a whole contracts; the number of firms and employees drop
and average income actually falls within these industries, with rising venture
capital. By contrast, the number of firms and employees in the non-tradable
sector increases. Income within the non-tradable sector, meanwhile, becomes
more dispersed. While those at the bottom of the income distribution – such
as bartenders and waiters – experience no changes in their earnings – those
as the top – such as dentists and doctors – earn more.
Overall then, inequality almost certainly rises with infusions of venture
capital. The tradable sector generally accounts for the wealth of a region and
provides its better-paying jobs (Verhoogen, 2008; Helpman et al., 2010). As
this segment of the economy declines, it hollows out the middle of the income
distribution. The non-tradable sector, meanwhile, becomes more unequal in
3

response to venture capital investments. The poor do no better while the rich
get richer. This combination of the crowding out of the other segments of
the tradable sector with rising income inequality appears to be the signature
symptoms of the Silicon Valley Syndrome.

2

The Dutch Disease
In the 1960s, the Netherlands began to export natural gas and related

products in large and growing quantities.3 The value of the Dutch guilder rose
relative to other currencies. Other exporting industries therefore experienced
corresponding increases in their costs of production (in terms of the currencies
of importing countries). In fact, declines in manufacturing exports ended up
being so severe that they more than offset the exports of petroleum. Exports
as a whole fell.
The “Dutch Disease” has therefore become a popular term for the idea
that a booming extraction sector – whether oil, natural gas, or diamonds
– can crowd out a lagging manufacturing sector.4 Three main mechanisms
produce the symptoms. First and foremost, the rapid rise in exports of the
natural resource leads to an appreciation in the currency (Gylfason et al.,
1999). Because manufacturers cannot easily reduce their wages and other
3

For extended reviews of the history behind the Dutch Disease, see Ellman (1981) and
Corden (1984).
4
The Economist actually coined the term in 1977 (Corden, 1984). Note that the Dutch
Disease differs somewhat from the “resource curse” literature (e.g., Mehlum et al., 2006;
Komarek, 2018). The resource curse has often been associated with crime, corruption, and
a failure to build strong institutions in the literature on economic development.

4

expenses, they experience an increase in their costs relative to competing
producers in other countries. Exporters outside the booming sector therefore
find it difficult to compete.
Second, the booming natural resource sector offers higher returns. Firms
in the extraction sector can afford to pay higher salaries to employees. They
also offer higher interest rates and more attractive returns to investors. Talent and capital therefore flow out of other industries into the booming sector
(Corden and Neary, 1982). Not only do other parts of the tradable economy
experience higher costs but also they may find themselves starved of human
and financial capital.
Third, the dependence of exports on natural resource prices leads to increasing instability in exchange rates. The prices of commodities often swing
wildly as supply and demand move temporarily out of equilibrium. When
commodities account for a large share of exports, these fluctuations propagate into exchange rates. Exchange rate volatility increases the uncertainty
investors face and therefore further depresses capital investment, both in the
tradable and non-tradable sectors (Gylfason et al., 1999). These fluctuations
also complicate the management of global supply chains.

3

The Silicon Valley Syndrome
At first blush, the Dutch Disease feels far removed from Silicon Valley.

Leaving aside any legacy of the gold rushes of the 1800s, Silicon Valley’s

5

wealth comes from entrepreneurship and innovation not from the extraction
of natural resources. As a region in a large state in an even larger country,
moreover, Silicon Valley would seem immune to the exchange rate issues
underlying the Dutch Disease.
But adjustments can occur on many margins. The booming tech sector
in Silicon Valley has almost certainly increased the price of doing business
there. To recruit and retain talent, the high-tech titans have raised pay and
perquisites to new levels—in addition to high salaries, employment at the
leading high-tech firms often includes access to free gyms and cafeterias and
even to exclusive buses to and from the company campuses (e.g., Schrodt,
2017). Real estate costs have also been rising rapidly.
Far from being unique to Silicon Valley, these rising costs probably represent a general feature of a booming technology sector. Consider the design
side of Apple, the Google search engine, or Abbvie’s Humira antibody. Because few alternatives exist, these products and services generate enormous,
windfall-like, profits for the firms producing them. Firms in these booming
technology industries can therefore afford to pay high salaries and high rents,
and they offer investors attractive returns (Corden and Neary, 1982).
Real estate prices soar as these firms and their well-paid employees compete for the limited supplies of office space and of housing. Booming hightech industries, moreover, may have unusually large effects on residential
real estate prices in a region.5 Because equity awards factor so heavily into
5

These real estates run-ups have undoubtedly been more severe in Silicon Valley because

6

compensation in these industries, employees themselves experience windfalls
in wealth when their firms get acquired or go public. Employees often use
these windfalls to purchase housing.
Whether other factor prices rise in real terms at a regional level, however,
depends in part on the mobility of labor and capital. At the national level,
borders create barriers. Whether due to language differences or legal restrictions on entry, employees from outside the country often find it difficult to
immigrate in response to rising wages. Exchange rates similarly deter the
movement of financial capital into a country. In the context of the Dutch
Disease then, thinking of the factor side of the economy as being relatively
fixed does not represent a heroic assumption.
Regions actually do not seem so different. Although regions within countries experience some expansion in the supply of capital and talent in response to a booming tradable sector, people and money do not flow freely
across places. Employees, for example, appear strongly attached to the regions in which they have family and friends (Dahl and Sorenson, 2010). They
only move when they can expect to earn tens of thousands of dollars more in
another place. As a consequence, even large differentials in real wages across
regions can persist for extended periods of time.
Capital similarly exhibits a strong home bias. Lenders and equity investors favor firms near them when they choose where to invest (Coval and
it has one of the most constrained housing supplies in the world. Natural features of
the area, such as the fact that it sits on a geologically-unstable peninsula, impose some
constraints. But tax policy, zoning, and building restrictions exacerbate this situation.

7

Moskowitz, 1999; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001; Petersen and Rajan, 2002).
Whether this tendency reflects the fact that investors have better information on firms headquartered near them (van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp,
2009) or the possibility that investors may have biased opinions in favor of
familiar firms (Sorenson and Waguespack, 2006) remains an open question.
Regardless of the reason, however, even within countries, financial capital
ends up disproportionately deployed near its owners.

3.1

Tradable vs. non-tradable industries

The consequences of these rising factor prices vary by sector of the regional economy. A booming tech sector should crowd out the production
of other tradable goods and services in the region. The tech sector pulls
employees and capital away from these businesses. It also raises their effective costs of production. But businesses in the tradable sector, almost by
definition, must compete with those located elsewhere, in regions not experiencing a tech boom and therefore not subject to such cost inflation. These
businesses therefore become increasingly uncompetitive at the national and
international levels.
But the non-tradable sector by comparison might actually grow in response to these dynamics. Although the non-tradable sector must also contend with rising costs, businesses in these industries need not compete with
those elsewhere with lower cost structures.

8

The expansion of the tech sector also has a spending effect.6 As employment in the tech sector expands and as these employees earn more, their
demand for many types of local services, from coffee shops to orchestras, increases. Consistent with this expectation, several studies have found positive
associations between employment in the tradable sector and employment in
the non-tradable sector (Moretti and Thulin, 2013; van Dijk, 2017; Brenner
et al., 2018).
Interestingly, the demand for certain types of non-tradable services might
rise more than others in response to a high-tech boom. High-end offerings,
such as live music and sporting events and Michelin-starred restaurants, cannot easily expand their capacity. They therefore become status goods, sought
after by those at the top of the income distribution (Veblen, 1899). Given
the high salaries in and the wealth created by the tech sector, rising demand
for these luxury goods likely outstrips any increase in their supply.

4

Empirical Strategy
Investigating these processes can prove difficult. Most notably, the di-

rection of causality might flow in either direction. The demise of the manufacturing sector in a region might release resources—freeing managerial and
employee talent for use elsewhere in the economy (Sorenson, 2017). The
technology cluster in Waterloo, Ontario, for example, arose from the ashes
6
Models of the Dutch Disease also predict a spending effect in the non-tradable sector
(e.g., Corden and Neary, 1982).

of Research in Motion (the company that made the Blackberry).
A common strategy for dealing with this type of endogeneity has been
to find some sort of shock to the local economy that can serve as a source
of econometric identification. In examining the effects of natural resources
on local economies, researchers have, for example, examined the discovery of
oil and natural gas deposits in the region (Decker et al., 2017). In regions
already producing commodities, such as agricultural products, they have used
fluctuations in the international prices for these commodities as a source of
exogenous variation (Allcott and Keniston, 2018; Bernstein et al., 2018).
We believe that the supply of venture capital in a region provides a similar source of pseudo-exogenous variation for high tech industries. Venture
capital firms, financial intermediaries that provide funding to private companies in return for equity, have been on the rise in the United States since
the 1980s. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) reports that,
in 2017, venture capital firms in the United States deployed more than $80
billion into new investments and held more than $350 billion in assets under
management.
Two features of venture capital prove useful for our purposes. First, venture capital firms invest locally. Much has been written about the “one hour”
rule, by which venture capitalists will not invest in companies outside of a one
hour travel-time radius from their offices. Two forces appear responsible for
this effect. When evaluating potential investments, venture capitalists rely
on their social relationships for due diligence (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001).
10

Since these relationships connect them primarily to the regions in which they
live and work, they have limited ability to consider deals elsewhere. Venture
capitalists also prefer to invest locally so that they can monitor and advise
the companies in which they invest (Bernstein et al., 2016).
Second, venture capital stimulates the growth of the firms in which it
invests and the economic growth of the regions where those firms reside. At
the firm level, for example, firms backed by venture capital operate more
professionally and more efficiently, and grow more rapidly (Hellmann and
Puri, 2002; Davila et al., 2003; Bertoni et al., 2011; Chemmanaur et al.,
2011). At the regional level, venture capital encourages entrepreneurship,
creates jobs, and raises regional income (Samila and Sorenson, 2011).
One might nonetheless worry about the potential endogeneity of venture
capital investments themselves. If venture capitalists scan the country for
attractive opportunities, their decisions to invest in particular regions might
stem from them foreseeing high future returns in those places, perhaps due
to the discovery of an important technology. Any apparent regional effects,
therefore, might stem from these underlying trends rather than from the
venture capital investments themselves.
But two lines of research suggest that such active searching should not
pose an endogeneity problem at the regional level. On the one hand, venture
capital firms do not appear to have any unusual insight into which firms will
succeed (Mollick, 2013; Nanda et al., 2019). Even venture capitalists with a
history of successful investments do no better than chance in terms of their
11

ability to choose the next hot technology or the next emerging region (Nanda
et al., 2019).
On the other hand, research that has examined the effects of venture
capital at the regional level has found little evidence of endogeneity. Notably, analyses using instrumental variables to eliminate the influence of endogeneity in the supply of venture capital yield equivalent results, in terms
of direction and magnitude, to those from näive panel estimation (Samila
and Sorenson, 2011).

The Data
Our data on entrepreneurship, employment, and average wages come

from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) dataset
of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This database covers more than
95% of all jobs in the United States. Our measures of venture capital activity, meanwhile, have been derived from the Thomson Reuters’ VentureXpert
database.7 We use population data from the Census Bureau.
We constructed a panel dataset covering all Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States from 2003 to 2012. The U.S. Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) defines an MSA by selecting a core urban
7

Because the United States does not require venture capital firms to register or to
report their activities, a comprehensive list of all venture capital investments does not
exist. VentureXpert nevertheless appears to offer the most complete database on these
investments and has been the one most commonly used by academics studying the industry
(Kaplan and Lerner, 2017; Nanda et al., 2019).

12

area with at least 50,000 inhabitants and joining it with surrounding counties where at least 25% of the residents commute to that urban area. They
therefore represent reasonably independent economic units.
We chose our time window to ensure stability in these areal units. The
OMB redefines MSAs in response to each census. For example, the current
set of MSAs stem from the 2010 census. These redefinitions typically occur
three years after the census. Our 2003 to 2012 period therefore captures a
consistent set of regions based on the 2000 census.
Although the government currently identifies more than 380 MSAs in the
United States, several of these units only appeared with the incorporation
of information from the 2010 census. In 2003, the OMB had defined 369
regions as MSAs. Eight of them were in Puerto Rico, which we exclude from
our analysis. The BLS, moreover, did not have QCEW data available for
two MSAs: Danville (VA) and Sandusky (OH). Our final dataset therefore
contains a total of 359 MSAs.
The BLS reports information on employment and business activity within
six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. Examples of industries at this level of disaggregation would include “plastics bag
and pouch manufacturing” (NAICS 326111), “motor home manufacturing”
(NAICS 336213), and “full-service restaurants” (NAICS 722511). The BLS
reports this information each quarter. The MSA-industry-quarter therefore
serves as our unit of observation.

13

5.1

Dependent variables

Exactly how activity in the high-tech sector might influence the economy
depends on how entrepreneurs and organizations adjust to the rising demand
from the sector. Potential entrepreneurs, for example, might recognize the
challenges or opportunities, either entering or forgoing entry based on their
perceptions of the environment. But existing businesses might also expand
or contract. We therefore consider multiple measures of business activity in
each industry.
The BLS does not report information on the numbers of business starts
or closings. But they do provide information on the number of establishments – defined as a single physical location where business occurs – in each
industry and region. We therefore use the logged number of establishments
as our first outcome of interest.8 Increases and decreases in the number of
establishments, however, stem both from the births and deaths of entire enterprises and from openings and closings of locations (e.g., a chain restaurant
opening or closing an outlet).
Employment simply counts the total number of jobs in a region at establishments in a particular industry. It includes both full-time and part-time
employees. Note that this count can potentially include an individual more
than once if the person has more than one job. We log this count as our
measure of employment.
8

For privacy reasons, the BLS does not disclose industry-region information that would
aggregate fewer than three firms. Although this requirement means that some industryregions drop out of our analysis, it also ensures that we only have positive observed counts.

14

We use average weekly income per job, for a particular industry and
region, as a measure of the earnings associated with those jobs. Although
we refer to this measure as wages, it includes a variety of types of income.
Bonuses, stock options, reported tips, and retirement benefits, for example,
would all appear in these totals. For part-time employees, increases in these
average earnings could stem either from changes in the number of hours
worked or in the average amount earned per hour.9 Once again, we log these
average wages when using them as a dependent variable.

5.2

Venture capital

We considered three different measures of the supply of venture capital: the number of first-round investments, the total number of investment
rounds, and the total amount invested by venture capital firms in startups
headquartered in an MSA.10 We sum these measures over five years and log
them (adding one dollar to the summed amount to avoid missing values in
regions that did not receive any venture capital investments for a five-year
period). Table 1 lists the top-15 industries in terms of amount of venture
capital received since 1985.
These three measures essentially weight different stages of venture capi9
The BLS data do not report hours worked on a quarterly basis so we cannot adjust
for this margin in our analysis.
10
VentureXpert reports two investment amounts: the disclosed amount and the estimated amount. Although the estimated amount has fewer missing values, the disclosed
amount provides more accurate information. Our models therefore report estimates using
sums of the disclosed amounts.

15

tal investment. First round investments, roughly a measure of the number
of venture-capital-backed startups in the region, capture the effects of the
earliest round of funding. The number of investment rounds equally weights
earlier- and later-stage investments. Meanwhile, the total amount invested
effectively weights later-stage investments most heavily since the size of these
investments dwarfs earlier rounds. Later-stage rounds in unicorns have often
brought in billions of dollars whereas a typical first-round investment might
amount to no more than one million dollars.
Prior research suggests that early-stage investments have stronger effects
on the local economy than later ones (Samila and Sorenson, 2011). As companies mature and expand, they deploy more and more of the capital that
they raise outside of the regions that they call home. Relatively little of the
billions of dollars invested in Uber over the past few years, for example, has
gone to hiring people in the Bay Area. Most of it has been dispersed around
the globe to subsidize drivers in the dozens of cities in which it operates.
Our measures of venture capital activity aggregate the number of investments and the amount of funds invested for the five years prior to each
quarter. We do so for two reasons. First, because of the small numbers of
companies being funded, these measures bounce around from one quarter to
the next. Smoothing helps to reduce underestimation due to the noisiness
of the measure (i.e. attenuation bias). Second, the effects of venture capital investments unfold over time. Samila and Sorenson (2011), for example,
reported that venture capital had significant effects on regional economic
16

growth for at least three years following the year of an investment. By aggregating across five years, our estimates capture these regional economic
effects for five years from the time of investment.

5.3

Tradable vs. non-tradable

The empirical literature on the Dutch Disease has typically equated the
tradable sector with manufacturing (Allcott and Keniston, 2018). That assumption would not have been so problematic at the time that the Netherlands discovered oil, as manufacturing did then account for the vast majority
of exports. But in modern economies, services can also account for a large
share of what gets produced in a region but consumed elsewhere.
As part of their effort to understand industrial clusters, Delgado et al.
(2014) have created a classification of industries in terms of being traded or
not. Their definition incorporates cutoffs on multiple criteria, such as the
proportion of regions with no employment in the industry and the degree of
geographic concentration of employment. We use this classification for our
primary analysis. We, however, modify it to exclude traded industries that
themselves have received a large amount of venture capital.11
But their coding also has a disadvantage for our purposes: It defines
industries as being either traded or non-traded (local). Many industries,
however, especially services, probably reside someplace in between. They
11
We classify industries as having received a large amount of venture capital if more
than 1% of venture capital dollars during our window went to the industry.

17

vary in the degree that they serve customers elsewhere. We might therefore
prefer a measure of the degree of being traded.
To address this issue, we created our own measure of industry “tradability” —the extent to which businesses in an industry probably sell their goods
and services outside of the region in which they produce them. We assess
tradability by using the geographic Theil Index (T I):

T Ij =

N
1 ∑
1
pij log( ),
N i=1
pij

(1)

where i indexes regions and p equals the proportion of all jobs in industry j
located in region i. In essence, our measure captures the extent to which employment in an industry spreads evenly across regions in the United States.
The higher the Theil Index, as calculated by (1), the more local the industry.
Because regions must produce their own non-traded goods and services, employment in these industries should end up distributed fairly evenly across
regions. Concentration in production primarily occurs when one region can
export to another. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the variables of
interest.

Results
We estimate the effects of the supply of venture capital on the number

of establishments, the number of jobs, and average weekly wages for each

18

industry in each region. We allow these effects to vary according to the
characteristics of the industry, namely whether we consider it part of the
traded sector or not. Our models include MSA-level fixed effects to control for
time-invariant characteristics of regions that may influence both the economic
vitality of the region and the amount of venture capital invested there. We
also include quarter fixed effects to account for any national-level trends in
economic activity. We also control for the (logged) population in the region.
Our log-on-log specifications allow one to interpret the coefficients as
elasticities. These elasticities may seem small but venture capital funds a thin
slice of the economy even in the most heavily-concentrated high-technology
clusters. Even small elasticities therefore often imply out-sized effects of
these investments on the regional economy (Samila and Sorenson, 2011).

6.1

Discrete sectors

Table 3 reports the results for the effects on the number of establishments. Consider first the left-most column. In these models, the control
variables for the traded and non-traded sectors capture differences in the
average number of establishments within these industries. Non-traded businesses tend to have more locations than traded ones. That’s not surprising.
Many local businesses – such as restaurants or gas stations – have small
catchment areas and therefore require many outlets to serve geographicallydispersed consumers. Population, meanwhile, captures the extent to which

19

the number of establishments expands with population growth.12
The results of interest concern the effects of venture capital. We have
estimated these models using “effects” coding. In other words, the main
effect of venture capital captures the average effect of venture capital across
all industries in the economy. The interaction effects – for traded and nontraded industries – then estimate the extent to which the effects in those sets
of industries deviate from the average effect. In this first model, the total
amount of venture capital dollars has a small, positive effect on the number of
establishments in the economy. But the effects vary across sectors. Whereas
the number of establishments increases in the non-traded sector with an
increase in the amount of venture capital invested in the region, it decreases
in the traded sector (outside of those industries receiving venture capital
investments).
The next two columns estimate the same models but with alternative
measures of venture capital activity, number of venture capital investment
rounds (second column) and number of first-round investments (third column). We see the same pattern: Venture capital investments lead to more
establishments in the non-traded sector but to fewer in the traded sector.
Earlier-stage investments, however, have larger effects on the number of establishments than later-stage investments. For example, whereas a 1% in12

To the extent that population growth stems from people moving into the region in
response to the favorable economic conditions there, one could argue that the models
should not adjust for population size (because it becomes endogenous to economic growth).
Excluding this variable yields somewhat larger effect sizes.

20

crease in the amount of venture capital predicts a 0.027% increase in the
number of establishments in the non-traded sector, a 1% increase in the
number of venture capital rounds and first rounds predict 0.085% and 0.11%
increases, respectively, in this number of establishments.
Table 4 describes a parallel set of models for the number of jobs. Once
again, venture capital has a positive effect, on average, on employment in
the region. Interestingly, the size of the effects estimated here correspond
closely to those found by Samila and Sorenson (2011), for the effects of venture capital on employment for 1993–2002. Our estimates suggest somewhat
larger elasticities in our more recent period but our measure captures jobs
rather than full-time equivalent jobs, as in Samila and Sorenson (2011). The
differences therefore could stem either from venture capital having larger effects on employment in the more recent period or from venture capital being
associated with the creation of more part-time jobs.
But these average effects mask massive variation in the employment effects across industries. Whereas infusions of venture capital predict large
increases in employment in the non-traded sector, these gains end up being
offset by declines in employment in the traded sector. Once again, earlierstage investments predict larger effects than later-stage investments, consistent with companies deploying much of this later-stage funding outside of
the regions where they are headquartered.
Table 5 finally reports models for average weekly wages. Venture capital
has no average effect on weekly wages. That might seem surprising given that
21

Samila and Sorenson (2011) found that venture capital increased regional
income. But, rather than average income, they studied aggregate income—
the average income times the number of jobs. If we used aggregate income,
we too would find a positive effect, but it would stem not from increases in
average income but from growth in the number of jobs.
Although income does not rise on average, infusions of venture capital do
raise income for those in the non-traded sector. By contrast, venture capital
investments predict declining income in the traded sector. This latter effect
seems surprising. But recall that the traded sector in these models does
not include industries funded by venture capital. This coefficient therefore
represents a relative difference: Traded industries that do not receive venture
capital funding have slower wage growth than those that do. But this effect
probably also stems, in part, from changes in the composition of employees.
As the high-tech sector recruits those with the highest human capital away
from other parts of the traded sector, those remaining in these industries will
have lower average earnings.

6.2

Continuous tradability

As noted above, rather than being traded or non-traded, industries vary
along a continuum in the extent to which they serve customers at a distance.
Consider accounting. Larger firms in this industry often serve customers at a
regional, national or even global scale. But smaller accounting firms typically
have clients only within their cities. By contrast, gas stations operate only
22

at a local level. We therefore also analyzed the data using our continuous
measure of tradability.
Table 6 reports the results of these models. Although this table only
details the results using the total amount of venture capital, our other measures of venture capital also produce equivalent effects with the continuous
measure as they did with the discrete one. Across all of the outcomes, the
effects for the continuous measure parallel those using the discrete sectors.
Using either measure of being tradable, moreover, earlier-stage investments
have larger effects on the regional economy than later-stage ones.
Recall that a value of zero on our continuous measure would imply that
the entire industry resided within a single MSA. The “main” effects of venture
capital in these models therefore capture the effects of venture capital in a
highly concentrated industry, one that produces in one location but sells
to consumers across the country. In these tradable industries, increases in
the amount of venture capital invested in a region predict reductions in the
number of establishments and the number of jobs, and in the average earnings
of these employees. But as industries become more dispersed, the effects shift.
For industries that are dispersed across regions (non-tradable industries),
infusions of venture capital led to increases in the number of establishments
and the number of jobs, as well as to rising wages.

6.3

Heterogeneity in the non-traded sector

We finally explored whether local (non-traded) industries varied in their
response to venture capital investments in the region. As noted above, services that require highly-skilled employees may have greater difficulty expanding their operations. To explore this issue, we split the non-traded
sector into four groups, based on their average weekly wage at the national
level. The bottom group, for example, includes retail bakeries, grocers, and
convenience stores. The top group, meanwhile, includes clinics and hospitals,
commercial banks, and law firms.
Table 7 reports the results of regressions where we allow infusions of
venture capital to have different effects across these subsets of non-traded
industries. The first column reports results for the number of establishment,
the second column the number of employees, and the third column average weekly wages. Venture capital has consistent and similar effects on the
number of establishments and the number of jobs across these groups. But
average weekly wages diverge. In the lowest income quartile, average income
actually declines. But as one moves up the income quartiles, the effects of
venture capital on average income becomes more and more positive. Income
inequality rises.

Discussion
Policymakers around the globe have seen Silicon Valley as a model for

economic development. In some ways, they should envy it. The high-tech
cluster there has propelled the region to having the highest per capita income
of any region in the United States. But Silicon Valley also has a dark side:
Housing has become unaffordable to most; the cost of doing business there
has risen rapidly; and the dynamism of the economy has been declining
(Fairlie and Chatterji, 2013).
We cast these regional economic dynamics as a cousin of the Dutch Disease. In many countries, the discovery of natural resources has led to economic booms based on extracting and exporting these resources. But these
booms simultaneously render these national economies fragile, as the natural
resource sector crowds out other exporters. Although an expanding high-tech
sector may stimulate the demand for local goods and services, it can crowd
out other tradable industries within the region, as it consumes human and
financial capital.
We explore these dynamics empirically by estimating the effects of infusions of venture capital on regional economies, metropolitan standard areas
in the United States. These investments create small, semi-exogenous jolts
to the local tech sector, allowing us to explore how the expansions they fund
ripple through the economy.
Investments of venture capital have different effects for businesses in the

25

traded and non-traded segments of the economy. In the traded sector, these
infusions of capital predict future declines in the number of establishments,
in aggregate employment, and in average earnings. The high-tech sector
therefore appears to crowd out other exporting industries.
Meanwhile, the non-traded sector expands. Infusions of venture capital
increase the number of establishments in these industries, the aggregate number of jobs available in them, and the average earnings of those holding these
jobs. Wealth created by the tech sector leads to a spending effect, increasing
the demand for local goods and services.
But venture capital does not have uniform effects on businesses in this
sector. Although the effects on firm and job creation appear fairly constant
across the sector, the effects of venture capital on income vary across the
types of businesses. Lower-wage businesses – those that employ less-skilled
and less-specialized employees – actually pay their employees a little less
following infusions of venture capital. But employees in higher-wage businesses experience earnings growth. Income equality therefore rises within the
non-traded sector.
We contribute to at least two streams of literature. Although prior research has demonstrated that venture capital stimulates the growth of regional economies (Samila and Sorenson, 2011), it has not examined the extent to which this growth stems directly from the businesses being funded
versus indirectly through multiplier effects, as the wealth from these rapidlygrowing enterprises spills out into the regional economy. Our results suggest
26

that most of the increase in entrepreneurship and employment stems not from
venture capital increasing the number of high-tech businesses but rather from
it expanding the non-traded sector. This spending effect parallels that found
in response to income shocks in other exporting sectors, such as agriculture
(Bernstein et al., 2018) and extraction (Allcott and Keniston, 2018).
Our study also contributes to the literature on the crowding out effects of
booming industries in two ways. First and foremost, our results suggest that
crowding out represents a common phenomenon rather than one limited to a
rapid rise in the natural resource sector. Second, whereas the prior literature
has generally treated such crowding out as a national-level phenomenon,
we add to the small number of recent studies showing that these processes
operate even across regions within countries (Beine et al., 2015; Cust and
Poelhekke, 2015).
The implications for regional development seem at least two-fold. On the
one hand, the dynamics unfolding here point to another self-reinforcing dynamic in the emergence and persistence of industrial clusters. A substantial
stream of research has shown that the geographic concentration of industries
limits where entrepreneurs in the industry can found their firms (Sorenson
and Audia, 2000; Klepper, 2010; Sorenson, 2017). But regional economies
may also become increasingly concentrated on a small set of industries as
the highly-productive firms in these clusters crowd out other employers in
the tradable sector, further limiting the supply of future entrepreneurs in
other industries.
27

On the other hand, our results also point to an unintended downside to regional concentrations of high-tech industries: increasing economic inequality.
These industries create wealth. But the “trickle down” effect of this wealth,
as the owners and employees of these companies increase their spending on
local goods and services, only appears to go so far down. It benefits those
at the high end—the already well-off accountants, doctors, and lawyers. But
those at the lower end of the service economy, the servers and taxi drivers,
appear simply to fall further behind.
