Abstract:
In this paper, we propose a methodological framework to analyse cross-sectorial elite career using sequence
analysis to identify particular career trajectories. As empirical case, we use 416 members of the Danish power
elite, found in the core of the Danish elite networks. We describe how career data can be constructed based on
CV’s, how career states can be coded and how sequence analysis in combination with optimal matching and of
hierarchical agglomerative clustering can be used to develop typologies of careers.

Introduction
The purposes of this paper is to provide a methodological framework for building a typology of career patterns.
Thus, we describe how sequential data of careers can be collected and coded for cross-sectorial elites and how
to use optimal matching distances between individuals to create a set of different career clusters or trajectories.
Finally, we describe how to compare these clusters based on their different characteristics.
Since any comparison will always rest on the selections and definitions of the different qualities and
characteristics on which the compared may differ or not, the main focus of this working paper is laying out the
principles behind our approach.
Our population is what we call the Danish power elite: 423 individuals belonging to the core of the Danish elite
networks in 2012. These were identified though a k-core decomposition to a large relational database of 5079
boards, networks, committees and councils consisting of 37,750 individuals and 56,536 positions (a more
detailed description of the methodology is described in Larsen & Ellersgaard 2017).
To analyse their careers we draw upon sequence analysis. Sequence analysis has already been used to study elite
careers (Abbott & Hrycak, 1990; Araujo 2018; Blair-Loy, 1999; Bühlmann, 2008; Koch, Forgues, & Monties
2017; Ohmura, Bailer, Meißner, & Selb 2018; Stovel, Savage, & Bearman, 1996; Seabrooke and Nilsson 2015).
However, all these studies focus on elites within a particular sector. The framework developed here aim to
extend this work to be used for a cross-sectorial elite group.

Data: Constructing the curriculum vitae data of the power elite
We draw on a wide range of sources. Portraits from the Danish equivalent of Who’s Who, Kraks Blå Bog, were
supported by LinkedIn profiles and official CVs found online. Further information is drawn from
approximately 3,000 newspaper portrait articles, acquired from infomedia.dk, a Danish newspaper article
database. Records were made on a year-to-year basis of the name and location of the employer organization
and descriptions of the job function. Furthermore, we gathered information on biographical details such as
social background, level and type of education and age from the same sources. Finally, we use the network
centrality calculated in Larsen & Ellersgaard (2017) to compare the groups identified in the analysis.
Some issues with the collection and treatment of CV are worth mentioning here. And many of these issues
concern the status of an employment. First, the time span can be difficult to access. Periods of employment
may not always be recordable in full length years. We dealt with this by simply rounding up to one year, when
the ‘event’ was more than half a year. Second, a time span in a CV or a portrait might cover several
employments, e.g. in 1982 to 2005 X was employed in A, B and C. In such cases, each employment was given
a proportional share of the whole period. Third, with regard to geographical location and career level, in
particular, the actual rhythm of ascend or the circulation between different offices may be ‘invisible’ in a CV
that only mentions the final position. In case this could not be reconstructed from other sources, we had to go
2

with the reported place and career level, even if it seemed somewhat implausible. One example could be a CEO,
who reports 15 years of employment as a ‘director’ in a medium-sized corporation directly after finishing his
university degree. It would seem plausible that he had in fact moved his way up to a management position, but
none of our sources can help us to distinguish the different career levels.

Coding of career states
Based on the reconstructed CVs, we constructed each career as an approximate year-by-year succession of
definite sets of possible states in six channels: sector, sub-sector, organization, organizational size, career level
and geographical position (see Table 1). In the analyses, we restricted ourselves to an analysis of the
‘employment careers’, leaving out education, and restricting the observed time range to the age of 20 to 70
years. Seven individuals were removed from the analysis, either because of too much missing data or because
the they were too young (under 40 years old) and therefore difficult to compare with the rest of the population.
This left us with a sample of 416 careers.

The sector channel was reduced to six broad categories: business, state administration, politics, unions, business
associations, and science and education, roughly corresponding to the different institutional orders found in
the analysis of the power elite (Larsen & Ellersgaard 2018) or to the fields on the field of power as described
by Bourdieu (1996). Almost exactly half of all states – 1300 of 2597 career years – took place in the business
sector, followed by state administration, science and education, with unions, business associations, and politics
as the least frequent sectors (see Table A2).
The sub-sector channel has 19 possible states, capturing both differences within and similarities across the sectors.
Sub-sectors like commerce and services, and technology and industries, thus, set aside different kinds of
business. On the other hand, it connects ‘industry-linked unions’ to ‘industry-linked business’. Similarly, subsectors distinguish between branches of state administration while connecting it to other sectors at sub-sector
level. The relationship between sector and sub-sector is displayed in Table 2.
Organizational size was coded as either very large (+5000 employees or +100,000 members), large (+500
employees or +10,000 members or the organization is part of the Danish Elite Network), medium-sized (10–
3

500 employees or +1000 members) or small (fewer than 10 employees or 1000 members) in order to capture
the weight of the organizations.

To capture the progression in career level we found inspiration in previous studies of career sequences (BlairLoy, 1999; Koch, Forgues, & Monties, 2017). A nine-level scheme was developed: 0: In education; 1: Manual
working occupation; 2: White-collar occupation or self-employed; 3: Career position at the lowest level, but
with access to probable promotion to higher positions, e.g. a junior lawyer or an assistant professor; 4:
Leadership position at the lowest level, e.g. a junior manager or a union secretary; 5: Senior leadership position,
such as an MP or a professor; 6: Chief executive position in a medium-sized organization or senior management
position in a larger organization, e.g. a CEO or a business association director; 7: Chief executive position in a
large organization, e.g. a permanent secretary of infrastructure or a university rector; 8: Chief executive position
4

in a very large organization, e.g. a prime minister, a monarch or a CEO of a top 50 corporation. Examples of
occupations falling into the different career levels based on size and sector of organization are shown in Table

The rhythm of organizational shifts is identified as succession of two different states: ‘new organization’, when an
organization is entered, or ‘same organization’, if it is the same as the year before.
Career geography is recorded in three possible states: provinces (outside the capital region), the capital region, and
abroad.
All codes have been tested for inter-coder reliability, and all values have been checked by at least two of the
researchers. An example of the coding of careers is found in the Appendix A, in which the careers of the pair
of most similar, of the pair of most different and of the two most central individuals of the Danish Elite
Network are shown.

Analysis: Developing a typology of careers
Measuring distance
Having defined the possible states within each sequence channel, we need a good measure of the distance
between the different sequences to develop reasonable and well-founded typologies and taxonomies, a craft
that has been a driving force in the development of all the empirical sciences (Benzécri, 1973). Here we apply
the optimal matching technique (Lesnard, 2014; Macindoe & Abbott, 2004). As opposed to distances based on
state distributions or counts of common attributes, the optimal matching (OM) distance is a so-called edit
distance (Ritschard & Studer, 2016). That is, the degree of difference or similarity between two distinct careers
amounts to the cost of transforming one sequence into the other. The transformation of sequences can be
done with three different ‘edit-operations’; i.e. by substituting, inserting, or deleting states. As there are often
many ways of ‘aligning’ to sequences, the ‘cheapest’ or optimal solution determines the distance, i.e. the one
requiring least edits. However, since not all states within a channel are equally similar or different (state
administration may or may not be more similar to politics than to business), we need to define the relative
similarity of the states; a major methodological challenge in any OM procedure (Gauthier, Widmer, Bucher, &
Notredame, 2009; Lesnard, 2010, 2014). Having no prior knowledge of the relative similarity, we rely here on
costs that are empirically generated from probabilities in our data. The cost of substituting one state for another
in order to align two sequences is low when it is empirically likely to go from the one state to the other in a
career, and higher when the shift from the one state to the other is less likely.
One thing is setting the cost of substituting one state or event with another and the cost of insertions and
deletions; another is balancing the ratio between substitution and insertion and deletion costs. This ratio
determines the weight given in the analysis to either timing or order (Lesnard, 2014). When the substitution
cost is larger than the insertion and deletion costs, the comparing of sequences amounts to the insertions and
deletions needed to find the longest common sub-string, whereas the comparison, when insertion and deletion
costs are larger than the substitution cost, becomes a kind of event approximation. In this analysis, we have
6

chosen a ‘cost scheme’ trying to balance out the two extremes by setting a constant insertion and deletion cost
at 1.1, i.e. a bit higher than half the maximum substitution cost, which is 2. There is, however, one important
exception. The cost of substituting missing states in the new organization versus that in the same organization
channel is set to 2.3, which is more than one insertion + one deletion, which means it will never be used, as it
is always less costly to insert and empty the slot in this sequence and delete the missing slot in the other.
The relatively recent development of multichannel sequence analysis (Gauthier, Widmer, Bucher, &
Notredame, 2010) makes it possible to study all the relevant characteristics of the careers simultaneously, thus
integrating the interaction between channels in the analysis. Based on the individual trajectory in these six
channels, two measures of diversity can be calculated, i.e. turbulence and internal entropy. While the turbulence
measure captures career volatility, i.e. the diversity and varying length of states in a sequence (Elzinga &
Liefbroer, 2007), entropy represents the ‘uncertainty’ of predicting the states in a sequence (Gabadinho,
Ritschard, Studer, & Müller, 2011, p. 78). In a sequence with low entropy, we have good chances of guessing
the next career move based on the previous one. Complexity is measured based on the number of distinct
subsequences and the variance of durations within these (Elzinga, 2010). Examples of the distances are found
in Appendix A.
Grouping the similar
To construct the typology of career paths presented in the article, we relied on the principle of hierarchical
agglomerative clustering (HAC). On the basis of a Euclidean distance measure, the optimal matching editdistance, between all pairs of career trajectories, groups of individuals (i.e. their careers) are created in successive
steps using the Ward criterion, which groups units in a way that in each step minimizes the increase in internal
variance within groups in relation to the variance between groups (Ward, 1963). In our analysis, we both look
at the two overall branches of this cluster and four and six clusters nested within these clusters. Inspecting the
structure of the tree, we find a fundamental distinction between private and public pathways to power (see
Figure 1). The first cluster is tied to careers in the private sector (n= 212) and has four sub-clusters: ‘the landed
gentry’, the ‘bankers’, the ‘industrial inner circle’ and the ‘corporate ambassadors’. The second main cluster is
tied to careers located mainly in the public sector or in interest organisations (n = 204) and has six sub-clusters:
‘education and local politics’, the ‘scientists’, the ‘unionists’, the ‘state nobility’, ‘professional politicians’ and the
‘lobbyists’. We arrive at the ten cluster due by heuristics – there is a sociologically interpretable differentiation
between clusters – and by assessing the ratio of the between-cluster-variance, or the variance of cluster mean
points, to the total variance of optimal matching distances. Identifying 10 clusters yields a correlation ratio of
η2 = 0.335, i.e. one-third of the total variance is ‘explained’ by the 10 clusters. Furthermore, as seen by Figure
2, the marginal benefit of including more clusters to account for more of the total variance – not to speak of
the difficulties of reporting about each cluster – decrease when choosing more than around 10 clusters (27
clusters is needed to explain 50 %).

To explore the homogeneity and diversity in the 10 clusters identified in the analysis, progression in career by
age can be seen by career level in Figure 3 and by the six channels – sector, subsector, organizational size,
organization location, career level and career changes – in Figure Appendix B. Characteristics of each cluster
are described in Appendix C. We identified significant deviations between the group mean and the global
mean on a range of characteristics, related to both career traits and other biographical information such as
type and length of education and parental background. Test-values were calculated as proposed by Lebart,
Morineau and Piron (2006), where absolute values above 2 indicate a significant difference between the group
mean (or frequency) and the global mean (or frequency).

Concluding remarks
This paper have provided examples on how to collect, code and through multichannel sequence analysis
develop typologies of elites careers. We use the careers of 426 members of the Danish power elite as empirical
case. We argue that a solution identifying two main clusters, and four and six subclusters within these clusters
best serves as heuristics to develop a typology for elite careers. Furthermore, we show how to characterize the
clusters based on the variables included in the sequence analysis and descriptive characteristics of the
individuals.
