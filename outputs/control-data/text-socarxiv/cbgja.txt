"5" "Abstract"
"6" "The current study  sought to determine the  potential  effect of a  minimum unit price  policy on advertised prices  for alcoholic beverages at  an off-premise outlet.  A free, weekly circular was monitored for advertised alcohol prices from July 2017 to June 2018.  For each advertised price,  t he number of standard drinks per purchase, the price per standard drink, and the frequency of prices that would increase under a MUP policy similar to Scotland’s  was determined .  There was an inverse correlation between the number of standard drinks per purchase and the  advertised price per standard drink for beer/malt beverages (r   =   -0.76,   p   < 0.001) and wine (r   =   -0.42, p   <   0.001) , which would be eliminated under MUP .  Under  MUP, 59.8% of advertised prices for beer/malt beverages would increase.   Implementation of MUP  may  significantly impact beer and malt  beverage  prices in the off-premise location monitored in the study."

"8" "Introduction"
"9" "The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified several pricing policies as effective  and cost-effective  measures to reduce the disease burden of alcohol consumption (WHO, 2010).  Among the most novel strategies is minimum unit pricing (MUP), which requires that a fixed price be paid per standard unit of alcohol in an alcoholic beverage regardless of beverage type.  Effectively a tax on alcohol strength, MUP policies simultaneously create a floor price for alcoholic beverages and prevent alcohol producers from selling high strength products, often approaching the alcohol content of wine, at the tax level of beer, cider, and other malt beverages."
"10" "In 2018, after a protracted legal dispute, Scotland became the first nation to fully implement a MUP policy, at  50 pence per 8 grams  of alcohol (Meier et al., 2017).  Although the long-term impact of Scotland’s MUP is not yet known, several simulation studies suggest significant improvements in alcohol consumption and related health consequences.  A MUP policy is anticipated to significantly impact heavy drinkers, with over two-thirds of heavy drinkers predicted to decrease their alcohol purchases (Gill et al., 2017).  Alcohol-related mortality rates among heavy drinkers may decline by up to 10%, based on an individual’s occupation (Meier et al., 2016), and over 600 deaths and nearly 24,000 hospital admissions may be prevented overall (Brennan et al., 2014).  Moreover, MUP may reduce alcohol-related health disparities, with over 80% of the reductions in premature mortality occurring among the lowest socioeconomic classes (Holmes et al., 2014)."
"11" "The immediate impact of Scotland’s MUP policy was a dramatic increase in the prices of some alcoholic products.  Based on purchasing data collected from October 2015 to September 2016, the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded that the average price for all alcoholic beverages  sold in off-premise locations (e.g. liquor stores, bottle shops) would increase by 35% after implementation, with prices for ciders and sparkling wine increasing by 90% and 116%, respectively (Griffith et al., 2017).  After implementation, real alcoholic beverage prices of low cost products sold in off-premise locations were reported to increase by approximately 30% due to MUP, with the prices of some products, particularly high strength ciders, increasing by over 200% (BBC News, 2018; Eighteen, 2018; Jackson, 2018)."
"12" "While the direct effect of MUP is to reduce alcohol consumption through increased prices, MUP may also have an indirect effect by increasing the advertised price of alcoholic beverages, which may subsequently discourage consumers from entering a location that sells alcohol.  Therefore, t he purpose of this study was to estimate the immediate impact of a Scottish-style MUP policy on advertised prices for alcoholic beverages for an off-premise retail establishment located in the northeast United States (U.S.).  Impact was determined by the proportion of advertised prices th at  may  increase if MUP  were implemented  and changes in the correlation between the number of standard drinks per purchase and price per standard drink."
"13" "Methods"
"14" "Data Collection"
"15" "Advertised prices  for beer, malt beverages, and wine  were  monitored  from July 2017 to June 2018 via surveillance   of  a free weekly circular  distributed by a supermarket in the northeast U.S.    The one - year time period was selected to account for seasonal  variations in price .   T he following information was collected for each advertised alcohol product: product type, brand, sub-brand, purchase price, number of containers per purchase (e.g. 1 bottle of wine, 6 cans of beer), and size of containers (e.g. 750  milliliters [ mL ]  bottle of wine, 12  ounce  [oz]  can of beer).  In some cases, the term “selected varieties” was used instead of a  specific  sub-brand of alcohol.   When this occurred, any images associated with the advertised  price  were  examined  to identify the sub-brand being sold.  If no sub-brand was identified, the price was excluded from further analysis.  Sub-brands were identified for all beer  and malt beverage   products .  Sub-brands could not be identified for 27 .3 % of wine  products   (259 out of 947 advertised prices) ."
"16" "For each  included  alcohol sub-brand,  alcohol by volume (ABV)  was determined by searching  corporate  ( e.g.   www.budlight.com ) and consumer websites ( e.g .  www.wine.com ).   For wines, vintages were not specified.  Therefore, ABV information for the most recent vintage  available  was used."
"17" "Data  Calculations"
"18" "First,  the  standard drinks per purchase  was calculated using the  following  procedure :"
"19" "T otal beverage volume  ( in mL ) =  ( T otal number of containers per purchase )   x  ( C ontainer volume ).    The volume of beer and malt beverage containers were converted from  oz  to   mL  prior to performing this calculation;"
"20" "T otal volume of alcohol per purchase   = (T otal beverage volume per purchase )   x (S ub-brand ’ s ABV ) ;"
"21" "M ass of alcohol per purchase  ( in grams  [ g ]) = (V olume of alcohol per purchase ) x (ethanol density [ i.e. 0.79g/mL ])  ( NIOSH, 2016 );"
"22" "Number  of standard drinks per purchase  = (M ass of alcohol per purchase ) /  14g .  14g  is considered a standard alcoholic drink in the U.S. ( NIAAA, 2005 )."
"23" "Second, the price per standard drink was calculated  by  dividing the advertised purchase price by  the  number of standard drinks per purchase."
"24" "Third , the U.S. equivalent to Scotland’s MUP of 50 pence per United Kingdom (U.K.) standard drink  was determined .  The average exchange rate between the British pound (£) and  the U.S. dollar ($) across the study period was obtained from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank   and  was  $1.3482 per  £1  (BOGFRS, 2018) .  Therefore,  £0. 50 was the equivalent of approximately $0.67.   This value was multiplied by 1.75 to account for the different definition of standard al coholic drinks in the U.S. (14g ) and the U.K. (8g) (i.e. 14/8 = 1.75).   Therefore,  the U.S. equivalent of Scotland’s MUP was estimated as  $1.18."
"25" "Analysis"
"26" "Beer and malt beverages were analyzed separately from wine.   Pearson’s  correlations were used to determine the relationship between the  standard drinks per purchase  and  the  advertised  price  per standard drink   versus the potential   advertised  price  per standard drink  under MUP.  Frequency distributions were used to determine the proportion of prices that could theoretically change under MUP  and 95% confidence intervals were  calculated .  Frequency distributions were also examined for hypothetical MUPs at $1.25, $1.50, $1.75, and $2.00.   An independent t-test  was used to determine if the exclusion of the selected variety wine sub-brands would have inflated or deflated the effect of the MUP.   Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.)."
"27" "Results"
"28" "T here were 1,865 price  advertisements  collected:   918 prices for 27 brands and 50 sub-br ands of beer and malt beverage and  947  prices for 100 brands and 206 sub-brands of wine.    Beers and malt beverages  were most commonly  sold in pack s  of 12 (50.5%)  (Table 1) .  Nearly all (93.9%) of beer and malt beverage products were sold in 12oz cans or bottles.  Wine was most commonly sold as single bottles (98.4%) containing 750mL of product (87.0%).   Approximately 12% of advertised wines were sold in 1500mL or 3000mL containers."

"130" "Discussion"
"131" "In the sample of advertised alcohol prices, the  advertised  price per standard drink decreased as the number of standard drinks per purchase increased for both beer/malt beverages and wine, indicating a significant price discount when buying larger  volumes  of alcohol.  Introduction of a Scottish-style MUP policy  may  eliminate this relationship.  Moreover, the average advertised purchase price of beer and malt beverages  may  increase by approximately $2."
"132" "If a MUP similar in scale to the policy implemented in Scotland was applied, a majority of advertised prices for beer and malt beverages would increase.  Practically, a MUP would eliminate discounts for larger volume purchases, which were apparent in the sample of advertised prices.   For example, e ven within the same sub-brand, the  advertised  price per standard drink was lower when a greater volume of product was purchased (e.g. the price per standard drink was $0.08 lower for a 30-pack of 12oz Coors Light containers compared to a 12-pack)."
"133" "A similar effect would not been seen for wine, and a drastically higher MUP (e.g. > $2.00  per standard drink ) would be needed to impact the majority of advertised wine prices.  However, the present analysis likely underestimates the impact a MUP might have because advertised wine prices excluded from the analysis were significantly lower than the wine prices included in the analysis.  Since 27% of advertised wine prices were excluded, it is conceivable than an  additional 10-15% of wine prices may increase under the lowest cost MUP policy examined here."
"134" "Although several studies suggest that MUP will reduce alcohol consumption, alcohol-related disease, and alcohol-related mortality (Brennan et al., 2014; Holmes et al., 2014; Meier et al., 2016; Gill et al., 2017), there are several unintended consequences that should be considered prior to implementation.  First, MUP effectively establishes a floor price for alcohol, and for complete effectiveness, the MUP must be greater than the cost of production.  Over time, inflationary pressures will naturally increase the cost of production and purchase price of alcoholic beverages.  If MUP is not periodically re-calculated to factor in the effects of inflation, below-cost selling of alcohol is possible.  Second, although MUP may increase the majority of beer and malt beverages products included in the study, the  advertised  prices for a substantial minority  may actually  decrease.  Nearly all  advertised prices for  wine  may  also  decrease, subject to other economic pressures .  While numerous factors are involved in assigning a final sales price, MUPs overall effect on alcohol consumption and negative health consequences may be negated if average sales prices across all alcoholic beverage types remain stable."
"135" "Limitations"
"136" "There are several limitations to this study.   Although not a purpose of the study, a n economic analysis was not conducted ,  and research is needed on how  suppliers  will  endogenously adjust pricing, packaging, advertisements, quality, or their portfolio of sub-brands offered  under MUP.  Moreover, information was not collected on how MUP may effect supply and demand for alcoholic beverages, or whether a $1.18 MUP would significantly impact alcohol purchase behaviors or alcohol consumption.   The findings are  not intended to be representative,  and the introduction of  MUP may have greater or lesser e ffects elsewhere.   Finally, d aily fluctuations in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar were not taken into consideration."
"137" "Conclusions"
"138" "The implementation of MUP  in the northeast U.S.  that is similar in scale to the policy implemented in Scotland  c ould increase the advertised prices for the majority of beer and malt beverage products sold in the off-premise establishment monitored in this case study."
