The Role of Islam, Ajami writings and educational reform in Sulemaana Kant's N'ko
Coleman Donaldson
Abstract The written words of African Muslims have recently received renewed attention. This
stems from a push to go beyond colonial archives as well as concerns with terrorism and Islamic
radicalization. While Ajami—that is, writing African languages in Arabic-script—has been a
part of this trend, Manding-language publications in the N’ko script have been overlooked. And
yet, this literary industry is distinctly Islamic. Putting the writings of Sulemaana Kant5 into
conversation with historical authors and his contemporaries, Donaldson demonstrates that N’ko
represents an iteration of Afro-Muslim vernacular thought. He thereby illuminates Kant5 and a
body of N’ko and Ajami publications.

Sulemaana Kant5 is best known for his 1949 invention of a non-Latin-, non-Arabic-based
script named N’ko. A prolific author until his death from diabetes in 1987, he used his unique
script to write over 100 books—spanning across linguistics, history, traditional medicine and
Islam—which continue to be typeset and published today. Kant5's most enduring contribution,
however, is not his script nor any one of the many books that he authored using it. Instead, it is
the thousands of West Africans that dedicate themselves to the study and promotion of his
creation as either a pan-African script or a Manding orthography. Understanding what animates
the N’koïsants of today though is near impossible without a proper understanding of Kant5 as the
first N’ko kàramɔ́ɔ (ߐ
߮ ߡ ߊߙ ߊߞ ߏߞߒ)1 or ‘teacher.’
Scholarly accounts thus far (Amselle 2001; Oyler 2005; Wyrod 2003) have
underemphasized connections between the inventor of the N’ko alphabet and his historical and
contemporaneous Muslim counterparts in what post-colonially became “the Islamic sphere”
(Launay and Soares 1999). Kant5 was a particular iteration of what I call “the Afro-Muslim
vernacular tradition”. He emerged from the regional West African Quranic schooling network
and expressed similar sentiments to earlier Ajami intellectuals who sought to strengthen Islam
through literacy in local African languages. Like these predecessors, he faced skepticism—
though colored by his particular historical moment following World War II. Put broadly,
traditional scholars saw a new writing system and mother-tongue education as a threat to their
livelihoods, while rival reformers, the so-called Wahhabis, favored a pan-Islamic identity over
the Afro-centric one favored by Kant5 that melded pan-Africanism and ethno-nationalism.
In the following three sections, I focus on Kant5, the kàramɔ́ɔ, in the full Muslim clerisy
sense of the term. First, I introduce his upbringing in the Quranic schooling tradition of West
Africa. Second, I lay out parallels between him and predecessors in an Afro-Muslim tradition
which viewed vernacular writing in Arabic script (that is, Ajami) as a tool for both strengthening
Islam and responding to particular socio-political circumstances. Finally, I explore the specifics
of Kant5’s N’ko as an iteration of the above traditions influenced by the social forces that were
active following World War II and into the earlier years of independence.
Kant as a Product of the Afro-Muslim Vernacular Tradition
Born in 1922, in the Baté2 (ߍ
߫ ߕߊߓ bátɛ literally ‘between rivers’) region of what is now
Guinea, Kant5 was early on integrated into a religion—Islam—present in parts of sub-Saharan
West Africa since approximately the ninth century (Austen 2010:85–86; Tamari & Bondarev
2013:4; Ware III 2014:85). Like many West African Muslims before him, Kant5 was familiar
with the Arabic language (Hunwick 1964)—though his knowledge went much further—thanks
to both the centrality of Quranic verses to prayer and other religious acts. Kant5’s interest in the
written word was instilled in him and his eleven siblings from an early age. While none of them
would follow their father’s career path as a móri (ߌߙߏߡ ‘Quranic school teacher’ often used
interchangeably with ߐ
߮ ߡ ߊߙ ߊߞ kàramɔ́ɔ), they all, at one point or another, attended the school that
was their family’s livelihood3.
The vast majority of the elder Kant5’s students would have only attended Quranic school
at the first of two levels: the so-called basic level during which a student, for a span of time
ranging from a few months to a few years4, focuses on learning the “fundamental elements of
Islamic religious obligation,” such as the proper techniques for ritual ablution, prayer and the
recitation of at least some verses of the Quran (Brenner 2008:220). Given that Arabic is rarely
the mother tongue of West Africans, this early focus on the Quran inevitably entails some rote
memorization, but it is far from mindless as suggested in colonial documents (e.g., Mairot 1905
in Turcotte 1983); the elementary cycle itself is divided into numerous discrete stages5 before

students with sufficient mastery of Arabic move onto the second level with its focus on advanced
subjects of the Islamic Sciences.
Through this tradition and his father’s teaching, Kant5 came to master literary Arabic; a
language with a historical status akin to the Latin of West Africa (see Hunwick 2004). This
written lingua franca had spread not because of Arabic-speaking conquerors6, but rather, thanks
to the clerical efforts and unique status of Quranic teachers, or “walking Qurans” (Ware III
2014), who were free in many cases to travel and settle across West Africa for centuries prior to
colonial rule. These same scholars’ skills in Arabic literacy were also applied to the
administrative and communication needs of various West African polities and courts such as that
of Mali’s Mansa Musa in the fourteenth century7. Linguistic analysis has also long provided
evidence of this history of Arabic as a regional language of learning and correspondence (see
Green and Boutz 2016; Zappa 2011). Kant5 likely noted this early on in his education; later he
(2007/1958) would write:

Because all of Islam's worship is done in
Arabic, its legal books are in Arabic. This is
what has latched African Muslims to Arabic
to this day and this is also what proliferated
Arabic words in our languages in so many
ways. Presently, the amount of Arabic
[words] in the Mandings’ language is near
300 and some; it is almost 1% of the
language.

While his education took place primarily in Arabic, Kant5 reports having been introduced
formally to the practice of writing a sub-Saharan African language in Arabic script in 19418. In
this way, he was likely connected to an older tradition; the Bat5 region probably begun flirting
with writing their own language sometime in the nineteenth century9. Kant5, at the time however,
was not impressed. Presented with a history—written in Manding by his grandfather and
maternal uncle using the Arabic script—of the ethnic Fulani of the pre-colonial polities of Bat5
and neighboring Wasolon, he found that he could not read the text. His uncle’s remark that the
document served primarily as memory-jogging device for the author did little to convince Kant5
who recalled thinking:

Blinded, as he would later put it, to facts demonstrating that writing did not in fact stem from
God, Kant5 thought little more of writing African languages for the next few years (Sangaré
2011).
A number of other West Africans in the centuries before him had not come to the same
hasty conclusion. And while they did not arrive at his ultimate solution of inventing a script,
these Muslim scholars often had trajectories and ideas similar to those that Kant5 would later
develop regarding mother-tongue education.
Kant’s Desire to Strengthen Islam as Stemming from the Vernacular Ajami Tradition
Important initial academic scholarship on N’ko analyzes it as a primarily anti-colonial
intellectual movement10. Refining this work, Amselle (2001; 2003) rightfully highlights N’ko’s
connection with Islam and the wider Muslim world. On his account, however, N’ko is an ethnoreligious fundamentalist movement that utilizes the “invented tradition” (Ranger 2010) of French
colonial Islam noir (“Black Islam”12) to combat the efforts of West African Muslim Wahhabi
reformists (Kaba 1974; Brenner 2001) and thereby preserve “a ‘negro-african’ specificity within
the Muslim community” (Amselle 2003:257). His overly harsh positioning of N’ko activists as
fundamentalists aside, Amselle’s analysis does not properly situate Kant5’s thoughts and actions
within the West African Quranic tradition. Islam figures prominently in Kant5’s (2008a:7)13
characterization of his intellectual oeuvre and must be taken seriously:

First: Knowledge of Islam's worship
rituals and laws. This led me translate the
Quran and the Prophet's sayings into N’ko
because they are the key of the religion

Just as the script of Rome was eventually co-opted for penning a number of other
languages besides Latin, the Quranic tradition of Arabic literacy also lent itself to the
development of a written tradition for a large number of sub-Saharan African languages14.
Today, this tradition of writing local vernaculars in the Arabic script is commonly referred to in
West Africanist research as Ajami (from the Arabic ʿajam, ‫‘ عجم‬non-Arab, Persian’15). The

earliest evidence that we have of such literacy in the region dates back to the seventeenth century
when a scholar residing in the Kanem state north of Lake Chad inserted interlinear glosses of
Kanuri inside a copy of the Quran (Bondarev, 2013; Tamari & Bondarev, 2013). Existing
documents and research thus far suggest that it was during the eighteenth century that robust
traditions of Ajami began to emerge for a number of West African languages. In many cases,
Ajami was a “grassroots literacy” (Blommaert 2008) that existed in the Quranic schooling
system’s margins. In other cases, however, Ajami literacy was “undertaken by individual

scholars to solve language problems and modify the linguistic behaviours in West African
communities” (Diallo 2012:97). Such efforts to modify linguistic and literacy practices—as all
instances of language planning16 —were part and parcel of quests for social change. Analyzing
the voices of the Ajami tradition therefore allows us to better understand how Kant5 did not
simply co-opt French colonial Islam noir but rather innovated within a much longer tradition
expressed in, though not exclusive to, vernacular thought.
In what follows, I briefly sketch the intertwined emergence of Ajami literacy traditions in
four major West African languages of the Muslim Sahel17. See Figure 1 for a non-exhaustive
map of these language’s Ajami traditions and their relevant locales.
Fulani and Hausa
The eighteenth century gave rise to two regional traditions of Fulani Ajami in Fuuta Jaloo
(spelled Fouta-Djallon in French) and Hausaland, in modern-day Guinea and Nigeria
respectively (see Hunwick 2004; Zito 2012). In both cases the emergence of Ajami was tightly
connected to Fulani Jihads which aimed to spread Islam and gave rise to the aforementioned
polities.
In Fuuta Jaloo, the first known Ajami practitioner was Cerno Samba Mambeyaa (17551852) who explicitly justifies his decision to write in Fulani as follows:
I shall use the Fulfulde [Fulani] tongue to explain the dogma
In order to make their understanding easier: when you hear them, accept them!
For only your own tongue will allow you to understand what the Original texts say.
Among the Fulani, many people doubt what they read in Arabic and so remain in a state
of uncertainty
(Salvaing 2004:111–112)
To this end, Mambeyaa’s works were primarily religious texts written in verse form that may
have emulated the oral commentaries traditionally performed to the public by Fulani clerics
(Salvaing 2004:111–112). His innovation therefore was to believe that regular Fulani should
have access to these commentaries in written form. Such a shift, in his mind, would strengthen
Islam and spread religious fervor amongst the Fulani people. This goal remained central; at the
end of nineteenth century, all Fuuta Jaloo Ajami writings continued to focus on religious matters
(Salvaing 2004:112).
Similarly, Fulani Ajami emerged with Shaykh Usman Dan Fodio’s (1754-1817) rise to
power in establishing the nineteenth century Sokoto caliphate18 in what is now largely northern
Nigeria. Dan Fodio’s zeal to spread Islam amongst the general populace led to the flourishing of
both Fulani and eventually Hausa Ajami. While Dan Fodio himself wrote primarily in Arabic, he
did pen a number of original texts as well as translations of his Arabic works into Fulani, his
mother tongue, and Hausa, the dominant language of the conquered masses. Echoing
Mambeyaa’s concern with propagating Islam, Dan Fodio began one of his poems as follows:
My intention is to compose a poem on the [prostration] of forgetfulness
I intend to compose it in Fulfulde [viz. Fulani] so that Fulbe [viz. Fulani] could be
enlightened.
When we compose [a poem] in Arabic only the learned benefit.
When we compose it in Fulfulde the unlettered also gain (Diallo 2012:1)

Pre-print / "Submitted Manuscript Under Review" (2019-09-06)
Thus while learned discourse took place in written Arabic, Dan Fodio believed that
disseminating Islamic knowledge more broadly could be assisted by composing the kinds of
verses that had served to spread Islam orally in years prior19. This trend and encouragement from
Dan Fodio would give rise to a robust tradition of Fulani and increasingly Hausa Ajami that was
carried out by his disciples and those in his entourage such his brother as well as his daughter,
Nana Asm\’u (see Mack and Boyd 2000).
As evidenced by the declarations of both Dan Fodio and Mambeyaa, this evolution was
not an unquestioned natural progression. Indeed, local tradition suggests that Mambeyaa’s efforts
were opposed by Umar Tal (1794-1864), the leader of the first major Fulani jihad that took place
around the Senegal River’s region of Fuuta Tooro (see Salvaing 2004). Tal’s position along with
Fuuta Tooro’s proximity to the Moors of West Africa have also been advanced as reasons for the
lack of a robust Ajami tradition20 in this other major Fulani area (see Ngom 2009:101; Robinson
1982). This tension and its connection to race debates within Islam of West Africa emerge even
more strongly in the case of Wolof.
Wolof
The Ajami tradition of Wolof, commonly referred to as Wolofal, emerged primarily out of
the Sufi Muslim brotherhood, the Muridiyya (‫ المريدية‬al-murdyya), established by Shaykh
Amadu Bamba (1850-1927). Wolofal is still extensively practiced in Senegal today in both
formal publications and more mundane record-keeping, signs and correspondence (Ngom 2010).
Ngom (2009; 2016) suggests that the nineteenth century flourishing of Wolof Ajami can be
traced to the personality and teachings of Amadu Bambu. The Muriddiya's leader asserted a
strong African identity as part of his broader Islamic message; he addressed French colonialism
and its supposed superiority but he also “differentiated the essence of Islamic teaching from Arab
and Moorish cultural practices with no spiritual significance” (Ngom 2009:104). Bamba, for
instance, did not claim Sharifan21 or Arab descent for prestige or to legitimize his message.
While he did not write in Wolofal himself, he supported its development and use by his senior
disciples such as Muusaa Ka (see Camara 1997) who used it to spread Islam and Bamba’s
message to the masses. In this sense, Wolof Ajami emerged for the same reason as that of Fulani
and Hausa—to more effectively promote Islam and religious teachings. As Muusaa Ka explains
in the introduction to one of his poems:
The reason this poem—which should have been sacred—is written in Wolof
Is that I hope to illuminate the unknowing about his Lord (Camara 1997:170)
According to Ngom (2009), this aim is also connected to Bamba’s own desire for African
cultural autonomy. At least once in writing, Bamba explicitly engaged with the issue of race and
hierarchy within Islam; in his work Mas lik al-Jin n (‫‘ مسالك الجنان‬Itineraries of Heaven’) he
writes:

Do not let my condition of a black man mislead you about the virtue of this work,
because the best of man before God, without discrimination, is the one who fears him the
most, and skin color cannot be the cause of stupidity or ignorance (cited in Babou
2007:62)

Pre-print / "Submitted Manuscript Under Review" (2019-09-06)
From this position, Bamba (similarly to Kant5 in the twentieth century) had no qualms calling
upon traditions such as Wolof proverbs as a means to translate his Islamic message to the Wolof
masses (Ngom 2009:107). While he himself wrote in Arabic, perhaps because of a spiritual
desire to “commune with God and the prophet Muhammed” (Camara, 1997, p. 170), Bamba
articulated an explicit Afro-Muslim identity that gave “ideological and implementational space”
(Hornberger & Johnson, 2007) for local language Ajami literacy to flourish. This overt
engagement with issues of race and cultural autonomy within Islam makes the Wolofal tradition
seemingly unique, but ethnic relationships—mediated, today at least, in part by notions of race—
are alluded to in other accounts of Ajami literature's emergence (see Ngom 2009 for Fulani/Moor
and Robinson 1982 for Fulani/Manding).
Manding
Sulemaana Kant5 did not emerge directly from the Wolof, Hausa or Fulani traditions. He
grew up, however, in a place with close ties to the historical region, Màndén, which gave rise to
what historians refer to as the Mali empire22. While it is unclear what role Islam played amongst
this polity’s masses, we have evidence that Arabic was used both in Mali’s court and even
spoken by the empire’s sovereign, Mansa Musa, when he performed his pilgrimage to Mecca in
the fourteenth century (see Hunwick 1964). Nonetheless, a Friday prayer in Arabic was
translated spontaneously into Manding in the fourteenth century and therefore it seems likely that
the language was a developed medium of oral scholarly discussion and religious propagation by
the fifteenth century23.
The oldest tradition of Islam amongst Manding speakers seems to be traceable to the j#lá
network that originated first with Muslim Soninke traders that spread out across West Africa
during the Ghana empire that preceded that of Màndén (see Wilks 1968; Wilks 2000) (See
Figure 2). During the Mali empire, which reached its apogee in the fourteenth century, the
Muslim Jula network of traders became increasingly Manding; that is, older Soninke members
adopted the language of Mali and were additionally joined by other Manding-speaking Muslims
along their trading routes and outposts (see Massing 2000). Thus, while the decline of the Mali
empire led to many non-Muslim polities (e.g., Kaabu and Segu) where Ajami would have been
less likely to emerge24, we nonetheless find evidence of Manding Ajami traditions in a number of
areas (see Vydrin 1998; Vydrin 2014).
Specifically, the Islamic tradition of the Jakhanke25 Muslim clerics (a western iteration of
the Jula network) in southern Senegambia gave rise to Ajami that was attested to as early as the
late seventeenth century26. It is also in and around this Mandinka-speaking region that Manding
Ajami practices appear the strongest today. The earliest Western documentation27 of Manding
Ajami elsewhere stems primarily from areas in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. Vydrin (2014)
suggests that this was surely an area with an older Manding Ajami tradition. Indeed, this part of
the Jula network gave rise to the Kong Empire28 and its vaunted scholarly tradition. Any Ajami
documents that may have existed in Kong were destroyed when the town and its libraries were
sacked and burned by S_m`ri Tare29 in the late nineteenth century (see Fofana 1998; Person
1968; and also Peterson 2008). While we know of no major Ajami collections in zone today,
Ajami is still practiced in the margins of the Quranic schooling tradition (Donaldson 2013).
Outside of the western Jakhanke and Mandinka-speaking areas, it is only in the case of
Kant5’s native region around Kankan that we currently have any specific information on
potential pre-twentieth century Manding Ajami tradition. Kant5 considered himself the heir to
the work of Alfa Mahmud Kàbá30 (Condé 2008b:135; 2017:117). Popularly understood as a
skilled leader who unified the Bat5 region in the mid-nineteenth century, Kàbá was also a man of

letters. He is known for both works in Arabic as well as his (presumably oral) translation of
Islamic poems into Manding31. Condé (2008b) suggests he may have been the first to attempt to
pen Manding in the Arabic script. In the early twentieth century, a contemporary and friend of
Kant5’s father, Jakagbɛ Talibi Kaba32, was also concerned with translating Islamic rites and
poems into Manding and is purported to also have attempted to create a unique writing system
for Manding (Condé 2008b:135). Despite not having access to any texts33, with both of these
authors, we see that Manding Ajami arose alongside the Arabic-language tradition, in part, for
the purpose of spreading the gospel of Islam.
In sum then, just as West African speakers of Fulani, Hausa and Wolof pondered the place
of their mother-tongues in promoting Islam, so did Manding Muslims, despite a relative dearth of
identified Ajami textual artifacts in the major Eastern Manding varieties of Bamanan, Jula and
Maninka. Kant5 was a direct intellectual heir to Alfa Mahmud Kaba and Talibi Kaba of Kankan.
However, given the transnational character of Quranic schooling and clerical communities in
West Africa, it is important to see that Kant5 was also connected indirectly with thinkers
amongst Fulani, Hausa and Wolof Muslims etc. In this sense, we have severely underestimated
the role of Kant5’s Quranic education in his life and work:
In his reflection on the Manding language and his interest for its different regional
varieties, in his quest for a perfectly adequate vocabulary to express theological,
philosophical, logic or linguistic concepts, by strongly distinguishing between Islam and
Arabness, [Kant5] was pursuing preoccupations and manifesting points of view well
anchored amongst clerics [Fr. les lettrés] (Tamari 2006:51–52)
Kant’s Desire to Reform Islamic Education
N’ko’s founder was a particular iteration of the Afro-Muslim vernacular tradition. While
rooted in the ideas laid out above, Kant5 also sought to respond as a Muslim educator and intellectual to his own historical moment following World War II and into the independence era.
The aftermath of World War II "presented opportunities to political and social movements
to take on imperial administrations uncertain of their continued authority and aware of their need
of Africans’ contributions to rebuilding imperial economies" (Cooper 2002:26). The post-war
moment also revealed tensions in what Launay & Soares (1999:498) describe as the newly
formed Islamic sphere, “separate […] from ‘particular’ affiliations—ethnicity, kin group membership, ‘caste’ or slave origins, etc.— but also from the colonial (and later the post-colonial)
state.” While West African Muslims had undoubtedly always debated proper membership in the
Islamic community, it tended to be restricted to internal discussions amongst the largely hereditary clerical class. The colonial period’s major shifts in political economy disrupted such traditional religious authority and carved out space for larger societal debates about Islam and Muslim identity (Launay & Soares 1999:501). As such, as elsewhere on the Continent (Brenner &
Last 1985; Petersen 2006), the postwar moment in French West Africa gave rise to unique and
competing Muslim experimentations with language-in-education that were designed to address
both the French colonial system as well as concerns in the Islamic sphere.
Kant5’s father, Amara, was likely at the origin of the N’ko inventor’s interest in pedagogical reform; the elder Kant5 was himself an innovator. His instructional methods facilitated an accelerated program which attracted a large body of Manding-speaking students with origins
spread out across West Africa (Sangaré 2011; Oyler 2005).

Sulemaana took responsibility for teaching his father’s students following his father’s
death in 1941 (Sangaré 2011:10-11). By 1942 though he had decided to seek his fortune away
from home and left with the intention to settle either with “people looking for a Quranic teacher”
or in “one of the White man’s cities” (Sangaré 2011:12-13; see also Amselle 2001:150; see Figure 3 for a map of Kant5’s travels within his broader life).
Kant5’s decision was typical; many young male Sahelian Muslims (oftentimes Mandingspeakers) at the time were drawn to the economic opportunities of southern Côte d’Ivoire. For
Kant5, it was in the city of Bouaké that the invention of N’ko was set in motion:

One day, sitting at the marketplace in
Bouaké, I saw some book for sale with
something about African stupidity on it. Its
writer was from Lebanon and named
Kamal Maruwa [Kamal Marwa]. He was
saying that African ignorance never ends.
He said, first, none of their languages can
be written; they aren’t made according to
any grammar. They aren’t meant for
writing; they were made for speaking only.
They don’t actually have a true language,
just dialects that no intelligent person
would waste their time thinking about
writing. Lots of Europeans have become
interested in writing African languages, but
there is just no way. He said, teaching us
European languages is easier than teaching
us our own languages (Sangaré 2011:16)

It was true, Kant5 said, Africans don’t have a writing system34, but it was insult to injury to
spread the lie that their languages were deprived of grammar. His rancor drove him to attempt to
write Manding (Sangaré 2011:17-18).
Likely equally important and not sufficiently taken into account in previous analyses,
however, are the voices of his fellow Manding-speaking Muslims that he encountered during the
same period. The town where he encountered Marwa’s book, was central to the post-War
madrasa35 movement, which established a string of modernist Muslim schools that used Arabic
as the medium of instruction but followed the curriculum and practices of Western-style francophone schools. Bouaké opened its first madrasa school as early as 1948 (Leblanc 1999:492).
Such schools were the product, on one hand, of so-called Wahhabi doctrinal reformists that connected during or upon return from sojourns in the Middle East (Kaba 1974) and, on the other, of
educational reformists simultaneously questioning the traditional Quranic schooling elite and
seeking to prepare students in a Muslim manner for integration into the emerging modern economy (Brenner 1991:65). Their Arabic language policy stemmed in part from a prevalent rationalist tenant in modernist Islamic circles “that texts are transparent and that grasping their manifest
meaning makes their prescriptions clear" (Ware 2014: 70).
While any specific encounters with educational reformists or preachers such as Al-Hajj
Tiekodo Kamagaté (to whom Kaba [1974] traces the origin of so-called West African Wahhabi
reformism) remain undocumented, Kant5 was unquestionably a part of the rising younger generColeman Donaldson (coleman.donaldson@gmail.com)

ation of so-called j#lá traders in Côte d'Ivoire who were hearing and debating new ideas about Islam and society. For reformists such as Kamagaté, madrasas offered both popular access to Islam
through Arabic acquisition in schooling and a means to short-circuit the elite role traditionally
played by Quranic teachers as religious intermediaries. Unsurprisingly those behind this shift to
Arabic were also frequently engaged in larger doctrinal critiques of traditional Sufi clerics at the
top of the Quranic schooling system (Kaba, 1974).
Shortly after encountering Kamal Marwa’s tract, Kant5 headed south, eventually settling
in Bingerville where he set up shop as a Quranic teacher before entering the Kola nut trade. His
free time was dedicated to devising a way to write Manding (Sangaré 2011:19). N’ko students
today largely attribute this quest to the ignorant, if not racist, ignorance of Marwa. However, analyzing Kant5’s own writings regarding the reactions of fellow Quranic scholars reveals the extent to which his activities were also an attempt to intervene in the Islamic context of both
Quranic schools and newly-formed madrasas.
For three years, he initially experimented with writing Manding with the Arabic script.
His efforts were discouraged by those affiliated with Quranic schooling [ ߐ

They [clerics] themselves are always saying
"May God strengthen Islam." This
strengthening has come in the shortcut of
writing. What is their reason for refusing if
they are serious about strengthening the
religion?

He subsequently spent two years experimenting with the Latin script, before ultimately
concluding that to forge this shortcut, he must create a unique writing system with conventions
adapted to the tonal and vowel lengthening systems of West African languages such as
Manding36.
On April 14, 1949, while residing in Bingerville, Côte d’Ivoire, Sulemaana Kant5, after
five years of experimentation, unveiled the non-Arabic-, non-Latin-based script of 28 characters
written right-to-left that he called N’ko37. He would subsequently dedicate the rest of his life to
research, writing and teaching using his so-called African Phonetic Alphabet. Similarly to the
madrasa movement, Kant5's act was part of a rationalist project, as revealed in his many writings
as "an Enlightenment-style encyclopediast" (Vydrine 2001:100; also Conrad 2001). This is most
evident in his translation of the Quran (see Davydov 2012) which if taken as legitimate removes
the need for an Arabic-proficient Quranic teacher to school oneself in Islam. In this respect, N'ko
and the madrasa movement therefore were sister reform projects of democratizing access to
much of the Islamic knowledge of the traditional Quranic schooling system.

To Kant5’s mind, his attempts to develop an appropriate way of writing his mother-tongue
would spread Islam and its proper practice. As such, he did not shy away from presenting it to
the Quranic elite. Unfortunately, their reaction was the same as when they reviewed his Ajami
orthographies. Kant5 (2004:5–6), in response, invoked the life and acts of the Prophet
Muhammad:

Once the N’ko alphabet was shown to
clerical people, they also said “What?! An
alphabet that God didn't send down.” In
their mind, God sent the Arabic alphabet
down to the Prophet, when in fact the
Prophet himself didn't know any writing
system before the revelation of the Quran.
The Prophet didn't learn any script, but he
recited the Quran because God had him
do so. Of the 10 pagans caught during the
Battle of Badir, the Prophet took the
learned ones, made them teach reading
and writing to the illiterate Muslims of
Madina and [thereby] made instruction
their k#nká [tribute/price of freedom].
Those that didn't teach people each had to
pay a tribute in gold of 1 kilo and 600
grams.

For Kant5, this act of Muhammad was important evidence of the Islamic responsibility to spread
literacy. To his mind, however, literacy should not be sought out in just any language. Working
towards an Islamic conclusion about translation and mother-tongue education, Kant5 (2004:6)
called upon the holy book itself:

Scholars even see it in Sura 14, Line 4: “We
haven't sent a Prophet in any other language
but the language of his people so that he can
explain things to them.” Aha! How can they
deliver the word of God to their kin if they
do not say it in the fatherland's language?

Of course, Islam for centuries has been relayed to West Africans through the Quranic schooling
tradition as outlined above. To Kant5’s mind though, oral explanation to the masses was simply
not sufficient. It would not necessarily generate that which was central to embracing Islam—
understanding (Kántɛ 2004:6):

Kant5 held that being a good Muslim requires understanding—something that he believed is
most easily achieved through mother-tongue education—but true understanding requires textmediated learning. Indeed, writing occupies much the same role in Kant5’s theory of

Writing is putting the signs of speech on
paper with pen and ink. The individual
signs’ names are letters. An alphabet is all of
one language’s letters put together. Almost
every language has a particular alphabet.
But, nowadays many languages are grouped
together under one alphabet. Writing
clarifies language, supports thought, and
promotes knowledge. For this reason, no
intelligent person thrives without writing
nowadays.

Combining this pedagogical perspective regarding mother-tongue education, his theory of the
written word’s power and his conceptualization of the role of understanding in spreading Islam,
Kant5 (2004:6) came to the following conclusion:

All of this thus shows that ever since the time
of Islam’s arrival in our lands, Islamic
scholars [móri] should have written our
languages and explained [the] religion in

N’ko’s founder did not call for an end to Arabic literacy & proficiency (or that of French for that
matter); for him, it was undoubtedly the language of Islam (Kántɛ 2008b:4). Nonetheless, given

that few African Muslims understand it, Kant5 (2004:6) questioned how realistic it was to focus
on Arabic acquisition instead of mother-tongue education:

“How will the religion be understood in a mothertongue [fàsó’ kán’] if it isn’t written? Or will everyone
[need to] become Arabic proficient in order to
[kànató] understand the religion?”

This commentary about Arabic proficiency presupposes the voices of his interlocutors of
the day: Madrasa reformers who were actively working to promote Arabic-language instruction
as the best way forward for West African Muslims. By the 1950s, Manding Muslim society was
polarized and people had to take a stance vis-à-vis the reform movement (Kaba 1974:50). Kant5,
like his fellow Muslims and Quranic teachers, hoped to strengthen and spread Islam; N'ko would
contribute to that (Kántɛ 2004:1). That said, he explicitly distanced himself from certain voices
within West African Islam:

Where we are from, most people who master the
Arabic language are religious fanatics [d)ina-fatɔ l#,
lit. 'crazy religious people'], they only want to write in
Arabic about religious affairs, and anything that is
written on other things is considered by them as
paganism
(Kántɛ 2008b:4)

Such remarks placed alongside his own extensive writings on Manding history, customs and
Islam suggest Kant5’s N’ko was a direct intervention in the emergent "Islamic sphere" of West
Africa and not only a reaction to Marwa’s racism or colonial injustice. Kant5’s N’ko writings
suggest goals similar to those undergirding the madrasa movement: unmediated access to God
(Kántɛ 2007:1) and Islam without the distortions introduced by man (Kántɛ 2008:4).
Nonetheless, as the above and his many non-Islamic writings make clear, he also acted in
response to the numerous reformist or “Wahhabi” voices that he undoubtedly encountered and
likely viewed as committed to the further Arabization of West Africa (see allusions to this in
Oyler 2005:40,73).
Clearly, Kant5's intervention cannot be limited to the Islamic sphere. N’ko and the
madrasa movement both used medium of instruction as a means to simultaneously reform
Quranic schooling and undermine French colonialism. If, amongst other things, the madrasa
movement sought to use Arabic to re-insert West Africa into a global Islamic community, what
did Kant5 seek in promoting mother-tongue education for Manding speakers?
While clearly Islamic on one hand, his focus on mother-tongue orthography and
standardization along with his writings on Manding history and culture tie it to other ethnonationalist rumblings of the late colonial era on the other. In Guinea of the 1940s, prior to the rise
of the pan-French West Africa party, the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, “[t]he political
arena was dominated by regional and ethnic associations promoting the interests of their
particular constituencies: Peul, Malinke [viz. Manding], Susu, and the people of the forest
region” (Schmidt 2005:33). N’ko can be understood as an intellectual counterpart to the relevant
ethnic association of Kant5’s home region of Upper Guinea, the Union du Mandé (d’Avignon
2012:10). This is not to say that Kant5 was commissioned by or working directly for the group;

these sort of connections would have been difficult given that Kant5 spent most of the 1940s in
Côte d’Ivoire. Even following independence, Kant5 never seems to have been directly involved
with politics whether in Guinea, Mali (1977-1982) or Côte d’Ivoire (1982-1984). Regardless of
this lack of connections with political parties pre- or post-independence, his writings on Manding
language, history and traditions were certainly works that could “foster coherence and selfconsciousness” (Cooper 2002:59) amongst Manding people as Oyler (2005) and Wyrod (2003)
argue.
In sum, Kant5’s N’ko was an intellectual project that straddled two seemingly disparate
worlds: that of Islam, and that of worldly political concerns pursued through ethno-nationalism
or pan-Africanism. Kant5 was not simply a cultural nationalist who happened to be a Quranic
teacher though. His actions and accomplishments were unique, but his goal of valorizing African
and specifically Manding ways of being while also affirming equal status within the global
Muslim community was not. It was long present in West African intellectual circles, as evident
in the Ajami tradition reviewed in the previous section.
Conclusion
Kant5’s legacy lives on today through the grassroots publishing, broadcasting and
education efforts of thousands of his West African students. Together, they undoubtedly produce
more printed text in a year than in all of the official State-backed Latin-based orthographies for
Manding combined. Where does such support stem from? We can usefully begin to respond to
this question through the life and work of N’ko’s intellectual forefather as analyzed above.
First, the inventor of the N’ko script was firmly rooted within the “discursive tradition”
of Islam (Asad 1986). His writing system was unique, but his concern with using a local African
language to better spread the religion was not. Following in the footsteps of Fulani, Hausa,
Wolof and Manding West African Muslims that arose starting at least two centuries before him,
he believed that African languages had an integral role to play in disseminating Islam. While
these languages and Manding had long been used orally to this end, Kant5, like Samba
Mambeyaa, Usman Dan Fodio, Muusaa Ka and Alfa Mahmud Kaba, saw the benefit of reading
and writing in them. Indeed, for Kant5, literacy was not just essential to learning and logical
thought but also an Islamic responsibility that could be traced back to God’s Messenger,
Muhammad. Despite this sentiment and his Islamic scholarship, Kant5 never claimed the mantle
of a religious leader. From the inventor of N’ko’s perspective, his contribution in the Islamic
domain was primarily a pedagogical one.
Second, Kant5’s intervention spoke to his historical moment and the future he envisioned
for society. Traveling and living directly amidst the reformist circles that were gaining steam in
the Manding-speaking areas of Mali, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire, Kant5’s orthographic
experimentations that culminated in the invention of N’ko in 1949 were his mother-tongue
response to the madrasa movement’s championing of Arabic-medium education. In this sense,
Kant5’s actions and his subsequent thirty-eights years of writing, research and teaching were not
only responses to Kamal Marwa and French colonialism, but to his Islamic sphere
contemporaries. N’ko as his oeuvre then is also an important example of an Islamically-educated
African doing the same intellectual work around ethnic solidarity that is often seen as emanating
from “the first or second generation of western-educated people” (Cooper 2002:59); the
implication being that such sympathies were in large part fanned by the Western institutions
behind them: churches, colonial officers and schools etc.
Kant5—and therefore the N’ko movement of today—must be understood as Islamic in
addition to any readings of anti-colonial, pan-Africanist or ethno-nationalist.

Notes
2 The term kàramɔ́ɔ has a range of one-to-one equivalents: Wolof sëri[, Fulani ceerno, Soninke
móod\ (< Ar. muʾaddib ‘educator’, Baldi 2008:42). Today many translate it with the French colonial term marabout (< Ar. mur\bit ‘holy ascetic’).
Here, I use the common Latin-based spelling kàramɔ́ɔ instead of a strict transliteration of
the N'ko spelling. When writing Manding in Latin script, I use phonemic orthography synthesizing the various national standards while also marking tone. Grave diacritics mark low tones and
acute diacritics mark high tones. An unmarked vowel carries the same tone as the last marked
vowel before it. The tonal article on nouns is noted by an apostrophe but not in citation.
