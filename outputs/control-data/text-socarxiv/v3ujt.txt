Abstract:
The objectives of this study were to determine the most frequent type of translation shifts according
to Catford’s model of translation shifts in the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of
the Child (1989) from English into Arabic and to examine the inevitability of resorting to
translation shifts in legal texts. To conduct the analysis, the researcher selected a sample covering
the preamble and the three main parts of the Convention representing legal texts in general.
Throughout the analysis, every translation shift was traced and manually counted to identify the
most frequent type of translation shifts. The inevitability of each of the identified shifts was
examined to conclude how necessary translation shifts were to preserve the meaning and effect of
the source text. The findings indicated that intra-system shifts were the most frequent type of shifts
with the frequency of 174 shifts (=26.6%), followed by unit shifts scoring 171 shifts (=26.3%), then
structure shifts with the frequency of 161 shifts (=24.6%), then class shifts being identified 128
times (=19.6%), and finally level shifts with the frequency of 19 shifts (=2.9%). Regarding the
inevitability of resorting to translation shifts, 80.1% (=523 cases) of identified translation shifts
were obligatory due to the linguistic disparities between English and Arabic. Only 19.9% of
detected (=130 cases) were optional due to the technicality of legal texts. Finally, exposure of
translators to legal texts was recommended to understand the linguistic and stylistic characteristics
of English and Arabic legal texts and to maintain the meaning in the TT.

according to Catford’s model of translation shifts in the translation of the UN’s Convention on
the Rights of the Child (1989) from English into Arabic and to examine the inevitability of
resorting to translation shifts in legal texts. To conduct the analysis, the researcher selected a

Chapter One: Introduction
1.1 Background of the Study
All living species use different ways to communicate with one another to express
feelings and send messages. For human beings, language is the means through which they share
emotions and exchange ideas. According to Sapir (1921), “Language is a purely human and
non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a system
of voluntarily produced symbols.” So, language is not innate; it is an acquired tool from the
surrounding culture to achieve communication within human beings who share the same
language. Moreover, unlike other species which use a universal kind of communication,
humans across the globe use various distinct languages that characterize each culture to
communicate with other people speaking the same language.
Because people around the world speak various languages, miscommunication occurs
when two parties speaking different languages attempt to communicate. This highlights the
significance of the craft of translation to bridge this communicational gap. Many linguists
proposed diverse definitions for the term ‘translation’. In his book Toward a Science of
Translating, Nida (1964) defines translation as “the transference of a message from one
language to another” (p.3). He explains that translation is a process of replacing words in a
language with words in another language to achieve communication and deliver the intended
meaning.
Since ancient times, people speaking various languages from different cultures and
backgrounds came into contact through trade, Hajj, immigration, wars, and other reasons.
Therefore, translation was needed to explain other people’s verbal or written messages. Ever
since then, translation became widely employed in all fields and interests such as science,
politics, trade, and law. Moreover, each field of translation is characterized by its own
properties and stylistic features marking its register.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

As concerned in the present research, legal translation is an area that deals with not only
two distinct languages but distinct legal systems as well. Šarčević (1997) defines legal
translation as "a translation from one legal system into another─ from the source legal system
into the target legal system" (p. 13). From this definition, legal language is “very much a
system-bound language, i.e. a language related to a specific legal system” (Groot & van Laer,
2006, p. 173). Accordingly, English legal language is unique because of its numerous special
features reflecting the decisiveness and significance of its content.
The presence of special peculiarities in a specific type of translation poses difficulties
on the rendition process from the source into the target language leading to the occurrence of
structural and lexical alterations to maintain the meaning. Such alterations are firstly referred
to by John Catford (1965) as ‘translation shifts.’ He defines ‘shifts’ as the “departures from
formal correspondence in the process of going from the SL to the TL” (p. 73). He explains that
translation shifts take place in the absence of ‘formal correspondence’, which he defines as
‘any TL category which can be said to occupy, as nearly as possible, the same place in the
economy of the TL as the given SL category occupies in the SL” (Catford, 1965, p. 32).
Since this study focuses on English and Arabic languages, formal correspondence
between these two languages hardly exists because they belong to different language families.
English belongs to the Indo-European family whereas Arabic belongs to the Semitic family
(Algeo, 2010). Each language family differs in linguistic structures, making it nearly
impossible to find absolute correspondents or ‘formal equivalence’ to every single word
between these two languages. Nida and Taber (2004) argue that “Formal correspondence
distorts the grammatical and stylistic patterns of the receptor language, and hence distorts the
message, so as to cause the receptor to misunderstand or to labour unduly hard” (p: 201).

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

16

To resolve the problem of the absence of formal correspondence between languages
belonging to different families, translation shifts can be applied to preserve the meaning and
structure while transferring a text from the source language into the target language. In this
research, the researcher applied Catford’s types of translation shifts, i.e. level shifts and
category shifts, to analyze the official translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the
Child (1989) from English into Arabic. The researcher aimed at determining the types of
translation shifts applied to resolve the linguistic differences between English and Arabic.
1.2 Statement of the Problem
Legal translation is categorized as ‘specialist’ translation because it is concerned with
the use of a particular register (i.e., law) (Cao, 2007; Stolze, 2013). Accordingly, translation
can be challenging when the language used has special peculiarities and properties such as the
legal register (Bázlik, 2009). Furthermore, problematic issues arise in translating legal texts
because "this type of translation is burdened with both intricacies of literary translations and
technicalities of scientific translations" (Sakareva, 2001, p. 133). For that reason, translators
are more likely to fail in finding similar equivalents at various levels, particularly the linguistic
level as English and Arabic are dissimilar in sentence structure and grammar. This study aimed
to address the problem of finding appropriate equivalents on the linguistic level in the
translation of legal texts from English into Arabic.
1.3 Objectives of the Study
This study intended to find the most frequently used types of shifts in the translation of
the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child to overcome the linguistic differences between
English and Arabic. Additionally, this research sought to determine how inevitable resorting
to translation shifts in legal texts is.

1.4 Significance of the Study
Many studies on the application of Catford's shifts to the translation of different text
types have been conducted. Nevertheless, studies focusing on the application of Catford's shifts
to legal contexts are relatively insufficient. Hence, this paper was designed to fill the literature
gap in regard to legal translation. Additionally, this study aimed to benefit to translation
students, professional translators, and translation scholars alike as it shed light on the different
types of shifts that occur in the process of translating legal texts as to solve the problems of
non-equivalence and untranslatability.
1.5 Questions of the Study
This paper was intended to answer the following questions:
1. What are the most frequently recurrent types of translation shifts according to Catford's
model in translating the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) from
English into Arabic?
2. To what extent is resorting to translation shifts inevitable to maintain the meaning and
effect in the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) from
English into Arabic?
1.6 Scope and Limitation of the Study
This study was limited to the official Arabic translation of the UN’s Convention on the
Rights of the Child (1989) published by the United Nations as a representative of legal texts.
The study was also limited to the types of translation shifts proposed by John Catford.
1.7 Methods and Procedures
This study adopted a descriptive content-analysis approach to investigate which types
of translation shifts occur in the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

18

(1989), as a representative of legal texts, from English into Arabic. The researcher applied
Catford’s translation shifts as a research model to be applied to answer the research questions.
The researcher selected a sample of around 400 words from each of the four main parts
of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (i.e. the preamble and the three sections) due
to the limitation of the study. All shifts and alterations on sentence and phrase levels were
traced and manually counted to identify the types of Catford’s translation shifts taking place in
legal texts, in addition to the most frequently recurrent type of translation shifts.
1.8 Definition of terms
Translation shifts
In his book, A Linguistic Theory to Translation, Catford (1965) introduced his typology
of translation shifts, which was his major contribution to the field of translation theory. For
such contribution, Catford is known to be the ‘Father of Translation Shifts’ (Al-Hamed, 2016).
He refers to ‘shifts’ as the “departures from formal correspondence in the process of going
from the SL to the TL” (p. 73). Catford (1965) introduced two major types of translation shifts,
namely ‘level shifts’ and ‘category shifts.’ Category shifts are subdivided into four types,
namely structure shifts, class shifts, unit shifts and intra-system shifts. All are subsequently
defined in this section.
Level Shifts
Catford (1965) defined level shifts as the changes that take place when “an SL item at
one linguistic level has a TL equivalent at a different level;” i.e., grammar in the source
language is expressed using a word in the target language or vice versa.
Structure Shifts
According to Catford (1965), structure shifts are “amongst the most frequent category
shifts at all ranks in translation” (p. 77). They are the changes in the grammatical structure, i.e.,
word order, of a sentence at any linguistic rank (i.e., phrases, clauses, and sentences).

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

19

Class Shifts
According to Catford (1965), a class shift occurs “when the translation equivalent of an
SL item is a member of a different class from the original item” (p. 78).
Unit Shifts
According to Catford (1965), “By unit-shift we mean changes in rank─ that is,
departures from formal correspondence in which the translation equivalent of a unit at one rank
in the SL is a unit at a different rank in the TL” (p. 79).
Intra-system Shifts
Intra-system shifts are the changes that occur when the “translation involves selection
of a non-corresponding term in the TL system,” (Catford, 1965, p. 80).
UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)
As cited in Unicef (n. d.),
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or UNCRC, is the basis of all
of Unicef’s work. It is the most complete statement of children’s rights ever produced and is the
most widely-ratified international human rights treaty in history. (para. 1-2)

1.9 Study Outline
In this part, the researcher explained the structure of the study. The first chapter
presented the framework of the study. The statement of the problem was explained and the
objectives to be met are presented. Moreover, the significance of conducting the present study
and the limitation of the paper were presented. In addition, the research questions to be
answered and the methods and procedures to be followed throughout the study were described
and explained. Finally, the definition of key terms and concepts was provided to establish a
clear foundation for the study.
In the second chapter, the literature of the study was reviewed and presented to
constitute the theoretical part of the study and to provide a comprehensive image of relevant

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

20

areas to the present paper. This section tackled the nature of both English and Arabic legal
languages, legal translation, problems and difficulties in legal translation, Catford's typology
of translation shifts, and previous relevant studies.
The third chapter revolved around the methodology of the study. It mainly discussed
the detailed steps followed by the researcher throughout the study to answer the research
questions and meet the objectives of the study. It also touched upon the study data and how it
was collected and analyzed.
In chapter four, the researcher analyzed the translation of the UN’s Convention on the
Rights of the Child. Each type of translation shifts was discussed solely and supported by
examples for explanation.
Last but not least, chapter five provided answers for the research questions based on
the analysis of the study. Recommendations and suggestions for future research were also
provided for in this chapter.

Chapter Two: Literature Review
2.1 Introduction
In this chapter, the theoretical framework of the study was demonstrated to draw a
comprehensive image in regard to the key concepts highlighted in this research. The main
topics were the nature of both English and Arabic legal languages, legal translation, problems
and difficulties in legal translation, Catford's typology of translation shifts, and previous
relevant studies. The literature review section was designed to provide an in-depth review of
relevant studies to thesis topic and to reflect an up-to-date status of the abovementioned topics.
2.2

Nature of Legal Language
There is a distinction between the standard daily used language and the legal language

that is used in courts and legal documents. According to Cao (2007), legal language is defined
as “a variety of language appropriate to the legal situation of use” (p. 9). Legal language is
“very much a system-bound language, i.e., a language related to a specific legal system”
(Groot & van Laer, 2006, p. 173). Accordingly, legal language, whether English or Arabic, is
distinct from any other technical language as it is characterized by various special features
reflecting the decisiveness and gravity of its content. Legal language tends to be
communicatively restricted; in other words, it is limited in use to the legal jargon and legal
specialists (Crystal & Davy, 1969).
2.2.1 English Legal Language
The English language used in legal contexts is different from the daily used English
language; it has some special features and characteristics related to its jargon. Regarding the
layout and style of English legal texts, Tiersma (1999) highlighted the eloquent and literary
nature of legalese as an influence of the Anglo-Saxons. He also shed light on the use of
alliteration (i.e., words starting with the same sound) in legal contexts not only for poetic
reasons but also to make these words easy to remember.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

22

According to Al-Nakhalah (2013), Slapper and Kelly (2009), and Danet (1985), legal
language uses long, complex sentences to provide all necessary information and hence avoid
ambiguity or any possible miscomprehension. Moreover, legal texts are characterized by the
scarce use of punctuation marks making it not easily understood by non-specialized people in
the legal jargon (Muriçi, 2016). Another distinctive feature of English legal language is that it
tends to be ‘formulaic.’ In other words, it comprises “technical terms, common words with
uncommon meaning, archaic expressions, doublets, formal items, unusual prepositional
phrases, high frequency of any” (Trosborg, 1997, p. 13).
On the syntactic level, passive voice is highly used in legalese “to obscure the agent, to
focus on a part that the author sees as more prominent, and to foreground a fact by leaving it
unspecified” (El-Farahaty, 2015, p. 23). The abundant use of nominalization is also one of the
typical features of legal texts. It is “a noun phrase that has a systematic correspondence with a
clausal prediction which includes a head noun morphologically related to a corresponding
verb” (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985, p. 1288). The utilization of conditional
and prepositional phrases such as ‘provided that’ and ‘subject to’ are among the distinct
syntactic features of legal discourse (Alcaraz & Hughes, 2014; El-Farahaty, 2015).
The English legal language is also characterized by the use the formulaic modal
auxiliary verb shall in a law-specific sense. In standard English, ‘shall’ indicates the future
sense. In legal discourse, however, it is “used in the imperative sense to impose a duty or
obligation on the legal subject to whom it refers” (Bhatia, Candlin, & Gotti, 2003, p.347). The
use of the modal auxiliary shall dates back to the Roman legal texts (Šarčević, 1997). Triebel
(2009) argued that lawyers use shall excessively without considering its correct usage in legal
contexts, which, indeed, leads to confusion and ambiguity. According to Bhatia, Candlin, and
Gotti (2003), the verb may is the second most frequently used modal auxiliary verb in legal

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

23

texts. In this contexts, Foley (2002) explained that the verb may denotes both permission and
possibility because “you can only give permission to something possible” (p. 364).
On the lexical level, English legal language is marked by the distinct use of law-specific
and technical terms that can only be understood by law specialists. Since the technical terms
of the law are system-bound, these terms can be challenging in translation or even
untranslatable (Alcaraz & Hughes, 2014). The use of archaic words that are no longer used in
daily language also prevails in English legal language. The archaic words such as hereby and
aforesaid date back to Old and Middle English and remain effective today in the legal language
(El-Farahty, 2015). A movement towards ‘Plain English’ calls for simplifying the complex,
outdated legal vocabulary to be easily understood by everyone today (Fakhouri, 2008; Tiersma,
1999).
The use foreign words is prominent in English legal language. The rule of the Roman
Church in the Middle Ages led to the existence of Latin words such as ipso facto and bona fide
in English legal language as Latin was the language of writing at that time (Alcaraz & Hughes,
2014; Tiersma, 1999). English terms borrowed from French after the Norman Conquest are
also used in the legal discourse such as purchase and court (Alcaraz & Hughes, 2014). The
formal register is a typical feature of legalese and is reflected by the use of formal terms and
phrases such as your honor and your majesty (El-Farahty, 2015). Finally, culture-specific
words (e.g., Privy Council), religious terms (e.g., in the name of God), doublets (e.g., by and
between), and triplets (e.g., obey, observe and comply with) are used as well in English legal
language (El-Farahty, 2015).
2.2.2 Arabic Legal Language
Every legal language is influenced by the legislative system it follows and adopts. For
the Arabic language, the classical Islamic Law Sharia and foreign laws are the two main factors

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

24

influencing the legal language (Bostanji, 2010). The Sharia is composed of Islamic laws
derived from the two basic Islamic sources, the Holy Quran and the Sunnah, and is employed
in all living matters ranging from daily habits to economy and trade (Bostanji, 2010). Other
international and foreign laws also play a major role in the Arabic legal language and are used
to govern global relations and interactions (Bostanji, 2010).
Hatim argued in the Third Conference of the Said Association of Translation and
Arabization in 2009 that “there is no well-defined register of legal discourse in Arabic” (as
cited in El-Farahaty, 2015). Emery (1989), on the contrary, stated that:
Arabic legal texts exhibit their own features of structure and style. They make more use of
grammatical cohesion (through reference and conjunction) and of finite structures than their
English counterparts, and less use of passives. In addition, they are not characterized by the use of
archaic vocabulary and morphology. The two languages differ in their patterns of nominisation,
creation of binominals and in their use of highlighting and text markers. (p. 10)

In an attempt to better understand the special nature and peculiarities of Arabic legal
texts, El-Farahaty (2015) classified the Arabic legal features into three categories: lexical,
syntactic, and textual. Bostanji (2010) and Fakhouri (2008) also presented a similar
classification of Arabic legal language features as the former classified them into semantic,
syntactic, and stylistic while the latter categorized them into syntactic, lexical, and discourselevel.
On the lexical level, culture-specific and religious expressions inspired by the Islamic
Law, such as ‫بعون هللا‬, are among the unique features of Arabic legal language (El-Farahaty,
2015). Furthermore, doublets and triplets, such as ‫تعلن وتصرح‬, are redundant synonyms or
antonyms utilized in Arabic legal texts to serve as an emphasis (El-Farahaty, 2015; Fakhouri,
2008). Another similar feature to English legal language is the extensive use of introductory

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

25

statements and formal expressions to address high-status persons, such as ‫( صاحب السمو‬ElFarahaty, 2015). El-Farahaty (2015) also highlighted the use of masculine terms, such as
‫المستأجر‬, to indicate gender-neutrality in Arabic legal documents.
On the Syntactic level, Arabic legal language, similar to the English legal language,
tends to use long, complex sentences by employing both coordinated clauses and embedded
and relative clauses to avoid vagueness and misinterpretation (Al-Nakhalah, 2013; Emery,
1989). While written legal tend to be nominal in nature, written legal Arabic is mostly verbal
(Bostanji, 2010). Unlike English legal language, Arabic language, in general, favors the use of
active voice to avoid ‘obscurity of agents’ and to provide precision and clarity (El-Farahaty,
2015).
On the textual level, lexical redundancy is one of the typical features of Arabic legal
texts. According to Fakhouri (2008), “Arabic legal language displays a larger tendency to serve
lexical cohesion in the form of repetition of the same lexical item, much more than English
legal language” (p. 28). Another textual feature of Arabic legal language is the use of
pronominal reference to achieve textual cohesion (El-Farahaty, 2015; Fakhouri, 2008).
2.3

Legal Translation
Legal translation is increasingly demanded due to globalization and the growing

number of international organizations (Bostanji, 2010). Legal translation is a specialized
translation as it deals with a particular field of knowledge, i.e., law. Legal translation involves
a wide range of legal documents ranging from birth certificates and wills to contracts and
international conventions. Many definitions of legal translation have been proposed. Šarčević
(1997) defined legal translation as "a translation from one legal system into another─ from the
source legal system into the target legal system" (p. 13). Similarly, Brooks (2015) stated that
“the term legal translation refers to the translation of any text used within the legal system"

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

26

(para. 1). According to Šarčević (1997), "Translations of legal texts lead to legal effects and
may even induce peace or prompt a war"(p. 1).
On the significance of legal translation to bridge gaps between not only two different
languages but also two different legal systems, Wagner (2003) commented, “In this era of
modernisation and globalisation, legal translation plays an essential role as a means of
communication enabling the mechanism of the law—i.e., the legal reasoning and drafting—to
work in more than one language” (p. 177). Matulewska and Gortych-Michalak (2014)
explained that the process of legal translation involves two types of communication: interlingual and inter-legal. The former refers to communication between two distinct languages
(i.e., SL and TL), and the latter refers to communication between two distinct legal systems
(i.e., that of SL and TL).
Joseph (1995) indicated that translation of legal texts is an interdisciplinary practice
that combines three theoretical aspects: legal theory, language theory, and translation theory.
Such complex and integrated nature of legal translation poses serious difficulty and causes
potential translation mistakes. Smith (1995) argued that successful translation of legal texts
requires prerequisite knowledge in three aspects: Source Language and Target Language legal
systems, legal terminology, and the writing style of the target language. In order for the legal
translator to maintain the effect of legal texts in the process of translation, the translator must
be able “to understand not only what the words mean and what a sentence means, but also what
legal effect it is supposed to have, and how to achieve that legal effect in the other language”
(Šarčević, 1997, p. 72).
There is a strong connection between legal translation and culture as laws are derived
from the culture of the people these laws apply to. According to Sierocka (2014), “little or no
attention is paid to the cultural dimension of legal discourse, which plays a critical role in the

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

27

translation and interpretation of legal texts, as well as in the application of law (p. 189). She
emphasized on the importance of taking the cultural dimension into consideration while
translating legal texts as she comments, “the primary aim of legal translation is to create a set
of parallel texts which are equal in legal effect from the source language to the target language
in terms of authority, function and legal status of the translated text, legal system and cultural
settings within of which the translated text will be read and/or used” (Sierocka, 2014, p. 190).
Translation scholars and researchers have diverse views on the appropriate translation
approach, whether literal or free, to be adopted in the translation of legal texts. According to
Mohammad, Alawi, & Fakhouri (2010), “the approaches to legal translation have been mostly
oriented towards the preservation of the letter than effective rendering in the target language”
(p. 1). Sakareva (2001) favored following the literal translation─ ‘formal correspondence’
according to Catford (1965) ─ approach when dealing with legal texts for the sensitivity of
their content. Šarčević (1997), however, argued that translators were "long convinced that all
legal translation had to be literal…thus giving the impression that legal translation is a
mechanical process of transcoding" (p. 229). Al-Aqad (2014) supported Šarčević’s argument
and pointed out that literal translation in legal texts could be problematic and may lead to
mistranslation.
A shift towards a more flexible, non-literal, recipient-oriented approach to legal
translation is gradually increasing (Fakhouri, 2008). Having conducted a Japanese-English
translation study on the applicability of free translation in legal texts, Fujii (2013) concluded
that both translation approaches (i.e., literal and free) are equally needed in legal translation to
achieve successful and meaningful translation taking into consideration the linguistic, cultural,
and legal differences between the SL and TL. In this context, Fakhouri (2008) commented that
legal translation “stretches over a continuum that includes both literal or formal translation at
one end and free or dynamic translation at the other end” (p. 75).

Problems and Difficulties of Legal Translation
The field of law is considered to be one of the most challenging fields for translators,

especially when the SL and the TL have distinct linguistic systems. According to El-Farahaty
(2016), “The asymmetry between English and Arabic poses many difficulties for legal
translators, be they linguistic-based, culture-specific or system-based” (p. 473). She explained
that problematic issues arise in legal translation due to the extremely diverse legal systems
between English and Arabic, which, indeed, comprise different cultures and linguistic systems.
Al-Tameemi and Farhan (2016) classified the difficulties translators may encounter when
translating legal texts into three categories: semantic, syntactic, and cultural difficulties.
On the semantic level, problems encompass the “lack of established terminology,
finding functional and lexical equivalence, word for word translation, synonymous and
antonymous words, wordiness and redundancy” (Al-Tameemi & Farhan, 2016, p. 1). ElFarahaty (2016) also highlighted the lexical difficulties legal translators encounter in
translating archaic terms, Latin terms, technical terms, religious and culture-specific terms, and
system-based terms. She justified that these difficulties are due to the lack of one-to-one
correspondence between English and Arabic legal discourses. Alcaraz and Hughes (2014) also
commented that “the technicalities of legal vocabulary present a serious challenge to the
translator or interpreter” (pp. 14-15).
The syntactic difficulties encountered in legal translation include “word order, syntactic
arrangement, unusual sentence structure, the use of modal verbs in English, and difference in
legal system” (Al-Tameemi & Farhan, 2016, p. 1). Since English and Arabic belong to
distinctly different language families, legal translation problems are more likely to exist. AlNajjar (2011) also highlighted the problems of mistranslation of English modal verbs, incorrect
use of capitalization and punctuation marks, and misusing verb tenses. Furthermore, the long,

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

29

complex nature of English legal sentences makes the task of decoding, comprehending, and
encoding a very challenging task for legal translators (Ali, 2016; Al-Tameemi & Farhan, 2016).
There is a close correlation between legal translation and the cultures of the SL and the
TL because “the legal system of the source text (ST) is structured in a way that suits that culture,
and this is reflected in the legal language; similarly, the target text (TT) is to be read by
someone who is familiar with the other legal system and its language (Al-Tameemi & Farhan,
2016, pp. 1-2). Bostanji (2010) examined the difficulties legal translators face while translating
Arabic and English legal texts and found out that the translation of culture-specific terms is the
most difficult part in translating legal documents from Arabic into English and vice versa.
The overall translation problems and challenges encountered when translating legal
texts can be said to exist due to the unfamiliarity of legal style and terminology, lack of
background knowledge of legal documents, and the absence of systematic analysis of legal
translation errors (Al-Amri, 2015; Bostanji, 2010). In this regard, Cao (2007) pointed out that
“legal translation is not the automatic transposition of a concept from one language into
another, but rather it requires thorough knowledge of the two legal systems that interface with
another as well as a comparative analysis of the text and the terms to be translated” (p. 54).
Al-Amri (2015) also added that difficulties in legal translation occur due to the
translator’s incompetency and limited knowledge of translation strategies and techniques that
could help overcome translation challenges. Alsaeed (2017) also pointed out that problems in
legal translation also occur due to adopting the literal translation approach solely and calls for
an integrated approach to legal translation that combines both literal and free translation to
avoid translation problems. Finally, drafting legal texts by non-professional legal writers poses
more challenges to the translator regarding vagueness and ambiguity (Mohammad, Alawi, &
Fakhouri, 2010).

Catford's Typology of Translation Shifts
In his book, A Linguistic Theory to Translation, Catford (1965) tackled the notion of

translation from a linguistic-oriented approach. He defined translation as “an operation
performed on languages, a process of substituting a text in one language for a text in another”
(p. 1). He argued that translation theory is mainly a branch of linguistic theory as he first
highlighted the fact that translation mainly deals with languages, then he described how
translation happens between two languages. From his definition of translation Catfrod (1965)
derived his general linguistic theory to translation. He explains, “any theory of translation must
draw upon a theory of language─a general linguistic theory” (p. 1).
Catford (1965) associated translation with three fields of linguistics, namely general
linguistics, comparative linguistics, and applied linguistics. He clarified that “General
Linguistics is, primary, a theory about how languages work” (p.1). These two fields are relevant
because they both have in common the aspect of ‘language’. Catford (1965) defined
Comparative Linguistics as “an extension of descriptive linguistics which establishes the
relation between two or more languages” (p.19). Since translation concerns a relation between
two languages, it is relevant to Comparative Linguistics. Finally, translation is also seen by
Catford (1965) as a branch of Applied Linguistics since translation is, in fact, a practice of
rendering the content of the SL to the TL. He defined Applied Linguistics as “all those
applications of the theory and categories of general linguistics which go beyond (i) elucidation
of how language work and (ii) the description of a particular language or languages for its/their
sake’ (p. 19).
During the process of translation, many linguistic changes take place, especially when
the source language and the target language belong to different language families and hence
have distinct linguistic systems. To trace and analyze such changes, many scholars, including
John Catford, Anton Popovič, and Mona Baker, have proposed various types of translation

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

31

shifts (Al-Hamed, 2016). Catford (1965) introduced the linguistic-oriented notion of
‘translation shifts’ and its types, which was his major contribution to the field of translation
theory (Leonardi, 2000). For such contribution, Catford is named ‘The Father of Translation
Shifts’ (Al-Hamed, 2016). Catford (1965) defined ‘shifts’ as the “departures from formal
correspondence in the process of going from the SL to the TL” (p. 73). According to Djamila
(2010), “Whenever languages exhibit differences, translation shifts are said to occur and be the
most required translation strategy in establishing equivalence” (p. 42). These translation shifts
are described by Larson (1998) as the process of “reconstructing this same meaning using the
lexicon and grammatical structure which are appropriate in the receptor language and its
cultural context” (p. 3).
Catford (1965) pointed out that translation shifts occur in the case of the absence of
‘formal correspondence’ in the target text. He defined formal correspondence as “any TL
category which can be said to occupy, as nearly as possible, the same place in the economy of
the TL as the given SL category occupies in the SL” (Catford, 1965, p. 32). In other words,
‘formal correspondence is a word-for-word rendition from the SL to TL. Catford (1965)
explained that each language is unique in its nature and grammatical rules; hence, finding
“formal correspondence is nearly always approximate” (p. 27). As opposed to formal
correspondence, Catford (1965) also discussed the concept of textual equivalence, which is
“any TL text or portion of text which is observed on a particular occasion… to be the equivalent
of a given SL text or portion of text” (Catford, 1965, p. 27). From this definition, it can be said
that translation shifts occur in the absence of formal correspondence to achieve functional
equivalence.
Djamila (2010) combined Catford’s two major types of translation shifts, i.e., level
shifts and category shifts, with Mona Baker’s translation changes to form a comprehensive
diagram of changes that take place in the process of translation. As shown in the diagram below,

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

32

Baker’s broader classification includes shifts of omission, shifts of addition, semantic shifts,
and grammatical shifts. Whereas semantic shifts are “those elements which are said to be
changed in their meaning” (Djamila, 2010, p. 51), grammatical shifts occur because
“differences between the grammatical systems between languages necessarily entail shifts in
textual aspects. This involves a change of word class, structure, unit, number, etc.” (Djamila,
2010, p. 62). Djamila (2010) placed Catford’s types of translation shifts under Baker’s
grammatical shifts.
Djamila’s attempt to join Catford’s efforts with Mona’s in a single diagram provides a
more comprehensive approach towards the changes that take place in the process of translating
the ST into the TT. Catford’s translation shifts overlooked the shifts of addition and omission
and the changes on the semantic level, such as explicitation and generalization, and are specific
to the changes on the linguistic level. Mona’s model, however, covered these changes in a more
general perspective without providing detailed subcategorization of her main translation shifts.
Hence, integrating these two models better serves the understanding and observance of the
changes and shifts occurring in the process of translation, whether to maintain the meaning or
for aesthetic purposes and personal choices.

Figure1: Types of Translation Shifts (Djamila, 2010, p. 53)

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

33

2.5.1 Level Shifts
Catford (1965) defined ‘level shifts’ as the change that takes place when “an SL item
at one linguistic level has a TL equivalent at a different level” (p. 73). He explained that shifts
from ‘grammar to lexis’ are “the only possible level-shifts in translation; and such shifts are,
of course, quite common” (p. 73). In other words, a grammatical item in the source language
is expressed using a word in the target language or vice versa. An example of level shifts is the
translation of “‫ ”أفعالي كلها مقدرة عنده‬into “all my actions have been preordained by him.” The
lexis ‘‫ ’مقدرة‬has been translated into grammar ‘have been preordained’ (Al-Hamed, 2016, p.
33).
2.5.2 Category Shifts
The other type of Catford's translation shifts─ category shifts─ is subdivided into four
types: structure shifts, class shifts, unit shifts, and intra-system shifts.
2.5.2.1 Structure Shifts
Structure shifts are the changes in the grammatical structure (word order) of a
sentence at any linguistic rank (i.e., phrases, clauses, and sentences). For example, the
Arabic sentence “‫ ”قال صديقي في شماتة‬is translated into “My friend spoke gloatingly” where
the Verb-Subject order in Arabic is reversed into Subject-Verb in English (Al-Hamed,
2016, p. 37).
2.5.2.2 Class Shifts
Class shifts are the change from one part of speech to another without affecting the
meaning. This shift corresponds to Vinay and Darbelnet’s ‘transposition’ translation
procedure (Vinay & Darbelnet, 1995). An example of class shifts is found in the translation
of “‫ ”صديقي رجل يحب الجدل ويهوى الكالم‬into “My friend is a man who likes to argue and delights
in talking.” The Arabic noun ‘‫ ’الجدل‬is translated into a verb in English. In spite of the
change in part of speech, the meaning is still the same (Al-Hamed, 2016, p. 37).

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

34

2.5.2.3 Unit Shifts
Another type of category shifts is unit shifts─ also referred to as ‘rank-change.’
Catford (1965) defined unit shifts as “departures from formal correspondence in which the
translation equivalent of a unit at one rank in the SL is a unit at a different rank in the TL”
(p. 79). They are changes in the units of language (i.e., words, phrases, clauses,
sentences…etc.). For example, the Arabic sentence “‫ ”كيف يخلق الكراهية والقبح والشر؟‬is
translated into “how then did it come that he created hatred, ugliness, and evil?” The Arabic
word ‘‫ ’كيف‬is translated into the clause ‘how then did it come that’ (Al-Hamed, 2016, p.
45).
2.5.2.4 Intra-system Shifts
The last type of category shifts is intra-system shifts. This kind occurs when the
“translation involves selection of a non-corresponding term in the TL system,” (Catford,
1965, p. 80). Intra-system shifts usually take place in the cases of plural and singular,
definite and indefinite, and neutral and gender-specific (Al-Hamed, 2016). An example of
this type of shifts is found the translation of the Arabic “‫”لنا على ذلك براهين تؤيدنا وتشجب كالمكم‬
into “We have evidence to support our view and refute yours.” The Arabic plural word
‘‫ ’براهين‬is translated into a singular word in English ‘evidence’ (Al-Hamed, 2016, p. 48).
2.6

Translation Shifts and Transposition
Many studies by linguistic and translation scholars are centered on the changes and

alterations that take place at different levels in the process of translation to preserve the
meaning. This phenomenon is given various terms by many scholars and theorists and seen as
translation changes or strategies and procedures. In spite of the difference in terminology
between translation changes and translation strategies, they both eventually aim at preserving
the meaning of the ST in the TT. Catford (1965) tagged this phenomenon with the term ‘shifts’
and is known for this pioneering contribution to the field of translation theory. He introduced

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

35

his taxonomy of translation shifts, mainly level shifts and category shifts, which is subdivided
into structure shifts, unit shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts. His shifts were defined as
‘the departures from formal correspondence in the process of going from the SL to the TL’
(Catford, 1965, p. 73).
Vinay and Darbelnet (1995), on the other hand, introduced seven translation procedures
describing the same phenomenon of translation changes. The first three translation procedures,
namely borrowing, calque, and literal translation, are direct translation methods and the
remaining four translation procedures, namely transposition, modulation, equivalence, and
adaptation are oblique translation methods.
Even though both Catford and Vinay and Darbelnet’s tackled different translation
changes, they only agreed on the change that takes place on the part of speech from the ST into
the TT as Vinay and Darbelnet’s translation procedures ‘transposition’ corresponds to
Catford’s ‘class shifts’. Vinay and Darbelnet (1995) defined ‘transposition’ as a translation
method that “consists of replacing one class of words by another without changing the meaning
of the message” (p. 94). Catford (1965), on the other hand, defined class shifts as a change that
“occurs when the translation equivalent of an SL item is a member of a different class from the
original item” (p. 78). Both definitions described the change in the grammar, mainly the change
on the class level, between the ST and the TT. Moreover, both transposition and class shifts
can be either obligatory or optional depending on the ability to transfer the meaning in the TT
as closely as possible to that of the ST.
2.7

Previous Studies on Catford’s Translation Shifts
In this part, the researcher reviewed the previous studies that applied Catford’s typology

of translation shifts on a variety of text types. The researcher arranged the previous studies
chronologically, from recent studies to older ones to portray an up-to-date image of the

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

36

literature status with regards to Catford’s notion of translation shifts. Moreover, previous
studies tackling translation in the field of law were also observed in this section.
Al-Majed (2017) designed the study to investigate the frequency of translation shifts in
the English-Arabic translation of a literary text with special focus on category shifts structure
shifts, unit shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts). Catford’s model of translation shifts was
employed as an instrument for analysis. To meet the objective of the study, the researcher
conducted a comparative analysis on two Arabic translation versions of the first and second
chapters of the novel Animal Farm by George Orwell. The results of the analysis indicated that
all four types of category shifts were detected in both translation versions. It was also
demonstrated that unit shifts (35%) were the most frequently employed type of shifts in both
Arabic translation versions. The second most frequent type of category shifts in the two
translation versions was structure shifts (33%), followed by class shifts (18%), and finally intrasystem shifts (14%).
Salemi and Lotfi (2017) investigated the frequency of structural shifts in humor
translation from English into Persian. The researchers applied Catford’s model of translation
shifts to pinpoint the changes that take place in the translation process. The method used to
answer the research question on the frequency of structural shifts was comparative contentanalysis. To conduct the analysis, two volumes of Horrible History Books for children and their
Persian translation were selected to trace the structural shifts based on Catford’s theory. The
results demonstrated that structural shifts occurred in the cases of addition and omission, word
order re-arrangements, shifts of voice, shifts of tense, and negative/positive. The results also
indicated that structural shifts of addition and omission were the most frequent type of shifts
(45.85%), followed by shifts of arrangement (25.76%), shifts of voice (21.83%), and finally
shifts of tense (15.28%). It was also concluded that both SL and TL must be taken into
consideration to achieve successful translation.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

37

Al-Dulaimi (2016) investigated the frequency of Catford’s category shifts (structure
shifts, unit shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts) in a literary text and to see how
satisfactory resorting to these shifts is to produce equivalents in the TT. The researcher selected
three chapters from the classic American novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum
and compared the original text with two Arabic translation versions by Alsaidi and Hasan.
After tracing the shifts in both translation versions, the results indicated that unit shifts were
the highest in frequency (42%) immediately followed by structure shifts (41%), then class
shifts (9%), and finally intra-system shifts. The researcher also concluded that optional shifts
were used for aesthetic reasons while obligatory shifts were resorted to preserve the meaning.
Al-Hamed (2016) conducted a descriptive content-analysis study on an Islamic
philosophical text by means of applying Catford’s typology of translation shifts. The
researched selected nineteen Arabic texts from Mostafa Mahmoud's book Dialogue with an
Atheist and their published English translation as a sample for analysis. The study was carried
out to determine the most recurrent type of translation shifts in Islamic translation from Arabic
into English. It also aimed at investigating the role of translation shifts in maintaining the
meaning of the target text. Finally, the study was conducted to see how applicable Catford's
translation shifts to trace the linguistic changes that take place in the translation of Islamic
philosophical texts from Arabic into English. The researcher concluded that all four types of
Catford’s translation shifts occurred in the translation with unit shifts being the most frequent
type (28.6%), followed by structure shifts (26.5%), then class shifts (20.1%), then intra-system
shifts (18.2%), and finally level shifts (6.6%). The results also indicated that Catford’s
translation shifts were useful to bridge the linguistic and cultural gap between Arabic and
English; however, the researcher concluded that Catford’s translation shifts are not
comprehensive as there were other shifts such as shifts of omission and addition.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

38

Diena (2015) employed a descriptive qualitative approach aiming at discovering the
frequency of translation shifts according to Catford’s model, with focus on category shifts, in
the translation of 15 randomly selected sentences from two Strawberry Shortcake EnglishIndonesian bilingual children books. The researcher compared each ST phrase or sentence with
its equivalence in the TT and traced the changes that took place in the process of translation.
The results of the analysis showed that all four types of category shifts (structure shifts, unit
shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts) were found in the translation children books from
English into Indonesian. Unit shifts were the most frequently employed type of shifts (6 cases),
followed by structure shifts and class shifts scoring the same number of frequency (4 cases),
and finally intra-system shifts (3 cases).
Herman (2014) conducted a descriptive study revolving around discovering Catford’s
shift types that occur in the translation of movie subtitles from English into Indonesian and
determining the most dominant type among these shifts. To achieve that, the researcher applied
Catford’s notion of translation shifts to 50% of the translation of the subtitles of the movie
Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone from English into Indonesian as a sample for
analysis. Every sentence clause, phrase, and word in the TT was compared to its original in the
ST. From the analysis, it was demonstrated that all four category shift types (structure shifts,
unit shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts) were found in the English-Indonesian
translation of the movie subtitles. Moreover, it was concluded that unit shifts were the most
frequently applied type of category shifts based on Catford’s model.
In their descriptive study, Khanmohammad and Mousavanasab (2014) applied
Catford’s model of translation shifts to the translation of medical texts from English into
Persian. The objective of the study was to determine how frequent Catford’s translation shifts
occurred in the process of translating medical texts from English into Persian. To achieve this
objective, the researchers collected 320 sentences extracted from five books, each belongs to a

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

39

distinct medical branch. The researchers then analyzed the Persian translation of this sample of
medical texts by applying Catford’s categorization of translation shifts. The results of the
analysis showed that structural shifts were the most frequently used type of translation shifts
in the English-Persian translation of medical texts as it existed in all 320 sampled sentences
(100%). With the huge difference between the frequency of structure shifts in comparison with
the other types of linguistic shifts, Intra-system shifts were the second mostly employed type
of shifts (7.81%), then unit shifts (5.31%), and finally class shifts (4.06%). The researchers
concluded that Catford’s model of translation shifts is not appropriate for the assessment of
English-Persian translation of medical texts due to transliterating most medical jargon terms
instead of translating them, which, indeed, affected the result of the analysis.
In a comparative study concerning Islamic texts, the Holy Quran in particular, Rezvani
and Nouraey (2014) adopted Catford’s notion of translation shift as a model for the analysis.
The study aimed to determine the frequency of translation shifts in the translation of the Holy
Quran from Arabic into English. For that aim, the researcher selected the first thirty verses of
the Chapter ‘Yusuf’ as a sample of the Quran. To conduct the analysis, the researcher selected
seven English translation versions of the selected sample by Sarwar, Arberry, Irring, Pickthall,
Saffarzade, Shakir and Yusef Ali. Each of these translation versions was compared to the
original text to detect the frequency of the translation shifts in each version. Moreover,
frequencies of translation shifts in the seven English translation versions were compared to one
another to identify the version that top-scored in the frequency of translation shifts. The results
proved that all five types of translation shifts according to Catford’s model (level shifts,
structure shifts, unit shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts) occurred in all seven translation
versions with unit shifts being the most frequently employed type of shifts. The results also
showed that Shakir’s translation scored the highest frequency of translation shifts.

Hosseini-Maasoum and Shahbaiki (2013) investigated the frequency of translation
shifts in the translation of Charles Dickens’ novel Tale of Two Cities from English into Persian
and examined the translator’s faithfulness to the ST. To conduct the analysis, the researchers
randomly selected forty sentences from the first six chapters of the novel and compared them
with their translated equivalents into Persian to pinpoint the translation shifts. The results
showed that all four types of category shifts (structure shifts, unit shifts, class shifts, and intrasystem shifts) occurred in the translation and unit shifts were the most frequent type (37.5%),
followed by class shifts (30%), intra-system shifts (27.5%), and structure shifts (12.5%). The
researchers also concluded that translation shifts are sometimes inevitable to maintain the
meaning when the SL and the TL are different in nature as in the case of translation from
English into Persian.
Hijjo (2013) conducted a master’s applying Catford’s model of translation shifts to the
Arabic translation of 40 English texts obtained from the website of the British Broadcasting
Company (BBC) channel. The study aimed at identifying the types of translation shifts
according to Catford’s model that occur in the translation of media news from English into
Arabic. It also sought to investigate the quality of rendered messages in the TT in comparison
to those in the ST. The researcher analyzed the translation of the 40 texts and concluded that
all types of translation shifts (structure shifts, unit shifts, class shifts, and intra-system shifts)
occurred with unit shifts being the most frequently employed type of shifts in the translation of
the media news texts from English into Arabic and structure shifts come second. The finding
also indicated that both level shifts and structural shifts of agent rarely existed in the EnglishArabic translation of BBC news. Moreover, the researcher found out that both optional and
obligatory translation shifts occurred to avoid meaning loss in the TL and to preserve the
quality of the ST in the TT. However, it was found that meaning and quality were not achieved

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

41

by applying in the structure shifts from passive voice to active voice and in a few cases of unitshifts.
Kalantari and Karimnia (2011) examined what types of translation shifts in accordance
with Catford’s taxonomy of translation shifts (level shifts, structure shifts, unit shifts, class
shifts, and intra-system shifts) take place in the process of translating a play from English into
Persian. For the purpose of the analysis, twenty sentences were randomly selected from Death
Knocks play by Woody Allen and compared with their Persian translations. The findings of the
analysis of the twenty sentences showed that the frequency of structural shifts was the highest
(13 cases), followed by unit shifts (5 cases), class shifts (2 cases), and level shifts (1 case). It
was also found that intra-system shifts did not take place in the process of translating the play
from English into Arabic. The researchers concluded that the high frequency of structure shifts
in comparison with the other types of shifts is attributable to the difference in structure between
English and Persian.
Djamila (2010) conducted a qualitative and quantitative master’s study to examine the
occurrence of translation shifts to preserve lexical cohesion from Arabic into English and to
investigate the resulted semantic and textual implications from the translation. The researcher
selected thirty English language students in the first master year of Applied Language Studies
at the Mentouri University of Constantine as a population for the study. The selected students
were asked to translate a text about self-confidence and psychology taken from ‘Aususu Altarjama’ (‫ )أسس الترجمة‬by Az-aldine Najib without consulting dictionaries. The text was
analyzed based on four types of translation shifts: grammatical shifts, semantic shifts, shifts of
addition, and shifts of omission. Having compared the students’ translation with the original
text, the researcher found out that grammatical shifts are the highest in occurrence (54.02%),
followed by semantic shifts (29.81%), then shifts by omission (9.29%), and finally shifts by
addition (6.88%). Grammatical shifts were further analyzed into five types: unit shifts

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

42

(38.67%), level shifts (22.41%), intra-system shifts (15.80), class shifts (12.03%), and finally
structure shifts (11.09%). In conclusion, the researcher pointed out that students’ shifts did not
achieve equivalence in all cases because they focus on the lexical level and neglect the
functional (grammatical or textual) level.
2.8 Previous Studies on Legal Translation
This section overviewed the previous studies related to legal translation. Numerous
translation studies have been conducted in the field of law, some of which focused on the
problems and difficulties encountered in the process of translating legal texts, the strategies
used in legal translation, functional equivalence in legal translation, the translation of specific
lexical categories, such as collocation, in legal texts, etc. The reviewed studies were arranged
chronologically, recent studies first.
Al-Saeed (2017) examined Nida’s dichotomy of functional and dynamic translation
approaches in the translation of legal contracts from Arabic into English. It also sought to
identify the translation problems as well as the translation procedures adopted by translators in
translating legal contracts. To meet the objectives of the study, the researcher selected five legal
contracts to be translated from Arabic into English by two certified translators to compare
between the two versions regarding the applicability of Nida’s formal or dynamic translation
approaches. Moreover, interviews were carried on with the translators to pinpoint the
difficulties they faced and to suggest solutions for such translation problems. The study
findings showed that applying formal equivalence solely resulted in translation problems. The
researcher called for integrating both approaches, i.e., formal and dynamic, when translating to
overcome legal translation problems.
On her research, Arwa Al-Abdullatif (2016) identified the problems and challenges of
translating lease contracts from English into Arabic. The researcher selected fifteen female MA

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

43

students majoring in translation at Al-Imam University to undergo the translation test of a lease
contract. A qualitative approach was adopted to analyze the translated lease contract based on
error analysis. From the error analysis, numerous translation issues and difficulties were
identified. The study findings showed that the difficulties encountered by Al-Imam University
MA female translation students were either related to form or content. Form-related issues
included problems in punctuation, capitalization, legal drafting, sentence structure, and finally
grammar. Content-related issues, on the other hand, covered problems in the use of modal
verbs, such as the verb ‘shall’, and the use of archaic terms. To overcome such difficulties in
translating legal texts, particularly lease contracts, the researcher recommended offering
courses specialized in legal translation for MA students to promote their knowledge and
familiarity with legal terms, structure, and style.
In a similar study, Ali (2016) investigated the difficulties faced by professional
translators in Sudan in the translation of legal contracts from Arabic into English and vice
versa. To meet the objectives of the study, the researcher adopted a quantitative approach by
designing a questionnaire to be answered by thirty-three randomly selected Sudanese
professional translators sharing the same background and educational level. The collected data
showed that there were many translation challenges in translating legal contracts between
English and Arabic. Most challenges were linguistic, then stylistic, cultural, and stylistic. It
was also found that these challenges were attributed to the poor exposure to legal language and
the unfamiliarity with its style. Finally, it was recommended that legal texts be translated by
experienced translators. Moreover, holding legal translation workshops and courses is advised.
Al-Tameemi and Farhan (2016) also investigated the difficulties of legal translation.
The researchers analyzed the translation of different forms of marriage and divorce contracts,
translated from Arabic into English. They categorized the translation difficulties into syntactic,
semantic, and cultural difficulties. Examples of syntactic difficulties involved word order,

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

44

syntactic arrangements, legal sentence structures, English modal verbs, dissimilar legal Arabic
and English systems. Semantic difficulties included lack of established terminology, difficulty
in finding functional and lexical equivalence, word for word translation, synonymous and
antonymous words, wordiness and redundancy, loan words, neologisms, and paraphrasing.
Finally, cultural difficulties covered dissimilarity in norms, traditions, faiths, and doctrines, in
addition to the unfamiliarity with religious and social terminology. The researchers attributed
such legal translation difficulties to the difference in legal systems between Arabic and English
and to the absence of equivalence to some terms in the TL.
Henka (2014) focused on the lexical category of collocations in legal texts. The
researcher extracted nine English collocations from the Algerian Constitution and compared
their Arabic translation with The Dictionary of Collocations by Hasan Ghazala. From the
analysis, it was found that collocations pose translation difficulties, such as generalization and
variability of collocations, due to their arbitrary nature. It was also found that such difficulties
arise from the linguistic and cultural disparities between English and Arabic. The researcher
suggested a number of solutions to overcome the challenges of translating legal collocation
from English into Arabic. Firstly, identical collocations in Arabic must be looked for at first.
Secondly, in case of the absence of identical collocations in Arabic, a close collocation has to
be demonstrated. Thirdly, direct meanings should be rendered into direct meanings and indirect
meanings should be rendered into indirect meanings as well. Fourthly, the level of formality of
the ST must be maintained in the TT. Lastly, in case all previous solutions failed to solve the
problem, it is suggested to translate the collocation directly and literally.
Al-Shehab (2013) investigated the applicability of machine translation in the translation
of legal texts from English into Arabic. The six English articles were translated by Google
Translate into Arabic and evaluated in comparison with two Arabic translation versions by
legal professionals from the Departments of Translation at Yarmouk and Jordanian

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

45

Universities. The qualitative analysis showed that showed that Google Translate adopted the
word-for-word approach, which resulted in odd and unacceptable Arabic translations. There
were issues in translating archaic terms, modal verbs, and passive voice structures via Google
Translate. It was concluded that Google Translate under-performed in legal translation and that
human translation skills outperform the abilities of machine translation.
2.9 Commentary
In this chapter, the researcher presented the theoretical framework of the study.
Moreover, the researcher tackled the notions and topics related to the present study, such as the
nature of English and Arabic legal languages, the notion of legal translation, the problems and
difficulties encountered in the process of translating legal texts, Catford’s model of translation
shifts, and previous studies on the application of Catford’s typology of translation shifts to
different texts types.
In the previous studies section, the researcher attempted to review studies applying
Catford’s model of translation shifts to various fields as well as studies focusing on legal
translation. Moreover, Catford’s taxonomy of translation shifts has been employed in many
fields such as Islam, literature, medicine, media, and psychology; however, employing
Catford’s model of translation shifts to legal text is overlooked and under-discussed. Thus, the
researcher attempted to fill such gap in literature by conducting the current study.
With regard to the review of previous studies conducted on the field of legal translation,
the majority of studies focused on investigating the errors and difficulties encountered in the
translation of legal texts of different types. Little attention was paid to other topics, such as
collocations and cultural terms, or the application of different translation theories. Such lack of
diversity of research topics in the field of legal translation highlights the fact that this field of
research is insufficiently investigated and necessitates conducting further research in this area
of specialized translation, especially between Arabic and English.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

46

It is worth mentioning that most translation studies on the application of Catford’s
model of translation shifts, including Al-Majed’s (2017), Al-Dulaimi’s (2016), Diena’s (2015),
Herman’s (2014), and many others, mainly focused on category shifts and overlooked level
shifts. Studies including level shifts, on the other hand, were limited in number, including the
current study, Alhamed’s (2016), Revani and Nouraey’s (2014), and Kalantari and Karimnia’s
(2011).
By comparing between the studies on the application of Catford’s translation shifts on
different text genres from English into Arabic, it was noticed that the frequency of translation
shifts varies from one text genre to another. In the present study in the legal field, intra-system
shifts ranked top in frequency. However, unit shifts were the highest in frequency in both AlMajed’s (2017) study in the field of literature and Hijjo’s (2013) in media news.

Chapter Three: Methodology
3.1 Introduction
The aim of this chapter was to shed light on the systematic methods and procedures
applied by the researcher to meet the study objectives and answer the research questions. This
chapter discussed the methodology of the study in detail. The procedures and steps followed
by the researcher for the purpose of answering the research questions were presented in this
section. Furthermore, the sample English and Arabic texts used for analysis were described and
the purpose of choosing the data source and Catford's model of translation shifts was justified.
3.2 Method of the Study
The current study adopted a descriptive quantitative approach on the official Arabic
translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) as a representative to legal
texts. The researcher employed Catford's model of translations shifts (level and category) as an
instrument to conduct the analysis. Using Catford’s taxonomy of translation shifts, the
researcher compared every SL text segment with its equivalent in the TL and traced all the
changes made in the process of translation. Then, every alteration detected was categorized
according to Catford’s translation shifts to determine which types occur in translating legal
texts from English into Arabic.
The frequency of each type of translation shifts was counted manually and listed in a
table to specify the most frequently employed type of translation shifts. During the analysis of
the TT, the researcher examined every translation shift in the translation of the UN’s
Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) from English into Arabic to decide whether each
shift is obligatory or optional. This procedure was done to eventually identify the inevitability
of resorting to translation shifts to maintain the meaning of the ST in the TT.

3.3 Sample of the Study
3.3.1 Sample Texts
The sample used for the descriptive analysis in this study was extracted from the UN’s
Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) as a representative to legal texts. Since the
Convention seemed very long to be analyzed for the present study, the preamble and a number
of articles from the three parts of the Convention were selected to represent the entire
Convention. The criterion for selecting the articles from the three parts of the Convention was
the approximate word count of 400 words (almost equal to the preamble of the convention)
from each part of the Convention. The published Arabic translation of this sample was obtained
from the official website of the United Nations.

As shown in the table above, the English text sample from the UN’s Convention on the
Rights of the Child (1989) was composed of 1875 words (counted using word count in
Microsoft Word) forming only 43 sentences (counted manually). These statistics, in fact,
highlight the special feature of the extensive use of long, complex sentences in English legal
language. The Arabic text, on the other hand, consisted of 1432 words (counted using word
count in Microsoft Word) forming 64 sentences (counted manually). Even though the number
of words in the English text (=1875) was greatly higher than that of the Arabic text (=1432),
the English text, still, formed a smaller number of sentences than the Arabic text. This, indeed,
highlights the fact that the feature of long, complex sentences prevails in English legal language
more than Arabic legal language.

3.3.2 Procedures of Data Collection
This part explained the procedures used in the process of data collection to prepare the
sample text for analysis. The UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) is large legal
document arranged in four sections, namely the Preamble, Part I, Part II, and Part III, consisting
of 7610 words in total. To cover all four sections, the researcher selected a sample of about 400
words from the beginning of each of these sections. The number of words in each of the four
selected samples varied slightly due to the difference in length of the last sentence in each
selected sample. If all four extracted samples were exactly 400 words long, some sentences are
meaningless and incomplete as they were cut in the middle.
The corresponding Arabic sample was extracted from the official Arabic translation
published in the UN’s website. Whereas the English extracted sample was composed of 1875
words, the corresponding Arabic samples consisted of 1432 words. The English and Arabic
selected data were analyzed in terms of word count and sentence numbers manually and using
word count to provide insight into dissimilar natures of English and Arabic. This basic analysis
showed that the English ST was composed of 43 sentences (=1875 words) while the Arabic TT
consisted of 64 sentences (=1432 words). This asserted that long, complex sentences consisting
of many words prevailed in English legal texts rather than Arabic legal texts.
The English and Arabic extracted samples were aligned sentence by sentence in a word
document to analyze each of these sentences according to Catford’s taxonomy of translation
shifts. The researcher tracked all linguistic changes and tagged each with its type as per
Catford’s model. Moreover, each observed shift was examined to determine which shifts were
obligatory and which were optional. The frequency of each type of Catford’s was counted
manually, in addition to the frequency of optional and obligatory shifts. These procedures were
adopted to meet the objectives of the study and to answer the research questions.

3.3.3 Data Source: the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child
The UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) is a legal document declared
by the UN General Assembly on November 20, 1989, to protect the child’s civil, economic,
social, health and cultural rights all around the world (UNCRC, n.d.). The Convention is
composed of the preamble and 54 articles sorted into three parts. The preamble is the
introduction that lays down the foundation for the convention. The first part (articles 1-41)
defines the rights of the child and stipulates the obligations of the State Parties. The second
part (articles 42-45) specifies the measures for carrying out the provisions of the Convention.
Finally, the third part (articles 46-54) describes the miscellaneous provisions which govern the
Convention’s commencement and entry into force.
The UN’s official website published the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)
in numerous languages such as Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, and Chinses to be accessible
to all nations. The official Arabic translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child
(1989) (‫ )اتفاقية حقوق الطفل‬was obtained from the UN’s official website to be analyzed in
comparison with the original English text. The Arabic translation was relatively shorter than
the English one as proven in Table1 above due to the linguistic disparities between English and
Arabic languages.
3.3.4 Justification for Selecting the Data Source and Catford’s Model
The researcher deliberately decided on the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child
for the present research. The justification for such selection was that many studies heavily
focused on analyzing different types of contracts when discussing legal texts and overlooked
the other forms of legal texts, such as international conventions. Hence, the researcher aimed
at providing more insight concerning a different form of legal texts.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

51

As for the justification for choosing Catford’s model of translation shifts, the current
study was focused on the linguistic changes that take place in the process of translating legal
texts from English into Arabic to bridge the cultural and linguistic gaps between the two
languages. To track linguistic changes in translation, a suitable had to be employed. Since
Catford’s translation shifts were demonstrated to identify the translation changes, it was
practical and feasible to meet the study’s objectives.

Chapter Four: Discussion and Results

In this chapter, the researcher presented a descriptive quantitative analysis of the Arabic
translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which represents legal
texts in general. Each type of Catford's translation shifts is discussed solely in the following
subsections. Examples covering all four parts of the Convention, i.e. the preamble and the three
main parts, were also provided for each type of Catford’s translation shifts as applicable for
support and clarification. The analysis sought to answer the research questions and provide
statistics on the frequency of translation shifts and to determine the inevitability of resorting to
such translation shifts in the process of translating legal texts from English into Arabic.
4.1 Data Analysis and Discussion
4.1.1 Level Shifts
According to Catford, level shifts occur when there is a change of linguistic levels from
grammar to lexis or vice versa. In other words, it is the transference of a grammatical item in
the ST into a word in the TT or the transference of a word in the ST into a grammatical item in
the TT. The following are examples of both types of level shifts.
4.1.1.1 Shifts from grammar to lexis
This subcategory of level shifts constitutes a change from a grammatical item in the ST
to a lexical item (i.e. word) in the TT. The following examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: Recognizing that the United Nations has, in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and in the International Covenants on Human Rights, proclaimed and agreed
that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS
TT:

53

‫ في اإلعالن العالمي لحقوق اإلنسان وفى العهدين الدوليين‬،‫وإذا تدرك أن األمم المتحدة قد أعلنت‬
،‫ أن لكل إنسان حق التمتع بجميع الحقوق والحريات الواردة في تلك الصكوك‬،‫الخاصين بحقوق اإلنسان‬

In the example above, an obligatory level shift from grammar to lexis was observed.
The translator changed the English function word, which is the pronoun (everyone), into the
Arabic content word (‫)إنسان‬. To preserve the meaning of the English function word, an
obligatory shift had to take place by changing the word ‘everyone’ into its textual equivalent
in Arabic, which is the content word (‫)إنسان‬.
Example2:
ST: Recalling the provisions of the Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating
to the Protection and Welfare of Children,
TT:

‫وإذ تشير إلى أحكام اإلعالن المتعلق بالمبادئ االجتماعية والقانونية المتصلة بحماية األطفال ورعايتهم‬

This example includes a level shift from a grammatical item in the ST into a lexical
item in the TT. A function word in the ST, which is the preposition (on), was translated into
the content (‫ )المتعلق‬in the TT. This shift is optional because the English function word ‘on’
could simply be dropped in the TL and the meaning will be preserved.
4.1.1.2 Shifts from lexis to grammar
This subcategory of level shifts constitutes a change from a lexical item (word) in the
ST to a grammatical item (i.e. part of the linguistic structure) in the TT. The following examples
provide further explanation:

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

54

Example1:
ST: Taking due account of the importance of the traditions and cultural values of each
people for the protection and harmonious development of the child,
TT:

‫وإذ تأخذ في االعتبار الواجب أهمية تقاليد كل شعب وقيمه الثقافية لحماية الطفل وترعرعه ترعرعا‬
،‫متناسقا‬

In this example, two level shifts from lexis to grammar were detected. The first level
shift took place when the translator rendered the lexical item (people) in the of-genitive phrase
in the ST into a grammatical item in the word (‫)قيمه‬, which is the underlined genitive bound
pronoun referring to the word (people). Similarly, the second shift occurred when the lexis
(child) in the of-genitive phrase was transferred into a genitive bound pronoun as underlined
in (‫ )ترعرعه‬to refer to the word (child). Both level shifts from lexis to grammar were obligatory
because the Arabic language tends to use bound pronouns to reflect the genitive case.
Example2:
ST: For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being
below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority
is attained earlier.
TT:

‫ ما لم يبلغ سن الرشد قبل ذلك‬،‫ يعنى الطفل كل إنسان لم يتجاوز الثامنة عشرة‬،‫ألغراض هذه االتفاقية‬
.‫بموجب القانون المنطبق عليه‬

In the above example, there is a level shift from lexis to grammar. The lexical item
(child) in the ST was translated into a grammatical item in the TT, which is the underline bound
pronoun in (‫)عليه‬. This is because the word (‫)الطفل‬, which is the translation of the word (child),
was already mentioned before in the Arabic sentence, making it inadvisable to repeat the word

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

55

in Arabic. This shift was obligatory because sound Arabic uses bound pronouns instead of
repeating the word they refer to.
Example3:
ST: States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present
Convention to each child within their jurisdiction
TT:

‫تحترم الدول األطراف الحقوق الموضحة في هذه االتفاقية وتضمنها لكل طفل يخضع لواليتها‬

There is a level shift from lexis to grammar in this sentence. The lexical item (rights) is
the object of two verbs: respect and ensure. The lexis (rights) was translated into lexis with the
former verb (‫)تحترم الدول األطراف الحقوق‬. With the latter verb, however, the lexis (rights) was
rendered into a bound pronoun as underlined in (‫)تضمنها‬. This shift was obligatory because
Arabic tends to avoid repetition; instead, bound pronouns are used extensively in Arabic. The
following table listed the statistics of all observed level shifts:

4.1.2 Category Shifts
4.1.2.1 Structure Shifts
Structure shifts are defined by Catford (1965) as the changes in the grammatical
structure of a sentence at any linguistic rank (i.e., phrases, clauses and sentences). Structure
shifts can be changes in word order, nominal-verbal sentence structure, and passive-active

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

56

voice shifts. Below, the researcher elaborates each type of structure shifts supported by
examples.
4.1.2.1.1 Shifts in word order
This type of structure shifts takes place when there is a change in the organization of
words in a sentence between the ST and the TT. The following examples provide further
explanation:
Example1:
ST: Bearing in mind that the need to extend particular care to the child has been stated
in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924
TT:

‫وإذ تضع في اعتبارها أن الحاجة إلى توفير رعاية خاصة للطفل قد ذكرت في إعالن جنيف لحقوق‬
1924 ‫الطفل لعام‬

In this example, two obligatory structure shifts in word order occurred. The first one is
a structure shift in head-modifier word order. As underlined, the modifier+head structure in the
ST (particular care) was reversed to a head+modifier structure in the TT (‫)رعاية خاصة‬. The
second structural shift is a shift in word order from noun premodifier+noun structure as in the
underlined ST phrase (Geneva Declaration) to noun+noun premodifier in the TT (‫)إعالن جنيف‬.
Both obligatory shifts were attributed to the structural disparities between English and Arabic.
Example2:
ST: States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care
TT:

‫تتعهد الدول األطراف بأن تضمن للطفل الحماية والرعاية‬

This example contains a structure shift in subject-verb sentence order. The translator
rendered the subject+verb order in the English ST (States Parties undertake) into verb+subject

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

57

in the Arabic TT (‫)تتعهد الدول األطراف‬. This structure shift was obligatory as the English sentence
structure starts with the subject (subject+verb+object) whereas the Arabic structure starts with
the verb (verb+subject+object).
Example3:
ST: States Parties undertake to make the principles and provisions of the Convention
widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.
TT:

‫تتعهد الدول األطراف بأن تنشر مبادئ االتفاقية وأحكامها على نطاق واسع بالوسائل المالئمة‬
.‫ بين الكبار واألطفال على السواء‬،‫والفعالة‬

This example includes two structure shifts in word order. The first structure shift
occurred in the subject-verb sentence structure. The English subject+verb word order in (States
Parties undertake) was reversed into verb+subject in Arabic (‫)تتعهد الدول األطراف‬. This structure
shift was obligatory as the English sentence structure starts with the subject
(subject+verb+object) whereas the Arabic structure starts with the verb (verb+subject+object).
The second structure shift occurred in the modifier+head word order as the English
phrase (appropriate and active means), containing two modifiers and a head, was rendered into
a head followed by the two modifiers (‫)الوسائل المالئمة والفعالة‬. This shift was obligatory because
of the structural disparities between English and Arabic.
Example4:
ST: Instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the
United Nations.
TT:

.‫وتودع صكوك التصديق لدى األمين العام لألمم المتحدة‬

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

58

In this example, two structure shifts were identified. The first one is a shift in subjectverb sentence structure. The subject+verb order in (Instruments of ratification {noun phrase}
shall be deposited {verb phrase}) was reversed into a verb+subject order in Arabic ( ‫تودع صكوك‬
‫)التصديق‬. The second shift took place when the modifier+head word order in English (United
Nations) was changed into a head+ modifier in Arabic (‫)لألمم المتحدة‬. The first shift was
obligatory as the English sentence structure starts with the subject (subject+verb+object)
whereas the Arabic structure starts with the verb (verb+subject+object). The second shift was
obligatory too because of the structural differences between English and Arabic.
4.1.2.1.2 Shifts in Verbal-nominal Sentence Structure
This subcategory of structure shifts refers to the change in the sentence structure from
a verbal sentence in the ST to a nominal (i.e. verbless) sentence in the TT. The following
examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: Recognizing that the United Nations has, in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and in the International Covenants on Human Rights, proclaimed and agreed
that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein,
TT:

‫ في اإلعالن العالمي لحقوق اإلنسان وفى العهدين الدوليين‬،‫وإذا تدرك أن األمم المتحدة قد أعلنت‬
‫ أن لكل إنسان حق التمتع بجميع الحقوق والحريات الواردة في تلك‬،‫الخاصين بحقوق اإلنسان‬
،‫الصكوك‬

As underlined in this example, there is a shift in sentence structure from verbal to
nominal case. English sentences are always verbal and cannot be meaningful without a verb.
Arabic sentences, however, have two sentence structures, verbal and nominal, and both can
similarly convey a meaningful message. In this example, the English sentence (everyone is

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

59

entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein) contains the verb ‘is’. The translator
shifted this verbal sentence into a nominal sentence in Arabic as in (....‫)لكل إنسان حق التمتع‬. This
shift was optional as the meaning can also be conveyed through the following verbal sentence
in Arabic (...‫)يحق لكل إنسان التمتع‬.
Example2:
ST: Recalling that, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations
has proclaimed that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance,
TT:

‫وإذ تشير إلى أن األمم المتحدة قد أعلنت في اإلعالن العالمي لحقوق اإلنسان أن للطفولة الحق في‬
،‫رعاية ومساعدة خاصتين‬

‫والرعاية‬
‫الحماية‬The
‫للطفل‬translator
‫تضمن‬
In this example, there is a shift in the verbal-nominal sentence
structure.
changed the English verbal sentence (childhood is entitled to...), which contains the verb ‘is’,
into a nominal sentence in Arabic (‫)للطفولة الحق‬. This shift was optional as the translator can
transfer the same meaning using the following verbal sentence Arabic (...‫)يحق للطفولة تلقي‬.
Example3:
ST: Recognizing that, in all countries in the world, there are children living in
exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such children need special consideration,
TT:

،‫ أطفاال يعيشون في ظروف صعبة للغاية‬،‫ في جميع بلدان العالم‬،‫وإذ تسلم بأن ثمة‬

In the above example, a verbal-nominal sentence structure shift occurred. The English
verbal sentence (there are children), containing the verb ‘are’, was translated into a nominal
ً
sentence in Arabic (‫أطفاال‬
‫)ثمة‬. This shift was optional because the same message can be
conveyed in a verbal sentence in Arabic, such as (...‫)يوجد أطفال‬.

4.1.2.1.3 Passive-active Voice shifts
In this subcategory of structure shifts, a change from the passive voice in the ST to the
active voice in the TT, and vice versa, takes place. The following examples provide further
explanation:
Example1:
ST: States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible
for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by
competent authorities,
TT:

‫تكفل الدول األطراف أن تتقيد المؤسسات واإلدارات والمرافق المسؤولة عن رعاية أو حماية األطفال‬
،‫بالمعايير التي وضعتها السلطات المختصة‬

This example includes a structure shift from passive to active voice. The translator
changed the sentence voice from passive in the ST (established by competent authorities) to
active in the TT (‫)وضعتها السلطات المختصة‬. In this sentence, the English passive structure
(V3+by+agent) was transferred into an Arabic active structure (verb+agent). This shift was
obligatory because the agent is mentioned in the ST sentence, which makes it preferable to use
the active voice in Arabic.
Example2:
ST: The members of the Committee shall be elected by States Parties from among their
nationals and shall serve in their personal capacity,
TT:

،‫وتنتخب الدول األطراف أعضاء اللجنة من بين رعاياها ويعمل هؤالء األعضاء بصفتهم الشخصية‬

As observed in the example above, there is a structure shift in sentence voice from
passive into active. The passive voice in the ST (elected by States Parties) was changed to the
active voice in the TT (‫)وتنتخب الدول األطراف‬. In this sentence, the English passive structure

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

61

(V3+by+agent) was transferred into an Arabic active structure (verb+agent). The translator
changed the voice from passive to active because the performer of the action is mentioned in
the ST, i.e. ‘States Parties’. Hence, this shift was obligatory as the Arabic language has
preference for the use of active voice if the agent is known.
Example3:
ST: Any amendment adopted by a majority of States Parties present and voting at the
conference shall be submitted to the General Assembly for approval.
TT:

‫ويقدم أي تعديل تعتمده أغلبية من الدول األطراف الحاضرة والمصوتة في المؤتمر إلى الجمعية العامة‬
.‫إلقراره‬

In this example, a structure shift in sentence voice from passive into active was
observed. The passive sentence (adopted by a majority of States Parties) in the ST was
transferred into an active sentence in the TT (‫)تعتمده أغلبية من الدول األطراف‬. In this sentence, the
English passive structure (V3+by+agent) was transferred into an Arabic active structure
(verb+agent). This shift was obligatory since the agent is known and the Arabic language favors
using the active voice in this case. The following table listed the statistics of all observed
structure shifts:

4.1.2.2 Unit Shifts
Catford (1965) refers to unit shifts as the changes in the unit of language. This kind of
shifts constitutes altering the SL rank into another different TL rank. For instance, a word in
the ST can be changed into a morpheme, phrase, clause, or sentence in the TT. Each of these
ranks can be changed into the other for the purpose of achieving textual equivalence. To clarify
this type of shifts, the following examples were provided.
4.1.2.2.1 Word to morpheme
This type of unit shifts constitutes a change from a word in the ST to a bound morpheme
in the TT. The following examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child,
"the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and
care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth",
TT:

‫ يحتاج إلى إجراءات وقاية‬،‫ بسبب عدم نضجه البدني والعقلي‬،‫وإذ تضع في اعتبارها "أن الطفل‬
‫ قبل الوالدة وبعدها" وذلك كما جاء في إعالن‬،‫ بما في ذلك حماية قانونية مناسبة‬،‫ورعاية خاصة‬
،‫حقوق الطفل‬

In this example, a unit shift from a word in the ST to a morpheme in the TT was
identified. As underlined, the word (his) in the ST was shifted into a bound morpheme ‘‫ ’هـ‬at
the end of the word (‫ )نضجه‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory because the equivalent of the
masculine pronoun (his) in Arabic is the bound morpheme (‫)هـ‬.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

63

Example2:
ST: For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being
below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority
is attained earlier.
TT:

‫ ما لم يبلغ سن الرشد قبل‬،‫ يعنى الطفل كل إنسان لم يتجاوز الثامنة عشرة‬،‫ألغراض هذه االتفاقية‬
.‫ذلك بموجب القانون المنطبق عليه‬

This example includes a unit shift from a word in the ST to a morpheme in the TT. The
translator changed the word (for) in the ST to the bound morpheme ‘‫ ’لـ‬in the word (‫ )ألغراض‬in
the TT. This shift was obligatory because the Arabic equivalent of the preposition (for) in this
context is the bound morpheme ‘‫’لـ‬.
Example3:
ST: The members of the Committee shall be elected by secret ballot from a list of
persons nominated by States Parties.
TT:

،‫ينتخب أعضاء اللجنة باالقتراع السري من قائمة أشخاص ترشحهم الدول األطراف‬

In this example, a unit shift from a word in the ST into a morpheme in the TT was
detected. As underlined in the example above, the word (by) in the ST was rendered into the
bound morpheme ‘‫ ’بـ‬in (‫ )باالقتراع‬in the TT. In this case, the shift was optional because the word
(by) can also be translated using a word such as ‘‫ ’عبر‬or a phrase such as ‘‫ ’من خالل‬and ‘ ‫عن‬
‫’طريق‬.
Example4:
ST: The present Convention is subject to ratification.
TT:

.‫تخضع هذه االتفاقية للتصديق‬

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

64

This example includes a unit shift from a word in the ST to a morpheme in the TT.
The word (to) in the ST was rendered into the bound morpheme ‘‫ ’لـ‬in (‫ )للتصديق‬in the TT. The
shift in this case was obligatory because the meaning of the preposition ‘to’ in this context
can only be transferred using the bound preposition ‘‫ ’لـ‬in Arabic.
4.1.2.2.2 Word to phrase
This type of unit shifts refers to the change from a word in the ST to a phrase (i.e. more
than one word) in the TT. The following examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: Considering that the child should be fully prepared to live an individual life in
society, and brought up in the spirit of the ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United
Nations,
TT:

‫وإذ ترى أنه ينبغي إعداد الطفل إعدادا كامال ليحيا حياة فردية في المجتمع وتربيته بروح المثل العليا‬
،‫المعلنة في ميثاق األمم المتحدة‬

This example includes two unit shifts from a word in the ST into a phrase in the TT. In
the first case, the word (fully), which is an adverb, in the ST was translated into the noun phrase
ً
(‫كامال‬
‫ )إعدادًا‬in the TT. The second unit shift took place in the translation of the SL word (ideals),
which is a noun, into the TL noun phrase (‫)المثل العليا‬. Both unit shifts were optional as they both
can be translated using single words in Arabic, such as ‘‫ ’ ُكليًّا‬for (fully) and ‘‫ ’المثاليات‬for ideals,
but the translator preferred to render them into phrases.
Example2:
ST: States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention
to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective
of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS
TT:

65

‫تحترم الدول األطراف الحقوق الموضحة في هذه االتفاقية وتضمنها لكل طفل يخضع لواليتها دون أي‬
‫ بغض النظر عن عنصر الطفل أو والديه‬،‫نوع من أنواع التمييز‬

In this pair of sentences, a unit shift from a word in the ST to a phrase in the TT was
discovered. The English word (irrespective), which is an adjective, was translated into the
prepositional phrase (‫ )بغض النظر‬in Arabic. This shift was obligatory because the meaning of
the English word (irrespective) can only be translated using a phrase in Arabic as there is no
Arabic word containing the same meaning.
Example3:
ST: States Parties undertake to make the principles and provisions of the Convention
widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.
TT:

،‫تتعهد الدول األطراف بأن تنشر مبادئ االتفاقية وأحكامها على نطاق واسع بالوسائل المالئمة والفعالة‬
.‫بين الكبار واألطفال على السواء‬

This example includes two unit shifts from a word in the ST into a phrase in the TT.
The first one was a shift from the word (widely), which is an adverb, in the ST into the
prepositional phrase (‫ )على نطاق واسع‬in the TT. The second one was a shift from the word (alike),
which is an adverb, in the ST into the prepositional phrase (‫ )على السواء‬in the TT. Both unit shifts
were obligatory because both English adverbs can only be rendered into Arabic using phrases.
Example4:
ST: In the event that, within four months from the date of such communication, at least
one third of the States Parties favour such a conference, the Secretary-General shall
convene the conference under the auspices of the United Nations.
TT:

‫ عقد‬،‫ في غضون أربعة أشهر من تاريخ هذا التبليغ‬،‫وفى حالة تأييد ثلث الدول األطراف على األقل‬
.‫ يدعو األمين العام إلى عقده تحت رعاية األمم المتحدة‬،‫هذا المؤتمر‬

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

66

This pair of sentences contains a unit shift from a word in the ST into a phrase in the
TT. The English word (within), which is a preposition, in the ST was rendered into the Arabic
prepositional phase (‫ )في غضون‬in the TT. This shift was optional because the English
preposition (within) can be correctly translated into one word, such ‘‫’خالل‬.
4.1.2.2.3 Word to clause
This type of unit shifts constitutes a change from a word in the ST to a clause (i.e a
grammatical unit consisting of a subject and predicate) in the TT. The following examples
provide further explanation:
Example:
ST: Bearing in mind that the need to extend particular care to the child has been stated
in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924 and in the Declaration of
the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1959
TT:

‫وإذ تضع في اعتبارها أن الحاجة إلى توفير رعاية خاصة للطفل قد ذكرت في إعالن جنيف لحقوق‬
‫نوفمبر‬/‫ تشرين الثاني‬20 ‫ وفى إعالن حقوق الطفل الذي اعتمدته الجمعية العامة في‬1924 ‫الطفل لعام‬
1959

There is a unit shift from a word to a clause in this example. The SL word (adopted)
was translated into the TL clause (‫)الذي اعتمدته‬. This unit shift from a word to a clause was
optional since the word (adopted) can be translated and still be meaningful using other
structures, such as ‘‫’المعتمد‬.
4.1.2.2.4 Word to sentence
This type of unit shifts constitutes a change from a word in the ST to a sentence in the
TT. The following examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: They shall be eligible for re-election if renominated.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS
TT:

67

.‫ويجوز إعادة انتخابهم إذا جرى ترشيحهم من جديد‬

This pair of sentences includes a unit shift from a word in the ST into a sentence in the
TT. The translator changed the English word (renominated) in the ST to the Arabic sentence
(‫ )جرى ترشيحهم من جديد‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory because the English word
(renominated) is a past participle forming the passive tense and also consists of the prefix ‘re’, which means ‘to do again’. These implied meanings can only be rendered by a sentence in
Arabic.
4.1.2.2.5 Phrase to word
This type of unit shifts constitutes a change from a phrase (i.e. more than one word) in
the ST to a single word in the TT. The following examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: Bearing in mind that the peoples of the United Nations have, in the Charter,
reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the
human person,
TT:

‫وإذا تضع في اعتبارها أن شعوب األمم المتحدة قد أكدت من جديد في الميثاق إيمانها بالحقوق‬
،‫األساسية لإلنسان وبكرامة الفرد وقدره‬

This example contains a structure shift in which a phrase in the ST was changed into a
word in the TT. As underlined, the noun phrase (the human person) in the ST was translated
into the word (‫ )الفرد‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory because literal translation of this noun
phrase (‫ )الشخص البشري‬is meaningless in Arabic.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

68

Example2:
ST: States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents,
TT:

‫تحترم الدول األطراف مسؤوليات وحقوق وواجبات الوالدين‬

In the above example, a structure shift from a phrase in the ST to a word in the TT was
discovered. The English verb phrase (shall respect) in the ST was translated into the word
(‫ )تحترم‬in the TT. This shift was optional as the use of shall in legal texts is not to indicate the
future tense but to impose legal obligation. So, the verb ‘shall’ in legal texts can be either
dropped in translation or translated into verbs conveying obligation such as ‘‫’تلتزم‬.
Example3:
ST: Each State Party may nominate one person from among its own nationals.
TT:

.‫ولكل دولة طرف أن ترشح شخصا واحدا من بين رعاياها‬

This pair of sentences contain a unit shift from a phrase in the ST into a word in the
TT. The noun phrase (its own nationals) in the TT was rendered into a single word (‫ )رعاياها‬in
the TT. This shift was obligatory because the Arabic language uses bound morphemes, such
as the bound morpheme ‘‫ ’ها‬in (‫ )رعاياها‬to refer to possessiveness as in ‘its own’.
Example4:
ST: In the event that, within four months from the date of such communication, at least
one third of the States Parties favour such a conference, the Secretary-General shall
convene the conference under the auspices of the United Nations.
TT:

‫ عقد‬،‫ في غضون أربعة أشهر من تاريخ هذا التبليغ‬،‫وفى حالة تأييد ثلث الدول األطراف على األقل‬
.‫ يدعو األمين العام إلى عقده تحت رعاية األمم المتحدة‬،‫هذا المؤتمر‬

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

69

In this example, a unit shift from a phrase in the ST into a word in the TT was identified.
The English noun phrase (one third) was translated into a single word (‫ )ثلث‬in Arabic. This shift
was obligatory as the equivalent meaning of this English noun phrase is a single word in Arabic.
4.1.2.2.6 Sentence to word
This type of unit shifts constitutes a change from a sentence in the ST to a single word
in the TT. The following examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: An amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of the present article shall
enter into force when it has been approved by the General Assembly of the United
Nations and accepted by a two thirds majority of States Parties.
TT:

‫ من هذه المادة عندما تقره الجمعية العامة لألمم المتحدة‬1 ‫يبدأ نفاذ أي تعديل يتم اعتماده وفقا لـلفقرة‬
.‫وتقبله الدول األطراف في هذه االتفاقية بأغلبية الثلثين‬

In this example, a unit shift from a sentence in the ST into a word in the TT occurred.
The translator changed the sentence (it has been approved) in the English text into a single
word (‫ )تقره‬in the Arabic text. This shift was obligatory because the Arabic grammar implies
the subject and verb tense in a single word. The following table listed the statistics of all
observed unit shifts:

4.1.2.3 Class Shifts
Class shifts occur when there is a change from one part of speech in the ST to another
in the TT (Catford, 1965). This kind of shifts constitutes an alteration in the word class,
including verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, …etc., between the ST and the TT. The following
are examples covering different types of class shifts.
Example1:
ST: Bearing in mind that the peoples of the United Nations have, in the Charter,
reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the
human person, and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of
life in larger freedom,
TT:

‫وإذا تضع في اعتبارها أن شعوب األمم المتحدة قد أكدت من جديد في الميثاق إيمانها بالحقوق‬
‫ وعقدت العزم على أن تدفع بالرقى االجتماعي قدما وترفع‬،‫األساسية لإلنسان وبكرامة الفرد وقدره‬
،‫مستوى الحياة في جو من الحرية أفسح‬

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

71

This pair of sentences includes a class shift from the adjective (better) in the ST to the
verb (‫ )ترفع‬in the TT. This shift was optional as the meaning of the ST words can be fulfilled
using a word belonging to the same class in the TT such as the adjective ‘‫ ’أفضل‬in “ ‫وتحقق مستويات‬
‫”معيشية أفضل‬.
Example2:
ST: States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary
for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents,
legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end,
shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures.
TT:

‫ مراعية حقوق وواجبات‬،‫تتعهد الدول األطراف بأن تضمن للطفل الحماية والرعاية الالزمتين لرفاهه‬
‫ جميع‬،‫ تحقيقا لهذا الغرض‬،‫ وتتخذ‬،‫والديه أو أوصيائه أو غيرهم من األفراد المسؤولين قانونا عنه‬
.‫التدابير التشريعية واإلدارية المالئمة‬

In this example, two class shifts were identified. The first class shift constitutes a
change from the adverb (legally) in the ST to the noun (‫ )قانونا‬in the TT. This shift was
obligatory due to the grammatical differences between English and Arabic in the use of
adverbs. In English, adverbs can be used to modify adjectives; nevertheless, adverbs are used
in Arabic to modify verbs only. The second class shift occurred in the translation of the
adjective (all) in the ST to the noun (‫ )جميع‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory because an
adjective textual equivalent of ‘all’ in Arabic does not exist.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

72

Example3:
ST: For the purpose of examining the progress made by States Parties in achieving the
realization of the obligations undertaken in the present Convention, there shall be
established a Committee on the Rights of the Child, which shall carry out the functions
hereinafter provided.
TT:

‫تنشأ لغرض دراسة التقدم الذي أحرزته الدول األطراف في استيفاء تنفيذ االلتزامات التي تعهدت بها‬
.‫في هذه االتفاقية لجنة معنية بحقوق الطفل تضطلع بالوظائف المنصوص عليها فيما يلي‬

In this example, three different class shifts were observed. The first shift occurred when
the translator changed the part of speech of the word (present) from an adjective in the ST to a
pronoun the TT, which is (‫)هذه‬. This shift was optional because the ST adjective can be
translated into an Arabic adjective such as ‘‫’االتفاقيّة الحاليّة‬.
The second class shift was the shift from a past participle (established) functioning as
an adjective in the ST into the verb (‫ )تنشأ‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory as the structure
of an auxiliary verb followed by a past participle functioning as an adjective does not exist in
Arabic. Hence, it had to be changed into a verb to fit the Arabic structure.
In the third case as underlined, the preposition (on) in the ST was rendered into the
adjective (‫ )معنية‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory because the English uses prepositions to
mean ‘concerning’ or ‘regarding’; this, however, does not apply to Arabic. Thus, it was
obligatory to resort to a class shift to maintain the meaning.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

73

Example4:
ST: The present Convention shall be open for signature by all States.
TT:

.‫يفتح باب التوقيع على هذه االتفاقية لجميع الدول‬

This pair of sentences includes three different types of class shifts. The first class shift
took place in the translation of the adjective (present) in the ST into the pronoun (‫ )هذه‬in the
TT. This shift was optional because the ST adjective can be translated into an Arabic adjective
such as ‘‫’االتفاقيّة الحاليّة‬.
The second shift occurred in the translation of the adjective (open) in the ST into the
verb (‫ )يفتح‬in the TT. This shift was optional because the translator preferred to omit the verbal
phrase (shall be) and replace it with the verb (to open) from the adjective (open) in Arabic
instead of maintaining the same part of speech of (open) as in the Arabic adjectives ‘‫مفتو ًحا‬/‫’متا ًحا‬
in ‘‫مفتو ًحا‬/‫’يلزم أن يكون باب التوقيع على هذه االتفاقية متا ًحا‬.
The third class shift in this pair of sentences occurred in the translation of the adjective
(all) in the ST to the noun (‫ )جميع‬in the TT. This shift was obligatory because an adjective
textual equivalent of ‘all’ in Arabic does not exist. The following table listed the statistics of
all observed classed shifts:

4.1.2.4 Intra-System Shifts
Intra-system translation shifts occur when there is no equivalence for a source language
term in the target language system (Catford, 1965). This kind of Catford’s shift usually occur
when the ST and the TT have somewhat similar linguistic systems; however, there is a
preference for the use of the systematically different term in the TL. For example, both English
and Arabic use singular and plural forms; however, sometimes a plural noun in English is
textually used in the singular form in Arabic and vice versa. This also applies to definite vs.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

75

indefinite words and possessive vs. genitive forms. The following examples present an
explanation for this type of translation shifts.
4.1.2.4.1 Definite-indefinite
This type of intra-system shifts constitutes a change from a definite word in the ST to
an indefinite word in the TT and vice versa. The following examples provide further
explanation:
Example1:
ST: Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly
resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989
TT:

‫اعتمدت وعرضت للتوقيع والتصديق واالنضمام بموجب قرار الجمعية العامة لألمم المتحدة رقم‬
1989 ‫نوفمبر‬/‫ تشرين الثاني‬20 ‫ لألمم المتحدة المؤرخ في‬25/44

This example includes a sequence of intra-system shifts from indefinite nouns in the
ST (signature, ratification and accession) to definite nouns in the TT (‫)للتوقيع والتصديق واالنضمام‬.
In the English abstract words, definite articles were not used due to grammatical rules and the
reflection of a generic reference. Nonetheless, the definite Arabic article (‫ )الـ‬was attached to
the three Arabic equivalents of the indefinite English words. This shift was obligatory due to
the differences in linguistic systems between English and Arabic.
Example2:
ST: States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life.
TT:

.‫تعترف الدول األطراف بأن لكل طفل حقا أصيال في الحياة‬

In this example, two intra-system shifts were observed. The first one is a shift from a
definite phrase in the ST (the inherent right) to an indefinite phrase in the TT (‫)حقا أصيال‬. This
shift was optional as both definite and indefinite forms are acceptable in this context and would

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

76

not affect the meaning. The second intra-system shift is the shift from an indefinite word in the
ST (life) to a definite phrase in the TT (‫)الحياة‬, which is preceded by the bound Arabic article
(‫)الـ‬. This shift was obligatory as the English word ‘life’ is abstract and does not require to be
preceded by a definite article while the Arabic linguistic system uses the definite article (‫)الـ‬
before the word ‘‫ ’حياة‬because it refers to a certain notion. The following are similar examples
of intra-system shifts from indefinite words in in the ST into definite words in the TT:
Example3:
ST: The term of five of the members elected at the first election shall expire at the end
of two years; immediately after the first election, the names of these five members shall
be chosen by lot by the Chairman of the meeting.
TT:

‫ وبعد‬،‫غير أن مدة والية خمسة من األعضاء المنتخبين في االنتخاب األول تنقضي بانقضاء سنتين‬
.‫االنتخاب األول مباشرة يقوم رئيس االجتماع باختيار أسماء هؤالء األعضاء الخمسة بالقرعة‬

Example4:
ST: The instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the
United Nations.
TT:

.‫وتودع صكوك االنضمام لدى األمين العام لألمم المتحدة‬

4.1.2.4.2 Grammatical Number Categories
This type of intra-system shifts constitutes a change in the grammatical number
categories (i.e. singular, dual, and plural) between the ST and the TT. The following
examples provide further explanation:
Example1:
ST: Recalling the provisions of the Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating
to the Protection and Welfare of Children, …. the United Nations Standard Minimum

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

77

Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules); and the
Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed
Conflict,
TT:

،‫وإذ تشير إلى أحكام اإلعالن المتعلق بالمبادئ االجتماعية والقانونية المتصلة بحماية األطفال ورعايتهم‬
‫ وإلى اإلعالن‬،)‫ وإلى قواعد األمم المتحدة الدنيا النموذجية إلدارة شئون قضاء األحداث (قواعد بكين‬....
،‫بشأن حماية النساء واألطفال أثناء الطوارئ والمنازعات المسلحة‬

In this example, three intra-system shifts from words in the singular form in the ST into
words in the plural form in the TT were detected. The first one is a shift from the singular ST
word (Juvenile) to the plural TT word (‫)األحداث‬. The second shift occurred in the translation of
the singular ST word (Emergency) to the plural TT word (‫)الطوارئ‬. The third one is a shift from
the singular ST word (Conflict) to the plural TT word (‫)المنازعات‬.
The first intra-system shift from singular to plural was obligatory as the English noun
‘Juvenile’ is functioning as an adjective and hence is used in the singular form. In Arabic,
however, the meaning is fulfilled in the use of the plural form. The second intra-system shift
was obligatory too in order to maintain the meaning. The third intra-system shift was optional
as both TT singular and plural forms preserve the same meaning and effect.
Example2:
ST: States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents,
TT:

‫تحترم الدول األطراف مسؤوليات وحقوق وواجبات الوالدين‬

In the example above, an intra-system shift from plural to dual was observed. The
translator changed the ST word (parents) from the plural form to the dual form in the TT word
(‫)الوالدين‬. This shift was obligatory because the plural ‘s’ refers to the two parents and while the
dual form is absent in English, it is used in Arabic.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

78

Example3:
ST: The Secretary-General shall subsequently prepare a list in alphabetical order of all
persons thus nominated, indicating States Parties which have nominated them, and shall
submit it to the States Parties to the present Convention.
TT:

‫ثم يعد األمين العام قائمة مرتبة ترتيبا ألفبائيا بجميع األشخاص المرشحين على هذا النحو مبينا الدول‬
.‫ ويبلغها إلى الدول األطراف في هذه االتفاقية‬،‫األطراف التي رشحتهم‬

In this example, an intra-system shift from a singular word in the ST into a plural one
in the TT was observed. The English singular word (nominated) was rendered into the word
(‫ )المرشحين‬in the plural form in Arabic. In English, adjectives, such as (nominated) are always
used in the singular form even if the noun they modify is plural. Adjectives in Arabic, however,
follow the noun they modify in number, definiteness or indefiniteness, and gender. Therefore,
this shift was obligatory to suit the Arabic grammar.
Example4:
ST: the Secretary-General shall convene the conference under the auspices of the
United Nations.
TT:

.‫يدعو األمين العام إلى عقده تحت رعاية األمم المتحدة‬

This pair of sentences includes an intra-system shift from a plural word in the ST into
a singular one in the TT. The English plural word (auspices) was rendered into the singular
word (‫ )رعاية‬in Arabic. This shift was obligatory because the textual equivalence of the English
plural noun is used in Arabic in the singular form.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

79

4.1.2.4.3 Possessive-genitive case
This type of intra-system shifts constitutes a change from the possessive case (i.e.
Noun+’s) in the ST to the genitive case in the TT. The following examples provide further
explanation:
Example1:
ST: States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention
to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective
of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language,
religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability,
birth or other status.
TT:

‫تحترم الدول األطراف الحقوق الموضحة في هذه االتفاقية وتضمنها لكل طفل يخضع لواليتها دون أي‬
‫ بغض النظر عن عنصر الطفل أو والديه أو الوصي القانوني عليه أو لونهم أو‬،‫نوع من أنواع التمييز‬
‫ أو‬،‫جنسهم أو لغتهم أو دينهم أو رأيهم السياسي أو غيره أو أصلهم القومي أو اإلثني أو االجتماعي‬
.‫ أو أي وضع آخر‬،‫ أو مولدهم‬،‫ أو عجزهم‬،‫ثروتهم‬

This pair of sentences includes a series of intra-system shifts from the possessive form
in the ST to the genitive form in the TT as underlined in the above example. The possessive
phrase (the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race) in the ST was translated into
the genitive form (‫)عنصر الطفل أو والديه أو الوصي القانوني عليه‬. This is followed by a number of other
similar intra-system shifts such as the translation of the possessive form in (the child's or his or
her parent's or legal guardian's…, colour) into the genitive form in (‫ )لونهم‬in the TT. The
possessive nouns ‘the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's’ were translated into the
genitive bound morpheme ‘‫ ’هم‬in ‘‫’لونهم‬. These shifts are obligatory due to differences in the
English and Arabic grammatical systems.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

80

Example2:
ST: States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected
against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities,
expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members.
TT:

‫تتخذ الدول األطراف جميع التدابير المناسبة لتكفل للطفل الحماية من جميع أشكال التمييز أو العقاب‬
‫ أو أنشطتهم أو‬،‫القائمة على أساس مركز والدي الطفل أو األوصياء القانونيين عليه أو أعضاء األسرة‬
. ‫آرائهم المعبر عنها أو معتقداتهم‬

In this example, an intra-system shift from the possessive form in the ST to the genitive
form in the TT has occurred. The translator changed the possessive phrase (child's parents) in
the ST to the genitive phrase (‫ )والدي الطفل‬in the TT. This shift is obligatory due to the
grammatical differences between English and Arabic as the possessive form in English is
expressed using the genitive form in the TT. The following table listed the statistics of all
observed intra-system shifts:

4.2 Study Findings
4.2.1 Findings regarding the first research question
In this paper, the researcher analyzed the Arabic translation of the UN’s Convention on
the Rights of the Child from English (1989) adopting a descriptive quantitative approach. The
model of Catford’s translation shifts was applied to the Arabic translated text in comparison
with its original English text. All translation shifts in line with Catford’s model were traced
and manually counted as shown in the table below.

According to the table above, all five types of Catford’s translation shifts were observed
in the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) from English into
Arabic scoring a total of 653 shifts. The most frequent type of Catford’s shifts was intra-system
shifts with the frequency of 174 shifts, representing 26.6% of all observed translation shifts.
Among intra-system shifts, definite-indefinite shifts were the most frequent (=139 shifts) as
indicated in Table6. This was followed by shifts of grammatical numbers with the frequency
of 24 shifts. Possessive-genitive shifts were the least frequent among intra-system shifts (=11
shifts).
The second most frequent type of translation shifts was unit shifts scoring 26.3% (=171
shifts) of total translation shifts with a very slight difference (=0.3% difference) from intrasystem shifts. As illustrated in Table4, shifts from phrases to words were the most frequent
among unit shifts with the frequency of 71 shifts. Shifts from words to morphemes were the

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

82

second in frequency among unit shifts scoring 52 shifts. This was followed by shifts from
words to phrases with the frequency of 45 shifts. Finally, shifts from words to clauses, shifts
from words to sentences, and shifts from sentences to words were the least frequent subcategories among unit shifts with the frequency of one time each.
The third most frequent type of translation shifts was structure shifts with the
percenyage of 24.6% (=161 shifts). As indicated in Table3, structure shifts in word order were
the most frequent with 142 observed shifts. Structure shifts in passive-active sentence voice
occurred only 16 times being second in place among structure shifts. Lastly, verbal-nominal
sentence structure shifts rarely occurred with the frequency of 3 shifts only.
The fourth most frequent type of translation shifts was class shifts which were identified
128 times (=19.6%). As provided in Table5, twelve sub-category of class shifts were observed
in the Arabic translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). The most
frequent sub-category of class shifts was shifts from adjectives in the ST to nouns in the TT
with the frequency of 38 shifts. In the contrary, the least frequent subcategory of class shifts
was shifts from nouns to adjectives occurring only once.
Finally, the least frequent type of translation shifts was level shifts with the frequency
of 19 shifts (=2.9%). According to Table2, both level shifts from grammar to lexis and from
lexis to grammar were almost similar in frequency with the former occurring for 9 times and
the latter being observed 10 times.
To sum up, all five types of Catford’s translation shifts were observed in the Arabic
translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). The first two most
frequent translation shifts, namely intra-system shifts (=26.6%), unit shifts (=26.3%), were
highly close in percentage, with a slight difference of 0.3% only. These were followed by

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

83

structure shifts (=24.6%), then class shifts (=19.6%). Finally, there was a dramatic drop in the
frequency of translation shifts of level shifts with the percentage of 2.9% only.
4.2.2 Findings regarding the second research Question
In the present study, the researcher investigated whether each observed shift throughout
the analysis of the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) from
English into Arabic was obligatory or optional. The collected data on the frequency of both
obligatory and optional translation shifts were presented in the table below.

Based on the statistics presented in the table above, it was concluded that resorting to
translation shifts in the translation of legal texts, represented by the UN’s Convention on the
Rights of the Child (1989), from English into Arabic was mostly obligatory with the percentage
of 80.1% (=523 shifts). On the other hand, only 19.9% (=130 shifts) of translation shifts were
optional as the translator made the choice to reflect these changes due to their preference.
Regarding the detailed specification of the inevitability of resorting to each type of
Catford’s shifts in the study sample, 16 cases (=84.2%) of level shifts were obligatory whereas
only 3 cases (=15.8%) were optional. As for structure shifts, 138 shifts (=85.7%) were
obligatory and only 23 (=14.3%) were optional. Regarding unit shifts, 105 (=61.4%) of
observed shifts were obligatory and 66 (=38.6%) were optional. For Class shifts, 98 (=76.5%)
of detected shifts were obligatory and 30 (=23.5%) were optional. Finally, 166 (=95.4%) of
observed intra-system shifts were obligatory and only 8 (=4.6%) were optional.

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

84

From this analysis, it can be demonstrated that translation shifts were predominantly
inevitable in the absence of formal correspondence in the translation of legal texts from English
into Arabic due to the grammatical and cultural gaps between English and Arabic. Such
obligatory shifts were applied to maintain the meaning and effect of the ST in the TT.
Furthermore, it can be observed that, in legal translation, the translator does not have the luxury
to change and apply personal touches; instead, one has to adhere to the straightforward nature
of legal texts.

Chapter Five: Conclusions and Recommendations

This chapter is composed of two sections: the conclusion and recommendations. The
conclusion section aims at providing a summary for the study on the application of Catford’s
translation shifts to the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)
from English into Arabic and shedding light on the study findings. The second section, the
recommendations, presents suggestions and recommendations for future research on relevant
topics based on the findings of the study.
5.1 Conclusions
This research was conducted to investigate the translation shifts that occur in the
translation of legal texts from English into Arabic. Catford’s model of translation shift
taxonomy was applied to the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child
(1989) from English into Arabic. The objectives of the study were discovering the frequency
of Catford’s translation shifts in the Arabic translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights
of the Child (1989) and the inevitability of resorting to such shifts. To meet the study objectives,
the researcher analyzed the Arabic translation and identified the translation shifts, then
manually counted the frequency of each. The researcher also examined whether each shift was
obligatory or optional.
In spite of the small number of TT sentences, it was noticed that, in the majority of
sentences, all the five types of Catford’s translation shifts occurred. This large number, in fact,
highlighted the linguistic and cultural disparities between English and Arabic. Based upon the
results of the analysis, it was demonstrated that 653 translation shifts occurred in the Arabic
translation with intra-system shifts being the most frequent translation shift scoring 26.6%
(=174 shifts). Unit shifts came second in rank with the percentage of 26.3% (=171 shifts). This

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

86

was followed by structure shifts 24.6% (=161 shifts), then class shifts 19.6% (=128 shifts), and
finally level shifts 2.9% (=19 shifts).
The other significant finding was related to the inevitability of resorting to translation
shifts in the translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) from English
into Arabic. From the analysis, it was concluded that 80.1% (=523 shifts) of identified
translation shifts were obligatory to preserve the meaning and effect of the ST in the TT due to
the absence of formal correspondence. These obligatory translation shifts took place due to the
gap in language and culture between English and Arabic. On the other hand, only 19.9% (=130
shifts) of all translation shifts were optional. This small number of optional shifts underlines
the technical and strict nature of legal texts, in addition to the limited space for personal
preferences in translating this type of texts.
In conclusion, this research was designed to be a descriptive content-analysis study
focusing on the linguistic changes that take place in the translation of legal texts from English
into Arabic. To trace these changes, Catford’s model of translation shifts was applied to the
translation of the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). Since English and Arabic
belong to distinct language families, a large number of obligatory translation shifts were
observed to bridge the linguistic and cultural gaps between these two languages. Optional shifts
were limited in number due to the technicality of legal texts and the lack of aesthetic function
in this type of texts.
5.2 Recommendations
Based on the analysis and findings of the study, it is recommended that translators get
more exposed to legal texts and familiarize themselves with the strict nature of legal language,
especially in English, whether through university courses or specialized workshops. The
purpose is promoting linguistic understanding of legal texts in the field of translation and how

CATFORD'S TRANSLATION SHIFTS IN LEGAL TEXTS

87

linguistic changes are made to fulfill the ultimate purpose of translation, which is meaningful
communication. Last but not least, further research on the application of Catford’s translation
shifts to all text types in general and in legal texts in particular from English and Arabic and
vice versa is highly recommended.

Preamble
The States Parties to the present Convention,
Considering that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United
Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all
members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,
Bearing in mind that the peoples of the United Nations have, in the Charter, reaffirmed their
faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person, and have
determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
Recognizing that the United Nations has, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in
the International Covenants on Human Rights, proclaimed and agreed that everyone is entitled
to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property,
birth or other status,

Recalling that, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has
proclaimed that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance,
Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment
for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded
the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the
community,
Recognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality,
should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and
understanding,
Considering that the child should be fully prepared to live an individual life in society, and
brought up in the spirit of the ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, and in
particular in the spirit of peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity,
Bearing in mind that the need to extend particular care to the child has been stated in the Geneva
Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924 and in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child
adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1959 and recognized in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (in
particular in articles 23 and 24), in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (in particular in article 10) and in the statutes and relevant instruments of
specialized agencies and international organizations concerned with the welfare of children,
Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, "the child, by
reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including
appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth",
Recalling the provisions of the Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating to the
Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption

Nationally and Internationally; the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the
Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules); and the Declaration on the Protection
of Women and Children in Emergency and Conflict, Recognizing that, in all countries in the
world, there are children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such children
need special consideration,
Taking due account of the importance of the traditions and cultural values of each people for
the protection and harmonious development of the child, Recognizing the importance of
international cooperation for improving the living conditions of children in every country, in
particular in the developing countries,
Have agreed as follows:
