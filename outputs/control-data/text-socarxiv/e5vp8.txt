Abstract
The increasingly popular concept of polarization is used to describe various social phenomena such as political, opinion, health and income polarization. Despite this popularity it
is still debated within disciplines how polarization should be conceptualized and how it
should be measured. In this study I provide a systematic, interdisciplinary overview of the
conceptual and measurement literature on polarization. I first describe the challenge of
conceptualizing polarization, a task that requires taking decisions about how to aggregate
individual positions on one or more scales. Different distributional aspects may matter
and the concept’s meaning is related to the measurement level of the underlying scales.
Subsequently, I review various polarization measures that have been developed during the
last decades.

Introduction

The concept of polarization is discussed in various social science classics and studied across
various disciplines and sub-disciplines in the social sciences (e.g. Ross 1920; Galtung 1966;
Blau 1977; Deutsch 1977; Marx 1867). In political science, for instance, the concept is applied
to attitudes and the concept’s popularity as grown, driven by a more polarized political reality
in the United States. A growing number of empirical studies investigates levels and trends of
political polarization in the United States both on the elite/party level and the level of the public
(e.g. Hetherington 2009, 2009; Layman, Carsey, and Horowitz 2006; Layman and Carsey 2002;
Poole and Rosenthal 1984; Stone, Rapoport, and Abramowitz 1990; Baldassarri and Gelman
2008; Fiorina and Abrams 2008; Fischer and Mattson 2009; Lelkes 2016). More recently,
European scholars have picked up the concept (e.g. Adams, Green, and Milazzo 2012; Adams,
De Vries, and Leiter 2012; Down and Wilson 2010; Munzert and Bauer 2013). Nonetheless,
despite the sizable volume of scholarship on the concept, scholars disagree on how much
political polarization there actually is among elites and the public. The debate on polarization is
itself polarized (Lelkes 2016). Scholars often provide evidence from a series of measures instead
of suggesting one ideal measure (cf. DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson 1996; Fiorina and Abrams
2008; Lelkes 2016). We can find similar debates in related disciplines such as economics.
Broadly speaking, the level of polarization describes to what degree individuals’ positions on one
or several scales are separated.1 A process or trend of (de-)polarization describes how the level
of polarization changes over time. However, the nature of this separation, i.e. to what extent
different characteristics of a distribution reflect the idea of polarization is still subject to debate,
a debate that is linked to the scale(s) that underlie one’s concept of polarization. Scholars arrive
at different conclusions regarding the levels and trends of polarization of different phenomena
and polarization’s impact on other phenomena (e.g. violence) and are also critical of certain
measures (e.g. Downey and Huffman 2001). In part, such differing conclusions are caused by
the use of different conceptualizations and related measures of polarization.
In the present study I pursue the following research question: How can we conceptualize and
measure polarization? In seeking an answer to this question our study contributes to current
scholarship in several ways.
First, I describe the choices necessary when conceptualizing polarization. In doing so I emphasize that this process is ultimately an abstract mathematical task. This task entails choosing
what kind of and how many scales underlie our potential polarization concept and which
distributional characteristics reflect higher/lower levels of polarization. Such characteristics,

I speak of individuals throughout the paper, however, generically we could think of other types of actors such
as firms, parties, countries etc.

2

e.g. the extremeness or clustering of scale positions, have been discussed in more or less explicit
manner in the past. Because it’s an abstract task it is not surprising that measures were coined
with similar characteristics for closely related concepts such as “agreement”. Importantly, as
we study the polarization of different phenomena we may find that different distributional
characteristics matter from a conceptual point of view. For instance, both income and opinion
polarization may lead to conflicts in a group of individuals. However, the income distribution to
cause maximum conflict may differ from the opinion distribution that causes maximum conflict,
requiring different measures of polarization for the two phenomena.
Second, I review current polarization measures. In doing so I extend upon previous reviews in
Sociology, Political Science or Economics (e.g. Fiorina and Abrams 2008; Hetherington 2009)
both by classifying them in a more systematic way and by reviewing measures across disciplines
as well as across subareas such as political, social or health polarization.2 I try to provide a more
systematic perspective by classifying subconcepts and measures of polarization through the set
of choices on which they are based. One such choice, for instance, is whether to incorporate a
single scale or several scales. Thereby, I link formerly separated literatures and review measures
of both unidimensional and multidimensional polarization. Generally, the idea is to provide
scholars with a guide to the concept of polarization and, in doing so, emphasize that the study of
polarization of different phenomena requires a careful consideration of the conceptual aspects
that underlie different measures which in turn are linked to the actual phenomenon we study.
Our review is necessarily selective in its discussion of measures because the literature turned
out to be quite vast.
In Section 2 I start by outlining how polarization is conceptualized and discuss the choices made
in this process as well as the role of measurement levels. In Section 3 I provide an overview
of various polarization subconcepts. In Section 4 I review measures of polarization, both for
unidimensional polarization and for multidimensional polarization. Section 5 provides some
concluding thoughts.

Conceptualizing polarization: A set of choices

The concept of polarization was discussed at various stages throughout the last century. Definitions are rare but helpful. Within peace & conflict research Galtung (1996, 14:90) [1966]
characterizes the concept as follows: “Polarization means reducing [. . . ] conflict formation to
2

While several helpful reviews exist these are often discipline specific and topic specific (see e.g. DiMaggio,
Evans, and Bryson 1996).

the most simplistic level, assigning all m parties to one or the other of two camps, wrapping all
n conflict themes together in one super-theme. All positive, cooperative relations are within the
camps and all negative relations between them [. . . ]”. In economics, Esteban and Ray (2012, 2)
provide a more mathematical and abstract characterization of polarization as “separation or distance across clustered groups in a distribution”. Galtung (1996)’s definition already emphasizes
the element of clustering into (two) groups and the type of relations that should exist within
those groups. Esteban and Ray (2012)’s definition also emphasizes the role of clustering, adds
that there may be more than two clusters and alludes to separation or distance between groups.
The ideas of separation vs. distance come into play when we deal with different, qualitative
or quantitative scale types. Below we’ll present the task of conceptualizing polarization as a
set of choices, discuss the significant role of measurement levels and dimensionality and try to
formulate some general principles.

Fundamentally, conceptualizing and measuring polarization entails several choices as depicted
in Figure 1. First, we have to choose whether we investigate polarization on a single scale or
several scales. Or put differently, whether the type of polarization we are interested is unior multidimensional in nature.3 For instance, income polarization is unidimensional as the
underlying data are positions on a single scale measuring income. In contrast, ethnic income
polarization is twodimensional or multidimensional respectively, as we need data on both a
scale differentiating individuals’ incomes and a scale measuring individuals’ belonging to ethnic
groups.
Second, we have to choose what types of scales flow into our polarization measure, i.e. what
3

Mostly, I use “dimension” and “scale” as synonyms, however at times their meaning slightly differs.

measurement levels we are dealing with. A commonly used classification of measurement
levels distinguishes nominal, ordinal, interval and ration scales as depicted in Figure 2 (Stevens
1946).4 For instance, income is often measured on a ratio level, but may also be measured
on an ordinal scale that assigns individuals to categories. Ethnicity is usually measured on a
nominal scale comprising different ethnic categories. Scholars have developed measures for
different measurement levels.
Third, we have to choose which distributional characteristics reflect polarization. Some may
argue that polarization is represented by a distribution in which many individuals are located
at the extremes of a scale or several scales. Others may suggest that the main aspect is not
extremeness but clustering. When individuals are located in clearly distinguishable clusters,
even if not extreme, we may speak of polarization. If we deem several aspects relevant we
have to make a decision on how to weight them. Naturally, such distributional aspects are
tied to the measurement level of the underlying scales. Subsequently, we have to decide on
how to aggregate individuals’ positions on the scale(s) as to reflect the distributional characteristics we want to pick up both conceptually and in terms of measurement. Different ways
of aggregation emphasize different distributional characteristics. For instance, the variance is
strongly influenced by individuals that are distant from the distributional mean. Ultimately,
a polarization measure will assign uni- or multidimensional distributions values that should
reflect our conceptual idea of polarization.
Fourth, we have too choose which type of actors underlie our concept of polarization. In abstract
terms we can simply speak about units that are distributed across one or several scales. However,
the concept’s meaning may change as we investigate different types of units, such as individuals,
firms, parties etc. The type of unit probably also determines what overall population size we
investigate. The population size in turn may affect what measure we use. For instance, we may
want a polarization measure for small groups (N = 2) to have different characteristics than a
polarization measure for larger groups (N >= 500). In other words, depending on whether we
investigate small group or large group polarization, we may want to adapt any measure we are
using. Generally it is argued that polarization is a matter of groups so that the contribution
of isolated individuals should be negligible (Esteban and Ray 2012, 3).5 However, there are
“small group situations” where a single actor that is distant from others may be responsible for
conflicts or a break down of cooperative relations.
Finally, all of the above choices are linked to the phenomenon we study. For instance, if we
investigate income polarization there are only so many scales types (probably ordinal or higher)
4

Note that there are other classifications of measurement levels.
The literature on party system polarization discusses how the number of parties may affect their incentive to
converge or spread along an ideological continuum (Downs 1957; Dalton 2008).

that make sense when we operationalize and measure polarization. This may change when we
investigate ethnic or opinion polarization.
Once we construct a measure we can use it to assign values/levels of polarization to different
groups of units based on data collected at a particular moment in time t. Given the we have
data across time it may allow us to observe trends/processes of polarization (e.g. DiMaggio,
Evans, and Bryson 1996, 693), i.e. whether the level of polarization of a group of individuals
increases or decreases over time.

Note: Simulated data.

Let’s turn to the notion of measurement levels. When we differentiate characteristics of individuals we assign those individuals to values on a scale. Scales differ in terms of measurement
6

level and a scale’s measurement level determines what conceptualization of polarization we can
have. As we will see below moving up the ladder of measurement levels allows us to add depth
to an eventual conceptualization of polarization. We start our discussion with unidimensional
or single scale polarization.
On nominal scales, see Figure 2 Plot 1a and 1b, the only informative characteristic is category
membership, i.e. we can count the number of individuals in different categories (frequency).
Early scholarly references to polarization seem to be rooted in a nominal view.6 Take for instance
how Ross (1920, 415) refers to polarization: “Sometimes the spirit of faction gains mysteriously
the upper hand and society polarizes into opposing groups which may have no more substantial
basis than the parties of Greens and Blues [. . . ] Generally, however, it is antagonism of economic
interests or ideas which rives society in twain.”. In this view, polarization occurs when people
are separated into categories, along dividing lines. Such dividing lines are also referred to as
cleavages (Lipset and Rokkan 1967; Zuckerman 1975) and Section 6.3 (appendix) discusses
the link between the concepts of polarization and cleavage.7 On a single scale it is often argued
that polarization is highest when individuals are concentrated in two equally sized groups or
categories as in Figure 2 Plot 1b rather than spread across all categories as in Figure 2 Plot 1a
(e.g. Reynal-Querol 2002). Without additional information it would not matter in which two
categories they concentrate. Pervasive spread is also called ‘heterogeneity’ in the respective
literature. The question of how individuals are distributed across categories matters. For
instance, with ethnic polarization we could either argue that it is the situation with two equally
sized ethnic groups that may increase the probability of conflict or the situation in which a
large group dominates and suppresses one or several small groups In other words, it’s not that
simple.
Ordinal scales enhance thinking about polarization. On a ranked scale, categories towards
the opposing endpoints “lie further apart”. Here it matters in which categories individuals
are located. A distributions with many individuals located in the opposite extreme categories,
e.g. extremely dissatisfied and extremely satisfied, as in Figure 2 Plot 2b could be seen as a higher
level of polarization than a concentration in the categories towards the middle as in Figure 2,
Plot 2a. In other words, even without a quantifiable distance between categories, the idea of
dispersion becomes meaningful and it matters in which categories individuals concentrate.
On interval scales, distances between scale values are meaningful. Hence, a potential conception of polarization may incorporate the distance of individuals towards the mean, the scale
endpoints, within and between sub clusters etc. This opens the venue for a whole new set of
6

The cleavage literature often related several scales with each other, e.g. a scale measuring individuals’ center
vs. periphery belonging and a scale measuring vote choice.

measures. In Figure 2 Plot 3a there are no clusters. Visually this is emphasized as each scale
value is represented by a distinct color. However, we could also try to identify sub clusters. In
Figure 2 Plot 3a colors and dashed black lines indicate that individuals with values 0-1, 4-5 and
7-9 belong to sub clusters. Accordingly, a polarization concept can be enhanced by the idea that
clustering in such groups matters. Naturally, such clusters can be pre-specified or identified in
an explorative manner (e.g. by some algorithm or visually).8 Finally, the ratio measurement
level comes with a meaningful zero point and allows comparisons between individuals such
as X’s income is ‘one-half or twice as much’ as Y’s income. To sum up, the measurement level
of the scales we work with determines they way in which we can conceptualize polarization.
Naturally, we could always assume that certain scales have a higher measurement level as is
often done in applied research.
Despite the fact that empirical research primarily focuses on unidimensional polarization, early
theoretical accounts have already emphasized the concept’s multidimensional character. For
instance, it is argued that societal conflict is more likely when polarization extends across
dimensions/scales (Ross 1920, 164), i.e. conflict is more likely when a society polarizes simultaneously along the lines of economic wealth and religious affiliation rather than only in terms
of economic wealth.9 When we move from uniscale to multiscale polarization, we aggregate
positions on scales that may potentially have different measurement levels.
As a quick illustration of the data underlying multidimensional polarization measures, Figure
3 visualizes three examples. Figure 3 Plot 1 visualizes the idea of residential polarization or
geographic polarization (Fiorina and Abrams 2008, 563), namely, that people of a certain
category (e.g. party ID or ethnic background) are concentrated in certain districts of a city.10
It comprises two nominal scales, one differentiating immigrants from non-immigrants and
another one differentiating districts.11 Figure 3, Plot 2 visualizes a two-dimensional distribution
comprising a nominal and an ordinal scale, namely race vs. income. This data and distribution
could constitute the basis for a measure of racial health polarization. Figure 3 Plot 3 visualizes a
three-dimensional distribution comprising three ordinal scales, namely attitudes towards redistribution, gender equality and immigration. Such data underlies measures of multidimensional
8

For instance, Gigliarano and Mosler (2009, 457–58) provide an example with groups that are exogenously
defined. See also Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004, 1738).
9
Ross (1920) also recognizes the fact that the probability of conflict may actually decrease with a rising number
of cross-cutting dividing lines that separate people from each other: “A society, therefore, which is riven by a dozen
oppositions along lines running in every direction, may actually be in less danger of being torn with violence or falling
to pieces than one split along just one line. For each new cleavage contributes to narrow the cross clefts, so that one
might say that society is sewn together by its inner conflicts” (Ross 1920, 165). In other words, if the dividing lines
are not somehow linked with each other, the probability is higher that there aren’t any stable groups.
10
In principle, we could replace the categorical scale for the districts with a scale measuring distance.
11
This example emphasizes that the idea of residential polarization is close to the idea of segregation.

opinion polarization. Importantly, when moving from unidimensional to multidimensional
polarization, the fact that the underlying scales may be of different measurement levels adds
complexity.
To sum up, scales that underlie a concept of multidimensional polarization may differ. Nontheless, it seems as if we can still formulate a general principle that applies to both singlescale
and multiscale polarization: Polarization is at a maximum when individuals cluster in two cells
in the respective distribution. A cell representing a value on a single scale, or a combination of
values on several scales. Moreover, when a ranking/distance is meaningful on one or several of the
underlying scales, polarization would be at a maximum when the two cells represent the endpoints
on those scales. Polarization is at a minium when all individuals cluster in a single cell.12 While it
seems possible to define states of maximum and minimum polarization it is less clear how to
treat and distributional states between those two. For instance, we may wonder how a situation
with 3 clusters (with everyone in one of 3 cells) in which two clusters occupy the endpoints,
compares to a situation in which everyone is located in one of two clusters but those clusters
do not lie at the end points.
And, importantly, if we don’t define (maximum) polarization in the abstract distributional
sense but rather in relation to a phenomenon, e.g. the distribution that leads to maximum
conflict among parties (see above), the above principle wouldn’t describe a maximally polarized
distribution.
12

For an argument, why such a distribution is not necessarily the one creating most conflicts see above.

Polarization subconcepts

By subconcepts I mean polarization concepts that specify polarization for specific social phenomena, e.g. political polarization, health polarization etc. and I already mentioned a few
above. Just as the general concept has been rarely defined (cf. DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson
1996, 692)13 , there are few definitions of corresponding subconcepts.14 For some subconcepts
several measures have been developed. Table 1 provides a quick, non-exhaustive overview of
13

See Galtung (1996) and Esteban and Ray (2012) for exceptions.
While there are few non-formal definitions one could in principle regard a mathematical formula that aggregates
values on scales in a particular way as a formal definition.
14

10

polarization subconcepts and classifies whether corresponding measures are primarily single
scale, multiscale or both. Table 1 also provides references that contain definitions or summaries
of the corresponding literatures.
I start with income polarization, as it is in this literature that one can find one of the first elaborate
and explicit discussions of the concept.15 Wolfson (1994) observed that the quite common
notion of the “disappearing middle class” is typically associated with the idea of increasing
income inequality. At the same time conventional scalar measures of inequality do not reflect
the idea that observations disappear from the middle of a distribution (cf. Levy and Murnane
1992). Consequently, Wolfson (1994, 356) suggests that “summary measures based on concepts
like polarization should be given equal space along with Lorenz-consistent inequality measures
when describing trends in income distribution” as it may be “closer to the general public’s
vernacular concept of inequality”. As income is measured on different types of scales (ordinal,
interval etc.), different measures are used for income polarization.
Ethnic polarization was coined to contrast ethnic heterogeneity long assumed to foster the
likelihood of conflict between ethnic groups (José G Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005). Ethnic
polarization is conceptualized on a single nominal scale that differentiates between ethnic
groups. Closely linked is the concept of religious polarization (Montalvo and Reynal-Querol
2002, 2003), only that the underlying scale comprises religious instead of ethnic categories.
The concept of political polarization is used to describe polarization among political actors
such as parties, party members, elected party representatives, but also among voters and the
public more generally.16 The concept is broad in its understanding and was operationalized
in different ways, i.e. using a variety of measures based on various types of scales. Layman,
Carsey, and Horowitz (2006, 87) provides an overview of conceptions/measures that have been
used to assess polarization among members of the U.S. Congress. These measures are normally
based on at least two scales, one measuring party membership (Democrat vs. Republican)
and one measuring voting behavior or opinions. In terms of the public Fiorina and Abrams
(2008) suggests that the most direct evidence of political polarization in the public are citizens’
positions on public policy issues, i.e. on opinion scales. A corresponding conceptualization
may comprise either a single or several of such scales. Again, various conceptualizations and
corresponding measures have been suggested in the literature (see Fiorina and Abrams 2008
for an overview), including conceptions that combine a nominal Party ID scale and other types
15

Importantly, I ignore measures that may have been developed in the natural sciences here.
A common finding seems that party conflict in the U.S. Congress evolves along a single dimension, a single
liberal-conservative cleavage (Layman, Carsey, and Horowitz 2006, 87)
16

of scales.17
Polarization of opinions is also termed (public) opinion polarization (Baldassarri and Gelman
2008; Munzert and Bauer 2013, Footnote 2) which simply entails looking at ‘the distribution
of political attitudes across all Americans’ (Baldassarri and Gelman 2008, 414) that is their
positions on various attitude scales.
Somewhat related is affective polarization which describes “the tendency of people identifying
as Republicans or Democrats to view opposing partisans negatively and co partisans positively”
(Iyengar and Westwood 2014, 2). Conceptualizing affective polarization thus requires data on
two scales, a Party ID scale, as well as a scale measuring feelings towards other partisans. Trait
polarization designates the difference Americans perceive between the traits of presidential
candidates (Hetherington, Long, and Rudolph 2016). This concept is also based on two scales,
a Party ID scale and a scale measuring the evaluation of traits of presidential candidates.
According to Fiorina and Abrams (2008, 563), geographic (opinion) polarization or residential
(opinion) polarization18 describes the tendency of like minded people to cluster together and live
in the same place. This concept requires a scale(s) that locates individuals geographically, e.g. in
a district as in the example above or even two scales measuring longitude and latitude and it
requires a scale measuring opinions. Naturally, individuals can be geographically polarized not
only with regard to opinions, but all sorts of social phenomena. In principle, we should further
specify on which scale individuals are geographically polarized, and we could do so by talking
about, e.g. geographic income polarization.
Intergroup polarization focuses on tracking “changes between subgroups of the population,
distinguishing people along sociodemographic lines” (Baldassarri and Gelman 2008, 414). In
other words, this concept distinguishes itself in that one of the underlying scales is sociodemographic in nature (e.g. age, income etc.). In that it is a synonym for social polarization which
refers to “the measurement of the distance between different social groups, defined on the basis
of variables such as race, religion, or ethnicity” (Fusco and Silber 2014, 841). In other words,
besides at least one scale separating individuals into different social groups, we need another
scale that measures the distance on some phenomenon, e.g. income.
Health polarization refers to the distance between individuals regarding their health. Normally,
health polarization is conceptualized on a single scale, e.g. a scale measuring self-assessed
health. But for instance, Apouey and Silber (2013) extent the concept health polarization with
a scale measuring socio-economic status that one could call socio-economic health polarization.
Permanyer and D’Ambrosio (2015) enhance the concept with a second scale measuring race,
17

Party sorting designates a stronger relation between policy positions and party ID (Fiorina and Abrams 2008,
563).
18
This idea is closely linked to the idea of geographical or residential segregation.

12

thus conceptualizing the idea of racial health polarization.
To sum up, there is a number of subconcepts coined for different social phenomena. These
differ in terms of the underlying scale types, their dimensionality (number of scales) and the
measures that have been proposed to gauge them.

Measures of polarization

Above I gave a quick overview of various polarization subconcepts. In line with those subconcepts a large number of polarization measures have been proposed in disciplines such as
Sociology, Political Science and Economics. Table 2 provides a non-exhaustive list of measures
and categorizes them. Section 6.2 in the appendix provides formulas for some of those measures.
While the conceptual ideas of polarization have been around for a long time, its empirical
measurement started much later.
Measures can be categorized along the choices I presented in Section 2 namely dimensionality, measurement level, tradition aka distributional focus and formal characterization. First,
dimensionality describes the number of scales they integrate. Unidimensional measures aggregate positions on single scales, multidimensional measures aggregate positions on at least
two scales. Second, regarding the measurement level(s) of the underlying scales. This may
be one of nominal, ordinal, interval/ratio or a particular combination thereof for multiscale
measures. Third, in terms of the distributional aspects they tap into. Esteban and Ray (2012, 3)
suggest that there are two different traditions, one could call them the “cluster tradition” and
13

the “extremeness tradition”. The first tradition focuses on capturing the presence of clusters in
uni- or multidimensional space. The second focuses on the disappearance of the ‘middle class’
(middle categories) in uni- or multidimensional space (see also Gigliarano and Mosler 2009).19
Naturally, following the ‘cluster tradition’ the question arises of how groups, i.e. clusters are
identified. In Figure 2 Plot 3b I arbitrarily marked groups (dashed black lines) as an illustration.
On the one hand we could pre-define groups, on the other hand some aggregation clustering
algorithm may find those groups in an explorative manner, e.g. by identifying groups that would
minimize within group distance and maximize between group distance.
Finally, measures can be classified according to whether they are formally characterized, i.e. derived from a formalized set of rules or not. In the next section I describe a subsample of the
measures provided in Table 2.

4.1

Measures of unidimensional Polarization

Nominal scales assign individuals to categories of concepts such as ethnicity or religious
denomination. On the individual-level we know to which category an individual belongs,
aggregation gives us the frequency across categories. Figure 2, Plot 1b illustrates a distribution
19

The second tradition goes back to Wolfson (1994). Wolfson (1994; see also Levy and Murnane 1992) starts by
suggesting that the quite common notion of the “disappearing middle class” is typically associated with the idea of
increasing income inequality. At the same time conventional scalar measures of inequality do not reflect the idea
that observations disappear from the middle of a distribution (cf. Levy and Murnane 1992).

across 6 categories (N = 400), where most observations are located in two categories in contrast
to Plot 1a. It is generally argued that a society in which individuals are evenly distributed
across categories is less polarized than a society in which individuals are concentrated in two
groups. However, when individuals are concentrated in a single group we would not speak
of polarization. Measures such as the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI) (and analog the
Ethno-Linguistic Fractionalization Index - ELF) reflect heterogeneity - that is to what extent
individuals are widely spread across categories - but ignore the aspect of bipolarity (see 6.2.2).
Reynal-Querol (2001, see also 2002) develops the so-named RQ index for nominal scales
that tries to capture how far a distribution is away from a bipolar distribution, a distribution
in which all individuals are located in two categories (see Section 6.2.10). The RQ index
can be applied to measure polarization for “nominal phenomena” (Reynal-Querol 2002).
Importantly, in using this measure we have to agree with the notion that a distribution in which
all individuals concentrate in two categories is maximally polarized.
Various measures where constructed for ordinal scales. For instance, Leik (1966) - who gives an
insightful introduction to the logic underlying ordinal scales - develops a measure of ordinal
consensus (see Section 6.2.4). Similarly, Blair and Lacy (2000) develop a measure of dispersion
for discrete data (see Section 6.2.6). Apouey (2007) develops two median-based measures
focusing on an ordinal scale of self-rated of health, i.e. self-assessed health status (SAH) (see
Section 6.2.9).20
On interval/ratio scales the magnitude of differences between the scales’ values is meaningful.
Empirical polarization research in political science and sociology that focuses on single scales
mostly relies on classic summaries of distributions such as the variance or the kurtosis, that
reflect the idea of dispersion or bi-modality (see Section 6.2.1). DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson
(1996) give an overview of conceptualizations and corresponding measures up until 1996. For
instance, Down and Wilson (2010, 69) use the variance as a measure of polarization in their
study on opinion polarization and inter-party competition.
In 1994 Esteban and Ray (1994) formally derive a measure of polarization for discrete
scales/distributions - the so-named ER index (see Section 6.2.5) .21 While the measure can
easly be mistaken as a unidimensional measure it requires exogenously defining groups using
20

Measures of inequality “are mean based. Thus, cardinality must be imposed on ordinal SAH categories in
order to calculate a mean, which can then be used to compute an inequality measure such as the Gini coefficient.
This approach is interesting (especially when dealing with reporting bias), but it has a shortcoming: imposing
cardinality is a supra-ordinal assumption that changes the original properties of the SAH” (Apouey 2007, 875).
“Apouey’s polarization measure is an extension of traditional income bi-polarization measures, and, as such, does
not include information on any salient social characteristics in the analysis” (Permanyer and D’Ambrosio 2015,
313).
21
According to the authors polarization measurement starts with Esteban and Ray (1991), Esteban, Gradin and
Ray (1998,2007) and Duclos, Esteban and Ray (2004)" (Esteban and Ray 2012)

a second scale. In 2004 Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004, 1739) follow up on their previous
work and provide a polarization measurement theory that is relevant to describe cases in
which distributions can be described by density functions.22 Naturally, at some point the focus
shifted to multidimensional polarization - not only theoretically but also in terms of empirical
measurement. We’ll shortly discuss some multidimensional measures below.

4.2

Measures of multidimensional Polarization

In principle there are situations in which polarization along a single scale may matter. If it is
extreme enough, e.g. think of extreme income or wealth polarization, any other differences between group members may loose their significance and it may lead to conflicts. Often, however,
polarization seems to matter more when it is multidimensional in nature. Classic notions of
polarization (e.g. Ross 1920 etc.) tend to link at least two scales with each other, for instance
class/wealth or religion/wealth and corresponding measures of multidimensional polarization
aggregate positions on at least two scales. Different authors have developed measures that
aggregate positions on several scales with the same or differing measurement levels.
The nominal-ordinal 2-dimensional combination is covered by different measures. Permanyer
and D’Ambrosio (2015) axiomatically characterize measures that combine a nominal scale with
an ordinal scale. As an example they use the nominal scale race (black vs. white) and the
ordinal scale self-assessed health (very poor, poor, fair, good, to very good). In other words,
they define a social polarization index that incorporates the fact that a society is partitioned
into groups on the basis of salient social characteristics (e.g. race or ethnicity) and that these
groups may be clustered in certain areas of another scale’s distribution, e.g. have mostly low
values of self-assessed health. Their measure can also be used for a combination of nominal
scales (see Section 6.2.16).
Likewise, Fusco and Silber (2014, 850) propose a number of measures that allow for measuring
multidimensional polarization combining a nominal and an ordinal scale. In their example
they combine self-assessed health (Very good, good, fair, bad, to very bad) and citizenship (yes
vs. no). Thereby, the authors borrow indices from the literature on segregation and equality of
opportunity and distinguish between a segmentation/stratification approach and an antipodal
22

Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004, 1739) emphasize a problem with their original measure (ER index): It is
“based on a discrete, finite set of income groupings located in a cardinal ambient space of possible income values”.
Conceptually this is problematic since the measure presents an “unpleasant discontinuity” because of its foundation
in a population distributed over a discrete/distinct number of points. Practically, it assumed that the population
has already been sorted into the relevant groups, an exogenous process. Recommendations on how to do that
practically are given in Esteban, Gradín, and Ray (2007). But for aggregated sample data (along income intervals)
it is unclear what kind of differences across time/entities represent significant ones.

16

approach. The former focuses on the overlap of ordinal variables between population subgroups.
The latter departs from the idea that polarization is maximal when individuals of a nominal
subgroup are all in the same - either the lowest or highest - ordinal category (Fusco and Silber
2014, 841) (see Section 6.2.17).
Further measures combine nominal-interval/ratio scales. Permanyer (2012) provides an example
with data from the World Values Survey in which religious affiliation is the nominal scale and
religiosity the interval scale, that is used to construct a distance measure (see 6.2.14). Permanyer
(2012) builds on the RQ index criticizing that it’s not formally characterized, i.e. derived from a
clear set of axioms and that it fails to capture any variation of the level of alienation that exists
between groups (which represents the second dimension). For instance, certain religious groups
may be more distant from others, e.g. the distance maybe smaller within Christian and Islamic
denominations than across those groups. In other words, it’s only defined on the basis of the
population-weights that these groups represent.23 Consequently, Permanyer (2012) suggests to
add distance as a second dimension. Permanyer (2012) provides two indices that may be used
for a combination of a nominal and an interval scale that are generalizations of the RQ index
and incorporate an element of alienation (distance) within and between groups.
Anderson, Linton, and Leo (2012) focus on polarization among countries in terms of GDP per
capital (life-time over time). The authors develop two statistics - the Overlap measure and
the Trapezoidal measure - that can discern changes in the underlying distributions of groups
(e.g. groups of countries). These statistics reflect combinations of increasing (decreasing)
subgroup location differences and decreasing (increasing) subgroup spreads, which are the
characteristics of polarization (de-polarization) in many dimensions (Anderson, Linton, and Leo
2012, 53). Concretely, the authors use their measure to gauge polarization between countries
grouped according to time (1990, 1995, 200, 2005) and continent (Africa vs. The Rest).24
Gigliarano and Mosler (2009) construct multivariate indices of polarization. They consider
polarization as the presence of groups which are internally homogeneous, externally heterogeneous, and of similar size. In that Gigliarano and Mosler (2009) follow the second strand
in the polarization measurement literature which focuses on identifying groups rather than
disappearance of the middle categories. Gigliarano and Mosler (2009, 437) propose polarization
indices that are functions of the inequality between groups, the inequality within groups, and
the relative groups size. Thereby, the authors present measures of these three elements that are
subsequently combined in an index. Gigliarano and Mosler (2009) apply those indices to data
23

Permanyer and D’Ambrosio (2015, 312)
When the “sub-distributions are not separately identified (by which is meant that the constituents of each
group cannot be distinguished or separated from each other) but are embedded in a mixture, the Overlap measure
is no longer useful, while fortunately the Trapezoid measure is, provided the mixture is bimodal” (Anderson,
Linton, and Leo 2012, 54).

from German socio-economic panel that concerns the bi-variate distribution between income
and education.
Another, increasingly used measure departs from the conceptual idea of alignment across scales
(e.g. Converse 1964; Coser 1956; Galtung 1966). “[I]f people align along multiple, potentially
divisive issues [scales], even if they do not take extreme positions on single issues [scales], the
end result is a polarized society” (Baldassarri and Gelman 2008, 409). One of the measures
proposed here is the average pair-wise correlation across scales (e.g. used in Baldassarri and
Gelman 2008; Munzert and Bauer 2013).25 Using this measure Baldassarri and Gelman (2008,
419) suggest that ‘as the correlation between ideological dimensions [scales] increases, the
distance between individuals that belong to the same cluster decreases, while the distance
between people that belong to alternative clusters increases’. In principle the average-pair wise
correlation should then account for both the aspect of dispersion and clustering in a multidimensional distribution.
To conclude, there are various polarization measures that have been developed to measure unior multidimensional polarization on different scale types. Often authors provide an example
and apply their measures to phenomena such as self-assessed health, income or opinions. Thus,
in principle interested researchers can choose from a wide variety of measures and apply them
to their data. At the same time few of those measures are easily available for researchers to use
and compare them.

Conclusion

In this study we pursue the question How can we conceptualize/measure polarization? Thereby, I
surveyed contributions from the fields of Economics, Political Science and Sociology.
The concept of polarization - due to its general nature - has appeared as early as in the 1920s in
the work of Ross. Thereafter, it turns up more or less explicitly in the works of other influential
scholars such as Deutsch, Blau, Galtung or Marx. Nonetheless, one rarely finds explicit attempts
to define the concept (e.g. Galtung 1996; Esteban and Ray 2012). In principle, however, any
formula that aggregates positions on one or more scales and is used as a polarization measure
can be regarded as an implicit definition of the concept. Such a formula fixes the number
of scales that are used as input and the rules of how values on those scales are aggregated.

While scholars discussed the multidimensional nature of the polarization concept early on, the
measurement literature started with single scales aka unidimensional polarization.
I started by outlining that conceptualizing and measuring polarization requires choices regarding
how many and which kind of scales to incorporate as well as what distributional characteristics
to focus on. Naturally, such choices depend on the phenomenon we are studying and one would
probably make different choices when studying, for instance, income polarization as opposed
to opinion polarization. Accordingly, there is no one-fits-all measure but scholars need choose
or develop a measure that is aligned with their conceptual choices. A review of polarization
subconcepts emphasizes that the concept is widely applied and that - in applied research scholars tend to conceptualize/measure polarization differently depending on which kind of
phenomenon they study.
The very short (non-exhaustive) overview of measures of polarization reveals a wide variety of
measures that can be classified along the choices we outlined before. One of the more important
distinctions is whether they are formally derived (based on a set of axioms) or not. From
the three disciplines that we inspected more closely here, it seems as if most developments
happen within economics, where scholars moved from developing unidimensional measures to
multidimensional measures for particular scale combinations. Comparably less development is
happening within Sociology and Political Science. In general, it is my impression that scholars
are not yet aware of the diversity that exists within the measurement literature. For instance,
political scientists seem to have hardly taken note of the developments in economics or at least
do not use the corresponding measures developed by economists.
It appears that there are several venues for future research. First, the polarization literature
seems to lack a comprehensive methodological assessment and comparison of different polarization measures. Simulation studies that compare different measures are hard to come by.
This can probably be explained by the fact that empirical research on polarization is still a
relatively young field (as compared to others) and by the fact that data simulation is technically
challenging (especially if we want to flexibly produce multidimensional clustered data).
Moreover, the relevance of the polarization concept is often deduced from its relation to concflict
and/or non-cooperation. My impression is that this link is a bit undertheorized and may change
as a consequence of the phenomenon we study. Think of a scale of ethnic categories. As we
mentioned one can make a sound argument that either a distribution with two equally sized
ethnic groups leads to most conflicts or a distribution with one group dominating one or several
smaller ones. Hence, insofar we see resulting conflict as something that constitutes polarization
we may have to rethink our polarization concept and the corresponding measure.
Another aspect that we found is underemphasized in the polarization literature is group size.

19

One can argue that polarization is a matter of groups so that the contribution of isolated individuals should be negligible (Esteban and Ray 2012, 3). However, in everyday life we often live
and interact within small groups, where the role of one or two “isolated” individuals is much
more important. Any student that has lived in a shared flat can sing a song about such situations.
In my view, group size should be an important aspect in any discussion of polarization. This
currently does not seem too be the case.
Finally, it was previously suggested that “[i]n contrast to judging levels of polarization, identifying trends in polarization is an easier task” (Fiorina and Abrams 2008, 567). To me it seems as
if both judgments are equally difficult. In themselves, polarization measures are often hard to
interpret. For instance, we may use the variance as a polarization measure and find a difference
of X between two groups or between two time points. However, insofar our polarization scale
does not have a clear interpretation26 in itself we need to anchor our scale using empirical
cases. For instance, a study of polarization trends in the U.S. becomes more meaningful when
we can compare U.S. trends to trends from other countries (cf. Munzert and Bauer 2013). This
anchoring process and generally the interpretation of differences on polarization scales requires
more scholarly attention.

26

One way would be if we can express changes on our aggregate scale in terms of individual-level changes, i.e. if
we would argue that a change of 1 in the variance can be more or less equalled with 100 individuals moving 1
unit further away from the distribution’s mean.

Software
Measures of polarization

Various R software packages can be used to calculate measures of polarization. The package

agrmt (Ruedin 2016) contains functions to calculate agreement or consensus in ordered rating
scales. The package acid (Sohn 2016) contains the functions polarisation.ER (Esteban &
Ray 1994) and polarisation.EGR (Esteban, Gradin and Ray 2007) to calculate the respective
polarization indices. The package ineq (Zeileis and Kleiber 2014) contains a set of inequality
measures. The Herfindahl index can be computed relying on various packages, e.g. the hhi
function in the hhi package (Waggoner 2018).
6.1.2

Data simulation

Simulating undimensional clustered data is fairly easy. The challenge lies in simulating both
unidimensional and multidimensional data that has certain characteristics not only in terms of
variance (the idea of extremeness as polarization) but also in terms of clustering. Various R
package contain functions to simulate (clustered) data for varying dimensions. The package

clusterSim contains the function cluster.Gen to generate random clusters “with known
structure of clusters (optionally with noisy variables and outliers) (Walesiak and Dudek 2017).
The package GenOrd contains the function ordsample to”Simulation of Discrete Random
Variables with Given Correlation Matrix and Marginal Distributions" (Barbiero and Ferrari
2015). The package MixSim was programmed for simulation of “Data to Study Performance of
Clustering Algorithms” (Melnykov, Chen, and Maitra 2017). The package clusterGeneration
contains the genRandomClust function to “[g]enerate cluster data sets with specified degree
of separation” (Qiu and Joe 2015). Besides R one can also simulate clustered data relying on
Python (Source) (Mingle 2018)

Overview of some polarisation measures

Several articles provide helpful summarizes of polarization measures (e.g. Zhang and Kanbur
2001). Below we provide a non-exhaustive overview.

21

6.2.1

Variance and Kurtosis

Variance and kurtosis are among the simplest of polarization measures and often used to
measure the concept on single scales.
The variance (sample):
n

1X
2
v(x) =
(x i − x)
n i=1
The kurtosis (Wikipedia contributors 2017b):
K URT (x) =

µ4
E[(X − µ)4 ]
=
,
σ4
(E[(X − µ)2 ])2

where µ4 is the fourth central moment and σ is the standard deviation. The kurtosis can
be calculated relying, e.g. relying on the kurtosis function in the moments package (Lukasz
Komsta 2015). The variance can be calculated using the var function in the stats package
The use of both measures to gauge polarization has been criticized (see e.g. Downey and
Huffman 2001)

6.2.2

Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization Index (ELF) and HHI

The ethnolinguistic fractionalization index (Alesina et al. 2003) is normally calculated as 1 Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) (cf. Hirschman 1964, 1980; Herfindahl 1950):

E LF j = 1 −

N
X

si2j

i=1

, where si j is the share of group i (i = 1. . . N) in country j.
Conceptually, the ELF gives the probability that two randomly selected individuals drawn from
a given population will not belong to the same group. Analogue the HHI gives the probability
that two individuals drawn from a given population will belong to the same group.
The Herfindahl index can be computed relying on various packages, e.g. the hhi function in the

hhi package (Waggoner 2018).

22

6.2.3

Gini coefficient

The Gini coefficient (Gini 1921, @Gini1912–bg) is the most used measure of inequality and a
measure of statistical dispersion. While not a measure of polarization itself it is strongly related
measures such as by Esteban and Ray (1994). There are various formulas to calculate the Gini
and it is usually defined mathematically based on the Lorenz curve. Another way is to “consider
the Gini coefficient as half of the relative mean absolute difference, which is a mathematical
equivalence.[. . . ] The mean absolute difference is the average absolute difference of all pairs
of items of the population, and the relative mean absolute difference is the mean absolute
difference divided by the average, to normalize for scale.” (Wikipedia contributors 2017a; Sen
1973 or 1977 second edition):
n X
n
X

G=

xi − x j

i=1 j=1

2

n X

i=1 j=1

However, by neglecting (giving equal weight to) “the population frequency in each category,
inequality measurement departs from the study of differentiation [polarization]” (Esteban
and Ray 1994, 821). From a latter perspective “the formation of categories or groups, or
‘subsocieties,’ the population frequency in each category also [should also carry] carries weight”
(Esteban and Ray 1994, 821). However, “the axioms of inequality measurement (or equivalently,
second-order stochastic dominance for mean- normalized distributions) fail to adequately
distinguish between”convergence" to the global mean and “clustering” around “local means.”
(Esteban and Ray 1994, 821)

6.2.4

Leik 1966

Leik (1966, 86) suggests a measure of ordinal dispersion that is defined as follows:
Pi
D=

M AX

d
i=1 i
Pi
i=1

di

23

=

2

Pi
i=1

di

m−1

where m is the number of categories of the ordinal scale. di is a difference that is defined as
(
di =

Fi if Fi ≤ 0.50
1 − Fi otherwise

where Fi is the relative frequency distribution. D is “free of sample size, number of choice
options, central tendency, and assumptions about intervals between choice options; yet it
accurately reflects the degree to which choices are spread over the set of options available.
Furthermore, because the measure is a sum divided by its maximum possible value, D is a
percentage, hence a ratio scale variable” (Leik 1966, 86).
Leik (1966, 87) suggests that a simple measure of ordinal consensus would be D − 1. Relatedly,
a measure of interval consensus is:
2σ
Interval Consensus = 1 −
m−1


2

Leik (1966) contrasts the two measures and suggests that “Ordinal Consensus appears to be
preferable as a measure of consensus to one based on variance” (Leik 1966, 88).27
See functionLeik in package agrmt (Ruedin 2016).
6.2.5

Esteban and Ray (1994): ER Index

Esteban and Ray (1994) formally derive a polarization measure for discrete distributions.28
The formula is below:

P(π, y) =

n X
n
X

πi π j T(I(πi ), a(δ( yi , y j )))

i=1 j=1

Conceptually, P depends on identification I which is a function of individual i’s group size πi .
Identification reflects the idea that an individual feels a sense of identification with others in
the group, a sense that increases with the number of individuals in this group (reflected by πi ).
P also depends on alienation a(δ( yi , y j )) where δ( yi , y j ) simply describes the absolute distance
between two individuals i and j. The effective antagonism is given by a cardinal function T (I, a)
27

Leik (1966, 88) also points to the problem of statistical significance as without “assumptions about the intervals,
allowing algebraic derivation of, e.g., a moment generating function, there seems to be no way to derive sampling
variability of the index”.
28
“According to the authors polarization measurement starts with Esteban and Ray (1991), Esteban, Gradin and
Ray (1998,2007) and Duclos, Esteban and Ray (2004)” (Esteban and Ray 2012)

24

that combines both identification and alienation. The choice of I(˙), a(˙) and T(˙) will yield a
particular measure of polarization:

P (π, y) = K
∗

n X
n
X

π1+α
π j | yi − y j |
i

i=1 j=1

where K is a multiplicative constant that is used for normalization, and α restricts identification
function to the form pα where α > 0. As α goes to zero P approximates the Gini coefficient
(defined on log incomes). π is a vector of shares and y is a vector of means. yi and y j are
the means in the respective groups and πi and π j are the proportions of observations in those
groups.

6.2.6

Blair and Lacy 2000: d2

d 2 is a measure of dispersion for discrete data:
k−1
X
d =
(Fi − 1/2)2

i=1

where Fi is the cumulative frequency for the ith category; that is Fi =

Pi
j=1

p j with p j represent-

ing the sample proportion for the jth of the k categories (Blair and Lacy 2000, 255–56).

6.2.7

Wolfson 1994: W Index

Wolfson (1994) departs from the observation that the quite common notion of the “disappearing
middle class” is typically associated with the idea of increasing income inequality. At the
same time conventional scalar measures of inequality do not reflect the idea that observations
disappear from the middle of a distribution (cf. Levy and Murnane 1992). Consequently,
Wolfson (1994, 356) suggests that “summary measures based on concepts like polarization
should be given equal space along with Lorenz-consistent inequality measures when describing
trends in income distribution” as it may be “closer to the general public’s vernacular concept of
inequality”.
The index by Wolfson (1994) is derived from the Lorenz curve and may be written as follows
(see Zhang and Kanbur 2001, 89):
W = 2(2T − Gini)/(m/ ∝) = 2(∝∗ − ∝ L )/m
25

where T = 0.5− L(0.5) and L(0.5) denotes the income share of the bottom half of the population;
m is the median income; ∝ is the mean income; ∝∗ is the distribution-corrected mean income
which is given by the actual mean times (1-Gini); and ∝ L is the mean income of the bottom
half of the population.The maximum polarization occurs when half the population has zero
income and the other half has twice the mean (see also Wolfson 1997, and @Foster2010–zx).
Software wise the index can be computed relying on the polar.aff in the affluenceIndex
package (Alicja Wolny-Dominiak 2017).

6.2.8

Wang Tsui 2000: WT Index

Wang and Tsui (2000) generalize a new class of indices (TW index hereafter) based on the
Wolfson index using the two partial ordering axioms of increased bipolarity and increased
spread. The formula is (see Zhang and Kanbur 2001, 89):
K
yi − m
θ X
TW =
πi
N i=1
m

r

where N is the number of total population, πi is the number of population in-group i, K is the
number of groups, yi is the mean value in group i, and m is the median income. θ is a positive
constant scalar and r ∈ (0, 1). Zhang and Kanbur (2001, 89) set r to 0.5.
6.2.9

Apouey 2007

Apouey (2007) suggest two polarization indices for ordinal scales. On ordinal scales all the information is given “given either by the distribution of cumulative numbers N = (N1 , ..., NC−1 , NC )
or by that of cumulative proportions F = (F1 , ..., FC−1 , 1), two indices of polarization are conceivable: one is a function of N ; , P1 (N ), and the other one is a function of F, P1 (F ).” (Apouey
2007, 881). The formulas are as follows:

Reynal-Querol 2001/2002: RQ Index

The polarization index by Reynal-Querol (Reynal-Querol 2001, 2002; Jose G Montalvo and
Reynal-Querol 2005) is a measure of polarization for nominal scales. The RQ can be written as
(cf. Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2010, 127):

RQ = 1 −


N 
X
0.5 − π 2
i

0.5

i=1

πi

, where πi is the proportion of individuals in each (ethnic) group and N is the number of
(ethnic) groups. The RQ can also be written as
IRC1 =

N
X

f (πi )

i=1

and thus critically depends on the properties of f which reaches a minimum for π = 1/6 and a
maximum for π = 1/2 and is convex for π < 1/3 and concave for π < 1/3 concave for π > 1/3
(see Figure 1). Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2010, 128) discuss differences of the RQ index to
measures such as the ELF and the ER.

Duclos, Esteban and Ray (2004): DER Index

Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004) formally derive a measure that can be used for cases in which
a (income) distribution can be described by density functions.
The measure is the following:
Pa ( f ) =

f (x)1+α f ( y)| y − x|d y d x

Eiik 2001: Agreement on ordered rating scale

Van Der Eijk (2001) proposes a measure of agreement for ordered rating scales.


(S − 1)
A= U · 1−
(K − 1)
where S is the number of non-empty categories, and K is the total number of categories in the
rating scale.

27

“As the original empirical distribution is decomposed into layers, the degree of its agreement
can be described as the weighted average of the agreement in each of its constituent layers
(from here on to be distinguished by an index i), where the proportions of cases contained in
the layers are used as weights”:
A=

The function agreement in the package agrmt (Ruedin 2016) contains functions to calculate
agreement or consensus in ordered rating scales.

Party system polarization by Dalton (2008, 906). Underlying data is the average perceived
party position (average across all individuals in a country) on the left-right scale and the party
vote share.

Permaneyer 2012

Permanyer (2012) introduces two measures that are somewhat related to the RQ index.

PNb ,a ( f

)=

N X
X

π1+α
π j (µi + µ j )
i

i=1 j6=i

where α ∈ (0, 1] and µi is the mean value of the radicalism distribution f i (x). Here alienation is a
PN P
between group phenomenon only. Moreover, when α = 0 then PNb ,a ( f ) = i=1 j6=i πi π j (µi +µ j )
which can be regarded as some sort of weighted fractionalization index (Permanyer 2012, 53).
Permanyer (2012, 58) also introduces an index that accounts for within group distances.
PN ,a ( f ) =

where α ∈ [ 3N1−2 , 1].
6.2.15

Apouey and Silber 2013

Apouey and Silber (2013) develop measures of polarization on two ordinal scales (e.g. health
and socio-economic status). There approach generalizes previous uni-variate approaches (Abul
Naga and Yalcin 2008; Apouey 2007; Reardon 2009). The formula is as follows:

B1 = 1 −

 PH PY

2 h=1 y=1 |Fh, y − 0.5| − 1
HY − 1

where Fh, y are the elements of the observed cumulative probabilities from which the elements
of a maximal bi-polarized matrix (= 0.5) are subtracted. H are the indices of the categories of
the first variable, Y of the second variable.
They also consider a second measure that is:
H

B2 =

Y

XX
1
4Fh, y (1 − Fh, y )
H Y − 1 h=1 y=1

which is an extension of (Reardon 2009).

6.2.16

Permanyer and D’Ambrosio 2015

Permanyer and D’Ambrosio (2015) also develop a measure of polarization on a nominal and an
ordinal scale (cf. Fusco and Silber 2014, 847). The formula is as follows:

AP =

I X
I
X

Si1+α Sh (1 − θih )

i=1 h=1

where α = 0.71 and θih =

PK
j=1

M in(pi j ph j ) where the subscripts i and h refer to unordered

population subgroups, I being the total number of such groups and j to the various health
categories, J being the total number of such categories (Permanyer and D’Ambrosio 2015).

6.2.17

Fusco and Silber 2014

Fusco and Silber (2014) propose two measures of multidimensional social polarization. The
concrete example they use is self-assessed health (SAH) - first dimension - among immigrants
29

and non-immigrants - second dimension. The first focuses on the overlap of the distributions of
different subgroups (segmentation or stratification approach). The second approach lays the
emphasis on bi-polarization and “considers that the social polarization of SAH will be maximal
if the individuals belonging to a given population subgroup are in the same health category but
this category corresponds either to the lowest or to the highest health status” (Fusco and Silber
2014, 842). The series of indices is shown below:

The concepts of cleavage and polarization

The concept of “cleavage” can be regarded as a conceptual relative of “polarization” and research
relevant to the idea of polarization still often carries the label “cleavage” today. The cleavage
concept seems to go back to Lipset and Rokkan (1967) who investigated “when the one type of
cleavage will prove more salient than the other, what kind of alliances they have produced and
what consequences these constellations of forces have had for consensus-building within the
nation-state” (Lipset and Rokkan 1967, 6). Lipset and Rokkan (1967) use the term “cleavage”
to refer to “conflict groups based on perceptions of association in opposition to other such
groupings among large segments of a population” (Zuckerman 1975, 234). In their conception

30

cleavages develop in the social realm and are politicized when they develop into large scale
conflicts and become tied to political parties (Zuckerman 1975, 234). In their seminal work
Lipset and Rokkan (1967, 35) differentiate between four cleavages: center-periphery, statechurch, land-industry and owner-worker and explain the contrasts between Western party
systems by national historical developments of these cleavages. According to the authors,
especially the first three are responsible for national developments in divergent directions.29
Independently from this key study, the concept of “cleavage” has remained vague and ambiguous
in the contemporary literature (Zuckerman 1982, 1975). Scholars reacted to this ambiguity
by extending the concept through qualifications such as political, cultural, institutionalized or
non-institutionalized cleavages - a development that withdrew considerable theoretical value
from the concept itself (Bartolini and Mair 2007, 198). To reverse this trend, Bartolini and
Mair (2007) make another attempt in defining the concept. According to the authors, the
concept of “cleavage” incorporates three levels: “[A]n empirical element, which identifies the
empirical referent of the concept, and which we can define in socio-structural terms; a normative
element, that is the set of values and beliefs which provides a sense of identity and role to the
empirical element, and which reflect the self-consciousness of the social group(s) involved; and
an organisational/behavioral element, that is the set of individual interactions, institutions, and
organisations, such as political parties, which develop as part of the cleavage” (Bartolini and
Mair 2007, 199). Subsequently, the term “cleavage” should be restricted to the “indication of
a dividing line in a polity which refers to and combines all three aspects” (Bartolini and Mair
2007, 200).
Some scholars relieve the “cleavage” concept from its strong tie to social structural variables (in
contrast to Bartolini and Mair 2007, 198). For instance, Dahl (1966, 48ff) defines it in terms
of differences in political attitudes and behavior (cf. Zuckerman 1975, 235). Similarly, Rae
and Taylor (1970, 1, 23) conceive “cleavage” as “the criteria which divide the members of a
community or sub-community into groups with important political differences at specific times
and places” and differentiate between trait cleavages such as race or caste, attitudinal cleavages
such as ideology or preference and behavioral cleavages such as those elicited through voting or
organizational membership (Rae and Taylor 1970, 1).
When we restrict the concept of “cleavage” to attitudes as (partly) does Dahl (1966) and Rae and
29

Moreover, the authors established the famous “freezing hypothesis” stating that the “the party systems of
the 1960’s reflect, with few but significant exceptions, the cleavage structures of the 1920’s” (Lipset and Rokkan
1967, 50). They argue that the basic differences between party systems go back to the early phases of competitive
politics and emerged before the final phase of mass mobilization. This is also the reason why the fourth cleavage
(owner-worker) proved to be of less relevance (Lipset and Rokkan 1967, 35). Methodologically, the authors base
these insights on a systematic overview of the comparative history of partisan oppositions in European polities up
to the 1920s.

31

Taylor (1970) with the term “attitudinal cleavage” we are essentially speaking about divisions in
public opinion. However, even in this latter understanding, cleavage is a dichotomous concept
with individuals of a society located on either side of the division line, the “cleavage”. More
generally, the cleavage concept with its deadlocked dimensions of owners vs. workers, church
vs. state, urban vs. rural and center vs. periphery looks slightly outdated with regard to the
increasingly difficulty to divide publics into these categories.
