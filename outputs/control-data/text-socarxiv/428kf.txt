Abstract
This study diachronically investigates the trend of the “open access” in the Web of Science (WoS) category of “communication.”
To evaluate the trend, data were collected from 184 categories of WoS from 1980 to 2017. A total of 87,997,893 documents
were obtained, of which 95,304 (0.10%) were in the category of “communication.” In average, 4.24% of the documents in
all 184 categories were open access. While in communication, it was 3.29%, which ranked communication 116 out of 184.
An Open Access Index (OAI) was developed to predict the trend of open access in communication. Based on the OAI,
communication needs 77 years to fully reach open access, which undeniably can be considered as “crisis in scientific publishing”
in this field. Given this stunning information, it is the time for a global call for “open access” by communication scholars
across the world. Future research should investigate whether the current business models of publications in communication
scholarships are encouraging open access or pose unnecessary restrictions on knowledge development.

Introduction
From the beginning of this century, the traditional model of
science communication has undergone profound changes,
especially after Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) in
January 2002. The BOAI, often seen as the origin of the
Open Access (OA) movement (Wenzler, 2017), set out the
principles, strategies, rules, and commitments related to OA
to research literature (Miguel, de Oliveira, & Gracio, 2016).
Some scholars believe that the BOAI and other similar initiatives, such as Berlin (Max Planck Institute for the History of
Science, 2003) and Bethesda (Earlham College, 2003), were
a result of “crisis in scientific publishing.” Such a crisis
occurs as a consequence of high prices for subscriptions,
reduction of libraries’ budgets, and other restrictions on
access to scientific publications for the scientific community
(Miguel et al., 2016).
Recently produced science and knowledge should be
accessible to all citizens equally, particularly when considering “Free Access” at the core of OA movement and related
initiatives. In fact, OA publications should pose no barrier to
a reader other than having access to the Internet (Forrester,

2015). OA does not mean just being free to download.
According to Sahu (2005), OA means free availability on the
public Internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy,
distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software,
or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial,
legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from
gaining access to the Internet itself. The only acceptable conditions that should be considered within the framework of
OA is giving authors both control over the integrity of their

(Miguel et al., 2016).
Since 2002, the OA movement, especially with the introduction of gold, green, and hybrid roads (Rizor & Holley,
2014), has become a new trend in scholarly outputs. Some
journals in different fields of study started shifting toward
seeing OA as an advantage; nevertheless, the volume of OA
documents available is still low. Many journals are displeased with this movement, to the extent that the percentage
of OA documents in journals included in the Web of Science
(WoS) and Scopus is barely 23% on the two gold and green
roads (Björk, Laakso, Welling, & Paetau, 2014).
This study is dedicated to, first, find the volume of “open
access” documents in the WoS categories in general and, second, investigate the directions and trends of OA within the
study field of “communication.” “Communication” was
selected as the specific category due to its rich and old history of intensive debates on the issue of “Open and Free
Access,” which by default put “communication” scientific
productions as top priority that “Must and Should” be OA.

The Debate Over “Free Access”
in Communication
The recent movement for OA and other related initiatives are
not completely new in communication scholarship. The two
basic issues of “free flow of information” and “free access to
information and knowledge” have been discussion topics for
many decades in “communication,” and repetitiously emphasized in several universal constitutions, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Right and United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s
(UNESCO) related documents (Ghanbari Baghestan &
Hassan, 2009). In this regard, three major phases can be
highlighted, wherein all the issues of “free access to information and knowledge” are at the core.
First, the “free flow of information” was the subject of
intense debates at both national and international forums
beginning in the early 1940s. In 1948, the United Nation
General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of
Human Right, of which Article 19 explicitly recognized free
expression as a fundamental human right. This right, among
others, includes the freedom to hold opinion without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas
through any media regardless of frontiers (Cate, 1989). As it
is also highlighted in First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, this Article not only recognizes the free flow of
information, but goes further to guarantee reception of the
information. The meaning of this extension is very significant to communication as a field (Cate, 1989). Second, in the
early 1960s, UNESCO becomes the forum for debate on this
issue. The MacBride Commission is one of the groups
assigned the awesome task of studying the totality of this
issue in modern societies (Raube-Wilson, 1986). It is worth
highlighting that the McBride report addresses multiple

SAGE Open
matters, among them “democratization of communication,”
insisting on removal of all communication obstacles.
Although, due to consequence of the free flow of information, the world was divided both along an East-West and
North-South axis, UNESCO managed to take initiatives that
continue to characterize it today. Third, with the rise of
Internet in the later decades of the last century, the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) passed a resolution in 1998 proposing the idea of a World Summit on
Information Society (WSIS), under the auspice of the United
Nations. The WSIS was held in Geneva in 2003 (first phase)
and in Tunis in 2005 (second phase), and presented the
Geneva Declaration of Principles (ITU, 2003a), Geneva Plan
of Action (ITU, 2003b), the Tunis Commitment (ITU,
2005b), and the Tunis Agenda (ITU, 2005a) for governance
of the Internet and the flow of information and knowledge,
respectively. The Geneva Declaration of Principles in 2003
is one of the major outcomes of the WSIS summit merit, with
special attention on the provision of access to information
and knowledge for the whole population (Weber, 2010).
Considering the above background and history, it was
highly expected that “communication,” as a field and because
of its nature, will lead the OA movement and related initiatives, particularly in the world of scientific productions.
However, after more than eight decades of intense debates
regarding “Free Access,” five decades indexing scientific
journals (Garfield, 1964), and 15 years of OA Movement, it
is of importance to evaluate the volume of OA in “communication” itself to find whether there is a “crisis” in access to
the scientific publications (Miguel et al., 2016) in this field.
In other words, in the context of realizing greater OA to communication scholarly literatures, how much progress has
been achieved in the field of communication scholarship? Is
it acceptable or not?

Method
To evaluate the trends and directions of free accessibility to
the scientific productions in communication, a bibliometric
study was conducted. Bibliometric is defined as “a set of
methods to quantitatively analyse academic literature and
scholarly communications” (Das, 2015). There are multiple
papers that have used bibliometrics in the fields of social science (Farahmand, Mariani, Ghanbari Baghestan, Ebrahim, &
Matinnia, 2018; Ingwersen, 2000; Kalantari et al., 2017;
Riazi et al., 2019) and communication (Gonzalez & Guarinos,
2017) to measure scientific progress. Bibliometrics is an
essential aspect of measuring academic and organization
performance based on various indices, including the number
of publications, number of citations, and average citations
per year (Davidson et al., 2014; Farahmand et al., 2018;
Etemadifard, Khaniki, Ghanbari Baghestan, & Mehrnoosh,
2018). Web-based citation databases like Scopus and the
WoS are frequently used for deriving bibliometric data (Das,
2015). The WoS is the most appropriate powerful, large, and

trustworthy database for literature retrieval and analysis
(Aghaei Chadegani et al., 2013; Gal, Glanzel, & Sipido,
2017; Meho & Rogers, 2008).
Data were collected from the WoS Core Collection based
on a category search of “communication” on December 1,
2017. The WoS was selected for two main reasons. First, it
has more precise coverage in the category of communication, and second, it covers the top prestigious journals highly
expected to be OA. The WoS Core Collection consists of six
databases—Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIExpanded), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), Art &
Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI), Conference Proceeding
Citation Index Science (CPCI-S), Conference Proceeding
Citation Index Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),
and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI). The WoS
included conference proceedings from 2004 and ESCI from
2015 in their databases. The time span was 1980 to the data
collection date.
To evaluate the rank of communication category documents within all existed categories in the WoS Core
Collection, the number of total published documents and the
portion of OA documents were extracted for all 184 categories of the WoS Core Collection. The data search was
repeated for each year from 1980 to 2017. The total publications and OA availability were checked and recorded in a
Microsoft Excel sheet for each year separately. To assess the
differences between OA and non-OA, publications were
sorted in terms of type of documents, country, and languages
of all collected data, and were integrated in a dataset. The
country, document type, and language of the all documents
were collected yearly from 2007 (the year in which first
series of OA documents were available in the category of
communication) till 2017. Frequency analysis and chi-square
tests were used to find any correlation between the country,
document type, language, and OA trends. Finally, an equation was developed to predict the trend of OA in communication (called OAI).

Results and Discussion
Of the 87,997,893 documents which were obtained from all
184 categories of the WoS Core collection, 84,274,416
(95.76%) were non-OA and 3,723,504 (4.24%) were OA.
Out of the total number of documents analyzed, 95,304
(0.10%) documents were in the communication category,
and surprisingly, only 3,142 (3.29%) of them were indexed
as OA documents, which is 0.95% less than the average
among others. These figures ranked communication at 142
and 116 of 184 in scientific productions and in OA,
respectively.

OA Trend in Communication
According to the results, before 2006, there were no OA documents in the category of communication, based on WoS
database (Figure 1). Although the first OA publication
appeared in the year 2006, there was no significant growth in
free accessibility to scientific publications from 2006 to
2014. A slightly positive growth is seen in the last 2 years,
2015 and 2016.

Comparison Between OA and Non-OA Based
on Type of Documents
To evaluate the differences between OA and non-OA publications in terms of type of document from 2007 till 2017, a
chi-square test was performed to compare the pattern
between OA and non-OA. Figure 2 shows the results of the
statistical analysis of OA and non-OA based on the type of
document. The results show that there was a significant difference between these OA and non-OA regarding the pattern
of document, as seen in Table 1. Relatively, OA is more prevalent in “Book Reviews,” “Editorial Materials,” and
“Reviews,” whereas non-OA is more prevalent in “Articles”
and “Proceeding Papers.”

Top 20 Countries for OA Publication From
2007 to 2017
The total number of OA from 2007 to 2017 was investigated by country. The results for top 20 countries, as summarized in Table 2, show that these 20 countries contributed
92% to OA within 2007 to 2017. The United States had the
highest number of OA documents (n = 2,067), which was
45.16% of the total OA publication in this period, followed
by Spain with 19.29% (n = 883), Brazil with 4% (n = 183),
Argentina with 2.77% (n = 127), and England with 2.38 %
(n = 109). Among the top 10 countries, the majority were
South American countries. Only one country from Asia,
South Korea, emerged among the top 10, with 1.46 %
(n = 67).

Comparison Between OA and Non-OA Based
on Languages
Language was categorized into three groups: English,
Spanish, and other languages, according to the high

frequency languages in both OA and non-OA publications.
Chi-square test was used to compare the pattern of languages
between OA and non-OA. Figure 3 shows results of the analysis. The results indicate that there was a significant difference between OA and non-OA regarding the languages. As
can be seen in Table 3, the frequency of Spanish publications
was higher in OA publication than in non-OA while a majority of the publications were in English in the non-OA, suggesting that the English language dominates the non-OA
publications while the Spanish language dominates the OA
publication from 2007 to 2017.

Open Access Index (OAI)
To evaluate the situation of OA “communication” publications in different years, a new index was created, called the
OAI. It is a ratio of OA publications to total publications.
This index was applied to evaluate the trend of OA growth.
OAI ( Open Access Index ) =

Figure 5. Trend of OAI during 1980 to 2017.
Note. OAI = Open Access Index.

According to the results, three phases of OA development
in communication can be detected. The first phase, inactive
phase, is before 2006. In this phase, there were not any available OA documents in the WoS category of communication.
The second phase started in 2007 and continued to 2014, and
the OAI was almost at 2% of total documents. The third
phase, considered the developing stage, started in 2015, with
an average of 14.5% OAI (Figure 4).
A simple regression method was used to evaluate the
growth rate of OA based on the available data (Figure 5). The
results showed a positive slope between OAI and years with
a moderate R2 value (.46) for the regression line. Using this
equation, OA communication publications are expected to
reach 100% OA by 2094, if following the current trend.

Conclusion
Much is left to be desired in OA communication development. Although the “communication” scholarly outputs consist of a very small portion of the total outputs in all 184
categories in WoS, its degree of “accessibility” is much less
than average, ranked at 116 of 184. This rank, doubtless, is
not acceptable for communication as field. Considering the
huge history of debates and efforts being made to protect the

right of “free accessibility” to information and knowledge in
this field, as well as BOAI recent movements for “accessibility” of scholarly outputs, no reason can be found to justify
such result and rank. When it comes to prediction of the
future trend, surprisingly, the proposed equation for OAI
shows that with the current trend in communication, it will
take 77 years until “communication,” as a field of study, can
reach the goal of being fully OA. Again, undeniably, it can be
considered as “crisis in scientific publishing” as mentioned
by Miguel et al. (2016).
Given this stunning information, it is the time for a
global call for “open access” by communication scholars
across the world. Even prior to this, there should be further
investigation on the epistemological and ontological aspect
of such trends to find a solution to accelerate the “open
access” movement in communication. Further research also
might focus on the current “business models” of publishing
in this area. It is important to evaluate whether the current
business models of publishing are really encouraging
“Open Access” or pose unnecessary restrictions (due to
publication fees/subscription fees) on knowledge development and participation of some segments of the world’s
class scholars, like those in developing and less developed
countries.
