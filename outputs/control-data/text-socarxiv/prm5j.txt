Hierarchies of Categorical Disadvantage: Economic Insecurity at the Intersection of
Disability, Gender, and Race

ABSTRACT

Intersectional feminist scholars emphasize how overlapping systems of oppression structure
gender inequality, but in focusing on the gendered, classed, and racialized bases of stratification,
many often overlook disability as an important social category in determining economic
outcomes. This is a significant omission given that disability severely limits opportunities and
contributes to cumulative disadvantage. We draw from feminist disability and intersectional
theories to account for how disability intersects with gender, race, and education to produce
economic insecurity. The findings from our analyses of 2015 American Community Survey data
provide strong empirical support for hierarchies of disadvantage, where women and racial
minority groups with disabilities and less education experience the highest poverty levels, report
the lowest total income, and have a greater reliance on sources outside the labor market for
economic security. By taking disability into account, our study demonstrates how these multiple
characteristics lead to overlapping oppressions that become embedded and reproduced within the
larger social structure.

INTRODUCTION
Like race, class, and gender, disability is a social category that represents an important
axis of inequality (Jenkins 1991), influencing the lives of at least 12 percent of Americans
(Erickson, Lee, and von Schrader 2018; Lauer and Houtenville 2018). Disability intersects with
race and gender to expand the accumulation of disadvantage, shaping everything from
educational attainment to the kinds of jobs people have, the neighborhoods in which they live,
their access to credit markets and social services, and their health over the life course (DiPrete
and Eirich 2006; Shuey and Willson 2008). However, inclusion of disability as an axis of
inequality in sociology has been less explicitly feminist and intersectional (Davis 2011).
Additionally, despite such diffuse effects, much of the intersectional scholarship on disability
and economic inequality has primarily focused on employment and earnings (Mereish 2012;
Pettinicchio and Maroto 2017; Shaw, Chan, and McMahon 2012) to the detriment of other
economic outcomes. This reflects a major gap in our understanding of economic insecurity and
exposure to risk (Western et al. 2012), especially when considering the numerous employment
barriers faced by women with disabilities.
In light of previous research on the gendered consequences of disability for labor market
outcomes, we address the following research questions: Do the gendered effects of disability
extend to other areas of economic (in)security, such as poverty and total income, which includes
sources other than employment earnings? And, how do these outcomes also vary with
race/ethnicity and education? We use 2015 American Community Survey data to assess variation
in the consequences of disability on poverty and total income in conjunction with gender,
race/ethnicity, and education. Specifically, we interact six major racial and ethnic groups with
gender and disability, as well as college-level education, a major determinant of an individual's

future earnings and class standing, to study the effects of disability on economic insecurity
across disadvantaged groups through a process-centered intersectional model (Choo and Ferree
2010).
We situate our analyses of economic insecurity within intersectionality, feminist theory,
and feminist disability studies. Intersectional and feminist researchers note that the effects of
categorical group membership cannot be understood without considering the overlapping
oppressions built into structures of inequality (Crenshaw 1991; Davis 2008; MacKinnon 2013).
Feminist disability scholars have sought to extend this framework to provide an explicitly
gendered analysis of disability (Garland-Thomson 2002, 2005; Hall 2011). By examining how
“identity-based critical enterprises” have similarly shaped the way we think about the social
construction of ethnic, gendered, queer, and disability categories, they emphasize the interactions
between multiple identities and systems of inequality (Gerschick 2000; Shaw, Chan, and
McMahon 2012). This perspective highlights how socially constructed meanings of disability in
conjunction with race, class, and gender contribute to economic and social marginalization
(Blanck et al. 2007; Doren and Benz 2001; O’Hara 2004).
We find that the negative effects of disability resulted in hierarchies of disadvantage
where women and racial minority groups with disabilities and less education experienced the
highest poverty levels, reported the lowest total income, and had a greater reliance on income
sources outside the labor market for economic security. However, while effects of disability on
poverty were strongest for women, racial minorities, and individuals with less education,
disability presented some of the strongest effects on total income among more advantaged
groups, particularly non-Hispanic white men with higher levels of education, pointing to the
potential ways in which disability can also undermine norms of a masculinity. Framing our

findings of the consequences of disability on economic insecurity through a feminist disability
perspective helps situate disability within social stratification research by highlighting how the
intersection of multiple social categories more broadly marginalizes certain individuals and
groups.

ECONOMIC INSECURITY AS A DIMENSION OF INEQUALITY
Studies of economic insecurity expand on labor market inequality research to consider
the effects of risks and shocks within stratification systems, which often depend on the amount
and nature of economic resources available to weather financial hardship (Hacker et al. 2014;
Osberg and Sharpe 2014; Western et al. 2012). In the United States, economic insecurity has
rapidly increased since the 1970s (Hacker 2006; McCloud and Dwyer 2011). Supported by an
ideology of personal responsibility, government and businesses have gradually divested
themselves from the management of financial risk, limiting social insurance and employment
protections and shifting risk to the individual (Hacker 2006). Declining social safety nets, market
deregulation, and reductions in union strength place additional risk on workers and families. The
consequences of such trends are evident in job losses and increasing debt (Seefeldt 2016), as well
as within rising health problems and drug abuse across groups (Bor, Cohen, and Galea 2017).
Although its effects span the population, rising economic insecurity more negatively impacts
already marginalized groups.
Women, racial minorities, and individuals with less education tend to face greater
hardship and disadvantages than their counterparts. Despite advancements within employment
and education, women, particularly single mothers, experience high levels of economic
insecurity (Shuey and O'Rand 2004; Western et al. 2012) – evidence of the feminization of

poverty (Bianchi 1999) – and often struggle to “build a safety net of savings” (Quadagno 1994;
Willson and Hardy 2002; Willson 2003). Similarly, previous research indicates that the labor
market insufficiently provides financial security for people with disabilities, even with
employment discrimination protections and policies meant to retain employment and increase
earnings (Kruse and Schur 2003; Maroto and Pettinicchio 2014a, 2015).
As a result of persistent labor market inequality, minority groups, including people with
disabilities, often rely on government support, family, and savings, to provide some level of
security. Public assistance, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) are important resources for people with disabilities (Acemoglu and
Angrist 2001; Boursquot and Brault 2013; Weidenbaum 1994). However, even with government
assistance, people with disabilities struggle to “keep their heads above water” in an era of
neoliberal cutbacks to disability programs and pensions (Sherry 2014). Workfare-style programs,
epitomized by the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
(PRWORA, a.k.a. Clinton-era Welfare Reform), for example, worsen rather than help people
with disabilities obtain employment that provides adequate income. This has left many
struggling to achieve basic economic security, as they experience higher rates of poverty and
material hardship (Parish, Rose, and Andrews 2009; She and Livermore 2007).
In light of declining social supports and a more precarious labor market, we examine how
poverty status, total income, and income sources vary with disability, gender, race, and
education. We specifically address how membership in multiple disadvantaged groups
contributes to the accumulation of disadvantage (DiPrete and Eirich 2006) using a processcentered intersectional analysis (Choo and Ferree 2010; McCall 2005) essential to a feminist

disability perspective on the production of inequality (Garland-Thomson 2002, 2005; Linton
1998a, 1998b).

EXAMINING ECONOMIC INSECURITY THROUGH A FEMINIST DISABILITY
PERSPECTIVE
Disability and gender together inform underlying norms and values about “the other,” so
pervasive and deeply embedded that they transcend cultures and institutions. Drawing from the
strengths of both disability studies and feminist traditions, a feminist disability perspective
considers how each social category influences social interaction while simultaneously accounting
for particular experiences unique to the overlap of multiple social categories (Garland-Thomson
2002, 2005). It builds on the sociopolitical analysis in disability studies, which emphasizes how
the meanings society attaches to disability matter more in understanding disability as an axis of
inequality than any so-called objective characteristics (Barnes 1999; Kafer 2013; Linton 1998a,
1998b). Shakespeare (1996) alluded to this when he claimed the sociopolitical model of
disability challenges normative and cultural assumptions about how people come to identify as
disabled rather than how society compares disabled people to an assumed normality that largely
goes undefined.
Disability is an important social category associated with the distribution of social,
economic, and political resources (Maroto and Pettinicchio 2015; Parish, Rose, and Andrews
2009). Disability, however, is still less commonly understood as a source of unequal outcomes in
mainstream sociological work on oppression and inequality. This is partly because of how the
boundaries of disability status are constructed (Barnartt 2013). Disability represents a fluid,
ambiguous, and often invisible category that incorporates both physical and social aspects

(Atkins 2010; Rohrer 2005; Sommo and Chaskes 2013) making it more difficult for scholars to
conceptualize and classify (Altman 2001). Individuals may come in and out of identifying as
disabled over their lifetimes, making disability a "potential status" that becomes more prevalent
with age (Gordon and Rosenblum 2001). As Vernon (1999) suggested, porous and contested
boundaries around disability complicate the development of a politicized disability collective
identity around which to mobilize sociopolitical resources against deeply entrenched structural
inequalities.
In addressing disability as one of many axes of inequality, feminist disability scholars
have done much to shine light on the ways in which ableism as a system of oppression intersects
with racism and sexism (Gill 2016). Like women, people with disabilities receive a lower status
value, tending to be viewed as less competent and less productive than other workers, and as
helpless and weak (Garland-Thomson 2002; Hirschmann 2012; Rohmer and Louvet 2012;
Schwochau and Blanck 2000; Unger 2002; Vaughn, Thomas, and Doyle 2011). Thus, a feminist
disability perspective provides an important framework for understanding the inequalities
embedded in economic systems where women with disabilities are seen as inferior to idealized
white, able-bodied men. This involves taking into account how social categories intersect to
perpetuate inequalities within and between groups.

INTERSECTIONALITY AND HIERARCHIES OF DISADVANTAGE
The intersectionality of socially constructed statuses is an important mechanism that links
group membership to the production of disadvantage in both feminist and feminist disability
traditions. Intersectionality specifically addresses the interaction of different bases of
stratification, as well as broader systems of inequality, subordination, and oppression (Choo and

Ferree 2010; Collins 1990; Crenshaw 1991; MacKinnon 2013; McCall 2005). In other words, it
refers to the "interaction between gender, race, and other categories of difference in individual
lives, social practices, institutional arrangements, and cultural ideologies and the outcomes of
these interactions in terms of power" (Davis 2008, 68). Thus, social categories like race and
gender do not exist independently of each other. Beliefs regarding black men are not identical to
those surrounding black women, and members of these groups hold different statuses, as
evidenced by varying wages, education levels, and rates of incarceration (Browne and Misra
2003; Snipp and Cheung 2016). Returning to Vernon’s (1999, 385) point about disability and
multiple intersecting identities – that "the majority [of people with disabilities] is not a
homogenous mass of disabled white heterosexual middle-class young men" – it is all the more
reason to account for the socioeconomic consequences of simultaneous oppressions.
Although early disability labor market research drew indirect attention to the ways in
which multiple statuses influenced economic outcomes and how disability discrimination
reinforced sex discrimination (Luft 1975; Johnson and Lambrinos 1985), only recently have
studies begun to directly examine how disability intersects with other characteristics in shaping
economic inequality. Many studies indicate that women with disabilities -- “a specific category
of bias” (Kotkin 2008) -- face labor market outcomes that are distinct from those only of people
with disabilities and only women (Acemoglu and Angrist 2001; Pettinicchio and Maroto 2017).
Women with disabilities may be “twice penalized” (O’Hara 2004) or in “double jeopardy”
(Doren and Benz 2001) as a result of structural and attitudinal factors associated with the
intersection of both statuses. Disabled women must contend with (mis)perceptions about skills
and abilities limiting access to stable income (see Jones and Sloane 2010), especially when
employers make hiring, pay, and promotion decisions based on stereotypes that are about a

combination of statuses (Browne and Misra 2003; Greenman and Xie 2008; Hernández 2006;
Shuey and Willson 2017) resulting in multiplicative effects that perpetuate organizational
inequalities (Blanck 1998; Maroto and Pettinicchio 2014b; Shuey and Jovic 2013; Schur 2004).
The intersectionality of multiple statuses thus defines “modern discrimination” (Marchiondo,
Ran, and Cortina, 2015) with real life negative effects on economic security.
Recent work provides compelling evidence for the ways in which stereotypes, attitudes,
and beliefs based on the intersection of multiple social categories contribute to inequality,
marginalization, and disadvantage (see Best et al. 2011). For instance, Mereish (2012) found that
Asian American and Pacific Islander women with disabilities were more likely to report being
discriminated against in the workplace than those without disabilities. In a similar vein, Shaw,
Chan, and McMahon (2012) uncovered unique clusters whereby Mexican and American Indian
women with behavioral disorders were more likely to make harassment complaints. And,
Pilling’s (2012) intersectional analysis of disability, gender, and LGBQT status found that
employees were less likely to disclose mental illness fearing it will undermine their authenticity
as LGBQT disabled people in the eyes of employers.
Intersectional work on labor market outcomes broadly illustrates how disadvantage
accumulates across social categories when certain groups struggle more than others. But, the
effects of intersectional disadvantage do not end with the labor market. They spill into other
related resources, ranging from government assistance to savings and nest eggs, on which
individuals and households rely when employment support is limited (DiPrete and Eirich 2006;
Hacker et al. 2014; Western et al. 2012; Osberg and Sharpe 2014). This is all the more salient in
a context of declining life-long careers and decreasing reliance on employer-employee savings
plans whereby individuals must independently seek out other ways to support their wellbeing

and survival (Hacker 2006). For these reasons, we examine how both total income and poverty
status vary in regard to disability, gender, race, and education, with a particular emphasis on the
ways in which membership in multiple disadvantaged groups contributes to the accumulation of
disadvantage.

DATA, MEASURES, AND METHODS
To investigate whether women and racial minorities with disabilities make up for
inadequate labor market income and whether this helps improve their economic security, we
analyze a sample of adults from the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). As a large crosssectional survey that includes data on disability status and race/ethnicity, along with information
on family structure, education, earnings, and other background characteristics, the ACS is ideal
for analyzing intersecting disadvantage (Ruggles et al. 2017). After restricting our sample to
adults age 18 and older, we obtained a full sample of 2,490,616 individuals for our analyses of
poverty and a sample of 2,233,721 individuals with at least some income for our analyses of total
income.

Outcome Variables
We analyze two primary outcome variables -- total personal income and poverty status -as measures of economic security. Total personal income refers to the respondent's total pre-tax
personal income from all sources in the previous year in 2015 U.S. dollars. It includes income
from the following four areas: employment income from wages and salary and self-employment
from a business, professional practice, or farm; government-related income from public
assistance programs, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security pensions, survivors'

benefits, or permanent disability insurance; savings income from an estate or trust, interest,
dividends, royalties, and rents received and retirement and pensions; and "other" income sources,
which likely include transfers from family members. Because total income can take on negative,
zero, or positive values, we estimate logged total income for a sample of adults with positive
income.
To provide a broader view of economic security for the respondent's household, we also
examine poverty status based on the respondent's standing in relation to the governmentprovided poverty threshold as established by the U.S. Social Security Administration. Poverty
status is assessed in relation to total family income, family size, and respondent's age.
Specifically, we use whether the respondent's household was at or below 100% of the poverty
threshold in the previous year. 2
As shown in Table 1, which presents weighted descriptive statistics for the sample, 15.3
percent of people had incomes at or below the poverty threshold for their area. The majority of
respondents reported some income with a mean of $44,000 among those with income, and 70.2
percent reported wage and salary income with a mean of $32,400. Other types of income were
less common in the sample with 18.8 percent reporting government income from Social Security
income, public assistance, or SSI; 8.5 percent reporting savings-based income; and 2.6 percent
reporting other income.

[Table 1]

2

We also ran our analyses using 200% of the poverty threshold given that poverty levels tend to be set rather low in
the United States and many have criticized these measures for not accurately accounting for true levels of poverty
(Blank 2008; Thorbecke 2007). Our findings (available upon request) were similar using both measures.

Predictor Variables
Our key predictor variables signal membership in different categorical groups and the
intersections between these social categories. We include six racial/ethnic categories -- nonHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, nonHispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, and non-Hispanic other. 3 Instead of relying on a
more complex measure for social class, we focus on differences by education, which we
operationalize as having less than a Bachelor's degree or having obtained a Bachelor's degree or
higher. As most studies show, education is a key factor for earnings and mobility with the largest
divisions among people with and without a university-level education (Hout 2012; Leicht 2008).
Finally, we measure gender as male or female.
Instead of examining differences by race, gender, and education separately, we interact
these variables to create 24 groups across which we assess the consequences of disability. We
use a process-centered model or inter-categorical approach for analyzing intersectional
relationships across groups (Choo and Ferree 2010; McCall 2005) operationalized through the
use of interaction terms. This allows us to study the additive and multiplicative effects of
membership in multiple categorical groups. It also helps to identify certain hierarchies of
disadvantage. Thus, by focusing on intersections among some of the more common categorical
groupings associated with race, class, gender, and disability, we are able to address group
boundaries central to the distribution of resources.
We incorporate disability status based on the six questions that the ACS uses to identify
the population with disabilities (Livermore et al. 2011). These six questions ask whether the
respondent had a cognitive, ambulatory, independent living, self-care, vision, or hearing

3

"Non-Hispanic other" includes individuals who identified multiple primary racial categories.

difficulty. Cognitive difficulties include those related to learning, remembering, concentrating, or
making decisions. Ambulatory difficulties include anything that limits a respondent in one or
more basic physical activities. Independent living difficulties indicate the presence of any
condition lasting six months or more that makes it “difficult or impossible to perform basic
activities outside the home alone.” Self-care difficulties include personal needs. Vision
difficulties indicate whether the respondent was blind or had serious difficulty seeing. Finally,
hearing difficulties indicate whether the respondent was deaf or had serious difficulty hearing.
We measure disability status as individuals who report any disability or limitation based on these
six questions with 15.7 percent of respondents reporting any disability.

Control Variables
Our models include a series of control variables to account for differences in
demographics, education, work history, and context. Because disability prevalence, income, and
poverty rates are highly correlated with age, we control for a person's age and include a quadratic
age squared term to account for any non-linearity in these relationships. As measures of family
structure and situation, we control for marital status, number of children, and family size. To
assess participation in the labor market, which most individuals rely on for income, we include a
measure for whether the respondent worked recently (i.e., worked 1-5 years ago or worked in the
past year). We also control for veteran status, citizenship status, and homeownership, and we
account for context by controlling for region.

Methods
We use a series of descriptive comparisons combined with ordinary least squares
regression models to show how disability's consequences for income and poverty vary by
gender, race, and education, using the statistical program, R. Due to the large number of
intersecting groups present in our data, we summarize most of our analyses in graphical form
with detailed tables available upon request. We apply survey-provided sampling weights to all
analyses and incorporate robust standard errors.

RESULTS
Disability and Poverty Levels
Assessing the gendered consequences of disability for economic security, Table 2
presents results from models predicting the probability of income falling below the poverty line.
Model 1 controls for only the linear and curvilinear effects of age, and Model 2, the full model,
controls for all covariates. Reported results in Table 2 include average marginal effects, which
present the predicted percentage point difference in poverty with results averaged across the
population. Controlling for only age in Model 1, persons with disabilities were more likely to
have incomes that fell below the poverty line across all intersectional groups, but with varying
magnitude. Incorporating control variables in Model 2 decreased disability-related poverty
disparities across groups, but most remained statistically significant and the effects varied by
gender, race, and education.
On average, the effects of disability on poverty were stronger for women and racial
minorities. For instance, disability's effects on poverty were approximately 40% larger for nonHispanic white women than for non-Hispanic white men across education categories.

Additionally, disability's effects on poverty were approximately 55% larger for non-Hispanic
black women than for non-Hispanic white men regardless of education. However, disabilityrelated differences in poverty were most apparent for individuals with lower levels of education.
Among those with a Bachelor's degree or higher, disability was associated with higher rates of
poverty by 1-5 percentage points. Among persons with less education, increases were 2-7
percentage points.

[Table 2]

When considering statuses intersectionally, a hierarchy of disadvantage appears in two
ways. First, disability generally presented the weakest effects on poverty among non-Hispanic
white and Asian/Pacific Islander men with higher education levels. Disability had the largest
effects on poverty among men and women with less than a Bachelor's degree and with racial
identities in the non-Hispanic other category. Disparities by disability status were also larger for
non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women with lower levels of education. Thus, the relative
effects of disability on poverty levels tended to be greater among more disadvantaged groups.
Second, the effects of disability further compounded the effects of race, gender, and
education for members of these social categories. This is evident in Figure 1, which depicts the
predicted percentage of persons within each social category who would have incomes below the
poverty line if all other model covariates were held at their means. Predicted poverty rates were
highest among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native men and women with lower
levels of education. Although disability was not associated with a statistically significant

increase in poverty within these groups, estimates indicate that it likely would have been if this
group was larger and better represented in the data.

[Figure 1]

Disability and Total Income
Expanding on the findings for poverty, Table 3 presents results from regression models
estimating total logged personal income. Model 1 controls for age and Model 2 includes all
control variables. Reported results in Table 3 include the proportional change in total income
associated with disability and model coefficients on a logged scale. 4

[Table 3]

Controlling for age in Model 1, disability appeared broadly disadvantageous with respect
to income levels. Disability was associated with total income declines of 30-40 percent across
groups in this model. Adding controls for family structure, work status, and other factors in
Model 2 resulted in smaller income gaps by disability, as well as disparities that were not
statistically significant for certain groups. Once we accounted for these outside factors, disability
had the greatest effects on income for more advantaged groups, in contrast to our findings on
poverty. Men with higher levels of education tended to experience the largest disability-related
income disparities associated with differences of 20-26 percent, in part, because they simply had

more to lose. This relationship likely stems from the greater reliance by men on employment for
their economic wellbeing, as previous studies show larger earnings declines for men with
disabilities (Pettinicchio and Maroto 2017). We also suspect that these effects are related to
dominant notions of masculinity that can make disability more limiting for men who are less able
to inhabit masculine roles in the labor market (Kavanagh et al. 2015; Shuttleworth, Wedgwood,
and Willson 2012).
Although disability led to the greatest income disparities within more advantaged groups
(i.e., men with a BA or higher), the combined effects of race, gender, education, and disability
still resulted in a hierarchy of income with less-educated women with disabilities earning the
least. This hierarchy is evident in Figure 2, which plots predicted total income by race, gender,
education, and disability status based on the results from Model 2 in Table 3. Women with less
than a Bachelor's reported some of the lowest total income levels with predicted incomes of
approximately $30,000 per year after incorporating control variables. The disparity was
compounded by disability and race where the predicted total annual income for black and
Hispanic women with disabilities was approximately $26,000 per year with other variables set at
their means. This relationship further demonstrates the accumulation of disadvantage across
multiple social categories, expanding on previous studies that have focused solely on gender and
disability (Johnson and Lambrinos 1985; Kotkin 2008; Pettinicchio and Maroto 2017) or race
and disability (Mereish 2012; Shaw, Chan, and McMahon 2012) in the labor market.

[Figure 2]

Unlike studies centered on only employment earnings, we examined a broader measure
of total personal income that comprises income from multiple sources -- employment,
government, savings, and other areas -- all of which can help to improve economic security
across groups (Osberg and Sharpe 2014; Western et al. 2012). Although most groups rely on the
labor market for the majority of their income, others, particularly less advantaged groups, depend
on sources beyond the labor market. This is especially true for persons with disabilities, as
shown in Figure 3.
For the persons represented in the first column of Figure 3, which includes race, gender,
and education groups without disabilities, the vast majority of their income came from
employment. This was not the case for a majority of persons with disabilities in the second
column. People with disabilities, especially women with less education and disabilities in Panel
B, relied on government sources for most of their limited income. Women and men with higher
levels of education (Panels D and H), however, were able to also take advantage of savings to
make up for limited income. Although disparities in total income by race, gender, education, and
disability were readily present, government supports, savings, and other sources helped mitigate
the overall effects of lower earnings. Even with such supports, economic insecurity, as evidenced
by higher poverty levels and lower total income, was still an issue for members of disadvantaged
groups.

[Figure 3]

DISCUSSION
Feminist disability and intersectional approaches synthesize key tenets rooted in both
feminist (Feree and Hall 1996) and disability studies (Linton 1998a, 1998b; Shakespeare 1996).
As such, they provide a useful framework for making sense of the ways in which the effects of
disability on poverty and total income are gendered, raced, and classed. Through the use of a
series of inter-categorical models (McCall 2001, 2005), we expand on feminist disability
analyses by shedding light on hierarchies of disadvantage. Our results indicate that the
intersection of these social categories is associated with economic insecurity, pointing to the
ways in which certain characteristics become salient markers for inequality, how multiple
characteristics lead to overlapping oppressions, and how this has become embedded within the
larger social structure.
More specifically, by moving beyond employment and earnings, our analyses of poverty
status, total income, and income composition revealed a hierarchy of disadvantage across
measures of economic insecurity where racial minority women with disabilities and less
education had the highest rates of poverty and the lowest total income levels. We also found that
members of disadvantaged groups, especially people with disabilities, do not necessarily obtain
most of their income from the labor market. This alludes to the value of public assistance as an
important supplement to persons with disabilities and other marginalized groups with limited
employment income. Without assistance, poverty rates would be much higher for members of
these groups. Yet, welfare cuts and a policy emphasis on workfare doubly stigmatize people with
disabilities, first, for being “unable” to work and, second, for receiving benefits to keep them out
of poverty (Whittle et al. 2017).

Disadvantage thereby accumulates across social categories demonstrating the need to
account for the particular experiences of individuals with overlapping group memberships
(McCall 2005). However, intersectional effects are not always straightforward. Although the
effects of disability on poverty were strongest for the most disadvantaged groups, disability's
effects on total income were larger for more advantaged groups that include white men with
higher education (see also Pettinicchio and Maroto 2017), which further highlights the
importance of using intersectionality to study advantage and privilege, along with disadvantage.
Although our study goes beyond most to incorporate disability, race, gender, and
education into intersectional research on economic insecurity, our results do face certain
limitations. Given data restrictions, we use somewhat rough measures of race, education, gender,
and disability, and we were unable to incorporate measures of sexuality or sexual identity, which
are important to intersectional and feminist disability studies (Caldwell 2010; Garland-Thomson
2002; Kafer 2013). Effects also likely vary by the specific nature of a person's disability. For
instance, previous research has shown that the presence of cognitive and multiple disabilities
tends to be more limiting in the labor market than sensory or physical disabilities (Maroto and
Pettinicchio 2014b), which has implications for poverty and total income. Due to sample size
issues, however, examining many refined categories results in groups that are simply too small to
make strong conclusions about due to the noise present in the sample. Despite these limitations,
our study still emphasizes the importance of incorporating smaller intersectional groups -especially understudied racial minority groups and persons with disabilities.
Furthermore, it is difficult to avoid the "pitfalls of additive approaches to multiple
identities" when using quantitative data to assess disadvantages across multiple groups (Bowleg
2008; Conejo 2013). We cannot fully address the overlapping structures of subordination (Cho et

al. 2013), nor are we able to directly uncover the mechanisms that produce categorical
inequality. However, by incorporating a process-centered or inter-categorical model of
intersectional relations, we still show where disparities exist and why it is imperative that
disability be included in discussions of inequality. As we find, when disability, gender,
race/ethnicity, and class status overlap, the meanings associated with membership in these
categorical groups compound to expand cumulative disadvantage.
Given the evidence we present about hierarchies of disadvantage, future work should
consider how the nature of disability intersects with other characteristics to shape economic
outcomes given that disability type plays a major role in determining access to resources. This
would also represent a step forward in elucidating the ways in which individuals access
alternative sources of income to weather economic uncertainty and prevent falling into poverty.
These perspectives are useful in unpacking how disability acts as both a cause and consequence
of poverty, especially as it intersects with race and gender in explaining cumulative disadvantage
(see Kelley-Moore and Ferraro 2004; Warner and Brown 2011; Willson and Shuey 2016).

CONCLUSION
The sociopolitical model of disability draws important linkages between the struggles of
diverse minority groups in undermining inequalities produced by economic and political systems
(Gill 2015; see also Skrentny 2002; Pettinicchio 2012, 2013, 2017). It has focused attention on
the importance of identity and the social construction of “impairment specific labels” both within
and outside the disability community in shaping social interaction (see Oliver and Barnes 1998;
Deal 2010). Consequently, the focus on power and oppression based on the meanings associated

with disability (Tremain 2013) has been mutually beneficial to feminist, disability, and
stratification research.
Intersectional feminist scholarship has been important to the development and expansion
of disability studies (Sommo and Chaskes 2013; Mauldin 2017) especially because disability is a
fluid status and the disability community a heterogeneous one. Theorizing disability through a
feminist lens underscores the ways in which disadvantage is reproduced in all social
organizations within a “disability/ability system” that associates disabled bodies (much like
female bodies) with inadequacy and weakness, saying "that there’s something wrong with them"
(Garland-Thomson 2002, 5; 1994; 2005; Linton 1998a; Hirschmann 2012). This perspective
further exposes disability as a social category, highlights its pervasiveness and mutability and,
importantly, emphasizes interaction with other identities, which sheds light on inequality’s
durability based on the norms, labels, meanings, and values attached to overlapping identities.
A central feature guiding each of these constantly evolving frameworks involves the
interaction of individuals with social institutions and organizations governed by oppression and
marginalization at both the micro and macro levels. Early feminists challenged male-centric
Marxist understandings of power relations, domination, and oppression (Acker 2006), and
intersectionality scholars criticized feminist theory for its heavy reliance on the experiences of
white middle-class women ignoring the racialized bases of gendered inequality (McCall 2005).
In that vein, feminist disability studies did not simply -- to modify a phrase from Feree and Hall
(1996, 929) -- “add disability and stir” but rather has sought to revise sociological
understandings of oppression, inequality, and disadvantage. Process-centered models described
by Choo and Ferree (2010), for example, consider the effects of intersecting statuses like
disability with gender on economic outcomes vis-à-vis the main effects of disability and gender.

Thus, by uncovering the gendered, racialized, and classed aspects of disability’s impact on total
income and poverty, we link intersectionality to cumulative disadvantage, showing how the
multifaceted relationships between multiple identities influence economic insecurity.

group. These are calculated by averaging the predicted probabilities of poverty across the population. Pseudo R 2 values
for Model 1 range from 0.015 (Hispanic Women with HS Diploma or Less) to 0.091 (Non-Hispanic American Indian or
Alaskan Native Women with BA or Above). Average value was 0.043. Pseudo R2 values for Model 2 range from 0.170
(Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native Women with HS Diploma or Less) to 0.314 (Non-Hispanic American
Indian or Alaskan Native Men with BA or Above). Average value was 0.245.

NOTES: Regression results from models predicting total logged income. Each estimate and standard error refers to the
effects of disability within a model restricted to the listed categorical group. "e b - 1" can be interpreted as a percent change
in income associated with the presence of a disability when multiplied by 100. Model 1 controls for age and age squared.
Model 2 includes controls for all covariates. Pseudo R2 values for Model 1 range from 0.035 (Non-Hispanic White Women
with BA or Above) to 0.204 (Non-Hispanic Other Men with a HS Diploma or Less). Average value was 0.110. Pseudo R2
values for Model 2 range from 0.134 (Non-Hispanic White Women with BA or Above) to 0.302 (Non-Hispanic White Men
with a HS Diploma or Less). Average value was 0.223.

SOURCE: 2015 ACS, adults age 18 and older with income, N = 2,233,721
NOTES: Estimates refer to percentage of total income attributable to employment, government, savings,
and other sources for race, gender, education, and disability groups. Mean refers to the predicted average
total personal income for individuals in that group based on the results from Table 3 Model 2 and shown
in Figure 2. This helps to demonstrate the lower incomes for disadvantaged groups.
