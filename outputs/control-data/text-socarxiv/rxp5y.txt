Abstract
Using data on poliomyelitis and typhoid fever mortality in the United
States, 1914–69, we test competing theories for the twentieth century
expansion of polio. We analyze data stratified by age, sex, and race.
We show that some of the seemingly-paradoxical aspects of the data
— principally, that whites had higher polio death rates than nonwhites
but lower typhoid death rates — are consistent with the polio hygiene
hypothesis. Data on racial differences show that the hygiene hypothesis is necessary and sufficient to explain patterns of polio mortality in
the United States. Epidemiological phenomena are best understood in
their social context.

Introduction
The hygiene hypothesis in polio epidemiology holds that the emergence of polio
in the twentieth century stemmed, counterintuitively, from better hygiene,
specifically, the increasing purity of drinking water. The explanation is that
dirty water contains inoculating doses of poliovirus. As economic development made water supplies cleaner and cleaner, this inoculating function
dissipated, such that exposure to poliovirus could cause frank disease (viz.,
paralysis). There are other “hygiene hypotheses” in medicine (f.e., Mekhaiel
et al., 2011) which are not directly related.
Recent work proposed an alternate hypothesis to account for historical
patterns of polio in the United States: “...contrary to the prevailing ‘disease
of development’ hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio’s historical
expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather
than improvements in sanitation and hygiene” (Martinez-Bakker et al., 2015,

p.1). This demographic hypothesis is a fascinating recasting of the theory
of polio’s expansion in the twentieth century. Coupled with results from a
mathematical model, it shows that state polio incidence is correlated with
birth rates, especially vis-à-vis the large postwar polio epidemics and the
baby boom:
Our results suggest the marked increase in polio incidence from
the 1930s to the 1950s was a straightforward consequence of increased birth rates..., and that hygiene effects on transmission
are not required to explain polio’s rise to epidemic levels. (ibid.,
p.13)
We consider the two competing polio hypotheses (hygiene, birth-rate) in
light of data on white and nonwhite polio mortality in the twentieth century in the United States. We show that the birth rate explanation does not
explain the observed mortality patterns. On the other hand, the hygiene hypothesis — that: “[changes in polio epidemiology] would follow a reduction
in the transmission of enteric infections generated by improved sanitation
and hygiene” (Nathanson and Martin, 1979, p.678) — is compatible with
the mortality data.
Infectious diseases are bio-social phenomena, not exclusively biological
ones (Rosenberg, 1962). Thus, it makes sense in the United States to consider race whenever the data permit it, especially given the racially-imprinted
nature of American mortality (Preston et al., 2003). Diseases spread by
drinking water are especially important in this regard (Troesken, 2004). This
is as true today as historically (f.e., Hanna-Attisha et al., 2016). When taking
racial differences into account, the hygiene hypothesis provides a parsimonious account of polio mortality in the United States. In light of racial data
on mortality from poliomyelitis and typhoid fever, we show that the hygiene
hypothesis has major explanatory power.

The hygiene hypothesis in polio epidemiology
The hygiene hypothesis is associated with Neal Nathanson (Nathanson and
Martin 1979, Nathanson et al. 1993, Nathanson and Kew 2010). For example:
. . . the appearance of epidemic poliomyelitis was due, paradoxically, to improvements in public sanitation and in personal hygiene, both of which led to a reduction in the transmission of
enteric agents such as poliovirus. A delay in the age of initial
2

infection with poliovirus beyond the age when infants were protected by passively acquired maternal antibody is postulated to
increase the risk of clinical disease. (Nathanson et al. 1993, p.8)
Some of the ideas that are part of the hygiene hypothesis were present in the
polio literature before Nathanson’s refinement, f.e., Sabin (1947), Van Riper
(1947), Rivers (1948), Aycock and Meadors (1948), Paul (1952), Horstmann
(1953, 1955), and Rhodes (1955). Earlier still, Collins (1946) and Melnick
and Ledinko (1951) noted that in regions free of epidemic poliomyelitis,
there was a steep acquisition by age of poliovirus-neutralizing antibodies,
indicating high levels of exposure despite lack of outbreaks.
According to the hygiene hypothesis, improvements in sanitation set in
train a series of events that led, perversely, to more, not less, disease. By
“disease”, we mean symptomatic (viz., paralytic) polio — not any polio infection. Poliovirus spreads via the fecal-oral route (Dömök, 1985), i.e., principally through water that is contaminated with human coliform bacteria.
Poliovirus “rides along”, so to say, with waterborne bacteria (Pfeiffer, 2010).
First and foremost, poliovirus causes enteric disease, specifically diarrhea,
although gut infection can take place even without gastrointestinal symptoms. Throughout, when we refer to subclinical cases of polio, we mean
non-paralytic; many of these would have manifest as a bout of diarrhea, so
were not, strictly speaking, completely free of symptoms. In a minority of
cases, viremia (i.e., bloodstream infection) occurs, and in a subset of these
cases, the nervous system is infected, causing some degree of paralysis, usually of the limbs (Dömök, 1985). Polio-associated paralysis may be transient
or permanent. Mortality occurs when the diaphragm is affected, causing
respiratory arrest.
As drinking water became cleaner, it was less likely, all else equal, that
an individual would encounter poliovirus. Age is a proxy for cumulative
exposure to water (and hence, to infectious doses of poliovirus). With improvements in hygiene, initial exposure to poliovirus occurred (on average)
at older ages, by which maternal antibodies had waned. The cleaner the
water (unless perfectly free of contamination), then the older, on average,
someone would contract polio.
In the pre-vaccine era, mothers were mostly survivors of apparent or subclinical polio, themselves. Thus, their babies were born with high levels of
transplacentally-acquired antibodies, known as maternal antibodies. In the
less sanitary past, exposures to small doses of poliovirus were constant and
maternal antibodies were strong. This set up a scenario such that, during the
period in which they were still protected by maternal antibodies, infants and
3

children built up their own immune response to polio through subclinical
infections. As Zinkernagel (2002) put it, “The passive transfer of maternal
antibodies to the offspring at birth protects completely, then attenuates infections in the first months and nursing years by rendering infections effectively
vaccine-like” (p.117, emphasis added); see also Zinkernagel (2001). Vaccineinduced immunity to polio can be conferred even in the presence of maternal
polio antibodies (Schoub et al. 1988, Maldonado et al. 1997, Asturias et al.
2007). It stands to reason that natural subclinical infection should do the
same, and that infection in the face of high levels of maternal antibodies
would, indeed, be subclinical.
The equilibrium before hygienic improvements — when exposure to poliovirus was a given — was that children, as they grew older, passed through
a “sweet spot.” Maternal (i.e., trans-placental) antibodies protected infants
from polio at birth, who were then able to develop protective immunity as
these antibodies waned enough to allow subclinical (non-paralytic) infection. As the twentieth century progressed, subclinical reinfections became
less common, reducing immune boosting. Across generations, this caused
waning of maternal antibody at younger ages, because antibody levels were
reduced in mother and therefore in child. This, in turn, narrowed the window of opportunity for infection to be “vaccine-like”.
During the twentieth century, in country after country, well-documented
epidemics of paralytic polio followed in the wake of improvements in drinking water. Payne (1955) writes: “Within the last decade or so, many countries have experienced relatively serious outbreaks of poliomyelitis for the
first time”; see also Sabin (1949) and Candioti et al. (1949). This is consistent with the hygiene hypothesis and applies to a diverse set of countries
at different stages of their demographic transitions (on which, cf.. Kirk,
1996). Infection of travelers to countries in which there was no epidemic
polio (May 1950) indicates that poliovirus had a worldwide distribution despite not showing an epidemic pattern in all regions; a similar effect can
be seen with expatriate Europeans living in Casablanca, compared to Moroccans (Paul and Horstmann, 1955). Countries in the pre-epidemic phase
had not yet crossed the threshold of sufficient sanitation to permit polio epidemics (Paul 1958, Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky and Stone 2005). At least in
the United States, water quality improvement was a gradual, place-by-place
process (Meeker, 1971; Condran and Crimmins-Gardner, 1978; Cutler and
Miller, 2005).
Figure 1 shows a classic finding by Paul and Horstmann (1955), of antibody prevalence in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1953. At birth, effectively all

infants have neutralizing (maternal) polio antibodies, which decline during
infancy. Neutralizing antibodies return during the childhood years, as a result of (subclinical) poliovirus infection “without a high incidence of the
recognized paralytic disease” (ibid., p.522). The compliment fixing antibody
curves show the age pattern of relatively-recently acquired polio immunity
(approximately, the prior 36 months), and are consistent with the pattern
seen in the persistent neutralizing antibodies. The protection afforded by antibodies is mostly homotypic (Nathanson and Martin, 1979; Dömök, 1985),
although early assays did not have excellent specificity among the three
types (Melnick et al., 1954).1 These are cross-sectional data, so their in1 To the extent to which protection is heterotypic, type 2 polio infection may protect against

terpretation in terms of cohort experiences requires assuming a stable equilibrium, which is reasonable given the lack of outbreaks of paralytic disease. Similar findings for Tahiti are shown by Horstmann et al. (1955) and
Kessel et al. (1956), for Cairo, Egypt by Goldblum and Melnick (1952) and
Paul et al. (1952a), for Alaska natives by Paul et al. (1952b), and for some
South American and Caribbean populations by Melnick (1959). Turner et al.
(1950) also compile similar data for several populations (see especially their
figures 6 and 7).
With improvements in sanitation, the first dose of poliovirus was more
likely to be in a completely immuno-naïve individual, so was more likely to
produce severe disease. Changes in birth cohort sizes are absent from the hygiene hypothesis, because they are not necessary for it. As societies became
more hygienic, the force of infection of polio lowered, shifting the age distribution of infection upwards (on the force of infection and its inverse relation
with the mean age of infection, cf. Grenfell and Anderson, 1985). The age effect was so profound, that contemporary observers attributed enormous importance to age-severity relationships (Horstmann, 1955, 1963; Nathanson
and Martin, 1979). However, age is not the key factor in the hygiene hypothesis. Except as regards crossing the threshold of maternal antibody protection, age matters only because it is a proxy for cumulative exposure to polio
virus. Moreover, following hygienic improvements, the average age of infection increases over time partly through cohort effects. For instance, suppose,
hypothetically, that (mostly) clean water is imposed all-at-once. Ten years
later, most ten year-olds will be susceptible to polio, whereas before, most
were immune. After five more years, most fifteen year-olds will be susceptible to polio (modulo those who were infected and recovered, or died, in the
interval), and so on.

Hygiene hypotheses
The polio hygiene hypothesis suggests the following sub-hypotheses, relative
to the United States’ experience:
1. As water supplies became cleaner, polio death rates at ages above infancy should increase, until the advent of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in 1955 (Francis and Korns, 1955; Francis, 1955).
2. Polio mortality rate increases seen during the twentieth century should
be more profound in people above age 5 than in infants and children.
6

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

3. Nonwhites, as a group, had inferior access to clean water. Therefore,
polio death rates among nonwhites should:
(a) increase less over the twentieth century, compared to whites;
(b) be lower than among whites, except during infancy;
(c) decline in the post-vaccine era (assuming equal access to IPV).
4. Apart from general considerations of sex differences in mortality (f.e.,
Ciocco, 1940a,b; Nathanson, 1984), these patterns (in 1–3) should be
the same by sex.
These derive from the hygiene hypothesis and rest on the principle of mortality rates as an indicator of severe disease. Regarding 3b, note that before
vaccine-protected mothers started having children themselves, most infants
were born with high levels of maternal antibodies (Tanzi et al., 1997). Therefore, to die of polio in infancy meant exposure to a large enough inoculum to
overcome maternal antibodies, which we expect to occur more often among
those drinking less clean water (viz., nonwhites, as we will demonstrate
from typhoid fever mortality).

Data
To test these hypotheses, we examine polio death rates by age, race, and sex
in the United States Death Registration area, 1914–32, and in the United
States, 1933–69. For simplicity, we refer to the data for the entire time span,
1914–69, as being for the United States. Prior to 1933, the data we use
do not cover the entire country (Hetzel, 1997, pp.43–66). Because of our
racial-comparative approach, the incompleteness of death registration prior
to 1933 is not a major obstacle; the area being compared is always the same
(viz., across races, holding year constant). The data sources are listed in Appendix A (p.25). To the best of our knowledge, there are no published data
on age-, race- and sex-specific polio death rates prior to 1914. The impact
of vaccination necessitates stopping our analysis in 1969. In the late 1960s,
polio death rates were less than one per million in our demographic groups,
and some years had zero deaths in some age/sex/race cells. The death rates
we examine are racially categorized as white/nonwhite, with no finer granularity available in the source data. In this time period, the nonwhite population of the United States was overwhelmingly black or African-American
(Lerner, 1975).

source: Project Tycho (2016).

The key aspect of our analysis by race is that nonwhites were drinking
dirtier water. We use typhoid fever as a comparison disease because “the
typhoid-fever death-rate of the community will fairly well represent the
sanitary quality of the water-supply” (Whipple, 1907, p.7); cf. also Whipple (1908), p.77. For more recent use of typhoid death rates as an index of
water quality, see Higgs and Booth (1979), Ewbank (1987), Troesken (2001),
Condran and Lentzner (2004), Cutler and Miller (2005), Ferrie and Troesken
(2008), and Beach et al. (2016). Typhoid vaccination had a negligible impact on mortality (Collins and Councell, 1943). Both poliovirus and the
typhoid fever pathogen (the bacterium Salmonella enterica seroytype typhi,
sometimes called S. typhi) are spread by the fecal-oral route (i.e., principally
8

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

through contaminated drinking water), which makes typhoid an appropriate comparison disease. Figure 2 is a time series plot of weekly incidence
(not mortality) of typhoid fever and poliomyelitis in the United States, 1928–
69, using data from Project Tycho (2016). The absolute levels are difficult
to interpret, for two reasons. First, the data are subject to reporting-area
changes over time (van Panhuis et al., 2013), and as a result, these are reported cases, not rates. Second, especially for polio, these are systematically
underreported. For every case of clinical (i.e., paralytic) polio there are 100–
1,000 inapparent infections (Melnick and Ledinko 1953, Horstmann 1963).
Subclinical infection occurred in up to 70% of household contacts of polio
cases (Isacson et al., 1957). Figure 3 demonstrates that both of these waterborne diseases have the same seasonal pattern, so are highly appropriate
comparison diseases. The seasonality in figure 3 coheres with contemporary
detailed virological surveillance (Honig et al., 1956). Where typhoid and polio differ is that reinfection can occur with typhoid fever (Parry et al., 2002),
whereas polio infection confers lifelong immunity. For this reason, typhoid
fever death rates do not decline as steeply with age.

Results
Typhoid fever
Figure 3 shows typhoid fever mortality in the United States, 1914–69. It
contains time series plots of typhoid death rates, separately by sex and by age
groups: 0, 1–4, 5–14, 25–34, and 35–44 years. Within each age/sex panel, the
races (white, nonwhite) are plotted independently. Throughout this period,
at age 45 and above, polio death rates (to which these typhoid data will be be
compared) were extremely low among all race/sex combinations — on the
order of 1 death per million population, or less. Thus, the age groups from
which meaningful comparisons may be drawn are shown in figure 3 and
in figure 5 (for polio). Appendix B (p.26) gives some descriptive statistics of
these data (tables 1–6), and explains the gaps in the series. Tables 7–12 (also
in appendix B) summarize tests of statistical significance of white/nonwhite
differences. Throughout, we use α = 0.05 as the significance level (type I
error rate).
The data in figure 3 are quite straightforward. Typhoid fever death rates
show a consistent decline throughout the twentieth century before virtually
vanishing in the 1950s and ’60s due to a combination of clean water and
antibiotic drugs. Nonwhite typhoid death rates are consistently higher than

those for whites. These racial gaps are statistically significant in most years
(Appendix B, tables 7–12). There are some years in which the differences are
non-significant, especially in years in which there are few deaths. There are
no years in which whites have higher typhoid death rates in a statisticallysignificant way, but many years in which nonwhites’ excess is statistically
significant.
Figure 4 shows the same data, recast as the nonwhite/white death rate
ratio. This visualizes striking racial differences: sometimes a 10× higher typhoid fever death rate for nonwhites. These results are consistent enough
that the distinction between ratio or difference is not important (cf. Sheps,
1958, 1959). Figures 3 and 4 amply demonstrate that nonwhite Americans
had inferior access to clean drinking water in this time period (Troesken,
2001). Blacks living in the rural south were drinking dirtier water, in many
cases because they lacked piped water, tout court (Cowhig and Beale, 1964a,b).
No typhoid coming in through pipes is no guarantee that alternate water
sources are clean, and the difficulty of hand-washing in such situations enhances person-to-person typhoid transmission (as well as that of poliovirus,
Dömök 1985).

Poliomyelitis
Having shown that nonwhites were drinking dirtier water, we turn here
to the main analysis: poliomyelitis mortality. Figure 5 shows polio death
rates in the United States, 1914–69. A number of patterns are noteworthy. Particularly at younger ages, the 1916 polio epidemic in the northeast,
which struck New York especially hard (Lavinder et al., 1918; Trevelyan et al.,
2005b), can be seen clearly. The national data mask the epidemic nature of
polio. For example, if there is an epidemic one year in Chicago, the next year
in Milwaukee, in San Antonio the year after that, and so on, the aggregate
time series picture does not necessarily look like one of outbreak/quiescent
cycles (Gilliam et al., 1949a,b; Trevelyan et al., 2005a).2
Of course, the entire pattern of poliomyelitis mortality can be regarded
as a fifty-year epidemic. Consider, especially, the series in figure 5 for whites,
ages 25–34 — which rose slowly and then came crashing down upon the
intervention of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in 1955. Indeed, “it
is rare for a serious disease to be controlled so quickly and dramatically as
was poliomyelitis” (Melnick, 1993, p.191). The increase in polio mortality
2 This is well studied with measles, f.e., Bartlett (1957); Murray and Cliff (1977); Leeuwenburg et al. (1979); Cliff et al. (1992a,b).

among whites in the 1940s and early ’50s, was socially significant (Rogers,
1992, 2014; Oshinsky, 2005); it was, after all, the post-penicillin era, in which
the expectation was that infectious diseases should be vanquished. Consider
also the remarkable pattern that white polio death rates in the early 1950s
didn’t decline with age until the 35–44 age group (discussed further, below).
The racial comparisons for polio are very different than those for typhoid.
Figure 6 shows that despite (or, indeed, because of) drinking cleaner water,
whites had higher polio death rates than nonwhites for most observations
above infancy. Differences post-1955 have to do with IPV. For instance, death
rates are lower for nonwhites in the 5–14 age group for virtually the whole
period, 1914–1955 (figure 6) and then reverse after the mid 1950s. We attribute this to differential access to vaccination. We have little data on polio vaccination rates by race, but what documentation we have found shows
that lower socioeconomic groups had lower vaccination rates (Melnick et al.,
1961, p.1160).3 Appendix C (p.40) shows that the nonwhite/white mortality
ratio seen for typhoid fever is (broadly) similar to that seen for other infectious diseases (except polio), underscoring how unusual the polio patterns
are from a racial perspective.

Age-mortality profiles
The data in figures 3 and 5 can be re-visualized as age-mortality profiles
(plots with age on the horizontal axis and mortality rates on the vertical
axis). This is done in figures 7 (typhoid) and 8 (polio); the vertical axis is
inverse hyperbolic sine-transformed.4 Each panel of figures 7 and 8 shows
one race×sex combination. To illustrate the evolution, four years (1920, ’30,
’40, ’50) are shown. Another way to compare age-mortality profiles is to use
a heatmap; these are presented using all years in Appendix D (p.42).
The patterns for typhoid (figure 7) are straightforward. Each mortality
profile is nested beneath the chronologically-previous one, with the slight
exception of 1920/30 for nonwhite males. These graphs show progress, in
which the age-mortality profiles sink over time. For whites, by 1950, typhoid
fever death rates were zero or nearly zero for all ages. For nonwhites, there is
also decline, but the age-mortality profile in 1950 is not flat, although it has
changed shape relative to the earlier years. The 1950 curve for nonwhites
is convex, having maxima at the extremes of age, while those for 1920 and

1930 are concave, having a maximum in the 15–24 age group; 1940 has both
convex and concave sections. The nonwhite age mortality profiles reflect
reduced access to clean water compared to whites, persisting even to 1950.
What is more — since these are death rates, not incidence — the nonwhite
mortality may reflect less access to antibiotics, especially chloramphenicol
after 1948 (Hornick, 1992). Earlier antibiotics proved less effective against
typhoid fever (Parsons, 1948). Although work on typhoid fever vaccines goes
back to the nineteenth century (Gröschel and Hornick, 1981), these are not
regarded as having played a role in the decline of typhoid mortality at the
population level (McCaw, 1919; Levine and Blake, 1992).
The relatively flat age-mortality profiles for typhoid (i.e., compared to polio, figure 8) reflect the lack of long-lasting immunity. Children show lower
typhoid mortality than adults in figure 7. This may be due to misattribution
of typhoid deaths among children (Troesken, 2004, p.28). Alsan and Goldin

(2018) show declines in all-cause child mortality when water was improved,
which is consistent with the misattribution hypothesis. Alternatively, milk
pasteurization could have had more positive effects on children than adults.
The extent to which pasteurization lowered typhoid death rates is unclear
(Frost, 1916; Sydenstricker, 1928). Adults had higher typhoid death rates
than children going back to 1900 if not before (U.S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, 1956). This, again, argues for the classification
problems, not a massive impact of pasteurization. In any case, the take home
message from figure 7 is that, regarding typhoid, things got better over time.
Reflecting the complex epidemiology of poliomyelitis, the patterns in figure 8 are more complicated. The discrimination between the curves is harder
because they are overlapping, not nested. First, consider the age-mortality
profiles for polio for 1920 (solid line pattern in figure 8). The earliest data
series in this figure is also the lowest — this is not the picture of progress
17

as seen with typhoid. With polio, the earliest (1920) age-mortality profiles
are the easiest to explain. Death rates declined steeply by age in 1920, in all
demographic groups. Water was (comparatively) dirty, so even infants with
maternal antibodies could become infected. At older ages, death rates declined because these individuals grew up with even dirtier water, and most
had acquired immunity to polio (not all, as death rates were still above zero,
except nonwhite males in 15–24 and 25–34 year age groups). Survival to
older ages selected for individuals with upbringings in higher socioeconomic
status households. This selection also is for greater susceptibility to polio,
which is partly why polio death rates are not even lower at older ages in
1920. See Kurland et al. (2009) and Zajacova and Burgard (2013) on this
type of mortality selection.
For the later polio age-mortality profiles, consider them separately by
race. For whites, there are declines over time of polio death rates for infants
and children. Cleaner water is less capable of “punching through” infants’
maternal antibodies. As water improved, mortality rates in this age group
fell over time. The age-mortality profiles after 1920 do not decline by age
anywhere near as steeply as in 1920. The 1930 and 1940 curves are quite
similar, indicating stalled progress against polio.
The most profound feature of figure 8 is how the 1950 curve is the highest (i.e., worst) for most ages — for whites only (bottom two panels). Polio in the pre-vaccine era was sometimes called “infantile paralysis” (Paul,
1971). Yet, mortality rates at the population level among whites were as
high or higher for 5–14 year-olds as they were for infants.5 Indeed, by 1950,
the polio death rates among whites are virtually a plateau by age, with the
most profound declines not occurring until the 35–44 age group.
The top two panels of figure 8 are for nonwhites. Females (upper right)
show the pattern which is easiest to interpret. Polio mortality for nonwhite
infants and girls fell over time, particularly considering 1920 and 1930 (together) as one time step, and 1940 and 1950 as another. This is because by
1940 water improvements (on average) had belatedly come to the nonwhite
population, so poliovirus was less able to puncture partial immunity, as discussed above. For older nonwhites (i.e., above age 5 for 1920 and 1930, or
above age 15 for 1940 and 1950), polio death rates are low because members
of these cohorts grew up with dirty water, and were immune. The pattern for
nonwhite males is a little more complex, with 1920 having unambiguously
the lowest death rate at older ages. The age-mortality profiles for nonwhite

males resembles those of white males a little more than nonwhite females
vis-à-vis whites. Nonetheless, nonwhites show the expected pattern of a
population drinking dirty water: polio death rates are lower in adults than
in infants and children.

The postwar baby boom
If the baby boom catalyzed the increase in polio in the 1950s, we should
expect divergent patterns in the increase in births, by race. Figure 9 (left
panel) gives annual births in the United States, 1917–60, by race. The baby
boom is clearly visualized, and occurs for both racial groups. The right panel
of figure 9 is a log-log plot of nonwhite versus white births; the slope of the
regression line is the elasticity (Greene, 1997, p.227), or the percent change
in nonwhite births for a percent change in white births. The data are a good
fit to a straight line (R2 = 85.5%), affirming that the baby boom was not a
whites-only phenomenon.
Figure 10 presents another scale-free way to depict the changes in white
and nonwhite births. This is a time series of the year-on-year percent change
in births, by race.6 The two racial groups are in good synchrony according

to this measure. The white baby boom was a bit more of a percussion, with
1946 having over 20% more births than 1945, compared to just over 10%
for nonwhites. On the other hand, in 1948 compared to ’47, whites showed
a decline in births whereas the baby boom for nonwhites continued. The
picture from figures 9 and 10 is that — modulo some small differences —
both whites and nonwhites experienced a baby boom of similar timing and
similar proportional size.

Discussion
Nonwhites consistently had dirtier water, as shown by figures 3 and 4 which
give absolute and relative typhoid mortality rates by race. Typhoid fever is
a waterborne infection for which the hygiene hypothesis does not apply because there is no lasting immunity. Consider especially figure 4, where the
data are always (except two points) on or above the line of equality (i.e.,
nonwhite mortality rates greater than or equal to those for whites). Moreover, many of the values at 1.0 in figure 4 denote equal values because death
rates are zero for both racial groups (i.e., 0/0 is treated as equality). For typhoid, there are two years (per sex) in which the nonwhite/white ratio is 1.0
but the underlying values are not zero.
Compared to typhoid, the polio mortality data in figures 5 and 6 show a
different pattern over time and across ages and races. Focus on figure 6, the
20

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

white/nonwhite ratio of poliomyelitis mortality rates. Among infants (age
“0” in figure 6), nonwhites tend to have excess mortality. Infancy is the age
at which maternal antibody protection predominates (cf. figure 1). In infancy, we don’t expect the hygiene hypothesis to hold, because not enough
time since birth has elapsed to accumulate inoculating exposures. Infection
at this age can be “vaccine-like” (Zinkernagel, 2002, p.117), setting up permanent lifetime immunity (figure 1), all the more so in the presence of later
exposures to poliovirus, which act as boosters. If water is dirty enough, it can
overwhelm passive maternal-antibody protection, causing frank poliomyelitis, and potentially death. In infancy — and infancy only — we expect those
drinking dirtier water to have higher polio mortality rates; this is what the
data reveal. For polio, 16 of the 28 instances of a ratio of 1.0 (for males) and
13 of 35 (for females) in figure 6, represent zero divided by zero.
Next, consider polio mortality at ages 5 and over (the top four age-group
panels of figure 6). Here we see clear evidence of white excess polio mortality
(ratio below 1.0). Before 1940, the data are somewhat sparse for 35–44 yearolds. These cohorts were born in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, yielding small sample sizes of polio deaths at advanced ages; most
everyone acquired immunity in childhood. Another salient pattern is that
the white excess becomes more profound over time, especially after 1940,
but only up to the mid 1950s. This is a reflection of white cohorts growing up with cleaner water (Troesken, 2004; Cutler and Miller, 2005), and
therefore being susceptible to polio at ages 5 and above. The sudden shift
to nonwhite excess toward the end of the data series is due to unequal access to the vaccine. The double effect of further water quality improvements
and of vaccination results in the sparse data in the 1960s. Since maternal
antibodies do not vanish on the first birthday, the data for ages 1–4 show a
pattern intermediate between infants and the 5–14 age group.
The typhoid data show that nonwhites were not drinking cleaner water. Is it possible that clean water as regards typhoid and polio are two
independent phenomena? Suppose, for the sake of argument, there was
less polio transmission among nonwhites, and that this was maintained by,
say, residential segregation. In this scenario, nonwhites could have lower
mortality rates for polio, while typhoid epidemiology would exist in its own
compartment. Melnick et al. (1955, 1957, 1962), and Le Bouvier (1957)
show that lower socioeconomic status (SES) residents of Phoenix, Arizona
and Charleston, W. Virginia had higher levels of polio antibodies than their
higher SES counterparts. In addition to the mortality data for infants, this is
strong evidence against the hypothetical that there was less polio transmis-

21

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

sion in nonwhite communities. Melnick and Parks (1964) present similar
data for Houston, Texas, but during the early vaccine era, so the data are not
completely comparable.
Nothing in the flow of white and nonwhite births (figures 9 and 10)
would seem to predict the racial differences in polio mortality. The dynamics of infectious diseases — especially those in which there is post-recovery
immunity — are intimately related to birth rates, which provide a flow of
susceptible individuals. Epidemics reduce the stock of susceptibles, which
must then be replenished by new flows, and so on (Anderson and May,
1991). Given that the baby boom began in 1946 (Easterlin 1961, Healy
2018), there is no doubt that it somehow affected polio epidemiology during the “major epidemic years (1949–1954)” (Eiben, 1997, p.108). Given the
general similarity of the white and nonwhite baby booms, it is hard to see
how the births could have governed the divergence of mortality patterns by
race. What is more, “thirty-five percent of [polio] patients admitted... [in
1949–1954] were adults” (ibid.), which is much more consistent with the
hygiene hypothesis.
Viewing the mortality patterns through a cohort lens helps bring them in
into focus (Ryder, 1965; Hobcraft et al., 1982). Fifteen to twenty-four yearolds were born 15–24 years ago, etc. Their polio mortality patterns reflect
current circulation of poliovirus in the water supply, but also their immunity as a cohort. The latter is influenced by poliovius circulation when they
were infants, 15–24 years ago, as well as in the intervening years. Similarly, mutatis mutandis, for other birth cohorts. Before the vaccine, drinking
tap water was a risk factor for polio, except in cases where water filtration
and chlorination worked absolutely perfectly. Cohorts which grew up before
substantial improvements in water quality were overwhelmingly immune to
poliomyelitis as adults. Significant improvements in tap water quality by the
mid-1920s (for whites) — not the baby boom — set the stage for the postwar emergence of paralytic polio as a feared infectious disease. As cohorts
aged, people who grew up with cleaner water became adults susceptible to
polio; for all intents and purposes, this phenomenon did not exist before the
early twentieth century.
Given the close fit of the mortality data to the hygiene hypothesis, we do
not dwell on issues of statistical significance. While we have focused on the
results as differences, ratios, and their graphical presentation, significance is
well-documented in Appendix B. Consider ages 5–14 (table 9, p.36), and the
key decade of 1940–49 — the last complete decade before the vaccine, and
the “cleanest” until that point (measured by typhoid fever death rates). In
22

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

nine of these ten years, and for both sexes, polio death rates were higher for
whites than nonwhites and in one year they were equal. For males, eight of
the nine white-excess years were statistically significant; seven for females.
In the non-significant, non-equal years (one for males and two for females),
whites’ polio mortality still exceeded that of nonwhites. Contrast this with
typhoid fever mortality (again, table 9): it’s almost the perfect inverse, racewise. For typhoid, and looking at the same age group (5–14) and decade
(1940s), nonwhites always have higher mortality (no ties). In eight years
for males (seven for females), the nonwhite typhoid excess mortality is statistically significant. In one year for males (two for females), there was a
nonwhite excess that was not significant, and there was one year per sex
in which significance calculations were not feasible because mortality rates
were zero for whites.

Conclusion
Consider again figure 1, the Casablanca antibody data of Paul and Horstmann
(1955), from a time in Morocco when there was no paralytic polio except in
the French expatriate community. These are cross-sectional data, but come
from the period of stable equilibrium prior to the emergence of poliomyelitis in Morocco. Thus, the antibody profile by age can be considered to be a
cohort (or individual) profile as well. Babies are born with protective maternal antibodies. This reflects the fact that their mothers experienced asymptomatic polio infection and were constantly boosted by exposure to the poliovirus. During infancy, at varying rates, these maternal antibodies fade. In
the omnipresence of poliovirus, when maternal antibodies have declined to
the point at which they provide only partial protection, it sets the stage for
asymptomatic polio infection, thus generating lifelong protective immunity.
Maternal antibody immunity is passive, while immunity from asymptomatic
infection is adaptive (i.e., active). If this does not occur in infancy, it happens in early childhood. This generates the steeply declining — and then
steeply increasing — prevalence of neutralizing antibody by age, followed
by consistently high levels at older ages (figure 1).
Consider again the polio hygiene sub-hypotheses (p.6):
1. [Non-infant polio death rates increase, until 1955.] The data support
this.
2. [Polio mortality increases greater above age 5.] The data support this.
23

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

3. [ Nonwhites:]
(a) [ increase less than whites] The data support this.
(b) [ except during infancy] The data support this.
(c) [ decline with IPV ] The data only partly support this, as it appears that
nonwhites had less access to the vaccine.
4. [ patterns similar by sex ] The data support this.
In short, the racially cross-classified polio mortality data conform well to the
hygiene hypothesis. Martinez-Bakker et al. (2015) write: “We also show
that the historical emergence of epidemic polio was largely a consequence of
demographic trends rather than improvements in hygiene” (p.17). We find
that racial trends in poliomyelitis mortality in the United States are at odds
with that conclusion.
From Polio’s emergence as an epidemic disease in the northeast in 1916,
through the vaccine era that began in 1955, and until its de facto elimination
in the 1980s (Strebel et al., 1992), polio’s epidemiology in the United States
was consistent with the hygiene hypothesis. Internationally, the country-bycountry emergence of paralytic polio throughout the twentieth century also
reflected the global dimensions of the hygiene hypothesis: “Within the last
decade or so, many countries have experienced relatively serious outbreaks
of poliomyelitis for the first time” (Payne, 1955, p.393).
Changes in polio transmission resulted in an increase in the average age
of acquisition, which in turn drove changes in polio epidemiology throughout the twentieth century. In this paper, we documented the twentiethcentury evolution of polio mortality by sex, race and age; these patterns are
best explained by the hygiene hypothesis. The birth-rate hypothesis does
not include race and therefore does not account for the observed patterns.
Typhoid mortality data, on the other hand, permit racially-specific versions
of the hygiene hypothesis.
Rising polio mortality in the postwar era captured the imagination because it occurred even as life expectancy was growing (Berin et al., 1989)
and infectious disease case fatality rates were falling, with much attribution
of this to penicillin (f.e. Burnet, 1951). Mortality improvements occurred
even with non-bacterial diseases such as measles (Gindler et al., 2004). With
poliomyelitis, relief had to wait for the IPV vaccine in 1955. The racial mortality data show that this resulted in a racial flip-flop, with polio becoming a
nonwhite-excess killer. While the pivotal postwar period in polio coincided

24

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

with the baby boom, our racially-stratified analysis confirms that the hygiene hypothesis is alive and well. Or: throw out the baby boom in favor of
the bathwater.

Appendix B: Descriptive statistics and tests
Tables 1–6 (pp.28–33) give all-years and decadal arithmetic and geometric
means (Schoen, 1970) of polio and typhoid death rates, broken down by age
(one table per age-panel of figures 3 and 5). The figures have some gaps,
and the N-missing and N-zero rows of the tables clarify the origins of these.
Zero values appear as gaps because figures 3 and 5 have logarithmic scale,
and therefore cannot plot zeros, whereas missing values are simply missing.
For both causes and all demographic groups, 1910–13 and 1917, are missing,
so N-missing is five for the decade 1910–19 and for the total time span. All
other gaps in the figures are caused by zero values. Where there are a large
number of zero values, the two means (geometric and arithmetic) diverge,
since zeros must be excluded from the calculation of geometric means.
Tables 7–12 (pp.34–39) summarize tests of statistical significance of white
vs. non-white death rates (by age groups, sex, and disease). An example of
how to read these tables is as follows. In table 7 (p.34), the upper-right
corner of the table summarizes the comparisons for polio, for males. The
values, are 3, 6; and then (next row) 9, 28; and then (next row) 6, 0; and
then 0, 3. The first row indicates that there are 3 years in which white males
have statistically-significantly higher death rates than nonwhite males, and
6 years in which nonwhite males were higher (and statistically significant).
The next row indicates there were 9 years in which whites were higher but
not statistically significant, and 28 years in which nonwhites were higher
but not statistically significant. The next row indicates that there were 6
years in which whites were higher by virtue of nonwhites having a recorded
death rate of zero, and no years in which nonwhites were higher because
whites had a death rate of zero. The next row shows that there were no
years in which whites and nonwhites had equal (and nonzero) death rates,
but 3 years in which whites and nonwhites had equal death rates because
both were zero. This concludes the comparisons for polio for males. The next
block is for polio, for females (1, 2 then 12, 31, then 7, 0, then 0, 2), and so
on. The same comparisons, disaggregated by decade, are shown in the lower
blocks of rows. Table 7 (p.34) is for infants; subsequent tables are for other
age groups.
Throughout, statistical significance is defined using a 95% uncertainty
interval approach. The white and nonwhite rates are significantly different if and only if the white point estimate lies outside the 95% UI for the
nonwhite
estimate and vice versa. The 95% UIs were constructed using (D ±
√
1.96 D)/K, in which D is the number of deaths in a given cell, and K is
26

Paper for PAA annual meeting, Austin, Texas, April 2019

the exposure (person-years at risk) in that cell (the point estimate is D/K).
This is based on the Poisson variance of death counts (Brillinger, 1986; Andreasen and Simonsen, 2011). Lack of significance often reflects the small
counts of polio and typhoid deaths in later years.

Appendix C: Racial comparisons for other diseases
To illustrate how unusual it is to see a nonwhite excess in infectious disease
mortality — as in figure 6, for poliomyelitis — figure 11 (overleaf) shows
white/nonwhite comparisons for a battery of other infectious diseases. Because twelve diseases are compared in one graph, age groups are collapsed
using the age-adjusted death rate. Polio and typhoid are shown for comparison (these two diseases are repeated from figures 4 and 6). None of the
earlier graphs show the age-adjusted death rate — only the component (agespecific) death rates, and only up to age 45. The ten other infectious diseases
are: dysentery; meningococcal infections; GCDE (gastritis, colitis, duodenitis, and enteritis); TB (tuberculosis, all forms); pertussis; measles; diphtheria; PI (pneumonia and influenza); RF (rheumatic fever), and syphilis. The
data come from U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (1956),
and this figure includes all infectious diseases in that source. The typhoid
series ends in 1948 because the white age-adjusted death rate is zero in all
later data, meaning the ratio cannot be calculated.
All diseases in figure 11 follow the typhoid pattern of nonwhite excess,
not the polio pattern — except meningococcal disease, measles, and diphtheria. None of these three share polio’s pattern of declining ratio during
the 1940s and early 1950s. Meningococcal infections and measles show a lot
of noise around the line of equality, and moreover from 1935 onward show
nonwhite excess for the preponderance of years. Diphtheria, on the other
hand, trends clearly toward greater and greater nonwhite excess after 1940.
The point here is that the polio pattern by race is unlike that of any other infectious disease, even those which are exceptions to the rule that nonwhite
death rates always exceeds that of whites.

Appendix D: Heatmaps
These two figures present the same data as figures 3 and 5, but as age×time
heatmaps. These do not permit white:nonwhite comparisons on the same
axes, as figures 3 and 5 do, but have the advantage of not segregating the
age groups into discrete panels. These heatmaps show clearly that typhoid
death rates decline continuously throughout the period, while polio death
rates rise for whites in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly at older age groups.
The color scale is inverse hyperbolic sign-transformed, resulting in no missing values for zeros; data for 1917 are missing in the original source. The
maximum values for polio occurred in 1916, associated with the huge epidemic in the northeast (Nicoll, 1917; Lavinder et al., 1918). Heatmaps for
both diseases are constructed using the same maximal possible value: 83.6
per 100,000 (corresponding to polio in 1916, for white male infants). The
maximum observed value for typhoid is lower, 59.6/100,000 (for 1918, nonwhite males).
