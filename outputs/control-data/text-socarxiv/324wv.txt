1. Introduction: Jobs, Occupations, and Social Class in the GSS
Beginning with the 2012 General Social Survey, job titles and job activity descriptions
have been coded using only the 539-category 2010 US Census occupational classification
(hereafter, “2010 census occupation codes”). As of July 2016, most job titles and descriptions
from prior administrations of the GSS were also recoded to the 2010 census occupation codes.1
A reasonable expectation is that the 2010 census occupation codes will continue to be used for
the GSS at least until 2022.
1.1. Prestige Ratings and SEI Scores
The 2010 census occupation codes can be used in many ways to model individual
variation in other outcomes measured for the GSS. With the updated prestige ratings also
developed during the fielding of the 2012 GSS (see Smith and Son 2014), two possibilities are to
use either the new prestige scale (prestig10) or its associated SEI scale (sei10). These scales are
now available for all individuals with 2010 census occupation codes, and their construction is
explained in Hout, Smith, and Marsden (2016). For analysts who want a unidimensional scale
of occupational standing, the SEI scores for the occupations are a very good choice.2
1.2. A Coding of Social Class
For analysts who wish to have a measure of social class, any principled coding of the
2010 occupation codes can be used to group related occupations into larger agglomerations,
perhaps using additional information on individuals drawn from work histories and current
labor market status. In the remainder of this report, I share the results of one such coding effort
that I undertook in preparation for analysis of the 2016 GSS, during a time when conjectures
about class-specific political attitudes and voting trends had received renewed attention in the
United States.

As of its summer 2016 release, the GSS cumulative data file includes multiple occupation codes for all
years until and including 2010. The variable occ is present from 1972 through 1990 and is based on the
1970 census occupations codes. The variable occ80 is present from 1988 through 2010 and is based on
1980 census occupations codes. However, from 2012 onward, only the 2010 codes are used for the new
variable occ10.
2 As described in Hout et al. (2016), the values of the scale are near equal averages of threshold scales for
educational attainment and personal earnings from a national sample of occupational incumbents,
calculated using the public use microdata files of the American Community Survey (ACS). The near
equal weighting of the scales for education and earnings for each occupation is justified by an analysis of
the prestige ratings from GSS respondents’ assessments of hundreds of job titles (see Smith and Son
2014). These ratings proved once again to be consistent with a long tradition of measurement of
occupational prestige, and thus the variable sei10 is a direct analog to past SEI variables in the GSS (i.e.,
the sei variable available for 1988 through 2010).
1

The specific social class coding explained in this report is available as a .csv file, occ10to-egp-class-crosswalk.csv, that is posted on the GSS website and my own personal website.
The coding is also shown below in tabular form, as implemented for the 1994 GSS through 2016
GSS in Appendix Tables A1, A2, and A3 (beginning below on page 41).
Because this coding represents only one coding for how social class categories can be
formed, it is not included as an official variable in any of the GSS data files. However, it can be
matched to all GSS respondents who have valid codes for the variable occ10, as I demonstrate
below with sample Stata code. The social class coding can also be used with minor
modifications in any other data source that has occupation codes traceable to the 2010 Standard
Occupational Classification of the United States, since this classification is the guiding
framework for all occupational coding decisions in the United States since 2010.

2. The Rationale and Strategy for Coding Social Class
2.1. The Original EGP Class Schema
Although many social class categorizations exist, I chose to code occupations to what I
regard as the dominant schema in the international sociological literature on class differences. I
will refer to this coding as the EGP class schema, which was debuted by Erikson, Goldthorpe,
Portocarero (1979, 1982, 1983) but is also sometimes referred to as Goldthorpe’s class schema
(after Goldthorpe 1987) or the EG class schema (after Erikson and Goldthorpe 1992). Its most
prominent usage was in The Constant Flux, a broadly influential 1992 cross-national study of
social mobility by Erikson and Goldthorpe.
Erikson and Goldthorpe (1992:41-42) describe each of their EGP classes in this way:
Class I
Higher-grade professionals, administrators, and officials; managers in large
industrial establishments; large proprietors
Class II
Lower-grade professionals, administrators, and officials; higher-grade technicians;
managers in small industrial establishments; supervisors of non-manual employees
Class IIIa
Routine non-manual employees, higher-grade (administration and commerce)
Class IIIb
Routine non-manual employees, lower-grade (sales and service)
Class IVa
Small proprietors, artisans, etc., with employees
Class IVb
Small proprietors, artisans, etc., without employees
Class IVc
Farmers and small-holders; other self-employed workers in primary production
Class V
Lower-grade technicians; supervisors of manual workers
Class VI
Skilled manual workers
Class VIIa
Semi- and unskilled manual workers (not in agriculture)
Class VIIb
Agricultural and other workers in primary production

As explained by Erikson and Goldthorpe, classes I, II, IIIa, and IIIb represent nonmanual workers, sorted in a principled hierarchy. Classes V, VI, and VIIa represent manual
workers, also sorted in a principled hierarchy. Classes IVa and IVb represent self-employed
workers, not in classes I and II and not in agriculture or primary production. These workers are
sometimes discussed by Erikson and Goldthorpe as representing the classic “petty
bourgeoisie,” with class IVa differing from class IVb based on the scale of the self-employed

3

worker’s enterprise (and measured, when possible, by whether the individual has employees
and, if so, how many). Class IVc represents farmers and others in primary production, usually
self-employed, and class VIIb represents unskilled agricultural laborers and other similar
workers, often those who are employed by members of class IVc. In studies of labor market
outcomes, classes IVa, IVb, IVc, and VIIb are often dropped from analysis because of the
divergent nature of their remuneration and work contexts.
Incumbents of classes I and II have employment contracts that typically have what is
referred to in this tradition of analysis as a salary structure (and hence, classes I and II, are often
labeled as composing the “salariat”). These individuals have skills that can be very specific to
their occupations, and the monitoring of their daily performance by supervisors is difficult.
They are therefore contracted as salaried employees, and their hourly and daily performance is
not regularly monitored. In contrast, classes IIIb, VI, VIIa, and VIIb have employment contracts
that approach, to varying degrees, a classic “spot contract,” even if for transaction cost reasons
or regulatory reasons they may not be paid on a piece rate or an hourly basis. Workers in these
classes have skills that are less specific to their occupations, and their performance could be
monitored daily, or even hourly, by supervisors, even if in practice this is not the case. Classes
IIIa and V have employment contracts that are “mixed,” with occupation and worker-specific
variation, and with employment contracts with some blending of the features of both the salary
and spot contract structures.
2.2. Why Code to EGP?
Although I embrace the core rationale of the EGP class schema, others eschew it. The
primary reasons that I regard EGP classes as valuable and worthy of usage are
1. EGP is not unidimensional, even though hierarchy is embedded within it. For
example, while class I exceeds class II on many indicators, no clear ranking exists for
other classes, such as for classes V or VI relative to class IIIa, or for class IIIb relative
to class VIIa. As such, EGP is a complementary categorization to unidimensional
orderings. It can be used alongside other scales of occupations, such as those based
on prestige ratings or simply the average education or earnings of occupational
incumbents.
2. EGP has a tractable number of class categories, and it can be collapsed further (e.g.,
by combining classes I and II, classes V and VI, and classes IIIb and VIIa). This
flexibility allows for parsimonious modeling, crisp characterizations, and continued
usage in data sources that are of modest size (as is the case for each GSS crosssection).
3. EGP can represent the evolving post-industrial occupational structure. For example,
the pattern of growth of differentially skilled “service sector” occupations is
captured by the relative growth of classes I, II, and IIIa. The “working class” is

4

usefully separated into a service-oriented class, IIIb, as well as two manual classes
differing in typically required skills, classes VI and VIIa. In addition, the differences
between these classes, as shown below, reveal the underlying sex segregation of
occupations that are differentially distributed across classes.
These reasons notwithstanding, principled reasons exist to avoid the EGP class schema. The
reasonable arguments of others are
1. Some researchers prefer class categories defined in opposition to each other. Class
differences can then be characterized as the result of between-class contestation,
usually resulting in asymmetrical exploitation. From this perspective, reliance on
classes that represent agglomerations of occupational titles defined by government
bureaucrats is a profane form of social science. For this argument, see Wright (1997).
2. Some researchers prefer class schemas with a larger number of categories (typically
about 100, and often labeled “microclasses”). These more elaborate categorizations
facilitate fine-grained analysis of job inheritance and the consequences of the values,
cultures, and local institutions that are tightly bundled with some occupations, or
small agglomerations thereof. For this argument, see Grusky and Sørensen (1998)
and Weeden and Grusky (2005).
3. Some researchers prefer class categories, if any at all, to be based on patterns of
consumption or post-materialist values, rather than the vestiges of working
conditions that were characteristic of the mid-twentieth century industrial order.
When class categories are organized primarily by market position and the
acquisition of resources, they are claimed to be insufficiently predictive of behavior
in the post-industrial age. For this argument, see Kingston (2000) and Pakulski and
Waters (1996).
4. Some researchers (e.g., perhaps most labor economists) see little utility in the usage
of class categorizations and argue instead for direct attention to individuals’ “premarket” characteristics (e.g., years of completed education) and current labor market
outcomes (e.g., wages earned). From this perspective, measures of social class are of
relatively minor importance, even though effects attributable to particular
occupations may be worthy of examination (e.g., to consider whether occupational
licenses have meaningful effects above and beyond what can be predicted from
individual-level measures).
2.3. Orienting Decisions for the Coding Strategy
My goal was to create a coding for occupations that would yield social classes in the
spirit of the original EGP class schema, with full recognition that the distribution of job titles
evolves yearly and that the original EGP class schema was a product of its foundational time

5

period (the late 1970s through the early 1990s).3 Accordingly, several crucial decisions had to be
taken at the outset.
First, I decided to code the 478 occupations that compose the 2012 occupational
classification of the American Community Survey (hereafter, “ACS occupation codes”), which is
expected to be used by the US Census Bureau for the ACS through 2020. All 539 census
occupation codes that the GSS used for its own coding are embedded uniquely within each of
the 478 categories of the ACS occupational classification. Thus, even though I coded the 478
occupations, the codes still allocate all 539 census occupations used for the GSS. I decided to
code in this way because very little information from external sources on occupational
incumbents is available to aid in coding the additional 2010 census occupations (i.e., the 479th
through 539th occupations), given that the ACS replaced the US Census long form. I therefore
had too little information to code the additional occupations with the same degree of care. In
addition, coding the 478 occupations seemed forward-oriented, given the likelihood that many
of the additional census occupations are small and thus candidates for being folded into larger
categories in future occupational coding schemes promulgated by the US federal statistical
agencies that collect occupation-related data.4
Unfortunately, this decision requires working with some awkward and clearly internally
heterogeneous occupations in some cases (and which mistakenly imply, because of their labels,
that the “folded in” occupation is as common as the larger “receiving” occupation). For
example, the two census occupations of “Chief Executives” and “Legislators” are combined for
the ACS as “Chief Executives and Legislators.” It is not obvious to anyone that the job titles
beneath “Chief Executives” and “Legislators” belong together in an occupational group.
However, very little information is collected separately for legislators, either for prior microdata
released to the public by the US Census Bureau or for the auxiliary ONET information
described below that I used for coding. In other cases, the groupings are entirely reasonable,
such as the combination of “Food preparation and serving related workers, all other” with
“Dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers” which are combined for the
omnibus ACS category of “Miscellaneous food preparation and serving related workers,
including dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers.” The occupational label
is ungainly, but a consideration of the job titles listed in the SOC direct match file (described
below) indicates that combinations such as these are sensible.
Second, I did not attempt to make the new EGP class coding of the ACS occupations
consistent on an occupation-by-occupation basis with any prior efforts to code EGP classes
using 1980 and 1990 US census occupation codes, including my own past work (e.g., see the
Supplementary Appendices to Morgan and McKerrow 2004 and Morgan and Tang 2007). After
In addition, Erikson and Goldthorpe indicated that their initial attempts to code the EGP class schema
for the United States were unsuccessful (see Erikson and Goldthorpe 1985). There is, therefore, no urtext
of the EGP class schema for the United States, only subsequent efforts.
4 As Table A1 (below) shows for the GSS, these additional occupations are indeed very small in
comparison to the 478 ACS occupations.
3

6

initial exploration, I came to the position that the shift in census occupation codes that was
debuted for 2000 (and carried forward to 2010) created very substantial inconsistency across
occupations that seem similar based on their occupation labels (and this is consistent with a
study conducted by the US Census Bureau; see Scopp 2003).5 Only for deeply institutionalized
occupations was I confident that the occupation labels mapped to clearly defined and stable
collections of underlying job titles. I decided to code the EGP classes without attempting to
create similarities with prior coding decisions, even though, of course, a great many
equivalences did emerge.
Third, I decided to code occupations into EGP classes in a first step that would ignore
classes IVa and IVb. Although these two classes were sometimes labeled the “petty
bourgeoisie” in early work with the EGP, they have come to be recognized in most subsequent
empirical work in less grand terms: the self-employed members of occupations associated with
classes IIIa, IIIb, V, VI, and VIIa. A final coding, which moves incumbents of the occupations
allocated to classes IIIa, IIIb, V, VI, and VIIa into classes IVa and IVb can be implemented using
self-employment variables in the GSS.6
Fourth, I decided that the four heterogeneous military occupations would be categorized
separately as their own EGP “class.” These are “Military officer special and tactical operations
leaders,” “First-line enlisted military supervisors,” “Military enlisted tactical operations and
air/weapons specialists and crew members, and “Military, rank not specified.” For a large array
of outcomes of interest, it is sensible to separate members of the military from the civilian labor
force, even though the military “class” includes substantial heterogeneity of job duties,
educational training, and work experiences.
2.4. A Coding Strategy Based Only on the ACS, SOC, and ONET
To inform coding decisions for the 478 ACS occupations, I assembled occupationspecific information from three primary sources:
1. The 2012-2015 public use microsamples of the ACS, which include individual-level
data on the demographic characteristics, education, labor force status, and earnings
of millions of occupational incumbents spread across all 478 occupations
2. Documentation for the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (hereafter, “SOC”),
including the textual SOC Definitions, which are paragraph descriptions of
associated job duties, as well as the Direct Match Title File that associates job titles
with each SOC occupation)
I thank Minhyoung Kang for his research assistance in the initial coding, which was crucial in the way
that it informed this later decision.
6 If measures are available to determine whether self-employed workers have their own employees, and
how many, these measures can be used to separate a combined class IVab into classes IVa and IVb. For
the GSS, this separation is possible for 2004 onward.

3. The ONET 21.0 Database, which can be matched to most SOC occupations, and
which includes occupational ratings generated on a recurring survey of human
resources professionals
Notice that the GSS itself is not listed above. The GSS data were not used to develop the coding
of social class because the yearly samples are too small to yield reliable measures of the
incumbents of all 478 occupations.
Aided by appropriate crosswalks that summarized the nesting of jobs and occupations,
it was possible to construct a single file for all 478 occupations with information appropriately
calculated from these sources (except the textual SOC definitions). In nearly all cases, some
compromises were made in the construction of this file, such as when calculating averages
across jobs/occupations to collapse the SOC-based ONET information to the ACS occupations
(which, ultimately, was possible for only 463 of the 478 occupations).
With these sources of information in hand, I coded the occupations iteratively using my
own judgment. In many cases, my initial decisions were superseded by new decisions after
careful consideration of the ACS information on occupational incumbents, the SOC definitions
and associated job titles contained in the SOC direct match job title file, the ONET information
on the ratings of occupations, and the overall “employment relations” rationale of the EGP. I
stopped coding when I was convinced that I could not improve the categorization any further
without making decisions that were no better than prior decisions.
Although many of my decisions are consistent with EGP coding decisions based on 1980
and 1990 US census codes, some occupation-by-occupation comparisons of occupation labels
will suggest differences. Some of these apparent differences reflect the SOC itself, which is
substantially more detailed for many types of white-collar work. Many inconsistencies reflect
better decisions enacted for this coding, in my view, that result from (1) improvements in the
US Census Bureau’s rules for assigning job titles and activities to occupations, as guided by the
rationale underneath the SOC and (2) the new information available in the ONET and ACS that
can be used to code resulting occupations into classes.7
See Scopp (2003; Table 2) for the results of a double-coding exercise that demonstrates the consequences
of new coding rules for job titles and job activities first implemented for the 2000 US census. These new
rules generated many differences in the underlying jobs associated with seemingly similar occupations.
For this reason alone, some reallocation of occupations would be expected for any comparison of EGP
classes based on 1980/1990 US census codes to EGP classes based on 2000/2010 US census codes. My
sense is that the 2000/2010 coding rules are far better, both as occupation codes themselves and as can be
used for the coding of EGP, especially for occupations that are clearly overbroad. Two examples are
helpful:
1. The 1990 occupation 37, “Management related occupations, n.e.c.,” was placed in class I for
Morgan and Tang (2007) based on the EGP literature on the placement of managers. With the 2000
census occupations codes, as shown by Scopp (2003, Table 2), this group would be divided into five
7

8

Regardless of comparisons to prior instantiations of the EGP class schema, some
decisions will appear puzzling on their own, based only on consulting the occupation labels in
Tables A1-A3 (and the associated .csv file). To some extent, such reactions are appropriate,
since the fullness of a 478-part occupational categorization cannot be preserved for a coding of a
dozen or fewer EGP classes. Small but distinct occupations, such as “Actors,” “Animal
Trainers,” and “Athletes, Coaches, Umpires, and Related Workers,” need to be placed
somewhere.
In addition, many of the occupations are agglomerations of job titles that are not well
described by their associated occupation labels. For example, the occupation “Other Teachers
and Instructors” makes little sense on its own without a full consideration of the available
information. The ACS revealed that the 2012 through 2015 incumbents of “Other Teachers and
Instructors” had, on average, 15.2 years of education and personal earnings each year of
$31,700. When restricted to full-time, full-year workers, these incumbents had 15.1 years of
education and $51,500 in personal earnings. What these incumbents did in their jobs only
became clear when the underlying job titles in the SOC direct match title file was consulted.
The file offers illustrative job titles as “Tutor, Horseback Riding Instructor, Citizenship Teacher,
Adult Education Teacher, Adult Literacy Instructor, General Educational Development (GED)
Teacher, Substitute Teacher, and Sailing Instructor.” It also lists additional non-illustrative job
titles as “Ballet Teacher, Judo Instructor, Dance Teacher, Defensive Driving Instructor, CPR
Instructor, Driver Education Instructor, Adult Basic Studies Teacher, Adult Remedial Education
Instructor, Martial Arts Instructor, and Theater Education Teacher.” After considering the full
set of information available, I decided to place this occupation in class IIIa, rather than class I
(where postsecondary teachers are placed) or class II (where elementary, middle, and secondary
school teachers are placed). This decision is a good example of a tough coding choice, and in
occupations for the 2000 occupation codes: Cost estimators (21.6%), Meeting and convention planners
(0.7%), Other business operations specialists (45.3%), First-line supervisors of office and administrative
support workers (6.5%), and Secretaries and administrative assistants (25.9%). For the new EGP coding
described in this report, these five occupations are allocated across three separate classes (as “Business
Operations Specialists, All Other” in class II, “Meeting, Convention, and Event Planners” in class IIIa,
“Secretaries and Administrative Assistants” in class IIIa, “First-Line Supervisors of Office And
Administrative Support Workers” in class IIIa, and “Cost Estimators” in class V.)
2. The 1990 occupation 5, “Administrators and officials, public administration,” was placed in class I
for Morgan and Tang (2007), based on the EGP literature on the placement of officials in large
establishments. With the 2000 census occupation codes, as shown by Scopp (2003, Table 2), this same
group of jobs would be allocated across 29 separate occupations, typically spread across both classes I
and II. On the one hand, the largest of these 29 occupations is the 2000 census occupation of “Managers,
All Other,” which is folded into the 2012 ACS category of “Miscellaneous Managers, Including Funeral
Service Managers and Postmasters and Mail Superintendents” (code 430, and where it is reasonable to
assume “Miscellaneous Managers” dominate). This occupation is placed in the new EGP coding in
class II, based on the criteria laid out in this report. On the other hand, the 29 occupations include some
– such as “Chief Executives,” “Financial Analysts,” and “Judges, Magistrates, and Other Judicial
Workers ” – that are placed in the new EGP coding in class I.

9

fact it was the final coding decision that I made. Class II might have been more appropriate if
the average education and earnings of incumbents, as well as the ONET job zone rating, had
been higher. In the end, I decided, based on the ACS results, that many individuals in this
occupation had the profile of tutors and horseback riding instructors without bachelor’s
degrees, rather than secondary school teachers with bachelor’s degrees who were temporarily
employed as substitute teachers.

3. The New Coding of Occupations
The original EGP class schema was developed during the twilight of the post-WorldWar-II industrial economy and while the information technology fueled post-industrial
economy was in formation. The goal of my coding effort was to realize the benefits of the core
rationale of the original EGP coding in a new coding appropriate for the analysis of today’s
stratification order (and a coding that can be used, with all due care, to reach back and analyze
GSS data collected as early as 1972). I did not strive to replicate the fine features of the original
EGP class schema, which was based on the occupational structure that prevailed several
decades ago. Even if this were my goal, it would be impossible to succeed because of
mismatches, detailed in the last section, in how jobs are assigned to the evolving structure of
occupations from the year 2000 onward.
Having completed the coding, it is possible to now ask the question: Is this new coding
still properly referred to as EGP? The ultimate answer is in the eye of the beholder. My
position is that this coding is EGP for our time, tailored to the labor market of the United States.
Before presenting the characteristics of the classes generated by this coding, in the next
section I consider classes IIIa and V. These are the classes where it could be argued that I have
introduced some implicit but modest updating for this EGP coding in comparison to its
predecessors. It is notable, however, that these are the classes that Goldthorpe and his
colleagues have long recognized have “mixed” types of employment contracts. It is here,
therefore, that one might expect change to emerge more prominently. And, if so, no updating
has occurred in my construction of the schema, and these classes only appear slightly updated
because of underlying shifts in the division of labor, and its contracting, in the post-industrial
United States.
3.1. Classes IIIa and V: A Natural Evolution of the Original EGP Classes?
For this coding, some occupations that the extant EGP literature suggests could be
placed in class II were instead allocated to class IIIa or class V based on their characteristics,
seen in light of the structure of the current division of labor. The occupational structure has
evolved in the last three decades with substantial skill upgrading for many occupations, along
with a blurring of the boundaries in the employment relations between occupations at the lower
end of what Erikson and Goldthorpe labeled the “salariat” (i.e., classes I and II) and those at the
higher-end of class IIIa, which they labeled “routine non-manual employees, higher-grade
(administration and commerce).” The occupation of “Human Resource Workers” is a good
example of a class IIIa occupation that ranks lower on all dimensions than the class II
occupation of “Human Resource Managers,” but not so much lower that the traditional EGP
label of “routine non-manual employee” feels quite right anymore. Accordingly, the common
practice, when analyzing datasets of modest size, of combining the original EGP classes I and II
into a salariat class and classes IIIa and IIIb into a routine non-manual service class seems less

11

appropriate for this new coding. Classes I, II, IIIa, and IIIb appear in the new coding in a clear
ordering, with a break between II and IIIa a bit less apparent now than in the past.
Relatedly, class V in the new coding is even more heterogeneous than users of past
versions of EGP might expect. This result, however, is consistent with past analysis practices, in
which class V is treated as being the most heterogeneous in its associated employment relations.
From this perspective, class V has always been a “middling” class for occupations that confer
advantages on incumbents relative to those in classes IIIb, VI, and VIIa, are more physical or
technical than many of the cubicle-based occupations typical of class IIIa, and that clearly do not
fit within classes I or II because of either lower levels of education or earnings (and whose
inclusion in classes I or II would compromise the boundaries of classes I and II). Public safety
workers (police officers and firefighters) are a prime example. More awkward are the small, but
hard to categorize, occupations for performers (“Actors” and “Announcers,” etc.) whose
positions, when measured objectively by their incumbents’ characteristics, and ONET ratings,
are not as high-minded as one might otherwise assume from lay portrayals.

4. Characteristics of the New EGP Classes
Important Note of Clarification
In this section, and subsequent sections, I present characteristics of three related EGP
class categorizations.
The 10-class version of EGP considered first does not include classes IVa or IVb. It is
based only on the coding of the 478 occupations in the ACS occupational categorization. In other
words, self-employed individuals in classes IIIa, IIIb, V, VI, and VIIa have not been reallocated to
classes IVa and IVb, and for this reason I often use the phrase “occupation only” EGP classes
when referring to the 10-class version.
When information on self-employment is utilized (either for the ACS or the GSS), two
additional EGP class categorizations can be formed: an 11-class version of EGP with one
additional class (IVab) and a 12-class version with two additional classes (IVa and IVb as separate
classes).
Because coding decisions were shaped most importantly by decisions for how to allocate
the 478 occupations to classes I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVc, V, VI, VIIa, VIIb, and “Military,” this section
considers the 10-class version of EGP in considerable detail. The 11-class and 12-class versions
are introduced later in this section, and analyzed in less detail.

4.1. Characteristics of the Classes, Based on the ACS and ONET
Table 1 presents class-specific means of the characteristics of occupational incumbents in
the 2012-15 ACS. It also includes class-specific means of the GSS prestige and SEI values (see
Hout et al. 2016) when attached to these ACS individuals. Table 2 presents class-specific means
of the ONET scales that were used for coding. Although the ACS and ONET information
presented in Tables 1 and 2 is reported at the EGP class level, when utilized for coding decisions
it was consulted as occupation-specific means in the case of the ACS and as occupation-specific
ratings in the case of the ONET (where these occupation-specific ratings were often averages of
underlying ratings of more detailed SOC occupations).
Many of the coding decisions for each occupation were very close, and the information
summarized in Tables 1 and 2 was used to adjudicate the close calls. The ONET was used less
frequently than the ACS information, but it proved useful in many cases. As can be seen in
Table 2, the coding resulted in ONET “service importance” and “service level” ratings that
differentiate the service-oriented classes IIIa and IIIb from the manual classes VI, VIIa, and VIIb.
Similarly, to help with close calls when differentiating occupations in classes I, II, and V from
classes IIIa, IIIb, VI, VIIa, and VIIb, the ONET “decision freedom” and “unstructured work”
ratings were utilized. And, as shown in Table 2, little difference is shown on the means for
these ONET ratings between classes IIIa, IIIb, VI, and VIIa because all of the occupations in
these classes are often similarly routine and structured.

Notes: The 2012-15 ACS sample was restricted to respondents aged 25 to 64 not living in institutionalized group
quarters. Across years, dollar values are inflation adjusted to 2015 dollars. “Full-time, full-year workers” are defined
as (1) having worked at least 50 weeks, including vacation days, in the prior 12 months, (2) having usually worked 35
or more hours per week in the prior 12 months, and (3) having reported earnings of at least $10,440 (in 2015 dollars)
from the prior 12 months. The 2012-2015 ACS includes 3,429,382 individuals between the ages of 25 and 64 meeting
this definition of full-time, full-year workers. When weighted, these individuals represent an average yearly adult
full-time, full-year labor force of 90,263,709 individuals between the ages of 25 and 64. “All workers” are defined as
all individuals with a valid occupation code, and occupation codes are not assigned to individuals who have never
worked or who have not worked within the past five years. The 2012-2015 ACS includes 5,495,714 total sampled
individuals of this type (and, when weighted, these individuals represent an average yearly adult worker labor force
of 142,581,005 individuals between the ages of 25 and 64).

Notes: Job Zone is a five-category scale for required preparation for the job, combining educational training, related
experience, and on-the-job training, with 1 “Little or no preparation needed” to 5 “Extensive preparation needed.”
Service Orientation (Level and Importance) are indicators for the skills scale based on the analyst survey. The intent
of the scale appears to be capture the orientation toward assisting people while on the job, rather than working with
materials. Decision Freedom and Unstructured Work are indicators for the work context scale based on the analyst
survey, from 1 “No Freedom” to 5 “A lot of Freedom.”

Table 3 presents additional ACS information on occupational incumbents, and this
information was not considered when developing the coding. It was calculated afterwards, and
I present the class differences because they demonstrate that other characteristics of
occupational incumbents are associated with the EGP distinctions, even though they were not
the basis of the coding. Most prominent, perhaps, is the sex segregation of the occupations
summarized at the class level by the differences in percent female. In particular, classes II, IIIa,
and IIIb are majority female, while all other classes are majority male.

The 98 minor SOC groups are embedded in the 23 major SOC groups. EGP classes do not map
directly to either of these categorizations, with nearly all SOC “major” and “minor” categories
distributed across more than one EGP class, even though the number of EGP classes is much
smaller.
Table 4 presents R-squared values for many different regression specifications for the
prediction of the log earnings and years of completed education of ACS respondents, aged 2564 who have valid occupation codes. The R-squared values are interpretable as the proportion
of the variance of the outcome variable listed in column label that be accounted for by the
specification described in the row label. Each set of regression equations was estimated for two
different samples of the ACS, and variables were typically given factor specifications (i.e., 9 or
10 indicator variables for the 10 or 11 EGP classes, and 10 indicator variables for the 11 groups
of completed education).

Overall, the EGP categorization performs as expected, given how the coding decisions
were made. Comparing Models 1A and 1B to Model 2, indicator variables for the 10-category
and 11-category versions of EGP predict substantially more of each outcome variable than the
23-category SOC major groups. Comparing Models 1A and 1B to Model 6, EGP also predicts
log earnings more strongly than the 11 groups defined by completed years of education.
Comparing Model 1A and 1B to Model 4, EGP always predicts less of the variance than the 98category SOC minor groups, and more so for log earnings than for years of education. But EGP
still fares well, especially with recognition of the fact that it has only 10 or 11 categories rather
than 98 categories. Finally, comparisons within the five triples of models (e.g., Models 2, 3A,
and 3B) show the incremental prediction gain from adding EGP to the variables for the first
model in each triple. In all five cases, EGP classes deliver meaningful additional predictive
variance.
Nonetheless, it should be kept in mind that the coding decisions themselves were made
based to a substantial extent on the dependent variables in these models. Accordingly, it would
be odd indeed if EGP did not effectively predict both log earnings and education. That EGP
does better than the 23 major SOC groups, and is not too far from the 98 minor SOC groups, is
nonetheless encouraging, at least in suggesting that substantial variation can be predicted by a
categorization that has many fewer categories.
4.3. Characteristics of the Classes in the GSS and a (Plausibly) Aligned ACS Sample
How effective is the EGP coding for GSS respondents? The GSS collects information on
a small fraction of the number of individuals sampled for the ACS, and so it is reasonable to
wonder how well EGP performs in a dataset with typically no more than 3,000 respondents
(and usually substantially fewer), many of whom are not in the labor force. The most natural
way to assess the viability of the coding is to consider GSS-based classes alongside ACS-based
classes. This section offers reassuring evidence that no new challenges arise when the coding is
implemented for the GSS.
However, it should be stressed at the outset that no perfectly aligned analysis can be
performed. The GSS is a national sample of English and Spanish speakers living in housing
units (and prior to 2006, only English speakers). The ACS is a national sample of all individuals
living in the United States. Although the ACS group quarters sample can easily be dropped to
better align with the target population of the GSS, there is no obvious way to subset the ACS
records to form a random sample of English and Spanish speakers.8
Question differences are an even greater obstacle to a perfectly aligned comparative
analysis, given mode of response, wording, and reference periods for employment, work status,
Other differences related to sampling and nonresponse exist as well. The ACS PUMS record selection,
as well as weights, incorporate adjustments based on other census data sources. The GSS does not use
these adjustments. The ACS imputes item-specific nonresponse using donor records. The GSS does not
impute item-specific nonresponse.

occupation, and earnings categories, both within and between the ACS and GSS. While race,
ethnicity, gender, and place of birth are elicited with very similar questions, some crucial
differences are present for others. To give a sense of these comparison challenges, here is some
additional detail for how the ACS and GSS differ when eliciting occupations and earnings:
Occupation. For the ACS, the occupation elicited is the one held at the time of
the survey or “most recently.” The 2015 instrument instructs that the person completing
the form “Describe clearly this person’s chief job activity or business last week. If this
person had more than one job, describe the one at which this person worked the most
hours. If this person had no job or business last week, give information for his/her last
job or business.” Respondents are then asked “What kind of work was this person
doing?” and “What were this person’s most important activities or duties?” For
respondents who return the paper form by mail, they write in a phrase in a provided
box in response to each question. Those who do not return the survey form by mail are
then subsampled for follow-up nonresponse conversion. Some receive a telephone
interview, and some receive an in-person interview, during which they provide the
same information and during which an interviewer can probe for clarity.
For the GSS, an in-person interview is usually conducted, but some interviews
occur by telephone when the respondent refuses an in-person interview. After a series
of screener questions to determine whether the respondent has a current job, the
respondent is asked one of two questions: (1) “What kind of work do you normally do?
That is, what is your job called?” or (2) “What kind of work did you normally do? That
is, what was your job called?” The interviewer is then instructed to probe for clarity and
elaboration and told “IF NOT ALREADY ANSWERED, ASK: What do you actually do
in that job? Tell me what are some of your main duties?” or “IF NOT ALREADY
ANSWERED, ASK: What did you actually do in that job? Tell me what were some of
your main duties?”
Overall, the ACS and GSS are designed to prompt a respondent to recall similar
information, but in somewhat different ways. The job description provided in the GSS
interview has to pass an interviewer threshold of clarity, enhanced by guided followups, while for many ACS respondents this is not the case. In addition, the GSS elicits the
occupation of the respondent, while the ACS elicits occupation from a household
informant who is the survey respondent. Neither survey, without other labor force
participation information, clarifies how recently the job elicited was held, if it is not
currently being held.
Earnings. For the ACS, income is collected in a section on the form with
introductory instructions: “Mark (X) the ‘Yes’ box for each type of income this person
received, and give your best estimate of the TOTAL AMOUNT during the PAST 12
MONTHS. (NOTE: The ‘past 12 months’ is the period from today’s date one year ago up
through today.)” ACS respondents are then asked to place digits in boxes for multiple

26

categories, directly above the words “TOTAL AMOUNT for the past 12 months.” The
two standard components of personal earnings/income for the analysis of the ACS are
the specific numerical values offered in response to two categories described on the form
as “Wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, or tips from all jobs. Report amount before
deductions for taxes, bonds, dues, or other items” and “Self-employment income from
own nonfarm businesses or farm businesses, including proprietorships and
partnerships. Report NET income after business expenses.”
For the GSS, respondents are asked two income questions, after questions on
household structure and on the number of earners in the family in the last calendar year
(e.g., for 2013, during interviews conducted from spring through early fall of 2014).
They are presented with a showcard with 25 income ranges, from (A) for (Y), for income
intervals such as “Under $1,000,” “$35,000 to 39,999,” and “$150,000 or over.” They are
then instructed, as in the 2014 GSS: “In which of these groups did your total family
income, from all sources, fall last year – 2013 – before taxes, that is. Just tell me the letter.
Total income includes interest or dividends, rent, Social Security, other pensions,
alimony or child support, unemployment compensation, public aid (welfare), armed
forces or veteran's allotment.” The respondent is then asked whether they earned any
income in the prior calendar year from the job they identified earlier in the interview. If
they answer yes, they are then asked “In which of these groups did your earnings from
{your job}, from all sources for 2013 fall? That is, before taxes or other deductions. Just
tell me the letter.”
Altogether, the ACS personal earnings variable, and the GSS personal
earnings/income variable differ in several ways. They refer to different 12-month
intervals. The ACS is based on self-reported dollar values, while the GSS is based on a
set of ordered earnings/income categories. Finally, the ACS asks about wages and
salaries from all jobs in the immediately prior twelve months, whereas the GSS asks only
about the primary job elicited earlier, and in the prior calendar year. The GSS,
furthermore, gives no guidance on how self-employment income should be included, or
not, in its personal earnings/income question, although this is likely the intent of the “all
sources” language that concludes the survey item.
For the 10-class version of EGP, Table 5 presents the class distribution, mean years of
education by class, and mean personal earnings by class for best-possible aligned samples
drawn from a pooling of the 2012 and 2014 GSS and from a pooling of the 2012 and 2014 ACS.
For the ACS, the sample composition is the same as for Table 1, but restricted to only 2012 and
2014 respondents who are not resident in group quarters (for samples sizes of 1,691,754 total for
full-time, full-year workers and 2,717,746 for all workers). For the GSS, the sample was
restricted to respondents in either 2012 or 2014, aged 25 to 64. For the GSS, “full-time, full year
workers” are defined as having worked at least 50 weeks, usually full-time, in the previous
calendar year, and reporting at least $10,623 (in 2013 dollars, which is equivalent to $10,440 in
2015 dollars) over the previous year (N= 677 in 2012 and N = 911 in 2014). For the GSS, “all

27

workers” are defined as having worked at least 1 week in the prior year, either full-time or parttime (N= 1,107 in 2012 and N = 1,473 in 2014).
For the ACS earnings values, we used the raw dollar values reported, adjusted to 2013
dollars (the calendar year prior to the last GSS wave, 2014). For the GSS, we needed to
transform the categorical earnings variable, as detailed in the table just below. In brief, we
selected midpoints of the categories and a Pareto multiplier for the top category (see Morgan
and Tang 2007). We then adjusted the values for the 2012 GSS, which is the 2011 calendar year,
to 2013 dollars. As a result, the mean values for earnings in the GSS are mean values only
across the 50 plausible values below, which is far fewer values than for the ACS, where dollarby-dollar values are utilized.

Social Survey 2012 and 2014 files (extracted from the 1972-2014 cumulative file, release 6)
Notes: For both the ACS and the GSS, dollar values were adjusted to 2013 dollars. For the ACS, the sample
composition is the same as for Table 1, but restricted to only 2012 and 2014 respondents who are not resident in
group quarters (for samples sizes of 1,691,754 total for full-time, full-year workers and 2,717,746 for all workers). For
the GSS, the sample was restricted to respondents in either 2012 or 2014, aged 25 to 64. For the GSS, “full-time, full
year workers” are defined as having worked at least 50 weeks, usually full-time, in the previous calendar year, and
reporting at least $10,623 (in 2013 dollars, which is equivalent to $10,440 in 2015 dollars) over the previous year (N=
677 in 2012 and N = 911 in 2014). For the GSS, “all workers” are defined as having worked at least 1 week in the prior
year, either full-time or part-time (N= 1,107 in 2012 and N = 1,473 in 2014). For the GSS, we did not impute itemspecific missing data (in the “all worker” sample: 1 case for education and 165 cases for earnings). The GSS sample
weight (wtssnr) was adjusted to give respondents from 2012 larger weights to compensate for its smaller size relative
to 2014. Cells were left blank if the sample size was less than 15 (i.e., N < 15).

29

Remember that the GSS samples are much smaller (2,580 workers in this age range, of
whom only 1,588 are full-time, full-year workers) than the ACS samples (2,717,746 workers in
this age range, of whom only 1,691,754 are full-time, full-year workers). Indeed, the ACS
sample is the equivalent of more than 1,000 GSS samples. Even so, the alignment between the
GSS and ACS results in Table 5 is reassuring.
Consider first the distributions of the 10 classes in columns 1 and 2, which are very
similar. Both surveys appear to be collecting occupation information from the same population,
and coding that information in the same way. The largest differences that exist (e.g., for classes
I, VIIa, and for the military) are consistent with expected sampling variation in the GSS. And
the mismatch is larger when the sample is narrowed to full-time, full-year workers. This is a
smaller sample, and the definition of “full-time, full-year” differs a bit across the two surveys,
based on the reference period utilized, as well as full-time items (a question on usual hours for
the ACS, but a question on usually full-time for the GSS). Nonetheless, we cannot know
whether some differences are systematic (as could be the case, for example, if the ACS uses
poststratification to generate a lower rate of “Military” occupations).
Similarly, the mean education of each of these classes suggests that the occupational
incumbents have similar education levels. There is more variation in personal earnings across
classes, with the GSS typically delivering higher levels. Nonetheless, as explained above, the
questions that elicit the information have substantial differences.
To probe further, Table 6 presents demographic characteristics for the plausibly aligned
GSS and ACS samples, analogous to those presented above in Table 3. Again, we see a great
deal of consistency in how the coding functions in both the GSS and the ACS.

Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate that the 10-class version of the EGP coding delivers similar
results for the GSS and for the ACS. What about the 11 and 12 class versions? As explained
above, the 11-class version of EGP has one additional class, which is class IVab, and which
represents all self-employed individuals in the occupations assigned to classes IIIa, IIIb, V, VI,
and VIIa for the 10-class version of EGP. The 12-class version of EGP separates class IVab into
classes IVa and IVb, with the former compromising the subset of individuals who report having
employees.9
For the both the ACS and GSS, it is possible to code the 11-class version. For the GSS, it
is also possible to code the 12-class version from 2004 onward. Self-employment is embedded
within the ACS “class of worker” item, but it is a separate item on the GSS. Table 7 reveals the
difference in a comparison of the GSS to the ACS, again using the 10-class version of EGP. The
percent of class members who are employed by private employers, public employers, and who
are self-employed adds to 100 percent (subject to rounding) for the ACS but not for the GSS.
Accordingly, the “private employer” designation is more common in the GSS, since it includes
many self-employed individuals. In addition, it would appear that more individuals report
being self-employed in the GSS. It is unclear whether these differences reflect the different
structures of the items, or whether they are complicated by individuals holding more than one
job.
Table 8, which has the same structure as Table 7, allocates individuals to the 11-class
version of EGP (and for the GSS, also the 12-class version of EGP). As a result, various “All”
and “None” entries are introduced as structural zeroes (based on definitions, not realized
samples of zero). With the implementation of the 11-class and 12-class versions of EGP shown
in Table 8, Tables 9 and 10 present the same outcomes analyzed, respectively, for Tables 5 and 6.
With the caveat that GSS-ACS comparisons are more difficult because of differences in selfemployment rates across the surveys, we continue to see considerable similarity across both
data sources.

In some realizations of the EGP class schema, class IVa includes self-employed individuals who have 10
or more employees while class IVb includes self-employed individuals who have fewer than 10
employees. I have implemented the 1-or-more cutoff instead, under the assumption that individuals who
have many employees are more likely to select class I occupations, such as Chief Executive, which never
end up in either class IVa or class IVb because of the first-stage coding of the 10-class schema.

5. Sample Stata Code for Merging the .csv File and the GSS Cumulative File
The following Stata code demonstrates how to code the 10, 11, and 12-class versions of
EGP in the GSS cumulative file, by first merging in the crosswalk from the .csv file named
occ10-to-egp-class-crosswalk.csv. The syntax also contains basic tabulate commands to
demonstrate what the code accomplishes. This code can be copied directly from this pdf file,
and it is also available in the text file named code-for-egp-crosswalk.do, which is available
along with the .csv file.

6. Conclusions
As discussed in the first pages of this report, principled reasons exist to eschew all usage
of the EGP class schema, in its original form or in this new coding. If one accepts that EGP is a
worthwhile measure to have, the value of this particular coding depends in part on its rationale
and in part on its future demonstrated value in empirical research. I have endeavored to
explain the full set of coding decisions taken so that potential users can evaluate whether to
adopt this coding for their own research projects. I have also offered a detailed analysis that
compares the coding when used in the ACS and the GSS, to the extent that such a comparison is
possible. This analysis should generate confidence that the coding can be used to advance
research in many domains, but that confidence awaits full justification from new topical
research.
Nonetheless, rather than include the new EGP variable as an official GSS variable, I am
instead posting the merge file to the GSS website to facilitate considered adoption in whole, or
partial adoption based on the user’s own tailoring. The associated files can be easily revised
before being merged into the GSS. A few words of caution are in order for those inclined to
revise: Occupations are not always interpretable without first consulting the SOC and its
underlying descriptions of job activities and job titles. In addition, lay notions of what
occupations would seem to be do not always match the characteristics of occupational
incumbents, or the nature of the work performed. Finally, the GSS itself is too small to yield
precise estimates of the characteristics of occupational incumbents, and therefore a larger data
source such as the ACS must be consulted when changes are considered.
