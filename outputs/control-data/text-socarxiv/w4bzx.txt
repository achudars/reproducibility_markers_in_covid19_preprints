Abstract
This paper describes trends in parental wealth homogamy among union cohorts formed
between 1987 and 2013 in Denmark. Using high-quality register data on the wealth of
parents during the year of partnering, we show that the correlation between partners’ levels
of parental wealth is considerably lower compared to estimates from earlier research on
other countries. Nonetheless, parental wealth homogamy is high at the very top of the
parental wealth distribution, and individuals from wealthy families are relatively unlikely to
partner with individuals from families with low wealth. Parental wealth correlations among
partners are higher when looking only at parental assets rather than net wealth, implying
that the former might be a better measure for studying many social stratification processes.
Most specifications indicate that homogamy increased in the 2000s relative to the 1990s, but
trends can vary depending on methodological choices. The increasing levels of parental
wealth homogamy raise concerns that, over time, partnering behavior has become more
consequential for wealth inequality between couples.

Partnering behavior is a key determinant of various aspects of well-being (Schwartz 2013).
From an economic point of view, marriage and cohabitation are a foundation for sharing
many public goods, specialization, risk pooling, and the coordination of domestic labor
among partners (Browning et al. 2014). Therefore, it is unsurprising that couples do not form
at random or irrespective of partner’s characteristics and that marital sorting is a key feature
of marriage models (Becker 1973, 1991; Lam 1988). Social scientists have long documented
patterns of assortative mating based on ascribed characteristics such as parental occupation
and ethnicity (Kalmijn 1998; Schwartz 2013), as well as on acquired characteristics like
education and earnings (Blossfeld 2009; Pencavel 1998; Rosenfeld 2008; Schwartz and Mare
2005; Schwartz 2010).
Besides the impact of partnering on individual well-being, assortative mating has been of
interest for research on social stratification as it potentially impacts the distribution of
resources across households and shapes boundaries between social groups (Kremer 1997;
Schwartz 2010; 2013). In this article, we study partner selection based on parental wealth, a
characteristic that is of particular interest for social stratification research for several reasons.
First, a substantial amount of own wealth is the result of inheritances These transfers can be
observable in the wealth of individuals if parents have deceased but are generally a latent
expectation of future transfers that are not measurable at the moment of couple formation
since most parents are still alive. Kopczuk and Lupton’s (2007) review of the literature
estimates bequests to make up around 35-45% of the overall wealth of an individual in the
United States. Therefore, high levels of parental wealth homogamy may contribute to wealth
inequality between households. Second, wealth homogamy can shed light on important
questions about intergenerational mobility processes. The extent to which families reproduce
their accumulated wealth across generations through dynastic wealth is bound to depend on
partnering choices.
3

To date, few studies have examined the extent to which partners match on parental wealth.
To the best of our knowledge, the current literature is limited to a study of parental wealth
homogamy using data from 1988 for the United States (Charles et al. 2013), and an article on
the concentration of inheritances within couples in France during the 1990s and 2000s
(Fremeaux 2014). Both studies indicate that people tend to select partners similar to
themselves in terms of parental wealth. Using the 1988 wave of the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, Charles and colleagues (2013) estimated the correlation between parents’
(positive) wealth to be about .4 after controlling for age and race.
In this study, we contribute to this emerging literature by studying parental wealth homogamy
in Denmark. We use registry data for marriage and union cohorts formed between 1986 and
2013. A major contribution of our work is that we are, to our knowledge, the first to study
trends in parental wealth homogamy over time. Earlier research is limited to a finding by
Fremeaux (2014) showing that sorting on inheritances remained stable from 1992 to 2010 in
France.
Besides presenting trends in parental wealth homogamy, a second focus of our study is on
different ways of empirically estimating and interpreting trends in parental wealth
homogamy. Studying parental wealth homogamy is fraught with conceptual and
methodological challenges, which include the measurement of parental wealth, changes in the
composition of wealth across time, parental partnering dynamics and selective mortality.
Compared to earlier research, we believe that our study offers improvements to dealing with
these challenges. First, we study cohorts in the year of union formation, instead of looking at
a cross-section of unions with varying union durations. Second, we use intergenerationally
linked registry data for the entire Danish population with precise measurement of parental
wealth. Earlier studies used data on inheritances (Fremeaux 2014) or survey data based on
respondents’ recollected estimates of their own and spouses’ living parents’ wealth (Charles
4

et al. 2013). Third, we are able to (partly) recover information on parental wealth for
individuals whose parents passed away before union formation. Fourth, our data measure
parental wealth at the individual rather than the household level, allowing for a more
straightforward inclusion of re-married parents. Finally, the longitudinal data structure allows
us to verify the sensitivity of estimates to the time at which parental wealth is measured.
Given the methodological challenges in establishing parental wealth correlations, the scope of
this paper is limited to documenting trends in the overall correlation of partners’ parental
wealth. We leave questions about mechanisms underlying correlations in parental wealth,
such as homogamy based on other characteristics like own education and occupation, for
future research. Before discussing the empirical challenges of estimating parental wealth
correlations, we provide a brief theoretical discussion as to why partners might select each
other based on parental wealth, and why the importance of such mechanisms might have
changed over time.

Parental Wealth Homogamy: Mechanisms
According to Kalmijn (1998), partnering homogamy is influenced by i) preferences of
individuals for partners with certain characteristics, ii) the interference of third parties in the
selection process, and iii) constraints on the chances of meeting people due to structural
factors. There are good reasons to expect that people prefer partners with high parental
wealth. It can have a direct positive influence on the attractiveness of potential partners since
it is likely to be transferred to children in the future (Boserup et al. 2018; Killewald et al.
2017; Schneider, 2011; Spilerman 2000).

Parental wealth can also affect attractiveness

through indirect routes. It allows parents to invest in their children’s human capital and

5

facilitates access to better health and education (Eads and Tach, 2016; Killewald et al. 2017;
Pfeffer 2011; 2018; Pfeffer and Schoeni, 2016; Rauscher 2016; Thompson and Conley 2016).
Parents are also the most obvious third party with an interest in the partnering choices of their
children (Kalmijn 1998; Rosenfeld and Kim 2005). They might have direct preferences for
seeing their children partner into a rich family, as this means that their child marries into
wealth that it can potentially access. They might also have indirect reasons, as parents’ class
and lifestyle preferences might extend to their child’s partner and hence prefer someone who
formed his habits with similar access to economic resources
The third factor influencing homogamy according to Kalmijn is the opportunity to meet
individuals with similar characteristics. Even without explicit preferences for parental wealth
and its related characteristics, homogamy might simply arise because individuals born into
wealthier or poorer families are more likely to be in contact with each other. This becomes
clear once thinking about the influence that parental wealth can exert on residential,
educational and occupational segregation, lifestyle habits and social networks. That there is
residential segregation due to parental wealth during childhood and potentially young
adulthood is obvious. But even when offspring leave the parental home, the family’s wealth
and access to resources can enable them to rent or buy residences in different areas than
individuals growing up in a less economically advantaged family environment (Charles and
Hurst 2002). Further, family wealth influences the likelihood to attend schools and
universities and as a consequence to move in social networks acquired through attending
these educational institutions (Blossfeld 2009).

6

Changes over Time
Theories about modernization generally hypothesize that homogamy based on ascribed
characteristics (such as parental wealth) declines over time, whereas acquired characteristics
gain in importance (Kalmijn 1991). Educational expansion, longer educational careers, and
higher geographical mobility are expected to have increased the importance of own
socioeconomic standing, social networks, lifestyles, and preferences relative to parental
characteristics (Blossfeld 2009; Rosenfeld and Kim 2005; Schwartz 2013). Declining levels
of homogamy have been observed for ascribed characteristics such as parental occupation
(Henz and Mills 2018; Kalmijn 1991; Rosenfeld 2008). One might expect this pattern to
extend to parental wealth homogamy too.
A reason why parental wealth might, on the other hand, have become more important in
partner search is that wealth inequality has increased considerably in many Western countries
(Piketty 2014). This higher inequality might have made the benefits stemming from wealth
stronger and more salient. Studies have found some support for increased homogamy (Torche
2010; Monaghan 2015) and longer partner searches (Gould and Passerman 2003) in contexts
of high income inequality. Furthermore, increased wealth inequality can lead to more
pronounced differences in tastes and cultural practices, and augment residential segregation,
thus reducing opportunities of individuals from different family backgrounds to meet (Smith
et al. 2014).

When to Measure Parental Wealth? A Methodological and Conceptual Challenge
So far, our discussion, as well as the existing research on parental wealth homogamy (Charles
et al., 2013; Fremeaux, 2014), have treated parental wealth as a stable characteristic of

7

individuals. In reality, parental wealth changes over time. This poses conceptual as well as
methodological challenges on when and how to best measure parental wealth. Even though
the wealth of a family at a given point in time is highly predictive of wealth at a later
moment, wealth depends on time-varying processes such as housing prices, stock market
fluctuations, individual earnings and consumption patterns, as well as windfalls or unlucky
events. A family’s position in the wealth distribution thus depends on the time of
measurement. This raises the question of when the wealth of parents should be measured. The
answer depends on the mechanisms that one expects to be most relevant for partner selection.
We propose three theoretical possibilities that will be translated into specific measures in the
empirical section.
If one considers parental wealth as a socialization factor that shapes individuals’ preferences
and lifestyles, and therewith structures interpersonal networks and opportunities to meet
potential partners in life, parents' wealth position during childhood and adolescence might be
the best indicator to employ. In contrast, if one expects parental wealth to matter for partner
selection primarily because it is an economic resource that children signal directly to future
partners, the wealth parents have at the time of union formation might be the best indicator of
transfers and inheritances a couple can expect to receive in the future. A problem with using
parental wealth at the time of union formation as an indicator of future financial help and
transfers a person might receive is that wealth is highly dependent on age. Individuals tend to
accumulate wealth throughout adulthood with a peak around age 60, after which levels of
wealth start declining (Killewald et al., 2017). Therefore, an individual with young parents
might have low parental wealth at union formation, but this might be a poor predictor of
parents’ future wealth, and hence, the volume of expected transfers and inheritances. In that
case, a measure that indicates parents’ wealth relative to their peers of the same age might be
the most relevant measure to employ. In our empirical analysis, we employ measures
8

corresponding to each of these three categories to examine the relevance of measurement
timing.

Our Study: Parental Wealth Homogamy in Denmark
In this paper, we study trends in parental wealth homogamy in Denmark from 1987 to 2013.
Not all mechanisms discussed above may apply to Denmark to the same extent. On the one
hand, even though income inequality is relatively low in Denmark, wealth inequality is
surprisingly high in comparison to other Western countries (Balestra and Tonkin 2018).
Wealth inequality has been fairly stable in Denmark over the last decades, except for slightly
increasing wealth shares among the top 1% (Jakobsen et al. 2018). On the other hand, with a
correlation in wealth across generations of around 0.4, the intergenerational transmission of
wealth in Denmark is low compared to the United States (Boserup et al. 2013), which could
reduce the preference for partners with high parental wealth. Furthermore, even though the
greatest expansion of tertiary education in Denmark took place before the 1980s, rates of
tertiary education attendance have risen steadily between 1980 and 2010 (Barro and Lee
2015). Educational expansion might have increased the possibilities to partner across parental
wealth boundaries, as tertiary education became less restricted to a select group of
individuals. Previous research on Denmark suggests that educational homogamy declined to
some extent (Breen and Andersen, 2012), with roughly half of the sorting on education being
due to partners attending educational institutions nearby (Nielsen and Svarer, 2009).

Data and Method
Our analysis is based on the Danish register data, which is available for researchers in
anonymized form through Statistics Denmark. This comprehensive data on the complete
9

population residing in Denmark during the years 1986-2013 come from several public
administration registers, which are linked by Statistics Denmark through unique personal
identification numbers provided to all individuals at birth. These unique longitudinal data are
accessible to researchers in anonymized form through Statistics Denmark’s secure servers.
Information from the population registers allows us to link parents to children.
Our sample includes all different-sex co-residing unions formed during the period 1987-2013.
Union formation is determined based on two individuals entering into co-residence. This
captures couples who were either married, had a registered partnership, cohabited with
children or cohabited without children (Drefahl 2012).2 A requirement for inclusion in our
sample is the presence of parental identification numbers of the father and the mother of both
partners, allowing us to link parents to children in the registry data. Such parental
identification numbers have been systematically recorded for all individuals born after 1960,
but are incomplete for earlier birth cohorts (Boserup et al. 2013).3 Therefore, we restrict our
sample to couples where both partners are between 18 and 34 years old at the time of union
formation. In robustness checks, we expand this age range to 40 but restrict the period
covered by our analysis to 1992-2013.4 Finally, we exclude couples where one of the parents
was not present in the registry data after 1980 (the first year we have information on wealth).
Parents are not present in the registry data if they have passed away or live abroad. Hence,
our analysis excludes a large part of foreign-born individuals who moved to Denmark
without their parents; later we discuss how this restriction might impact our results.

2

This latter category only includes households of two unrelated adults who had an age difference of less than 15
years and who were not related by family ties. A small minority of cases might therefore not regard romantically
involved individuals. In robustness checks we exclude unions that lasted less than 3 years to filter out such
possible arrangements as much as possible; see figure A1 in the Online Appendix, results do not change.
3
Figure B1 in the Online Appendix shows the distribution of cases that had no parental identification numbers
by age and year. There we also discuss various robustness checks that address concerns about whether a
changing age composition of the sample affected results (e.g. including sample weights to compensate for
possible unequal probabilities of inclusion by birth year)

Parental Wealth
Tax registries in Denmark collect data on the value of individuals’ assets and liabilities,
mostly provided by third parties (e.g. assessments of housing values are made by the tax
authorities). Denmark taxed wealth until 1996, but the collection of wealth data continued
with some slight modifications after its abolishment (Jakobsen et al., 2018). Following
Boserup et al. 2013, we define net wealth as total assets (financial assets and housing) minus
debts as retrieved by Statistics Denmark from data collected by the Danish Tax Agency.
Wealth comprises a large variety of sources including the value of properties such as houses,
boats and cars; bonds; stocks; cash in banks; the value of businesses; loans; and mortgages.
One component not included in the measurement of wealth is accumulated pension wealth.
Most information is provided by third parties such as banks, financial institutions, and other
governmental bodies. The value of properties is assessed by tax authorities based on detailed
information on their characteristics (Boserup et al. 2013).5 During the observation period,
there are changes in how some sources of wealth are reported, mainly due to the removal of
the wealth tax in 1996. Specifically, the value of stocks was self-reported until 1996 but
provided by financial institutions ever since, some assets that were self-reported until 1996
were not recorded anymore after that (including cars, boats, caravans), and the registration of
company values changed several times until 1997 (Jakobsen et al. 2018). Boserup and
colleagues (2013) exploited an overlap in both ways of measuring wealth to show how the
measurement of wealth from 1997 onward was well approximated by the measurement of
wealth up to that point.

5

Tax-assessed housing values have historically not always reflected fully the market values at the time.
Following Boserup et al. (2013) and Browning et al. (2013), we adjust tax assessed housing values with a factor
that reflects the average relationship between market values of traded houses and average tax assessed values,
thus arriving at an imputed estimate of the market value of housing wealth.

11

Wealth is measured at the individual level. Therefore, we sum the wealth of parents
regardless of parents’ marital status. Parental wealth is measured separately for male and
female partners. Following earlier research (Solon 2004), we average parental wealth across
three years.6 We present our main analysis using three measures that vary in the time at
which parental wealth is measured.
Parental wealth in the year of union formation is the primary measure used in our analysis.
To construct the measure 𝑝𝑤1𝑖 capturing the parental wealth of individual i in the year of
union formation y=u let 𝑅𝑦=𝑢,𝑠𝑒𝑥(𝑖) be an operator assigning the percentile rank based on the
distribution of parental wealth of all individuals that formed a union in the same year y=u and
that are of the same 𝑠𝑒𝑥(𝑖) as individual i. Assigning the rank as a function of gender means
that we separately look at the parental wealth distribution of all daughters and of all sons that
formed a union in year y.7 Parental wealth 𝑤𝑝 = 𝑤𝑓 + 𝑤𝑚 is calculated as being the sum of
the wealth of fathers 𝑤𝑓 and mothers 𝑤𝑚 .8
(1) 𝑝𝑤1𝑖 = 𝑅𝑦=𝑢,𝑠𝑒𝑥(𝑖) (𝑤𝑝,𝑖,𝑦=𝑢 )
In robustness checks, we log transform the total sum of parental wealth in the year of union
formation, instead of using a rank-based measure.
The second measure we employ indicates parental wealth in the year of union formation
normalized by father’s age. In this case, before calculating the rank of parental wealth within
a given union cohort, parental wealth is normalized separately by the father’s age. As this

6

All wealth and income components are deflated with a GDP deflator to the 2010 price level.
Robustness checks calculating percentiles based on the wealth rank of all parents with children between ages
18 and 35 produced practically identical results, see Online Appendix D. This wealth rank is also used for our
description of partnering probabilities by parental wealth (See Figure 4).
8
In reality we calculate the percentiles on the distribution of year normalized wealth, so instead of 𝑤𝑝𝑖,𝑦=𝑢 we
calculate (𝑤𝑝𝑖,𝑦=𝑢 − 𝜇𝑦=𝑢 (𝑤𝑝 ))⁄𝑠𝑑𝑦=𝑢 (𝑤𝑝 ), meaning we substract the average of parental wealth in the year of
union formation and divide by its standard deviation. This results in the same distribution, except that it allows
us to pull forward the wealth of deceased parents in a comparable way and integrate it into the wealth
distribution of the year that their child formed a union.
7

12

measure reflects the wealth of parents relative to peers from their specific birth cohorts, it
also accounts, to some extent, for the distribution of children’s age at union formation, as
older individuals are likely to have older parents on average. Normalization is done by
subtracting the average 𝜇 and calculating the standard deviation sd of the wealth of all parents
where the father has the same age as the father of individual i 𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑓) = 𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑓𝑖) and where
union formation took place in year u.

(2) 𝑝𝑤2𝑖 = 𝑅𝑦=𝑢,𝑠𝑒𝑥(𝑖) [

𝑤𝑝,𝑖 − 𝜇𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑓)=𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑓𝑖) (𝑤𝑝 )
⁄𝑠𝑑
]
𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑓)=𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑓𝑖) (𝑤𝑝 )

A third and final measure employed is parental wealth at age 18. This measure is based on
the level of parental wealth in the year when respondents were aged 18, which is denoted as
𝑤𝑝,𝑦=(𝑦|𝑎𝑔𝑒=18) . We subsequently normalized individuals’ wealth by subtracting the average
of parental wealth at age 18 and dividing by the standard deviation. The sample from which
we calculated the mean and standard deviation consisted of all individuals who are of the
same age 𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑖) and sex as i and also formed a union in year u.
(3) 𝑝𝑤3𝑖 =
𝑅𝑦=𝑢,𝑠𝑒𝑥(𝑖) [

𝑤𝑝,𝑖,𝑦=(𝑦|𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑖)=18) − 𝜇𝑎𝑔𝑒=𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑖), (𝑤𝑝,𝑦=(𝑦|𝑎𝑔𝑒=18) )
⁄𝑠𝑑
𝑎𝑔𝑒=𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑖) (𝑤𝑝,𝑦=(𝑦|𝑎𝑔𝑒=18) )

]
Due to the stricter data requirements, the sample used for this measure is smaller than the
samples obtained for the two other wealth measures. In additional analysis, we reproduce the
three parental wealth measures based on the total value of owned assets only (i.e. without
subtracting debt). Further discussion of the implications of changing the time of measurement
for conclusions can be found in the Online Appendix F.

13

Besides choosing the point in time at which we measure parental wealth, there are two other
important measurement complications. Firstly, parents might have passed away before wealth
is measured. Fremeaux (2014) tackled this issue in his study on inheritance homogamy by
combining information on inheritances received with estimates of expected inheritances.
Charles and colleagues (2013) did not have information on the wealth of parents who passed
away. Our solution is to measure parental wealth in the last wave before union formation
where both parents were still alive.9 In robustness checks, we exclude cases where a parent
passed away before union formation. Our measure of parental wealth at age 18 excludes
cases where parents had passed away before age 18.
Secondly, parents might be separated at the time of their children’s union formation. If
parents re-partner, household-based measures of wealth might complicate arriving at a
comparable measure of parental wealth for individuals whose parents did and did not form
new families. Charles and colleagues (2013) therefore excluded individuals with re-married
parents. Danish registry data allow for the measurement of wealth at the individual level,
enabling us to sum parents’ individual wealth and to disregard the wealth of eventual new
partners. In robustness checks, couples with one or more re-married parents are excluded
from the analysis.

Sample Description
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the overall sample of 803,185 couples with full
information on parental wealth in the year of union formation. Besides descriptive statistics
for the sample overall, averages are presented for unions formed in 1987 and 2013 to monitor

9

Parental wealth is in these cases normalized in the year both parents were still alive and this value is
subsequently used in the calculation of the parental wealth rank for each annual union cohort.

14

changes over time in the composition of the sample of unions. The descriptive statistics show
that men are on average older than women at union formation, and the same applies to their
parents. Ages of all individuals involved have slightly increased during the observation
period. We treat married and cohabiting couples as one group because cohabitation as an
alternative to marriage is widespread in Denmark: in our sample, only 6% of unions started as
a marriage.10 Parental wealth is higher for the parents of men than for those of women. 25%
of men’s parents report negative wealth and this share increased with time from 18% in 1987
to 35% in 2013. Due to the precise measurement of wealth, very few couples had zero wealth
(less than 0.2% of cases). In comparison, estimates from the Survey of Consumer Finances
indicate that around one in five households in the US had zero or negative wealth in 2016
(Wolff, 2017). Negative wealth can arise due to recent investments made and accumulated
debts. However, a likely source for higher levels of negative wealth in our data is the
potential mismatch between the value of houses as estimated by the authorities and the real
market value of a property.11 We pay particular attention to cases with negative parental
wealth in the analysis and exclude them in robustness checks (Online Appendix G).
Figure 1 breaks down the wealth of the male partners’ parents into housing assets, financial
assets, and debt. Housing assets make up most of the wealth across the distribution, even
though financial assets become more visible at the top of the wealth distribution.12

10

In 2018, one in four Danish couples were cohabiting rather than married, and the same cohabitation rate
applies to couples with children, according to own calculations based on data from Statistics Denmark,
www.statistikbanken.dk.
11
Information on tax assessed housing values should in principle reflect market values for comparable traded
houses. However, as the majority of houses are not traded each year, the tax authorities’ estimated market values
of houses may be too low (high), which can happen because specific unobserved characteristics such as e.g.
interior design (new kitchen or bathrooms) are not taken into account by valuation authorities. Thus, the higher
actual market values can translate into higher mortgages as compared to the value of the house as indicated by
the taxable values available in the data.
12
With financial deregulation and various reforms through the 1990s and early 2000s, house owners access to
e.g. refinancing their mortgage debt implied on average an increase in debt in relation to housing values
(Browning et al. 2013).

Therefore, very low levels of wealth might indicate recent investments made rather than an
economically difficult situation (Killewald 2013). Figure 2 shows trends in median and mean
absolute deflated wealth over time. Median and mean wealth declined very slightly until the

16

mid-1990s, took off dramatically after that, and decreased considerably after the onset of the
financial crisis.

studies of wealth inequality (Danish Economic Council, 2016; Balestra and Tonkin 2018).

Procedure
Since the main aim of this article is descriptive, we mostly concentrate on presenting and
interpreting trends in parental homogamy in detail. We commence the analysis by giving an
indication of the likelihood to partner based on parental wealth. Then, we describe how
individuals who do form a union select each other based on parental wealth. To do so, we
first document the relative frequency of couple combinations based on men’s and women’s
parental wealth percentiles using a heatmap. In a second step, we show average male
partner’s parental wealth according to the female partner’s parental wealth. This will give
18

insights into whether there are non-linearities in how wealth rank affects partnering behavior.
Following this detailed descriptive effort, we summarize the overall strength of assortative
mating using yearly correlations in partners’ parental wealth. This allows us to show how
wealth homogamy changed over time. Finally, we test the robustness of these trends by
using different measures and sample restrictions

Results
We start by describing how the probability of forming a new partnership is influenced by
parental wealth. The grey line of Figure 4 represents the probability that an individual aged
18 to 34 forms a new union in a given year depending on the wealth percentile of the parents,
while the black line shows the same measure but for the first partnership observed only.13 We
can conclude that individuals from wealthier backgrounds are somewhat more likely to ever
enter into a union but at the same time slightly less likely to form a new partnership at any
point in time. This suggests that re-partnering is more common among individuals with lower
parental wealth, but overall differences in first partnering and overall partnering by family
background are very small.
Figure 5 is a heatmap showing how frequently men and women with given levels of parental
wealth form unions together. The graph depicts the joint distribution of parental wealth by
percentiles, showing wealth percentiles of men’s parents on the x-axis and those of their
female partners on the y-axis.

13

Note that for part of the sample we do not observe all partnerships as partners are only recorded from 1986
onward, some of the ‘first partnerships’ we observe in the data might therefore in fact be a second, third or
higher order partner of an individual.

If people married independently of parental wealth one would expect partnering to be
relatively homogeneously distributed across parental wealth percentiles. Men and women in
each percentile should form couples with approximately 1% of the members of each parental
wealth percentile of the opposite sex. The graph displays the empirical joint partnering
distribution by showing the estimated proportions of couples found in each of the 100*100
cells. A value of 1 in Figure 5 indicates an observed frequency that would be expected if
partnering were to be at random, a value of 2 indicates a relative frequency that is twice
greater than expected. Yellow and red areas indicate relatively common combinations (up to
2.5 times the probability of the random match), whereas blue areas are relatively less
common (less than the probability of the random match).
We observe high relative frequencies along the diagonal, indicating positive assortative
mating, and a concentration of couples in the top-right corner, corresponding to couples
where both his and her parents are among the wealthiest of their union cohorts. At the same
time, the blue areas in the top-left and bottom-right corners reveal that individuals from the
wealthiest families are relatively unlikely to partner with individuals from families in the
bottom 30% of the wealth distributions. Summing up, individuals from the wealthiest
families are the most likely to form homogenous partnerships and they avoid partnering with
individuals from families with low levels of wealth.
Figure E1 in the Online Appendix shows yearly versions of the heatmap displayed in Figure
1. These figures illustrate that the wealthy tend to increasingly partner amongst each other
and avoid individuals from families with little wealth over time.14 These trends would suggest
an increase in parental wealth homogamy during our observation period. A peculiarity in
14

Online Appendix E also provides estimates of changes over time in the chances of partnering. The relationship
between parental wealth and forming a first partnership during the observation period is relatively stable across
union cohorts; whereas the chances of forming a new partnership in any given year slightly declined for
individuals with wealthy parents as compared to individuals with less parental wealth due to increases in repartnering over time.

21

Figures 4 and E1 consists of the green areas observed along the x- and y-axes which indicate
the likelihood to partner with an individual from the very bottom of the parental wealth
distribution. These individuals have parents with (large amounts of) negative wealth, an issue
we address later.
Figure 6 serves to further illustrate the joint parental wealth distribution of partners’ parental
wealth and its evolution over time. It shows the average parental wealth percentile of male
partners according to female partners’ parental wealth percentile for three groups of union
cohorts. In general, the more parental wealth female partners have, the higher the parental
wealth of their partner. The tendency of partners’ parental wealth to increase with their own
parental wealth is stronger for more recent union cohorts, again indicating a rise in
homogamy over time. The largest differences in average parental wealth observed amount to
a difference of 12 percentiles in the average parental wealth rank of male partners.
An exception to the generally positive association is observed for women with very low
parental wealth whose partners’ average parental wealth is not as low as one might expect.
This could be because debt can indicate access to credit rather than a severely disadvantaged
economic situation (Killewald 2013). Given that a large portion of debt is mortgage debt or
other debt requiring collateral, these might be parents who made an investment in a business,
bought a new house, or whose existing house value has fallen due to the recession or house
price development (as previously mentioned, negative wealth might also reflect that housing
values in the data sometimes underestimate actual market values). To understand this issue
better, we exclude debt from the analysis for the right panel of Figure 6. Recalculating
parental wealth percentiles based only on assets makes the non-linear relationship between

22

partners’ parental wealth disappear15 and shows generally stronger levels of homogamy than
our measure based on parental wealth (i.e. assets minus debts).

Correlation in ranks

on assets only. Correlations for all three parental wealth measures considered are relatively

15

Part of the non-linearity persists for the unions formed before 1997. This likely reflects changes in how some
business assets were recorded. Before 1997 business assets were reported net of debts, and our indicator of
assets only could therefore still take on negative values before 1997.

23

small across the period and range between 0.04 and 0.19. Correlations in parental assets are
slightly higher and range between 0.10 and 0.23 over the period.

Note. Year Percentile = pw1: Parental Wealth Measured at Union Formation, rank within union cohort; Year
and age percentile = pw2: Parental Wealth Measured at Union Formation, normalized by paternal age within a

measured at age 18, normalized for age cohort, ranked within union cohort. The right pane is equivalent
numbers based on assets only (i.e. not subtracting debt). N = 803,185

Correlations are highest for parental wealth measured at union formation and ranked by union
cohort only. Once the parental wealth rank is calculated by union cohort after normalizing by
father’s age, correlations are systematically lower. Similarly, we observe that correlations of
parental wealth at age 18 are mostly lower than those of our main measure of parental wealth
at union formation. The divergence in correlations between measures could indicate that
parental wealth available at the time of union formation is more relevant for partnering
behavior than expected future wealth of parents (and related financial help and transfers) or
the wealth parents own during childhood and adolescence. An alternative explanation is that
24

accounting for parental age partly controls for age homogamy among partners (arguably, this
also applies to some extent to the measure of parental wealth at age 18). Young parents have
less wealth on average compared to older parents, and if partners select each other based on
own age, a certain level of parental age homogamy will arise as a consequence.16 In later
analysis, we observe that correlations indeed drop a bit once controlling for the ages of
partners, but the possibility that parental wealth at the time of union formation is the most
relevant for partner selection remains.
Trends over time in the parental wealth correlation are relatively consistent across the
different measures used. Both measures of parental wealth at union formation show a slight
decline in homogamy in the early 1990s, with the lowest correlations observed between 0.04
and 0.08. This is followed by steady increases observed for all three measures thereafter and
correlations peak at around 0.15-0.19 depending on the measure considered. For parental
wealth at union formation in both its forms, the correlation declines after the financial crisis,
even though it keeps increasing for parental wealth measured at age 18. One interpretation of
this result is that wealth during childhood has become increasingly important over time
relative to parental wealth at the time of union formation. However, correlations in parental
assets keep increasing after the financial crisis for all three measures alike. This raises the
question of whether periodical changes in the composition of wealth, such as the share of
parents with negative wealth, are driving this divergence in results across measures. We
scrutinize this issue further in the next section.

16

Robustness checks including controls for all parents’ and partners’ ages led to similar results; see Online
Appendix G.

25

Changing partner selection or changing distribution of wealth?
Are trends in parental wealth homogamy driven by changes in partnering behavior or by
periodic changes in the composition and distribution of wealth? Compositional changes can
affect the wealth correlation even if partnering behavior does not change. Changes in the
prices of specific assets might change the position of parents that hold these assets in the
wealth distribution. As this could affect the parental wealth correlation, the parental wealth
correlation can change without any changes in partnering behavior taking place. Examples
one might think of are house price booms in certain areas or stock price developments.
We tested for this possibility through additional analysis reported in detail in Online
Appendix F. In these checks, we investigated whether time trends in the parental wealth
correlation change once measuring parental wealth five years before union formation instead
of one year before union formation. If our results are driven by changes in actual partnering
behavior, the time of measurement should matter relatively little for trends in parental wealth
correlations over time. Conversely, if changes in the distribution of wealth drive changes in
parental wealth homogamy, measuring wealth five years before union formation should result
in a parental wealth correlation similar to the correlation observed for parental wealth at
union formation of couples formed five years before.
As shown in Figure F1 in the Online Appendix, the importance of time of measurement
varies depending on the observation period and measure chosen (net wealth or assets only).
Even though the homogamy trend is very similar once using parental wealth lagged by five
years, we observe that the trend is postponed by several years during most of the observation
period. This indicates that changes in parental wealth homogamy are not necessarily driven
by changes in partner selection. Instead, periodic changes in the distribution of wealth across

26

society probably drive part of the trends in parental wealth correlations. This is especially the
case for increases in parental wealth homogamy observed during the 2000s.
Substantively, this means that changes in the distribution of wealth over time appear to
benefit or penalize the parents of both partners in similar ways. In other words, if the parental
wealth rank of a certain individual went up in the wealth distribution during the 2000s, it is
likely that the parents of this individual’s partner also increased their wealth rank during the
2000s. Societal gains and losses in wealth appear concentrated within given social circles.
Therefore, part of the correlation between partners’ parental wealth changes in tandem with
the changing distribution of wealth in society at large.

Robustness checks and comparison with Charles and colleagues’ estimates
The main results documented so far lead to two substantive conclusions: 1) estimates of
parental wealth homogamy appear much lower in Denmark compared to earlier estimates for
the United States (Charles and colleagues found a correlation of 0.4), but 2) parental wealth
homogamy has become stronger over time. We performed various robustness checks that
simultaneously made our results more comparable to those of Charles and co-authors’ (2013)
estimates for the United States (see Online Appendix G). These robustness checks are: a)
Excluding cases where a parent had passed away before union formation (but for whom we
had recovered information on parental wealth from earlier waves); this did not change the
results; b) Excluding cases with negative parental wealth, which led to a drop in the
correlation for recent periods. In addition, trends over time became less pronounced.
Individuals from wealthy families avoid partnering with individuals with the lowest levels of
family wealth (i.e. those with negative wealth; see Figure 1), and this tendency has been
increasing over time driving up the correlation in partners’ parental wealth. Therefore,
27

excluding negative wealth flattens the trend in parental wealth homogamy over time. This
also excludes the relatively high levels of negative wealth observed in Denmark as an
explanation for the lower parental wealth correlations observed in our study as compared to
those observed for other contexts; c) Instead of normalizing and calculating the rank of
parental wealth at union formation, we log transform 3-year average wealth at union
formation. Results are consistent, but the drop observed during the crisis years now becomes
less pronounced; d) Excluding cases with re-married parents, which leads to slightly stronger
increases in parental wealth correlations over time; e) Switching from correlations to
regressions. Estimates did not change once not including control variables. But, including age
controls (father’s age, mother’s age, her age, his age) reduces correlations across the period
studied in ways that are similar to ranking parental wealth at union formation by father’s age
(Figure 7).
Applying all these changes simultaneously leads to a set of estimates that are the most
comparable to those of Charles and colleagues (2013). These estimates show a robust picture
of relatively low but increasing parental wealth homogamy over time in Denmark. Compared
to the estimate of 0.4 for the United States (Charles et al. 2013), the parental wealth
correlation in Denmark is low across specifications. It has to be noted, however, that we are
not able to gauge the possible influence of different data sources (survey data instead of
registry data) and differences in sample selection (union cohorts versus a cross-section of
unions intact at a given point in time).
In a final additional analysis, we investigated the possible consequences of having excluded
(most) foreign-born individuals from our analysis (as information on parental wealth is
mostly not available for them). Figure H1 shows how both couples consisting of two foreignborn persons and couples consisting of one foreign-born and one Denmark-born individual
have increased across time (from less than 1% to 4%, and 4% to 8%, respectively). If we
28

assume that foreign-born individuals are relatively similar in terms of parental wealth, their
inclusion in the analysis would probably slightly increase parental wealth correlations and
reinforce the upward trend observed over time. However, mixed couples consisting of one
Denmark-born and one foreign-born person are likely to be relatively dissimilar in terms of
their parental wealth. Their inclusion might therefore slightly decrease parental wealth
correlations and attenuate time trends observed. This leaves the overall impact of excluding
foreign-born individuals on our results unclear.
Lastly, Figure H2 shows that the parental wealth rank of Denmark-born individuals forming
unions with foreign-born individuals varied, without a clear trend, between the 52nd and the
54th percentile across the observation period. There are therefore no clear changes over time
in who partners a foreign-born person based on parental wealth.

Discussion
Who partners whom has long been a central question of the social sciences. Over the last
decades, quantitative studies repeatedly showed that partners match based on a variety of
ascribed and acquired characteristics (Becker 1973, 1991; Blossfeld 2009; Browning et al.
2014; Kalmijn 1998; Lam 1988; Schwartz 2013; Weiss and Willis 1998). So far, surprisingly
little attention has been paid to assortative mating based on parental wealth. Previous research
on survey data from the United States estimated that parental wealth homogamy is quite
strong (Charles et al. 2013). High levels of parental wealth homogamy are likely to be
consequential for wealth inequality between households, the transmission of family wealth
across generations, and might be an indication of family wealth shaping boundaries between
social groups. All of these reasons illustrate the importance of studying whether previous

29

findings of strong parental wealth homogamy hold once applied to a different setting and
once using more accurate data.
In this paper, we show that the correlation in partners’ parental wealth in Denmark is
relatively weak. Correlations range between 0.04 and 0.19, depending on the measure
employed and the time period considered. This result contrasts with the 0.4 correlation found
by Charles and colleagues (2013) for the United States. In general, it is perhaps unsurprising
that parental wealth homogamy is lower in Denmark than in the US, due to the relatively high
levels of intergenerational wealth mobility in Denmark (indeed, low parental wealth
homogamy might be a possible mechanism increasing mobility). However, the difference in
the estimates between both countries is much larger than the difference found in crossnational comparisons of intergenerational wealth mobility (Boserup et al. 2013: 17).
Another possibility is that the large difference in correlations between Denmark and the US
reflects different research designs. We specifically aimed to make our estimates comparable
to those of Charles and colleagues (2013) – which actually led to even lower estimates of
parental wealth homogamy. However, remaining differences include the use of registry data
instead of survey data and the study of unions in the year of formation rather than a crosssectional selection of unions intact at a given point in time. More research is needed to
understand whether the different types of data and empirical strategies employed affect
results or not. Nevertheless, the take-away from our analysis remains that parental wealth
homogamy in Denmark appears considerably lower than in the US.
However, even if levels of parental wealth homogamy are relatively low, this does not mean
that assortative mating based on parental wealth is of little concern. Firstly, we found parental
wealth homogamy to be particularly strong among partners from the wealthiest families.
Around half of total household wealth is owned by the top 10% wealthiest households, and

30

around one-fifth of total household wealth is owned by the top 1% of households (Jakobsen
et al. 2018). A concentration of parental wealth homogamy at the top can be consequential
for intergenerational wealth inequality, even if parental wealth homogamy is relatively low
for the parental wealth distribution overall. Future research should further explore how
consequential patterns of assortative mating based on parental wealth are for the distribution
and transmission of wealth across households.
Secondly, even though levels of parental wealth homogamy were relatively low in the early
1990s in Denmark, our results indicate a modest but steady increase in homogamy during the
late 1990s and the 2000s. Our preferred estimates suggest such an increase and show a
strengthening of homogamy tendencies among the very wealthy combined with a decreasing
likelihood of these individuals from very wealthy families to partner with those from families
with low wealth. These developments might lead to increasing social distances between the
very wealthy (e.g. the “one per-cent”) and those with little wealth in society.
A main question for future research is: Why is parental wealth homogamy increasing over
time in Denmark? Our analysis provides some starting points for future research on the
mechanisms at play. Additional analysis suggested that the increases in homogamy observed
for the 2000s are not necessarily driven by changes in partner selection. Instead, periodic
changes in the distribution of wealth appear to benefit or penalize certain groups in society in
such ways that if the parental wealth rank of a given individual goes up, the parents of that
same individual’s partner are likely to go up in the wealth ranking too. An example of such a
process would be geographically selective increases in housing prices. For instance, if
housing values surged in Copenhagen during the 2000s, and less so in other parts of
Denmark, individuals with parents who live in Copenhagen (or with parents who have real
estate there) will have experienced increases in their parental wealth rank over time. If there
is a certain level of partnering homogamy based on parents’ place of residence, such selective
31

surges in housing prices will drive up parental wealth homogamy, even if partnering behavior
does not change.
Therefore, the increases in parental wealth homogamy in Denmark might be an indication of
selective changes in the distribution of wealth in society rather than changes in partnering
behavior. This does not make the increases in parental wealth homogamy less concerning
from an inequality perspective. Even though partnering behavior might have remained
relatively stable over time, existing homogamy on other unobserved characteristics seems to
lead to an increased concentration of parental wealth within couples under the current
development of the wealth distribution. In other words, partnering has become more
consequential for the distribution of parental wealth across couples over time, with
consequences for the intergenerational transmission of wealth and its concentration in
society. Our recommendation for future research is to investigate whether and which
selective periodic changes in wealth are driving parental wealth homogamy and to quantify
the consequences of parental wealth homogamy for wealth inequality and its transmission
more generally.
Another hint pointing towards the underlying mechanisms comes from the observation that
homogamy based on parental assets has been increasing steadily over time, whereas
homogamy in parental net wealth (including liabilities) fluctuates more. In addition,
homogamy based purely on assets is consistently stronger (See Figure 7). This suggests that
assets may be a better indicator of the social circles and groups that individuals belong to and
interact with than net wealth. For example, it could be that owning a home in a certain
neighborhood conditions social circles. Whether a home is mortgaged or owned outright
might matter relatively less for partnering, conditional on living in that area. In other words,
partner homogamy in parental wealth might to a larger extent be ascribed to how parental
assets structure the opportunities to meet certain partners rather than being a result of explicit
32

preferences for individuals with wealthy parents (Kalmijn, 1998). This opens up interesting
questions for further research on indicators of social stratification.
To sum up our results, this study has shown that parental wealth homogamy in Denmark is
lower than previous research on the US has shown it to be, but disproportionately strong at
the top of the parental wealth distribution, which might be particularly consequential for
wealth inequality across households and intergenerational transmission of wealth.
Furthermore, we provide indications that parental wealth homogamy has been increasing over
time. We thereby shed light on how one of the major processes generating wealth inequality
between households has been evolving. Finally, we think that important insights are to be
gained from a continued study of homogamy in parental wealth as wealth inequality
continues to rise in many places and as we try to understand how social boundaries between
groups co-evolve with inequality trends.

Appendix B. Presence of Parental Identification Numbers and Parents in the Registry
Data
The requirement for inclusion in the sample of our study was the identification of both
parents in the wealth data. Parents were not identified in the data if: 1) Parental identification
numbers were not available that allowed us to link parents to children in the registry data.
Such parental identification numbers were provided for all individuals born after 1960 but
were incomplete for earlier birth cohorts (Boserup et al. 2013). 2) Parents had passed away
before 1980, moved away from Denmark before 1980, or never lived in Denmark. Given that
our information on wealth is available for the period 1980-2013, we do not have information
on parental wealth in such cases.
In this Online Appendix, we present robustness checks that reduced concerns that the
exclusion of these cases affected our conclusions. Figure B1 shows the percentage of unions
formed each year for which we did not identify all four parents in the dataset. The thick blue
line represents the final sample used in the main analysis. The non-identification of parents
can arise due to two main reasons:
1) Parental identification numbers are not available for one of the four parents involved.
The red dashed line indicates the share of cases that has parental id’s available for all
parents. Between 12 and 21 percent of cases do not have parental identification
numbers, and this is relatively stable across calendar time.
2) Parents might have passed away or do not live in Denmark, and we did not manage to
recover information on parental wealth from earlier years. The dashed blue line
indicates cases where parents were not present in the data in the year of union
formation. This applies to a bit less than 20% of the overall sample (the difference
between red and blue dashed lines). Whenever we were able to recover parental
wealth from earlier waves (the last wave both parents were still alive), we pulled this
wealth information forward after normalizing wealth within the distribution of the
original year and included it in our wealth rank at union formation. This applies to
less than 5% of cases. Robustness checks including these cases generated identical
results (Figure 7).

Even though the distribution of cases where parents were not identified is relatively stable
across calendar time, this is not the case once looking at the distribution according to age.
The left panes of Figures B2-B4 show how the availability of parental identification numbers
declines steadily with age. Given that parental identification numbers were available for all
individuals born after 1961 only, the age profile of missing parent id’s changes with calendar
time. Especially in 1987, the start of our observation window, availability of parent id’s
declines steeply with age. Given that the availability of parent IDs drops to practically zero
after age 35, we restricted our sample to unions formed before age 35. Things look a bit
better in 1993, where we also have cases aged 40 with parental identification numbers
available. Robustness checks extending the analysis to unions formed before age 40 (See
Figure A1) should are therefore most reliable from 1993 onward. The changing age profile of
39

missing parental identification numbers might influence our estimates of correlations in
parental wealth across time. If older (or younger) couples are more likely to be homogamous,
their underrepresentation in older cohorts might drive down (or up) the parental wealth
correlation. To check whether this was of concern we re-ran our analysis where we
reweighted couples based on the probability that the couple had all four parent identification
numbers available in the data. This probability was calculated based on the percentage of
individuals of a given birth cohort (by year) that had both parental identification numbers
available. For each union formed, we multiplied the probability of both partners with each
other and divided 1 by that quantity (i.e. 1/(probability male*probability female). These
results were used to reweight the analysis in robustness checks. The second panes of Figures
B1-B4 show how missing parental identification numbers are more equally distributed across
calendar time and age once reweighting. Figure B5 shows how including these weights in our
analysis reproduces our main results of Figure 7 very well.

Online Appendix F. Sensitivity of parental wealth correlations to the time of measurement
Figure F1 presents the analysis scrutinizing the sensitivity of our results to the time at which
parental wealth is measured. The solid line reproduces our original correlations of parental
wealth measured at union formation (as observed in Figure 7 in the paper; normalized by
union cohort only). The long-dashed line displays parental wealth homogamy, but instead of
measuring parental wealth at union formation, parental wealth is measured 5 years before
union formation. If partnering behavior drives trends in parental wealth homogamy, the time
of measurement should not change results and both lines should overlap. Instead, if trends in
parental wealth homogamy are not driven by changes in partnering, but rather by other
processes such as periodic changes in the distribution of wealth in society, measuring parental
wealth five years earlier should lead to a postponement of the trends in parental wealth
homogamy by about five years. The short-dashed line in Figure F1 lags to the original
correlation of parental wealth homogamy measured at union formation by five years. If
changes in the distribution of wealth (or other processes not captured by who partners whom)
do not drive trends in parental wealth homogamy at all, we should observe a postponement of
the time trend by exactly five years (i.e. both dashed lines should overlap).
It can be observed that for parts of the observation period measuring parental wealth five
years before union formation does not change results. These are the decline in parental wealth
homogamy during the early 1990s and the increases in parental asset homogamy during the
2000s (and 2010s). These trends are therefore driven by actual changes in partnering behavior
and robust to the time of measuring parental wealth. For other parts of the observation period,
the time of measurement does have an impact on results. The increases in parental wealth
homogamy observed during the 2000s and the subsequent decline during the crisis or not
robust to the time of measurement. Once measuring parental wealth five years earlier, the
time trend gets postponed by almost exactly 5 years. This suggests that increases in parental
50

wealth homogamy during the 2000s are not driven by changes in partnering behavior but
rather by changes in the distribution of wealth in society. In the discussion of the paper we
give the following example of such a process:
.. periodic changes in the distribution of wealth appear to benefit or penalize certain groups
in society in such ways that if the parental wealth rank of a given individual goes up, the
parents of that same individual’s partner are likely to go up in the wealth ranking too. An
example of such a process would be geographically selective increases in housing prices. For
instance, if housing values surged in Copenhagen during the 2000s, and less so in other parts
of Denmark, individuals with parents who live in Copenhagen (or with parents who have real
estate there) will have experienced increases in their parental wealth rank over time. If there
is a certain level of partnering homogamy based on parents’ place of residence, such
selective surges in housing prices will drive up parental wealth homogamy, even if partnering
behavior does not change.
