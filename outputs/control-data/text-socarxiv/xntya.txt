Abstract
It is increasingly interesting that one of the new focuses of translation studies is the translatability
of the short posts on social media. Research in translating social media posts has recently received
a greater attention among translation studies specialists. This paper looks firstly at Twitter as a
growing social media networking and its language and, secondly, shedding some light on
translation strategies used in translating English tweets into Arabic. Posts on Twitter, ‘tweets,’ by
well-known figures are followed, translated, and reposted in other languages every day. Strategies
used by Arab translators vary depending on the importance of the tweet as well as the ideology of
the translator and the institutions they work for. This paper, therefore, investigates the translation
strategies adopted by the Arab online news agencies, mentioned later, on their web pages in
translating some tweets posted by the American President, Donald Trump in his first month of
presidency. The analysis draws on Vinay and Darbelnet’s (1958/1995) model and Nida’s (1964)
translation strategies.

Introduction
Social media are computer-mediated technologies that allow users to exchange
information, ideas, thoughts, etc., express their feelings towards different topics and/or show their
political opinions. Social media facilitate the online networking by connecting users wherever they
are with each other. Followers from different countries around the globe can see what others write
and post on their timelines. Social media depends entirely on the availability of access to the
internet. They are the search engines that are considered significant factors in speeding up online
news posts and readers finding news stories which increase the readers’ patterns of online news,
(Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010). The social media websites
include Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Viber, WeChat, etc. According to
some sources; (The Economic Times 2010 quoted in Barton and Lee, (2013) as of April 2010;
there is over 100 million registered user accounts had been created on Twitter. Another statistical
study conducted by Newberry (2018) shows that there are more than 330 million active users on
Twitter.
Research in news analysis, in general, is abundant, but research in news and (Twitter)
translation, in particular, remains scant (Conway & Bassnett, 2006; Bielsa & Bassnett, 2009). Jehl
et al., (2012) state that:
Among the various social media platforms, microblogging services such as Twitter have
become popular communication tool. This is due to the easy accessibility of microblogging
platforms via internet or mobile phones and due to the need for a fast mode of
communication, that microblogging satisfies . (p. 410)
Accordingly, Twitter translation has received little attention about Arabic despite the excessive
existence of retweeting and reposting tweets that are originally posted in other languages including
English.
This paper, therefore, intends to investigate the translation techniques used in translating
and reformulating Trump’s tweets in Arabic. It is, therefore, hypothesized that Trump’s tweets are
not translated accurately due to different factors including unfamiliarity of translation techniques,
the unfamiliarity of the symbols used in Twitter, and the translator’s/agency’s ideology. The
approach presented in this paper aims to identify the translation techniques used and the extent to
which the Arab online agencies succeeded in conveying Trump’s tweets to the Arab readers.
Twitter and Its Language
Twitter is one of the widely used social networks in the new millennium used by ordinary
people and politicians alike. It is defined as one of the widespread online news and social
networking platforms where users can post and interact with messages, ‘tweets’, restricted to 140
characters. There are about 500 million tweets are posted everyday by users in more than forty
different languages (Mallek et al., 2017). Twitter messages are short and simultaneous. “Twitter
users form a social network by ‘following’ the updates of other users, either reciprocal or oneway”, Jehl et al. (2012, p. 410). Accordingly, only registered users can post tweets while

unregistered can only read them. Interestingly enough is how rapid and scan-friendly it is: we can
track hundreds of Tweeters and read them every day.
Because of the fact that Twitter allows only 140 characters in each tweet, Twitters tend to
use acronyms, symbols, and abbreviations to save space. Accordingly, they use bro to replace
brother, btw instead of by the way, lol to mean laughing out loud, etc. Table 1 shows the widely
used symbols and their explanations in brief (cf. https://nobullying.com/twitter-symbols/):

Hashtags (#)
Hashtag is probably the most famous of all Twitter symbols. The # sign is
used to identify certain topics, keywords, events or by companies (e.g. #FB)
in every official tweet. It is a link that connects you to other topics or tweets
that mentioned the same keyword.

Cashtags ($)
Caret/hat (^)
Retweet:

Reply:
Favorite:

If you add @ before any username; you can click on it, examine the profile
and any tweet will be sent directly to that user.
It is a clickable ticker symbol $ added to companies’ names (e.g. $FB) so
that users can look up their finances and stocks.
It reflects a tweet sent by an individual representative of a group, an
organization or a company.
Retweet is another popular Twitter symbol. People retweet all the time, from
each other, from celebrities, from famous companies and brands.
This is a method of communicating with a fellow Twitter user without using
the @ symbol.
To retweet or to favorite that is the question. Most people do not understand
the difference between favoring a tweet and retweeting it. Also many Twitter
users are curious as to the significance of these two symbols.

Vinay and Darbelnet’s Translation Strategies
Translation strategies are defined as the procedures that lead to the optimal solutions of
translation problems (Krings, 1986; Lorscher, 1991). Vinay and Darbelnet (1958/1995), who
carried out a comparative stylistic analysis of French and English looking at texts in both
languages, suggested various translation procedures. These procedures are not only used to solve
translation problems in French-English translation but also applicable when translating between

other languages. They (1995) identify two general translation strategies: direct translation and
oblique translation. Each of which comprises some procedures: direct translation (borrowing,
calque, and literal translation) and oblique translation (transposition, modulation, equivalence, and
adaptation). The following is a discussion of each procedure along with English-Arabic examples:
1. Direct Translation Procedures:
A) Borrowing: borrowing is referred to when a source language (SL) word or phrase is
directly transferred to the target language (TL). This word or phrase is used in a
naturalized form, i.e. to suit the pronunciation and grammatical rules of the TL. Examples
of English words borrowed in Arabic include video ‫فيديو‬, tennis ‫التنس‬, and cafeteria ‫;كافيتريا‬
and Arabic words borrowed in English ‫ زكاة‬Zakat, ‫ حالل‬Halal, ‫ انتفاضة‬Intifada, etc.
B) Calque: calque is a special kind of borrowing where the SL expression is transferred
literally into the TL. Newmark (1988) calls this procedure through-translation, e.g., play
with fire ‫يلعب بالنار‬. In addition, calque is widely used by translators in translating the
names of international organizations. Calque TL expression concerns the imitation of the
SL manner of expression. For example, play a role ‫يلعب دورا‬, North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) ‫منظمة حلف الشمال األطلسي‬, Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)
‫منظمة األغذية والزراعة‬, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) ‫منظمة األمم المتحدة للتربية والثقافة والعلوم‬.
C) Literal Translation: Literal translation is a word-for-word translation described by
Vinay and Darbelnet (1995) as being most common when translating between languages
that belong to the same family and culture. They argue that “literalness should only be
sacrificed because of structural and metalinguistic requirements and only after checking
that the meaning is fully preserved.” However, Munday (2001, p. 57) states that literal
translation might “be unacceptable because it: (a) gives a different meaning; (b) has no
meaning; (c) is impossible for structural reasons; (d) ‘does not have a corresponding
expression within the metalinguistic experience of the TL’; (e) corresponds to something
at a different level of language.” It is usually used with simple structures when translating
from English into Arabic, as in Smith went to school yesterday ‫ذهب سميث إلى المدرسة أمس‬,
John likes football ‫جون يحب كرة القدم‬.
2. Oblique Translation Procedures
A) Transposition: Transposition is a translation procedure that is used when changing
one part of speech for another without changing the tense (Vinay& Darbelnet, 1995).
Transposition is a strategy sometimes used for stylistic reasons and “simply shows a
very good command of the target language,” (Vinay& Darbelnet, 1995). It works in
different ways such as (a) singular to plural, e.g., car manufacturing ‫( ;صناعة السيارات‬b)
verb to noun, e.g., Jack likes to cook on Sunday ‫( ;يحب جاك الطبخ يوم األحد‬c) verb to noun,
e.g., To free a slave ‫تحرير رقبة‬

Zagood

B) Modulation: Modulation changes the view point of the SL. Vinay and Darbelnet
(1995, p. 246) state that modulation is “the touch stone of a good translator”.
Modulation is subdivided into different categories such as (a) active for passive, e.g.,
it was revealed by the BBC reporter that… ‫( ;كشف مراسل قناة البي بي سي أن‬b) positive for
double negative, e.g., we have time for negotiations, but it is not unlimited ‫لدينا وقت‬
‫( ;للمفاوضات إال أنه محدود‬c) cause for effect, e.g., he was obeyed ‫( كان يفرض الطاعة‬d) part
for whole, e.g., the village will establish a new school next year ‫سيفتتح سكان القرية مدرسة‬
‫جديدة السنة المقبلة‬.
C) Equivalence: Equivalence is used to “refer to cases where languages describe the same
situation by different stylistic or structural means” (Munday, 2001, p. 58). It is very
useful in translating non-literal semantic features such as idioms and proverbs as in, as
white as snow ‫ ;أبيض كالحليب‬he got nothing at the end ‫عاد بخفي حنين‬.
D) Adaptation: Adaptation involves a change in the cultural reference when a specific
situation in a language does not exist in another, e.g. as rich as Croesus ‫يملك مال قارون‬.
Nida’s Proposed Strategies
Nida (1964) proposes three translation strategies: addition, subtraction, and alteration.
These strategies are used to adjust the form of the message to the characteristics of the structure of
the target language; to produce semantically equivalent structures; to generate appropriate stylistic
equivalences; and/or to produce an equivalent communicative effect, (Molina & Albir, 2002).
These strategies are defined and exemplified as follows:
a) Addition: Nida lists different circumstances that might oblige a translator to make an
addition: to clarify an elliptic expression, to avoid ambiguity in the target language, to
change a grammatical category (transposition), to amplify implicit elements, and/or to add
connectors.
Three British soldiers are reportedly killed yesterday by Taliban in Afghanistan, the BBC
has learnt.
‫علمت قناة البي بي سي أن مسلحي حركة طالبان اإلسالمية قد قتلوا ثالثة جنود بريطانيين يوم أمس في أفغانستان‬
The above example shows two additions: ‫ مسلحي حركة طالبان اإلسالمية‬and ‫قناة‬. These two additions do
not change the meaning but they do clarify it. Accordingly, translation by addition is a useful
technique but it should be used properly, (Zagood, 2014).
b) Subtraction: Nida lists four situations where the translator should use this procedure, in
addition to when it is required by the TL: unnecessary repetition, specified references,
conjunctions and adverbs. For example, the name of God appears thirty-two times in the
thirty-one verses of Genesis. Nida suggests using pronouns or omitting God.
c) Alteration: some changes are needed especially where there is incompatibility between
the two languages. Alteration as a translation technique includes

1) Changes due to the problems caused by transliteration when a new word is introduced
from the source language.
2) Changes due to the structural differences between the two languages, changes in the
word order and/or grammatical categories are good examples.
3) Changes due to semantic misfits, especially with idiomatic expressions. (Molina &
Albir, 2002).
Research Methodology
This section presents the selection and justification for the choice of data used in this study.
As well known, one of the controversial public politicians who always tweets are the American
President, Donald Trump. He sometimes tweets on controversial topics and presidential decrees.
These tweets are translated and reposted in other languages including Arabic. Translators use
different translation strategies to convey the intended meanings of Trump’s tweets to other
languages. This paper investigates and analyzes the strategies used in translating Trump’s tweets
into Arabic. The translations to be analyzed are selected randomly from different Arab online news
agencies.
Therefore, to collect data for this study, eight of Trump’s tweets during his first month of
the presidency, January 19th, 2017 to February 20th, 2017, were randomly selected. Two Arabic
translations for each of the selected tweets were also chosen randomly from the Arab online media,
to see how the Arab media conveys Trump’s ideas to the Arab readers. A comparison between the
two translations of each tweet is undertaken to see if there is a difference in meaning between the
two translations. In addition, an analysis of the translation strategies adopted in each translation is
also conducted to see how Arab translators use the translation strategies suggested by Vinay and
Darbelnet (1958/1995) and Nida (1964).
The reason for choosing Trump’s tweets for analysis is due to his controversial character
as well as being chosen as the TIME’s person of the year 2016 (Time, 2016); and above all, being
the president of the US. Furthermore, Vinay and Darbelnet (1958/1995) and Nida (1964) suggest
different translation strategies so that translators find them useful when transferring the message
from one language to another. Therefore, eight of Trump’s tweets have been chosen to see how
they were translated into Arabic, and how helpful Vinay and Darbelnet’s model and Nida’s
proposed strategies are. The analysis would be through tabulating each tweet along with its two
translations in order to investigate the degree of equivalency and to which extent Vinay and
Darbelnet’s and Nida’s strategies were adopted and succeeded in conveying the meaning.
Accordingly, the methodology presents the translation techniques and procedures in light of the
theoretical framework set in the previous sections.
Analysis of the Study Data
As it was mentioned earlier, the analysis in this section is based on Vinay and Darbelnet’s
and Nida’s translation strategies. It is shown from the above-mentioned examples that the proposed
strategies are used in translation irrespective of the two languages in question. The qualitative
approach is used in analyzing the data collected. The analysis consists of tabulating each tweet

along with its two translations. The table is followed by an analysis of the two translations.
Williams and Chesterman (2007, p. 7) state that “the analysis of translated texts involves a textual
comparison of a translation with its original.” The analysis below shows to what extent Vinay and
Darbelnet’s and Nida’s strategies were used appropriately in translating Trump’s tweets into
Arabic. Thus, the following is the analysis of the randomly selected tweets and their translations
from randomly selected Arab online news websites:
Table 2: Tweet one posted on Feb 7 , 2017

‫ ال‬- ‫ األولى في اإلرهاب‬- ‫صفقات مع إيران‬
)‫"! (مصر العربية‬.‫مشكلة‬

The tweet above carries two main ideas: Trump’s negation of having dealt with Russia,
and the irony in his reference to the nuclear agreement with Iran.
In the first translation, Nida’s subtraction (omission) was adopted in two cases: and the
haters are going crazy and #1 in terror. Both subtractions could not be accepted because they
affect the meaning in the sense that the irony is ignored as well as neglecting Trump’s view of
Iran. Such subtraction might also be attributed to the translator’s (agency’s) ideology, (cf. Venuti,
2008; Lopez & Caro, 2014; and Ethelb, 2016). In the second translation, in contrast, these two
phrases were translated into ‫ الكارهين أصيبوا بالجنون‬and ‫إيران األولى في اإلرهاب‬.

In this tweet, Trump accuses the negative polls on some TV channels of being fake insisting
on the people’s need for security on the borders and the extreme vetting.
In both translations, the acronymic names of the TV channels (CNN, ABC, NBC) were
transliterated in Arabic but they were transliterated differently (‫السى إن إن‬, ‫إيه بى سى‬, ‫ان بى سى‬,) and
(‫سي إن إن‬, ‫إيه بي سي‬, ‫)إن بي سي‬. In the second translation, there was also a use of addition where ‫وسائل‬
‫ اإلعالم الليبرالية المعادية له‬is added. This addition claims that such TV channels were hostile to Trump.

However, no clear indication in the tweet for such claim unless the translator brings this
information from other resources.

This tweet shows Trumps view on the case raised to the court regarding the ban of seven
countries’ nationals from entering the US.
In the first translation, ‫ أي ترامب نفسه‬was unnecessarily added. This addition reflects the
translator’s belief that the case represents Trump alone not US as a country. In both translations,
as it so obviously should and politics were not translated.

In this tweet, Trump warns that many bad and dangerous people may enter the US if the
ban is lifted and describes the decision of being terrible.
The literal translation was used in the first translation transferring the meaning literally to
the target language, Arabic. In the first translation; the translator, influenced by the SL (English),
used an exotic phrase ‫ من قبل‬which is not preferable in Arabic. In the second translation, modulation
and free translation strategies were also used. However, there is some kind of ambiguity in the
target text: it is unclear to whom/what the resumptive pronoun ‫ ه‬in ‫ فلوموه‬refers to, i.e. what the
antecedent of this pronoun is.

In this tweet, Trump stresses the need for extreme vetting on the US borders and refers to
what happens in Europe and elsewhere in the world.
In both translations, the translators divided this tweet into two quotes each adding ‫و أضاف‬
‫ ترامب‬and ‫الفتا إلى أنه‬. In the second translation only, subtraction is used when a horrible mess is
omitted. Accordingly, both addition and subtraction were used.

In this tweet, Trump warns Iran of producing nuclear weapons saying that they are playing
with the fire and he is not going to deal with them kindly as Obama did.
In both translations, calque is used in translating playing with fire as this idiom is used in
both languages meaning that someone is doing something dangerous. In the second translation,
the statement is divided to smaller units adding some expressions (‫ وتابع ترمب‬and ‫وختم ترمب تغريدته‬

In both translations, the word ‫ جامعة‬is added so that all readers understand what Berkeley
is. This addition is needed in such context as not all readers know that Berkeley is a university. In
the second translation, no federal funds is translated literally with borrowing federal in Arabic
resulting ‫ ال األموال الفيدرالية‬which is unclear.

In this tweet, Trump criticizes the judicial system in the country saying it is broken as it
allows the citizens from the seven suspect countries to enter into U.S.
In the first translation, both addition and literal translation techniques were used. Phrases
like ‫ و أضاف ترامب‬and ‫ مشيرا إلى أن ذلك األمر‬were added. Legal system is broken was literally
translated. In the second translation, both addition and subtraction were used. ‫ و أضاف‬was added
while since travel reprieve hail was omitted.
Findings
Having compared the Arabic translations of Trump’s tweets and analyzed them, the
following are some findings:
1. Trump’s tweets are translated and reposted in many Arab online media websites.
2. Arab translators use various translation strategies including Vinay and Darbelnet’s
(1958/1995) and Nida’s (1964) proposed techniques to convey Trump’s tweets to Arab
readers.
3. Some translation techniques were correctly used while others were not.
4. Nida’s additions and subtractions were the widely used strategies to convey the meaning
and overcome the gaps between the two languages.
5. In some translations, phrases were deleted because of misunderstanding of the symbols
used in twitter or because of the translator’s/agency’s ideology.
6. There was some sort of negative transfer between the two languages.
Conclusion
This paper looked at Twitter as a widely growing social media network used by ordinary
people and politicians alike. It shed some light on the language and symbols used in tweets. It

An Analytical Study of the Strategies Used in Translating Trump's Tweets

mainly aimed at comparing and investigating the translations of some of Trump’s tweets into
Arabic. It also aimed to see how Arab news agencies convey Trump’s tweets to the Arab reader.
To reach this end, eight of Trump’s tweets at his first month of presidency along with two Arabic
translations for each tweet in some Arab online news agencies have been randomly selected for
comparison and analysis.
The analysis showed that Trump’s tweets are translated and reposted every day in the Arab
online news websites. Translators use different translation strategies to convey the tweets’
meanings to Arab readers. Some strategies were used appropriately while others were not. Thus,
unsurprisingly, the results of this study corroborate the postulated hypothesis and provide clear
evidence that the Arabic translations of some tweets in some Arab online news agencies are to a
certain extent inaccurate. Such inaccuracy is attributed to the misunderstanding of some symbols
used in Twitter, disuse of translation strategies, and translator’s/news agency’s ideologies.
