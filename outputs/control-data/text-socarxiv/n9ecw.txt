The production of materials is widely recognized to be an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions1–4 and a range of policy processes now aim at enhancing material efficiency5–7 and circular
economy.8–10 Yet, our understanding of the dynamics and drivers of material‐related GHG emissions is
limited. Previous analyses did not cover all materials and neither did they address the use of the
materials nor their enabling of final consumption.2,11 Here, the hypothetical extraction method is used
to quantify the GHG emissions from material production in a multiregional input‐output model of the
global economy12 and to trace the carbon footprint of materials from production through their first
use to final consumption. GHG emissions from material production increased by 120% in the period
1995–2015 to 11 Gt CO2e, rising from 15 to 23% of global emissions. China accounted for 75% of the
growth. Capital formation drives two thirds of emissions. Two fifths of materials in terms of GHG are
used in construction, and two fifths are used in the manufacturing of machinery, vehicles, and other
durable products. Policies addressing the rapidly growing capital stocks in emerging economies hence
offer the best prospect for emission reductions from material efficiency.

It is now widely acknowledged that material production causes over half of GHG emissions from
industry1–4 and that material efficiency5–7 and the circular economy8–10 are important strategies to
reduce those emissions. The International Energy Agency2,13 traces energy use and direct emissions from
production processes of high‐volume materials—iron and steel, cement, chemicals and petrochemicals,
aluminium, and pulp and paper. Not all materials are covered, emissions associated with non‐energy
inputs are ignored, and there is little information on the use of materials in the economy.11 Individual
technology case studies, for example, of buildings, infrastructure, and vehicles, show an important
contribution of materials to the life‐cycle impact of those systems and indicate potential synergies and
trade‐offs between energy and material efficiencies.4,14 The lack of a comprehensive understanding may
impair the development of material efficiency or circular‐economy strategies for climate‐change
mitigation11.

Here, I present a first analysis of the contribution of material production to the carbon footprint of
products and final consumption between 1995 and 2015, analyze the use of materials by downstream
fabrication and manufacturing processes, and quantify the global GHG emissions in the production of
materials by type of material. On the basis of the system of national economic and environmental
accounts, data on economic activity, energy and material conversion and use, and resulting emissions,
researchers recently produced time series of multiregional input‐output (MRIO) tables.12,15,16 I used the
method of hypothetical extraction (HEM)17,18 to identify the contribution of materials in the upstream

and downstream emission accounts of a global MRIO. The applicability of HEM to global MRIO tables has
not been universally recognized.19 In the section Methods and Data, I show that HEM is indeed
applicable to global models and I provide a mathematical derivation of the determination of materials’
contribution to the footprint of other products and final consumption. The assessment highlights the
important contribution of materials that constitute the capital stock—machinery, factories, and
warehouses—to the carbon footprint of produced products and delivered services, on the basis of a
recently developed dataset for the endogenization of the consumption of fixed capital.20 Finally, the
investigation of different final‐demand categories shows that capital formation is a more important
final‐demand driver than household or government consumption.

In conventional footprint analysis, double counting is a serious issue that impacts the usefulness of
previous analyses, in particular for assessing the potential contribution of material efficiency to lowering
the carbon footprint of products.21,22 A recent proposal for correcting such double counting was
developed in the process of quantifying the carbon footprint of Japan’s material use23,24 and was
extended to analyze the environmental and employment impacts of global supply chains.25 The present
paper provides an independent derivation of the suggested method23,25 to correct for double counting
and extends it to downstream impacts. Following the material efficiency literature,1–6 this manuscript
addresses structural and functional materials used to compose products and excludes foodstuff, fuels,
and chemicals.

GHG emissions from material production increased by 120% from 5 Gt CO2e in 1995 to 11Gt in 2015,
raising their share of the global total from 15 to 23% (Fig. 1A). Iron and steel production caused 3.6 Gt
CO2e in 2011, the year with the most reliable data. When corrected for the use of materials in the
production of other materials, this amounted to 31% (3.3 Gt) of all emissions caused by material
production (Fig.1B, Table 1). The next most important contributions were from cement, lime, and
plaster production with 24% and rubber and plastics including basic plastics with 13%. Non‐ferrous
metals contributed 10%, and non‐metallic mineral products contributed 14%, with glass alone
contributing 4%. Ignoring land‐use‐related emissions, including deforestation, pulp, paper, and wood
products, caused a total of 1 Gt (9%). Of these materials, the largest growth in emissions was associated
with glass; sand and clay; iron and steel; cement, lime and plaster; lead, zinc, and tin; and other non‐
ferrous metal products, which all increased by 160–170% in the period 1995–2015. The smallest growth
was associated with paper, pulp, and wood products, stone, copper, and precious metals, but of all
materials, only paper increased by less than the total global GHG emissions, 49%.26

In 2011, GHG emissions from the production of materials were 10.8 GtCO2e. Of these emissions, 86%
were CO2, and the remainder was mostly methane associated with energy supply. Direct emissions from
material‐producing sectors constituted 53% of the cradle‐to‐gate emissions of the materials (Fig. 1A), a
share that varied from 84% for cement to 11% for aluminium (Table 1a). Energy supply to material
production and other upstream activities contributed 35% of the total, mining 2%, and other inputs
10%. Emissions associated with the production of fuel and electricity used in mining and of other inputs
were counted as energy‐sector emissions. If upstream energy were allocated to mining and other inputs,
these would contribute 3 and 36% of emissions, respectively, emphasizing the importance of a life‐cycle
perspective when determining the emissions of material production.

The largest carbon footprints of materials in downstream production were those of cement, lime, and
plaster in construction (2.5 GtCO2e in 2011) and of iron and steel used in manufacturing (2.4 Gt).
Building and construction was the top designation for other non‐metallic minerals including glass, wood,
and lead, zinc, and tin (Table 1b). Manufacturing was the top destination for rubber and plastics,
aluminium, copper, precious metals, and other non‐ferrous metals.

A more detailed breakdown reveals that iron and steel were used primarily in construction (0.75 Gt
CO2e), in the production of machinery (1.1 Gt), for fabricated metal products (0.6 Gt), for motor vehicles
(0.4 Gt), and for other transport equipment (0.2 Gt). Basic plastics corresponding to 0.5 GtCO2e were
used in the production of rubber and plastics. Rubber and plastics were used in machinery, motor
vehicle and other transport equipment, and final demand (ca. 0.2 Gt each).

When looking at the share of materials in the total carbon footprint of products delivered by different
sectors of the economy, materials contributed 70% to the carbon footprint of construction (Table 2).
High fractions were also obtained for electrical machinery and equipment (64%), machinery (60%), and
other transport equipment (58%). Materials contributed 56% of the carbon footprint of vehicle
production. Surprisingly, materials were important for the carbon footprint of some services,
contributing 43% to real estate services, 37% to computer services, 34% to post and
telecommunications, and 23% to recreational, cultural, and sporting organizations. For services, the use
of buildings, equipment, and other capital goods were important channels for materials to contribute to
carbon footprints. For example, materials in capital good contributed only 9% to the carbon footprint of
construction but 27% to the footprint of post and telecommunications (Table 2). Table 2 contains a
weighted global average multiplier of aggregated products, the share of direct emissions, and material
and non‐material inputs, identified as intermediate or capital inputs.

The immediate demand of materials is often to produce semi‐finished products and capital goods, which
are then used further to produce consumer goods or services. The material‐related footprint of the final
demand for services, of the final demand for manufactured products, and of the net investment in
additional buildings and infrastructure are 3GtCO2e each (Fig. 2C,D). For services, material‐intensive
capital goods such as buildings and vehicles are more important than the intermediate input of
materials to service production, as Table 2 shows. The final demand for food (0.6 Gt), energy (0.2 Gt),
and transport services (0.2 Gt) was less important. Construction and machinery dominate investments,
followed by vehicles and electronics. In consumption, services have grown to be important, especially
public administration, health, and education.

The contribution of materials to the carbon footprint of consumption (and changes in stock and
valuables) grew from 4.1 to 7.3 GtCO2e in the period 1995–2015, whereas their share in net investment
grew fourfold from 1.0 to 4.2 Gt. Reinvestment, that is, the production of capital goods required to
replace existing capital being depreciated in the production of goods, doubled from 2.5 to 5.2 Gt. The
ratio of material use for gross‐fixed‐capital formation to that for consumption grew from 0.87 in 1995 to
1.3 in 2015 (Fig. S3). If capital use is not endogenized, two thirds of the carbon footprint of materials is
driven by gross fixed capital formation. Much of the increase in the total carbon footprint of materials is
hence connected to a growth of net investment and the increasing importance of capital to industrial
production.

In 2015, China accounted for slightly more than half of the emissions related to material production (Fig.
2A,B). It quadrupled emissions, while India and Brazil almost tripled emissions. At the same time, the
emissions in Canada, the European Union, Russia, and the United States declined by up to one quarter.
When looking at the materials’ contribution to the carbon footprint of countries, only Russia saw a
significant decrease, the EU saw a slight decrease (‐4%), Canada saw an increase by 30%, and the US saw
an increase by 9% (Fig. S2). As these post‐industrial economies started importing more manufactured
products, they also outsourced material production, primarily to China. Net imports constituted one
third of the material‐related carbon footprint of the EU; net exports amounted to 13% of China’s
material‐related emissions and 18% of the emissions from the BRITS (Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey,
South Africa).

Three quarters of the dramatic increase in emissions happened in China. China’s net exports rose
moderately from 0.3 to 0.6 Gt and hence do not explain this rise. Instead, it is China’s investment‐driven
development that serves as explanation for this rapid rise: residential floor space increased from 10 to
30 m2 per person,27 and China built a first‐rate high‐speed rail network and constructed many roads,
bridges, ports, and factories. Extending building lifetimes from 23 years to a more normal 60 years,28
stopping building unoccupied flats,29 and shifting from construction and heavy industry to services30 can
dramatically reduce material demand and its associated emissions. Light‐weight designs31 and low‐
carbon materials32 offer GHG mitigation options for countries entering phases of rapid development,
and improvements in reuse and recycling of materials have the largest applicability in developed
economies, which have the largest stocks of manufactured capital.33

The high investment rate in China may already be decreasing, and there is an indication that production
volumes of metal products have recently declined, those of cement have stabilized, and production is
becoming more efficient.30 The overarching importance of the role of investment confirms Müller et
al.’s33 notion of infrastructure and durable goods as the main driver of material consumption and related
GHG emissions, although the current analysis also shows that the stock is not necessarily static and that
consumption still plays an important role. Similar build‐ups of structures, transport systems, and
factories are foreseeable in regions such as India and sub‐Saharan Africa, where population growth is
still rapid, and urbanization is at an earlier stage. Finding ways to urbanize and develop in a manner that
relies on less materials and building lighter structures and collective transportation systems are
potential approaches to reduce the material stock required for a modern society.34

Methods and Data
Method choice. The present work utilizes input‐output methods which have long been used to describe
economic relations among sectors of the economy and have recently been shown to be useful for
environmental analysis, especially when national tables are combined with trade data to construct a
global table and when complemented by emission and resource‐consumption data. Such multiregional
input‐output tables are now the preferred tools for material,35,36 carbon,37 and other footprinting.16
Alternatively, life‐cycle inventory data could be combined with material‐consumption statistics to
provide information on the impacts of various materials, as it has been done for the global use of
metals.38,39 Such an analysis could correct for double counting, and with material‐flow analysis, it could
be extended to the use of materials. It would be difficult to address the materials’ contribution to the
carbon footprints of final or materials’ share of emissions in the carbon footprint of other products.

Data and scope. The modeling is based on version 3.6 of the EXIOBASE multiregional input‐output
(MRIO) database,12 in which different materials were detailed on the basis of data from mineral
statistics40,41 and IEA energy statistics.42 EXIOBASE 3.6 represents the world economy in 43 individual
territories and 6 aggregated regions. CO2 emissions from the combustion and industrial processes such
as iron and clinker production, methane emissions from agriculture and the energy system, and nitrous‐
oxide emissions from agriculture are the most important sources of GHG emissions. Emissions from
land‐use change were not included, because they cannot be clearly allocated to a specific production
activity, and CO2 absorption in the growth of wood or through the carbonation of cement was ignored.43
These omissions result in potential errors connected to wood, pulp, and paper and an overestimate of
the climate impact of cement and plaster.

The production and the consumption of up to 200 products are modeled in each region, including the
following materials: Iron and steel; Aluminium; Copper; Precious metals; Lead, zinc and tin; Other non‐
ferrous metals; Cement, lime, plaster; Stone; Sand and clay; Other non‐metallic minerals; Glass; Wood;
Pulp; Paper; Rubber and plastic, Basic plastics. Note that this is a product‐by‐product table; therefore,
inputs are to production processes, not economic sectors. The material‐efficiency work by the IEA,13 by
comparison, addresses iron and steel, aluminium, cement, pulp and paper, and chemicals. It specifies
energy use but does not quantify related or other upstream emissions. Other MRIO tables do not offer
the level of detail on different materials presented here, and plastics are commonly grouped with other
chemicals. Further, data on the consumption of capital are not available, making it impossible to carry
out the modelling presented here without more data development.

Endogenization of capital. The use of capital goods such as machinery, buildings, and vehicles in the
production of goods and services was included in the carbon‐footprint assessment by using the
approach and data in Södersten et al.20 In this methodology, the consumption of fixed capital is treated as
an input to production, with the required material demands, whereas the gross fixed capital formation,
which normally is treated as a category of final demand, is replaced by the net fixed capital formation,
reflecting only the investment above the consumption of fixed capital, which can be seen as expanding
production capacity. In this manner, the carbon footprint of a product includes the emissions associated
with producing the machinery used in the product’s production. The annual table is still balanced and
reflects the annual emissions, including those of material production. However, the disadvantage of this
approach is that the technology assumed to be used for producing the capital goods is the current
technology, their “carbon replacement value,”33 and not the likely higher historical costs. Alternative
approaches in which emissions associated with current capital formation are allocated to future years of
capital utilization could remedy this problem44 but do not yet offer the same capital product detail
utilized here. To investigate the importance of gross fixed capital formation, the carbon footprint of
gross fixed capital is also calculated (Fig. S3), with the total material‐related carbon footprint of final
consumption plus investment covering emissions from material production in that year plus a
representation of emissions of the previous years associated with the capital consumed in the
production of materials in the given year.

Input‐output methods. In an input‐output table, the matrix A of input coefficients describes the
technology of the economy, with each column representing the requirement of intermediate inputs
required to produce a unit output of a product. The matrix Y represents the final demand for products,
and the vector x represents the production volume. The market balance in a closed or global economy
shows that the total output needs to satisfy both the required intermediate inputs and the final

consumption, 𝐴𝑥 𝑌𝑖 𝑥 , where i is a vector of ones that sums over the preceding matrix. This system
of linear equations written in matrix notation can be solved for the total production volume, yielding the
Leontief demand‐pull model, 𝑥
𝐼 𝐴 𝑦 𝐿𝑦, where y is an arbitrary unit of final demand. L is the
Leontief inverse, which specifies the production volumes per unit final demand from each sector.

212
213
214
215
216
217

The matrix or row vector 𝜋 represents the input of production factors (or value added), such as capital,
labour, and land, to produce a unit output in each sector. Together, A and 𝜋 represent the technology of
the economy. The firm or production balance indicates that the price of each product is the sum of the
costs of intermediate inputs and the costs of factor inputs, or the value added, per unit output. Writing
this for each production process gives 𝑝𝐴 𝜋 𝑝. Solving for the price of goods, we obtain the Leontief
price model, 𝑝 𝜋 𝐼 𝐴
𝜋𝐿.

The emissions per unit output are contained in the matrix S (one line per pollutant) and are weighted
with the characterization vector c of 100‐year global‐warming potentials to obtain CO2 equivalent. The
Leontief demand‐pull model can be used to calculate the carbon‐footprint multiplier, that is, the cradle‐
to‐gate GHG emissions to produce one unit of each product, 𝑀 𝑐𝑆𝐿 . Note the similarity between the
multiplier for emissions and the price. The total carbon footprint of a final consumption basket y is given
by 𝐸 𝑐𝑆𝐿𝑦. If y only describes final consumption, there is no double counting, because all emissions
are allocated to final consumption.

This Leontief demand approach to the quantification of the cradle‐to‐gate environmental impacts and
carbon footprints is widely accepted and can be applied to any final product.15,16 It could, in principle,
also be applied to the materials in question. However, materials are required to produce materials. In
fact, there is very little final demand for materials; the final demand is for products, including machinery
and structures, made from materials and services created with the help of these products. Accounting
only for materials purchased by final consumers would grossly underestimate the importance of
materials for GHG emissions. An application of the total Leontief multiplier to gross output (i.e., total
material production) does not yield the proper total environmental impacts22 because of double
counting.21,22 The hypothetical extraction method (HEM)17,45,46 offers a way in which the economy‐wide
impact of material production can be estimated exactly while avoiding double counting. It does so by
quantifying the production volumes and emissions not related to material production and by identifying
the production activities and emissions related to materials as the remainder.

HEM is used in regional and structural economics to study forward and backward linkages among
sectors, as well as the potential economic consequences of disasters and acts of terror.17,18,45,47 Recently,
Dietzenbacher, von Burken, and Kondo19 argued that HEM cannot be used in global models, because the
extracted product is often seen as being imported (e.g., see Duarte et al.18 and He et al.47 as well as Fig.
S4), and there is no place from which to import in a global model. The following section shows that HEM
can be applied broadly to any system for which the basic input‐output accounting identities and Leontief
production functions hold. The extraction of a sector is only hypothetical and provides an identification
of relationships within the input‐output table. By implication, it also applies to global and multiregional
models, where any number of production processes, individual inputs, or a fraction thereof can be
extracted.

Hypothetical extraction method. We would like to understand the use of various production processes
in the economy required to provide a specific product, or group of products, signified by o, as well as the
use of factors in the production of those goods, and the share of the cost/factors of producing o in the

price/factor requirements of other goods. Imagine now that we engage in an experiment where we
trace the expenditure on o through the value chain by splitting the input‐output description of the
economy into two additive parts: one describing the complete production of intermediate and final
demand for products o, including the production of products * serving as intermediate input to the
production of o and the other describing the final demand for the remaining products * (Fig. S4),

The Hypothetical Extraction theorem says that the output required to satisfy the intermediate and final

extracted.

and the two solutions can be shown to be equivalent because 𝐿𝐴 𝐿∗ 𝐿 𝐿∗ . The identification of the
production volume of extracted materials through eq. 4 corresponds to the identification of sectors by
Cabernard et al.25 based on the work of Dente et al.23 It can be seen from eq. 3 that HEM avoids double
counting.

The production balance can be used to identify the contribution of the extracted products to the price of
the non‐extracted products (Fig. S4).

Here, the second term of the right‐hand side of Leontief price model in eq. 5b represents the value

be treated in the same manner as the value added, the carbon footprint of material production in other

To determine the total emissions associated with the production of extracted inputs, there are now two
ways of calculating those. One is simply to multiply the production volume required to produce the
extracted product by the respective factor coefficients.

Here, the entire production of material(s) j was extracted by setting all intermediate and final demand
for both domestically produced and imported inputs to other sectors and the final demand to zero
(𝐴∗,. 0; 𝑌 ∗,. 0 . As Dietzenbacher and Lahr17 have shown, it is not necessary to set cells to zero,
through partial extraction; one can also set them to a different value. One can also extract only a single
input, such as the use of steel in the automotive industry, as long as eq. 1 holds.

The identification of individual materials. If a single material is extracted, other materials will have been
used in its production, for example, steel and copper in the machinery and cement in the infrastructure.
Some materials are intermediate stages to other materials, such as pulp for paper production. If all
materials are extracted individually, the total emissions obtained by summing over the Eo for all
materials will thus contain double counting. The next paragraph describes a strategy to identify such
interdependencies. To avoid double counting and correctly estimate the emissions associated with each
material going to the production of downstream products and apart from the inputs of other assessed
materials, eq. 9 was used for the case where all materials have been extracted at the same time. The
𝐴 𝑥 ∗ contains non‐zero rows describing the input of materials to downstream processes
matrix 𝑦
unrelated to material production. The row sums thus identify the contribution of each material to the
total carbon footprint of material production. The calculation method implies that emissions during the
production of zinc used as a steel alloy are counted as being part of the carbon footprint of steel, not
that of zinc, and the carbon footprint of zinc is only for zinc used outside material production.

Interdependencies of different materials (Table S1). To determine the use of materials as direct or
indirect inputs in the production of other materials, a single line was added to the extension matrix S for
each material j, being unity for each production process of the respective material and zero otherwise.
With this S, equation (8) then yields the amount 𝜆 of materials i required to produce each individually
extracted material j and 𝜆 is the production volume of material i. Table S1 contains the results for all
materials. It displays interdependencies, such as the use of most pulp for paper production or the use of
nearly half of basic plastics in rubber and plastic production. For most materials, on the order of 10–20%
of the production volume is used in the production of materials.

The analysis was conducted at the country/regional level, with each material being extracted in all
regions at once, and the results were aggregated to the global level.

Uncertainty. The present assessment of the carbon footprint of materials, the use of materials, and the
material‐related component of the carbon footprint relies on a multiregional input‐output table
constructed for this type of analysis. Different MRIO tables have been constructed by using different

principles and data sources, yielding different results in footprint studies.48 Significant sources of
uncertainty are related to the homogeneity of products or sectors and related to that, the aggregation
of products,49 the uncertainty in the emissions data, and the disaggregation of products to different
materials. By using a Monte Carlo analysis of country‐level consumption‐based carbon‐emission
accounts, Rodrigues et al.50 find a coefficient of variation (CV, normalized standard deviation) of 2–16%
across countries. They find much higher product‐level uncertainty ranging from 10 to 200%, depending
on the product. Similar uncertainties apply to the results reported in this manuscript, with higher
relative uncertainties for smaller production volumes. We cannot necessarily assume that the
uncertainties of individual‐country products are independent from each other; there may be issues
associated with the collection of energy‐use data or the disaggregation procedure which afflict all
estimates for a specific material in the same manner.50 Uncertainties for the most recent years are
higher than those up to 2011; indeed, the input‐output tables were detailed on the basis of a set of
assumptions and preliminary data, because final national‐account data were not yet available.
Nuss and Eckelman38 projected the carbon footprint of global metal consumption in 2008 by using life
cycle assessment (LCA) data and global production volumes of metals. They estimated 3.1 Gt CO2e,
compared to 3.7 estimated in this work. The contribution of iron and steel, aluminium, and other metals
was 2.4, 0.4, and 0.3 Gt, respectively, compared to 2.8, 0.5, and 0.4 in the present paper. Although the
widely acknowledged issue of cut‐off errors in LCA would offer a convenient explanation, there can be
many other causes for this discrepancy, and the comparison provides some comfort that the order of
magnitude is correct.

export, followed by Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey, and South Africa (BRITS), while Europe, North America, and recently the
Rest of the World are primary importers.

Fig. S 3: Material‐related GHG emissions connected to gross fixed capital investment (GFCF, red line) surpass those related to
consumption and stock changes in 2003. Investment can be divided in replacement of existing capital stock consumed in a
specific year (consumption of fixed capita, turquoise) and new investment (net formation of capital stock, yellow). The relative
importance of new investment is increasing.

Illustrative results
To more clearly illustrate the methods in this paper, this section provides a step‐by‐step presentation of
illustrative results on a less aggregated bases than the ones presented in the main article. For this
purpose, Germany in 2015 used as a case. I present results for the common classification system used to
compare different MRIO tables49. The results were calculated at the 200‐product level and then
aggregated to this classification system, which distinguishes 17 products.
Emissions by emitting process due to materials production.
Eq.3 allows us to identify the emissions occurring during production activity required to produce
materials. In the results presented here, all material production globally was extracted, which means
that production activities identified in a specific country could support the production of materials in
another countries. Inputs might include mining or other extractive activity, the production of machinery
and equipment, transport of raw materials, or any number of service activities. What we see for
Germany is that emissions directly from the materials producing processes (in this case cement and
plastics, all listed in the petroleum category) and metals make the largest contributions, together with
energy supply and transport. This was used to derived Fig. 1A and Table 1a.

Fig. S 5: Emissions during the production activity in Germany in 2015 associated with the production of materials worldwide.

The contribution of different materials
The emissions associated with materials production can be identified simply as the multiplier of the
material times the volume of material production. This identification ends up with double counting the
materials used for material production. Here, the emissions associated with the demand for materials
for things other than material production are identified using eq. 13 (Fig. S 6). The total is a composite of
direct emissions (identified in the previous step), energy‐related emissions (identified through looking at
18

the energy input to material production processes in A), and the remainder. An alternative way to
identify the emissions by material is to extract each material individually, which was done for the main
article. In all cases, the multiplier of the material itself contains the input of other materials either
directly or through intermediate or capital products. Double counting was avoided by identifying the
volume of material that serves the production of other materials.
In terms of high production volume materials, the situation in Germany is similar to the global situation
(Table 1), with iron and steel, cement, and plastics causing the highest GHG emissions, and direct
emissions being most important for cement and less so for aluminium and plastics.

Fig. S 6: Emissions associated with materials produced in Germany. Direct emissions from material producing processes (scope 1
according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol classification) are in Germany, but those related to the supply of energy (scope 2) and
other inputs (scope 3) occur wherever these inputs are produced.

First use of materials
Emissions associated with material production are then allocated to the first use of the respective
industry sectors by the downstream industries purchasing these materials as intermediate inputs, as
well as to final consumption and export (Fig. S 7). Germany has a large domestic production of materials,
with a lot of export of iron and steel, but it also imports materials especially for manufacturing industries
and to a lesser degree for consumption and construction. As in the global situation, construction is the
most important user of materials apart from exports, followed by transport equipment manufacturing,
consumption (including adjustment of inventory and valuables).

Fig. S 7: GHG emission associated with materials production by the first use of the material in the economy. The figure identifies
materials that are domestically produced (many go to export) and materials imported to be used by various sectors of the
German economy.

Fig. S 8: Heat map of the material‐related portion of the carbon footprint of products used as intermediate inputs by
downstream industries or in final consumption (Consumption, Investment, Export). Please note that investments are net capital
formation and that those investment goods required to produce current output levels are accounted for as intermediate inputs.

Even further downstream, we can identify the contribution of materials to the carbon footprint of
products produced from materials, with the help of materials or capital consisting of materials using eq.
4 and a similar equation for the intermediate demand in downstream industries after extraction of
materials sectors, m 𝑍 ∗ , 𝑌 ∗ . The resulting carbon flow table51 shows that for Germany, the largest flow
of embodied carbon is in the export of vehicles and other transport equipment, and the final
20

consumption of imported products and assorted services. Construction shows up not only as supplying
products to financial intermediation and business activity (which includes real estate services), but also
to public administration and other services, which includes much of commercial buildings. Imports are
important, not surprisingly, for machinery and electrical equipment manufacturing and transport
equipment manufacturing, in addition to net investments.
In Germany, as in other developed economies, net investment plays a relatively small role, and the
replacement of existing capital stock is already included as intermediate input to the production sectors.
The heat map in Fig. S 8 clearly shows that relatively few product groups are responsible for most of the
material‐related carbon emissions from a consumption side. Technical or demand‐oriented strategies
should hence focus on these leverage points.
