Abstract
Having a daughter shapes parents’ attitudes and behaviors in gender-egalitarian ways, a finding documented in multiple industrialized democracies. We test whether this travels to a young
middle-income democracy where women’s rights are tenuous: South Africa. Contrary to prior
work we find no discernible effect on attitudes about women’s rights or partisan identification.
Using a unique dataset of over 7,500 respondents and an equivalence testing approach, we reject
the null hypothesis of any effects of 5 percentage points or greater at conventional levels of statistical significance. We speculate that our null findings relate to opportunity: daughter effects
are more likely when parents perceive economic, social, and political opportunities for women.
When women’s customary status and de facto opportunities are low, as in South Africa, having a
daughter may have no effect on parents’ political behavior. Our results demonstrate the virtues
of diversifying case selection in political behavior beyond economically wealthy democracies.

1. Introduction
Families shape political beliefs (Glass et al., 1986; Elder and Greene, 2012; Healy and Malhotra,
2013; Greenlee, 2014). The effect of one family feature, the sex of children, has been documented
among elites including U.S. representatives (Washington, 2008),1 U.S. judges (Glynn and Sen,
2015), and corporate executives (Dahl et al., 2012; Cronqvist and Yu, 2017), and in the general
public in Australia, Canada, the U.K., the U.S,. and China (Warner, 1991; Warner and Steel, 1999;
Oswald and Powdthavee, 2010; Prokos et al., 2010; Shafer and Malhotra, 2011; Sun and Lai, 2017;
Greenlee et al., 2018; Perales et al., 2018; Sharrow et al., 2018). Table 1 summarizes prior work on
political “daughter effects,” showing the empirical consensus that daughters move parents’ political
attitudes and behaviors in a more feminist direction, generally toward the political left.
We ask whether daughters change parents’ beliefs in a young middle-income democracy where
women’s rights remain tenuous: South Africa. On issues of gender rights, South Africa is de jure
progressive, but de facto not. This provides an opportunity to study the micro-foundations of public
opinions about gender, diagnosing how context may (fail to) influence attitudes. Our unique data,
which includes 7,500 respondents and, crucially, data on family structure for each respondent, allows
us to test for daughter effects on both attitudes and partisan ideological identification. Contrary
to prior research, we find null effects. Using the two-one sided test (TOST) approach (Robinson
and Froese, 2004; Lakens, 2017; Hartman and Hidalgo, 2018) for analyzing null effects, we reject
the null hypothesis of even very small effects at conventional levels of statistical significance.
These null effects are empirically important and theoretically informative. Contextual differences between South Africa and more established democracies provide an opportunity to learn
about when familial effects may, or may not, apply. We speculate that one important feature is
opportunity: Having a daughter may be more likely to affect parents when they perceive that economic, social, and political opportunities exist for women. Although women’s legal, economic, and
family rights are codified in South African law, women’s de facto status largely still comports with
traditional gender roles and social expectations around work and family. When women’s customary

status and de facto opportunities are low, having a daughter may not cause parents to reevaluate
their views. While we resist drawing definitive conclusions about cross-national differences, this
demonstrates the virtues of diversifying case selection in the study of political behavior beyond
economically wealthy and well-established democracies.

2. De Jure and De Facto Women’s Rights in South Africa
Like many emerging democracies, women’s rights in South Africa are well protected in law, but less
so in practice. Following the 1994 election, the African National Congress (ANC)-led government
made constitutional and voluntary governance changes to advance women’s equality. The postapartheid constitution included gender equality as a core principle. The first democratic parliament
passed several pieces of legislation related to women’s rights, including expanded access to abortion
and increased protection against domestic violence (Hassim, 2003, 101). By one measure, Htun
and Weldon’s (2012) index of legal protections to combat violence against women, South Africa
moved from a score of one (out of ten) in 1995 to eight in 2005. Across fourteen legal provisions on
women’s de jure economic rights measured by the World Bank, South Africa claimed none before
1993, but had achieved thirteen by the year 2000 (World Bank, 2017). The ANC has voluntarily
adopted a “zebra-list” quota in which men and women candidates are alternated on party lists,
making the country a world leader in women’s parliamentary representation.
Yet despite these gains many South African women experience low de facto status. Women are
much more likely to be employed in the informal sector and contribute more than twice the amount
of unpaid household work (World Economic Forum, 2016). These dynamics are borne out in social
expectations about gender roles. In the 2010 - 2014 World Values Survey, more respondents agreed
than disagreed that a woman earning more money than her husband “is almost certain to cause
problems in the home” and over half of respondents agreed that “when a mother works for pay, the
children suffer.” Finally, violence against women remains acute (Goldblatt and Meintjes, 1998).
An estimated 50.3 percent of female homicides in South Africa are due to intimate partner violence
(IPV) (Abrahams et al., 2009). In the most recent World Values Survey, 60 percent of respondents
reported that it is at least sometimes justifiable for a man to beat his wife. In short, South African

4

women’s de facto status falls far short of their de jure rights in the post-apartheid era.

3. Daughter Effects in a Changing Society
This discrepancy between de jure and de facto rights makes South Africa an important case to
test for the existence of daughter effects. If women’s de jure rights are important in shaping
parents’ beliefs, daughter effects should appear in South Africa. Research suggests parents change
their assessment of daughters based on their future potential. In India, exposure to female village
leaders changes parents’ career and educational aspirations for their daughters and lowers the rate
of sex-selective abortion, neglect, and infanticide (Beaman et al., 2012; Kalsi, 2017). Similarly,
Qian (2008) finds that higher tea prices, a crop traditionally picked by women, lowers the rate of
missing women in China due to parents’ changing assessment of women’s economic value. When
women are granted legal rights, parents may view their daughters differently or more equally due
to greater perceived opportunities, thus leading to the existence of daughter effects.
However, changes to women’s de jure rights may not affect how parents experience having
a daughter if these rights are slow to translate to de facto opportunities. Parents may not see
daughters as having opportunities in practice, or they may see these new opportunities as dangerous
if women working outside the home are subject to harassment or violence. If this view dominates,
we would not expect to observe daughter effects in the South African case: Parents may not change
their political beliefs when having a daughter if they view women’s opportunities as more related
to their de facto status than de jure rights.

4. Data and Research Design
To test whether daughter effects are present in South Africa, we use unique data from the South
African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS), a large repeated cross-section collected by the Human
Sciences Research Council (HSRC), South Africa’s statutory research agency for the social sciences
and humanities (HSRC, 2011). The data are yearly cross-sections of a nationally representative
sample of South Africans, surveying views on a range of political, social, and economic issues. We
use data collected from 2004 through 2012, for a total of 43,948 respondents. SASAS collects a
5

small amount of data on the entire household and their relationship to the respondent, from which
we can establish the household-dwelling family structure of each respondent.2 This feature sets
SASAS apart among political attitude surveys in sub-Saharan Africa; for example Afrobarometer,
the most widely used such survey collects no systematic information on family structure.
We leverage the natural experiment that occurs when a sperm initially fertilizes an egg, and in
the overwhelming proportion of cases, the resulting fetus is assigned either two X chromosomes or
an X and a Y. As our main design, we focus on the effect of the sex of the first child which we see
as the strongest possible design in this setting (see Lee and Conley, 2015; Oswald and Powdthavee,
2010). This avoids possible bias introduced by families who employ “differential stopping rules,”
where decisions about whether to have another child are affected by the sex of the first child.
Because families that continue to have children until they have a child of the desired sex are likely
different from families that do not employ differential stopping rules, we focus only on the sex of
the first child. Due to randomness in sex assignment, those whose first child is male should be good
counterfactuals for those whose first child is female.
Although the sex of the first child is as-if random at the point of conception and sex-selective
abortion in South Africa is rare (Garenne, 2002), concerns remain. First, the data collection
procedure means that we do not know if there are children who have already left the home. To
address this, we subset our sample to respondents aged 45 and younger, thus focusing on those who
are less likely to have adult children.3
Second, it is possible that children may be placed into a different household post-birth, or that
the children living in the household were adopted, and not biologically conceived by the parents
who raise them. If this occurred in such a way that boys and girls were not adopted by comparable
families, it would introduce the possibility of systematic error where certain types of parents are
more likely to adopt children of a particular sex. To evaluate the risk of this potential confounding
in the SI we compare “treated” and “untreated” respondents across pre-treatment covariates –
2 Household

is defined in the survey as “all persons who eat from the same cooking pot and who
were resident 15 out of the past 30 days.”
3 Results presented in the SI show that, aside from improving precision due to increased power,
including all ages in the sample does not materially change the results. The same applies, though
precision decreases as power decreases, when sub-setting to those under the age of 35.
6

race, sex, and age of the respondent, all of which are typically important covariates in South Africa
(Ferree, 2011). Imbalance is relatively small in magnitude, but to be conservative we estimate all
effects both with and without controlling for these same covariates.

5. Results
We examine the effect of sex of first child on five outcomes: attitudes towards preferential hiring of
women; views on abortion in two cases (a birth defect in the fetus and a low-income mother who
can’t afford to raise a child); a gender equality battery (only included in the 2008 survey),4 and
partisan support of the dominant political party, the center-left ANC. Figure 1 visualizes these five
outcomes as proportions supporting a particular policy, split by the sex of the first child. None of
the differences are large, and for most policies, respondents whose first child is a son are slightly
more progressive. We statistically test for treatment effects by assuming a null hypothesis of “no
effect” and an alternative hypothesis of a “non-zero effect,” using ordinary least squares (OLS),
with and without controlling for covariates:

Yi = αt + Di β + Xi| γ + i
Where αt represents a survey fixed-effect for a survey in time t, Di is a dummy variable indicating
that the first child was a girl (Di = 1) or a boy (Di = 0), and β is the estimate of the causal effect
of first-child gender on Yi , a variety of outcomes. Xi| γ represents a set of optional linear controls
for a variety of pre-treatment covariates, and j is an individual-level error.
Table 2 confirms what visual inspection of Figure 1 suggests: the effect of having a daughter
is largely indistinguishable from zero, aside from a negative and statistically significant result on
abortion rights (about three percentage points less supportive, and thus counter to expectations).
4 This

battery asked respondents to report the degree to which they agreed with the following
statements: “A working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her
children as a mother who does not work,” “A child younger than 5 years is likely to suffer if his or
her mother works,” “All in all, family life suffers when the woman has a full-time job,” “A job is
alright, but what most women really want is a home and children,” “Being a housewife is just as
fulfilling as working for pay,” and “A man’s job is to earn money, a woman’s job is to look after
the home and family.”

While such results are often interpreted as a null effect, a well established literature in statistics
notes that to properly draw conclusions about a null effect, one should invert the hypotheses being
tested. Conventional statistical testing allows us only to reject, or fail to reject, the null hypothesis
of a zero effect. To test for a zero effect, we should instead test the null hypothesis of a “non-zero
effect” against the alternative hypothesis of “no effect,” referred to as equivalence testing. We
employ a two-one sided test (TOST) approach (Robinson and Froese, 2004; Lakens, 2017; Hartman
and Hidalgo, 2018), and calculate a formal p-value by specifying a theoretical effect size λ, any
smaller than which we would consider a small or approximately zero treatment effect. We then test
the null hypothesis that the effect is greater than or equal to λ, or less than or equal to −λ.
For each outcome, we estimate the effect of having a daughter within the TOST framework in
two ways: first, by simply comparing the proportion of respondents supporting the outcome whose
first child is a daughter, and those whose first child is a son, and second by matching respondents
on age, sex, race, and survey year, and repeat the process. The results are presented in Figure 2,
with λ = ±5 percentage point treatment effect for ease of interpretation. This means that an effect
greater than 5 percentage points is considered a non-zero effect, which is roughly the lower bound of
statistically significant results reported in prior studies. This choice of λ is somewhat arbitrary, so
for completeness in the SI we show how the p-values for each test vary as a function of λ. Generally,
it appears that our conclusions hold down to λ ≈ 2.5 percentage points.
Figure 2 is interpreted by assessing the (lack of) overlap between the 95% confidence intervals
and the vertical dotted lines, and the corresponding TOST p-values. Out of the 10 tests we conduct,
in only two – scoring above the median on a gender equality scale – were we unable to reject the
null of a statistically significant non-zero effect for our definition of a small effect. Importantly, in
both of these cases we have much less data because the question was only asked in one year, and
the TOST confidence interval itself also includes 0, suggesting that very little can be concluded
either way.
In the SI we estimate the results separately by sex of respondent. For the unmatched data, we
find no nonzero effects for any outcome, for either sex. Among women in the matched dataset,
we likewise find no nonzero effects. For men in the matched dataset, for three of the outcomes,

Effect of having a daughter

we find no meaningful effect, but having a daughter is associated with an increase in support for
preferential hiring, and a decrease in support for abortion in the case of a birth defect. While these
latter two estimates are distinguishable from 0, they are not distinguishable from an effect of 5
percentage points. We find it most plausible that these effects are the result of statistical noise
given the number of tests being conducted, particularly since they are not in a consistent direction.
Thus, in total, we interpret the body of evidence to suggest that the sex of the first child has
either no discernible effects or very marginal and theoretically inconsistent effects on the beliefs
and preferences of South African parents. The SI also contains several additional specifications,
including subsetting the sample to parents with only one child. The results we present below are
not substantively changed across specifications.

6. Discussion and Conclusion
It seems clear that personal experiences and circumstances shape political socialization, attitudes,
and behavior (Huckfeldt et al., 1993; Kasara, 2013; Sands, 2017). Evidence from industrialized
democracies suggests that one such experience is having a daughter, which substantively shifts

11

parents’ attitudes and behaviors. Yet this finding does not travel to South Africa, a young middleincome democracy where women’s rights are far more tenuous. Having a daughter as opposed to a
son does not appear to change parents’ attitudes towards gender equality or partisanship. We find
no consistent effects for either mothers or fathers across a range of specifications and outcomes.
Our evidence further suggests these results are not simply due to noise or low statistical power, but
are “true nulls.”
Other authors have argued that parents may see the formal codification of women’s rights as
a signal that their daughter will have more opportunities than in the past, providing incentives to
treat their sons and daughters equally. We speculate that in the South African case this process
may not unfold because women’s de jure status remains stubbornly low. Across a number of
measures, including access to education, the formal labor force, and freedom from violence, South
African women still fare significantly worse than men. Parents, then, may not see the increase in
women’s de facto legal rights and protections as meaning much in terms of opportunities for their
daughters, and thus have little reason to update their behaviors or attitudes. We speculate that a
potential pre-condition for daughter effects exists: men and women may need to have relative de
jure equality before having a daughter changes parents’ attitudes. Notably, the only other study
that reports similar nulls studies China, where women’s status is also low (Sun and Lai, 2017).
Research examining how gender attitudes change over time suggests that citizens must be
exposed to women in non-traditional roles for many years or even decades before they begin to
update their beliefs about gender equality (Beaman et al., 2012; Clayton, 2018). Changes in
women’s legal status appears to not cause parents of daughters to change their beliefs in the years
immediately following reforms. It may take some time before advancements in women’s legal rights
are reflected in public opinion toward gender equality, and thus before family experiences will act
as a conduit for these new beliefs.
