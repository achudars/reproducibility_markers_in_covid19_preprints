The Theory of the Political Spectrum
By Allen Gindler
Abstract

The article introduces a new approach to the problem of political spectrum
polarization. Political science has introduced a multitude of spectrograms based on
different factors, dimensions, axes, and cardinal points. Most often the graphics do not
complement each other, and it seems that each of them describes a completely different
reality. There was an urgent need to conduct an objective analysis of political
philosophies and find the factors that influence the political spectrum polarization. For
these purposes, the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was used, as it allows to
introduce a fraction of objectivity due to the use of a formalized mathematical
apparatus of the theory of sets. Thirteen main political doctrines were analyzed and
obtained that spectrum polarization depends on three conditions: attitude to private
property, individual freedom, and wealth redistribution. As the factors that influence
the political spectrum polarization were firmly determined, it became possible to build
a spectrogram unambiguously.

Introduction

In the course of evolution, people have formulated many philosophical ideas
concerning the socio-economic structure of society. Some of these ideas became a
reality, while others remained purely imaginary constructs. All real and abstract socioeconomic ideas constitute the political spectrum. Humans have habitually tried to
classify and visualize a political variety, in order to make sense of its structure and find
1

a proper place for their worldview. Thus, the political spectrum is most often understood as a
graphic representation of various politico-philosophical positions on diverse issues that are
relevant to society in a certain period of time.

This definition implies that the political spectrum is not only historic but
multidimensional. The specific timeframe is extremely important as some issues that
are relevant now were not considered in the past. Different eras produce different social
issues, and the weight of these issues changes accordingly. For example, the legalization
of marijuana or same-sex marriage was not a problem that worried society a century
ago. Some questions have passed the test of time; they were prominent in the past and
they are relevant now. Thus, such eternal questions include concerns of individual
freedom, attitude to property, justice, civil rights, to name a few.

Humankind has developed a practice of solving issues comprehensively by
creating political philosophies or ideologies that suggest solutions to the main issues in
a packaged form. People can choose among bundled solutions by clinging to this or that
ideology. These ideologies suggest different ways of solving problems facing society.
The more backward a society, the fewer questions are tackled through political
doctrine. There is also an interconnection between issues within a political ideology: the
solution to some problems depends on the solution to others. Every ideology must have
its own answer to the questions. Political doctrine cannot be silent on actual societal
problems; otherwise, it will be ignored by people.

Historians have traced the most common and long-standing “left-right” political
spectra to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789–
2

1799). As the story goes, the aristocracy sat on the privileged seats at the right; their
agenda was to preserve an existing state of affairs. Commoners occupied the left wing;
they were for laissez-faire commerce and civil liberties (Knapp & Wright, 2001). Since
then, agents of the status quo have been associated with the right-wing; on the other
hand, representatives of change have been linked to the left-wing. Therefore, in people’s
perceptions, leftist ideologies are actively seeking modifications to the existing socioeconomic formation. Accordingly, the right-wingers are proponents and keepers of the
existing order.

The Political Spectrum Dynamics

At the time of the French Revolution, when the original “left-right” political
spectrum was born, society had a straightforward structure composed of the
aristocracy, the clergy, and commoners. A political struggle was staged between
nobilities on the one side and everybody else on the another. At that time, the political
spectrum exhibited a pronounced dichotomy.

It was the epoch of feudalism’s swan song in which Western European countries
battled with outdated feudalism. Ultimately, feudal aristocracy lost to capitalism.
Capitalism was a left-wing agent of change, and feudalism was a right-wing
representative of the preservation of the status quo. Indeed, nobility and clergy
identified commoners as radical leftists. They restricted nobilities from exclusive power,
privileges, and wealth.

3

After the victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolutions in the overwhelming
majority of European countries, from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of
the 20th century, the political situation changed. During capitalism’s advance, the
political spectrum developed in two distinct ways based on the following events. The
first event was a switch of the political spectrum polarization. Using the terminology of the
one-dimensional political spectrum introduced by the French, the former left became
right and vice versa. Absolutism was defeated and joined the ranks of outdated
ideologies. The free market ideology began to take the right stance because its
supporters were committed to maintaining the new status quo. It should be noted that
the destruction of the capitalist democratic state by the Bolsheviks or fascists also led to
a switch in the polarization of the political spectrum. However, under totalitarian
regimes, this change was camouflaged by the collapse of the legal political activity,
which was expressed as a ban on dissent. Based on the foregoing, it is tempting to
originate a common socio-political law that states:

The socio-economic changes in society result in a switch in the polarization of the political
spectrum.

The most significant achievements of the democratic revolution were guaranteed
civil rights, political freedom, and economic freedom. These resulted in a quantum leap
in all aspects of human activities. Those involved with science, technology, architecture,
literature, and art reached unprecedented achievements. Society became more
developed, knowledgeable, and heterogeneous, producing a vast amount of different
politico-philosophical ideas.

4

Therefore, this second event was a broadening of the political spectrum. This
spectrum inflation occurred only during the development of capitalism and democratic
institutions. No other political orders have shown anything similar in the entire history
of mankind. When more radical changes are proposed, the political spectrum is shifted
more to the left, and ideological struggles ensue. The political spectrum widens, while
the right exhibits almost no movement, as status-quo, in principle, is static. The right
remained fixed in place until it abandoned its hold by losing in the political struggle.
The capitalist democratic system was defeated by various currents of socialism in some
countries during the 20th century. The vast majority of the former communist block of
Eastern Europe embraced capitalism once again several decades later after their defeat
in the Cold War.

Regardless of an imaginary or real switch in the polarization of the political
spectrum, the modern political spectrum under question is a progeny of capitalism. No other
political system has made possible coexistence of a great variety of different sociopolitical philosophies, currents, and movements. Ironically, the majority of them has
been trying to dissolve capitalism to varying degrees. The only right-wing ideologies
are trying to conserve the gains of the democratic-bourgeoisie revolution: free market,
civil rights, and supremacy of law.

Finding Objectivity

A political spectrum is a system of qualitative comparisons of different political
philosophies. Humans tried to grasp the main characteristics of political ideologies and
sort them by importance, relevance, and usefulness for an individual and society as a
5

whole. The political spectrum is not a natural phenomenon taking place in the physical
world but rather a product of human cognitive abilities. It is a subjective perception and
valuation of the variety of political thoughts that are generated within society.

People tend to associate themselves with a particular ideology that suits their
worldview and reject ones that do not fit their mentality. At present, the political
spectrum has become broader and more heterogeneous since freedom has spawned
many different political ideas. People became politically savvy and wise in all
vicissitudes of politics. Therefore, conditions that are responsible for the classification
and ranking of political doctrines along a political spectrum became rather intricate.
Moreover, they have been distorted by political necessities, propaganda and
counterpropaganda, human emotions, and revisionism of historical events.

Whatever arguments one side of the political spectrum brings, the other side
refutes with ease. Then the former rebuffs the latter, and this goes on forever. Thus, it is
necessary to present a method that carries neutrality and objectivity in the political
discourse. It is essential to find traits that will unambiguously sort out ideologies along
a political spectrum. What does it mean to belong to the left movement? What
conditions lead to a particular right ideology? What are the mechanisms and factors
responsible for the classifications and rankings of political ideas?

Take Italian Fascism, for example. Neither the left nor the right wants to claim
ownership of fascism. There is no consensus among political scientists, sociologists, and
economists on the placement of fascism within a political spectrum. Leftists have been
so vigorously fighting off fascism that they thrust it to the ultra-right position, to the
6

right of the classical liberalism. The right has considered fascism as phenomena of the
Left, foremost from the first principle that there is nothing to the right of liberal
capitalism in a capitalistic society. The founder of Fascism proclaimed that Fascism
superseded both capitalism and Marxian socialism and positioned it neither on the left
side nor on the right side. It was supposed to be an ideology that transcends the leftright paradigm.

The phenomenon of fascism was difficult to grasp as it contained with itself
different elements from both Left and the Right doctrines. Moreover, the analysis of the
problem with fascism has been subjected to ideological bias and emotional
predisposition. Placing fascism on a specific position in the political spectrum has
depended on political correctness and propaganda, not on scientific and objective
efforts. Many visualizations of the political spectrum could not put fascism in its
historical and ideological place, which arguably invalidates them.

Moreover, scholars have not found agreement on which principal factors
influence the placement of a particular ideology along the political spectrum, whether
the political spectrum is one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Scientists have ignored
the phenomenon of the switching polarization of the spectrum and the importance of a
specific frame of reference when building it.

The 20th-century one-dimensional spectrum has communism on the left and
fascism and Nazism on the right along with ideologies that support a free market
economy. Left-wing academia still adheres to this graphic representation of the political
spectrum. However, the positioning of communism and fascism with Nazism on
7

diametrically opposites poles neglects the existence of totalitarianism as a critical
commonality between all three regimes. In order to bring fascism and communism
closer, the linear spectrum was curved to form a circle. In the circular spectrum,
communism and fascism occupied adjacent positions, correspondingly to the left and
the right of the vertical diameter. “Democracy” was positioned on the other side of the
circle.

In 1967, Lawrence McGann published an article entitled “The Political
Spectrum,” where he criticized the “circular theory” (McGann, 1967). He pointed out
that there is no room in the model for another uncomfortable player in building a
spectrum - anarchism - and proposed a modified linear model instead. His model
classified political ideology according to the degree of state control and has two
cardinal points: anarchy with 0% government regulation and totalitarianism with 100%
state control. “Democracy” falls somewhere in between.

In 1968, Bryson and McDill offered a bi-dimensional model of the political
spectrum (Bryson, 1968). The position on the vertical axis represents the degree of
governmental control (statism vs. anarchy), and the location on the horizontal axis
represents the degree of egalitarianism favored (left vs. right). In the same magazine
issue, Bowman N. Hall, II suggested the L.F.E. Theory of Political Spectrum, where
L.F.E. stands for the “lopsided figure eight theory” (Bowman, 1968). The author
combined the bi-directional spectrum with some circular features. On the X-axis, there
is “respect for private property,” while the Y-axis denotes “political regulation.” The
author claimed that his approach combines the best of both circular and linear theories.
However, even a glance at the chart would reveal some inconsistencies in the placement
8

of some political doctrines. For example, “collectivist anarchists” is placed on a point
with a fairly high degree of “respect of private property,” which is not correct.

David Nolan, the founding member of the US Libertarian party, presented his
chart in 1971, which depicted different political ideologies along two axes: “Economic
Freedom” and “Personal Freedom.” His approach seems to be the most promising;
however, the question of properly placing Fascism and anarchism on the graph remains
open for discussion. People still want to have a definite answer: what ideology belongs
to the left and what ideology belongs to the right.

Scholars have suggested varieties of political spectrum graphs, employing
different geometries, dimensions, axes, and cardinal points. However, the controversy
surrounding the political spectrum does not subside. In order to change the current
state of affairs, it is imperative to find an objective way to assign a particular ism to the
left or to the right. Therefore, the goal is to find unbiased aspects of political
philosophies that can unambiguously determine placement in the political spectrum.
Such tasks imply a comprehensive examination of political doctrines (in-case study) and
comparison between them (in-between case).

The best method of conducting corresponding research in social science is called
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). The research in question differs from the
traditional social science investigation in two crucial aspects. First of all, the subject of
the study is not a country or a social group, but rather particular characteristics of
political ideologies. Secondly, the observable phenomenon is a somewhat artificial
mental construct rather than observable social or political fact.
9

The last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century were rich in
generating various political ideologies, changing the social order. Consequently, it is
rational to investigate real and abstract political ideas that flourished at that time.
Political philosophies that were selected for examination are the following: Marxism,
Trotskyism, Social-Democracy, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, Anarcho-Syndicalism,
Anarcho-Communism, Revolutionary-Syndicalism, Fascism, National-Socialism,
Conservative Liberalism, Progressivism, and Classical Liberalism.

The first question that needs to be answered is which aspects of political
ideology make it belong to the left in post-industrial societies. Answering this question
in conjunction with analyzing factors that place a political doctrine to the right would
reveal the exact geometry, dimensions, and axes of the political spectrum. The
undeniable advantage of QCA is the formalization of the verbal provisions of political
doctrines and their translation into the mathematical language of set theory.

Qualitative Comparative Analysis of Political Ideologies

Charles Ragin developed qualitative comparative analysis in the late 1990s. Since
then, the method has rapidly advanced and become widely used in social studies. The
main idea of the method is that relations between social phenomena are perceived of as
set relations. As such, in order to uncover interconnections between cases and
outcomes, QCA employs the mathematical apparatus of set theory, which is based on
Boolean algebra.

10

The domains of the study are political philosophies that constitute a political
spectrum. They are verbal by nature and can be stated in terms of sets and set relations.
For instance, “conservatism is a right-wing ideology” is equivalent to the phrase
“conservatism is a subset of right-wing “ideologies”; in turn, “right-wing ideologies are
a subset of the whole political spectrum.” Moreover, every unique aspect of political
ideologies is a member of its corresponding conceptual set. Thus, “revolution” and
“evolution” are both elements of the set “methods of change.”

The goal of set-theoretic methods is to establish explicit connections between sets
of interest. QCA assists in identifying commonalities across an array of political
ideologies that prompt meaningful empirical connections. This means that QCA could
discover causal relationships between attributes of political ideologies and their role in
the placement of a particular theory on the political spectrum.

In QCA terms, aspects of political philosophies that are thought to be causes of a
phenomenon are called "conditions," while the phenomenon itself is called an
"outcome." An outcome in this study is an assignment of the political ideology to the
left or the right on the political spectrum. In other words, the outcome is political
spectrum polarization. Philosophical aspects can be causally linked to an outcome as
necessary or sufficient conditions, either by themselves or in combination with one
another. Thus, set relations are interpreted in terms of sufficiency, necessity, and forms
of causalities.

For this study, the fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA) was chosen as the most adequate.
Fuzzy sets are both qualitative and quantitative. They allow researchers to establish
11

difference-in-kind between cases (qualitative difference) and determine difference-indegree (quantitative difference) between qualitatively identical cases (Schneider &
Wagemann 2012). Every political philosophy is considered to be an individual case
under the study.

The data on which QCA operates are the membership scores of cases in sets,
which represent political science concepts. Fuzzy sets explicitly require that the
definition of set membership values be based on three qualitative anchors: full set
membership (1), full non-membership (0), and indifference (0.5). The anchor of
indifference is a point of maximum ambiguity; therefore, assigning a 0.5 membership
score is not recommended.

For example, “proletariat” is an element of the set “agents of change.” A
membership score of Marxism-Leninism in the set “agents of change” is 1, as this theory
designates a proletariat as the only force of a socialist revolution. In the case of Maoism,
however, the “proletariat” was not a major social influencer. A membership score of
Maoism in the set “agents of change” would be a 0, as it relies on the peasantry as an
agent of change. In this example, “proletariat” and “peasantry” are supposed to
illustrate two boundary membership values of the fuzzy set “agents of change.”

In general, the score of membership in fuzzy sets varies from 0 to 1 and could be
any value except the value of maximum ambiguity. We employed the four-value
scheme (Tab. 1), which is especially useful in situations where researchers have a
substantial amount of information about cases, but the evidence is not systematic or
strictly comparable from case to case (Ragin, 2008).
12

One of the first tasks in qualitative research is to find aspects (conditions) that
describe a political theory the best and might influence an outcome. Any mature
political theory outlines its positions on designated goals, primary enemies, agents of
change, methods of change, scope and pace of implementation, economic and social
policies, relations between classes, dealings between state and individuals, questions on
nationalism and race, attitudes toward immigration, taxation and tariffs, wages and
wealth redistribution, etc.

While seeking the focal, descriptive attributes of political ideologies, careful
attention was paid to the questions that caused heated quarrels among the competing
philosophical doctrines. Those questions became common points of bifurcation between
theories. An issue of the "role of a state" alienated anarchists and Marxists, while a
question of "scope of change" estranged Trotskyists and Stalinists. After the thorough
and repeated examination, the following five principal conditions were chosen for
QCA:
-

Attitude toward private property

13

-

Type of economy

-

Wealth redistribution

-

Individual freedom

-

Nationalism/racism

These aspects of political studies can be considered most relevant in the context of the
political struggle in the period between the second half of the nineteenth and the second
half of the twentieth centuries.

“Attitude toward private property” determines if the means of production are
collectivized or remain in private hands. The extreme left ideologies are unconditionally
against private property and call for the socialization of all means of production.
Reformists set the same goals but in a more gradual way. In any case, the left tried to
control private enterprises in one way or another. On the contrary, the right ideologies
cherished private property. Thus, bearing in mind the opposite approach to private
property, this condition makes its way into the QCA through the abbreviation “CP” –
collectivization of property.

“Type of economy” means whether a political doctrine promotes a market
economy or a planned one. The left had developed a personal dislike for the market
economy. Many leftist political ideologies advocated for a planned economy instead.
The right political ideologies, of course, fully supported a market economy in a different
degree of regulation. This condition is essential and gains inclusion in the final analysis.
It is abbreviated as “PE” – planned economy.

14

“Wealth redistribution” describes a transfer of wealth from one individual or
strata to others by means of expropriation, taxation, welfare, etc., and fueled a plethora
of social programs. Political doctrines suggest a different scope of social programs
ranging from minimal to very generous. The Left usually advocated for the expansion
of wealth redistribution programs, whereas the Right tries keeping them to a minimum.
This dichotomy prompts the inclusion of another condition into the model. It is named
“WR” – wealth redistribution.

The attitudes dealing with “individual freedom” range from its complete
negating (collectivization of consciousness) to minimal intrusion into private life.
Currents on the Left have different approaches to this issue. Thus, anarchists promoted
a stateless community and complete individual freedom: some viewed a state as a
temporary entity; others as the main achievement of the society. The Right has
traditionally cherished individual freedom, pluralism of opinions, and a nonintrusive
state. An issue of personal freedom is included in the qualitative analysis as a
potentially significant condition. The condition is abbreviated as “CC” – collectivization
of consciousness.

“Nationalism and racism” are self-explanatory attributes, but are extremely
sensitive, distorted, and therefore politicized. It is a common perception that the Left
was a proponent of internationalism and that nationalism is the trademark of the Right.
A careful examination of the different political ideologies and actions of different
regimes reveals that nationalism/racism are equally applicable to the doctrines situated
at both ends of the political spectrum. Nationalism/Racism could potentially influence
an outcome, and therefore, this condition will be put under analysis by the name “NR.”
15

The next step in fsQCA is defining qualitative anchors that denote a full
membership (1) and full non-membership (0) for every condition (the aspect of the
doctrine) and outcome (the place on the spectrum). The qualitative benchmarks that
will be used in fuzzy set calibration are presented in Tab. 2.

There are two cases of political ideologies, which are characterized by fullmembership and full-non-membership in both corresponding conditions and outcomes:
Marxism-Leninism and Classical Liberalism.

Marxism-Leninism stood for the complete abolishment of private property
(CP=1), utilized planned economy (PE=1), built welfare (WR=1), totalitarian state
(CC=1), and exerted extreme atrocities on different ethnic groups (NR=1)1. On the
contrary, Classical Liberalism advocated for the prevalence of private property (CP=0),
market economy (PE=0), minimum of wealth redistribution (WR=0), full individual
freedom (CC=0), and international trade (NR=0).

Undoubtedly, Marxism-Leninism is the left political doctrine (Left=1), as it
actively seeks the destruction of the democratic state and complete collectivization of
the means of production. There is no uncertainty that classical liberalism is a genuine
right-wing ideology (Left=0) that guarantees property rights and individual freedom.
These ideologies are complete opposites of each other by the score of memberships in
their corresponding condition configurations and outcomes.

Faithful Leninists carried out a policy of coerced Russification: they closed national schools, newspapers,

magazines, and houses of worship. The Soviet regime repressed Don Cossacks; deported Poles,
Ukrainians, Moldovans, and people from the Baltic states; resettled Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars,
Chechens, and Ingush to other territories; starved four million Ukrainians to death during Holodomor;
and were outright anti-Semitic. Only Stalin’s death saved Soviet Jewry from a genocide that could match
the Nazi one (Gindler, 2019).

The rest of the political philosophies whose ideas are grounded in the
interpretation of five main factors lie in between these two extremes. Their scores of
memberships in corresponding sets have to be determined by a calibration procedure.

There are two methods of calibration suggested in fsQCA: direct and indirect.
Both methods imply calibration of fuzzy sets using external criteria. In the direct
method, values of external standards (economic indexes, for example) are assigned to
the corresponding three qualitative anchors (full membership, full non-membership,
and the crossover point). Then, these benchmarks are used to transform the original
interval-scale values to fuzzy membership scores. In the indirect method, the researcher
performs an initial sorting of cases into different levels of membership, assigning
different levels of preliminary membership scores, and then refining these membership
scores using the interval-scale data.

The techniques presented assume that the interval-scale external indicators exist
for every condition and outcome. Unfortunately, a study of political spectrums does not
possess such a luxury. There are several reasons for that. The subjects under study are
political theories that are abstract ideas, not real social facts. If an idea has never been

18

materialized, the external standards cannot be appropriately applied to them. For those
political ideas that have been institutionalized, some conditions still could not be
correlated with existing external indicators. Moreover, for such conditions that are in
good explanatory connection with external standards, the data is not going back
historically as much as needed, i.e., the last half of the 19th century, in order to properly
calibrate all the cases. External data could calibrate some of the conditions; nonetheless,
it is not advisable to utilize different methods to score membership assessment across
various cases and conditions.

Does it mean that the fuzzy set analysis of political ideologies is inappropriate?
The answer is definitely negative. It is possible to refine the initial membership scores,
as in the indirect method, by some other external procedure. For this purpose, the
Delphi method was employed. The Delphi method is a process that involves interaction
and cooperation between the researcher and a group of experts proficient in the subject
under the study. Initially, this method was used in the forecasting procedures, and as in
any forecast endeavor, it brings mixed results. In the study of political spectrums, such
prognosis is not an aim. On the contrary, experts are looking back at historical processes
and facts that were not systematized, enumerated, and ranked. These circumstances
simplify experts’ work as they need to systematize existing knowledge. Thorough
interactions and collaborations between the researcher and experts resulted in refined
fuzzy sets as presented in Tab. 4.

The first task we are trying to solve is to find factors that deterministically
classify a political doctrine as the left one. Therefore, only parameters that have
universal consensus were chosen for the outcome (Left). Outcomes for fascism and

20

national socialism were intentionally marked “?” as there is no consensus among
scholars in the placement of these regimes in the political spectrum. It means that
neither fascism nor Nazism would be taken into account in the initial iterations of
mathematical calculations.

Further assay is to build a truth table. A truth table is the main instrument in
analyzing casual complexity. It is evident that the same outcome, for example,
“ideologies leaning to the left,” can be achieved via several different combinations of
casual conditions. In QCA, such combinations are customarily called “recipes” or
configurations. A truth table consists of all logical configurations and corresponding
outcomes. The main goal of a truth table analysis is to identify explicit casual
connections between “recipes” and outcomes (Ragin, 2008).

A truth table differs from the data matrix presented in Tab. 4, where every row
denotes a different case. In a truth table, each row instead represents one of the logically
possible options AND combinations between the conditions. A truth table that is
derived from a fuzzy set establishes a qualitative difference between cases above the
anchor of maximum ambiguity — 0.5 (more in than out) versus cases below that point
(more out than in). As every single condition may be either present or absent, there are
2k total rows in the truth table, where k is the number of conditions. Since the model
consists of 5 conditions, there are 32 rows in the table. Among 32 cases, only 13 have
been “observed.”1 As for the rest, neither empirical nor abstract evidence is available.
They are, in essence, thought experiments, called counterfactual cases.

Including Cases for Fascism and National-Socialism

Each set constitutes one dimension of the vector space. The five fuzzy-set
conditions produce a five-dimensional space. Each corner of the space represents one
specific combination of the two extreme values that are possible in fuzzy sets—full
membership-1 and full non-membership-0. For each condition, the 1s and 0s indicate
the different corners of the vector space defined by the fuzzy set’s causal conditions.
Therefore, each corner represents an ideal combination, where full membership and
non-membership are clearly defined. In fuzzy-set QCA, cases might have partial
membership in all rows, but they definitely have a membership higher than 0.5 in only
one row. Consequently, cases are allocated to that particular ideal row to which they fit
best.

We use fsQCA software developed by Ragin’s team to construct a Truth Table
from the fuzzy set in Tab. 4 (Ragin, 2014).

Number—the number of cases with membership greater than 0.5 in that corner
of the vector space. Row Consistency - the degree to which membership in that corner
of the vector space is a consistent subset of membership in the outcome.

Analyzing the Truth Table

Reported consistency assists in determining if a specific truth table row is
sufficient for the outcome. In other words, it determines whether the conjunction of five
specified conditions is a subset of the outcome set. Causal combinations with
consistency scores above the cutoff value (recommended 0.85) are assigned to be
subsets of the outcome and are coded 1. If the conjunction of conditions is below the
cutoff value, it is not a subset of the outcome, and it is coded 0 (Tab. 2). Hence, the four
upper rows in the truth table have 1 in the “Left” column. It can be understood that the
rows that have 1 in the outcome are sufficient conditions for the outcome to occur. In
other words, there are four combinations of causal conditions that are sufficient to bend
a political ideology to the left.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are interested in singling
out the main factors that influence the polarization of the political spectrum. Thus, we
would like to get a more laconic and parsimonious answer. For this, fsQCA is employed
by the Quine-McCluskey algorithm (Quine 1955, McCluskey 1956) to minimize the
sufficiency statements presented in the Truth Table logically. This algorithm uses the
simplification rules of Boolean expressions presented in the Truth Table. If two
expressions differ in only one condition but produce the same outcome, then the casual
condition that distinguishes the two expressions can be considered irrelevant and can
24

be removed. The end products of the consecutive pairwise logical minimization process
are “prime implicants.” “Prime implicants” are combined through logical OR and
under certain circumstances could be logically redundant, and some of them can be
dropped from the solution term in order to obtain the most parsimonious formula. This
algorithm designates a prime implicant as logically redundant if all of the primitive
expressions are covered without it being included in the solution formula (Schneider &
Wagemann, 2012).

The subjects of our study are political philosophies. Some of them were
materialized but died out, and some continue to prosper. Some political ideas have
never been institutionalized and continue to live in the realm of the ideal. Some of the
philosophical thoughts under the study are illogical utopian descriptions of societies
living in paradise. We consider them counterfactual, imaginary political philosophies
that are not worse than existing and documented ideas. Political philosophies are not
impossible remainders and could be applied in thought experiments. All political ideas
have a right to exist; as such, the counterfactual cases should be included in QCA and
take part in the minimization process. For example, take a look at configurations in Tab.

The first case describes a political doctrine that neglects a private property and
market economy, advocates for extreme nationalism/racism, and desires an
implementation of an unobtrusive state. The other political philosophy respects private
property, and the market economy preaches bigotry and advocates for individual
freedom. (By the way, this is what right-wing nationalism should look like.) These
ideologies are imaginary, but there are no fundamental reasons that such ideas could
not be thought of in the past or could not be formulated or even attempted to be
materialized in the future. They are as real as Marxism or Trotskyism in this sense.

Therefore, all types of minimization should be applied in the framework of this
research, which would result in the most laconic interpretation of causality between
political factors and outcomes. The standard analysis produced the following result:

Let us make sense of the results that we obtained. First of all, QCA selects three
causal conditions that influence the outcome. They are CP – collectivization of property,
WR – wealth redistribution, and CC – collectivization of consciousness. Each selected
condition has a very high coefficient of consistency and coverage. Therefore, they
cannot be dismissed as insignificant. The overall solution is characterized by an almost
perfect score for coverage as well as consistency. Thus, QCA has produced a robust
solution that passes the statistical significance test.

In terms of set theory, the solution is written as follows:

CP + WR + CC à Left

(1)

where “+” is OR operand, “à” is subset operand.

Since all three factors (CC, WR, CC) are subsets of the outcome set (left), they are
sufficient conditions for the outcome to occur. In other words, socialization of the
means of production, wealth redistribution, and the subjugation of the individual to the
collective are the cornerstone provisions of the left's ideology. And furthermore, the
conditions are connected by the OR operand, which means that if any of the three
conditions happen to be TRUE, the whole expression becomes TRUE as well. That is, if
a political ideology suggests the collectivization of property (CP is TRUE) but opposes
wealth redistribution (WR is FALSE) such a doctrine still belongs to the Left.

The result outlines three distinct paths to leftism: a dislike of private property,
wealth redistribution, and collectivization of consciousness. Those paths can be

27

employed individually or complement each other. For example, communism utilizes all
three paths; evolutionary Socialism predominantly employs a wealth redistribution
mechanism, and fascism engages in the collectivization of consciousness and
introduction of generous social programs. Recall that we specifically omitted fascism
and national socialism from the model. However, obtained results show the paths to
socialism that both odious regimes had employed. One can argue that these regimes did
not de jure forbid private property, but one cannot dispute the fact that both fascists
and Nazis implemented a totalitarian state and implemented very generous social
programs aimed at the comprehensive support of working people.

Therefore, fascism and Nazism genuinely belong to the socialist current, having
at least two conditions out of three as TRUE. For their case, the formula takes the
following form:

[CP is FALSE] OR [WR is TRUE] OR [CC is TRUE] à [LEFT is TRUE]

(2)

It is also worth mentioning that even though private property was nominally
allowed, it was controlled by the omnipotent and omnipresent state. To end ambiguity
surrounding fascism and Nazism, it is necessary to firmly state the following: Italian
Fascism and National Socialism belong to the Left as they are incarnations of the nonMarxian socialism that utilized collectivization of consciousness and compulsory wealth
redistribution rather than the socialization of private property as the primary path
toward socialism (Gindler, 2019). And yet, state control over the economy ultimately led
to the gradual socialization of private property, which made the state de jure owner.

28

Also note that the condition NR — “nationalism/racism” — was not selected as a
part of the solution. As a result, this factor is not the one that needs to be invoked for
the political spectrum design. Indeed, xenophobic inclinations can be attributed to any
political doctrine on the left as well as on the right.

At first sight, it may seem like the exclusion of the factor "planned economy" is
an anomaly in the model. However, such is not the case. Some exotic socialist currents
exclude the state and all services associated with it from their doctrine. The existence of
such political theories in the model has effectively eliminated PE from the parsimonious
solution.

Now let us plug in fascism and national socialism back into the QCA model with
the following scores of memberships in the outcome set: for fascism – 0.67 and national
socialism – 1. Then we will recalculate a truth table. Fascism is assigned a score of 0.67
as an acknowledgment that, at least in theory, fascists proclaimed to be forming a
society that was neither right nor left.

The standard analysis of the Truth Table (Tab. 7) led to virtually the same
solution, with high coefficients of coverage 0.97 and consistency 0.94, described by the
formula (1). Once again, it is essential to remind that formula (1) determines that CC,

30

WR, and CC are sufficient conditions that bend a political ideology to the left. Are these
conditions also necessary? In order to answer this question, QCA provides an analysis
of the necessary condition.

A necessity test was performed by the same software that was used in the Truth
Table analysis. The result is presented in Tab. 8. The consistency score was sorted in
descending order. By applying a liberal cut-off value of 0.85, we see that only three
individual conditions have passed the necessity test. Neither “planned economy” nor
“nationalism/racism” make a cut.

Thus, it can be summed up that socialization of property, wealth redistribution,
and collectivization of consciousness are necessary and sufficient conditions, and any of
them, when TRUE, uniquely identifies Left political philosophy. Consequently, these
findings lead to a comprehensive definition of socialism.

31

Socialism is a set of socio-economic systems which are characterized by varying degrees of
socialization of property, subjugation of individual consciousness, and scale of wealth
redistribution, imposed on society by revolutionary or ruling elites without majority consent.

The next question that needs to be answered is what configurations of conditions
influence right-wing ideology. For that, it is necessary to analyze the Truth Table, where
the outcome is denoted as ~Left (NOT Left is Right). The algorithm to find the solution
remains the same and brings results similar to formula (1). That is,

~CP + ~WR + ~CC à ~Left

(3)

where “+” is OR operand, “à” is subset operand.

The formula reads that respect for private property rights, the negation of wealth
redistribution, and cherishing of individual freedom are sufficient conditions that bend
a political ideology to the right. If any of these conditions happened to be TRUE, the
political doctrine is defined as right-wing. The analysis of necessary conditions shows
that ~CP and ~WR are statistically valid, whereas ~CC has a low consistency level of
0.78. As the number of cases of the right-wing ideologies that enter a model is small,
these cases are allowed a lower consistency threshold for the necessity test.
Nevertheless, if strictly applied, this condition is sufficient but not necessary.

Anarchism as libertarianism also advocates for individual freedom, and it seems
that this factor alone would not distinguish between political doctrines. However, a
stateless society advocated by anarchists does not guarantee a degree of individual

32

freedom promoted by libertarians. It is not a prerequisite that the collectivization of
consciousness should be organized only by the forces of state coercion. The human
community itself can subjugate the individual to a collective either forcefully or by
persuasion.

Anarcho-communism was first materialized in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 during
the Revolution in the Russian Empire (Voline, 2019). Stateless, multinational
communities were organized on a Free Territory in South-East Ukraine that accounted
for approximately seven million people. They lived during a time of extreme calamities
under the protection and strict regulation of Nestor Makhno’s Revolutionary
Insurrectionary Army. Anarchists conducted a social experiment by building a society
according to their theoretical provisions but under the umbrella of powerful military
forces. The population was subordinated to the dominant political idea that prevailed in
these territories. That is why the membership score in “Collectivization of
Consciousness” for anarchists is 0.67 instead of 0.

Thus, anarchists' call for liberty does not preclude the collectivization of
consciousness. Moreover, it will be shown further that full personal liberty cannot be
achieved without complete economic freedom. Even so, anarcho-communists carried
out a policy of socialization of private property. Therefore, a degree of freedom attained
by anarchists does not reach the bar set by the libertarians.

The solution for the outcome “right” exhibits complete symmetry with the
answer derived for “left," that is as follows:

33

CP + WR + CC à Left are mirror reflections of ~CP + ~WR + ~CC à ~Left.

This fact gives us the right to assert that all three conditions affect the
polarization of the entire political spectrum. Thus, we have found the factors that can be
used in the construction of objective spectrograms. Given one dependent variable —
political spectrum — and three independent variables — CP, WR, and CC — the
spectrum would be four-dimensional. However, it is impossible to visualize a fourdimensional space. That is why it is necessary to sacrifice one dimension, i.e., one
parameter has to be eliminated. The best candidate for such elimination is WR —
wealth redistribution.

It can be assumed that the redistribution of wealth is a form of systematic and
gradual encroachment on private property. Suppose an entrepreneur has a capital C,
which makes a profit P. The state confiscates part of the profit in favor of others, using
progressive taxation; therefore, the profit becomes P ', where P' < P. An entrepreneur
could earn a profit P' having a smaller capital C,' that is, C '< C, with no progressive tax.
Therefore, the state reduces the productive capital of a businessman by the amount (C C '). Wealth redistribution is latent socialization of the means of production. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that wealth redistribution is reflected in the parameter
“collectivization of property.” That is why it is safe to eliminate WR from the model
without significant deficiency.

The new formulae would be as follows:

34

CP + CC à Left
~CP + ~CC à ~Left

(4)

It reads that collectivization of property or assault on individual freedom defines the
left political doctrine. Inversely, respect for private property rights or personal freedom
defines the right ideology.

Now, it is possible to build a political spectrogram in three-dimensional space.
Let us denote an axis X as “Economic Freedom,” an axis Y as “Individual Freedom,”
and an axis Z as “Political Spectrum.” Political Spectrum has a range from 0 to 1, where
point 0 corresponds to the left and point 1 to the right. The axes X and Y also have a unit
length. Specific values for each political philosophy are derived from membership
assessments for CP and CC conditions, which corresponds to “Economic Freedom” and
“Individual Freedom” (Tab. 1). However, for better visibility, we will take inverse
value: 1 becomes 0, 0.33 becomes 0.67, and so forth. Figure 1 presents the theoretical
spectrogram of political ideologies in three-dimensional space.

The graph has the form of a falling leaf, in which the upper end corresponds to the
parameters of the ideologies leaning to the right wing. Thus, at the very peak are
political philosophies advocating for maximum personal and entrepreneurial freedom.
As the values of individual and economic liberties decrease, the leaf is getting more
extensive on center, and then it reaches the bottom end. The bottom end corresponds to
the totalitarian ideologies with minimum values for personal and economic freedoms.
All other ideologies are located on a body of the leaf between these two extremes.
However, each one has its respective mark on the spectrum axis. Therefore, different
combinations of economic and personal freedoms correspond to a particular spot in the
political spectrum.

36

It should be recognized that the 3D representation of the spectrogram is still not
convenient for analysis and comprehension. In order to simplify visualization, it is
better to represent a 3D figure on the 2D plane. In order to do this, let us cut the 3D
figure by planes that are parallel to a coordinate plane X, Y (economic freedom,
individual freedom). Every cutting plane produces plane sections that are called
contour lines. A contour line for a function of two variables is a curve that connects
points where the function has the same particular value. Thus, every contour line will
correspond with the value of the same spectrum.

Figure 2 represents the contour lines of the political spectrum that are cut with a
pitch of 0.2. The graph is divided into five regions that are characterized by an equal
spectrum range in each region. Indeed, different combinations of X and Y values can

37

determine entry into an area with the same spectrum range. The upper right corner
corresponds to political philosophies that are distinguished by high values for the
individual and economic freedom. These are real right-wing ideologies that occupy a
relatively small area and have political spectrum values from 0.8 to 1.0.

The right-wing ideologies occupy a plateau separated from the centrist ones by a
steep slope. It derives from the small interval between adjacent contour lines with
spectrum values 0.6 and 0.4. Further, the spectrum expands as the distance between
contour lines increases. Thus, left-centrist and hardcore left-wing ideologies are located
on a wide gentle slope. This is an indicator that the spectrum inflates to the left. The left
totalitarian regimes are at the bottom, having individual freedom and economic
freedom values close to zeroes. Authoritarian regimes have a low magnitude of
individual freedom and moderate values for economic freedom. They are located to the
right of the totalitarian regimes and below centrists.

The upper-left and bottom-right areas are marked as impossible corners. The
former has a high degree of individual freedom and a minimal magnitude of economic
freedom; the latter has a high level of economic freedom and a low level of individual
freedom. The reason for this conclusion follows from the presence of a positive
correlation between the degree of individual freedom and the level of economic
freedom.

Economic Freedom

The concept of the socialization of private property and the collectivization of
consciousness in a broad sense can be most adequately described by indices of
economic freedom and individual freedom, calculated in the framework of the Human
Freedom Index. The Human Freedom Index describes the state of human freedom in
the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic
freedom. The report is co-published by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the
Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (Ian Vásquez &
Tanja Porčnik, 2018).

Correlation analysis between two vectors of freedom determined a significant
degree of a positive correlation between them, r=0.67. It means that the increase in the
level of economic freedom leads to an increase in individual freedom and vice versa.

39

The equation of the fitted line plot (Fig. 3) essentially reads Y=X. The line is a diagonal
because the angle of inclination with respect to the axis X is 45 degrees. It means that an
increase in the amount of economic freedom per unit leads to an increase in individual
freedom per unit. When economic freedom is at its maximum, one should see
maximum individual freedom. Correspondingly, a minimum of economic freedom
predetermines a minimum of individual freedom. Therefore, the upper left and the
bottom right corners, which correspond to a minimum of economic freedom and a
maximum of individual freedom, from one hand, and a maximum of economic freedom
and a minimum of individual freedom, from another side, constitute an impossible
combination. Collectivist anarchists would never achieve a maximum of personal
liberty having a low degree of economic freedom. A coarse despotism will never create
a society with a high level of economic freedom.

The indices of economic and individual freedoms act as proxies for theoretical
concepts of the socialization of private property and the collectivization of
consciousness. They were calculated for individual countries instead of distinct political
philosophies. What kind of external index could serve to provide values in the first
approximation for the conceptual left-right political spectrum? The historical data
suggests that right-wing political theories are responsible for inducing democratic
transformation in society. At the same time, various left-wing ideologies tend to build
up totalitarian and authoritarian states. That is why it is plausible to utilize an Index of
Democracy to represent a political spectrum polarization by countries roughly.

The Democracy Index is a product of a UK-based company called Economist
Intelligence Unit (EUI) (Democracy Index, 2018). The index classifies countries by four
40

categories: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian
regimes. Thus, indices for the analysis were created by different institutions and
employed a unique methodology. After the direct recalibration of index data into the
interval [0,1], it became possible to build a 3D graph of Degree of Democracy vs.
Individual and Economic Freedoms (Fig. 4). The first thing that catches one's eyes is the
similarity of the leaf-shaped graph with the theoretical surface on Fig. 1. Closer to the
center and the bottom, the surface became more wrinkled, which is expected for the
unprocessed data. However, the trend remains the same. Countries with high values of
economic and individual freedoms occupy the plateau. Totalitarian states are at the
bottom; whereas in the middle, there are countries with mix regimes.

It is most clearly seen in the contour plot (Fig. 5). The graph has retained a
feature depictured for the political spectrum (Fig. 2). Five zones are divided by the
contour line with different degrees of democracy. There are some irregularities that, for
the most part, could be explained by the differences in estimates and opinions of data
by experts. Thus, developers of the Human Freedom Index assigned a low score of
economic freedom for Argentina, but EUI experts set a high for the degree of
democracy. Argentina is a clear outlier. On the opposite side, there are Bahrain and
UAE, which are classified as authoritarian regimes (which is correct) but score pretty
high in the level of economic freedom. These countries should be placed closer to Saudi
Arabia, which bears the same political, economic, and cultural characteristics.
Nevertheless, regardless of a few outliers, the graph demonstrates that there are no
countries with a high level of individual freedom while simultaneously having a low
degree of economic freedom. The combination - high value of economic freedom and
the low level of individual freedom - is implausible as well.

Economic Freedom

Countries in the upper right corner enjoy economic prosperity. Their average per
capita income ($39,249) is significantly higher than those in other quartiles; the average
per capita income in the least-free quartile is $12,026 (Vásquez & Porčnik, 2018).

The right-wing ideology, which builds on the notion of freedom and respect for
private property, creates a prosperous society. Whereas, proponents of the left ideology
of collectivization of private property and consciousness run societies to the misery. A
state of affairs in Venezuela is a vivid example as they slipped into gloom within two
decades. It should be noted that even in developed, industrial countries there is a
continuous political battle between the keepers of a status quo – the rightists – and
proponents of "change" – the leftists. The war of ideologies goes with varying success.

43

However, the graph shows that if the leftist idea wins, there is only one direction from
the comfortable plateau – the road to downhill.

Now, let us draw a schematic plot of the political spectrum, bearing in mind
features that have been discovered. The upper-left and lower-right areas are impossible
corners. The upper-right region with a maximum degree of both freedoms is instead a
tiny spot that only about two dozen societies have been able to occupy. The spectrum is
inflated to the left; thus, a center part with a mixed degree of both freedoms is rather
large. The packet of utter misery is on the lower-left corner. The area is much smaller
compared with the centrists’ area but more prominent than the area of prosperity. Lines
of the political spectrum values delimit each area.

44

Conclusion

When building a political-philosophical spectrogram, scientists faced many
obstacles, many of which were ideological. The shape of the graph was influenced by
the compiler’s personal preferences and biases. The most challenging task was
appointing suitable positions for anarchism, fascism, and Nazism. Different factors,
dimensions, axes, and cardinal points have been used in different political
spectrograms. Most often, the graphics do not complement each other, and it seems that

45

each of them describes an entirely different reality. There was an urgent need to
conduct an objective analysis of political philosophies and find the factors that influence
the political spectrum’s polarization. Finding such conditions would determine the
geometric dimensions of the spectrogram and its principal axes. For these purposes, the
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was used, as it allows the introduction of a
fraction of objectivity due to the use of a formalized mathematical apparatus of the
theory of sets.

QCA helps to identify the most concise causal conditions that influence the
bending of an ideology to one or another side. Thus, it is obtained that spectrum
polarization depends on three conditions: CP - attitude to private property, CC individual freedom, and WR - wealth redistribution. It should be noted that these
factors are both sufficient and necessary and statistically confident. They influence both
wings of the political spectrum. The ideology is left leaning if it advocates for the
socialization of private property, collectivization of consciousness, and generous wealth
redistribution. These three factors determine different paths to socialism, and even if at
least one of them gets involved, then the ideology or regime is the left. Communists
utilized all three ways to achieve a “paradise”; evolutionary socialists operate wealth
redistribution as the primary path; national socialists and fascists use subjugation of the
individual to collective and wealth redistribution; collectivist anarchists were engaged
in the collectivization of property. On the contrary, the ideology is right leaning if it
respects private property and individual freedom and declines excessive wealth
redistribution.

46

With firmly determined factors that influence the political spectrum polarization,
it becomes possible to build a spectrogram unambiguously. However, a function of
three variables can be presented only in four-dimensional space, which is quite
challenging to visualize. Therefore, one condition has to be eliminated. The wealth
redistribution can be regarded as an inherently latent collectivization of the means of
production. That is why its influence can be reflected in the socialization of property.
Moreover, the Economic Freedom Index has already considered such an impact of
governmental monetary and fiscal actions.

A spectrogram can be conveniently presented as a contour plot where each
contour line divides the graph into regions. The graph resembles the trimmed Nolan
chart as it is utilized the same axes; however, it should be remembered that it is a 2D
representation of the 3D surface, which reflects "left-right" polarization of the political
spectrum. The political spectrum ranges from 0 to 1, where the left-leaning political
philosophies are grouped closer to 0, and the right-wingers are in the proximity of 1.
These adjacent areas are distinguished by a different range of the political spectrum. In
our example, the values of the political spectrum from 0.8 to 1 are occupied by the rightwing ideologies. On the opposite end, an interval between 0 and 0.2 is reserved for
hardcore left doctrines. The rest of the political philosophies are in between. Therefore,
even though a contour plot is in 2D, which, in turn, was obtained from 3D, it is still
possible to classify doctrines along the left-right axis, which is especially convenient for
a layperson.

It is very plausible to use economic and individual freedom indices as a proxy to
the causal factors in our model. Very roughly, an Index of Democracy can be used as a
47

representation of political spectrum polarization. Nevertheless, using those indices in
the model showed a good match between the theory and reality. There is a significant
positive correlation between two vectors of freedom. It means that an increase in the
magnitude of one lead to a rise in another. The regression line has a form of Y=X, which
effectively eliminates two combinations of factors from consideration. Thus, max
economic freedom cannot coincide with min individual freedom. Also, max individual
freedom is incomparable with min economic freedom. These combinations of factorsvalues are reflected in the graphs as impossible corners. Therefore, spectrograms
schematically can be presented in the shape of a leaf crossed by spectrum lines. A user
can plot different ideologies and regimes on the graph and grade them along available
axes, including one-dimensional classification as well.
