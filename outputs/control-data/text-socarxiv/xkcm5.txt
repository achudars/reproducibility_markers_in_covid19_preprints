Abstract
The dimensions, outcomes and impacts of North-South migration need study in many developing nations. Yet unstudied is Western migration to the Philippines, a developing nation with numerous disadvantages for residents and from which many locals emigrate. The present study aimed to estimate numbers and demographic characteristics of Westerners living there and some motives for and outcomes of their move. From various embassy estimates, perhaps 218,350 Westerners not of Filipino descent lived in the Philippines in 2014. Some Western migrants were studied in- country and 134 completed a survey. Most survey respondents were well-educated male retirees who had paired up with a local woman. Major migration motives were low living costs, a warm climate, dislike of a home nation and availability of attractive partners. Reported outcomes of moving to the Philippines varied greatly. Some do not adjust well and quickly leave while others are dissatisfied but lack funds to exit. However, some apparently integrate well. Local impacts of the Western influx mainly seem slight to date but may grow. This study gives some useful data for policy makers and this paper discusses emerging problems for governments linked to the increasing North-South flow.  

Key Words: North-South migration. Westerners. Philippines. Integration.

 






Migration between the developed Global North (wealthy nations such as Switzerland and Australia) and the less developed Global South (poorer nations such as Panama and Ecuador) mostly flows from South to North*. However, there is some North-South traffic. There are return migrants (King et al. 2010) and Westerners who take well-paid “expat” jobs arranged offshore (Farrer 2010; Lan 2011). Cohen (1984) and Howard (2009) describe an unusual flow of “marginal” Westerners to Thailand, non-retiree former tourists attracted by Thai lifestyle and culture who live precariously in-country for years with insecure visa status and poorly paid local jobs.  Westerners increasingly retire to developing nations (Warnes 2001; Otero 1997) and optimistic popular books encourage and advise on such a move (Telecky and Bryce 2006; Goldberg 2012; Wyatt and Ryan 2014). 	
North-South migration is of research interest for several reasons.  First, much is an intriguing “man bites dog” phenomenon. Migrants often shift between countries for economic and safety reasons. North-South migrants accept the corruption, poor infrastructure, poverty and lack of rule of law characteristic of many developing nations. Why do they make this apparently counter-intuitive move? 
Second, the North-South flow is sizeable and apparently is growing.  Laczko and Brian (2013) estimated between seven and 13 million migrants from the Global North living in the Global South, although many are return migrants. Indeed, some governments now explicitly encourage wealthy foreigners to settle and organizations such as International Living strongly promote it. For example, Malaysia has a “second home” scheme (Toyota and Xiang 2012) and the Philippines has a Retirement Authority with various concessions for foreigners. The flow raises important policy issues and governments need data about migrant numbers, motives and outcomes. Receiving nations may underestimate migrant numbers because many live on successive tourist visas. Governments may not fully understand the migrants, and need data to better prepare or even discourage migrants. Some Westerners are ending up destitute and homeless in developing nations, perhaps after being cheated by locals (Howard 2009). They may have been poorly informed by how-to-migrate books and may underestimate living costs, the drawbacks of life in a developing nation, and their own physical and mental needs with advancing age.  Some reportedly move without ever before having left their home country.  
Researchers have tackled various North-South migration issues; who the migrants are, why they go, how well migrants integrate, how the move works out, and the economic, social and ecological impacts on the receiving nation. A major focus has been migration motives and some key findings are as follows. As mentioned, some migrate for a well-paid job. Some seek adventure or a life change and hope to live better (Lan 2011; Benson 2015). Researchers have coined the terms “lifestyle” and “amenity” migration to label a move motivated by a wish for a better life, perhaps propelled by various imaginaries (Benson 2015; Viteri 2015). Many actually migrate for economic reasons. They are unable to live comfortably at home, partly due to the neoliberal onslaught on working conditions and pensions (Hayes 2014). Some dislike aspects of their home nation such as its politics, or are drawn by a warm climate and a particular developing nation’s culture (Howard 2009).  
Most migrants studied are couples but Gambold (2013) describes a flow of older, single women to such nations as Mexico, often for low living costs.  Thailand, known for sex tourism (Oppermann 1999), attracts single male migrants searching for partners (Howard 2008). They may visit the nation frequently as a sex tourist and eventually retire there, perhaps pairing up with a local. 
Research suggests that many migrants may integrate little, staying in foreigner enclaves and not learning the local language (Howard 2009; Garriz Fernandez 2011). The migration may have positive and negative impacts on locals.  Migrants may bring new skills into a community. But Americans moving to Latin America may inflate land and services prices, overtax health and social services, and strain water supplies (Jackiewicz and Craine 2015; Viteri 2015). Indeed, wealthy and racially different migrants may reproduce Western privilege, mirroring a former colonial arrangement, and distort a local economy (Garriz Fernandez 2011).
Differences across nations
Migration motives, experiences in-country, outcomes and impacts may differ greatly in different developing nations. Indeed, the International Living organization’s Annual Global Retirement Index rates different nations’ desirability as destinations based on such factors as living costs and government regulations. Ease of living, acceptance of foreigners, and visa and land ownership policies vary and can change quickly. Permanent residence remains difficult in some nations, particularly in Southeast Asia. Green (2015) describes how many Westerners living in Indonesia and Thailand periodically must visit neighbouring countries to renew visas. Thailand recently tightened visa policies to reduce foreigner numbers and in 2018 has been rounding up and deporting over-stayers. In 2015 Cambodia cracked down on Western over-stayers (Anonymous 2015) and in 2017 made 12 month visas more difficult to obtain. Some nations forbid foreigners buying land and single male migrants pairing up with a local may have special problems.  Foreigners may put land in a local partner’s name, later to be unceremoniously evicted (Howard 2009).  
Because of these and other differences, migration to a variety of developing nations needs study. The Philippines is a developing nation with a flow of some yet- unstudied Western migrants. The nation reputedly is foreigner-friendly and the East/West cultural gap apparently is less than elsewhere in Southeast Asia, perhaps enabling easier Westerner integration than in, say, Cambodia. It has a reputation for sex tourism and some single males retire there after many tourist visits. Another instance of a sex tourism- linked flow deserves study.  
Furthermore, the nation is an unlikely expat destination, with a high local emigration rate. Although it has friendly, welcoming people and fine tropical beaches, it is densely populated, with high crime rates, unsafe roads, grinding poverty and a questionable rule of law. 
There are little data about this Western influx. Researchers to date mostly have examined the large Filipino diaspora overseas, tackling such issues as effects on family members left behind (Tyner 2009; Yoon 2014; Lam & Yeoh 2018) and return migration (Yang 2006; Go 2012). The few studies of migration to the Philippines examine migrants from Asia (Tigno 2001; Asis 2008). However, there are some popular how-to-migrate books, partly based on a Westerner’s own experiences (Elterman 2008; McMurrain 2014). Burgess (2013) described his 2.5 year stay in-country, eventually concluding that the negatives of living in the Philippines outweighed the positives.  
	Therefore, this interesting instance of North-South migration deserves study. The present study had two major aims. The first was to estimate the number of Westerners living in the Philippines. The second was to determine some motives for their migration, migrants’ experiences in-country, their perceived integration and their migration outcomes. 
The Philippines
	The Philippines consists of 7,107 tropical islands with a land area of about 300,000 square kilometres and about 100 million people. With a GNI per capita of U.S. $2,842 in 2014, the World Bank classifies it as a lower middle-income nation.
It was colonized by Spain from the 16th Century until 1898 and then by the United States until independence in 1946. The American legacy persists. English is the language of commerce, many signs are in English, and many locals speak it. Bulloch and Fabinyi (2009) argue that many Filipinos idealize the United States as a paradise and strive to move there. Indeed, the 2010 United States census lists 3.4 million residents of Filipino descent. The United States maintained military bases in the Philippines after 1946. Two large ones (Subic Bay and Clark Field) were closed in the early 1990s. Thousands of American military personnel served there and some later retired to the Philippines. Sex industries grew up around these bases and they became sex tourism destinations.  Millions of Filipinos work overseas in many nations, remitting billions of dollars home each year. The government actively encourages this exodus (King et al. 2010).  
	The Philippines had 4,681,307 tourist arrivals in 2013. South Korea was the largest source nation, with 24.9% of that total, followed by the United States with 14.41%.	 
Study 1: Estimating the Number of Westerners
Study 1 aimed to estimate how many Westerners live in the Philippines. Such estimates are notoriously difficult to make (O’Reilly 2000). The 2010 Philippines census lists 54,246 Western citizens resident (see Table 1) but this and other official figures may greatly underestimate the real total.  Many live in-country only part of the year and many reside for years on successive tourist visas. The author could get no official estimates from the Philippines Immigration Department.
However, Tigno (2001) and Asis (2008) give some migrant numbers. Tigno (2001) gained some official statistics (which may underestimate actual numbers) to 1999.  He stated that little data are available before 1996. In 1999, there were 3,293 foreign retirees, fewer than before the 1997 financial crisis. In October 1999, 17,521 foreigners were classed as permanent residents. About 55.6% were from the United States, 9.1% from China, and 5.5% from Japan.  In 1999, 2,635 “alien” employment permits were issued, down from 6,055 in 1997 and 3,697 in 1998. Most “alien” employees were from Asia. 
Method
	 In April, 2014 the author contacted all Western embassies or consulates in Manila (see Table 1 for nations considered Western), and asked three questions; 
1. How many [of your e.g. German, Australian, etc.] citizens are living in the Philippines?
2. How many of those are of Filipino descent? 
3. How many are retirees?
Results
	Some had no data and a few did not reply. The Irish consulate had only a total of those registered, which was doubled for an overall estimate because many citizens do not register. Switzerland requires citizens residing for a year or more to register and its registered total was used as an overall estimate. The Swiss consulate also had estimates for Liechtenstein residents, whose local interests it covers. The German embassy stated that it had no data but Friedrich (2008) cited an embassy estimate of about 5000 Germans living in the Philippines in 2007 with 1031 receiving an official pension. Those numbers, probably underestimates in 2014, were used here. 
	The United States embassy replied as follows; ‘... there are approximately more than 300,000 U.S. citizens, visitors and residents, which also includes a large presence of United States veterans, in the Philippines at any given time. An estimated 600,000 Americans visit the Philippines each year. [Actually 674,564 tourist arrivals in 2013 according to the Philippines Government] ... we do not have any statistical information on the different groups of U.S. citizens visiting the Philippines’.  
	If there were 674,564 U.S. tourists in 2013 and each stayed for an average two weeks that implies about 26,000 tourists there at any given time and subtracting 26,000 from 300,000 gives a very rough estimate of 274,000 residents. (Table 1 about here)
	Table 1 presents government tourist arrival and census data and embassy estimates.  Five Western nations figure prominently in the tourist arrival and census figures, with the United States having roughly half of the totals.  For some nations with no embassy estimates, we can get very rough estimates with a nearest neighbour method. The Norwegian embassy estimated that 3000 Norwegians are residents. Table 1 shows that Sweden had about the same number of tourist arrivals and census residents as Norway (although Sweden has double the home population), which would suggest roughly 3000 Swedish residents.  Similarly, Denmark has about two thirds of the tourist arrivals and census numbers as Norway and taking two thirds of the Norway estimate of 3000 gives 2010 Danish residents as a very rough estimate. Australia and New Zealand are culturally quite similar. The percentage of New Zealand tourist arrivals compared to Australian arrivals is about 9.67% and of census residents is about 7.41% and if we take the average of these (8.54%) and apply it to the midpoint of the Australian embassy range, it would suggest very roughly 1323 New Zealand residents. Putting these numbers together with the midpoint of ranges given by some embassies gives a total of 341,050. Adding 4000 more for the nations with no estimates gives about 345,000 Western citizens resident as a very rough estimate.
	But many actually are of Filipino descent, being Filipino returnees or mixed-race children of foreigners.  Most embassies had no data on how many citizen residents were of Filipino descent. The U.K. consulate said “minimal” and the Norwegian embassy said “many”. The six figures given in Table 1 vary widely, from 15% to 80% of their actual embassy estimated totals. The numbers for Liechtenstein are tiny and were excluded here. The average percentage of residents of Filipino descent for the remaining five nations is about 36.71% of the embassy estimate and subtracting 36.71% of the 345,000 gives a very rough estimate of 218,350 of non-Filipino descent. This 36.71% value probably is an underestimate because Americans are much of the resident total. Probably more than 36.71% of American citizen residents are of Filipino descent. 
	Few embassies had estimates of retiree numbers and these varied greatly.  
	The overall estimate should be considered only as a very rough approximation. However, it is better than the census data, which greatly under-estimate actual numbers. 
Study 2: Migrant Demographics, Motives, Experiences and Outcomes
	Study 2 aimed to determine some demographic characteristics of Western migrants, and their migration motives, experiences and outcomes.  
Method
	Data were collected in several ways. The author scanned many expat online forums, websites and newsgroups in the Philippines (such as Living in Cebu and Orient Expat). The author carried out fieldwork in-country in 2008 and over two months from early December 2009 to February 2010. Expats are scattered throughout the archipelago and the author visited all main islands, traveling from Laoag in the far north (see Howard, 2012, for a detailed route map). This fieldwork involved observing and speaking to Western expats encountered, discussing their motives and experiences. Islands visited were Luzon, Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, Mindanao, Negros, Panay, Boracay, Mindoro and Palawan. The author stayed at least a few days in each of popular expat cities Manila, Baguio, Angeles City, Dumaguete, Bacolod, Iloilo, Cebu City, and Davao. Brief notes on observations and expat conversations were taken during the day and expanded on at night. However, no specific interview schedule was used. The data mainly were used as a check on online survey data. 
The main data source was a 36- question online survey, which is presented in Appendix 1. Brief ads explaining the study purpose and inviting eligible respondents to click on a link to the survey form were placed on various expat websites and forums, such as Living in Cebu forum, Dumaguete forum, Alloexpats, and the newsgroups soc.culture.filipino, soc.retirement, and rec.travel.asia. The ad stated that the survey was for Westerners not of Filipino descent who currently resided in the Philippines and had lived there for at least one year.  A Western migrant was defined in a questionnaire heading which stated that a respondent should complete the form only if;  
“A. You are from a Western nation, such as the United States, Germany, Australia, Israel, South Africa and so on. 
B. You were not born in the Philippines and are not of Filipino descent. 
C. You currently live in The Philippines and have done so for at least 12 months, excluding trips of a few weeks to another nation. Your exact visa status is not important.”
	The survey form asked for demographic data, reasons for moving to the Philippines, and about experiences in-country.  Some questions were open- ended and some had an option to expand on answers. The survey form went online on May 15, 2014 and data were analysed up to November 6, 2014, by which time postings were few. The questionnaire is available from the author. 
	The author examined each survey response and eliminated three. One respondent no longer lived in-country, one had lived there only briefly and the third answered few questions. This left 134 usable responses.  Some respondents did not answer every question and respondent numbers for such questions are given. 
Results
Who migrates to the Philippines and why? The author’s subjective impression from fieldwork observations was that many Western residents are American, older males, often attracted by low living costs and partner availability. Few are female, because the nation has few attractions for them.
	Table 2 presents demographic data of survey respondents and Table 3 presents their visa status and income sources. Most respondents are male and on average are quite well-educated and reasonably prosperous retirees. Nearly half are from the United States. The median age is 56 years old (range 25 to 82 years, n=133). Most (55.97%) are self-described retirees. Of the 74/75 retirees giving their age, the median was 62 years (range 36 to 82). Most were married to a Filipino or had a live-in Filipino partner. Of the three females, one was married to a Filipino, one to a non-Filipino, and one was single. Most hold at least a bachelor’s degree. Previous or current occupations listed include university professor and engineer.
(Tables 2 and 3 about here)
	Table 2 shows that most live in the popular expat locales of Manila, Cebu City, Dumaguete, and Angeles City. Some are employed locally but most live off a retirement pension and, or savings and investments. Five work over the Internet and a few reported working in another nation for part of the year. Their median stated annual income was U.S. $45,000 (range was $10,000 to a claimed $2 million, n=73). The median annual income for the retirees stating an income was $36,000 (range was $10,000 to $300,000, n=40).
	Their median length of stay in-country was four years (range was 1 to 32 years, n=130). Nearly half were on successive tourist visas and 51.49% stated that they had lived in another developing nation, citing India, Ecuador, Thailand, China, Brazil and others. 
Table 4 presents stated migration motives. The key survey question had seven alternatives to check and an ‘other’ option. Each alternative could be expanded on in a text box and any number of motives could be cited. Later open-ended questions asked for the major advantages of and what they liked most about living in the Philippines. 
(Table 4 about here.)
	The most commonly stated migration lures by far were low living costs and the climate.  Some comments were ‘...  pension adequate to live here, not in U. S.’, ‘To survive on a low income’, ‘... everything here is super-cheap’, ‘Had to quit working to care for ill spouse. Could not afford to do that in U.S.’, and ‘… disliked the European climate. I had also got spoiled whilst living in Hong Kong with servants’. Some had come to an expat job arranged overseas and 17.91% had a Filipino partner who had wanted to return. A few met a Filipina online and moved to the Philippines to be with her. Only 15.67% cited the ready availability of attractive sexual partners as a lure and most of these were single. One comment was ‘Attractive women that like me and the cost of living’. 
	Some also disliked their home country. Some comments were; ‘Too much red tape, taxation. Government watches your every move’ and ‘We were very dissatisfied with the U.S. in general’. An open-ended question asked for what they missed least about life in the West and some comments were; ‘High cost of living and too much work and not enough holiday time’, ‘A life that revolves around work’, ‘Surveillance state, taxation, extreme political correctness’, ‘Extreme striving for material wealth’, and ‘Cold weather, cops on every corner ready to write a ticket, unfriendly and rude people’. 	
	Only 31.34% cited the Filipino lifestyle as a drawcard and only 20.90% cited the lifestyle and people as what they liked best about living in the nation. Some comments were; ‘Relaxed, laid-back, slower’, ‘Loved the people’, ‘I enjoy living among the Filipino people’, ‘People here are generally friendly and can speak reasonable English’, and ‘I think the people here are the happiest, kindest and friendliest in the world’. Additional stated motives were; ‘Low stress and low taxes’ and ‘English widely used and understood’. For the advantages of living in the Philippines, 50.00% cited the low cost of living, 28.36% the possibility of having a Filipina wife and family, and 20.15% the climate. Comments were; ‘Easy way of life’ and ‘Less stress and great family life’. 
	What did they miss most about life in the West? Some just said ‘Nothing’ but 19.40% cited the food and 15.67% cited family and friends. Comments were; ‘People obeying laws and rules’, ‘... parks, playgrounds, cleanliness’, ‘Intellectual conversations’, ‘Non-Mafia police, sane driving, unblocked sidewalks, people who speak English’ and ‘Mental kinship’.
On the main problems experienced, 10.45% cited health care (high cost, low quality). Comments were; ‘Most medical facilities are unclean and have low-skilled practitioners’ and ‘You have to pay for all medical care upfront. No money. No care’. Others cited legal problems; ‘Westerners have no rights in legal disputes with a Filipino. You will lose’. On what they liked least about living in the Philippines, corruption was most often cited, followed by trash and general lack of cleanliness.  The local cuisine, which many foreigners dislike, was cited by 6.72%.  Comments were; ‘Greedy, corrupt officials’,  ‘Constant scams’, ‘The food sucks and you are viewed as a cow to be milked’, ‘… discrimination that a foreigner deals with every time he/she steps out the door’, ‘Pollution and heat drive me nuts, along with the traffic’, ‘Too many fake friends. Too many requests for money’, ‘Insane traffic’, ‘Lack of pride in workmanship’ and ‘Nobody seems to want to do anything well or better’.
	The Philippines has a dangerous and lawless reputation, with many guns, high crime rates, reports of forced disappearances, death squads, and extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. An Internet poster stated ‘Here, just about everyone goes into some level of lockdown at night’. Another poster stated that Filipinos usually move into gated communities when they can afford it. Foreigners cannot own land and may put a house in a partner’s name and anecdotes abound about Filipinas conspiring to kill, deport or imprison foreign husbands by false (or true) accusations. 
(Table 5 about here.)
About one third of survey respondents reported crime as a concern (see Table 5) but nearly half were unconcerned. Comments were; ‘Yes, many shootings and murders which are never solved’, ‘Many thieves and low-level crimes’, ‘There is never an opportunity to let your guard down’, ‘Need to be very security aware all the time’ and ‘Limitation of personal freedom due to danger of crimes’.  Table 5 shows that nearly 40% had been a crime victim.  Comments were; ‘Have been held up at knife point’, ‘Burgled twice’, ‘Yes, but no violent crime. Theft and con schemes are common’,  ‘Gold chain snatched from around my neck’, ‘Pick pocket gang once in Manila’, ‘ATM card skimmed’, and ‘In three years I have been robbed seven times’.
As might be expected, concern about crime was higher for respondents living in the large cities of Manila and Cebu. Of the 41 respondents concerned about crime, 11 lived in Manila (out of a total 22 living in Manila) and 11 in Cebu (of the 29 living there).  But 12 respondents reporting a concern lived in rural areas or in smaller cities such as Ormoc and Iloilo.    
How well integrated are the Westerners?  Several survey questions tapped respondents’ perceived integration, defined here as often socializing with and being accepted by locals, feeling part of the local society, learning the language and perhaps adopting some local customs. By the criterion of having a local partner (one index of integration, and which may occur only with the acculturated second generation, according to Alba and Nee 1997), many were well-integrated. That partner also can ease entry into Filipino society, and indeed some respondents reported socializing mainly with the partner’s friends and family.
	 Table 6 presents data on aspects of perceived integration. Many respondents personally felt accepted by locals but nearly half did not or were in between. Comments were; ‘Many Filipinos are very suspicious of foreigners’, ‘They see us only as being easy to part with our money’, ‘... too much discrimination against foreigners here’, and ‘I sit in my front porch smiling and waving. People look at me like an ape in the zoo’.
	Many reported socializing mostly with other foreigners or in the bar scene and a few said they did not socialize at all. Some comments were; [I socialize mostly] ‘With foreigners with Filipino wives’ and ‘Wife’s friends and family’, ‘Mix of other foreigners, Filipino friends and family’, and ‘Foreigners with Filipina wives’.  Most reported good or excellent knowledge of Filipino culture and about half wanted to learn more about it.
(Tables 6 and 7 about here.)
	 Table 7 presents ratings of well-being. Most described their own well-being and the overall quality of life for foreigners in the Philippines as excellent or good. One respondent stated ‘Most Westerners seem happy enough. Local girls take care of older guys with health problems’. However, some were more cautious. One said ‘Expats on modest incomes and some serious medical conditions should be very careful before opting to retire here’. Another said ‘It’s fine if you keep your wits about you and do not need a hospital’.  
	Most still were happy with their decision to migrate (Table 4) but views were polarized. Comments were; ‘I think my experience is better than most... It's a wonderful place, but individual experiences, obviously, will vary’, ‘I would advise all not to move here. ... They want your money but they don’t want you here’, ‘I hate the place.  Hate the food, hate most of the people, hate the culture’, ‘You can turn a blind eye to most of the drawbacks but in the end it wears you down’, ‘Too dangerous. The grinding poverty gets me depressed’, ‘Many other countries that have lower living costs, less hassles, seem attractive now’, and ‘It gets more frustrating the longer you stay’.  One respondent stated; ‘Retirees tend to be happy.  Foreigners working here tend not to be, due to the incompetence of staff and laziness.’
	Barriers to leaving may include cost and a Filipino partner who wants to stay. Comments were; ‘Financially unable to return to the U.S. to visit family’, ‘Life for expats in the Philippines was better before 2000. Wouldn't plan to stay if my wife wasn't a Filipina’ and ‘The Philippines is very hot, very polluted, very corrupt, has ... dangerous roads and ferries, customer service is not good (i.e. can't return things, long queues, etc.) The positive is really a lower ... cost of living ... I've lived in Ecuador and I think it's a much better place for a retiree however my wife has family here ...’.
General Discussion 
The present study aimed to estimate the number of Westerners living in the Philippines and to determine some migration motives and outcomes. To summarize, the very rough estimate of numbers was 218,350, which as noted involves making various inferences and simplifying assumptions. Key motives were low living costs, climate, dislike of a home nation, and availability of attractive partners. The move worked out well for most respondents but badly for some. 
The present study might be criticized for lack of formal interviews. Many studies in this area use only formal interviews with a few dozen migrants, often gathered from snowball sampling. There were informal interviews here, however. But online surveys usually produce similar results and here included all questions that would have been asked in formal interviews. Furthermore, the online survey allowed a wide sample from across the whole country and because it was anonymous, respondents perhaps were more likely to be truthful about migration motives (say for sexual partners) and migration outcomes.  
	The present study extends North-South migration research to a previously unstudied developing nation, gives data about another instance of a sex tourism-linked flow and gives some data on its dimensions and outcomes. Most respondents were male retirees and many were economic migrants, as various other North-South migration studies have found (Hayes 2014). The survey sample certainly is not random but probably largely reflects much of the actual Western population of older, often American, retirees, according to the author’s in-country observations.  Young Western tourists and expats are less common and less visible on the streets and in tourism destinations than in say, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia, partly because the Philippines is off the main backpacker tourist routes (Hampton and Hamzah 2016). Indeed, North-South migration often is driven by tourism. People visit first as tourists and then decide to stay on or eventually retire there. While the Philippines has tropical beaches and welcoming people, so do Thailand and Indonesia, and the latter are easier to reach and lack perceived dangers such as high crime rates. Furthermore, jobs for foreigners in the Philippines are scarce.  The English teaching mainstay popular elsewhere in Southeast Asia is rare in the Philippines because English is widely spoken.
Few respondents went to an expat job and few were “marginals”, non-retirees enamoured of Filipino lifestyle. The “marginal” migrant phenomenon may be largely restricted to Thailand, whose lifestyle is particularly attractive. A few respondents met a Filipina overseas and migrated to marry, an interesting reversal of the more usual phenomenon of Filipinas going overseas to marry (Bulloch and Fabinyi 2009).  Toyota and Thang (2012) describe an analogous flow of Japanese women migrating to Bali to marry a local. 
Migration outcomes varied greatly. Research suggests that many migrants to Western countries cannot adjust and they return home (Yang 2012; King et al. 2010). Howard (2009) and Maher and Lafferty (2014) found that Westerners’ dissatisfaction with living in Thailand grew with length of stay, with many leaving after a few years. Reasons for dissatisfaction vary. As noted, the Philippines has disadvantages compared to some other developing nations; high crime rates, unpalatable cuisine, poor driving standards and possible legal discrimination against Westerners (also see Elterman 2008). Some were poorly informed about life in the Philippines, being misled by the optimistic how-to-migrate books. Personality characteristics also are important. Some adaptable expats embrace the new culture, while others may find it too different.  Indeed, survey respondent comments were;  ‘Some love it here and some cannot adjust’, ‘Those who fight the Philippine ways are unhappy here’ and ‘People who come to live in the Philippines either leave after a short time or stay for life in my experience’.
 A key policy implication is that governments should issue migration warnings about particular nations, analogous to tourist travel warnings. These should emphasize the varying success of migrants and the pitfalls. Life in developing nations can be tough. Problems of ageing and decreasing finances with inflation and exchange rate fluctuations and with becoming a minority group member with insecure visa status also need emphasis. One Internet poster spoke of such problems in Thailand; ‘... I have personally seen ... many cases of older foreigners becoming destitute ... especially ... once ... health declines ... Many foreign men die here, alone, penniless, and without any kind of support system from family... The Land of Smiles should also be known as the Land of Unhappy Endings’.  Wild and Gollogly (2014), two physicians practising in Cambodia and Thailand who deal with elderly foreigners, concur. Like the Philippines, these nations have little welfare infrastructure and nursing homes are rare. The family usually cares for the elderly. They state that a foreigner’s friends and even spouse may disappear when health problems set in and money runs low. Many Westerners lose contact with relatives in their home country. Indeed, one survey respondent in the present study noted; ‘My major concern is the lack of old age facilities’. Governments should issue detailed warnings about what to expect in-country and the many pitfalls. Particularly important might be financial risks.  
As noted, nations to which a single Westerner migrates and then marries a local may have special hazards which deserve warnings. Foreigners often cannot own land and may place a house in a partner’s name, later to be evicted. Receiving nations might mitigate this problem by allowing land to be owned by foreigners married to a local or by having better legal provisions to recover assets after divorce.   
Another policy implication is that receiving governments also might look at making permanent residence easier. Many migrants live precariously on successive temporary visas which at any time might not be renewed (Green 2015) and overstay penalties can be severe. 
As noted, researchers have used various theoretical concepts to describe aspects of North-South migration, such as lifestyle, amenity and economic migration. These concepts are useful here. Some respondents really are economic migrants, like many who migrate from South to North. Some seek a better lifestyle. But there are additional patterns. Some had a partner who wanted to return to the Philippines. Some flit between the West and the Philippines. One wealthy respondent moved between residences in Hong Kong and Cebu to recover from the difficulties of life in a developing nation. Some seek a partner. The wish for an attractive partner perhaps unavailable for older and unattractive men in the West is an interesting migration motive.  An eventual general theory of North-South migration must accommodate a variety of motives and patterns. 
	Further research might examine local impacts in detail. A common migration pattern is initial welcome of migrants followed by eventual resentment as numbers and impacts grow. Howard (2009) noted a backlash in Thailand against the Western influx. Lizarraga Morales (2010) found that Americans in Los Cabos, Mexico displaced villagers, took fragile coastal land, built golf courses, strained local water supplies and altered the local economy. Some locals eventually would work only for dollars. 
The author’s subjective impression from in-country observations is that Western migrant impacts in the Philippines overall still are small but may grow. Westerners still are few and are dispersed and usually are not very noticeable on the streets even in tourism districts. Foreigners can own condos but not land, cannot easily get permanent residence, and may be discriminated against in the legal system. They have more wealth than most locals but not enough to trouble the rich local elite. The reproduction of colonial and racial privilege seen in Panama, for example, is not so obvious here. But the author encountered two possible negative impacts. In Cebu City, there were concerns about Westerners inflating condo prices. Angeles City has a large sex industry and many resident Westerners. The author’s very subjective impression was that its atmosphere was quite grim, and the only place where some locals seemed to dislike foreigners. Red light districts can attract low-grade customers and local criminals. Impacts there deserve further study.  
One positive impact may be the improvement in wealth for a Filipino who marries a foreigner. Indeed, impoverished Filipinos can see the latter as like winning the lottery. 
	Another interesting place to study impacts of the Western influx is Dumaguete, a town of about 120,000 on Negros Island.  It has a large, quite obvious Western population. The International Living website in May 2014 quoted a Dumaguete real estate agent (RealPhil) as saying that about one thousand foreigners live in the eastern part of Negros, which mostly would be around Dumaguete. The author spent three days there and commonly saw elderly Westerners with much younger Filipinas. The author’s subjective impression was that the Filipinas seemed happy enough and the pairings apparently provoked no local resentment, but this needs further study. 
	North-South migration needs study in more nations. Cambodia deserves study. It attracts many single male migrants and there are popular books about them (Amat 2011). Cambodia also has an interesting, unstudied phenomenon of some Western migrants now being displaced by a huge influx of mainland Chinese. The latter have moved in great numbers to Sihanoukville. Hotels and casinos are being constructed, rents are skyrocketing, and some Westerners no longer can afford to live there. Cambodia also has an interesting involuntary North-South migration influx which deserves study; ethnic Cambodian deportees from the United States. Often born in refugee camps in Thailand, they went to the United States very young as refugees, were socialized into American culture, but never became citizens. Few speak Khmer and most had little knowledge of Cambodian society.  So far nearly 700 have been deported to Cambodia after committing crimes. 
Further research also might focus more on migration outcomes after some years of residence. What preparations might be made and which migrants are likely to thrive in a given nation? The optimism of how- to- migrate books needs tempering with the realities. 











Footnote 
*There is debate about definitions of such terms as “developed” and “developing” nation and Global North and South and some variation about which nations fall into these categories. Wealthy nations such as Qatar and Bahrain may or may not be considered part of the Global North, for example. Instead, the World Bank now uses four categories of nation; high income (GNI per capita over U.S. $12,235), upper middle income ($3,956 to $12,235), lower middle-income ($1,006 to $3,995) and low income (below $1,006). For the present paper, a “developing” nation is defined as one in any category other than high income. “North-South” migration is defined as from a high income nation to one in any of the other three categories. Migration from only a subset of high income nations is examined here, Western nations, those considered inheritors of “Western civilization” (Quigley 1966; Huntington 1997). These usually are considered to be the United States, Canada, nations in Western and Central Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The peripheral examples of South Africa and Israel were included here. However, the present study had no Israeli respondents and only one South African. Table 1 presents the list of nations considered Western here.
