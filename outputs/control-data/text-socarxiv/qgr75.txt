"7" "Abstract"
"8" "This  present study   investigates  gender discrimination   and its  relationship  with   job satisfaction and mental health  outcomes of Vietnamese workers.  A total of 542 employees in various occupations completed online and offline surveys , including measures on sexist attitudes, job satisfaction, stress in general, and demographic background. Results indicated that gender discrimination is evident among Vietnamese working men and women and it  significantly  predicts  their  job satisfaction and  mental health outcomes. Theoretical and practice implications of the findings were discussed."

"10" "The Relationship Between Gender Discrimination versus Job Satisfaction and Mental Health of Vietnamese W orkers"
"11" "The increasing participation of women in the labor market around the world has provided positive results for both individuals and organizations. However, in practice, gender discrimination has been prevalent in the labor market, specifically in terms of recruitment, wages, and promotion opportunities (Chang et al. ,  2014; Leinonen ,  2012; Reskin ,  1984; Taub ,  1980). Gender  discrimination contributes to a women-unfriendly workplace such as incivility (Cortina ,  2008), bullying (Salin & Hoel ,  2013), prejudice towards female leaders (Eagly & Karau ,  2002), and sexual harassment (Abrams ,  1989). Gender discrimination also has negative impact on mental health (Webster et al. ,  2018) and reduced job satisfaction among women (Shaffer et al. ,  2000).   In  such  context, three   important questions  need to be addressed : how does gender discrimination work? how does it affect people’s life? and how to stop it from happening?  T he purpose of this study is to provide some insight into these questions by using data from Vietnamese working people – a population less studied in previous research in gender discrimination."
"12" "S exism ,  Stereotyping, Prejudice, and  Discrimination"
"13" "Gender discrimination  derives from gender stereotyping  and prejudice. Gender stereotyping is a way of thinking in which individuals are attributed characteristics that are typical of the gender group they belong to. Prejudice is having negative attitude or behaviors that cause harm  or disadvantage to another person  (Allport, 1954) .  Evidence of evolutionary, biological, cognitive, and social conditions can explain for the existence and persistence of gender stereotyping and prejudice (see full text by Ellemers ,  2017 and Fiske ,  2000).  Overall,  gender discrimination refers to the attitudes, expectations, or behaviors that treat a person differently on the basis of their gender."
"14" "In the present study, the terms ‘gender discrimination’, ‘sexism’, and ‘sexist attitude’ are employed interchangeably  with  minimal change in meaning. Although often being used  together  in the literature  here and there ,  we  might be  aware  that sex is a biological categori z ation based primarily on reproductive functioning whereas gender is a social  extension of biological sex (Eckert & McConnell-Ginet, 2003)."
"15" "Hostile and Benevolent Sexism"
"16" "In this study, we examine gender discrimination among Vietnamese workers by taking an intergroup relations perspective on sex and gender (Ashmore, Boca, & Bilder ,  1995). Gender is assumed to be an important social categorization that shapes modern societal structures and the relationship between men and women ( Sherif, 1984 ;  Tajfel, 198 1 ). Well-established gender-related attitude scales reflect the nature, causes, and consequences of  gender-role belief systems within the society (McHugh & Frieze ,  1997). Among those scales, the theory of ambivalent sexism (Glick & Fiske ,  1996) provides a useful account of the multidimensional nature of gender-re lated attitude (McHugh & Frieze,  1997). Attitude object of the ambivalent sexism theory is the interpersonal relationship between men and women, specifically in emergent dyadic units (i.e. married couple, father and daughter). Glick and Fiske (1996, 1997) proposed that sexism manifests itself in hostile and benevolent attitudes towards women, both of which are composed of three shared components: paternalism (dominative and protective), gender differentiation (competitive and complementary), and heterosexuality (intimacy and hostility)."
"17" "Studies published on hostile sexism and prejudice towards women have been  thoroughly examined across research disciplines . Meanwhile, evidence for benevolent sexism can also be  observed across research areas. Women were more likely to receive chivalrous acts (Nadler & Morrow, 1959), elicit help in others (Eagly & Crowley, 1986), and to obtain a loan with lower interest rates than men do (Pham & Talavera ,  2017). Women are generally associated with positive traits that men lack such as niceness, nurturing, communality (Eagly & Mladinic ,  1994). Benevolent sexist attitudes and positive stereotyping and may give good feelings; in fact, it works in tandem with hostile sexism to maintain the traditional gender-role ideologies and male-dominated societal structure ( Glick & Fiske, 2000 ; Nadler & Morrow ,  1959). Indeed, people who are more likely to be hostile towards women are also more likely to incorporate benevolent sexist attitudes and behaviors (Glick & Fiske ,  1996)."
"18" "Gender discrimination in Vietnam"
"19" "Viet Nam has high rates of women’s participation in the labor force and women’s political representation compared to the world average (General Statistics Office ,  2016; International Labor Organization ,  2017; Kenworthy & Malami , 1999). P olitical ly and economically , the role of women in Vietnam’s labor market dated back to the war before 1975, when the government mobilized its people to serve in the army, then the Reform during the 1980s, and lately the transition into the market economy during the 1990s (Goodkind , 1995). Culturally , Vietnam ese society  is influenced by the Confucian philosophy with critical male  superiority  and female subordination, whereby women should  follow   the  Three Obedience s  and the Four Virtues  - “ Tam Tòng, Tứ Đức ”  (Chu ,  2008; Toan Anh ,  1962). In short, Vietnam seems to put  its  \"double standards\" on the shoulders of women with multiple roles: a resourceful wife, a caring mother, a tender daughter in-law, a savvy worker, and socially-adept member of the community (Grosse ,  2015; Schuler et al. ,  2006)."
"20" "A number of empirical studies have reported evidence of gender discrimination in Vietnam. Vietnam ranks 38th, just 5 ranks above Rwanda and 12 ranks above India, out of 57 countries on sexist beliefs (Brandt ,  2011). Social norm holds that it is women’s obligation to protect her husband’s “honor and dignity”, by taking care of household chores so that they can participate in social and economic lives (Nguyen ,  2015).  A  woman’s value is largely determined by her marital status; single women constantly suffer from social pressure s  to get married (Thieu ,  2017). The media reflects and reinforces ​​gender stereotyping in Vietnamese society through the perception and attitude of journalists’ about gender roles when reporting about male and female leaders (Vu et al . ,   2017). In modern Vietnamese society, gender stereotyping, prejudice, and traditional gender role attitudes seem to contribute to gender inequality against women spanning areas from household management, edu cation to employment prospects [ Institution of Social Development Studies  (ISDS), 2015]."
"21" "S tudies in  the field of  social psychology  found  that g ender-related attitudes can generate gender inequality within societies (Bra ndt, 2011; Glick et al., 2000). Nevertheless, research in  workplace gender discrimination in Viet Nam  up to now has tended to  focus on gender inequality in recruitment and compensation rather than gender-rela ted attitudes and perception  (Lam & Laura ,  2017; Plessis, Tran, Marriott & Dodd ,  2015).  Understanding sexist attitudes of a society can shed light on psychological mechanisms of more explicit  forms of gender discrimination , hence improving gender equality of that society.  Therefore, to date, we will  examin e  gender-related attitudes and its relationship with psychological outcomes  in Vietnamese working population."
"22" "Gender  discrimination and job satisfaction"
"23" "Job satisfaction is understood as positive attitudes towa rd an individual’s work when tangible  or intangible rewards fulfill  their  expectations   (Gustainiene & Aukse ,   2009) .  Organizational practice, in which  w omen are compared  to , discriminated against, and  expectedly differently from  men in their work ,  causes women to feel depressed, anxious, and dissatisfied with their job ( Belinsky & Blogg ,  2011 ;  García-Mainar, Garcia-Martín & Montuenga ,  2016 ;  Goldstein ,  2006; Hangan & Kay ,  2 007 ,  & Magee ,  2013). When gender  discrimination creates inequality  at workplace and female workers are not paid   corresponding to  their expectations, they will be dissatisfied with their jobs (Shauman ,  2006 ;  Magee ,  2015).   On the contrary, women will show satisfaction in the workplace  which  h as  a culture with sound values (Miner-Rubino   et al. ,  2009; Ying-Chien, Weng-Chen, & Chien-Hung ,  2011). In terms of training for personal development and promotion, women are not as focused as men, which reduces women’s job satisfaction (Kaiser 2007, Burgard ,  & Görlitz ,  2013)."
"24" "Although much research has been looking at the  outcomes  of  gender  discrimination from others in women’s satisfaction at work place ,  few exists which  examines  the relationship between women’s own sexism and their job satisfaction. One purpose of this study  is  to explore men and women’s sexist beliefs and whether or not such beliefs affect how they feel at work."
"25" "Gender  discrimination and mental health"
"26" "Studies show contradictory results of the difference between the level s  of workplace stress in men and women. Some research suggest that women experience more stress in workplace than men  do   (Bekker, Nijssen, & Hens , 2001; Jick  & Mitz,  1985; Michael et al., 2009)  while others pointed out there are no differences between the two genders  (Martocchio  &  O’Leary, 1989) . However, researchers agree that main stressors and stress-coping mechanism are differed between two genders. For example,  women  may evaluate stress in turbulent events more  intense than  men   (Hall, 1987) .  Gyllensten and Palmer  ( 2005)  also specifically stated that main and unique stressors of female employees include work -life balance, promotion opportunity, and workplace discrimination."
"27" "The three aspects above can be related to Vietnam’s situation. Vietnamese women currently participate in the labour market with a high rate. However, family caregiving is also seen as women’s duty and sometimes it may affect their work  (ISDS , 2015; Williams, 2001) .  Caught between family and working roles, women’s mental health can be negatively impacted  (Cocchiara  &  Bell, 2009) . Studies show that women are more likely to be stress and depressed than men at workplace due to the displacement of family issues and the lack of recognition  (Keene  &  Reynolds, 2005; Lennon, 2006) . Although no studies on the relationship between work-life conflict and stress in Vietnamese  women  has been international ly published, this connection is  observed in other Southeast Asian countries  (Allen et al., 2015; Jamadin et al., 2015) ."
"28" "Career progress and control are  other aspect s  causing high stress level in female employees. Women’s efforts overall are not fully appreciated and are  usually  not reflected appropriately through their career advance  (Powell  &  Butterfield, 2015) . Besides, they experience lower control ability in work than male colleagues  (Krajewski  &  Goffin, 2005) . The issues above can lead to stress because lacking of control forces women to solve workplace issues through emotion-focused rather than problem-focused coping solution ( Folkman et al., 1986) .  The  glass-ceiling effe ct – the barriers that hinders women from advancing their career ladder , can be observed in many Southeast Asian countries  (Lathabhavan  &  Balasubramanian, 2017)   including Vietnam, where only  few   women  work in man a gement position s   (ISDS , 2015) ."
"29" "Women al so usually face discrimination  at workplace. Studies show that Vietnamese wo men have to face discrimination in terms  of wage, ignorance of education level and harassment at workplace  (ISDS , 2015; Lin et al., 2017) . These issues can negatively affect their mental health  (Gyllensten and Palmer, 2005) ."
"30" "The stressors above can be strengthened when women internalize the discriminating values.  Glick et al., (2000, 2004)   found that  conventional gender-related attitudes  and sexist  beliefs  can predict a country’s gender inequality situation.  Female employees with perceptions of sexism experience more stress  especially when the threat is overtly present  (Townsend et al., 2011) .  However, in Vietnam, we have not identified any studies  that  explore this relationship . Here we hypothesize that  there is a relationship between the sexist attitude s  and stress  level  in  Vietnamese women.  The more women  adopt  sexist attitudes, the more they are burdened with gender responsibilities  and dilemmas  which can in turn  cause  distress ."
"31" "T he present study  therefore  sought to examine the following  research questions and hypotheses :"
"32" "RQ1.  Do Vietnamese workers display gender discrimination as seen in other countries?"
"33" "H1.  Vietnamese workers demonstrate  gender discrimination  similar to what have been observed in other countries, supporting the  etic perspective of sexism (that is to view sexism as a universal phenomenon)."
"34" "RQ2. How does gender  discrimination  relate  to the job satisfaction of Vietnamese workers?"
"35" "H2.  There  is a   negative  relationship   between gender discrimination and job satisfaction among Vietnamese  female workers ."
"36" "RQ3.  How does gender  discrimination relate to mental health  outcomes  of Vietnamese workers?"
"37" "H3.  There  is   a  negative  relationship   between gender discrimination and mental health outcomes among Vietnamese  female workers."
"38" "Methods"
"39" "Participants and Procedure"
"40" "A total of five hundred and forty two (N = 542) eligible participants (372 women, 163 men, and 7 others; age range: 18 – 62; M = 28.26; SD = 6.53) took part in this study. Participants work in various occupations and industry sectors. Participants were recruited in three ways durin g September to early November  2018. In the pilot study, twenty six participants, who were full-time working students, completed offline survey at an evening classroom. In the main study, 465 participants completed the online survey which they could access from a location of their choice. These participants were recruited through researchers’ professional and personal networks via Facebook. An electronic link to the online survey was also sent to the Management of the Ho Chi Minh City Export Processing and Industrial Zones Authority (HEPZA), who then forwarded to employees of member companies via email. Twenty seven questionnaires were recorded through this channel. Finally, twenty-eight respondents filled up the questionnaires offline via two researchers’ other family networks.  By collecting respones through these various channels, we sought to  improve external validity of our study, that is the abi lity of our sample to represent  its larger population of interest .  Of the 548 total questionnaires received, six responses which were either null or duplicated were excluded before statistical analyses, resulting in the final sample size of 542."
"41" "All participants were informed that the study involved an online survey examining their mental health outcomes and their general attitudes to men and women and their relationships in the contemporary society. Participants were assured of the anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. Before gathering data for the main study, the research team leader discussed ethical issues with two veteran  researchers  in psychology who are based at Hoa Sen University and Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University. The result of this discussion partly explained why cluster-stratified random sampling was replaced by convenient sampling in an attempt to fully guarantee confidentiality of the respondents. Respondents will receive a phone card voucher of 50,000 VND and a brief report of the study if they wanted to and provided valid contact information."
"42" "Measures"
"43" "The questionnaire developed for this study consisted of well-established scales. The entire questionnaire was translated into Vietnamese and back translated into English to facilitate comparison and verification of accuracy. Questions are organized so that questions about gender attitude and perceived discrimination follow questions on job satisfaction and mental health. This will reduce the likelihood that questions on discrimination will affect the outcome variables. The scales and its corresponding variables are as below:"
"44" "Variable “Gender discriminatory attitudes” is measured by the “Ambivalent Sexism Inventory” (ASI) scale, which consists of 22 statements about men, women and their relationships in the contemporary society and divided into 2 sub-scales, namely (a) Hostile Sexism, e.g. “Women exaggerate problems at work.”  and (b) Benevolent Sexism. E.g. “Women should be cherished and protected by men.” Answers are structured around a 6 point Likert scale,  that ranged from 0 = Disagree  strongly to 5 = Agree strongly. This is a common gender attitude scale, with measurable indicators that can be applied across cultures (Glick & Fiske ,  1996; Glick et al. ,  2000; McHugh & Frieze ,  1997)."
"45" "The variable job satisfaction is measured by 36 questions of the “Job Satisfaction Survey” questionnaire adapted from Spector (1994), translated by Nguyen Phi Tan (2011), which included feelings about the job, such as “I like the people I work with.” The answers are structured around the 6-point Likert scale, ranging from level 1 = Disagree very much to level 6 = Agree very much. The Alpha Cronbach coefficient is 0.91. The sub-scales have an internal stability coefficient of 0.60 to 0.78 (Spector 1997)."
"46" "The variable Mental health is measured by the “Stress in General revised” scale (Stanton et al. 2001; Yankelevich et al. 2012). This scale measures the specific stress levels in the workplace, using eight phrases that express different characteristics of stress and require choosing one of three possible levels of “Yes”, “No”, and “Not sure”. The “Stress in General revised” scale was tested on a large sample and showed high efficacy (Stanton et al. 2001)."
"47" "Demographic variables include gender, age, marital status, education, income and experience levels."
"48" "Data processing and analysis"
"49" "Data were analyzed usi ng R-Studio version 1.1.456 – an  open-source statistical environment. To examin e the first research question, we  ran confirmatory factor analysis, determined reliability coefficients, t- statistics , correlation coefficients, effect sizes and p-values. To test the second and third hypotheses, I ran correlation analyses on the predictor  variables of  overall sexism and its sub-factors , and on the outcome variables of job satisfaction and mental health measures."
"50" "To control the effect of demographic variables (gender, age, education level, and occupation) on the outcome variables, I entered these variables into the multivariate linear regression, along with the predictor variables and outcome variables of each hypothesis."

"101" "Confirmatory Factor Analysis"
"102" "The advantage of using confirmatory factor analysis procedures with R’s lavaan package are threefold: (a) it allows the theoretical model of ASI to be cross-culturally tested with the present study’s data from a Vietnamese p opulation (Hurley et al., 1997);  (b) models can be examined and compared through assessment of their comparative goodness of fit (CFI) to the observed data (Ho oper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008);  and (c) models can include second-order factors (Rosseel, 2012). We examined the  Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)   developed by  Glick and Fiske (1996) in which HS and BS are separated but  interrelated components nested under the total ambivalent  sexism and that BS has three sub-factors:  protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and sexual intimacy."
"103" "We first conducted a pilot study ( N  = 26) to get preliminary feedback on the procedure and scale items (Kelley, Clark, & Sitzia ,  2003). As a result, we found that response rate was marginal when the formal top-down approach was used (in which the employer or top executive was asked to distribute the survey link to their employees). In addition, there was feedback about unfamiliar concepts (e.g. feminism/ feminist) and translations that caused confusing interpretations (e.g.  ‘ There are actually very few women who get a kick out of teasing men by seemingly sexually available and then refusing male advances .’ ). Low response rate observed in the pilot stage was the second reason why cluster-stratified random sampling was replaced by  snowball convenient sampling in the main study (Edwards et al. 2002). As for the second feedback, we   decided to keep the original questionnaire, adding a simple definition for ‘feminism’ underneath the item  and test the model in the main study with a larger sample."
"104" "Factor Structure and Model Fit of the ASI Scale.  We use Comparative Fit Index (CFI: Bentler, 1990) and the absolute fit index Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA:  Steiger, 1990) to access the fit of the data to models. We tested each of these models: a one- factor model (all items representing a single sexism factor); a two-factor model (each item to load on either a HS or a BS factor); a full model (two factors HS and BS, with BS contains three sub-factors: Paternalism, Comparative Differentiation, and Sexuality). The final model is a modified model which contains of 19 items, with two three items from the hostile sexism being removed from the original scale because of their low factor loading (< 0.4) (Table 3)  (Nunnally,  1979). These items were also the ones that received comments about its wording from respondents in the pilot stage."

"176" "Properties of the Raw Score ASI Scales"
"177" "Reliability . Reliability analyses of a total ASI score (average of all items) and average scores for the two major subscales of the ASI yielded good omega coefficients (Zinbarg, Revelle, Yovel, & Li 2005). The reliability (ω) of the total sexism (19 items) is .79, Hostile Sexism is .82, and Benevolent Sexism is .73. The lower omega coefficient of BS, which is consistent with previous studies, is predictable given the multidimensional nature of this subscale (Fiske & Glick 1996)."
"178" "Sex Differences in Mean Scores . For the theoretical model of ASI to be valid, we expect mean differences between men and women on the ASI scale. Indeed, men ( M  = 3.81,  SD  = 0.55) displayed more sexism overall than women ( M  = 3.57,  SD  = 0.59),  t(323)  = -4.41,  p  < .0001. Men ( M  = 3.78,  SD  = 0.77) were also more likely to adopt sexist attitudes that are hostile towards women than women did ( M  = 3.45,  SD  = 0.76),  t(302)  = -4.56,  p  < .01. Although to a smaller magnitude, there was also significant difference in the BS score between men ( M  =3.83,  SD  = 0.71) and women ( M  = 3.69,  SD  = 0.74),  t(322)  = -2.12,  p  = .03."

"309" "Discussion"
"310" "The present study examined (1)  whether there is gender discrimination and  (2)  whether  gender discrimination  negatively  predicts job satisfaction and  positively predicts  mental health outcomes among  working Vietnamese."
"311" "Confirmation factory analysis provided the evidence that  Vietnamese workers demonstrate both hostile sexism and benevolent sexism which are separate but related with each other , supporting the first hypothesis . The best fit of the modified ASI model, as compared with alternative models, suggests that (a) HS and BS are separates aspects of sexism (as evident by comparing with the one-factor model); (b) BS has separate sub-factors (as evident by comparing with the two-factor model); and (c) ASI model in Vietnam sample is best  fit   without the items with feminism/feminists and one item with potentially confusing translation that load weakly on HS factor (as evident by comparing with the full ASI model).  These findings add to the growing evidence of the widespread existence  and continuity  of sexism in general and the  specific  HS and BS as coherent sexist ideologies in a non-Western culture  ( Heilman & Eagly 2008 ; Glick et al., 2000 )."
"312" "Furthermore, Vietnamese men  also  revealed higher degrees of sexist beliefs as compared to women in both total ASI and its two subscales.  This result confirms the conceptual idea of discrimination and prejudice where the  members of the  superior groups  tend to  d iscriminate   against the  those of the  lower-status groups due to inflexible and faulty generalization   (Allport, 1954 ;  Tajfel, 1981 ).  Consistent with previous findings where men are not different from women  in their BS scores, our study found a significant but  small  gap in BS between the two genders.   This result indicates that w omen are more likely to adopt benevolent sexist ideologies  (to the extent that  their BS  is almost equal with men’s ) and to reject sexist attitudes that are hostile towards them  ( so that their HS score is  significantly smaller than men’s)."
"313" "At social level , sexism  traditionally  emphasizes two components: hostility towards women (i.e. antipathy and negative stereotypes) and the endorsement of traditional gender roles (i.e. actively constraining women to roles of less status and power than those of men and assigning women to performing socially-prescribed behaviours). The construct of benevolent sexism was first articulated and empirically tested by Fiske and Glick (1996, 1997) and later cross-culturally validated by Glick et al. (2000). Benevolent sexism denotes subjectively favourable, chivalrous ideology characterizing women as pure and warm creatures who need to be protected, supported, adored, and whose intimacy is what men need to complete themselves. Although benevolent sexism may sound counter-intuitive, it coexists and complements hostile sexism in socialising and perpetuating the patriarchal societies in which men are superiors and women are subordinates. Indeed, Glick et al. (2000) found that national mean scores on  both  HS and BS predict gender inequality across nations."
"314" "At organizational level, BS can work to place female employees at certain disadvantage s . Stereotypically, women are generally regarded with high warmth and low competence (Cuddy,  Glick, & Xu ,  2002) and occupancy of homemaker and  lower status roles (Eagly, Wood, & Diekman ,  2000). It might be possible for men to be loved and successful at the same time;  however, the same equation does not necessarily hold true for women. Professional mothers, previously highly evaluated, can be perceived with higher warmth but less competence after  returnin g from maternal leaves (Cuddy,  Fiske , & Glick,  2004). Career-oriented women or female   leaders, who violate the gender role prescriptions, may elicit hostile sexist attitudes; on the contrary, women who embrace conventional roles earn themselves the benevolent types  of treatment  (Eagly & Karau 2002). This situation presents difficulties and dilemmas for women at work and hinders opportunities for equal pay, promotion and career advance."
"315" "Consistent with Glick and Fiske study’s findings (1996), the positive relationship  between HS and BS scales for the entire sample in this study supports the ambivalent theory’s claim that these two aspects of se xism are related sexist ideologies  (Nadler & Morrow, 1959). Furthermore, we also found that HS and BS were positively correlated only for women but not for men (c.f. Fiske & Glick, 1996: The authors found the HS-BS correlations among male student samples but not male nonstudent samples). An implication of the non-significant HS-BS correlation in male respondents might be that men are more purely either hostile or benevolent rather than ambivalent towards women, whereas women’s adoption of sexist ideologies reflects their inclination to either accept or reject prevalent social norms. For men, the individual difference in sexist tendencies may be underpinned by motivational affect and  the  accumulated experience they have with women  over time . An individual man may be either a sexist in general – such that he adopts  both  HS and BS as complementary traits,  either  a purely hostile sexist, or a purely benevolent sexist. In contrast, women may employ benevolent  ideology   themselves as a self-defense mechanism against hostile sexism towards them  (Glick & Fiske, 2001) . Whereas HS serves to punish women who violate their socially-prescribed gender roles and stereotypes, BS offers the rewards to those who conform (Jackman 1994; Glick et al. 1997)."
"316" "Thus, in a sexist world, a possible remedy for women is to embrace benevolent beliefs – the sexist ideolog y  which promises that men’s power will be of women’s advantage, apparently only if she is successful to secure a marriage with a capable male provider and protector.  Indeed,  across cultures,  social norms hold that a woman’s value is largely determined  by her marital status (Friedan, 1963; Dang ,  2012; Thieu ,  2017).  T he putative power of BS makes this form of sexism, despite being ostensibly subtle, are  critical  in precipitating gender inequality."
"317" "Relationship of  Sexism  and Job Satisfaction"
"318" "In this study, we found that both hostile and benevolent sexism can predict certain aspects of job satisfaction for both working men and women, supporting the second hypothesis. The relationship between gender discrimination and job satisfaction has been reported in previous studies (Antecol, Barcus, & Cobb-Clark, 2009; Shaffer et al., 2000). Given that job satisfaction is associated with increased absenteeism (Bockerman & Ilmakunnas, 2006), lower productivity ( Mangione & Quinn 1975 ), and higher rate of mental health problems ( see Faragher, Cass, & Cooper, 2007 for an overview ), the results of this study can help design effective interventions to improve job satisfaction at work from the gender perspective."
"319" "For women,  the adoption of sexist attitudes and conventional gender norms may prevent one from reaching out for promotion opportunities because of the guilty-ridden feelings and social pressures that working women may constantly carry  (Grandey,  Cordeido, & Crouter, 2005) . This can be related to  Vietnam where ‘double-standard’ criteria for women have been  actively  endorsed.  Studies found that women continue to experience obstacles that reduce opportunities and abilities to achieve leadership positions in organizations due to gender stereotyping  (Duehr, & Bono, 2006;  Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, & Ristikari, 2011; Rudman, 1998 ),  glass-ceiling effect (Barreto, Ryan, & Schmitt, 2009) .  Even though if women are in leadership positions, they may face more difficulties than their male counterparts (Bruckmuller, Ryan, Rink, & Haslam, 2014).  The fact that more women are in top positions may not help as much as we may expect. This can be explained by the  queen-bee phenomenon  where top female leaders  implicitly discriminate against junior female employees  (Faniko, Ellemers, Derks, & Cioldi, 2017)."
"320" "Such  sexist attitude’s  effect on job satisfaction is not limited to women only. Men are socially prescribed to work in masculine occupations and act as the ‘bread-winner’ who are responsible financially for the household. Developmentally, young children are gender socialised to embrace gender identity and social categorization on the basis of sex. Interestingly, in a study of male populations of engineers (a traditional occupation) and a school counsellor (a non-traditional occupation), gender role attitudes did not inform career decisions but significantly predicted job satisfaction (Dodson & Borders, 2006)."
"321" "Relationship of Sexism and Mental Health Outcomes"
"322" "This  study indicates that having sexist attitudes,  either  in benevolent  or  hostile manner, can predict  certain aspects of  workplace stress. More  importantly , the relationship  is observed  in  both genders , showing that the effects of sexism on stress  at  workplace do not limit  only   to  female workers.  Our study  focuses on ambivalent sexism and workplace stress from the perspective of the attitude holder. The results  are interesting given that  p revious research has  mainly established  the link  between  women’s experiences of hostile and benevolent sexism  and   physical and psychological health  ( Dumont, Sarlet, & Dardene, 2010 ;  Goldenhar, Swanson, Hurrell, Ruder, & Deddens, 1998;  Hurst & Beesley, 2012;  Salomon, Burgess, & Bosson, 2017 ;  Townsend, Major, Gangi, & Mendes, 2011 ) ."
"323" "Our findings suggest s  that BS is specifically linked with feeling overwhelmed at work.  Benevolent sexist women internalize social prescriptions that women should be lovable, warm, and supportive of their male partner’s career rather than  p u rsuing  their own  professional path  ( Hammond & Overall, 2017 ).  For those who are at work, b enevolent sexist women who embrace  traditional gender roles  are more likely to  attribute conflict in their intimate relationships to their workplace  achievement  (Exposito, Herrera, Moya, & Glick, 2010).  Besides, w omen who hold many benevolent sexist beliefs place their body esteem on feminine and youthful physical appearance and make effort to enhance such features (Franzoi, 2001). Ironically, people with immature facial features are more likely to be perceived as weak, dependent, and less capable for high-status jobs than people with more mature appearances (Zebrowitz, Tenenbaum, & Goldstein, 1991).  Thus, b oth benevolent sexist beliefs and youthful physical features   might be  potential risk factors for  women’s  emotional distress at workplace."
"324" "Another important finding of this study is that sexist attitude is associated with mental health outcomes of the attitude holder, regardless of their gender. As men show significantly more sexism than women do, we would discuss several possible explanations for the association of sexist beliefs and stress level in men. M ale employees  who endorse patriarchal ideologies  can be overwh elmed by the  expectation of being  the  family’s  main earner  or being in male-appropriate jobs (Clow, Ricciardelli, & Bartfay, 2014;  ISDS , 2015) .  Hostile sexist men may find the world where women are becoming more economically independent more stressful and resort to risky and destructive behaviours (Stanistreet, Swami, Pope, Bambra, & Scott-Samuel, 2007). Men with greater sexist attitudes towards women were found to have greater desire for a more muscular physique and this may affect their mental and body’s health (Stanistreet, Bambra, & Scott-Samuel, 2005; Swami & Voracek, 2013)."
"325" "Practical I mplication s"
"326" "This study’s findings on gender discrimination in Vietnam have practical implications for policy recommendations and application in organizational practice."
"327" "At the individual level, we need to recognize the nature and existence of gender stereotypes and discrimination in ourselves and in the society. Employees themselves and employers should be aware that gender stereotypes are socially and environmentally influenced, although not directly stated, at all times, and often in an indirect manner that we cannot perceive (Ellemers ,  2017). Therefore, we cannot rely on superficial efforts to justify the implementation of gender equality and non-discrimination. In fact, government regulation on gender representation in the workplace can be counterproductive, creating an aversion to female colleagues in men and tacit competition among women themselves for limited job placement and meager growth opportunities (Kaiser et al. ,  2013; Taub ,  1980).  We  therefore recommend that government and institutional policies focus on ways to improve individual knowledge and understanding of gender-based discrimination   via community education and awareness programs ( Schwartz & Lindley, 2009). Indeed, the effectiveness of raising people’s awareness of the most subtle forms of sexism has been nicely demonstrated in an exper imental study by Becker and Swim  (2011).  T his is the  stepping stone to   the  eliminat ion of  more direct forms of discrimination in recruitment, wages, and other  conditions  in the workplace."
"328" "From an organizational perspective, businesses should assist male and female workers in harmonizing expectations about gender roles in job and family responsibilities. Experiencing role conflict at home and at work is a stressor among women (Gyllensten & Palmer ,  2005). They may lose opportunities for promotion, professional training and even their job because of their gender-stereotypical roles such as childbirth, caring for the elderly and sick members in the family. Therefore, giving men equal conditions as a women in family roles such as longer paid leave and flexible working time during their wives’ pregnancy and nursing  children will help balance and adjust expectations about gender-stereotypical roles. In addition, businesses should also collaborate with gender specialists and researchers to organize training courses to help employees raise awareness about gender stereotypes and gender-based discrimination. This is the first step in building a healthy and professional working environment."
"329" "From a legal point of view, the law and relevant by-laws on anti-discrimination and gender equality should contain specific provisions on sanctions and penalties for violations, rather than merely rules and incentives (Gender Equality  Lawsuit,  2007). In addition, public authorities and businesses should reduce the burden of presenting the evidence that the violation occurred on the part of the discriminated person (Ellemers ,  2017). This will help us lessen dependent on the ability to identify when there is unfair treatment and the victim’s wish to make a complaint or denunciation."
"330" "Overall,  o ur study  contributes  one of the first evidence of the relationship between sexist attitudes and  psychological outcomes at the workplace in  Vietnam. The result shows that the adopted view of gender role  can  predict workplace stress which  affect s  organizations’   working efficiency. Hence, in order to reduce stress in employees, especially stress caused by gender-discriminated perspectives, company should raise the awareness of sexism through trainings, providing information or introducing policies promoting gender equality. Given that this tendency exists in both gender, not only female but male employees will also benefit from these improvements."
"331" "Limitations  and Future Directions"
"332" "This study has  several limitations. First,  we did not include the LGBT gender group in our analysis because there is not sufficient number of respondents to run statistical tests.  Further  study using LGBT data is needed.  Second,  given the scope of  this   study,  there are  other  factors  in between the relationship of sexism and mental outcomes  might not being  investigated  here  (i.e. industry, type of job) ,  which  might  explain why the effect sizes (i.e. regression and correlation coefficients) tend to be small.  Therefore, future studies should  elaborate on this topic , especially on the mechanisms of how sexism affect s  workplace stress .  Identification of these pathways will increase the effectiveness of the interventions through finding and addressing the moderating factors of the relationship between sexist attitude and mental health.  Third, we did not include a measure of implicit gender attitudes which might have shed light on aspects unrevealed in traditional survey method.  More sophisticated experimental design and  implicit measures of sexism  is warranted and a promising direction of gender research in Vietnam."
"333" "Conclusion"
"334" "In summary, the findings of this study  is a  preliminary step in understanding workplace gender   discrimination in Vietnam, its mechanism and impacts on psychological factors among workers. This knowledge not only contributes to broadening the theoretical basis  of gender issues  in general, but also provides evidence-based recommendations to support state and corporate efforts  in  achiev ing  sustainable development  fifth goal  on eliminating gender inequality."
