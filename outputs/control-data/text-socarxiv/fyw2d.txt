Abstract
This investigation aggregates intact or reconstructed Gahagan bifaces from the
southern Caddo area and central Texas to test the hypothesis that Gahagan
biface morphology differs between the regions. The Gahagan bifaces (n = 102)
were scanned, then analysed using a novel landmarking protocol and the tools
of geometric morphometrics. Results provide a preview of the significant differences in Gahagan biface morphology expressed between the southern Caddo
area and central Texas regions. The size discrepancy represents an inversion
of current theoretical constructs that posit a decrease in tool size thought to
articulate with an increase in distance from the raw material source. It is
posited that the contrasting morphologies represent two discrete communities
of practise; one (emergent Caddo horticulturalists) where Gahagan bifaces were
enlisted primarily for burial and ritualistic activities, and the other (central
Texas hunter-gatherers) where Gahagan bifaces were utilised over a longer time
span in more practical and utilitarian contexts.

The mathematical definition of a “form” has a quality of precision
which was quite lacking in our earlier stage of mere description;
it is expressed in few words, or in still briefer symbols, and these
5

words or symbols are so pregnant with meaning that thought itself
is economised (Thompson, 1917, 720-721).
This contribution follows a recent study of Gahagan biface morphology that
enlisted the three largest samples in the southern Caddo area from the Gahagan Mound (16RR1), George C. Davis (41CE19), and Mounds Plantation

10

(16CD12) sites (Figure 1) (Selden Jr. et al., 2018). The results of that study
indicated a significant difference in shape between Gahagan bifaces found at
the Mounds Plantation site compared with those found at the Gahagan Mound
and George C. Davis sites (Selden Jr. et al., 2018, Figure 7). The test for
morphological disparity indicated that the sample from Gahagan Mound occu-

15

pied a significantly greater range of morphospace than the sample from Mounds
Plantation, providing limited evidence for discussions of specialisation and diversity. Morphological integration was also significant, meaning those traits
used to characterise Gahagan biface shape (blade and base) were found to vary
in a coordinated manner. These results confirmed the supposition advanced

20

by Shafer (1973) that the assemblage of Gahagan bifaces from the George C.
Davis site compares favourably with those reported from the Gahagan Mound
site (Moore, 1912; Webb and Dodd Jr., 1939).
The shape difference identified in the previous study occurs across the same
geography as a difference in Smithport Plain and Hickory Engraved (Caddo)

25

bottle shapes (Selden Jr., 2018a,b, 2019a,b). The difference in Caddo bottle
morphology has been attributed to two Formative/Early Caddo communities
of practise—one north, and the other south—where the same decorative motifs
were applied to two distinct bottle shapes. The shape boundary found to occur
in Smithport Plain and Hickory Engraved bottles (Selden Jr., 2019b, Figure 1)

also manifests in Gahagan bifaces where the difference in shape was expressed
spatially between the Gahagan Mound and Mounds Plantation sites (Selden Jr.
et al., 2018).
The Gahagan type was suggested by Clarence H. Webb at the Caddo Conference in 1970 (Shafer, 1973), and was intended as a replacement for those

35

specimens that Newell and Krieger (1949) considered Copena knives based upon
what they saw as similarities in form, but not technology, between bifaces found
at the George C. Davis site in east Texas and those reported by Webb and DeJarnette (1942) in Alabama. Gahagan bifaces were named for the finely-crafted
bifaces discovered by Moore (1912) at the Gahagan Mound site. Shafer (1973)

40

later argued that Gahagan and Copena bifaces differ in both morphology and

3

technology, but did not include a discussion of technological differences in his
analysis of Gahagan bifaces from the George C. Davis site. Shafer (2006, 22)
would later advance a formal description for the type; however, a discussion
of those technological attributes needed to discriminate Gahagan from Copena
45

bifaces was not included.
Additional specimens were added from known Caddo sites (Doc Marks and
Pelican), and the whole of the sample from the southern Caddo area is contrasted with those recovered from central Texas sites (Bastrop State Park and
the Doerge Collection), including one unprovenienced collection from the Brazos

50

Valley Museum of Natural History (BVMNH) (Figures 1 and 2). The Doerge
Collection is a large private collection donated to the BVMNH, and includes
the largest collection of Gahagan bifaces found outside of the southern Caddo
area (Shafer, 2006, Table 5) (Figure 2, a9-s9). No site-specific details were
provided to the museum related to context, association, or cultural affiliation;

55

however, the museum was informed that the whole of the collection was from
Brazos County, Texas. Another small collection of Gahagan bifaces are curated
at BVMNH (Figure 2, a8-h8), are unprovenienced, and assumed to come from
the central Texas region. The single specimen from Bastrop State Park (Figure
2, a6) was found on the surface at the Rylander site (41BP882) by Emmy Lyn

60

Francell, and is curated at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. There
are no chronometric dates associated with any of the central Texas archaeological contexts used in this study; however, Gahagan bifaces have been recovered
from dated contexts at the J. B. White (41MM341) (Gadus et al., 2006) and
Baker (41SS192) sites (Hixson and Whitley, 2020), which are included in the

65

chronological models produced for this study.
Preliminary visual observations point to significant morphological differences
between Gahagan bifaces recovered from Caddo and central Texas sites. Gahagan bifaces are a morphological type that are regularly interpreted to be
diagnostic of Formative and/or Early Caddo occupations (Shafer, 2006, 1973).

Context
The flexuous blade shapes associated with Gahagan bifaces from Burial 1
75

at the Gahagan Mound site led to the initial interpretation that they were
knives (Moore, 1912, Figures 18-21). A subsequent investigation at the Gahagan
Mound site (Webb and Dodd Jr., 1939) classified the bifaces into two different
biface types (both currently designated as Gahagan bifaces); one made of dull
gray chert with a square base and a symmetrical or curved knife form, and the

80

other made of semi-translucent flint with a curved base and more strongly curved
sides. In Burial Pit 2 at Gahagan Mound (Webb and Dodd Jr., 1939, Plate 21),
one Gahagan biface (Figure 2, a2) (Webb and Dodd Jr., 1939, Plate 27, No.
1, 3) was found near the left shoulder of an adult male (Skeleton 3), but most
artefacts were recovered near the northwest margin of the burial pit, including

85

the remaining Gahagan bifaces associated with that context. In Burial Pit 3 at
Gahagan Mound (Webb and Dodd Jr., 1939, Plate 23, 1), one Gahagan biface
was found near the left femur of Skeleton 1 (Figure 2, r2) (Webb and Dodd Jr.,
1939, Plate 27, No. 1, 2). Similar to Burial Pit 2, most of the artefacts from
Burial Pit 3 were found along the northwest margin, including the remainder of

90

Gahagan bifaces from that context (Webb and Dodd Jr., 1939).
At the George C. Davis site, two Gahagan bifaces were found outside of
mound or feature contexts (Figure 2, a3 and b3), and their feature assignments
(6L3 and 21R14) articulate with the excavation grid used by Newell and Krieger
(1949). Feature 3 is associated with a 27-foot diameter ring of 35 postholes lo-

95

cated east of Mound A (Newell and Krieger, 1949, Figure 4), where one Gahagan
biface (Figure 2, c3) was found in the outlining postholes (Newell and Krieger,
1949).
Feature 134 is associated with a Stage I burial feature at the George C. Davis
site that predates the construction of Mound C, and contained eight individuals

100

(Story, 1997, 1972). One large (48 cm), well-thinned biface that Story (1997, 22)
listed as a “Gahagan?” biface was found near the right leg of Skeleton 5. Shafer
6

(1973, Figure 19x) included this specimen—and one additional large specimen
from Feature 119 (Shafer, 1973, Figure 19w)—in his Group 2 bifaces due to
a lack of fine pressure-flaked margins definitive of Group 1 (Gahagan) bifaces.
105

Nine Gahagan bifaces from Feature 134 were recovered from Concentration 2;
seven (Figure 2, p3-r3, u3, v3, x3, and aa3) were found “about and under gray
pigment,” and two others were found outside of the pigmented area (Figure 2,
s3, w3) (Story, 1997, 21-23 and Figure 12). Organic residue can still be found
on a selection of these Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr. et al., 2018, Figure 2), which

110

Shafer (1973, 228) notes, “may be the remains of leather or bark sheaths or cane
wrapping.” Three additional Gahagan bifaces (Figure 2, t3, y3, and z3) were
found in Concentration 3 (Story, 1997, 21-22 and Figure 12).
Feature 119 (Story, 1997, Figure 13-18) articulates with a Stage II burial
feature at the George C. Davis site that can be traced from the surface of the

115

second mound stage, and included offerings associated with two discrete layers
(Story, 1997, 1972, 1969). The first layer offerings include Gahagan bifaces from
Concentration 1 (Figure 2, o3), Concentration 2 (Figure 2, e3, g3, h3, and n3),
and Concentration 3 (Figure 2, f3, i3, j3, and l3). Second layer offerings include
Gahagan bifaces associated with Concentration 1 (Figure 2, d3), Concentration

120

3 (Figure 2, m3), and Skeleton 1 (Figure 2, k3).
Burial Pit 2 at Mounds Plantation is the only context that contained a single
individual, and Webb and McKinney (1975, 97) noted (of the Gahagan bifaces)
that “fine edge retouch leaves the edges with almost no serration or irregularity,
altogether the finest flint knapping that we have seen from a Caddoan site”

125

(Figure 2, b4-i4). The bifaces from Burial Pit 2 at Mounds Plantation were
found in a bundle, but those from Burial Pit 5 articulate with the males of
Groups 1 and 2 (Figure 2, j4 and k4, respectively), and were found in a context
parallel to the left forearm, pointed toward the hand (Webb and McKinney,
1975, Figure 5). The biface from Burial Pit 8 at Mounds Plantation (Figure

130

2, l4) was found in the same position on the left forearm; however, the largest
biface (Burial Pit 1, Skeleton 1; see Figure 2, a4) was found across the chest of
that individual (Webb and McKinney, 1975).
7

McKinney posited that Gahagan bifaces may have been carried in a sheath
attached to the left forearm (Webb and McKinney, 1975). Similarly, Shafer
135

(1973) noted that—at the George C. Davis site—edge modification was confined
to traces of polish and smoothing along the widest blade segments and near the
tip on burial specimens, was more pronounced on specimens from non-mound
contexts, and possibly represented sheath wear. The polish that Shafer (1973)
discussed supports McKinney’s hypothesis (Webb and McKinney, 1975), where

140

the tip and lateral edges of the bifaces may have become polished while being
worn in a sheath on the left forearm with the tip pointed toward the wrist.
Chronometric dating
Emerson and Girard (2004, Table 1) reported three AMS radiocarbon dates
from Burial Pit 2 at the Gahagan Mound site. The first (UGA12296), from

145

Deposit 3 in Burial Pit 2, was fragmented wood—possibly cypress—from a
copper-covered wooden object that Webb and Dodd Jr. (1939, 99, Plate 29, No.
2, Object 5) describe as a pendant in the shape of an animal claw (Emerson
and Girard, 2004). The second (ISGS A0465), found adjacent to the head of
Skeleton 3 (adult female) in Burial Pit 2, was unidentifiable fragmented wood

150

that Webb and Dodd Jr. (1939, 96, Plate 21 and 28, Nos. 2-3) describe as square
ear ornaments of copper-coated cypress wood (Emerson and Girard, 2004). The
third (ISGS A0466), from Deposit 2 in Burial Pit 2, was not described by Webb
and Dodd Jr. (1939, 96), but Emerson and Girard (2004, 62) describe it as a
leather-covered copper object.

155

Story and Valastro Jr. (1977, Table 1) reported two radiocarbon dates (Tx913 and Tx-1206) from contexts associated with the special mortuary in Mound
C at the George C. Davis site where Gahagan bifaces were found (Story and
Valastro Jr., 1977, Table 5). The date from Feature 119 (Tx-913) is associated
with the green fill placed atop Caddo remains in the Stage II burial in Mound C

160

(Story and Valastro Jr., 1977). The date from Feature 134 (Tx-1206) provided
an age that Story and Valastro Jr. (1977) believed to be inconsistent with the
stratigraphic position of the sample, thus it is excluded from the chronological
8

model. Neither of the legacy dates from the George C. Davis site account for
isotopic fractionation.
165

Webb and McKinney (1975, 72) reported three dates from two logs found
in Burial Pit 5 at the Mounds Plantation site. Two of those (Tx-55 and M1446), both from Log 1, were described by Webb and McKinney (1975, 72) as
coming “from the upper set of timbers, about 50 cm above the pit floor.” The
third (Tx-56), from Log 6, was described by Webb and McKinney (1975, 72) as

170

coming from “Log 6. . . nearer the center of the pit and just above the pit floor.”
None of these three legacy dates account for isotopic fractionation. Webb and
McKinney (1975) omit the Log 6 (Tx-56) date from further discussions of the
site, thus it is omitted from the chronological model. None of the legacy dates
from the Mounds Plantation site account for isotopic fractionation.

175

There are no strong associations at the J. B. White site (41MM341) between
biface type and analysis unit, mostly because the sample is so small. Of those
bifaces and biface fragments recovered, shape could only be determined for 11
specimens. Three have the classic Gahagan shape, and four express morphological attributes characteristic of Friday bifaces. Both occur in Analytical Units

180

(AU) 1 and 2, and a date of CE 895 was proposed as the start of AU2, but
that possibly extends to CE 780. Neither biface type was encountered in AU3
(Gadus et al., 2006, 139). Dates within the report were not modeled, leading
to difficulties in determining the temporal boundaries of AU1 and AU2 (Gadus
et al., 2006, 136).

185

The Gahagan biface recovered from the Baker site (41SS192) was part of
what Hixson and Whitley (2020) identified as the pre-Toyah component. This
component is limited to small (0.5 m) charcoal-stained sub-circular areas in
Block 2 of the excavation that included burned rocks and bone fragments (Hixson and Whitley, 2020). The Gahagan biface was found in a shovel test along

190

the terrace edge in association with similar arrow points found in Block 2 (Hixson and Whitley, 2020). Thus, the authors argue that while the date does not
articulate directly with the same context as the biface, it should be considered
part of the same component. Cultural materials from this area of the site were
9

nearly as dense as that found in Block 2 (Hixson and Whitley, 2020). Given the
195

loose association of Gahagan bifaces with the dated contexts at the Baker site,
two chronological models are presented. One includes the Baker site dates, and
the other does not.
Chronometric dates from those contexts listed above were included in the
chronological model for Caddo contexts where Gahagan bifaces have been found;

200

one with the Baker site dates (Figure 3, top), and the other without (Figure
3, bottom). The oxcAAR library (https://github.com/ISAAKiel/oxcAAR) was
used to build the chronological model in R, which was executed using OxCal
4.3.2 (Ramsey, 1995, 2017) and the IntCal13 calibration curve (Reimer et al.,
2013). The chronological model demonstrates the modeled probability distribu-

205

tions at the beginning and end of the southern Caddo area and central Texas
phases (Selden Jr., 2020). Additional details associated with the chronological
model can be found in the supplemental materials (Selden Jr., 2020). Results
illustrate that the starting and ending probability distributions for the southern
Caddo area exhibit temporal overlap with the start of the central Texas tradi-

210

tion; although, the Caddo were potentially using this biface type earlier than
their central Texas counterparts, who employed the type for a longer span in
both models (Selden Jr., 2020).
Manufacture
Shafer (1973) discerned that all raw materials used in the manufacture of

215

Gahagan bifaces found at the George C. Davis site were from non-local sources,
which was a noteworthy revision to the initial interpretation by Newell and
Krieger (1949), in which the raw materials were considered to be of local origin. Further support for Shafer’s assertion is added in his discussion of the
fragility of specimens coupled with the absence of failures in the extensive exca-

220

vations at George C. Davis (Shafer, 1973). This observation was expanded with
findings from other locations (Banks and Winters, 1975), where investigators
believed Gahagan bifaces to have been manufactured with Woodford, Battiest,
and Ogallala cherts, as well as cherts from the Kiamichi Mountains. Shafer

(1973) also noted the size and shape of Gahagan bifaces from the Davis site to
225

be more uniform in Feature 134 compared with those from Feature 119, and
that differences in the size of Gahagan bifaces from non-burial contexts were
more striking than differences in shape. Shafer (1973) provides evidence for the
presence of use-wear and fracture patterns on specimens from non-mound con-

11

texts at George C. Davis, suggesting that Gahagan bifaces from Caddo contexts
230

may have functioned similarly to those used by hunter-gatherer groups. In the
analysis of debitage from George C. Davis, Shafer (1973) argued that limited
biface manufacture occurred at the site, but none of that debitage is directly
attributable to Gahagan biface manufacture.
In addition to those Gahagan bifaces found at mound sites in the southern

235

Caddo area, there is abundant evidence that similar bifaces were manufactured
by contemporary hunter-gatherer groups in central and east-central Texas. Sites
with evidence of manufacture and use can be found across a series of locations
that fringe the eastern edge of the Balcones Escarpment (Quigg et al., 2014, Figure 5-3). Each site is geographically situated on or within a zone of high-quality

240

nodule and ledge cherts that may have served as source material. Gahagan bifaces found at these sites are represented by complete and incomplete specimens
in varying stages of manufacture, use, maintenance, and discard. This indicates
that bifaces were a commonly employed component of the overall lithic technology of central and east central Texas aboriginal groups, and likely used to

245

perform a variety of common tasks.
A recent study tested the hypothesis that the manufacture of flat, thin bifaces—like Gahagan bifaces—would have yielded flatter bifacial thinning flakes
that express low flake curvature (Quigg et al., 2014). The goal of that undertaking was to identify whether the flakes were distinctive enough on their own

250

to warrant the assignment of potential Gahagan biface production locales, providing indirect evidence for association with the Prairie Caddo model (Shafer,
2006) in the absence of diagnostic artefacts (Quigg et al., 2014). The results of
that study demonstrated that bifacial thinning flake curvature was not sufficient
as a marker of Gahagan biface production locales (Quigg et al., 2014).

255

In contrast to the Gahagan Mound, George C. Davis, and Mounds Plantation samples, there are currently no recorded instances of Gahagan bifaces
from contexts in central Texas that might be interpreted as mortuary, religious,
or ceremonial. Whether or not these bifaces served to denote individual status among hunter-gatherer groups is unknown, but they may have functioned
12

260

as such during contact, exchange, or interaction between hunter-gatherers and
Caddo groups to the east.
Production evidence is present at contemporary sites distributed on the eastern edge of the Balcones Escarpment. Sites like Urbankte (41CV26) and Penny
Winkle (41BL22 and 41BL23), Iron Bridge (41BL47), Hoxie Bridge (41WM130),

265

McDonald (41HI105), Loeve-Fox (41WM230), Grimes Houey (41CV17), J. B.
White (41MM341) and locations on Fort Hood, have all yielded specimens representing manufacture, use, and discard (Bond, 1978; Gadus et al., 2006; Miller
and Jelks, 1952; Prewitt, 1982; Shafer, 2006; Shafer et al., 1964). Shafer posited
that these bifaces were manufactured through a mix of hard and soft hammer

270

percussion, as well as indirect percussion using a punch (Shafer, 2006, 1973).
Flake scar patterns on many Gahagan bifaces support the inference that indirect
percussion was used as a shaping and thinning technique. Isolated finds across
Bell, Williamson, Milam, McLennan, and other counties in central Texas suggest that Gahagan bifaces were manufactured and used in these areas (Shafer,

275

2006).
Analytical framework
This basic research endeavour (Bush, 1945) consists of an exploratory analysis (Figure 4), and enlists the tools of geometric morphometrics to test whether
Gahagan biface shape, size, and form differs between two archaeological regions.

Landmark-based geometric morphometric methods are ideal for research designs
that incorporate questions of complex 3D geometry. Examples from the literature cover a broad scope of artefact categories including projectile points (Shott,
2011; Shott and Trail, 2010), bifaces (Archer and Braun, 2010; Archer et al.,
2015, 2016; Selden Jr. et al., 2018), percussive tools (Caruana et al., 2014), flake

285

scars (Sholts et al., 2012), flake tools (Archer et al., 2017), handaxes (Lycett,
2009; Lycett et al., 2010, 2015; Lycett and von Cramon-Taubadel, 2013; Wang
et al., 2012), and Caddo ceramics (Selden Jr. et al., 2014; Selden Jr., 2017,
2018b,a, 2019a,b).

captivated analysts of material culture due to the substantive contribution of
morphology to both ceramic and lithic typologies (Fox, 2015; Girrulat, 2006;
Thulman, 2012, 2019; Topi et al., 2017; Wilczek et al., 2014, 2015), as well as
additional categories of material culture (Barceló, 2010; Chitwood, 2014; Lenardi
and Merwin, 2010; Ros et al., 2014; Windhager et al., 2012). Applications of geo-

295

metric morphometrics in archaeology began with an analysis of irregular shapes
by elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) (Gero and Mazzullo, 1984), and methodological improvements continue to expand research potential for analyses of shape
as it relates to material culture (Figure 5).
The series of geometric morphometric studies focused upon Caddo ceram-

300

ics has capitalised on the morphological variation that occurs along a single
plane; however, 3D data were required to systematically identify the widest vessel profile. The Gahagan bifaces used in the previous study come from many
of the same contexts as the Caddo bottles, and were found to differ in morphology across the same shape boundary (Selden Jr. et al., 2018; Selden Jr.,

305

2019b, Figure 15.1). The current study leverages a suite of analytical tools that
have allowed for the incorporation of morphological attributes associated with
beveling, which occurs with some regularity along the lateral edges of Gahagan
bifaces.

Methods
310

Each of the Gahagan bifaces was scanned with a Creaform GoSCAN 20 at
a 0.3 mm resolution in VXelements. Scanner calibration was optimised prior to
each scan with positioning targets required for increased accuracy and shutter
speed reconfigured in each instance. A clipping plane was established to reduce
the amount of superfluous data collected. Following data collection, the resolu-

315

tion of each mesh was increased to 0.1 mm, and the point cloud was transferred
to VXmodel where the mesh was rendered following application of the clean
mesh function, used to remove isolated patches, self-intersections, spikes, small
holes, singular vertices, creased edges, narrow triangles, outcropping triangles,
narrow bridges, and non-manifold triangles prior to decimation and export as

320

ASCII stl and ASCII ply files. The stl functions as a 3D print-ready backup
of the scan data, and the ply file was subsequently processed using the Rvcg
library in R 3.6.1 (Schlager, 2017; R Core Development Team,, 2020; Selden Jr.,
2020).
There is a residue adhering to seven Gahagan bifaces from the George C.

325

Davis site at variable thickness (Selden Jr. et al., 2018, Figure 2). Shafer (1973,
228) posits that this residue potentially represents the remains of a sheath.
15

While an interesting aside, the residue does pose a problem for an analysis of
3D geometry. The initial research design (3D) was thus revisited, leading to a
reconfiguration of the previous analysis as a 2D geometric morphometric study
330

(Selden Jr. et al., 2018), enlisting a landmark configuration similar to that used
by Buchanan and Collard (2010, Figure 2), Buchanan et al. (2011, Figure 2),
and Ragan and Buchanan (2018, Figure 1). The residue does not occur on all
of the George C. Davis specimens, and none of the Gahagan bifaces from the
Mounds Plantation or Gahagan Mound sites include a similar residue on their

335

surfaces, making it possible to compare a greater range of surface morphology
between those samples.
The same basic constellation of landmarks was employed for this undertaking; however, unlike the previous iteration where landmarks were projected onto
a 2D spline, landmarks in this iteration were plotted directly on the 3D spline,

340

providing a means of capitalising on shape variation introduced through the
practise of beveling. This configuration of landmarks will be revised for subsequent analyses, where additional semilandmarks will be added to capture morphological attributes associated with latitudinal and longitudinal cross-sections.
The evolution of this research programme is focused not only upon aggregating

345

additional specimens, but capitalising on the various morphological nuances and
complexities included in those designs. Two specimens in the George C. Davis
sample (4078-8 and 4078-72), both from Feature 134, are missing small sections
of their lateral edges (Figure 2 p3, w3). For the purpose of the GM analysis,
these areas were modeled, and the surface of the mesh was extended to include

350

the area of the missing piece in both instances.
Alignment and Landmarks
The auto3dgm library (Boyer et al., 2015) was used in in R 3.6.1 (R Core
Development Team,, 2020) to align the meshes using principal alignments calculated by minimising Procrustes distance between pseudolandmarks. Subjective

355

parameters used in the alignment included 250 initial points, and 1000 final
points. The algorithm exported the aligned scans and a 3D image associated
16

with the alignment and minimum spanning tree (MST) (Figure 6). The output
from auto3dgm included the aligned meshes, an image of the resized and aligned
meshes, and the MST. The image of the aligned bifaces produced by auto3dgm
360

(Figure 6a) was used as the basis for orienting the scans in 3D space throughout
the landmarking process. The addition of auto3dgm into this workflow aids in reducing investigator bias—although algorithmic bias is still introduced—through
providing a method of selecting which face of each Gahagan biface faces toward
the investigator during the landmarking process. The MST (Figure 6b) has

365

utility in generating hypotheses that can be tested in subsequent analyses. The
alignment using auto3dgm was initially run in R (Figure 6), but the final alignment was run in SlicerMorph (https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph),
where mirroring could be turned off.

orientation of each biface provided in the auto3dgm output was used to orient the 3D meshes
in advance of applying landmarks, and the MST can be used for hypothesis generation.

The digit3DLand library (https://github.com/morphOptics/digit3DLand)
370

was used in R 3.6.1 (R Core Development Team,, 2020) to develop the landmark
configuration employed in this study (Table 1). The shift to a 3D analysis was
made due to the amount of beveling that occurs across the sample of Gahagan
bifaces. The same basic configuration of landmarks and semilandmarks used in
the previous study (Selden Jr. et al., 2018, Figure 3) was repurposed in this

375

iteration; however, these landmarks and semilandmarks were placed directly on
17

the mesh, providing a means of capitalising on the curvature that occurs along
the sinuous lateral edges.

The final landmarking protocol developed for this study (Selden Jr., 2020)
enlisted Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2019.0.2 [Build Number: 78]) to
380

generate a spline around the periphery of each biface, and to populate the landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks in a replicable manner using mathematicallydefined criteria. The 3D landmark configuration increases both the precision and
rigour of the study by including the z-dimension to capture those morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting that are introduced through

385

the practise of bifacial beveling. This landmarking protocol represents an intermediate iteration between the previous 2D analysis (Selden Jr. et al., 2018),
and the forthcoming protocol that includes semilandmarks placed on a series of
equidistant cross-sections. The cross-sections increase the coverage of semilandmarks across the mesh topology, providing for greater precision in the analysis

390

of morphology for the whole object. The evolution of this landmarking protocol
represents a concerted effort to better comprehend the vagaries of morphological similarities and differences among Gahagan bifaces. While true that some
landmarking protocols can be—and often are—recycled as new specimens are
added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater

395

accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration.
Unlike the previous study, where the outline of each Gahagan biface was
projected onto a 2D plane, this effort enlists a spline extracted from the surface
geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command to detect and

18

extract 3D contour curves from high-curvature areas of the mesh (Figure 7).
400

The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest
curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following
the highly variable morphology of the sinuous edge around the entirety of the
biface (Figure 7). The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon
this spline, which was then split at four locations.

The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933). The first landmark (LM1) is
placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Gahagan biface. The second
and third splits (LM2 and LM3) occur at points of highest curvature, and LM2
is always split on the right side of the biface when oriented in 3D space following

410

the alignment output of auto3dgm illustrated in Figure 6a. To place the final
landmark (LM4), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point
equidistant between LM2 and LM3. The location of that point was leveraged
in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM4.

19

Spline split at location of LM1
415

The horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the
tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal
as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the
horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent
in the 2D sketch (Figure 8, a), followed by a reference plane (Figure 8 in white,

420

a and b) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point
(h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the right plane as the normal axis
(Figure 8, a). The 3D spline was then cut at the location where the reference
plane intersected with the spline (Figure 8, a).
Spline split at locations of LM2 and LM3

425

The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated
using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser (Figure 8, c and d). This
function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area
of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a
geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The

430

curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and
is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool,
the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral
edges on either side of each biface where the local radius measure was largest
(Figure 8, c and d). The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated

435

by the auto3dgm output, and the landmarking protocol follows the output mesh
orientation, where LM2 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge,
and LM3 on the left.
Spline split at location of LM4
One additional landmark (LM4) was placed at the centre of the base. The

440

location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a reference point equidistant between the
two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the

right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of
the reference plane and the basal spline (Selden Jr., 2020).
445

Final configuration
Through the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into four discrete
splines. These splines articulate with components of bifacial morphology that
21

can be compartmentalised in the subsequent analyses (i.e., blade/base morphological integration, etc.) (Selden Jr., 2020). This rigourous landmarking proto450

col provides the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of
Gahagan biface morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis (Selden Jr., 2020). Landmarks 1-4
were placed at the location of each spline split (blue points, below). Equidistant
semilandmarks were then added to each of the four splines; 20 between LM1 and

455

LM2, five between LM2 and LM4, five between LM4 and LM3, and 20 between
LM3 and LM1 (Selden Jr., 2020).
Superficially, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks appears
similar to the 2D configuration used in the previous study (Selden Jr. et al.,
2018). However, this landmarking protocol captures the morphological variation

460

that articulates with axial twisting introduced by knappers through the practise
of bifacial beveling (Figure 9) (Selden Jr., 2020). Thus, this constellation of
landmarks and semilandmarks provides for greater precision in the geometric
morphometric analysis, marking a substantive advancement in those analytical
protocols used to achieve a more complete and holistic analysis of Gahagan

465

biface morphology (Selden Jr., 2020).
Analysis
Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall, 1981,
1984; Slice, 2001), achieved through generalised Procrustes superimposition
(Rohlf and Slice, 1990) performed in R 3.6.1 (R Core Development Team,, 2020)

470

using the geomorph library v.3.1.2 (Adams et al., 2017; Adams and OtárolaCastillo, 2013). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the
coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower, 1975; Rohlf
and Slice, 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to

475

alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear
space (Rohlf, 1999; Slice, 2001).
Principal components analysis (Jolliffe, 2002) was used to visualise shape

variation among the bifaces. The shape changes described by each principal
axis are commonly visualised using thin-plate spline warping of a reference
480

3D mesh (Klingenberg, 2013; Sherratt et al., 2014). A residual randomisation permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for
all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer, 2015; Collyer and Adams, 2018),
which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns
in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak, 2003). To as-

485

sess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region),
Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall, 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions
(Collyer et al., 2015). Procrustes variance was used to discriminate between
regions and compare the amount of shape variation (morphological disparity)

490

(Zelditch et al., 2004), estimated as the Procrustes variance using residuals of
linear model fit (Adams et al., 2017).

23

Results
The mean consensus configuration and Procrustes residuals were calculated
using a generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA) (Mitteroecker and Gunz, 2009,
495

Figure 3) (Figure 10). This initial view of the dataset can be used to illustrate
the morphological variation that occurs in each region and throughout the combined sample. As an exploratory measure, GM methods—to include GPA—aid
in clarifying shape differences associated with each population and in the production of novel a posteriori hypotheses (Mitteroecker and Gunz, 2009). The

500

mean consensus configuration for the sample from each region points toward
a potentially significant difference in Gahagan biface morphology between the
southern Caddo area and central Texas. Further information and detail related
to the analytical outputs used in this study can be found in the supplementary
materials (Selden Jr., 2020).

GPA, including the code needed to reproduce these results, can be found in the supplemental materials at https://github.com/aksel-blaise/gahaganmorph2/blob/master/analysis/baseanalysis.md (Selden Jr., 2020).

505

Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on scaled, translated,
and rotated landmarks, and demonstrates that the first two PCs account for
62.46 (PC1) and 14.48 (PC2) percent of the variation in Gahagan biface shape

24

(Figure 11) (Selden Jr., 2020). Together, PC1 and PC2 account for over 77
percent of shape variation for Gahagan bifaces, with each remaining PC repre510

senting less than six percent of the variation (Selden Jr., 2020). The first two
PCs are plotted in Figure 11, where the consensus configuration (gray) and
landmarks (black) represent the shape changes along PC1 and PC2. This plot
indicates that shape changes associated with PC1 articulate with blades that
range from broad at the minimum to narrow at the maximum, and base shapes

515

that range from flat to slightly concave. Shape changes associated with PC2
are dominated by differences in shapes that range from a narrow blade with a
broad convex base at the minimum to a broad blade with a narrow concave base
at the maximum.

listing of results and the code needed to reproduce the results, can be found in the supplemental materials at https://github.com/aksel-blaise/gahaganmorph2/blob/master/analysis/baseanalysis.md (Selden Jr., 2020).

25

A Procrustes ANOVA was then used to test whether a significant difference
520

exists in biface shape by (centroid) size, and results do indicate a significant
difference in allometry (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.07453; Pr(>F) = 6e-04)
(Figures 12 and 13) (Selden Jr., 2020). A second Procrustes ANOVA was used
to test whether a significant difference exists in biface shape by region (southern
Caddo area compared with central Texas), and results do indicate a significant

525

difference in biface shape by region (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.13905; Pr(>F) =
1e-04) (Selden Jr., 2020). A comparison of mean consensus configurations was

trends associated with Gahagan bifaces will be warranted in subsequent studies. In biology and biological anthropology, where these tools were developed,
Figure 12 (right) would be read from left-to-right as the size of the biological specimen increases. However, lithic production and use is representative of
535

a reductive process, meaning that this figure must be read from right to left,
where instead of reflecting a potential morphological convergence in the form of
biological specimens, it illustrates a potential morphological divergence in the
form of Gahagan bifaces. This result could be bolstered by a study of Gahagan biface retouch. Through characterising retouch, hypotheses regarding the

540

morphological trajectories associated with resharpening can be developed and
tested.
Similarly, by reading Figure 13 from left to right, or right to left, it may be
tempting to infer a morphological continuum. However, these two populations
of Gahagan bifaces differ significantly in shape and size (Figure 14), as demon-

545

strated by the results of the ANOVAs (Selden Jr., 2020). The primary driver of

27

those shape differences that discriminate between Gahagan bifaces from central
Texas and the southern Caddo area is basal morphology (Figures 13 and 14).

represented by gray spheres, and the central Texas region by linear vectors.

The test of morphological disparity by shape yielded a result that is not
significant (Selden Jr., 2020). This indicates that the Gahagan bifaces from the
550

southern Caddo area and central Texas occupy a range of morphospace that is
similar, allowing for the interpretation that neither population was participating
in a practise (whether production or retouch) that led to a more morphologicallyrestricted method of biface manufacture (i.e., specialisation). However, the test
of morphological disparity by size yielded a significant result (Selden Jr., 2020).

555

This result demonstrates that the Gahagan bifaces from the southern Caddo
area exhibit a greater diversity in size than the central Texas sample.

Discussion
This comparison of the largest assemblages of Gahagan bifaces recovered
from the southern Caddo area and central Texas highlighted differences in the
560

spatial (Figure 1), temporal (Figure 3), and morphological characteristics

28

(Figures 10 - 14) associated with previously classified specimens (Selden Jr.,
2020). The shift from a 2D to a 3D analysis allowed for the inclusion of those
morphological attributes (axial twisting) associated with the practise of beveling
(Figure 15), which was found to be more pronounced in the central Texas
565

sample (Selden Jr., 2020). Differences in form (shape + size) also indicate
potentially divergent Gahagan biface morphologies between the two regions, a
characteristic that is most pronounced in the smallest specimens (Figure 12)
(Selden Jr., 2020). Given the significant differences exhibited in the morphology
of Gahagan bifaces from the two regions, paired with noteworthy differences in
temporal and spatial attributes, it is concluded that these bifaces represent

Further work will be necessary to bolster the central Texas sample to include additional Gahagan bifaces from that region. The difference noted be-

29

tween the central Texas and southern Caddo area samples may align with mor575

phological differences that occur between Gahagan and Friday bifaces (Turner
and Hester, 1999, 254-255). Friday bifaces were described by Jelks (1962), are
distributed across central Texas, and include a temporal range from the Late
Archaic through the Late Prehistoric (Turner and Hester, 1999, 254).
A theoretical discrepancy related to Gahagan biface size

580

Biface size was found to differ significantly between the southern Caddo area
and the central Texas region (Selden Jr., 2020). This was demonstrated in the
results of this geometric morphometric study, which can also be visualised in
a simple comparison of centroid size by region (Selden Jr., 2020). The bulk of
the southern Caddo area sample comes from burial contexts, and little work

585

has been carried out to characterise the raw material used in Gahagan biface
production. While one group of investigators discerned that Gahagan bifaces
had been manufactured using Woodford, Battiest, and Ogallala cherts, as well as
cherts from the Kiamichi Mountains (Banks and Winters, 1975), it is generally
believed that the bulk of Gahagan bifaces from the southern Caddo area were

590

crafted using Edwards chert from central Texas. Thus, those bifaces found
closest to the source of raw material (central Texas) are smaller than those found
at a greater distance from the raw material source (southern Caddo area).
That the size of Gahagan bifaces recovered nearest the (presumed) raw material source in central Texas is generally smaller than those found in the southern

595

Caddo area is an observation that has not been previously noted. Further work
is warranted to assess retouch on this sample of Gahagan bifaces. Should it be
determined that the central Texas sample is more heavily retouched than the
sample from the southern Caddo area, then—when combined with the differences in spatial, temporal, and morphological attributes characterised in this

600

study—those Gahagan bifaces found in central Texas may have enjoyed an appreciably different cultural function than those found in the southern Caddo
area.
Shafer (2006) has posited that the presence of Gahagan bifaces in cen30

tral Texas, when found in tandem with additional diagnostic artefacts (i.e.,
605

Caddo ceramics, metapoidal beaming tools, bone needles, or Bonham-Alba arrow points) represents a possible connection to the occupants of the George C.
Davis site. While that may indeed be possible, this study demonstrates a fundamental difference in the size, shape, and form of Gahagan bifaces from central
Texas, indicative of a previously unrecognised variant of Gahagan bifaces, or

610

what may be a different type of biface altogether.
Future directions
There are substantive challenges associated with the interpretation of Gahagan biface morphology. Shafer (1973) notes that the makers of Gahagan bifaces
likely resided at or near a location with ample raw materials. The working the-

615

ory that Gahagan bifaces were not a product of Caddo manufacture is further
evidenced by the absence of production failures at Caddo sites, and the absence
of similar, locally-sourced raw materials. In a comparison of lithic reduction
strategies, Shafer (1974) compared the debitage sample from the western excavations at the George C. Davis site with that of 41MQ4, an Archaic (preceramic)

620

site located around 100 km south of the Davis site, where raw material quality
likely posed similar limitations on makers. Results indicated that the reduction
strategy employed by the Caddo at George C. Davis was distinct from that of
the Archaic sample (Shafer, 1974). That the Caddo are thought to have employed a distinct lithic reduction strategy is key to the interpretation of Caddo

625

stone tools, which may be further evidenced through retouch or refurbishment
efforts. However, discriminating between patterns of Gahagan biface flake scars
and debitage manufactured by central Texas knappers (Quigg et al., 2014) and
those made later by the Caddo is a substantive challenge that has not been
addressed.

630

While true that many biface types may not warrant the time and labour
investment associated with 3D data collection and analysis, 3D is necessary
for the study of Gahagan bifaces. Morphological attributes associated with
axial twisting and beveling hold substantive analytical value beyond the current
31

study, and those data will be employed in a variety of ballistic simulations
635

akin to the efforts of Lipo et al. (2012). Due to the amount of axial twisting
and beveling across the sample, other geometric morphometric approaches—like
those aimed at discriminating among flaking patterns using EFA (Sholts et al.,
2012; Gingerich et al., 2014; Sholts et al., 2017)—do not work for Gahagan
bifaces. As a means of expanding upon these efforts, the next iteration of the

640

analysis will include landmarks that articulate with a series of longitudinal crosssections placed between the semilandmarks along the lateral edges (Figure 16,
left).

Figure 16: Degree of axial twisting calculated between two vectors placed between landmarks
2 and 3, and semilandmarks 5 and 54.

Although not a component of the current analysis, attributes associated with
retouch are expected to articulate with beveling. Previously published methods
645

of codifying and analysing retouch (Andrefsky, 2006; Smallwood, 2010) are being
integrated into this analytical programme, and another measure is under active
development. Further work is needed to refine the latter approach; however, the
measure is introduced here as it may hold value for studies that are currently
32

planned or underway.
650

Enlisting the reference geometry used in the development of the current landmark configuration, the measure is comprised of an angle that occurs between
two linear vectors. To calculate the angle from the aligned mesh, one vector
is placed between landmarks 2 and 3 (base), then another between semilandmarks 5 and 54 (immediately below the tip) (Figure 16, right), after which the

655

angle between the two vectors can be calculated. It is not known whether this
measure will correlate with those associated with retouch. However, should this
angle be found to correlate with attributes related to retouch, size, spin torque,
or other useful measures, it could hold value in future analyses.

Conclusion
660

Through the enlistment of the largest samples of Gahagan bifaces found
across two geographic regions, this 3D geometric morphometric study highlights
those significant morphological differences that occur between Gahagan bifaces
recovered from central Texas and the southern Caddo area. The shift to a 3D
analysis also allowed for the added observation that axial twisting is more appre-

665

ciable in the central Texas sample than in the sample from the southern Caddo
area. Whether these differences in shape, form, and size are representative of
different uses, or an altogether different biface type (or unrecognised Gahagan
variant) remains unknown. Further work will be necessary to incorporate Gahagan bifaces from additional sites to begin parsing the more nuanced variation in

670

Gahagan biface morphology. Studies of raw material and retouch would further
increase the resolution of these results, perhaps aiding in clarifying the possible
functions of these different biface shapes.
