ABSTRACT

18

Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are now the most widely distributed wild large mammal in the

19

world and they cause dramatic impacts on agriculture and the environment. Wild pigs were first

20

introduced to the Canadian prairies in the 1980s and are now present in all Canadian provinces

21

except those in the farthest east in Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince

22

Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador). A telephone survey was conducted with 3007

23

rural Canadians in all ten provinces in order to quantify the level of awareness and concern

24

regarding invasive wild pig impacts in their province. Rural Canadians have overall low

25

awareness of the presence of wild pigs in their region. As expected, awareness of wild pigs was

26

lowest in provinces where they were absent or rare (<10% of respondents aware in British

27

Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada), low in the two provinces where wild pigs are

28

well established and relatively widespread in rural areas (22% of respondents aware in Alberta

29

and Manitoba), and moderate awareness in the one province with by far the most expansive

30

distribution of wild pigs (42% of respondents aware in Saskatchewan). In Atlantic Canada where

31

there are no known wild pigs, 2% of respondents incorrectly indicated that they were aware of

32

their presence. Concerns regarding impacts were overall moderate to low, with no province

33

having a mean concern level ≥ 7 out of 10) for crop damage, livestock predation and harassment,

34

structural damage, environmental impacts, threats to native wildlife, disease transmission to

35

humans, or disease transmission to wildlife and livestock, and threats to human safety and well-

36

being. Since rural Canadians experience the direct and indirect impacts from invasive wild pigs,

37

our findings will inform management efforts and help to effectively engage rural Canadians in

38

this rapidly emerging crisis. Communication and collaboration efforts through a range of

39

conventional and social media are needed to help inform rural Canadians about the presence of

40

wild pigs and the associated risks and impacts. Our findings help explain the overall very low

41

effort in most of Canada to develop management strategies and implement control efforts.

45
46

Invasive wild pigs, Sus scrofa, also called wild boar, feral pig, or feral swine (Keiter et al. 2016)

47

are one of the most prolific invasive species in the world and they are rapidly becoming the most

48

widely distributed mammal in the world (Lewis et al. 2017, Keiter and Beasley 2017). Wild pigs

49

were originally native to Eurasia and North Africa, and have now spread to every continent

50

except Antarctica (Mayer and Brisbin 2008, Lewis et al. 2017). As an invasive species they pose

2

51

a serious threat to native species and ecosystems as well as agricultural production on a global

52

scale (Keiter and Beasley 2017, McClure et al. 2017). Free-ranging wild pigs are not new to the

53

North America (Schlichting et al. 2016). Wild pigs were first introduced to the United States in

54

the 16th century, but have had a more recent introduction into Canada (Brook and Van Beest

55

2013).

56
57

Domestic Eurasian wild boar were brought to Canada in the 1980s and 1990s as part of an

58

extensive livestock diversification program (Brook and Van Beest 2014, Michel et al. 2017).

59

Over the last 35 years, wild pigs have escaped from domestic wild boar meat production and

60

penned shoot farms, or in some cases were purposely released into the wild when farming was

61

unsustainable or to create new hunting opportunities (Aschim and Brook 2019). Free ranging

62

populations continue to expand exponentially, since wild pigs have very few natural predators,

63

and are generalist feeders (Snow et al. 2017). They are highly fecund, having multiple litters per

64

year, averaging six young per litter in western Canada (Koen et al. 2018). Wild pigs are a long-

65

lived species and can reach >12 years (Michel et al. 2017). Where hunting occurs, mean life

66

expectancy is typically lower (Jezierski 1978). Continuing releases and escapes from existing

67

domestic operations also contribute to population expansions (Koen et al. 2018, Aschim and

68

Brook 2019). Current wild pig range within Canada is >750,000 km2 and expanding at a rate of

69

88,000 km2 per year (Aschim and Brook 2019).

70
71

The potential for economic and environmental impacts from wild pigs in Canada is high (Brook

72

and Van Beest 2013, Michel et al. 2017) and is consistent with risks and impacts documented

73

across their native and introduced ranges (Barrios-Garcia 2012). Wild pigs can cause damage to

3

74

ecological communities by altering the biodiversity and community composition of native

75

species, even to the point of local extirpation (Massei 2011, van Beest et al. 2015, McClure et al.

76

2018). Wild pigs depredate livestock and cause extensive crop damage, exceeding 1.5 billion US

77

dollars/year (McGregor et al. 2015). The main impacts include direct feeding on plants, rooting,

78

and trampling. Wild pigs harass and prey on lambs, goats, beef calves, and exotic game species

79

(Beach 1993). Wild pigs have also been observed to forage with livestock and wildlife at feeding

80

sites, which are potential sites for disease transmission (Beach 1993, Brook 2019). Free ranging

81

wild pigs can potentially carry and spread at least 30 viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens that

82

can impact human and livestock health (Meng et al. 2009, Podgorski et al.2018) and may

83

generate considerable public concern.

84
85

Human dimensions research has demonstrated the need for information on the attitudes of

86

stakeholders regarding impacts and risks of invasive species to inform management efforts

87

(Harper et al.2016). A common failure in invasive species management is the assumption that the

88

most effective methods to gather information on these non-native species are ecological,

89

biological, or laboratory methods (Rollins et al. 2007). Several ecological methods including

90

radio telemetry, camera trapping, or biomarkers have been used in the collection of information

91

regarding wild pig impacts, but often leave out events that are difficult to observe or hard to

92

quantify (Jori et al.2017). Brook and McLachlan (2008) demonstrated much value in the use of

93

local knowledge in wildlife research. The use of questionnaires and social sciences has proven to

94

be useful to assess the interactions between social and biophysical systems, and characterize the

95

attitudes of the public towards environmental issues (Jori et al.2017). Indeed, Beasley et al.

4

96

(2018) identified human dimensions as one of four research priority areas for wild pigs in North

97

America.

98
99

Effective wild pig management requires that managers have a comprehensive understanding of

100

issues, motivations and concerns from the perspective of stakeholders and the public (Massei et

101

al.2011). Our objectives in this study were to (1) determine rural Canadian understanding of the

102

presence of wild pigs in their region, (2) determine if the known distribution of wild pigs in each

103

province was positively correlated with the perceived awareness of rural Canadians regarding

104

wild pig presence, and (3) characterize the attitudes of rural Canadians toward the risks of wild

105

pigs and the need for management efforts, and. We predicted that levels of concern and support

106

for control efforts would be highest in provinces with the most extensive distribution of wild

107

pigs. We predicted that awareness of wild pig presence would be highest in provinces with the

108

most extensive areas occupied by wild pigs. We predicted that rural Canadians would have

109

moderate to low levels of concern regarding existing or potential wild pig impacts as they are

110

non-existent, newly emerging, or relatively recently established in all provinces in Canada.

111
112

STUDY AREA

113

Our study area included the rural areas of all ten Canadian provinces, encompassing an area of

114

6,062,951 km2 (Statistics Canada 2011). The country was stratified by province and then further

115

stratified by Canada Post Forward Sortation Area’s (FSAs) within each province, based on the

116

Canada Post definition of a rural area. The study area transitions across Canada from the Pacific

117

Maritime ecozone on the west coast to the Atlantic Maritime ecozone on the east coast (Table 1).

118

The study area is comprised of extensive agricultural cropland, deciduous and coniferous forests,

5

119

grasslands, wetlands, and montane ecosystems. The human population in rural areas across the

120

Canadian provinces totaled 6,282,649 people, with an average overall human density of 1.04

121

people/km2 (Statistics Canada 2011, unpublished data).

122
123

Wild pigs are established in all Canadian provinces except in the farthest east in Atlantic Canada

124

(New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) (Table 1).

125

The majority of wild pigs are found in agricultural areas across the three Prairie Provinces of

126

Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The spatial distribution of wild pigs in Canada has been

127

mapped in detail at the level 9 watershed scale by Aschim and Brook (2019). There are currently

128

no population estimates or numbers of annual harvest recorded. Sport hunting of wild pigs across

129

Canada is regulated differently in each province under agriculture and/or environmental policies,

130

with most provinces allowing sport harvest.

131
132

METHODS

133

Survey Design

134

We conducted a telephone survey of rural Canadians based on a stratified random design (survey

135

available online in Supporting Information). The sample size target for the number of

136

respondents in each province was based on a stratified design that scaled to each provinces rural

137

population size. Contact information was randomly selected from within the Canada Post FSAs.

138

The target population for this survey was one individual from each household that was at least

139

≥18 years of age and was having the next birthday. The survey sample population excluded

140

residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut as there are currently no known

141

occurrences of wild pigs in these three territories (Aschim and Brook 2019). The total number of

6

142

households the survey aimed to reach was 3000. If the household reached declined to participate

143

or were unreachable, another household was called in their place. Survey interviews were

144

completed during February and March of 2016, to utilize the time of the year that rural residents

145

tend to be the most accessible. Survey data were collected by the Social Science Research

146

Laboratory call center at the University of Saskatchewan. Survey participants were given the

147

option of responding in either French or English, and French responses were translated by

148

individuals that were fluent. The survey instrument included questions based around several

149

themes, but for the purpose of this paper we examined the questions that included: perceived

150

knowledge of wild pig presence in the area of the respondents, attitudes toward wild pig

151

presence, risks, impacts, and need for management action. Survey participants were asked to

152

give a score of 1 (no concern) to 5 (high concern) to the question: Wild boar presence in your

153

province is a critical current concern. The remainder of the questions examined in this paper used

154

a scale of 1 (Strongly disagree) to 10 (Strongly agree). Participants were also given the option to

155

refuse the question or to answer, “I don’t know”. They were asked to provide their postal code in

156

order to spatially reference each respondent. Participation was optional, participants were

157

reminded they could end the interview at any time, and all aspects of survey design and

158

implementation were approved by the University of Saskatchewan Behavioural Research Ethics

159

Board protocol BEH 15-155.

160
161

DATA ANALYSIS

162
163

Rural Canadians responses to survey questions that related to questions regarding risks, impacts

164

and perceived need for management were summarized and mapped. We compared the known

7

165

area of each province occupied by wild pigs (from Aschim and Brook 2019) to the % of

166

respondents from the survey in each province indicating they were aware of wild pigs in their

167

area using regression analysis.

168
169

RESULTS

170
171

Our findings indicate a range of knowledge and concerns about wild pigs in rural Canada and

172

importantly, a low level of knowledge of the presence of wild pigs in each province, even where

173

they are already widespread and abundant. Overall 9% (SE ± 0.14) of rural Canadians were

174

aware of wild pigs in their rural area, with 91% of rural Canadians responding that they were

175

unaware of wild pig presence in their province. Participant awareness of wild pig presence varied

176

considerably by province (Figure 1), and was closely linked to the known overall distribution of

177

wild pigs in each province, with highest awareness in Saskatchewan (42% of respondents),

178

Alberta (21%), and Manitoba (21%) and relatively low (<10%) of participant awareness of the

179

presence of wild pigs in all other provinces where wild pigs are known to exist (all provinces

180

excluding Atlantic Canada) (Figure 2). While Aschim and Brook (2019) did not detect wild pigs

181

in the Atlantic Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland

182

and Labrador), 0.02% of residents did (most likely incorrectly) indicate that they were aware of

183

wild pigs in their province. Follow up phone calls to all participants in Atlantic Provinces that

184

indicated they had observed wild pigs in their province determined that none of the respondents

185

provided confirmation of sightings when asked directly.

186

8

187

Overall concern regarding invasive wild pigs was significantly and positively associated with the

188

area of distribution (km2) of wild pigs within the respondent’s province. Of the respondents,

189

Saskatchewan had the highest overall level of rural residents concern regarding crop damage,

190

livestock predation/harassment, structural damage, environmental impacts, threat to native

191

wildlife, disease transmission to wildlife and livestock, disease transmission to humans, and

192

threats to human safety and well-being was low to moderately high, with average level concern

193

on a scale of 1-10 to specific questions ranging from (x̄ = 3.5 to 6.9, table 2). Across all

194

provinces, Saskatchewan had the highest concern about all impacts and the lowest rates of

195

concern were found in Atlantic Canada (Figure 3). There was no significant difference between

196

the concerns of male and female respondents (t = 2.1; df = 1392; p = 0.89) regarding wild pig

197

presence. There was no significant difference between male and female respondents (t = 1.9; df =

198

1306; p = 0.87) regarding the statement ‘wild pigs should be eradicated from your province’.

199
200

DISCUSSION

201

Rural Canadians have highly variable awareness of the presence of wild pigs in their province

202

and this is best explained by the actual distribution of wild pigs in Canada, with respondent

203

awareness increasing with wild pig distribution. Level of concern of rural Canadians regarding

204

invasive wild pigs indicates that they are largely unaware of wild pig presence in their province.

205

Provinces that had a higher percent of respondents aware of wild pig presence, also had higher

206

levels of concern regarding invasive wild pigs. Overall awareness regarding invasive wild pigs is

207

highly correlated with overall distribution of wild pigs within the respondent’s province. The

208

provinces with the highest percent aware of wild pig presence in their province, also had the

209

highest area occupied by wild pigs. Saskatchewan has over 150,000 square kilometers of land

9

210

occupied by wild pigs (Aschim and Brook 2019) and 40% of rural Saskatchewan residents are

211

aware of this wild pig presence. In the Atlantic Provinces there are currently no recorded

212

sightings or documentation of wild pig presence and subsequently there is < 1% of rural

213

residents aware of wild pigs in their province. Since most rural residents are unaware of wild pig

214

presence within their province, their feelings of concern over this invasive species are relatively

215

low as they are unacquainted with the negative impacts wild pigs can produce. In contrast, other

216

studies in the U.S. where wild pigs have been well established such as Illinois found relatively

217

high levels of concern, with 73% of respondents agreeing that ‘feral hogs are a source of

218

disease’, 12% of respondents agreeing that ‘feral hogs are not a threat to people’, and 84% of

219

respondents indicating that ‘feral hogs should be eliminated wherever possible (Harper et al.

220

2016). In Texas where wild pigs are widespread and abundant throughout the entire state, 89% of

221

study participants agreed that they were an agriculture pest, and 50% agreed that they are an

222

economic liability (Adams et al. 2005).

223
224

When asked to respond to the statement “Wild pig presence in your province is a critical current

225

concern” only 5% of respondents answered that they strongly agree. Over 60% of the

226

respondents answered that they strongly disagree that wild pig presence is a critical current

227

concern. If rural residents are unaware of wild pigs even being present in their province, it is

228

highly unlikely that they will think that the presence of these pigs is a concern. Many rural

229

residents may be unaware of wild pig presence in their province, even if a large area of their

230

province is occupied by wild pigs. Wild pigs are highly elusive and often active at night, making

231

them often difficult to detect (Stolle et al. 2015). Rural residents overall concern regarding crop

232

damage, livestock predation/harassment, structural damage, environmental impacts, threat to

10

233

native wildlife, disease transmission to wildlife and livestock, disease transmission to humans,

234

and threats to human safety and well-being were overall low to moderate. These concerns were

235

the lowest in provinces where wild pigs occupy <10,000 km2. Across all provinces,

236

Saskatchewan had the highest concern about all impacts and the lowest rates of concern were

237

found in Atlantic Canada. The higher levels of concern in Saskatchewan are correlated with the

238

increased area occupied by wild pigs of 159,176 km2. Since the area occupied by wild pigs in

239

Saskatchewan is the highest, there is a higher probability that a rural resident in Saskatchewan

240

would be aware of wild pig presence.

241
242

Although invasive wild pigs have been established in Canada since the 1990s (Aschim and

243

Brook 2019), prior to this study, there was an overall limited understanding of rural attitudes,

244

knowledge, and awareness of rural Canadians. Rural residents that have experienced damage

245

caused by invasive wild pigs are more likely to have strongly agreed that wild pig management is

246

necessary. The only previous study of rural attitudes about wild pigs was by Brook and van

247

Beest 2014) that found rural municipal leaders had similarly overall low levels of concern

248

regarding a range of risks and impacts, including damage to crop, pasture, and fences where

249

>50% of respondents felt these impacts were never serious.

250
251

The results of our work provide useful data for efforts aimed at eradicating and managing

252

wild pigs in Canada and provide essential insights to support in the event that Canada aims to

253

develop international, national, and provincial management plans. Currently only Alberta has a

254

wild pig management plan. The use of social sciences and questionnaires presents quantitative

255

insights from the rural public so managers are able to create informed opinions and decisions to

11

256

best serve their individual needs. Social survey data have been used successfully for informing

257

other controversial issues where potential for conflict is high (Brook and McLachlan 2006, 2009)

258

and to evaluate diverse management options (Brook et al. 2012). Since rural Canadians are the

259

ones who are or will be experiencing the impacts from invasive wild pigs, it is important to know

260

their opinions and attitude. This data can be highly valuable for management efforts and helps to

261

effectively engage rural residents in helping them better understand invasive species in their

262

direct surroundings in ways that conventional scientific research and biological monitoring

263

often fails to do (Devictor et al. 2010).
