Abstract
Research on the destinations of environmentally induced migrants has found simultaneous migration to both nearby and long-distance destinations, most likely
caused by the co-mingling of evacuee and permanent migrant data. Using a unique
dataset of separate evacuee and migration destinations, we compare and contrast the
pre– (2010), peri– (2011), and post– (2012-2013) migration systems of permanent
migrants and temporary evacuees of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.
We construct and compare prefecture-to-prefecture migration matrices for Japanese
prefectures to investigate the similarity of migration systems. We find evidence supporting the presence of two separate migration systems – one for evacuees and one
for more permanent migrants – where evacuees seem to emphasize short distance
migration while more permanent migrants emphasize migration to destinations with
pre-existing ties. Additionally, our results show that permanent migration in the
peri– and post-periods is largely identical to the pre-existing migration system. Our
results demonstrate stability in migration systems concerning migration after a major
environmental event.

Introduction

Environmentally induced migration and displacement is a key concern of global environmental change (Black et al. 2011, Findlay 2011, Hugo 2011, Mueller et al. 2014, Field et al.
2014), with climate change expected to spur migration and displacement (Warner et al.
2009, Gray & Wise 2016). How this environmentally induced migration differs from more
general migration is of key importance to understanding and modeling potential population
shifts associated with climate change this century (Rigaud et al. 2018).
Migration in response to environmental stressors oftentimes depends on the type of stressor (Gutmann & Field 2010, Hunter et al. 2013, Thiede & Brown 2013). Previous studies
have shown migration and displacement from rapid-onset environmental events (such as
tropical cyclones) leads to a dichotomous spatial concentration of migration toward nearby
areas (Curtis et al. 2015, Kayastha & Yadava 1985) and long-distance migration toward far
away areas (Hori et al. 2009). We contend that this dichotomy results from two distinct
migration pathways operating simultaneously: an evacuee pathway and a more permanent
migration pathway. We define evacuees as those who primarily make temporary, shortdistance migrations and we define migrants as those who primarily leverage preexisting
migration networks to make more permanent migration moves. Rectifying this dichotomy
will allow for better modeling of environmental migration but, due to data limitations,
post-disaster migration studies typically analyze evacuees and migrants in a single migration datum.
The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in March 2011, which ultimately lead
to the failure of the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant, prompted the Japanese government
to capture temporary, evacuee migration in a new data ecosystem, the Nationwide Evacuee
Information Exchange System, separate from the permanent migration universe. In combination with the official migration statistics, this provides a unique opportunity to parse
environmental migration into permanent and temporary classifications. This unique data
ecosystem allows us to empirically compare and contrast the migration pathways of permanent migrants and evacuees to address the dichotomous migration pathways observed
in literature.
In this paper, we focus on the destinations of migrants and evacuees after the Great
2

East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and we situate our results within Allan Findlay’s six
principles governing migration (Findlay 2011). In particular, we take a migration systems
approach to answer two fundamental questions about environmental migration: first, did
the disaster alter the destinations of out-migrants from the affected region? and second, do
evacuees and migrants share migration systems with the pre-disaster migration system and
with each other? The parsing of evacuees from migrants in the Japanese data collection
system allows for a novel approach in understanding post-disaster migration. Due to our
unique data sets, we can distinguish and compare the migration systems of evacuees and
migrants in response to an acute natural disaster. Our results show that (1) as expected,
the earthquake and tsunami increased the overall migration out of the region, but (2)
the destinations of more permanent migrants closely follows the pre-disaster, embedded
migration system and (3) evacuees exhibit markedly different destinations, tending to travel
short distances.

Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami

On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake occurred off the east coast of Japan —
the most powerful earthquake on record in that country and the fourth most powerful in
the world since record keeping began in 1900 (USGS 2014). This event triggered a tsunami
that was on average 10m high and up to 40m in height in some places (Sawa et al. 2013),
killing 15,871 people and injuring 6,114 more. An additional 2,778 people were still missing
and presumed dead up two years after the earthquake (Hasegawa 2013). Financial damages
were estimated near $160 billion ($US2011), with more than 300,000 residential buildings
damaged (International Medical Corps 2011, Takano 2011). The disaster culminated with
an accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant where, as of this writing, the long-term
implications of the plant’s failure are still unknown. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
called it “Japan’s worst crisis since the second world war” (Branigan 2011), and the damages
make it the second largest natural disaster in Japan’s modern history. Within three days of
the earthquake, an estimated 468,000+ people sought temporary refuge from the disaster.
By December of 2011, just eight months after the incident, 92,712 Fukushima residents
remained evacuated, 33,943 of whom were still living inside the prefecture, according to
3

the International Medical Corps’ Fukushima Prefecture Data Sheet (2011).
Iwate and Miyagi prefectures felt the brunt of the earthquake and ensuing tsunami
(Figure 1). Fukushima Prefecture, south of Miyagi, is home to the Fukushima-Daiichi
Nuclear Plant, where the cooling functions of the reactors failed, resulting in a meltdown
of the nuclear fuels and leakage of radioactive materials into the local environment (Takano
2011). These three prefectures accounted for approximately 82% of the damaged fishing
ports, nearly 91% of the damaged fishing boats, and 84% of the lost aquaculture due to
the earthquake and tsunami (Takano 2012). The majority of the casualties and evacuees
were also concentrated in these three prefectures (Isoda 2011).
Although much of the migration from the diaspora has been temporary, more permanent changes to Fukushima’s migration were felt almost immediately. Prior to the earthquake, the prefecture was already experiencing depopulation (Matanle 2013). However,
out-migration from Fukushima increased by 70% between 2010 and 2011, while in-migration
fell by 15%. This caused a change in the total net migration from -5,752 persons in 2010
to -31,381 in 2011, more than a five-fold increase in net out-migration in a single year
(Statistics Bureau Japan 2011). The disaster caused a Japan-wide diaspora of residents
most affected by the Tsunami and nuclear plant failure. All Fukushima Prefecture residents
within 20km of the plant were instructed to evacuate within four days of the earthquake.
Residents between 20km and 30km were advised to voluntarily evacuate (Council 2014).
Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of out-migrants from Fukushima, Iwate,
and Miyagi prefectures in 2010 and 2011. Table 1 reports the top five destinations from
these prefectures. Both Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures experience much larger outmigrations between 2010 and 2011, while Iwate experiences a much more modest increase
(22,131 in 2010 to 22,199 in 2011). The general destinations are relatively similar between
the two time periods as well. As Table 1 shows, the top five destinations in 2010 were
also the top five destinations in 2011 – even if both the magnitude of out-migration and
the exact ranking are different.
Additionally, Japan created a unique data collection system for processing evacuees
from the disaster. These evacuees are captured in a separate data collection system and
are not a part of the official migration statistics. By law, all Japanese nationals are required

to register their residency. However, many evacuees are unwilling to report their relocation, hoping to return home. The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs set up a new system
following the tsunami and nuclear reactor disaster for evacuees that allows a resident to
maintain their residency in their home prefecture while presently living in a different prefecture. Thus, evacuees from Fukushima Prefecture living in a nearby prefecture are still
counted as residing in Fukushima in the official population estimates of the Ministry of
Home Affairs while appearing in a nationwide evacuee database at their present prefecture.
While these data streams are not antiseptically “clean” from data problems, including dou-

7

ble counting, we are confident that they are valid enough to warrant the analysis to which
we subject them. We describe the National Evacuee Data System in greater detail in the
Data and Methods section.
Separating migrants from evacuees allows us to examine whether the two share a similar
migration system. We expect that evacuees will move to destinations near their place of
origin, whereas permanent migrants will follow social and human capital pathways. Our
analysis compares the permanent migration system to the evacuee system of Fukushima
residents. The permanent migration system data come from official Japanese government
counts. To capture the evacuee migration system, we take the number and locations of evacuees from Fukushima prefecture in June 2011 from Takashi Oda’s Grasping the Fukushima
Displacement and Diaspora (2011) and compare them with the 2004-2016 permanent migration data from the Statistics Bureau of Japan.

Environmental Migration

When examining environmental migration, the effect an environmental pressure has on a
migration system largely depends on the type of pressure. Droughts, tropical cyclones, and
tsunamis all affect a migration system differently. For instance, droughts might generate
migrants but generally do not generate evacuees, whereas tropical cyclones and tsunamis
can generate both. Similar research on the displacement of populations from flooding in
India finds that displacements tend to be localized, with migration along short-distances in
search of safer areas (Kayastha & Yadava 1985). Studies on Hurricane Katrina’s impact on
the Gulf Coast of the United States find similarly large out-flows to nearby areas with some
migration to distant locations (Frey et al. 2007, Hori et al. 2009, Stone et al. 2012, Curtis
et al. 2015). While these studies examine the geography of displacement, they provide
little or no temporal comparison to the pre-event migration system nor do they distinguish
evacuees from migrants.
Allan Findlay’s (2011) six principles governing migration provide key insights for understanding both evacuees and migrants1 . These six principles can be summarized into
three main findings: A) Potential migrants prefer to stay in their current residence, often

Findlay’s six principles: 1. Most migrants want to stay in their current place of residence.

8

called the immobility paradox, B) If people do move, they tend to move short distances,
and C) human capital and existing ties play a large role in determining destinations. We
anticipate that evacuees tend to migrate short distances while permanent migrants will
leverage human capital and existing ties in their location decisions.
Gutmann and Field (2010) developed a useful framework for understanding environmental effects on migration and have identified four types of environmental factors that
influence migration: (1) environmental calamities such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes, (2) environmental hardships such as drought or short periods of favorable weather,
(3) environmental amenities such as warmth, sun, or proximity to mountains and water, and
(4) environmental barriers such as heat, air conditioning, irrigation, etc. This framework
for environmental migration can be used to place historically significant environmental
events of the 20th century into analytically useful categories. The list of environmental
events or impacts is both long and wide and includes the American dust bowl of the 1930s
with migration from US midwest to California (McLeman & Smit 2006), air conditioning
making the US sunbelt a more attractive destination (Borts & Stein 1964, Graves 1980),
and Hurricane Katrina with its large population displacement (Fussell & Elliott 2009), for
instance.
These typologies – combined with Findlay’s six principles – provide a robust framework
for organizing research on environmental migration, yet previous research on environmental
migration is dominated by “who?” and “what?” questions. For example, many studies
have focused on who moves (Hori et al. 2009, Rivera & Miller 2007) and who returns
(Groen & Polivka 2010, Stringfield 2010, Thiede & Brown 2013). Much of the literature
has overlooked questions surrounding migrant destinations, leading to a gap in knowledge
about how environmental events affect migration systems and patterns over time. The
2. People tend to move over short distances rather than longer distances.
3. People do not always move to the most attrative destination but live/work nearer rather than farther.
4. Attraction to destinations can be interpreted as increased income or returns to ‘human capital.’
5. Destination selection is shaped by pre-existing social and cultural connections.
6. Destinations can be viewed as attractive because of the ‘social’ and ‘cultural capital’ they offer.

9

Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami is an environmental calamity, as identified
by Gutmann and Field (2010), with a data ecosystem that allows us to apply Findlay’s
(2011) six principles to two distinct populations in order to examine the similiarities and
differences in the destinations of evacuees and migrants. Based on Findlay’s framework, we
expect migrants to emphasize principles 4-6 regarding social capital and pre-existing ties
while evacuees will emphasize principles 2 and 3 regarding short distance moves.
Migration systems theory (MST) is a branch of migration research that uses all origindestination combinations as the object of study as opposed to any single origin-destination
pair (DeWaard et al. 2012, Fawcett 1989, Massey et al. 1994). A systems approach posits
that when one place experiences a change, the effect is manifested throughout the system.
Migration decisions – not just decisions to migrate, but also location decisions – are often
driven by the presence or absence of human capital as well as macro factors such as labor
force, economic vitality, anticipated increases in living standards, amenities, both natural
and economic, and so forth (Fawcett 1989, Haug 2008, Lee 1966, Pandit 1997, Thiede &
Brown 2013). This network of human capital embedded within the migration system tends
to drive locational decision making in the aftermath of environmental events (Findlay 2011,
Gray & Bilsborrow 2013, Hugo 2008, 2011, McLeman 2013, Schultz & Elliott 2013).
MST has been explicitly tied to environmental migration in recent years (Curtis et al.
2015, DeWaard et al. 2012, Fawcett 1989), with research examining both the stability of
such systems (DeWaard et al. 2012) as well as altered systems (Curtis et al. 2015, Fussell
et al. 2014). We build on this previous research and employ MST to explore the stability
of the Japanese migration system in the wake of a catastrophic event. In this paper, we
are not necessarily concerned with who moved and why, nor who returned and why, but
rather where people moved and whether permanent migrants and evacuees share migration
systems.

Data and Methods

4.1

Data

We describe the migration systems in Japan using two primary migration data sources.
Concerning permanent migration, we use the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication’s (MIC) annual series of Origin-Destination matrices of
prefecture-to-prefecture migration. Residents of Japan must register all changes of residence to their municipal governments for purposes of governance. It is from this population registry that the Statistics Bureau produces its annual series of internal migration.
Concerning more temporary, evacuee migration, we use data from the Nationwide Evacuee
Information Exchange System that was created in the aftermath of the earthquake and
tsunami.
4.1.1

Nationwide Evacuee Information Exchange System

In response to the earthquake and tsunami and to support rehabilitation of evacuees, the
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication (MIC), prefecture governments, and local
municipalities collaborated to produce a Nationwide Evacuee Information Exchange System on April 12, 2011 (Suzuki & Kaneko 2013). By June of 2011, over 1,700 municipalities
were participating in this exchange. The purpose of the system is to allow participating
governments to track and locate former residents. Evacuees voluntarily report their current
residence at their current municipal government (Umeda 2013, Oda 2011). The information is then passed to their home municipality and to the Reconstruction Agency, which
presently publishes the number of evacuees with the cooperation of local governments.
Evacuee data, by its nature, is variable across time and difficult to collect (Hasegawa
2013). Despite this limitation, the data in the evacuee exchange system is the most rigorous and complete information on the locations of evacuees available, though it surely does
not capture every evacuee since there is no legal obligation to participate. These data are
the official number of evacuees from the Japanese government.
Individual prefecture governments are largely responsible for disaster relief, making most
of the governmental response to the disaster shared between the national government, the

47 prefecture governments, and the 1700 municipalities (Aoki 2016) and is voluntary in
nature (Umeda 2013). Even evacuee participation in the exchange system is voluntary
and not compulsory. However there are numerous reasons why evacuees might participate.
In August 2011, Japan passed a law enabling certain administrative services of displaced
evacuees to be covered by the government in which they currently reside (Umeda 2013).
Evacuees are eligible for these administrative services, in addition to financial grants, special
loans, tax relief, unemployment benefits, emergency housing, relief from administrative
obligations, access to relief donations, and monetary compensation (Umeda 2013).
Evacuees might relocate to a different prefecture and participate in the evacuee system
without registering a change of address in their home prefecture. This is particularly
true for Fukushima evacuees because their displacement is at least partially caused by the
human-induced disaster. In other words, if evacuees change their registered address, it
might be considered that they voluntarily relocated themselves regardless of the accident
and could be ineligible for benefits. By registering with the nationwide evacuee database,
the registered evacuees can maintain their home address, receive municipal service from
the new location municipality, and receive postal mail documents concerning their public
support and services.
Official numbers published by the Reconstruction Agency show that more than 250k
people from Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures participated in the evacuee system
in December of 2011 but only 69k of these evacuees were displaced outside of their home
prefectures. Most people relocated within their home prefecture. By June of 2018, the
total number of evacuees inside these prefectures had fallen to 11k while 36k people were
still listed as evacuees outside their home prefecture, due in part to the availability of
permanent recovery apartments in the affected prefectures2 . Figure 3 shows the total
number of persons in the evacuee system who were displaced outside their home prefecture
for the three most impacted prefectures between 2011 and 2019.
The Reconstruction Agency publishes three primary pieces of information. (1) They
publish the total number of evacuees present in each prefecture, but not the origin prefecture of these evacuees. (2) They publish the type of accomodations in which evacuees

shelter. There are four facility types: (a) public shelters such as public halls or schools,
(b) hotels, (c) relatives/acquaintances, and (d) public/temporary housing including hospitals. In December of 2011, nearly 95% of evacuees were in public/temporary housing but
by June 2019, evacuees were nearly evenly split between public/temporary housing and
relatives/acquaintances. Finally, (3) they publish the number of evacuees located outside
of the three most impacted prefectures.
The Reconstruction Agency publishes total counts of evacuees, but not evacuees broken
down by origin and destination prefecture. However, individual municipalities have access
to the locations of their own displaced residents for administrative purposes. We use data
published by Takashi Oda (2011) on the location of evacuees from Fukushima Prefecture
for June 2011 as reported to Fukushima Prefecture via the evacuee information system.
The availability of evacuee data for only Fukushima Prefecture precludes an analysis of
evacuees from Iwate and Miyagi prefectures, though evacuees from Iwate and Miyagi who
relocated outside of their home prefecture total just 15% of the evacuees outside of their
home prefecture. The lack of socio-economic data on evacuees also precludes an analysis
of the socio-economic characteristics of evacuees.
Most displacement was localized within the prefecture (Koyama et al. 2014, Ishikawa
2012) likely due to local government responses. Some people evacuated via institutional
transportation provided by the local government while others evacuated using their own
means of transportation (Crimella & Dagnan 2011). Local governments relocated some
evacuees using lottery methods and group allocation (Koyama et al. 2014) and destination
prefectures voluntarily provided unoccupied public housing to evacuees (Umeda 2013).
Between 60 and 70% of local governments in Japan provided some form of aid to those
displaced by the disaster (INUI 2016). Every prefecture in Japan received some evacuees
(Figure 3).
The vast majority of evacuations and the governmental responses were voluntary and
highly varied. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) reports 95,100 residents evacuated from either the mandatory evacuation
zone of <20km from the plant or the voluntary evacuation zone between 20km and 30km of
the plant (UNSCEAR 2014a). Of the 18 identified compulsory evacuation scenarios, only

14

the 6,900 residents of Futaba Town in Fukushima Prefecture were forced to evacuate to a
destination outside of their home prefecture – to the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama Prefecture (UNSCEAR 2014b). Thus, less than 10% of those who evacuated from Fukushima
Prefecture to another prefecture were compelled to a particular destination outside of their
home prefecture.
Due to this largely decentralized governmental response and the voluntary nature of
the response, the extent to which individual municipalities shaped destinations is largely
unknown. Some people were forced to evacuate, others evacuated voluntarily; some people
were evacuated to specific locations, others had more freedom in destination location.
Approximately 100k of 450k+ evacuees were compulsory evacuees and, as stated above,
approximately 10% of those who evacuated outside of their home prefecture were steered
to a particular location. Since both the decision to evacuate and the destination were
largely voluntary, it seems unlikely that evacuee data reflects where the government chose
to resettle people rather than the migration decisions of the evacuees themselves. It is the
confluence of preferences, kin networks, social capital, and governmental responses that
shaped destination decisions.
Thus two avenues of reporting are available for those displaced by the earthquake and
tsunami: if a resident chooses to permanently relocate, they would be listed in the official prefecture-to-prefecture migration data, if a resident chooses to resettle in their home
prefecture at a later date, they would be listed in the Evacuee Exchange System. There
is certain to be some overlap between the two groups, but based on the reports from the
Reconstruction Agency, this overlap appears minimal. This allows for a unique decomposition of environmental flows between permanent migrants and evacuees. This distinction
between permanent migrants and evacuees may recede over time if evacuees settle in place.

4.2

Characterizing Migration

To assess permanent migration, we focus on the year preceding (2010), the year of the
disaster (2011), and the years immediately after the earthquake and tsunami (2012 and
2013). In terms of evacuees, we compare the 2010 migration system before the earthquake
to the diaspora of evacuees from Fukushima Prefecture in the post-disaster period (2012).

15

We characterize the migration system of Japan as several matrices representing the total
prefecture-to-prefecture migration as a proportion of total flows out of any given prefecture.
We use the proportionality of the flows, expressed as

Mi,j
,
Mi

the ratio of the migrants from

prefecture i to j to the total number of out migrants from prefecture i to investigate the
similarity in the migration systems.
We would anticipate changes in the number of migrants after a disaster of this magnitude, but are rather interested in seeing the changes in the structure of the migration
system. A set of matrices covering the period 2004-2016 represent the pre-disaster migration system (M (2004), ..., M (2010)), the peri-disaster migration system (M (2011)), and
the post-disaster migration system (M (2012), ..., M (2016)). We also construct a matrix
for the evacuees M (e) (utilizing data from the Evacuee Information Exchange System on
evacuees in February of 2012). These matrices take the following general form as shown in
Eq. 1 and 2.

These matrices have no “net” migrants and represent the complete picture of prefectureto-prefecture out-migration. The sum of any given row in the matrix will equal 1.0, representing the total probability distribution of flows from any given prefecture to any given
prefecture.

4.3

Calculating Migration System Differences

While the magnitudes of the flows can and should be different pre- and post- disaster, our
tests determine whether the overall structure of the flows to each prefecture changed in
16

the post-disaster period. For instance, in 2010 4.7% of all out-migrants from Fukushima
Prefecture went to Tochigi Prefecture (1,470 of 31,363 out-migrants) and 4.8% in 2011
(2,542 of 53,122). Despite a 73% increase in the number of migrants from Fukushima to
Tochigi, the proportion of out-migrants remained virtually unchanged. We are interested
in whether the migration systems between the time periods M(2011, 2012, 2013, e) differs
significantly from M(2010), not necessarily in the absolute changes in both in- and outflows.
By converting the origin-destination matrices into matrices of probability distributions
(ie the probability of moving from prefecture i to prefecture j), we can use statistical
distance metrics to quantify the similarity between two probability distributions. We utilize the Hellinger distance metric (Hellinger 1909, Pardo 2018) to quantify the similarity
and dissimilarity for each prefecture between time periods. Hellinger distance, H(P, Q),
describes the distance between two discrete probability distributions P = (pi , ...pk ) and
Q = (qi , ..., qk ).
The Hellinger distance has several useful qualities as a distance metric. First, the
distance value always lies between 0 and 1, where H=0 means distributions are identical.
And second, it fulfills the four conditions required for a distance measure to be a metric as
opposed to a divergence (such as the Kullback-Leibler Divergence) (Pardo 2018): it must be
non-negative; if p and q are the same then the distance must be zero; H(P, Q) = H(Q, P ),
implying symmetry; and it must obey the triangle inequality law.
The general Hellinger distance equation is defined in Eq. 3.

Where probability distribution P is the set of probabilities of migrating from prefecture
i to prefectures i to j in time period t and probability distribution Q refers to the time
period t + 1. By calculating H between each time period, we generate the distribution of
H to test for significance.
We calculate H between each consecutive time period for 2004-2015 and calculate a
standard z-score (z = (xi − µ)/σ) where µ is the mean of H over all prefecture-periods. We
also calculate H for the distribution of F ukushima2010 and Evacuees2011 to measure the
17

distance between the pre-existing migration system in Fukushima and that of the Evacuees.
Since the Hellinger distance is bounded by 0 and 1, we report significance based on a lognormal distribution.

Results

5.1

Statistical Distance

Figure 4 reports the results of the Hellinger distances comparing the annual differences
between 2004 and 2015 out-migration from each prefecture. The differences between any
given origin prefecture are relatively small for permanent out-migration (M (t)), with Yamagata Prefecture exhibiting the greatest difference among any yearly comparison (H =
0.11308) and Tokyo-to exhibiting the smallest difference (H = 0.00731). The mean Hellinger
distance is 0.03542 with a standard deviation of 0.01892.
Table 2 reports the Prefecture-Years exhibiting different Hellinger distances between
two years with positively significant different distances (α<=0.05).

5.2

Did the disaster alter the destinations of out-migrants from
the affected region?

In short: no. Table 3 shows the Hellinger distances and their significance for Fukushima,
Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures for the peri-disaster migration system. Only Miyagi Prefecture exhibits a significant difference between the pre-disaster migration system and peridisaster systems. Both Fukushima and Iwate prefectures exhibit non-significant differences.

Of the impacted prefectures, Fukushima Prefecture, which had such a well-documented increase in the out-migration and is traditionally the focal point of the migration effect, had
the least dissimilar peri-disaster migration system – just a mere 3.7% different from the
pre-disaster migration.
Even though Miyagi Prefecture’s difference is significant, it is only significant within the
universe of annual distances. In other words, Miyagi Prefecture’s peri-disaster migration
system is only 8.5% dissimilar from the pre-disaster migration system. While it is significant
compared to other annual changes, the actual magnitude of difference is relatively minor.
Additionally, if we examine the peri- and post-disaster migration systems with the predisaster migration systems for Fukushima, Iwate, and Miyagi, we again find very little
dissimilarity when compared to the pre-existing migration system (Table 4). None of
the Hellinger distances approach the level of dissimilarity as the Evacuees system. The
magnitude of the H-distance for the evacuee system is almost three times larger than

the greatest pair-wise distance computed. These results suggest that permanent migrants
continued to leverage the pre-existing migration system during and after the disaster and
that the evacuee migration system differs substantially from the pre-existing migration
system.

5.3

Do evacuees and migrants share migration systems with the
pre-disaster migration system and with each other?

As evidenced by Table 3 and Table 4, permanent migrants in the peri- and post-disaster
periods seem to share the pre-disaster migration systems. However, this is in stark contrast
to the Evacuees migration system (Figure 4) which is significantly dissimilar to the preexisting migration system (z-score = 5.14563).
What about the Evacuees migration system is different from the pre-existing migration
system? The Hellinger distance results demonstrate a clear schism between the migration
pathways of permanent migrants and the migration pathways of evacuees. These result
cannot tell us how the systems differ, however. Figure 5 presents the changes in the spatial
extent of the migration systems between out-migrants and evacuees by examining the
percent of the emigrants and evacuees from Fukushima to the six prefectures immediately
adjacent (Gumma, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Niigata, Tochigi, and Yamagata). Over the 2010-2013
period, between 33.6% and 35.9% of people who emigrated from Fukushima went to nearby
prefectures. This stands in stark contrast to the 46.1% of the evacuees who relocated to
surrounding prefectures, suggesting that evacuees tended to move to nearer locations in
larger numbers than typical out-migrants.

considerable spike in the % of Evacuees who went to the adjacent prefectures (approximately 45%), further suggesting the presence of different migration systems for permanent
migrants and evacuees.

difference. These results suggest permanent migrants in the most impacted prefectures
continued to leverage the pre-existing migration system during and after the disaster.

Discussion

Population displacement is expected to be a growing issue in the 21st century. The environmental migration literature has generally focused on the characteristics of migrants, rather
than their destinations. Where displaced persons migrate has important policy implications. For instance, global environmental change over the coming century could lead to
mass migrations (Black et al. 2011, Feng et al. 2010) and knowing the potential destinations
of future environmental migrants is paramount to understanding the total demographic
implications of a world with increasing population displacement from environmental phenomena. Knowing who and from where someone might migrate is only two-thirds of the
migration equation. This study provides an additional step toward filling the final third of
the migration equation: to where someone might migrate.
Environmental migration has been a major topic of migration scholars and demogra23

phers (Nawrotzki et al. 2015, Gray & Bilsborrow 2013, Hunter et al. 2015). Rapid-onset
environmental events, such as tropical cyclones, are typically studied to understand environmental migration (Fussell et al. 2014, Lu et al. 2016), with Hurricane Katrina garnering
tremendous attention (Stone et al. 2012, Fussell & Elliott 2009, Groen & Polivka 2010,
Curtis et al. 2015). However, many of these studies are limited to vague directional geographies such as ‘rural to urban’ (Gray & Bilsborrow 2013) or ‘to nearby cities’ (Mallick &
Vogt 2014). Vagaries such as these make it difficult for governments to predict and plan for
migration. But these studies inform our understanding of future climate-related migration
– migration that could increasingly be due to more slow-onset environmental changes such
as drought or extreme heat.
The manifestation of environmental migration is largely depend upon the type of environmental pressure (Gutmann & Field 2010). Both rapid-onset and slow-onset environmental events can produce permanent migration but only rapid-onset events are likely
to trigger evacuee migration. If our understanding of how future climate-rated migration
might unfold comes from environmental events where permanent migrants and evacuees
are analyzed together and future climate change migration is linked to slow-onset environmental change (Hunter et al. 2013, Feng et al. 2010, Call et al. 2017), then governments
responsible for managing this migration could be misinformed. While the Great East Japan
Earthquake and Tsunami did not result from climate change, our work helps clarify which
parts of a migration system are more predictable in response to an environmental event
due to separate analysis of migrants and evacuees.
We find that the migratory responses to the Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent events manifest in two separate and distinct systems: one for permanent migrants
and one for evacuees. We also find relatively little change in the spatio-temporal structure
of the migration system. The proportions and destinations of migrants were relatively
unaltered in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. These two systems, evacuation and migration, each exemplify different aspects of Findlay’s six principles. Evacuees’
migration seems to emphasize short-distance moves, while the permanent migrants seem
to follow pre-existing human and social capital connections. Although our dataset does
not include any measure of human capital, the stability of the migration system – even

24

in the face of such a catastrophic event – and prior research (eg Randell (2018)) suggests
that permanent migrants leverage human and social capital connections present in the
pre-environmental displacement migration system. Consequently, the migration system of
permanent migrants after an environmental event are likely to reflect the migration systems
exhibited prior to the event.
Evacuees on the other hand, exhibit a markedly different migration system from the
pre-existing migration system and, unlike more permanent migrants, were more likely to
migrate to nearby destinations in greater numbers. Our results suggest the differences
between permanent migrants and evacuees could be the intentionality to return. Evacuees
who suddenly had to give up their home may not be ready for distant relocation. For
evacuees who were deeply rooted in their home community, it may have been difficult to
move far away from their center of social capital and thus moved to nearby “safe” locations,
possibly with the intent to return home. Return migrants after Hurricane Katrina tended
to be from low-damage areas (Groen & Polivka 2010, Fussell et al. 2010) as well. Those
who made more permanent migrations perhaps may have less intent to return to their home
prefecture or could have come from more damaged areas in the Tohoku region.
There are some limitations to this analysis. First, the official number of evacuees is
still in continual flux, even eight years after the disaster, and is subject to administrative
problems (Ishikawa 2012). The extent to which these administrative problems have infected
the migration data is unknown. Similar issues plagued IRS data in the immediate aftermath
of Hurricane Katrina (Johnson et al. 2008), prompting skepticism around disaster-related
administrative data (Curtis et al. 2015, Groen & Polivka 2010). Additionally, while we
document nearly a 550% increase in net negative migration from Fukushima Prefecture
after the disaster, the total number of negative net migrants (-31,381 net migrants in 2011)
is approximately half of the known number of evacuees displaced outside of the prefecture
(59,494 in December 2011). How many of these evacuees have been included in the official
migration statistics is unknown, and this study examines only the universe of migrants preand post-disaster captured in the Japanese government data.
Finally, the Japanese relocation policy could have steered evacuees to short-distance
moves. Some residents voluntarily evacuated and others were compelled to evacuate and

25

those with stronger social capital had more destination options to leverage than those
with weaker social capital. Thus, the distribution of destinations for evacuees may be
dependent in part on the nature of the evacuation event – voluntary vs. involuntary decision
to migrate, voluntary vs. involuntary housing decision, etc. Those who have limited social
capital and were forced to evacuate from the irradiated zone might have tended to evacuate
to the nearest place with available housing, exhibiting different destinations from those
who involuntarily evacuated but who possessed stronger social capital. There is a distinct
possibility that our origin-destination evacuee data are selected with bias and forms of bias
that we simply cannot describe or account for in the evacuee data.
Despite these limitations, our research provides a robust examination of two concurrent migration systems and contributes to the environmental migration literature. There
is growing interest in projecting migration responses to environmental events (Curtis &
Schneider 2011, Rigaud et al. 2018, Hauer 2017, Hassani-Mahmooei & Parris 2012, Lu
et al. 2016, Davis et al. 2018), and our method, data, and results offer important empirical
grounding to further those efforts.
