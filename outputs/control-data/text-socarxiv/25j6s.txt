"5" "Abstract"
"6" "This paper  reflects on   alternatives to the traditional form of doctoral thesis  which  are emerging  to  reflect a new approach to the valuation and designation of scientific outputs .   We examine the changes  and c onsider some implications.  We suggest that t he adoption of co-citation as underpinning principle for the measurement of knowledge structures  has  led to re-designation of the value of knowledge and knowledge producers in increasingly  quantitative  terms.  We use notions of ‘institution’ and ‘logic’ to better understand s uch a change  and its implications .   Under  a  new logic   that is  gradually embedding itself across the higher education sector , the ‘constitutive rules’ concerned with the value of research now prioritize quantification, and tangibility of output, and quality is increasingly equated with citation. Whil st  the scientific disciplines have traditionally been closer to this model, albeit with significant national variations,  subjects within the  Social Sciences and Humanities are now being affected. We present evidence from a small study  of  the UK higher education sector of  university  regulation  of  doctoral degree submission format in two disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences (History and Sociology). Our evidence shows the recent and gradual adoption of a  practice, previously  more common in scientific disciplines ,  that  allows the  doctoral thesis  to  b e constituted by a series of publishable papers, known by a variety of names, the most common being ‘T hesis by  P ublished  P apers ’ , ‘J ournal  F ormat  T hesis ’, ‘Alternative Format Thesis’,  and  ‘ Integrated Thesis ’ .  As the thesis of the  S ocial  S ciences and  H umanities  – itself an important institution in the academic field -  begins  to reflect a greater emphasis upon  quantity  of knowledge outputs , a tension emerges  with  the most central of all  scientific institutions,  the peer-reviewed journal paper."

"8" "Introduction"
"9" "The award of a doctoral degree is a strong signal that the holder  of  the qualification can join the academy’s latest generation of scholars. Possession demonstrates completion of a successful attempt to make a knowledge claim and the acquisition of research skills and capabilities including much tacit knowledge of the culture of the academy. While doctoral theses produced within scientific disciplines traditionally include bodies of papers reporting scientific discovery, in the Social Sciences and Humanities in the UK higher education sector this has not been so until recently. Now, however, doctoral education is transforming with the thesis reconceived as a form of output  as it is within the scientific disciplines."
"10" "The paper  considers this transformation, and the issues which are raised by  it. We do this by  introducing  firstly  a discussion of  the  central  importance within the academic world of distinctions and differences  that underpin the activity of ensuring quality.  In the academic world, s uch distinctions apply both to  what is produced, generally termed ‘knowledge’, and the actors  that  produce it,  termed researchers , or academics  or scholars  or at another level s , research groups,  universities or countries.   The paper then moves to  review  developments in the status of the doctoral thesis   which have seen  universities changing their rules on thesis format to allow  a  submission for the doctoral degree to  comprise  an assemblage of papers, often three or four in number, each intended to be of publishable quality, and taken together forming a coherent body of work. The changes now being observed are then outlined, and are considered from two interrelated developments both of which are underpinned by  quantification .  Firstly, developments in information science to improve access to knowledge and to develop understanding of scientific knowledge generation have led to the adoption of citation as  the  pivotal organizing concept  which conceives  knowledge as  quanta ,  and the value of knowledge considered  quantitat i vely . Secondly, marketization in higher education emphasizes commodification that re-frames activity as  product ive  of  product . These changes are then reflect ed  on using concepts from  realist philosophy and  new institutionalist theor y, particularly the notion of constitutive rules, and notions of institutional development and change. Such concepts help to illuminate the tensions that exist as  knowledge claims made within  the context of one important academic institution, the  doctoral  thesis, are reframed  in relation to  another, if not the central academic instituti on, the peer-reviewed paper.  We then move to our empirical section which  reports on an investigation of  p ractice in the use of traditional and new  thesis formats in two representative disciplines of the Social Sciences (Sociology) and the Humanities (History) at British universities. The paper  concludes with a discussion  of  issues raised by the research including proposals for further  enquiry ."
"11" "Literature"
"12" "The Academy – a Place of Distinctions"
"13" "Understanding knowledge production as a system (‘metascience’  Ziman (2002) ) is a topic of long-standing and continuing interest across both the  Sciences and the  Humanities .   W ithin debates  about how such systems operate there has been much discussion of  the  way  control is exercised over the outputs of the system  and in particular  the definition of  quality.  Key contributions  in the debates about academic quality, what it is ,  and how it can be recognized ,   have been made by some of the most eminent researchers in the whole of social science, see for example the extensive contributions of  Merton (1973b)  and  Bourdieu (1988) ."
"14" "Those approaching  the  question of how the  quality and relevance  of academic work ,  and academics themselves ,  should be judged  have generally heeded the verdict of philosophers of science who have avoided the construction of explicit  and objectivist  criteria (see for example,  Feyerabend (1993)  on the diverse practices and forms of science  of defining methods ). Instead, the approaches in metascience have attended to three main questions , see for example   Merton (1973a) : a) what, in scientific  practice counts or can count as,  or be measured  as,  or considered  to exhibit  scientific quality; b)  how, in practice, does it count (in the sense of how do such distinctions arise?) ;   and c) who should make such judgements? The  second question  is the one that has  most  occupied scholars and it has been  understood and deal t  with  in two  main  ways: how should it count, i.e., normatively, or what, in practice, happens when the rules of the game are devised and or further applied. Both Bourdieu’s notion of academic capital  (Naidoo, 2004) , and Merton’s reflection on the Matthew Effect  (Merton, 1968)   have  reflect ed  this awareness  of a connection between  the question of who makes the judgement about quality ,  what criteria are in use  to make judgement s, and  then how such criteria  are subsequently  applied  and with what effect . Thus, w hile Merton and Bourdieu were concerned with what might give rise to distinctions within academic culture or the academic field (Merton’s emphasis is frequently upon the priority and novelty of the discoveries of the scientist, while Bourdieu identifies performance in the  agrégation  as one form whereby academic excellence is established), the main emphasis of their work has been upon what and how the  reputation  of those who possess it allows them to control and  exert  influence  in  the systems they inhabit ."
"15" "The  emphasis in the work of Merton and in the work of Bourdieu  therefore  has been upon the social processes which  underpin  such distinctions. Bourdieu ’s highly detailed  analysis of academic hierarchies and distinctions  has emphasised the  importance of  bod ies  of rules or the ‘rules of the game’  (Bourdieu, 1988)  which might change over time , but the approach to definition is largely a static one ."
"16" "A cross this wide range of work , there is  great  reluctance to state categorically what means should be chosen to designate excellence. Merton’s discussion  identifies many of  the subtleties  of distinction , and  is  mindful of the many difficulties of defining excellence ;  but   h is discussion covers the issue of what is prior to achievement , not in what achievement actually consists . Thus,  in his framework, he refers to potential (‘talent’) while his approach to the question of excellence  relies  ultimately upon an identity  and even a circularity : “For immediate purposes, it is enough to note that two of the meanings implied by the word excellence correspond loosely to the two meanings of recognition that have been briefly examined’  (Merton, 1973a, page 423) . For him  excellence is defined teleologically:  there is potential on the one hand, in his terms a  ‘quality’ and there is excellence in what is delivered, in his terms ,  ‘performance’."
"17" "Within the academy, t he position of the  doctoral thesis  within the  hierarchy  of academic knowledge has been little considered. Major writers on the subject of knowledge production  have  give n   little consideration to  the doctoral thesis ,  either as knowledge product or in terms of a position or status in academic hierarchy . Merton  in his major works  does not particularly consider  students , no r   does  Ziman.  The more recent  analysis  by  Whitley (2000)  of the intellectual and social organisation of the sciences does not  once  mention students as contributing  or creating scientific knowledge."
"18" "Where there has in fact been consideration of the doctoral thesis using citation-based bibliometric analysis, this has tended to treat the thesis as  sui generis  and not as part of the rest of the scientific literature.  Important studies in this area using  bibl iometric analysis of the thesis have tended to  study topic focus, see for an examination of the field of library and information studies  Sugimoto, Li, Russell, Finlay, and Ding (2011)  and more recently  Sugimoto (2014)  on academic heritages."
"19" "The valuation of the thesis as outside the normal knowledge producing process is evident also in the behaviour of citation i ndexers  which  do not consider the thesis as a type  of output , and theses are not currently included in the Web of Knowledge  (Clarivate, 2019) . Databases of theses have, though, developed as a result of initiatives taken by national bodies  (Weisser & Walker, 1997) , and some national systems are now in place to record the output of students, see for example the UK’s British Library’s system  (British Library, 2018) . The Spanish Government  (Spanish Ministry, 2018)  also maintains its own database and there is widespread recognition of the virtues of such databases for providing access to knowledge, see for example the work of  Grigas, Juzeniene, and Velickaite (2017) . Other repositories can be found around the world at university level, see for example in Israel where  Ben-Gurion University of the Nege v has its own resource inspired by the global ETD movement  (Asner & Polani, 2008) ."
"20" "A number of reflections on how to turn the thesis into a paper  (Singh, 2015; B. Thomas & Skinner, 2012)  reflect a widespread view of the thesis as of a lower standard, a corollary of which is that such work needs ‘conversion’   (B. Thomas & Skinner, 2012 page 2)  to turn it into a proper piece of academic work, but that the effort is worth making when academic staff ,  fac ing   spiralling  competitive pressures to produce , can convert theses to papers . Currently, within the UK context, the UK Research Excellence Framework (the REF) ignores the thesis entirely qua knowledge claim  (Higher Education Funding Agency for England (HEFCE)/ Research England, 2018) , although other research systems do take notice of the ses, for example the Danish one   (Wilsdon et al., 2015) ."
"21" "A New Model Thesis"
"22" "However, there have been strong arguments mounted over a long period in favour  of a thesis structured in such a way that its contents are presented as papers , and,  therefore, as a set of very  explicit knowledge claims . For an account of the origins of the thesis by published work, see  Bao, Kehm, and Ma (2018) , who note  its origins in the so-called ‘cumulative dissertation’ of the German higher education system.   Early work to establish the case for a publication based thesis is made by a number of writers  with  a leading figure  being  Rudy (1962) . Later work  in favour of the thesis  qua  contribution to knowledge  (through a published papers format) ,   and  which takes a  critical  stance  against  the traditional monograph ,  includes  most importantly  that by  Breimer and Breimer (1995, p. 175)  which  dismissively term s   the traditional format a  ‘tome-based system’ .  Other proponents of the thesis that is formed from papers include   J. R. Thomas, Nelson, and Magill (1986)  who se   use  of  the term  ‘alternative format’  begins to establish one of a number of new naming conventions although ‘publication based system’  (Breimer & Mikhailidis, 1993, p. page 406)  is a more accurate description.   Writing about the production of doctoral theses in the context of medical research,  Breimer and Mikhailidis (1993)   describe  the difference between the UK system for  a  PhD in medicine, which does not require a thesis to include papers, and the Swedish system, in which the thesis is required to be made up of papers.  The authors  however note discrepancies even within systems: they observe  that at a leading UK university, in the Faculty of Medicine (The University of Oxford), theses are  indeed  allowed to be presented as papers ."
"23" "Characteristic of the debate about the definition of the thesis  is  a paradoxical approach to the status of the thesis as knowledge claim. Thus, despite arguing for  the  superiority of the thesis by published work  through claiming it as a better test of  the  capacity of a  student  to produce knowledge of significance  (Breimer & Breimer, 1995, 1996) ,   the authors  incongruously  propose a database of theses  that, in effect, formally segregates the thesis as knowledge product from the other scientific literature ,  even when  it is the case  the papers produced within a thesis are published.  Again, to further demonstrate the difficulty  of making a decision on which format of thesis is the better,  rather than seeking  to impose a system,  the authors  rather  arg ue for   the freedom to choose  which  format  to use, although they indicate that the market will decide , and  ultimately  do so in favour of  the thesis by published papers."
"24" "The  Social Sciences  and the  Humanities"
"25" "While the d ebate over the format of the doctoral degree is long-running, and as we note above, different systems operate in different countries ,  in recent years, the arguments in favour of thesis by published papers have grown .   I n the UK  higher education system ,  where the use of the thesis by published papers is  still  limited  (Christianson, Elliott, & Massey, 2015) ,   there is now a growing  interest  with in the  Social Sciences  and  Humanities     in the adoption of that format  (Jump, 2015) .   According to  de Rosa (2016) , the interest within the  Social Sciences  and  Humanities  in the thesis by published work is the result of two influences, a change in our understanding of scientific knowledge brought about by the citation mapping revolution ,  and the new public management. We  elaborate on  these two influences briefly below."
"26" "Citation – Mapping and then Measuring – Changing Cultures of Valuation"
"27" "The  pioneering sociological investigations into the field of  scientific enquiry by Bourdieu and Merton, including into how hierarchies and distinctions formed and were reproduced,  have been  accompanied by  important developments in the technologies of information science and particularly in the area of citation indexing   to meet the ever-growing needs of researchers to locate papers relevant to their  enquiries  (De Bellis, 2009) .  T o resource such a mammoth project, Eugene Garfield established the Institute of Scientific Information (abbreviated to the ISI and the forerunner of the Web of Science / Web of Knowledge). Central to the approaches developed within the Institute of Scientific Information’s activities was the use of co-citation  (Small, 1973)  to associate publications into aggregations that could then be claimed to  show  the main structures of scientific fields and identify research fronts. Citation also provided a means of measuring the recognition / impact of papers, but also the  status of the  journals which published them, and although the idea of the journal impact factor had been developed earlier, it was in this period that it became more widely used. Th is  quantifying approach to scientific information, anticipated in 1955 by Garfield  (Garfield, 2006; Garfield E., 1955, 1972)  and then made possible through computerization of citation indexing by the work of the Institute of Scientific Information, created possibilities for the appreciation and delineation of the quantitative dimensions of scientific achievement which had been shown to exist by Lotka  (1926)  and which had been more recently noted by Shockley  (Shockley, 1957)  and by  De Solla Price (1963) ."
"28" "It is an obvious truism that the quantitative paradigm for  conceiving of  the quality of academic work has become a n increasingly   important  approach across the whole of the academy, indeed across society. Recently signs of the influence if not the popularity of the quantifying approach has been the growth of sites and services designed to assess and promote an individual’s work using citation, see for example  (Haley, 2013)  on Harzing’s site and its various uses, including as a search engine. The reception of the work of those who have created index numbers that can be applied to individual scholars and which combine in some way the counts of papers and their respective citation counts  (Egghe, 2006; Hirsch, 2005)  is also further evidence of the growth of quantitative and indicator-based measures of scientific achievement. For example, Hirsch’s paper from 2005 has now over eight thousand citations (on Google Scholar). Further attempts to refine the quantitative approach have followed.  Franceschini, Galetto, Maisano, and Mastrogiacomo (2012)  employ an approach which they term the success index, while  Waltman, Yan, and van Eck (2011)  use a field normalized recursive counting approach employing PageRank counting methods. A quantifying approach to scientific knowledge production has emerged, is widely used and is considered a credible approach, particularly across the natural and medical sciences."
"29" "A Context for Quantification"
"30" "The quantifying approach to knowledge production has developed if not flourished in a  period  that  has seen a number of reforms of public sector organisations, including significant changes within the higher education sector across the world. These changes have arisen from two contrasting and yet related attempts to revise and re-frame the relationship between universities and the outside world: a) attempts to impose notions of economic efficiency upon the sector, including upon its research functions, a set of changes that are often referred to as the New Public Management (NPM) and ;  b) attempts to engage the University more broadly with  societal concerns, a position outlined most notably by  Gibbons et al. (1994)  and in a later work  Nowotny, Scott , and Gibbons (2001)  and pursued under the notion of grand challenges by research funders such as the European Union  (Cagnin, Amanatidou, & Keenan, 2012; van Oost, Kuhlmann, Ordonez-Matamoros, & Stegmaier, 2016) . The first of these two changes has been the more significant although the second cannot be denied as having importance."
"31" "The NPM has brought to bear upon the higher education sector not only a range of mechanisms to promote competition between institutions such as performance indicators of many kinds  (Christensen, 2012; de Boer, Enders, & Schimank, 2007; Erno-Kjolhede & Hansson, 2011; Guthrie & Neumann, 2007; Hicks, 2012; Humphrey & Miller, 2012; Olssen & Peters, 2005; Vinokur, 2017; Wollmann, 2017)  with attendant criticisms of their effects  (Chandler, Barry, & Clark, 2002; Christensen, 2011, 2012; Diefenbach, 2009; Lorenz, 2012; Moosa, 2018; Rebora & Turri, 2013; Renaudie, 2018; Ryan, Connell, & Burgess, 2017; Schimank, 2005; Schubert, 2009; Shore, 2008; ter Bogt & Scapens, 2012)  but has imposed notions of commodification upon the whole area of activity in which universities engage  (McCowan, 2017; Zacharakis & Holloway, 2016) . Commodification is not as  Komljenovic and Robertson (2016)   argue a static process but a continuous and dynamic activity to which the individual institutions of the sector are subject."
"32" "Institutional Change in the Academy"
"33" "This extended  but  necessarily in complete  discussion  above  of the  doctoral  degree  - a key part of  academic  practice –   relates to  what  much realist philosophy and , following it,   institutionalist scholarship ,   refer to specifically as the  constitutive rules  of a social institution. Constitutive rules  are considered to  be essential to the creation of social reality ,  and in institutionalist scholarship  they  form part of the cultural-cognitive background, one of three  elements or ‘pillars’ (regulative, normative, cultural-cognitive)  that  jointly make  social  institution s possible .  The institutionalist view is that constitutive rules take the form of statements, ‘X counts as a Y in context C’  (Scott, 2014, page 76) , they are definitional  statements stating what is the case, not what should be the case nor why something is the case (normative statements). Nor are they an expression of a rule, or of the consequences of the breaking of a rule (regulative statements)."
"34" "Recent changes observed to the way in which the thesis  qua  social institution is defined within some of the disciplines is, we would argue, a  prima facie  example of the changing of the ‘constitutive rules’ of an institution, and, as we suggest, such a change is profound and significant.  Below we consider how  the  realist and  institutionalist  understanding of the process by which social facts and institutions are created and subsist  provides some insight into the question of how the thesis is being redefined,  and  how the  process of redefinition, which we have noted  above , is occurring and  what its implications are ."
"35" "I n the example we are considering of changes to the  rules that define a  thesis, an immediate question concerns  what  effect  occurs    when  the attempt is made to make  a  first and prior  ( social )  institution (we might term them  institutional entities  –   ‘ institutional facts ’ in earlier realist attempts to define social objects  (Searle, 1995) )   part of  the constitutive rules of  the  second  institution.  In the  instance  we  are  consider ing   of  the redefinition of the thesis , a  second  institution, which is the thesis, is being redefined as, or to lie in close relation to ,  another  social institution   which ,  here ,  is  the  central institution of the academic field, the  ‘ knowledge claim ing’   peer-reviewed ,  academic paper.  Reflecting on the way in which  the notion of constitutive rules  relates to the construction of these social institutions,  it  can  be stated  in the second institution that  papers (X) are certified knowledge claims (Y) in  a  thesis (C).  But the central institution of science , which is prior to the thesis,  has  never  been formulated with the constitutive rule  that certified knowledge claim s  (X) are papers (Y) in  a  thesis   (C).  Our view is that there can be no necessity  that a second constitutive rule binds a first constitutive rule . The creation of the second rule creates confusion for the first."
"36" "T his discussion serves to emphasize two important aspects of these developments: a) a  paper in a thesis can never be a knowledge claim by virtue of being in a thesis; it can only be a knowledge claim by virtue of being peer-reviewed ; b)  the propounding of  a  subsequent constitutive rule (e.g. that a thesis contains peer reviewed papers) with an implication for a prior constitutive rule  that  defines its terms differently is merely the expression of a wish  but which, if taken on an equal footing with the prior constitut ive  rule ,   raises the possibility of ambiguity  and confusion for  the  field in which the se  constitutive rules apply."
"37" "A  further concern relevant to  the  case  of the redefinition of the thesis is again one  with which  institutionalist  scholarship has been engaged  is how  such changes  are  brought about ?   Theorizing on the subject of change  in  the institutionalist literature identifies two contrasting processes  to explain  how  changes happen  – both of which may however be present in a ny given case . Where changes to institutions – in this case the definition of the thesis – proceed on an uncertain basis with a general open-ended approach, and where, as Scott indicates, outcomes ‘emerge from the collective sense-making and problem solving behaviour of actors confronting similar situations’  (Scott, 2014, p. 114) , a naturalistic account is plausible. Where institutional change is led by specific agents, the term  ‘ agent-based change ’  is employed."
"38" "Our reading of the case of the redefinition of the thesis in light of the institutionalist scholarship therefore raises questions about relations between different institutions when their  respective constitutive rules overlap i.e. have common reference points, and also questions about how such changes occur. Our view is that such topics invite a more detailed investigation .   A t this stage, it is appropriate to conduct, as we have done, a short exploratory investigation of actual practice of thesis  formats , to document change s  to the rules regarding format ,  and to  explore  the  extent  of new practices , and relate changes to known features of the  organisations a nd institutions of academe, such as their size, and performance."
"39" "E xploring Changes in Practice: An Investigation"
"40" "The agenda for empirical work  was  therefore twofold:   a) documenting practice and intention; and b)   identifying differences  between disciplines, which a previous study  on the general topic  had not  examined  in any detail  (Christianson et al., 2015) ,  and  exploring  how differences in practice and intention might have arisen.  To provide empirical evidence about changes in practice in terms of thesis submission format adoption, a short exploratory study  was conducted to  record  the use of theses by publication in universities in the United Kingdom in two disciplines in the  Social Sciences  and  Humanities , Social Science  and History ."
"41" "Evidence potentially relevant to explaining departmental practice was obtained from the REF2014 database . This database  contains information at unit of assessment level (quasi departmental information) about the size of departments and various performance measures including the quality of academic outputs [‘the output measures’], the research culture  [‘the research environment’] and the impact of the research upon society and the economy [‘impact’], and the composite measure reflecting the amount of resource available to the unit of assessment on the basis of the entire REF submission  in that unit of assessment  (at REF2014).  Our expectation was that departmental size might infl uence adoption of new practices, following the view that the more communication channels through which information about an innovation could pass, the  higher  the diffusion rate  Rogers (2003) , although we note the relationship between size and performance is problematic and that above a certain size threshold, performance might decline  (Kenna & B.Berche, 2011) .   A further but weak expectation was that departments with a higher proportion  of staff  producing work regarded as of higher  overall quality  would be different from those at the other extreme - and would  furthermore,  have adopted the new style - i.e. thesis  by published papers , on the assumption that  if flexibility on thesis format is advantageous to an organisation, it will occur more frequently in those which, on some yardstick of performance measurement, have fared better."
"42" "As d isciplinary cultures vary significantly,  in regard to citation amongst other aspects  (Ziman, 2002, p. 260) ,  it could be reasonably  expect ed   that  difference s  between sociology and history  would exist in thesis format : in particular, one might expect to see more thes e s by publication in departments where the use of 'theory' is more common, i.e. in  S ociology, than in departments where narrative exposition  and extended analysis  is more common, i.e.  H istory. For that reason, our approach was to consider the two disciplines separately."
"43" "Our sample included a number of newer universities and  a number of  very well-established ones. We sought to investigate whether Russell or non-Russell Group universities were different in their use of t he thesis by published papers as Russell Group universities have advantages of size, stronger research tradition and, through being often older, more experienced staff."
"44" "Method ology"
"45" "Selection of Cases and Sources of Data"
"46" "We wrote to or phoned departments or quasi departments in 21 educational institutions where there had been  a  return in the unit of assessment ‘ S ociology’ in the last Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise of 2014.  We also wrote to or phoned 40 education institutions where there had been a return in the unit of  assessment ‘ H istory’.  We selected institutions randomly. From 29 institutions submitting in the unit of assessment  S ociology we sought replies from 21 ,  while from the 83 institutions submitting in the unit of assessment history, we sought replies from 40 institutions."
"47" "While the REF data applies to units of assessment, our study  attempted to obtain  responses from academic departments / divisions or schools. We recognize that our study relates data from responses given to a questionnaire about practice in 2019 to data from 2014 (published in 2014) .   T he relevance of what could be regarded as contemporary data  about practice to historical data  could be questioned , and we accept that previous performance might no longer  be strongly associated with and relate to current  departmental  practice."
"48" "Ethics  Review  Statement"
"49" "An ethical review manager  (ERM) software  tool  provided by  our  u niversity  was used to assess  the study’s requirement for formal review by either the Proportionate Ethical Review committee or  any of the  university standing ethics committees.  The tool indicated that the study would not require formal ethical review  as no personal data was being collected."
"50" "Research Focus and Questionnaire"
"51" "We noted in our enquiry ,  which was carried out by email and by telephone survey ,  that i n some institutions, the term journal format thesis  wa s used instead of thesis by published papers format .  But we also drew attention to the fact that our enquiry sought information only about the thesis format that was an alternative to  the  traditional doctoral monograph thesis and not the  form of thesis  which is  intended for later career staff who might wish to earn a doctoral degree from work published over a long (sometimes a career-long) period  which is in many institutions termed a ‘thesis by published work’.  Our reason for excluding this second form of thesis involving publications was that in cases where academic staff are submitting papers for the degree of doctor of philosophy, they are doing so with papers that are often  already published , and this activity is not the major form of production of doctoral theses.  Our study aims by contrast  to examine   the issue  of whether and how the alternative to the traditional monograph thesis is transforming to one comprised of papers of publishable quality and which are intended to constitute knowledge claims , and what other factors might be associated with such changes in practice."
"52" "In each case we aimed to contact administrators or academic staff with knowledge of the history of  submission format practice   who could answer the following questions:"
"53" "Table  1  Questionnaire"
"54" "1. Are doctoral theses in your discipline at your institution permitted to be either of the monograph format or published papers format or of the monograph format only? Both    ☐    Monograph    ☐    Don ’ t Know    ☐"
"55" "2. Which format was the more common form submitted in the last year/academic session ending in July 2018 in your discipline at your institution?  Monograph  ☐      Published Papers  ☐       Don ’ t Know  ☐"
"56" "3. When was doctoral degree submission in the published papers format first allowed in your discipline at your institution?  Year  ☐    Academic Session _________   Don ’ t Know  ☐"
"57" "4. If your discipline at your institution does not currently permit the submission of a doctoral thesis in published papers format, is the intention of your discipline in your institution likely to change to allow it?  Yes  ☐     No    ☐    Don’t Know    ☐"
"58" "5. If your answer is Yes to question 4, by which year will the change be made?  Year/Academic Session _______    Don’t Know"

"61" "For the discipline of S ociology, all  21  departments  we wrote to  replied.  33 replies were received from  40 H istory departments .  Our coverage of the sector was therefore ,  in Sociology, 21 from  29 submitting in the last REF (72%)  and in History ,  33  responses  from 83  submitting in the last REF (40%) ."
"62" "Data was analysed in order to establish the following:"
"63" "In how many institutions  has  thesis submission  been  allowed in both monograph  and journal format,  and  the current level of usage of the different formats, and current in tentions ."
"64" "Evidence of  changes recently in the adoption of  Thesis by Published Papers ."
"65" "The existence of  statistically significant differen ces  between disciplines  in respect of the acceptance of monograph and  Thesis by Published Papers  format ."
"66" "The existence of different  levels of submission in the two formats , and the presence of  differences between  disciplines ."
"67" "If published papers are allowed in a particular discipline at a certain institution ,  when did change s   occur  and are  there difference s  between subject disciplines?"
"68" "For those institutions yet to adopt the practice of thesis submission in published papers format, what were current intentions?"
"69" "If intentions were to introduce a thesis in published papers format, when would this be allowed? Were there differences between subject fields?"
"70" "Transformation of Practice  – Current Rules, Practice, Intention"
"71" "Amongst sociology departments,  eight  out of 21 now allow the submission of both a monograph thesis and thesis by published papers with  five  departments allowing the practice since 200 1 . Amongst history departments, 15 out of  33  departments now allow both formats with  eight  departments  starting  to  allow the practice since 20 0 1 .  In our sample of departments, there is no statistically significant difference in practice between the  uses  of the two formats between disciplines.  The Fisher  e xact  t est statistic value is 0.7784  for the comparison of allowed practice by discipline. In terms of usage, the monograph is more common in both disciplines. Only in  one  department is the Thesis by Published Papers more common than the Monograph. This occurs in Sociology."

"99" "As to intentions to  allow  both the monograph and the thesis by published papers, no sociology departments in our study indicated that they were planning to introduce rules to permit students to submit theses in both formats currently, although one department replied that intentions were not known.  Four  history departments indicated that they were planning to permit both formats with two further departments of history indicating that their future plans were not known at the time of our request for information from them. Of those History departments intending to introduce both formats  two  were intending to introduce them in 2019 and  two  in 2020."
"100" "Below we note the  introduction  of TBPP and the number of departments adopting. In Sociology it is possible to see that  in total ,   five  departments have  either  adopted the TBPP  or  have plans to introduce TBPP  since 2001, which is 17% of all departments , while in  History  12   twelve  departments have adopted  since 2001  or plan soon to adopt , which is 1 4 %."

In Sociology, there were 8 Russell Group universities in the sample  of 21  (38%) ,  and in History, there were 13 Russell Group universities (33%)  from a sample of 33 .  We used Fisher’s e xact  t est to establish if there were differences  in practice  at the level of the whole sample of both disciplines  (N=54) between Russell Group departments and non-Russell Group departments, and also within subject disciplines (Sociology, N=21; History, N=33).

"155" "Exploring the  Influence  of the University  upon Departmental Practice"
"156" "When random samples of departments were chosen from both disciplines, a small number [N=8] were located in the same education institution. It was therefore possible to  look for the effect  of  an ‘organisational effect’  on those universities that had departments in  our sample in  both  disciplines . One of t he departments in the group of eight  did not however reply to the question and was removed. In the event ,   seven  departments were examined and in  three  cases, there was departmental agreement, while in  four  cases, departments in the same institution operated different practices in regard to thesis submission format. A binomial test can be made and a null hypothesis of no influence can be tested. In the event of there being  seven  cases with  four  non-matches, the probability of  four  or more non-matches has a probability of 0.5, and a 95% confidence interval of 0.18 to 0.90, showing that the null hypothesis of no-influence cannot be rejected."

"205" "Our analysis of the adoption of thesis by published papers as a distinct practice examined the role of the size of departments upon adoption. New practices may be more likely to  arise where departments have more contact with the outside world. A crude indicator of a department’s exposure to outside influences would be its size in terms of the number of staff. While the number of staff submitted in the REF2014, which is the information we have used, is not necessarily a reliable guide to the number of actual members of staff in a department, for the purposes of this enquiry it might  be a relevant indicator as those counted are the department’s active researchers with, potentially the stronger external contacts.  A ranks test was  used  t o assess th e association between the adoption of the TBPP and departmental size.  The analysis showed that in the case of  S ociology, there was a statistically significant difference with larger departments more likely to adopt the TBPP. History departments showed no effect of size upon adoption of the practice."

"259" "We used a number of pieces of information from the  Research Excellence Framework 2014   [‘ REF2014 ’]  to explore the relationship between the performance of the department in the last  major formal evaluation  and  thesis submission practices .  Such measures of quality  as produced by  the REF panels  might be considered to be  judgements taken at a particular moment in time  and are therefore not  necessarily  valid for long periods  and cannot be compared with data generated five years later . Our view is that judgements formed by the REF panels relate to departmental performance over a long period and, to that extent, are valid as assessments of departmental capability and achievement in a number of areas."
"260" "We used  the  publicly available data from the last  REF (REF2014) on the three main measures of departmental (Unit of Assessment) quality. These measures were of impact, environment and output. To assess the relationship between the financial resources ‘earned’ by the department (UOA) and  the practice of thesis adoption we re-created  four measures which combined together  formed  an  indicator in terms of FTE of the quality of research the ‘ 'quality-related research (QR) funding' ]  (UK Research and Innovation, 2019) . We used the weighting s   applied at the last REF to create indicators of departmental performance in the areas of impact, environment and output, and the composite indicator reflecting the overall amount of QR money that a department notionally earns from its submission. The indicator was created as shown below."
"261" "Imp = ((FTE x Imp4 /100 x 4)) + ((FTE x Imp3/100) x 1)"
"262" "Env = ((FTE x Env4 /100 x 4)) + ((FTE x Env3/100) x 1)"
"263" "Out = ((FTE x Out4 /100 x 4)) + ((FTE x Out3/100) x 1)"
"264" "Grand Total = (Imp x .2) + (Env x .15) + (Out x .65)"
"265" "UOA_Total_Financial_Resource_REF2014  (Per department) = Grand Total x Weighting Factor  (Inner London Weightings)"
"266" "Departments were then assessed on these four measures  of performance  and those operating both forms of thesis were compared with those operating only the monograph.  A ranks test was used on each discipline. The results of the tests are shown below in   Table  8   Performance Based Measures Comparison of Departments - Sociology  and  Table  9   Performance Based Measures Comparison of Departments - History ."
"267" "In Sociology,  three of these QR based measures of performance  were statistically significant ly  related to thesis practice. The measures  related to the  overall research quality of the department, the  measure of the department’s research culture, and the  measure  of the department’s quality of research were all significantly higher amongst the departments that had adopted the thesis  than those who had not. The measure  focusing on the  impact  of research  was not significant. In the field of History, no   measure of performance  was significantly related to the adoption of the thesis. The measure of performance assessing the impact of research was, however, close to significant.  Our interpretation of the results is that in  Sociology, there is an association between the performance of the department, in certain aspects, and thesis practice. In History, there is no association."

"396" "Discussion"
"397" "Change in Practice and Regulation"
"398" "Our  study provides the evidence from a systematic  investigation  of  changes in  the  practice s   regarding thesis submission in both Sociology and History departments in the UK Higher Education sector.  The study has used a number of non-parametric statistics as the incidence of cases / data points in our sample is low.  As yet however, we can only note changes in the rules that apply to format of thesis submission, rather than to the actual incidence of usage of different formats  since  there is no publicly available information , and initial enquiries  made  by the study suggested that  few if any  organisational records were kept."
"399" "In both disciplines, more departments  still permit thesis submission in  the monograph  format  exclusively :  in Sociology 13  departments  require the monograph  as compared with  eight  departments  where  both formats  are allowed;  while in History , 18 departments require the monograph  exclusively , compared with 15 departments that allow both formats.   Despite changes to the rules affecting practice, it is only in one department that the thesis by published papers is more common than the monograph. Change  however  is  occurring  to the rules affecting thesis submission but not  rapidly ."
"400" "Factors Affecting Change"
"401" "Our view was that some factors associated with the adoption of innovations might be investigated to identify a link with the  requirements to  use different thesis types. We considered departmental size , the organisation to which the department belonged, and a small number of measures of performance of the department (obtained from the REF2014) as potentially  relating to thesis adoption."
"402" "Departmental Size"
"403" "Departmental size, for which a proxy is available as an FTE measure in the REF2014 is  a simple but readily available measure  that is plausibly related to the scope for the adoption of new practices.  I n Sociology, size  of department  is  related to adoption of the thesis by published papers, whereas in History, size has no effect.  In departments of Sociology, the mean rank of departments that adopt both forms of thesis – i.e. that have adopted the thesis by published papers  -  is nearly twice that of departments that have not adopted. The difference is statistically significant  in the case of Sociology ."
"404" "Organisational Effect"
"405" "We were able to consider if the university in which the department was located had any effect upon the adoption of the thesis by published papers. In our sample of universities there  was a small number [N=7] where  departments of both  Sociology and History had returned in the last REF and it was therefore possible for us to examine if the organisation in which the department (the Unit of Assessment) was located had an influence upon  the  types  of thesis allowed.   As we have noted above,  four  universities had differences in their thesis submission practice between their departments of Sociology and History, while  three  universities had the same practice in both disciplines. With such a small number of cases, it is not possible to be confident that university wide policy  has had any effect – although we do note that  there was more difference than there  was  similarity in thesis formats allowed. We tentatively suggest therefore that the organisations in which departments are located are not having a strong effect upon thesis format policy."
"406" "Departmental Performance"
"407" "Our investigation also examined departmental performance along a number of dimensions and its association with thesis format type s allowed . Our evidence suggested that in the discipline of Sociology, departments that are more successful using our metric of QR money earned overall ,  and in terms of environment ,  and output were more likely to allow both types of thesis. In the discipline of History ,  there was no association between success measured using our metric and thesis adoption practice."
"408" "We had assumed that in departments that were more likely to achieve higher performance levels when judged by outside observers, there might be considered to be more alignment with notions of disciplinary good practice, including those relating to the adoption of new forms of thesis. This might be most evident when comparing departments on the  Environment  measure of  performance .  Our grounds for considering this  are  that  HEFCE guidance on the way in which panels assess environment refers directly to the supervision of research students  in Section C4: Assessment criteria, Paragraph 107, Section 3 subsection ii)    (Higher Education Funding Agency for England (HEFCE)/ Research England, 2012) ."
"409" "As we note above, in departments of Sociology such a link is evident but in departments of History, the link is not present. We might consider  on the basis of this evidence that good practice in Sociology departments may be to use both forms of thesis, whereas in History, there is no consensus. This contention should though be considered in light of the fact that in Sociology, the thesis by published  papers  is less established  (in our sample) at 38% of the cases, compared with History, where 15 departments (45% of our sample) have allow ed  both forms of thesis."
"410" "Conclusions"
"411" "We note  on the basis of our study of the UK  that  important changes to the  institution ,  as we term it, of the doctoral thesis  are occurring . But the c hange s we have observed may not be complete and, missing from our picture of practice is the number of theses which are produced in different formats  in departments .  The change we  have evidence of  appears to be piecemeal, and is, in our view, suggestive of a m ore   naturalistic   form of institutional change  than one, and here o ur limited evidence on the role of universities qua organisations  is also suggestive,  which  is  actor-led ."
"412" "Our theoretical discussion noted that changes to the definition of the thesis concerned two  central  institutions  within the academic field , the  doctoral  thesis and the academic paper  that have historically served different purposes, but which, today, are being brought, for various reasons, into a closer alignment.   In the past, in the UK system, while the thesis has indeed been a knowledge claim clearly vital to the progression of the student forwards from the position of scholar to  academic  staff  member , it s knowledge claims have  not necessarily  been considered  of sufficient strength or in an appropriate form  to be considered suitable for incorporation into the formal bodies of codified knowledge. A  cordon sanitaire  had remained around the thesis, with the thesis remaining proof of a capacity to generate knowledge, and a claim of  credentialization  of the individual but not  certification  of the knowledge claim or claims made  inside the thesis .  Whether the two institutions can have a closer identity as some current practices envisage is very open to debate, and should be the object of further research."
"413" "A  number of other  questions  are raised by the alignment of these two institutions:   how should knowledge claims made within papers that comprise a thesis be linked to and indexed in the formal bodies of codified knowledge? Will the link be made from the  thesis to its cited papers or from the papers themselves that comprise the thesis to those papers that are cited? If both routes are chosen,  duplication  will surely result.   In the examination of the thesis, who now holds sway in passing the judgement of quality of a thesis by published papers,  an examiner or the  various  peer-reviewers of the papers submitted  within the thesis?   What will be the quality of papers that are produced within a thesis by published papers? Will such papers be widely accepted within formal evaluative processes such as the Research Excellence Framework?
