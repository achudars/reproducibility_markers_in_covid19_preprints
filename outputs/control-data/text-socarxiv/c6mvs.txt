Introduction
Although only a small fraction of all scientific publications is retracted for misconduct, it has
a profound impact on the research community, policy makers and the public at large. Indeed,
over the last decades scientific integrity became a hot issue in science policy (Tchao, 2014).
Moreover, papers retracted for fraud or other reasons should not be cited or used anymore.
Although in most cases they are earmarked as retracted in bibliographic databases and in the
electronic version of journals, they often remain cited a long time after the retraction notice is
published. The misconduct case of Jan Hendrik Schön is a well know example. It attracted a
lot of attention due to the renown of the researcher’s institute, the claims and the sheer
number of publications involved. This researcher co-authored more than 100 papers and rose
through prominence at the turn of the century with a number of apparent ground breaking
discoveries in materials science (Reich, 2009).
In September 2002, an investigation commissioned by Bell Labs (Beasley et al., 2002), his
employer, concluded that 17 papers contained manipulation and misrepresentation of data.
They were retracted along with an additional 14 papers based on them (Table 1). For all these
publications the retraction notices were collected. The retracted work was published in top
journals such as Science (8 papers), Nature (7 papers), Physical Review B (5 papers) and
Applied Physics Letters (4).

Other papers raised suspicion among the co-authors and the scientific community. Indeed, the
former expressed concerns about the data in several non-retracted papers (Bao, 2003).

Subsequently, after a long legal battle, Schön’s alma mater the University of Koblenz revoked
his PhD degree due to "dishonorable conduct".
Notwithstanding all the rumors provoked by this scandal in the physics community, the
retracted papers remained cited even several years after they were removed from the body of
literature. As shown in Figure 1, within the journals included in the Web of Science (WoS),
an international bibliographic database owned by Clarivate Analytics, between 2004 and 2016
the retracted papers received around 50 citations annually. This is roughly the same number of
citations that is received annually by the larger set of non-retracted papers. As in the rest of
this study, the Schön-Schön self-citations (Schön citing work he co-authored) are not counted.
Figure 1. Number of citations per year received in the WoS by retracted and non-retracted publications coauthored by Schön.

To get insight in the role of citations to Schön’s oeuvre in citing publications, natural
language processing techniques on publications’ full text are used. The main questions are: to
what extent, in what sections in the citing publications and in what context are papers coauthored by Schön cited. We make a distinction between retracted and non-retracted papers
and between the citations that papers receive before and after the results of the fraud
investigation became publicly available.
Methodology and data
Our analysis is based on a database that we constructed of the full text of publications citing
Schön’s oeuvre and that are published in Elsevier journals. The data collection is limited to
publications in Elsevier journals because for the full text analysis a machine readable version
of the publications is required. Elsevier provided CWTS access to the journal papers in such a
format. To collect the full text data, Elsevier’s Science Direct Article Retrieval API is used.
Publications that cite at least one of the papers co-authored by Schön and that are published
between 1998 and 2016 are taken into account. The full text of these publications is
downloaded in the XML format. Special-purpose software was developed to identify within
the full text of each citing publication the exact position of the citations to Schön’s work,
further called in-text citations. In addition, the software automatically extracts:
 The title of the section in which each in-text citation is mentioned; and
 The sentence containing the in-text citation as well as the sentence before and after it.

STI Conference 2018 ꞏ Leiden
A large majority of the publications in Elsevier journals are not structured along the IMRaD
model (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). The titles of the sections containing
the in-text citations were manually standardized in four categories: ‘Introduction’, ‘Body of
the text’, ‘Conclusions’, and ‘Null’, where the latter applies to letters not using section titles.
The impact of the misconduct review report (Beasley et al., 2002) and the subsequent
retraction notices published in 2002 and early 2003 is studied by comparing the distribution
over the standardized sections of in-text citations referring to retracted papers and in-text
citations referring to non-retracted papers. A distinction is made between two periods:
 The pre-retraction period: period from 1998 (first publication year for which we have
full text publications data available) until and including 2004; and
 The post-retraction period: period from 2005 until and including 2016.
To delimit the pre- and post-retraction period, 2004 was chosen to take the publication delay
of the citing publications into account. As the last retraction notices were published in 2003,
2004 is chosen as the year to delimit the two periods to take the publication delay into
account. The sensitivity of the results on this choice was tested. These distributions are also
compared with the distribution of in-text citations in a set of almost 5 million publications
(Boyack et al., 2018). To correct for possible changes over time, we included only in-text
citations that refer to publications published between 1994 and 2002, the period Schön’s
papers were published. To count the in-text citations, 2004 again is used as a citing
publication year to delimit the pre- and post-retraction period.
Finally, the precise mention of each in-text citation was manually identified and classified by
analyzing the sentences around them and where necessary the full section or paper. For the
classification of the mentions, the category ‘Retracted/fraud’ was added to the scheme
proposed by Bar-Ilan and Halevi (2017):
 Neutral: the retracted publication is mentioned as a publication that appears in the
literature without a judgment on its validity;
 Positive: the retracted publication is cited as legitimate work and used to corroborate
the authors’ current research;
 Negative: the retracted publication is mentioned as such and its findings as
inappropriate and/or questionable; and
 Retracted/fraud: the word ‘retraction’ or ‘fraud’ is mentioned in the citing publication.
To make the classification as robust as possible, the four-eyes principle was used for
assigning the in-text citations. As for the in-text citations, this classification is made for the
different sections and for the two periods. As the number of in-text citations in the concluding
section is rather small, they are amalgamated with those in the body of the text under the
heading ‘Non-introduction’ section.
Results
In the WoS, 30 articles co-authored by Schön can be found that are labelled as retracted.
These articles are published between 1998 and 2002 (Table 1, see above). It turns out that one
article is actually a correction and that it is not retracted. For the consistency of the analysis,
the WoS labelling is maintained. Of these 30 articles, 21 are cited in Elsevier journals.
Between 1994 and 2002, Schön co-authored also 70 articles and 1 letter indexed in the WoS
that are not retracted. 49 of these papers are cited in Elsevier journals. As the publications in
Elsevier journals represent only about 22% of the total number of publications included in the
WoS (Boyack, et al., 2018), the number of citations Schön’s work receives in Elsevier
journals is considerable lower than in the WoS. For example, for the retracted articles

1027

STI Conference 2018 ꞏ Leiden
published in 2000 and 2001 the number of WoS citations till 2016 is 1876 with 345 (18.4%)
in Elsevier journals. For the non-retracted papers published in these two years the numbers are
569 and 84 (14.7%). Each cited paper can be mentioned more than once in the full text:
retracted articles published in 2000 and 2001 are mentioned 490 times in Elsevier journals;
for the not retracted paper this number is 125.
As the retracted papers co-authored by Schön are cited long after their retraction and even
today, the full text analysis makes it possible to detect changes over time in the distribution of
in-text citations. Given the relative low number of (in-text) citations it was opted to use the
above mentioned two periods.

As shown in Table 2, for the two periods the distribution of the in-text citations referring to
the non-retracted papers over the introduction and the other sections combined is very similar.
In the pre-retraction period, the number of in-text citations to the retracted papers in the
introduction section is about 10% higher compared to the non-retracted papers. But in the
post-retraction period, in-text citations to the retracted papers are more strongly concentrated
in the introductory section: 74% versus 46% for the non-retracted papers.

pre-retraction period (1998-2004) and post-retraction period (2005-2016) and in the Introduction and NonIntroduction section. The in-text citations refer to papers published between 1994 and 2002.

Combining the results of Tables 2 and 3, the most striking observation is the strong
concentration of the in-text citations in the introduction section referring to retracted papers
compared to the full Elsevier dataset, especially in the post-retraction period.
To check the influence on the results of the choice of 2004 as reference year to delimit the
pre- and post-retraction period, a sensitivity test was done: using 2003 and 2005 as reference
year resulted in marginal changes of around 1%.

Table 4 shows that the in-text citations to retracted and non-retracted papers are not only
primarily concentrated in the introduction, but that their precise mention is mostly neutral.
This could be expected, as in this section authors generally present an overview of earlier
work used in their own research. In the other sections combined, 68% of the mentions of the
retracted work is also neutral and 14% indicates that the article is retracted and/or earmarked
as fraudulent. This pattern is in sharp contrast with the in-text citations to non-retracted work
where even in the pre-retraction period a large majority of the mentions is positive and
remains positive in the post-retraction period.
Discussion
The fact that fraudulent results remain cited after the publications have been retracted, is a
reason of concern not only for the research community, but also for the public at large.
Confidence in the creation of scientific knowledge could be eroded and in the case of medical
research, public health in general could be at stake (e.g., consider the case of Dutch
cardiovascular researcher and medical doctor Poldermans; Erasmus MC Follow-up
Investigation Committee, 2012).
To understand the use of retracted work in later research one has to go beyond citation
counting and analyze the distribution of the in-text citations and their precise mention. The
increased availability of the full text of publications in machine readable format and the
progress in natural language processing makes it possible to largely automate the underlying
processes.
This approach is illustrated by the study of Schön’s oeuvre. The retracted papers co-authored
by Schön remain cited even 15 years after the retraction notices were published at the same
annual rate as the much larger set of his non-retracted papers. In contrast to the neutral
mentions of both the retracted and the non-retracted work in the introduction of publications
in Elsevier journals, there is a large difference in the precise way in which Schön’s work is
cited in the other sections of scientific publications. In the case of the retracted publications,
in more than 60% of the cases the citing authors just indicate that the papers co-authored by

1029

STI Conference 2018 ꞏ Leiden
Schön exist. In the case of the non-retracted publications, however, a large majority of the
citing authors is confirming the results presented in the papers co-authored by Schön. This
could indicate that even before retraction researchers could not replicate the results or were
somewhat suspicious about the reported outcomes without openly stating this. However,
before and after retraction in the non-introductory sections, around 20% of the mentions to
retracted work are positive. A majority are in publications not reporting on experimental work
but on theoretical models using the parameters Schön claimed to have measured, such as the
temperature at which superconductivity was observed. In fabricating his data, Schön cleverly
made estimated guesses about phenomena outside the boundaries of previous work that at
first view were spectacular but not that unrealistic at all. In some cases, his ‘experimental
data’ fitted reasonably well with existing theoretical models. Other out of the blue claims
could later be corroborated by genuine experimental work.
Our next efforts will be focused on getting a better insight in various other aspects of this
case. We are working on partitioning the in-text citations in classes: a retracted Schön paper
cited individually or in a cluster together with two or more papers from other authors. Another
venue for further work is enriching the full text dataset with journals from other publishers.
Work has already been done on the much smaller PLOS dataset that is publicly available
(Bertin et al., 2016).
