Abstract
Analyzing racial distribution and its temporal change in American urban areas is an active area of research. Most
attention focused on assessing levels of racial segregation at the spatial scale of a metropolitan area. In this paper,
we present an analysis of 1990-2010 changes to racial diversity and segregation on a much smaller spatial scale of
an urban census tract. To access time-standardized racial information at the tract and at the census block scales we
use multiyear compatible high-resolution population grids. Indices of racial diversity and segregation are calculated
for over 30,000 tracts pooled from 41 metropolitan areas. Statistical analysis of this dataset reveals that during the
1990-2010 period urban tracts increased their diversity in line with diversity increases of entire metro areas, but unlike
metros, they also increased their levels of segregation. We hypothesize that an increased tendency for the residences
of people of the same race to spatially aggregate on the tract scale is the result of individuals exercising preferences
regarding their neighbors in reaction to the nationwide increase in diversity of the American population. The study
also re-derives diversity and segregation indices from the first principles of the information theory, highlights the need
to think about the issue of racial diversity/segregation in terms of spatial patterns, and uses one-person-per-dot maps
to connect diversity/segregation indices to actual racial patterns.

1. Introduction
In the United States, the urban population consists of
multiple races and ethnicities. This is the result of the
continuing immigration of different ethnoracial groups
into the U.S. A notion of a melting pot – a metaphor for
a fusion of nationalities, ethnicities, and cultures – is a
part of the American ethos. One check on the validity of
the melting pot metaphor is to analyze temporal changes
to residential multiracial diversity and segregation using
data published by the U.S. Census Bureau. There are already numerous studies reporting on the results of such
analyzes (Iceland et al., 2002; Fischer, 2003; Fischer
et al., 2004; Fasenfest et al., 2004; Farrell, 2008; Farrell and Lee, 2011; Parisi et al., 2011; Holloway et al.,
2012; Wright et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Fowler et al.,
2016; Ellis et al., 2018; Bellman et al., 2018).
In these studies, the predominant method of assessing racial diversity and segregation was to calculate

the Theil’s entropy and information theory index (Theil
and Finizza, 1971; Theil, 1972; Reardon and Firebaugh,
2002) for metropolitan areas divided mostly into their
constituent census tracts. Notable exceptions are the
works of Holloway et al. (2012) and Wright et al. (2014)
who used a diversity-dominant race classification of
census tracts for their analysis. Comparing such assessments from two different censuses yielded an assessment of changes to racial diversity and segregation on
the spatial scale of a metropolitan area. In contrast, our
primary interest in this paper is in changes to racial diversity and segregation on the spatial scale of an individual census tract. The paper has also two secondary
goals pertaining to a methodology of quantifying racial
diversity and segregation and to visualization of such
quantification.
We start by pointing out that it is conceptually advantageous to think about an urban racial fabric in terms
of a spatial pattern formed by individual inhabitants.

racial patterns.
Our second ancillary goal is a derivation of indices
characterizing a racial pattern from the first principles of
the Information Theory (IT). The IT, as originally formulated by Shannon (1948) was a theory of communication, but presently, the IT is also broadly used to quantify complexity and uncertainty. Given that racial patterns display complexity (see Fig. 1), and given the uncertainty in population data introduced by census areal
aggregation, the IT is an ideal methodology to quantify racial pattern. In Section 2, we use fundamental
concepts of the IT to frame the problem of quantifying
racial patterns in terms of analyzing a joint probability
distribution of race and location for the tract’s inhabitants. This leads to a derivation of two indices – the
entropy of the race variable (which assesses diversity)
and the mutual information between the race and location variables (which assesses segregation). Derived indices turn out to be similar to the Theil’s entropy and the
Theil’s information theory index commonly used in the
racial segregation literature. We discuss discrepancies
between the mutual information index and the Theil’s
information theory index and argue that the mutual information index is better suited to assess a level of racial
segregation.
Finally, our main goal is to calculate 1990 and 2010
values of diversity and segregation indices for every one
of over 30,000 tracts in 41 major metropolitan areas and
statistically analyze 1990-2010 changes to these values. Our most important finding is that, statistically, the

Chicago. The racial patterns within a single tract located
in the Cook County are also shown. These patterns
were obtained using a cartographic method of racial dot
maps (Roth, 2010) applied to high-resolution population grids (Dmowska et al., 2017). Each inhabitant of
Cook County is depicted as a dot having a color corresponding to his race and placed in the best estimation
of the location of his residence. Racial patterns provide
an excellent visual tool. In racial patterns, gross shares
of dots with different colors illustrate racial diversity.
By visually analyzing the two maps it is clear that the
diversity of the Cook County increased from 1990 to
2010 (a gross share of yellow dots decreased while gross
shares of purple and red dots increased). The mixing of
dots having different colors illustrates racial integration.
Less mixing is observed in the 1990 map whereas more
mixing is observed in the 2010 map indicating increasing racial integration (decreasing racial segregation) at
the level of the entire Cook County.
We submit that to appreciate numerical assessments
of changes in racial diversity and segregation, they need
to be linked to corresponding racial patterns. Without
such visuals, the change information cannot be connected to the “on the ground” reality. Thus, we developed a comprehensive set of exemplar patterns corresponding to all feasible types of racial patterns on the
spatial scale of a census tract. This helps to translate
racial change expressed in terms of numerical differences between indices calculated at different years into
change expressed in terms of time modification of actual
2

racial integration of urban tracts has decreased during
the 1990-2010 period, even while their racial diversity
has statistically increased. An analogous analysis at the
county scale shows that, statistically, the racial integration of counties has not changed during the same period,
while their racial diversity changed at the same rate as at
the tract’s scale. Thus, the melting pot hypothesis seems
to break down on the smallest scale of individual neighborhoods. We provide a broadly-sketched hypothesis of
social drivers that may explain these findings.

are randomly placed within a tract and assigned colors
in accordance with p(X). Tract-level data carries information about compositional complexity of tract’s population but carries no information about its spatial complexity. Thus, an index that describes a tract’s compositional complexity can be based only on p(X). Such
index is an entropy of p(X) denoted by H(X),
H(X) = −

K

p(X = ci ) log2 p(X = ci ),

(1)

i=1

where ci , i = 1, . . . K are the labels of K racial groups
present in the tract, and p(X = ci ) is a probability of
a random person to belong to a racial group ci (also a
relative share of ci subpopulation). Note that, in accordance with the IT convention, we use a symbol H to
denote entropy and log2 to calculate it. H(X) is best interpreted as a similarity between the actual histogram of
races in the tract p(X) and the uniform histogram u(X)
(each race has an equal share which represents an ultimate diversity). Such interpretation follows from algebraic transformations resulting in expressing H(X) in
terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence d(p, u)
(Chodrow, 2017a),

2. Method: The Information Theory Approach
Consider a hypothetical tract (Fig. 2) populated by
240 people of four different races (denoted by letters W,
B, H, and A) and subdivided into three blocks (denoted
by symbols b1 ,b2 , and b3 ). Each person in this tract
is characterized by two discrete random variables, X his race, and Y - a location of his residence (a block to
which he is assigned). These variables are random because, due to an uncertainty introduced by census aggregation, we know only probabilities of each person’s race
and location. Let’s denote by p(X, Y) a joint probability
distribution of race and location for a person randomly
drawn from a tract. This joint probability distribution
can be calculated directly from block-level census data
by means of constructing a contingency table (a 2-D histogram of people in a tract) as shown in Fig. 2C. The distribution p(X, Y) contains all information we can obtain
from the census data about the spatial racial pattern of
the tract. The pattern can be inferred from the values of
p(X, Y), but because a real tract consists of a large number of blocks, a direct inference of pattern from p(X, Y)
is not practical. Thus, we compress the information in
p(X, Y) into just two indices, one pertaining to compositional (thematic) complexity of the pattern and another
pertaining to configurational (spatial) complexity of the
pattern. Because the IT deals with extraction of information from a probability distribution function, it is ideally suited for the task of obtained these two indices.

H(X) = log2 K − d(p, u).

(2)

The d(p, u) is a measures of a “distance” between histograms p(X) and u(X), it equals to zero if p = u and
it equals to log2 K if p(X) has only a single bin (the
tract is racially homogeneous). Thus, H(X) is a measure of “similarity” between histograms p(X) and u(X),
it equals to zero if histograms are maximally dissimilar
(a tract is racially homogeneous) and it has a maximum
value of log2 K if the tract has the uniform histogram.
From the above description, it is clear that H(X) is a
measure of compositional complexity of racial pattern,
or, in other words, a measure of racial diversity. For the
exemplar tract K = 4 and H(X) = 1.75.
Note the connection between diversity and uncertainty. Assume that census would withhold information
about racial shares in a tract leaving the total population
count as the only information available. In the absence
of any explicit or implicit knowledge about the race distribution, it is reasonable to assume a uniform histogram
which reflects our maximum uncertainty about a race of
a random tract’s inhabitant. Once the actual shares are
revealed our uncertainty decreases. The H(X) quantifies the remaining uncertainty; if an actual histogram
has only one bin, all uncertainty is removed, otherwise,
some uncertainty remains. The racial diversity of the
tract, as measured by H(X), is an uncertainty as to the

2.1. Information in tract-level data
When using only a tract-level data there is no information about inhabitant’s location (there are no blocks
to consider) but there is information about inhabitant’s
race. This information is provided by a distribution
p(X), which can be obtained from p(X, Y) by summing
the values in each column of the contingency table (see
Fig. 2C). For our exemplar tract p(X) has the following values: 0.25(W), 0.5(B), 0.125(H), and 0.125(A).

son drawn randomly from a given block instead of from
the entire tract.
The last column in a table shown in Fig. 2C gives
such uncertainties when drawing from blocks b1 , b2 ,
and b3 in the exemplar tract. Uncertainties associated
with blocks b1 and b3 are indeed smaller than an uncertainty associated with the tract as a whole (1.75), but
an uncertainty associated with block b2 is larger. However, the population-weighted average of these three uncertainties (H(X|Y) = 1.21) is smaller than an uncertainty associated with the tract as a whole (1.75). In
fact, Jensen’s inequality (Jensen, 1906) requires that
H(X) − H(X|Y) ≥ 0 for any tract, or any other region
with subdivisions which are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The difference between an uncertainty calculated from a tract and an average uncertainty calculated
from its blocks,

2.2. Information in block-level data
Using block-level data provides information about
both, race and location of tract’s random inhabitant. Information about inhabitant’s race is provided by p(X)
and is not different from that provided by the tractlevel data. Information about inhabitant’s location is
provided by a distribution p(Y), which can be obtained
from p(X, Y) by summing the values in each row of the
contingency table (see Fig. 2C). For our exemplar tract
p(Y) has the following values: 0.5(b1 ), 0.333(b2 ), and
0.167(b3 ). Note that p(X, Y) , p(X)p(Y) which indicates that variables X and Y are dependent.
Fig. 2B is a dot map depicting the exemplar tract using the block-level data. Although the placement of dots
within each block is random, it is not random with respect to the tract as a whole, in fact, we can observe
some degree of correspondence between race and location (block). Tract’s segregation increases (its racial
pattern become less complex) with the increase of correspondence between blocks and races. In other words,
the tract is increasingly segregated when we are (on average) increasingly less uncertain about a race of a per-

(3)

quantifies a degree of dependence between race and location variables and thus it quantifies a degree of tract’s
segregation. Thus, I(X, Y) is our second index which
pertains to configurational complexity of racial pattern.
In the IT the metric I(X, Y) is called mutual information.
By virtue of Jensen’s inequality I(X, Y) ≥ 0; it is equal
to 0 only if every block has the same shares of races as
the entire tract (a racial integration of the tract is perfect), and it achieves a maximum value equal to H(X)

if every block is racially homogeneous. For the exemplar tract I(X, Y) = 0.54. Thus, information contained
in the block-level data reduces the uncertainty about the
race of random inhabitant in the exemplar tract by 31%
with respect to the information contained in the tractlevel data, or by 40% with respect to no information at
all.
To summarize, using the IT we have derived two indices, H(X) and I(X, Y), which together provide a succinct description of tract’s racial pattern. Functionally,
the H(X) is equivalent to not-normalized Theil’s entropy
and I(X, Y) is equivalent to the not-normalized Theil’s
information theory index H (Reardon and Firebaugh,
2002). Note that H is a relative measure of segregation
– in our context, a difference between diversity of the
tract as a whole and a population-weighted average diversity of tract’s constituent blocks expressed as a fraction of whole tract’s diversity.
We submit that because of its relative construct, H
is not best-suited to measure segregation. Consider two
synthetic tracts visualized in Fig. 3. Both tracts, each divided into three blocks, have the same population of 300
people consisting of two racial groups denoted by B and
P. The population mixes of these tracts are synthesized
to be different; details are shown in Fig. 3. Visually,
there is no doubt that tract 2 is more segregated than
tract 1. This is reflected by the value of I(X, Y)2 being
four times higher than the value of I(X, Y)1 . However,
notice that H2 and H1 have comparable values with H1
actually slightly higher than H2 . Thus, whereas I(X, Y)
correctly reflects observations, H does not. It is not
that H is an incorrect measure of segregation, rather the
relative segregation it measures is not the information
that relates to how we perceive racial segregation (see
also discussion in Frankel and Volij (2007)). An almost
homogeneous tract (like the tract 1 in Fig. 3) is not perceived as racially segregated no matter how the mem-

bers of a small minority are distributed. For a tract to
be perceived as segregated it has to have a certain level
of diversity. By measuring segregation relative to diversity H is missing this important insight. The problem
is most conspicuous for low diversity tracts (which are
very frequent in 1990 data), but it exists for all levels of
diversity. Advantages of using I(X, Y) over H for segregation studies was previously discussed by Frankel and
Volij (2007) and Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2008).
3. Data and computations
We analyze tracts pooled from 41 metropolitan areas
(MSA). This dataset was previously used in Dmowska
and Stepinski (2018) on the basis of two criteria: (1)
the population of MSA was over 1 million in 2010,
and (2) all major ethnoracial groups were present in
1990, 2000, and 2010. For our analysis, we need population counts in standardized tracts and blocks. A
census block is the smallest geographic unit used by
the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulation of 100-percent
data; the median number of blocks in urban tracts is
59 and the median absolute deviation (MAD) is 27.
Although standardized tracts are available, for example, from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) (https://www.nhgis.org/) or
from GeoLytics (http://www.geolytics.com/), standardized blocks are not available. Therefore, we use
the SocScape (http://sil.uc.edu) high-resolution grids
(Dmowska et al., 2017) which are available for 1990,
2000, and 2010.
SocScape grids are the results of dasymetic modeling
(Dmowska and Stepinski, 2018); their values are designed to add exactly to corresponding census counts
within each block and tract. Thus, for our purpose,
the 2010 SocScape data is identical to the 2010 Census data. For 1990, we aggregate 1990 SocScape grid

same sector have similar values of diversity and segregation and thus belong to the same DivSeg class. Each
DivSeg class is labeled by a combination of symbols,
from D1 to D4, in the increasing level of diversity (low,
enhanced, moderate, and high), and from S1 to S4, in
the increasing level of segregation (low, enhanced, moderate, and high). Thus, for example, a racial configuration in a tract belonging to the class D4-S1 can be
succinctly described as integrated diversity, but a racial
configuration in a D4-S4 tract can be described as segregated diversity.

to 2010 boundaries of blocks and tracts. Differences
between population and racial subpopulations counts in
our standardized 1990 tracts and 1990 NHGIS standardized tracts are on average only 1%. Counts for our
1990 block counts cannot be independently checked due
to lack of analogous data. We subdivided population
into six ethnoracial groups (Whites, Blacks, Hispanics,
Asian, Native Americans, and others). For shortness,
we don’t use a “non-Hispanic” designation in front of
Whites, Blacks, Asian, and Native Americans.
There are 33,154 tracts in our dataset. For each
tract we calculate the values of H(x) and I(X, Y) in
t1 = 1990 and t2 = 2010. Plotting the pairs of indices
{H(X), I(X, Y)} collected from all tracts in a given year
as points in 2-dimensional graph results in the diversitysegregation (DivSeg) diagram depicting different patterns of racial distribution within urban tracts. Comparing DivSeg plots constructed for t1 and t2 reveals
the tendencies of change in tracts’ racial patterns (see
Fig 4A.)

The sixteen classes encapsulate all possible configurations of racial patterns. Fig. 4C shows the division
of DivSeg diagram into the sixteen sectors; an exemplar tract for each DivSeg class is given (no example of
class D1-S4 was found among 33,154 tracts). Only exemplars in segregation classes S3 and S4 conform to the
usual perception of what does it mean for the population
to be segregated, configurations in exemplars of segregation class S2 can be better described as clustering or
clumping. Thus, the term “segregation” commonly used
to describe the meaning of the I(X, Y) index may not be

To simplify the analysis and to provide a visualization
of those tendencies we classify all tracts into sixteen
racial configuration types based on their values of H(x)
and I(X, Y). To classify tracts we divided the DivSeg

the best choice; the term “aggregation” would probably better reflect the meaning of this index. Note that,
for visualization purposes, exemplars in Fig. 4 has been
purposefully selected so the largest subpopulation is of
the same racial group in each class, but the classes pertain to configuration and not to which racial group is
dominant. Thus, a tract will maintain its class designation if its racial subpopulations are changed (colors of
the dot on Fig. 4 are changed) providing that the pattern
remains the same.
By counting tracts belonging to each class in a given
year, we obtain DivSeg histograms with sixteen bins

from 1990 and 2010 data to reveal temporal trends in
tracts’ diversity and segregation levels.

diverse during the 1990-2010 period. The I(X, Y) distribution has also shifted to larger values but by a relatively small amount. Thus, U.S. urban tracts had become somewhat more segregated during the 1990-2010
period. Note that, because of the shapes of the distributions, summary statistics, such as the mean and the
standard deviation, or even the median and the median
absolute deviation (MAD), are not very informative.

values of H(X), I(X, Y), ∆H(X), and ∆I(X, Y) for counties in our dataset. Our dataset consists of 273 counties; we divided these counties into standardized tracts
for calculations of I(X, Y). Comparing distributions
of H(X) for counties and tracts shows that, in 1990,
counties were more likely to be diverse than tracts,
but, in 2010, counties and tracts have similar probabilities of having a given level of diversity. Interestingly, distributions of county-level I(X, Y) are almost
identical in both years. This shows that segregation at
the county scale (as assessed on the basis of their con-

Perhaps the most important information is given by
the two right-most panels in Fig. 5A which show distributions of 1990-2010 changes of H(X), I(X, Y) values.
In particular, statistically, the change of I(X, Y) is positive – a majority of tracts had increased their segregation
between 1990 and 2010. The distribution of changes in
H is shown by a gray-colored curve. Statistically, tracts
had also increased their values of H.

Fig. 5A shows distributions of the values of H(X),
I(X, Y), ∆H(X), and ∆I(X, Y) for urban tracts in our
dataset; ∆ indicates change, a difference between a 2010
value and a 1990 value of an index. Distributions of
both indices have changed significantly between 1990
and 2010. In 1990 most likely values of H(X) were low
(population in most tracts was almost mono-racial), but
in 2010 most likely values of H(X) were high (population in most tracts was multi-racial). Thus, the population of U.S. urban tracts has become significantly more

stituent tracts) remained statistically unchanged during
the 1990-2010 period. In 1990, the county-level distribution of I(X, Y) was very similar to the tract-level
distribution of I(X, Y), but while the tract-level distribution of I(X, Y) has changed during the 1990-2010
period to reflect an increasing segregation at the tract
level, the county-level distribution remained unchanged.
However, note that if segregation is measured by H,
most counties decreased their segregation during the
1990-2010 period (see the right-most panel in Fig. 5B).
This demonstrates that the conclusion about the trend
of racial segregation may depend on whether segregation is assessed using an absolute measure (I(X, Y)) or a
relative measure ( H).

41%/44%, while the number of tracts in medium/high
segregation classes (S3/S4) increased from 5%/2% to
12%/3%.
Increased diversity of a tract’s population increases
the potential for an increased level of segregation because the maximum possible level of absolute segregation is higher for a more diverse population (see Eq.3).
However, a higher level of diversity does not automatically translate into a higher level of segregation. In principle, there is nothing to prevent an increasingly diverse
tract to maintain racial integration, that is, to evolve
from, for example, class D1-S1 in 1990 to class D4S1 in 2010. However, the data shows that it is more
likely that a tract classified as D1-S1 in 1990 evolved
to a class D1-S2 to 2010, thus increasing its segregation
while increasing its diversity.
DivSeg histograms show the initial (1990) and final (2010) statistics of tracts’ racial configurations but
not the details of how the change has occurred. During the 1990-2010 period, all tracts changed their
{H(X), I(X, Y)} values. If the change resulted in the
reclassification of the tract on the DivSeg diagram we
call it a transition; 80% of tracts in our dataset transitioned during 1990-2010, while 20% did not change
enough to be reclassified. A full accounting of transitions is provided by a 16×16 transition matrix. A
{i, j} entry in the transition matrix is a number of
tracts which are classified as a class i in 1990 and
as a class j in 2010, where i and j takes values
{D1 S1, D1 S2, . . . , D4 S3, D4 S4}. Transition
matrix shows statistics of types of changes and helps to
understand the character of the process responsible for
that change.
Fig. 7A is a visualization of the transition matrix. The
transition matrix has the same organizations as the DivSeg histogram; it is divided into 16 sectors each corresponding to DivSeg classes in 1990. Tracts classified to
a given class in 1990 are redistributed to other classes

Fig. 6 shows an example of a tract which in 1990 had
a typical configuration and underwent a typical change
during the 1990-2010 period. This visualizes what a
typical increase of segregation by ∆I = 0.07 means for
the change in the spatial pattern of racial subpopulations. In this example, the 1990-2010 change in the pattern is not large but it is clearly visible. Small increases
in the tract’s value of I(X, Y) may be due to the random
process instead of a systematic process (Leckie et al.,
2012; Jones et al., 2018), however the fact that 85% of
tracts have increased their values of I(X, Y) points toward the existence of a systematic process.
Fig. 4B shows normalized DivSeg histograms for
all tracts in our dataset constructed from 1990 and for
2010 data. Visually comparing the two histograms reveals that the overall tendency was for tracts to increase
their levels of diversity and also to increase their levels
of segregation in agreement with the results shown in
Fig. 5A. The number of tracts in low/enhanced diversity
classes (D1/D2) decreased from 33%/34% to 9%/26%,
while the number of tracts in medium/high diversity
classes (D3/D4) increased from 24%/9% to 35%/30%.
Similarly, the number of tracts in low/enhanced segregation classes (S1/S2) decreased from 76%/16% to

which lost tracts and orange circles indicate bins which
gained tracts; the size of the circle indicate the magnitude of gain/loss. Most net loses are to the low/enhanced
diversity, low segregation classes, while most net gains
are to the moderate/high diversity, enhanced segregation classes. This reiterates our earlier conclusion that,
statistically, tracts become more diverse and more segregated between 1990 and 2010.

due to the changes in their values of H(X) and I(X, Y)
during the 1990-2010 period. This redistribution is depicted by a 4×4 grid of circles which correspond to DivSeg classes in 2010. A percentage of tracts transitioning from class i in 1990 to class j in 2010 is depicted
by the color of a circle. Fig. 7B shows the D2-S2 sector
of the transition matrix in greater details. In 1990 there
were 1779 tracts classified as D2-S2 but only 274 of
them maintained this classification in 2010. Remaining
1505 tracts had transitioned to other classes as indicated
by numbers in Fig. 6B.

Overall, our results show that the 1990-2010 change
of racial patterns within U.S. urban tracts is toward
more diversity (racial shares of tract’s population become more even) but also toward more segregation
(racial subpopulations within a tract tend to aggregate
in different parts of the tract). Detailed social analysis of this observation is beyond the scope of this paper. Here we propose a following broadly-sketched hypothesis that may account for the results of our analysis. Increased diversity is due to nationwide social
processes over which individuals have no direct control.
This macro process permeates all spatial scales. However, social processes leading to racial aggregation at the
tract scale are controlled by individuals. As diversities
of tracts increase, individuals exercise their preferences

From Fig. 7A we observe a stochastic nature of tracts’
evolution. Tracts having similar racial configurations in
1990 (belonging to the same class) evolve differently
(there are many non-blue circles in each sector of transition matrix). This reflects local circumstances which
vary from one location to another. If those circumstances were totally random, net gains and losses to
histogram’s bins membership in the DivSeg histogram
will cancel themselves out and the histogram would not
change between 1990-2010. However, the DivSeg histogram has changed (see Fig. 4) indicating the existence
of prevailing trends in the transition matrix. The net
change to bins membership in the DivSeg histogram is
9

regarding their neighbors (Schelling, 1971) which leads
to an increasing racial aggregation (clumping of samerace households) throughout a tract. Because individual
actions only redistribute populations within tracts but do
not stop tracts’ tendency to increase their diversity, a degree of the same-race aggregation at the county level remained the same or changed only slightly between 1990
and 2010.

We stressed the importance of relating the values of
diversity and segregation indices to racial patterns as visualized by dot maps. Racial patterns are as close to the
“ground truth” of population distribution as we can get
given the character of the data. In particular, a diversitysegregation grid ( Fig. 4C ) of exemplar racial patterns
demonstrates that diversity and segregation are two fundamentally different aspects of racial patterns; diversity
(increasing from left to right) pertains to ratios of shares
of different races in a tract whereas segregation (increasing from bottom to top) pertains to the separation of different races into individual blocks.
These observations led us to classification of tracts
into sixteen diversity-segregation (DivSeg) classes
(Fig. 4B) and to the construction of the transition matrix
(Fig. 7) which provided detailed information on how the
membership of these classes changed between 1990 and
2010. The transition matrix revealed that a significant
share of 1990 tracts changed their DivSeg classification
to a variety of different classifications in 2010. This may
be because we analyzed a pool of tracts from different
metropolitan areas across the U.S. Future analysis will
address possible regional differences in tract-level diversity/segregation changes, as well as possible differences
in such changes between different parts of metropolitan
areas (for example, city center vs. suburbia).
We used pairs (1990 and 2010) of racial patterns
within the same tracts to visually assess a degree of
pattern change. We compared such change assessment
with the change assessment provided by numerical indices: ∆H(X) for the change in diversity, and ∆I(X, Y)
or ∆H for the change in segregation. We found that
values of ∆H(X) and ∆I(X, Y) agree with our visual assessment, but values of ∆H frequently disagree with our
visual assessment.
The finding that values of ∆H do not always correspond to what is seen in racial patterns is disconcerting because much of existing estimates of segregation
change is based on H. In Section 2 we show that H is
I(X, Y) relative to H(X). Because of its relative design,
H has desirable properties, its values are always in the
(0, 1) range and the upper limit of H corresponds to a
complete spatial separation of racial groups regardless
of how many groups are present. However, this relative design of H has also unintended negative consequences. For tracts with a low level of diversity, the ratio I(X, Y)/H(X) can be large because of the low value
of the denominator, even if the value of the numerator is
also low. This leads to a situation like the one illustrated
in Fig. 3, when, if we assume that tract 2 is the tract 1
in the later time, ∆H is negative and suggests decrease
in segregation whereas visual inspection of patterns, as

5. Discussion and Conclusions
We analyzed levels of racial diversity and segregation within U.S. urban tracts and magnitudes of their
changes during the 1990-2010 period. The most important result of our study is the finding that 85% of 1990
(standardized) tracts increased their segregation over the
following 20 years, and 78% of tracts simultaneously increased their segregation and their diversity. We hypothesize that the tendency for the residences of people of
the same race to spatially aggregate on a neighborhood
scale is the result of individuals’ reactions to nationwide
societal changes coming to their neighborhood. If such
a hypothesis is indeed correct, it indicates that, during
the period of 1990-2010, there was some level of disconnect between the nationwide trend toward multiracial society and residential preferences of individuals.
When the data from the 2020 census are released we
would be able to check whether this trend continues.
In order to use the same, standardized tracts and
blocks in 1990 and 2010, our analysis is performed using the gridded population data. Using gridded data
does not influence the values of diversity and segregation in 2010, but, conceivably, it may lead to inaccurate
population counts in 1990 and thus influence the values of segregation in that year. To check that this is
not the case we performed two tests. (a) We use gridded data to calculate ∆H at the county scale. The median value ∆H is −0.03 (see Fig. 5), in broad agreement with ∆H = −0.05 as calculated from the 1990
and 2010 censuses for metropolitan areas (Lee et al.,
2014), which are roughly of the same spatial scale as
counties. This shows that gridded data and direct census data yield the same conclusions, at least at larger
scales. (b) For the Cook County, Il we calculated values
of H(X) and I(X, Y) directly from the 1990 census tracts
and blocks data. Distributions of H(X) and I(X, Y) for
1990 tracts divided into 1990 blocks are almost identical to distributions of H(X) and I(X, Y) for standardized
tracts divided into standardized blocks. These checks
confirm feasibility of using SocScape grids to an analysis of diversity and segregation changes.

well as the value of ∆I(X, Y), suggests increase in segregation.
As recently discussed by Harris and Johnston (2018)
there is no single, best measure of segregation, Different
measures reflect different meanings of the term “segregation.” In this paper, we proposed that different measures can be assessed, although only qualitatively, on
the basis of the comparison of their values to the observed change of racial pattern. If we would use H instead of I(X, Y) to measure tracts’ segregation we would
find that 66% of 1990 tracts increased their segregation,
and 55% of tracts increased their segregation and their
diversity. These probabilities are lower than those obtained using I(X, Y), but the overall conclusion remains
qualitatively the same – the majority of tracts increased
their segregation during the 1990-2010 period. However, when we analyzed segregation of counties (divided
into tracts), the choice of a segregation measure led to
different conclusions, a no-change of the segregation
level when using I(X, Y) vs. a decrease of the segregation level when using H (see the counties segregation
change distributions in Fig. 5). Therefore, it is important to scrutinize what a given measure of multiracial
segregation means when interpreting the results of segregation change analysis.
Measures of multiracial segregation, the Thiel’s entropy, and information theory index, had been widely
used after they were postulated by Theil and Finizza
(1971) and popularized by Reardon and Firebaugh
(2002). However, it was recently noted (Chodrow,
2017b), that these indices sprang from the basic concepts of the IT. In Section 2 we presented a probabilistic
formulation of the racial distribution problem and derived two indices which describe diversity and segregation directly from principles of IT. As the two derived
indices happen to correspond to the indices already in
use, the introduction of the probabilistic framework was
not necessary to achieve the primary goal of this paper.
However, we consider the introduction of this framework to be a valuable result in its own rights.
The probabilistic formulation provides a formal and
complete framework for quantifying racial patterns. It
can be extended to use with gridded data without any aggregated subdivisions (Nowosad and Stepinski, 2018).
The quantification of the problem of racial distribution
requires only the basic form of IT when one variable
(race) provides information about the other (location).
However, an extension of the basic form of IT (Williams
and Beer, 2010) can be used to quantify how information from multiple variables (for example race and income) provides information about the location. Thus,
the IT formulation can be extended to analyze corre-

lations between multiple social factors and residential
distribution of inhabitants.
Theil’s information theory index is interpreted in
terms of the Theil’s entropy, but the Theil’s entropy is
not interpreted at all in population studies. Thus neither index has a convincing interpretation. The IT provides a clear interpretation of both indices. As shown
in Section 2, H(X) is an uncertainty as to the race of an
inhabitant randomly selected from the tract and I(X, Y)
is an average reduction of this uncertainty if an inhabitant is randomly selected from a block within this tract.
In the context of racial diversity and segregation, the
term “uncertainty” has also a clear interpretation. Uncertainty is the expected number of yes/no optimally
asked questions needed to determine a race of randomly
drawn inhabitant. This interpretation is possible when
the entropy is calculated using a logarithm with base 2.
Thus, to learn which one of the four possible races is
a randomly selected inhabitant of the hypothetical tract
featured in section 2, we need to ask on average 1.75
questions (average from the number of answers needed
to learn the race of several inhabitants). However, when
the inhabitant is drawn from any of the three blocks the
average number of questions is only 1.21.
Our goal in reintroducing indices of diversity and segregation in terms of IT is to take a fresh look at these
well-established concepts. In this paper, by doing so,
we reevaluated the Theils’s information theory index
vis-a-vis the mutual information, which is an older, and
a broadly used index in multiple disciplines. Our results indicate that the issue of how to measure multiracial segregation is perhaps worth revisiting.
