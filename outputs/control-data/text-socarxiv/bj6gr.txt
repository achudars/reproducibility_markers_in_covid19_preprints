The role of strategic reports and subjective admission
beliefs in explaining the ‘ethnic admissions gap’ in
English secondary schools

Abstract
Data from the English secondary school admissions cycle reveals a substantial ethnic gap in the proportion
accessing their chosen schools. Children from minority ethnic groups are, on average, 17% less likely to
be admitted into their top-ranked secondary school, compared to white children. This gap is large even
after controlling for socio-economic status and prior attainment. However, constraints on the length
of preference lists mean that stated preferences may not be truthful, as parents may have incentives
to strategise by excluding preferred schools. By accounting for strategic stated preferences and biased
beliefs about chances of admission, this paper recovers parametric estimates of preference parameters and
the degree of strategic selection. To examine the relative contribution of geographic sorting, strategies,
and market design (mechanism and admission rules), the corrected revealed preference estimates are
used to estimate expected welfare under three scenarios. The analysis reveals that both underlying
preferences and strategising behaviour exhibit substantial heterogeneity by ethnicity, income and ability.
When comparing welfare, I find that differences in admissions priority between white and minority
ethnic families create small but significant and consistent differences in welfare. However, larger welfare
differences are due to differences in preferences and strategy between the two groups.

Introduction

England has a well-established quasi-market for state-funded secondary schools, in which parents have a
right to express their preferences over schools, while parental choice is constrained by capacity at demanded
schools, and popular schools are usually oversubscribed. In spite of this, headline figures usually report that
the vast majority (around 90%) of families achieve their first choice of secondary school.
As welfare indicators, these statistics rely on strong assumptions of truthful preference reporting. The
admissions system is intended to encourage truthful reporting of parents’ preferences. However, constraints
on the length of preference lists, together with misunderstandings about the mechanism, introduce the
potential for strategic reporting (Haeringer and Klijn, 2009). This not only causes biases in reports of the
proportion of parents achieving their first choice, but also makes interpreting choice behaviour using reported
preferences difficult. Perhaps most importantly, it adds to the psychological and cognitive burden of parents
negotiating a decision that will have long-lasting effects on their children’s education.
Moreover, when admissions statistics are disaggregated by location, socio-economic status and ethnicity,
substantial heterogeneity is revealed, with minority ethnicities in particular much less likely to achieve their
first choice school. These strong empirical patterns in admissions, which have only recently been revealed by
the availability of disaggregated data, require an explanation that takes into account geographical sorting,
admissions priority rules, heterogeneity of preferences, and the possibility of strategic choice.
This paper takes as its starting point a striking empirical regularity – the ‘ethnic admissions gap’ in English
secondary schools – and asks whether the gap is caused by some features of the way that white and minority
ethnic parents choose schools, or can be explained by the strong geographical sorting in populations, or is
due to some structural inequality in the design or implementation of the admissions system.
Answering this question requires recovering the true distribution of preferences for school attributes, and the
strategic, or admission-regarding, trade-offs that parents make in completing their constrained rank-order
lists. This, in turn, requires accurately imputing the admission probability that each child would face if she
were to apply to each school. Both of these tasks are challenging.
To address strategic reporting, I estimate a simple model of admission-regarding preferences, which I characterise as an approximation to a structural model of choice under uncertainty, to recover estimates of marginal
rates of substitution and welfare for different demographic groups in different locations. This second-stage
model requires, as an input, estimates of the admission probability for both listed and unlisted schools.
To impute admission probabilities the paper estimates a structural model of coarse priority and tiebreakers,
using the universe of almost 500,000 admission decisions from the 2013 secondary school admissions cycle.
Due to the nature of the English admissions system, admission probabilities must be estimated with precise
information about the tie-breaker (home-to-school distance) but little information about other aspects of
the coarse priority structure. For example, there is no data about whether children have siblings already
2

attending schools, or the details of families’ religious worship. However, parents have perfect information
about these important priority shifters, and this information will plausibly have a large effect on their
choice behaviour. This sets up a selection-on-unobservables problem that must be addressed to obtain valid
structural predictions of probability of admission.
I exploit the fact that parents observe their child’s priority, which means that each family’s rank order list
potentially contains ample information to impute their priority status. This information is excludable from
the structural admissions equation because each school does not observe the entire rank-order list, so if any
characteristics of the entire rank-order list are correlated with probability of admission, this must be due
to priority-revelation rather than a structural effect. Therefore, we can use parents’ choice behaviour to
make inferences about their likely priority level. The addition of priority-revealing variables attenuates the
omitted variable problem, to allow consistent estimation of the admission probability.
Finally, the paper presents estimates of the gap in expected log welfare, between parents’ true preferred
school, and the best school that they can achieve given capacity constraints, and the school that they
actually achieve. These comparisons provide evidence on the relative contributions of geographic sorting,
admissions constraints, and sub-optimal strategies to differences in parental satisfaction between groups.
The analysis supports the findings in previous literature (Gallego and Hernando, 2009; Bertoni et al., 2017;
Deming et al., 2014; Burgess et al., 2015) that preferences, measured by marginal rates of substitution
between school proximity and school qualities, are heterogeneous across demographic groups. In contrast to
previous work, the results emphasise heterogeneity by ethnicity rather than socio-economic status, although
both exist. Minority ethnic families have a higher willingness to travel for observable aspects of school quality
relating to academic performance, but they appear to place less emphasis on peer-related measures such as
the proportion of low income children at a school.
The analysis also reveals that all demographic groups take account of admission probability when selecting
which schools to list, but that white, non-poor parents appear to be far more admission-regarding in making
choices than all other demographics. The estimates of admission-regarding preferences imply either that
white, non-poor parents have lower subjective assessments of admission probability than other parents, or
that they are more cautious in selecting schools to list. It is therefore not clear whether estimates reflect
differences in risk appetite, or asymmetric information.
The results of the welfare analysis suggest that, before taking capacity constraints into account, there is
little to no difference in the quality of choice sets for different demographic groups, implying that geographic
sorting plays only a small role in welfare differences. However, taking into account admissions priority
rules and the design of the admissions system, a gap emerges in welfare between white and minority ethnic
families, and between low income and higher income families. Minority ethnic families have a slightly larger
gap between their maximum unconstrained welfare, and the optimal welfare that they can achieve under
admissions constraints. This gap increases when comparing the welfare of optimal strategies to the welfare
3

actually achieved.
These results imply that the ethnic admissions gap does reflect an underlying welfare gap. This gap is partly
due to structural inequalities in the admissions system, which previous research suggests may include faith
schools’ admission rules (Weldon, 2018). However, the largest part of the welfare gap cannot be explained
by structural differences and therefore must be due to behavioural differences. This demonstrates, therefore,
that white, non-poor parents’ more admissions-regarding choice strategies ‘pay off’ by allowing them to
achieve allocations that are closer to the optimum, and that the English admissions system is far from
strategyproof.
There are a number of recent papers that have documented notable differences between white and minority
ethnic parents and children’s attitudes to education and educational investments in the English context,
and the interaction between ethnicity and socio-economic status (Dustmann et al., 2010; Wilson et al.,
2011; Chanfreau et al., 2015; Stokes et al., 2015). The evidence suggests that minority ethnic parents tend
to have higher educational aspirations, and be more willing to invest in education, than white parents
with similar incomes. This paper adds to this evidence base, and is the first to quantify the difference
in terms of willingness to trade off convenience (proximity) for academic performance in schools. The
paper is also the first to document and analyse an ethnic gap in the chances of accessing one’s preferred
schools. Understanding this ethnic gap will contribute to understanding the cultural, structural and material
determinants of educational investments.
This work is also related to a growing literature combining structural empirical modelling of strategic school
choice with topics from market design (Calsamiglia et al., 2010; Klijn et al., 2013; Abdulkadiroğlu et al.,
2017; Cantillon, 2017; Chen and Pereyra, 2017; Calsamiglia and Güell, 2018). Within this recent body of
work, a handful of papers investigate non-strategyproof markets by explicitly estimating joint models of
strategic choice and the probability of admission (Ajayi, 2013; Calsamiglia et al., 2014; Fack et al., 2015;
Ajayi and Sidibé, 2016; Agarwal and Somaini, 2018; Luflade, 2018).
Of these papers, Fack et al. (2015) avoids modelling strategic choice, but instead posits methods for recovering
the distribution of preferences that are robust to strategy. Calsamiglia et al. (2014) and Agarwal and Somaini
(2018) model decision-makers divided into strategic and sincere types, and estimate the proportion of each
type in the population. Both papers find that the population contains both strategic and sincere decisionmakers, but do not characterise this variation in terms of demographics.
This paper takes an approach more similar to Ajayi (2013), Ajayi and Sidibé (2016) and Luflade (2018)
by estimating parametric subjective beliefs as deviations from an objective probability. Strategic choice is
therefore modelled as a matter of degree rather than of discrete types. In relation to this body of work, this
paper is the first to explicitly estimate variation in strategic choice to demographic groups.
The paper is structured as follows. The next section introduces the main empirical facts that the paper

Empirical evidence on ethnicity and admissions

The detailed break-down of parental satisfaction statistics by location, ethnicity, ability and other factors
only became possible when the Department for Education released individualised preference records (Burgess
et al., 2017). Figure 1 shows the proportions of each demographic group obtaining a place at their top-ranked
school. It reveals that the difference in the proportion of children from minority ethnic groups achieving
their first choice is striking, and remains so after controlling for variation on other demographics.
The variation in probability of admission by KS2 attainment is also large. In this respect note that KS2
attainment is only observed after the admissions process, so any relationship between KS2 and admission
must be indirect, via correlations between KS2 and child and family characteristics. Children with higher

The mean number of schools ranked by applicants in 2014, by ethnic group, Pupil-Premium status and KS2-attainment tercile
for England and London. Higher ability children’s parents, and minority ethnic children’s parents, rank more schools on average.
Parents of children eligible for Pupil Premium rank slightly fewer.

KS2 attainment are less likely to obtain a place at their first-choice chool. Conversely, the difference in the
percentage achieving first choice of those families eligible for Pupil Premium is more modest.
The minority ethnic population in England is highly clustered, with a large proportion of minority ethnic
families living in the largest cities. In general the probability of admission to any school is smaller in urban
areas, because the population density is higher and therefore school catchment radii are smaller. To check
for possible sensitivity of the patterns to population density, the same figure has been produced only for
children living in one of the 32 boroughs of greater London. As expected, in the second panel of Figure 1,
which shows admission statistics for London only, the admission gap between white and minority is smaller,
but is still large compared to variation by income and attainment.
Of these patterns, the gap in KS2 admissions is more readily explained as a result of parental behaviour.
For example, a plausible explanation is that parents of more able children are more willing to state risky
options such as popular grammar schools1 , perhaps mitigated by an ‘insurance choice’ stated lower down
the rank-order list, or the outside option of private schooling for those on higher incomes (Calsamiglia and
Güell, 2018). To put it another way, it is quite difficult to imagine a structural difference in access to schools,
that would differentially affect more able students. In contrast, the ethnic gap could reflect a behavioural
1 Grammar schools are schools with academic exam entry (see below). The grammar school admission process differs across
English local authorities (LAs). Usually children sit the exam and are informed of their result as well as the threshold before
their parents complete the rank-order list. However, in some LAs where there are several grammar schools, or where the child
is outside the school’s catchment area, passing the exam does not guarantee a place at a particular school.

difference, but could also plausibly reflect a structural2 gap in the chances of admission. A number of aspects
of the admissions system could explain the gap, including: residential sorting causing uneven proximity to
good schools; the design of catchment areas; grammar school exam thresholds; religion-based faith school
admission rules; or some other aspect of the design of admission markets and oversubscription rules.
Other descriptive evidence supports the hypothesis of differences in decision-making between ethnic groups.
Figure 2 shows that in England and also in London, minority ethnic families rank more schools on average
than white parents, after controlling for KS2 attainment and Pupil Premium status. Figure 11 in the
appendix reveals that minority ethnic parents list schools with slightly higher test scores than white parents,
and list schools that are further away on average. Understanding the reasons for these differences, and the
extent to which they evidence unequal chances of admission to schools due to geography or other factors, or
diversity in school-choice strategies, is the focus of this study.

Setting and Data
English secondary school admissions

In England, children transition from primary school to secondary school at age 11. To apply for a place
at a state secondary school in England, parents submit a ranking of their preferred schools. They can list
between 3 and 6 schools depending on the Local Authority (LA). Parents must apply within their own LA,
but may include any school within or outside their own LA on their list. Local authorities allocate places
according to a matching mechanism co-ordinated by each LA or collaborations between neighbouring LAs.
Since first-preferences-first mechanisms were banned in 2007 (Department for Education and Skills, 2007),
use of the deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962) has become ubiquitous (Coldron
et al., 2008; Pathak and Sönmez, 2013). For oversubscribed schools, allocation of places is prioritised based
on a set of criteria which depends on the school, typically including: whether the child is in the care of the
local authority (“looked-after” children); whether the child has an older sibling at the school; and, finally,
the distance from the school. In some schools, religious worship or baptism forms the main criterion. In a
small proportion of state schools, priority is given to those displaying an aptitude at a particular subject or
a range of subjects. Finally, there are a small number of grammar schools which fill all of their places based
on performance in an exam, known as the 11+ exam. If a pupil cannot be allocated to any of their listed
preferred schools, they are assigned to a school with spare capacity. In spite of this, many parents list fewer
than the maximum allowed number of schools.
Schools can be categorised into six broad groups, according to their admissions policy and ethos.
2 Throughout this paper, the term ‘structural’ is used to distinguish those aspects of the design of admission rules or the
admission system that materially affect the admission probability, as opposed to behavioural differences that only affect the
admission probability through self-selection.

Community schools The first group comprises those schools owned and controlled by LAs, comprising
20% of secondary school places in 2014. These schools generally have simple admissions criteria, prioritising
siblings, “looked after” children and those living within a designated zone, with straight-line distance used
as a tie-breaker. Until recently the largest group, since 2010 many formerly community schools have been
converted into state-funded private schools called “academies”.
Non-faith academies3 This second group is now the largest group, enrolling 57% of state-funded secondary
school children. These schools have some autonomy to set their own admissions criteria although within
the strict guidelines set by the government. Many academies have similar admissions criteria to community
schools.
Roman Catholic schools 11% of secondary school children are enrolled in Roman Catholic schools, making
this the largest faith school denomination in secondary schooling. RC schools usually select up to 100% of
their intake on religious grounds. At many schools proof of baptism is sufficient, although at the more
popular schools proof of regular church attendance may be required. Some schools reserve a proportion of
places for children of other faiths/no faith.
Church of England schools The second largest providers of denominational secondary schooling are
Church of England (C of E) schools (7% of places). A majority of C of E schools also require proof of
religious worship for some or all places. The admissions criteria of CofE schools are more heterogeneous,
and support for religious selection less unanimous in the Anglican sector than in the Roman Catholic sector.
Other faith schools There are a very small number (less than 1%) of schools with religious denomination
other than Christian. These schools often operate faith-based admissions criteria for some or all places.
Grammar schools There are 162 academically-selective grammar schools (enrolling 5% of children) – the
remainder of a much larger system of academic selection that existed prior to the 1970’s. To obtain a place
at a grammar school children are required to sit an academic exam. In some Local Authorities all 11-year old
children sit a common exam, whereas in others only children who wish to apply to a school sit the school’s
exam.
Strict government guidelines regulate the admissions criteria that schools are permitted to use. Some unlawful
criteria include: interviews or other face-to-face contact; rank-order (eg. first-preferences-first); parental
contributions or volunteering. In addition, new schools have more stringent restrictions on religious and
academic selection than existing schools. All schools, except community schools, may opt to receive a list of
applications (without information on the preference order) and rank them before sending the ranking back
to the LA for the matching to be computed. For community schools the LA computes the ranking.
It is worth noting that, in contrast to many other countries operating centralised school admissions, lotteries are almost unheard of as a priority tie-breaking mechanism. The final tie-breaker for the majority of
3 Many faith schools and grammar schools are also designated as academies, but for the purposes of this study this category
only includes those academies which are not faith schools or grammar schools.

community, academy and religious schools is straight-line distance between the school and the pupil’s home
address. The distance tiebreaker creates the conditions for house prices to be affected by the proximity of
good schools (Gibbons and Machin, 2006; Gibbons et al., 2013). This reliance on geographical priorities
means that admission to schools is deterministic and depends only on priority, distance from the school,
and the actions of other parents. However, uncertainty about the actions of other parents, combined with
possible uncertainty about one’s own priority, introduces subjective uncertainty from the point of view of
the decision-maker.

3.2

Strategic reporting

There are two aspects of this system that may lead to strategic reporting. First, although, under studentproposing DA, truth-telling is a weakly dominant strategy (Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez, 2003) this is not
necessarily the case when preference lists are short and parents are forced to truncate their preference reports.
Haeringer and Klijn (2009) show that, if the maximum rank-order list size S is smaller than the number of
acceptable schools, it is no longer a dominant strategy to list one’s top S schools truthfully. Specifically, it
may be optimal to remove some of the top S schools from the list, so as to leave space to allow less-preferred
schools to be included. However, it is always a dominant strategy to list those schools which are included in
the list in the order of true preference. I present evidence that in many Local Authorities, 3 to 6 slots are
not sufficient and therefore parents are incentivised to consider their chances of admission when reporting a
subset of their true preferences, to avoid being assigned to a school with spare capacity.
The second aspect is the complexity of the matching mechanism, and uncertainty in admissions probabilities,
that leads to erroneous beliefs about optimal strategies. It is suspected that misunderstanding of the rules
of the matching mechanism is widespread.
In the presence of strategic reporting, the observed proportion of parents achieving their reported firstchoice school is not a good indicator of welfare. In addition, differences in this measure by ethnicity,
socio-economic status or other demographic variables may reflect differences in strategic behaviour, rather
than real differences in welfare.

3.3

Data and sampling

In 2014 the English Department for Education began to collect individual reported preference lists from
all Local Authorities in England. The rank-order lists constitute parents’ formal applications to secondary
schools through local authority clearing houses. I exploit the first two cohorts of secondary school entrants in
the 2014 and 2015 admissions cycles. Each cohort contains rank-order lists for around 500,000 children who
are in their final year of primary school (aged 10-11), linked to their home postcode, ethnicity, gender, Pupil
Premium status (a proxy for low income), and primary school test scores from the National Pupil Database
9

(NPD). From the home postcode I can calculate their location and school proximity4 . The NPD also provides
detailed information on schools, including location, test scores, demographic composition, governance and
religious denomination. I also obtain current and historical government inspections (Ofsted) scores from the
online schools database, Edubase.
Individuals are eligible for inclusion in the sample if there exists a rank-order list record for the child, and
additionally they are either included in the year 6 census5 (final year of primary school), or the year 7 census
(first year of secondary school), or both, and their home postcode, ethnicity and KS2 attainment6 are not
missing. This means that those children transitioning from a private primary school, or who eventually
transition to a private secondary school, are potentially included in the sample as long as their parents
participate in the state-school admissions cycle.
The main focus of the paper is on ethnic variation in admissions. However, ethnic group is correlated with
material and educational contextual factors. It is important to control for these factors to obtain a clear
picture of variation in admissions decision-making and outcomes due to ethnicity. To this purpose, the paper
employs a consistent demographic cross-classification to allow for variation in incomes, academic attainment,
and ethnicity.
Much of the existing work on school choice focusses upon variation by socio-economic status or incomes, and
finds significant variation, so it is important to allow for this dimension in our classification by including
Pupil Premium status as a demographic indicator. The Pupil Premium (PP) is an initiative that awards
additional funds to schools for each child on roll who is eligible. Pupils are eligible for PP if they have been
eligible for Free School Meals at any time in the last six years, and pupils are eligible for Free School Meals if
their parents have low incomes and are in receipt of certain benefits. PP is therefore a proxy for low incomes.
I also control for variation in attainment at Primary school by including tercile of Key Stage 2 (KS2) SAT
scores in the classification. KS2 tests are taken by children at the end of the final year of primary school (at
the age of 11) and give an aggregated score for ability in English and Mathematics. It is important to note
that, as the admissions cycle takes place at the beginning of the final year of primary school, children will not
have taken the test when their parents are choosing schools, and schools will not observe KS2 attainment.
However, KS2 terciles are used as a correlate of unobservable family and child characteristics that affect
school choice and admissions. It is possible that KS2 terciles are endogenous with respect to admissions
outcomes. However, this is unlikely as KS2 tests are low-stakes tests from the point of view of the child and
parents. Since they have no bearing on admissions, there are no incentives for parents or children to alter
effort in response to admission decisions.
However, KS2 may be correlated with parental unobservables. In particular, KS2 outcomes may be af4 School proximity is measured as the straight-line distance between the centroid of the home postcode and the centroid of
the school postcode, in kilometres.

fected by spillovers from parental investments in gaining entry to grammar schools, such as helping children
with homework, maintaining discipline and procuring private tutoring. KS2 tercile therefore incorporates
information about the parents’, as well as the children’s, unobservable type with respect to human capital
investments. To the extent that these investments are predetermined at the time of school choice this does
not bias estimates, but it should be borne in mind when interpreting results.
Ethnicity is measured in the NPD based on parental reports. There are 18 ethnic groups in the original data,
listed in Table 5. For most of the analyses in the paper a two-way white/minority classification has been
used. While this two-way classification hides all distinctions between non-white ethnic groups, it ensures
that the aggregated sample size of the minority group is large enough when cross-classified by income and
attainment, and also ensures sufficiently large sample sizes outside London and the major cities. The fourway classification has been used in some of the graphical descriptive statistics. Weldon (2018) presents
descriptive analyses and also a discrete choice model estimated using the four-way classification, with the
conclusion that the important distinction with regards to school choice and admissions is between white
families and all other ethnic groups. Ethnicity is related to other constructs such as nationality, religion,
language and the length of time spent living in the UK. It is possible that phenomena ascribed to ethnicity in
the paper should more properly be ascribed to one of these other constructs. However, the other constructs
are not recorded in the data used in this study.
There are therefore 12 demographic groups defined by the cross-classification of ethnicity (white/minority),
Pupil-Premium status (eligible/not eligible) and KS2 attainment terciles (high/middle/low). For each child
we observe their demographic group, home location at the postcode level, rank-order list, the offered school
and the school that the child was subsequently enrolled in.

Estimating admission probabilities

To model strategic choice under uncertainty about admission probabilities, the usual approach is to undertake
a two-stage analysis, where the first stage involves modelling the admission probabilities themselves, or
beliefs about them. Several authors have addressed this empirical problem. The most common approach to
constructing admission probabilities is to take account of uncertainty in the admission thresholds, or cutoffs,
at each school caused by the unknown distribution of other applicants and their preferences or strategies. In
some applications authors also take account of uncertainty about the priority rule, the realised priorities, or
both.
In order to estimate a portfolio-choice model for exam-based admission to Ghanian secondary schools, Ajayi
and Sidibé (2016) model subjective probabilities of admission derived from uncertainty about both personal
exam performance, and score thresholds (cutoffs) of schools. Decision makers infer exam cutoffs with error
by observing cutoffs in previous years at the same school. Luflade (2018) also models the distribution of

11

exam admissions cutoffs as inferred from previous years’ observations, for a model of university choice under
constrained lists in Tunisia.
Fack et al. (2015) obtain data on students’ priority scores and schools’ cutoffs, and use this information
to model preferences under more or less stringent assumptions of strategic choice. This involves modelling
admission as a deterministic decision. However, they do not explicitly consider admissions uncertainty.
Agarwal and Somaini (2018) assume perfect knowledge of coarse student priorities, with uncertainty introduced by the actions of other decision-makers and the random tiebreaker. Rather than estimating
atomic success probabilities for each school, Agarwal and Somaini (2018) estimate the full vector of assignment probabilities for a given ranked list, and therefore accommodate the rank-dependent priorities of
the immediate-acceptance algorithm in use in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Admission probabilities are estimated by resampling and simulation of matchings. The relatively small cardinality of the set of ranked
lists in their application means that this approach is computationally feasible. Calsamiglia et al. (2014) also
estimates admission probabilities consisting of a deterministic priority plus a random tiebreaker.
In the current study, admission probabilities must be estimated with precise information about the tiebreaker (distance from the school) but little information about other aspects of the coarse priority structure.
For example, there is no data about whether children have siblings already attending schools, or the details of
families’ religious worship. However, parents have perfect information about these important priority shifters,
and this information will plausibly have a large effect on their choice behaviour. This sets up a selectionon-unobservables problem that must be addressed to obtain valid structural predictions of probability of
admission. However, the fact that parents observe their own priority means that each family’s rank order
list potentially contains ample information to impute their priority status. This information is excludable
from the structural model of admissions priority because each school does not observe the entire rank-order
list, so if any characteristics of the entire rank-order list are correlated with probability of admission, this
must be due to priority-revelation rather than a structural effect. Therefore, we can use parents’ choice
behaviour to make inferences about their likely priority level.
For example, if children whose parents submit a shorter rank-order list are more likely to be admitted to
their first-choice school, this must be due to a correlation between being confident of admission into the
top-ranked school, and not feeling the need to list the maximum number of schools. It cannot be directly an
admissions priority rule, since each school does not know the length of each child’s rank-order list. Therefore
this information cannot directly be used to impute counterfactual admission for a child who did not apply
to a school, but it can be used to ‘mop up’ omitted variable bias due to selection-on-unobservables.
This “self-revelation” approach is related to Heckman (1979) corrections. The control-function approach was
derived for multinomial choice models by Dubin and McFadden (1984), and employed by Abdulkadiroğlu
et al. (2017) to estimate causal effects of schooling. It is also related to the matching models of Dale and
Krueger (2002). However, the approach taken in this paper differs in that it relies on observables correlated
12

with unobserved priority, rather than attempting to model the distribution of the unobservables directly.
This has the advantage of placing weaker assumptions on the functional form of unobservables.
Priority-revealing variables, excluded from the structural admissions equation, attenuate the omitted-variables
bias and are then integrated out of the average structural function (ASF) (Blundell and Powell, 2004). The
latter is used for prediction of admissions probability on the second-stage dataset.

4.1

Identification of the Average Structural Function

Azevedo and Leshno (2016) develop a model of large many-to-one stable matching markets, such as school
markets, and show that the equilibrium matching can be characterised by a set of market-clearing priority
cutoffs at each school, which play a role analogous to market-clearing prices. Agarwal and Somaini (2018)
build upon this to develop a general model of admission mechanisms which, in large markets, can be characterised by priority scores which may depend upon the decision-makers’ reports, and market clearing cutoffs.
They show that this model applies to a large class of stable and non-stable matching mechanisms.
Most admissions oversubscription policies in England share a common lexicographic structure. Two or
more coarse priority groups define the high-level ranking, and a continuous measure breaks ties between
children in the same priority group. The coarse priority structure can be represented by an index function
φ : {0, 1}K → Z≥0 , that assigns to each child i with binary criterion-vector ci of length K a priority group
φ(ci ) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , Nφ }. The school fills its quota in order of priority from bottom to top, so that children
with priority zero are allocated first. A continuous tie-breaker measure is used to assign priorities within
each priority group. In the US and other countries it is common for a random lottery to be used to break
ties. However, in England lotteries are rare and distance is the most commonly-used tie-breaker. West et al.
(2004) reported that 86% of secondary schools used distance as a tie-breaker. Since then the proportion is
likely to have risen, since successive legislation has narrowed the range of legal priority rules. The tie-breaker
can be incorporated into the ranking function by defining a monotonic mapping ν : [0, ∞) → [0, 1). Then
the strict ranking of applicants i by school j is determined by ηj (cij , dij ) = φj (cij ) + ν(dij ).
However, we do not observe realisations of the coarse ranking function. Instead, we observe individual
admission decisions yij (cij , dij ) ∈ {0, 1}. Because of this, it is not possible to recover the entire coarse
ranking function. However, observing yij allows for local identification of the index function and index
function thresholds around the marginal priority group (i.e. the priority group for whom the distance tiebreaker is decisive). Figure 3 shows that observing repeated admission decisions at either side of the sharp
discontinuity at the cutoff enables identification of the proportion of the population with criterion-vector
cij = c belonging to the marginal coarse priority group, defined as the group for which the distance tiebreaker is decisive. This in turn identifies the parameters ϕ∗ of the local index function and the lower and
upper thresholds (φ1 , φ2 ) of the local index function to scale and location for the marginal priority group.

Figure 3: Coarse priority plus cutoffs model
Diagram of the structural mixture model that jointly estimates membership of the marginal coarse priority group, and the
distance tie-breaker cutoff, for each school. If year-on-year variations in demand are not too large, the position of the distance
cutoff will vary, but the proportions belonging to the three identified priority groups will remain constant and admission decisions
will only depend on these three groups.

By extension the proportions belonging to the infra-marginal group I, grouping all coarse priorities higher
than the marginal group, and the extra-marginal group E grouping priorities lower than the marginal group,
are also identified.
In the current application the criterion-vectors ci are not observed. Instead, we observe a vector of proxies
for priority zij . This vector can be further split into pre-determined priority-shifters z1ij , and endogenous
priority-revealing variables z2ij . An example of the first kind of variable is ethnicity, which may be correlated
with religious worship and the likelihood of having older siblings at a school, and is pre-determined at the time
of decision-making. An example of the second kind might be the size or composition of the full ranked list,
besides the current school. For the current application, variables that are endogenous with respect to long-run
strategies but pre-determined at the time of application, such as residential location, primary school choice
and prior attainment, are treated as priority shifters and included in z1ij . The average structural function
conditions on priority shifters, and sums over the population distribution of priority-revealing variables.
Although the full priority function is not identified, the local priority index function (i.e. the index function
that predicts membership of the marginal priority group and its neighbours) is sufficient for predicting
admission probabilities and counterfactual matchings as long as the year-on-year variation in the cutoff is
not too large, that is, as long as the cutoff varies so that the marginal priority group remains the marginal

14

priority group. This assumption can be checked by simulating allocations using resampled rank-order lists
and the estimated rankings.

P (i ∈ Ej |zij ) = 1 − logit−1 (z 0ij ϕtj − φ1tj ),

Variables in z1 include each student’s primary school denomination (RC, C of E, other), two-way ethnicity
(white, minority), Pupil-premium status, binned KS2 test score, and an indicator for whether the school is
the student’s nearest school, intended to proxy geographical priority areas. Variables in z2 include the size of
the rank-order list, the position in the ranking of the current school, the number of grammar schools ranked
(excluding the current school), and the number of faith schools ranked (excluding the current school).
The average structural function (Blundell and Powell 2004) may be used with the estimated parameters for

Estimating preferences under strategic choice

Modelling the rational selection of schools in a constrained rank-order list is a hard problem. Despite
considerable recent attention devoted to the topic, the full model of expected utility maximisation remains
intractable for any but the smallest school markets, even after imposing parametric assumptions. For this
reason, this paper introduces a simple reduced form model, and characterises it as an approximation to the
full model of expected utility maximisation under uncertainty. First, let us introduce the full model.
The canonical model of strategic school choice is the downward recursive portfolio choice model of Chade
and Smith (2006). Under this model, the decision-maker chooses a portfolio of items in a sequential lottery
to maximise her expected utility subject to either a non-negative cost per item, or a maximum quota of items
in the lottery, or both. Lottery weights in each slot are composed from the product of the individual failure
probabilities of items in previous slots, and the individual success probability of the item in the current
slot. Adapting the notation of Agarwal and Somaini (2018), the lottery LRi ,ρi therefore depends not only
on individual success probabilities ρi , but also upon the ranking Ri .
In a school choice context, items are schools j, and we assume that the decision-maker i optimises her stated
preference list, subject to a maximum number of slots S. Parents have private indirect utilities for all schools
{vij }j∈J and choose the list that maximises expected utility

ui = ρir1 vir1 + (1 − ρir1 )ρir2 vir2 + · · · +

(1 − ρir0 )u+

r 0 =1

u+
iS is the expected utility of failing to be allocated to any school and being assigned to a school with spare
capacity by the local authority.
As the name implies, the downward recursive portfolio problem admits a recursive definition. The expected
utility of the last option, conditional upon being rejected from schools ranked higher, is u+
S−1 = ρirS virS +
(1 − ρirS )u+
iS . At each slot s the expected utility, conditional on being rejected from schools above is
+
u+
is−1 = ρirs virs + (1 − ρirs )uis .

The expected utility of the entire list is therefore
+
ui = u+
i0 = ρir1 vir1 + (1 − ρir1 )ui1 .

Note that the existence of a recursive definition of the problem does not imply that there is a recursive
solution to the problem. The definition above implies that at each slot s the decision-maker conditions on
both the set of schools above that slot and the set of schools below that slot. An exhaustive search of all
possible ranked lists quickly becomes infeasible. For example, a London resident deciding which six schools
to list, if only considering schools in the same borough (typically about 15 schools) would have to consider
16

15!/(15−6)! ≈ 3.6 million possible lists. The empirical evidence suggests that parents do not limit themselves
to only considering schools in the same borough.
In spite of this combinatorial complexity, Chade and Smith (2006) show that the decision-maker can select
an optimal lottery sequentially in O(N × S) time by adding, at each stage, the item (school) that provides
the largest marginal improvement in expected utility. However, the solution is not sequential in the sense of
progressing, forwards or backwards, through the sequence of slots s ∈ 1, . . . S. At each stage, an addition can
be at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the existing list. This result is therefore of little use for
constructing a structural empirical model, as the researcher does not know the order in which schools were
added, and a model combining all possible paths would be of similar complexity to an exhaustive search8 .

Agarwal and Somaini (2018) show that utilities are non-parametrically identified in the downward recursive
model. However, the unconditional likelihood is intractable as it involves integration over the complex joint
distribution of the random variables u+ .
However, this formulation suggests a simplifying approximation. Assume that, at any slot s, E[u+

This approximation relies on a strong assumption of large expected utility losses from failure to be admitted
at each slot. This assumption will be more accurate to the extent that the prospect of the administrativelyassigned school is sufficiently bad, and it is sufficiently likely.
Specifying a Cobb-Douglas cardinalisation of indirect utility leads to a log-linear model for the approximate
slot utility

5.1

Formation of beliefs about admission

Substituting admission probabilities estimated on the previous cohort‘s data into the approximate choice
model implicitly assumes that parents form beliefs about admission based on the previous year’s admissions.
That is, parents are backward-looking in assessing the probability of admission. Although strong, this
assumption is not implausible and has been made in other literature in the field (Ajayi, 2013; Luflade, 2018,
cf.). Agarwal and Somaini (2018) test the assumption against an alternative where parents use the current
year’s admissions. In the English system demographics and school capacities are rather stable so it is unlikely
that admission probabilities would change enough year-on-year to materially affect inferences.
In the literature on behavioural choice under uncertainty it is usual to allow decision-makers probability
assessments to differ systematically from objective probabilities (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Quiggin,
1982). Under the approximate admission-regarding model it is straightforward to allow non-linear distortions
to objective probabilities to enter into the approximate log expected utility. Inclusion of the parameter δ in
the specification is equivalent to a probability weighting function w(ρ) = ρδ . This is a one-parameter special
case of the Prelec weighting function w(ρ) = exp (−δ(− log ρ)α ) (Prelec, 1998).
Given that the model is only approximate, and admission probabilities are imputed, I avoid taking the
9A

set of qualifications taken at the end of secondary schooling at age 16.
Office for Standards in Education carries out inspections of all schools at roughly three-year intervals, and awards
headline grades: Outstanding; Good; Requires improvement; Special measures.
10 The

18

analogy to its conclusion by comparing the estimated weighting function to the rational benchmark under
the full model, δ = 1, as this comparison would be too sensitive to model assumptions. Rather, estimates
of δ are used to make qualitative comparisons between decision makers, and between decision contexts (list
slots) for each decision maker. That is, the model estimates differences in the degree of admission-regarding
preferences without pinning down how a given estimate of δ translates into comparative rationality or
accuracy of expectations. The welfare estimates introduced in the next section allow objective comparisons
of the outcomes of decision-making to be made which do not rely on estimates of δ.

Estimating welfare counterfactuals

Current UK education policy relating to inequalities of access to good schools focusses on the geographical
distribution of households and schools, and presupposes the existence of “cold spots”: areas without good
schools within a commutable distance (Department for Education 2016). The uneven distribution of good
schools is one possible explanation for the observed differences in the proportion accepted into their first
choice school. There are two additional competing explanations: first, differences in preferences and differences in strategy may mean that some demographics, minority ethnicities, for instance, are more likely
to apply to popular schools, and less likely to use private information about chances of admission to avoid
congested schools; second, the details of admission policies may lead to structural inequality in chances of
admission.
It is possible that all three factors contribute to observed patterns of sorting and unequal headline admission
statistics. It is also possible that, underlying the headline admission statistics, there is no actual difference
in ordinal welfare between different demographic groups. For example, it may be the case that some families
strategically edit their choice sets, so that their stated first choice is not actually their most preferred school,
whereas other families truthfully report their preferences.
To examine the relative contribution of geography, admissions rules, and strategy/preferences, I compute
expected welfare under three scenarios. I work with the expectations of log utilities rather than the expectations of Cobb-Douglas utilities, as the expectation of an exponentiated Extreme Value type I random
variable is infinite. Log utilities are scaled by βD(i) , so that log utilities are on the scale of log distance
(in km). Levels of utility have no direct economic meaning, and cannot be compared between groups with
different preference functions, as the level of utility is only defined up to a constant that depends on preferences. However, differences of log utilities can be compared, and are equivalent to log ratios of distance. For
example, a log welfare difference of 0.69 implies that the welfare difference is equivalent to having to travel
approximately twice as far. A population-averaged preference function is also estimated, which imposes
uniform preferences on all demographic groups, and allows direct welfare comparisons to be made.

This represents the average quality of the local school market, irrespective of whether the child can access it,
and takes account of direct disutility from distance, but not the effect of distance on chances of admission. A
single sample from the joint posterior distribution of (β, γ)D(i) is drawn for each child, so that the population
distribution of welfare incorporates posterior parameter uncertainty.
The distribution of i is conditioned upon a family’s rank-order list Ri in the following way: although,
under constrained lists, it may no longer be optimal to truthfully report all of one’s preferences, it is still a
dominant strategy to include those schools which are included in the list, in order of true preference (Fack
et al., 2015). I assume that decision makers do not play a dominated strategy, and therefore the distribution
of unobservables must be such that the preference order between schools in the submitted rank-order list
is respected. Note that this does not imply anything about preference ordering of schools not included in
P
the list. For this reason, the simple analytical expression E [maxj∈J log uij ] = log j∈J exp(µuij ) cannot be
used. Instead, I approximate the expectation by simulating draws from
|µuir1 + ir1 > · · · > µuirS + irS
using a Gibbs sampler to sample from truncated EV1 distributions for schools included in Ri , and sampling
from an unconstrained EV1 distribution otherwise.
The second welfare calculation characterises the welfare that a rational parent can achieve by submitting an
optimal list, given the constrained rank-order lists and school admissions criteria, and is

These welfare calculations, and the differences between them, represent the relative contributions of geography, preferences/strategies, and admissions constraints to average welfare for different demographic groups.
WA represents the welfare attributable to the geographic distribution of children and schools of different
quality, before accounting for congestion. The difference between WA and WB represents the welfare loss
attributable to capacity constraints, schools’ admissions criteria and the design of the allocation mechanism (including constrained list length). The difference between WB and WD represents the welfare loss
attributable to sub-optimal selection of rank-order lists. Care is needed in interpreting the gap between WB
and WD , since the difference also captures, to some extent, the quality of model fit. If some demographic
group has more heterogeneous preferences that are less strongly predicted based on observables, then the
difference between WB and WD may appear large. However, the variance of the estimate should also be
larger so that inferences should still be valid.

Parameter Estimates

Estimates of all parameters are tabulated in the appendices. Figure 4 shows estimates of the Willingness to
Travel for academic performance (proportion achieving five or more A*–C at GCSE) at 2.5km. The WTT
is calculated as

(AC5)

W T TD(i) (d) =

.

The estimates show that, with other demographics fixed, families of higher-KS2 children are always willing
to travel further for a school with higher test scores than those of lower-KS2 children. In addition, minority
ethnic families are willing to travel further for improvements in test scores than white families. For white
families, willingness to travel is lower for Pupil Premium-eligible children. However, ethnic minority families’
preferences, although varying strongly by KS2 attainment, vary very little by Pupil Premium status.
Table 1 shows large and precise estimates of δs , the “strategy” parameter for families ranking slot s. I
interpret estimates of δ with caution, noting that the parameter is more likely to absorb bias due to the
approximate likelihood than other parameters. The magnitude of δ is sensitive to both the slot and the total
number of schools ranked. δ is largest for those ranking only one school, and declines sharply as parents

rank more schools. For a given size of rank-order list, the parameter appears largest for the first preference,
but does not appear to decline after the second preference. There may be a slight “insurance school” effect,
where the parent has a larger δ for the school ranked last (i.e. “1st of 1”, “2nd of 2”, and “3rd of 3”), although
in general parents appear to take most account of probabilities in choosing their top-ranked school. There
is a small but precisely-estimated increase in δ for parents applying for schools in LA’s which allow them
to rank no more than three schools (short-list LA’s) compared to those allowing four to six. The estimated
mean difference is 0.109 (95% CI = [0.076, 0.139]).
Figure 5 splits the estimates for one rank-position by demographic group. Three patterns are clear: δ is
smaller for families eligible for Pupil Premium; it is larger for white families; and it is larger for parents
of children with higher Key Stage 2 (end of primary school) attainment than for parents of children with
lower KS2 attainment. It might be concerning if the patterns in δ qualitatively mirrored the patterns in β,
the distance parameter. This might suggest that the model is just capturing preferences for distance which
is correlated with probability of admission, which might be a concern even though the first stage equation
contains identifying variation. However, the pattern of δ by KS2 attainment is counter to the pattern of
β by KS2 attainment (cf. Figure 16). The parents of higher-KS2 children appear to place more weight on
admissions, but they place less weight on distance when choosing a school. Variation by demographic is not

Notes: The admission-probability scaling parameter δ is estimated by rank-order slot, by total
number of preferences ranked, and for local authorities allowing 4-6 slots, versus those only allowing 3. It is also estimated for each demographic, but only estimates for white, medium-attainment
non-Pupil Premium children are presented here. δ for other demographics are constrained to be
proportional to these. Estimates are posterior means, with posterior standard deviations in
brackets.

interacted with variation by rank-position or LA-type, so it is not possible to observe differences in δ across
the full rank-order list by demographic group. The use of admission probabilities in decision-making appears
to be dominated by white, non-Pupil Premium families, and particularly by more able children’s families.

Welfare estimates

Figure 6 presents estimates of the national mean of welfare for each demographic group. These calculations
are based on population-averaged estimates of the preference function, to allow between-group comparisons
of welfare. WA is the welfare of the choice set before accounting for admission constraints. This quantity
is about 0.15 higher for minority ethnic families, which is accounted for by residential sorting into urban
areas. In general, WA is higher for families living in urban areas because the school market is more dense
so disutility from travel is lower. Note that these results do not take account of variation in travel times.
However, as the population is also more dense, these differences in utility are cancelled out by accounting
for admissions (WB ).
Figure 7 presents the same welfare calculations for two predominantly-urban regions – London and the
West Midlands – for comparison. The variation in WA is much smaller, as the majority of families in these
populations live in urban areas, but the variation in WB is accentuated. The pattern of WB in London echoes
the pattern of δ shown in Figure 5; white, non-Pupil Premium families, and especially those with higher
KS2 attainment, have higher admission-adjusted choice set utility than all other groups. The difference, for
a high-KS2, non-Pupil Premium child is approximately 0.1, equivalent to a travel difference of 11%. There
is no mechanistic reason why this should be the case, since the strategy parameter is not used in the welfare
calculations. In the West Midlands, WB for minority ethnic, Pupil Premium eligible families is around 0.3

lower than for white, non-Pupil Premium eligible families. This is equivalent to travelling about 35% further.
Welfare differences are further analysed in Figure 8. These show that nationally, the welfare loss due to
admission constraints, WA − WB , is a little larger than 0.2 for white families, and almost 0.4 for minority
ethnic families, especially those eligible for Pupil Premium. The further welfare loss from not choosing
the optimal list, WB − WD , is even larger, and the gap between white and minority ethnic families is also
greater. Pupil Premium eligible, minority ethnic families have the largest loss in welfare due to sub-optimal
choice, and non-Pupil Premium eligible, high-KS2, white families have the smallest loss in welfare due to
sub-optimal choice. Figures 9 and 10 present these estimates for all English regions.

Conclusion

I have modelled parental preferences and school ranking functions with the intention of understanding
the apparent inequality in outcomes of the secondary school admissions process for children from different
demographic groups, especially with respect to the apparent ‘ethnic gap’ in chances of admission. Results
from the welfare analysis indicate that there is a real welfare gap underlying the ethnic admissions gap, and
that both the design of the admissions system (and admissions priority rules) and differences in parental
decision-making play a role.
With regards to structural factors, Weldon (2018) presents evidence that chances of admission to oversubscribed schools is lower for both ethnic minority and low income children after accounting for distance to
the school, and that most of this difference can be accounted for by church schools’ selection practices.
That study controls away residential differences, so it is not possible to say what proportion of admissions
inequality is due to ‘selection by house prices’.
With regards to behavioural differences between white and minority ethnic groups, some large and striking
differences in estimated trade-offs between school qualities, proximity, and chances of admission have been
estimated. On average, parents of minority ethnicities appear to place more emphasis on school test scores
and Ofsted scores, and less emphasis on measures of peers (% eligible for Pupil Premium), when choosing
a school. Lower-KS2 minority ethnic children’s parents are also more likely to apply to grammar schools
(cf. Figure 20) than lower-KS2 white parents. Taken together with the descriptive evidence, these results
consistently indicate a difference in preferences for academic performance. Minority ethnic parents seem to
value academics more, and make more aspirational educational choices.
In interactions between ethnicity and Pupil Premium status, the results indicate that the income gap in
preferences for educational quality (documented by Bertoni, Gibbons, and Silva (2017), Allen, Burgess, and
McKenna (2014), Burgess et al. (2015) and Deming et al. (2014) among others) is less evident for minority
ethnic children than it is for white children. Low income minority ethnic parents appear to value test score
performance and Ofsted grades almost as much as non-low income minority ethnic parents.
Results for the strategy parameter, δ suggest that white, non-low income parents are much more aware of,
or give much more heed to, their children’s chances of acceptance when choosing which schools to list, when
compared to both low income whites and minority ethnicities. That this relationship does not mirror the
estimates for willingness to travel for school quality, suggests that preferences for educational quality are
independent of admissions-consciousness. In fact, estimates of δ are almost a mirror image of estimates of
peer preferences (% eligible for PP; cf. Figure 18). White, non-low income parents appear to take note of
both chances of admission, and the socio-economic composition of the school. They appear to value more
affluent schools with a higher chance of admission, and to give secondary emphasis to academic performance.
The parallel between admission-consciousness and peer preferences might suggest a story whereby ‘sharp-

28

elbowed middle class’ parents are, in fact, motivated primarily by fear of negative social mobility, to make
‘safe’ choices characteristic of loss aversion. The theme of loss aversion by advantaged groups has been
explored in the sociological literature on school choice (Breen and Goldthorpe, 1997; Leonardi, 2007; Belzil
and Leonardi, 2013). In the economics literature risk aversion has been analysed in a couple of recent papers
(Chen and Pereyra, 2017; Klijn et al., 2013). In contrast, minority ethnic parents (both low income and
non-low income) make more ‘risky’, aspirational choices characteristic of optimism.
However, the welfare analysis suggests that, if deliberate, minority ethnic parents’ aspirational strategy may
be suboptimal. The welfare loss between the optimal report and the actual allocation is larger for minority
ethnic children11 This is in spite of the fact that they are more likely to take the sensible strategy of filling
their rank-order lists.
If not deliberate, the variation in admission-consciousness, and in admission welfare outcomes, may be
explained by information differentials between demographic groups (Bonal et al., 2017; Kloosterman and
Troyan, 2018). That is, white, non-poor parents may be better at accurately assessing admission probabilities
to oversubscribed schools. English secondary school admissions are complex, and there are a number of areas
where contextual information may give an advantage: faith school admissions; grammar schools; catchment
areas; and the design of the allocation mechanism itself for example. Given that minority ethnic parents are
aspirational and evidently wish to optimise their chances of accessing a good school (for example by ranking
more schools, on average, than white parents) an explanation based on information asymmetries seems more
plausible than trying to rationalise group differences in terms of deliberate attitudes to risk.
If non-white and low income parents are not choosing optimally in the current admissions system, what is
the best way to improve outcomes for these groups? One option would be to implement policies designed
to ‘nudge’ parents towards more strategic choices. However, it would be easier, and more equitable, to
redesign the admissions system to remove the incentives to choose strategically, and at the same time to
remove the structural inequalities in access that differentially affect minority ethnic and low income groups.
The simplest such policy would be to increase, or remove entirely, the maximum number of schools parents
may list. Other effective interventions would probably focus on the design of admission priority rules, and
reducing schools’ autonomy to set and implement their own admission policies.
The analysis in this paper has brought to light striking and welfare-relevant behavioural phenomena that had
hitherto been underappreciated. To obtain a thorough understanding of these phenomena will require more
than data analysis alone. Rather, further data analysis, in combination with social and economic theory and
qualitative research, may provide useful insights.

11 Welfare estimates are not a function of the admission-consciousness parameter, δ, and therefore provide independent
evidence of differences in strategy.

Figure 14: Proportion admitted to listed schools by distance quintiles and demographics. Quintile thresholds
are the same for all demographics. The striking pattern is that, at all distances, white children are more
likely to be admitted than other ethnic groups, even in community schools, and for this group the proportion
admitted remains high as distance increases. This suggests an explanation that takes into account differences
in strategic school selection.
