The hydrodynamic drag at a lipid bilayer surface determines in part the flow properties of suspensions of cells and liposomes. Given the fluidity of lipid bilayers, it is not obvious a priori
whether solid-like no-slip, liquid-like no-stress, or intermediate boundary conditions apply at the
water-bilayer interface. Though no-slip conditions have been widely assumed for many decades, this
fundamental aspect of membrane rheology has, to our knowledge, never been directly measured for
free bilayers. We applied light sheet fluorescence microscopy to image freely diffusing phospholipid
vesicles and determined the hydrodynamic drag coefficient CπηR, where η is the external fluid viscosity, R is the vesicle radius, and the dimensionless C characterizes the flow boundary condition.
We find that C = 5.92 ± 0.13 (stat.) ± 0.16 (syst.), matching the theoretical value of C = 6 for a
no-slip boundary and far from the C = 4 value for a zero shear stress boundary.

Interfaces between lipid bilayers and aqueous solutions
are present in countless environments both natural, such
as at cell and organelle membranes, and artificial, such
as in suspensions of liposome-encapsulated drugs. The
hydrodynamics of bilayers and bilayer-bound objects are
therefore of considerable interest [1–8]. In particular, the
rheology of red blood cells in vivo [9] and suspensions of
cells and liposomes in vitro [10, 11] depends directly on
the nature of the flow boundary condition of the bilayer
/ water interface. It has been widely assumed throughout work spanning many decades that this interface is
described by the no-slip condition characteristic of solidliquid interfaces [3, 12–16]. However, lipid bilayers are
Newtonian fluids [5, 7, 17], and it has been speculated
that their aqueous interfaces may therefore behave more
like no-shear-stress boundaries, or intermediate between
solid-like and liquid-like extremes [18]. Remarkably, despite its fundamental importance and widespread applicability, we are aware of almost no measurements of the
flow boundary conditions at lipid bilayer surfaces. One
study was able to use a dynamic surface force apparatus to probe lipid bilayers supported on solid surfaces,
reporting no-slip flow conditions [19]. However, the presence of a solid support is well known to alter membrane
hydrodynamics, reducing lipid diffusion by roughly an
order of magnitude compared to free bilayers and inhibiting large-scale spatial organization [20, 21]. To the best
of our knowledge, determining the flow boundary conditions at free lipid bilayers remains, surprisingly, an open
problem.
In principle, the flow boundary condition of an object can easily be determined from measurements of its
Brownian Motion. For a sphere of radius R, the diffusion
coefficient D is given by the the Stokes-Einstein relation
D=

kB T
,
CπηR

(1)

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the temperature,
η is the external fluid viscosity, and C is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the boundary condition.

It is well known that C = 6 corresponds to a no-slip
condition, as is the case for ideal solids, and C = 4 corresponds to an interface with no shear stress, as is the
case for a liquid sphere of zero viscosity. More generally,
for a sphere of viscosity ηinternal in an external liquid of
viscosity ηexternal , with
λ=

the boundary constant is [22–24]:

C=4

3λ + 2
2λ + 2

In practice, determining C by measuring D is nontrivial due to potential hydrodynamic influence from
nearby surfaces such as container walls, and the requirement of high-precision determination of the object’s positions and radius.
We surmount these challenges by applying light sheet
fluorescence microscopy [25–28] together with fast, accurate tracking techniques [29] to characterize the diffusive motion of spherical phospholipid vesicles. Light
sheet fluorescence microscopy provides optical sectioning of three-dimensional samples, enabling the imaging
of vesicles hundreds of microns (tens of vesicle diameters) away from the walls of the imaging chamber [26].
We verified our methodology by characterizing the diffusive motion of solid microspheres in an aqueous medium
and water droplets in benzyl alcohol, as detailed below,
which gives C = 6.28 ± 0.15 and C = 4.36 ± 0.28, respectively, consistent with theoretical expectations. We then
characterized lipid vesicles composed primarily of the
common phospholipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine), determining that C = 5.92±0.13 (stat.)
± 0.16 (syst.). This establishes that the bilayer/water interface is well described by a no-slip boundary condition.

METHODS

We performed light sheet fluorescence microscopy using a home-built instrument that closely follows the design of Keller et al. [28] and is described in detail in [27].
In brief, excitation light was provided by a 488 nm laser
with an output power of 50 mW, which was scanned by
a galvanometer mirror and focused by an objective lens
to form a sheet in the sample chamber. The minimum
thickness of the sheet was ≈ 3 µm, extending over a
lateral extent (Rayleigh length) of ≈ 100 µm. Images
were captured through a 40× 1.0 NA Plan-apo objective
lens (Zeiss) perpendicular to the excitation plane and
recorded with a 5.5 Mpixel sCMOS camera (pco.edge,
Cooke Corp.). A schematic of the setup is shown in Figure 1(a).
Suspensions of either lipid vesicles or polystyrene microspheres in 0.1 Molar sucrose, or deionized water
droplets in benzyl alcohol, were placed in a square crosssection glass cuvette (Starna Cells, part number 3-3.45SOG-3), which was mounted to a movable translation
stage and inserted in the light sheet microscopy chamber. The distance between imaged objects and the cuvette walls was several hundred micrometers.
For beads, droplets, and vesicles the optical plane intersecting the sphere center (the “equatorial” plane) was
readily evident due to a lack of out-of-focus light outside
the bright ring or disk, due to the few micron sheet thickness. This is illustrated in Supplemental Movie 1, which
shows a three-dimensional scan through a lipid vesicle.
To assess the accuracy of our methods, we examined
diffusion of objects with well known flow boundary conditions: solid polystyrene microspheres and deionized water droplets suspended in benzyl alcohol.
The microspheres were FITC-labeled polystyrene
beads of nominal diameter 15.45 ± 0.70 µm (mean
± standard deviation; Bangs Laboratory, part number
FSDG009). Light sheet fluorescence images were captured for durations of 15 seconds at 33.33 frames per
second. A typical image is shown in Figure 1(b). For
the first image, we determine the particle center using
the radial symmetry-based algorithm described in [29],
which provides rapid localization with accuracy close to
theoretical limits. In brief, the center is calculated as the
point that minimizes total distance to lines derived from
intensity gradients throughout the image. The original
algorithm was modified to only weight intensity gradients from the vicinity of the bead, limiting the effects of
noise outside the particle, such as fluorescent debris or
light from other beads. Each remaining image was cross
correlated with the previous image and the original radial symmetry-based algorithm was applied to the crosscorrelation to determine the shift between each frame.
From the particle positions, we determine the diffusion
coefficient D using the covariance based estimator de-

scribed by Vestergaard et. al. [30]. Not only does this
provide greater accuracy than, for example, linear fits
of mean-squared-displacements to time intervals, but it
also provides robust estimates of localization accuracy
and goodness-of-fit to a random walk model [30] that we
make use of in assessing vesicle data below. We experimentally determined the radius of each bead by Hough
transformation following edge detection [31], which produces from each input image a series of output images
corresponding to each possible radius candidate, with the
true object radius giving a bright, compact transform image. Across all beads, this gives an average diameter of
15.06 ± 0.41 µm (mean ± standard deviation), consistent
with the nominal value of 15.45 ± 0.70 µm. Using the
measured radius, the literature value for the viscosity of
deionized water, and the ambient temperature T = 293
K, we use Eq. 1 to determine C for each microsphere.
We show the histogram of C values for N = 29 microspheres in Figure 1(b). The mean ± standard error is
C = 6.28 ± 0.15, slightly higher than but consistent with
the expected C = 6 for solid particles. (Using the nominal rather than the measured microsphere radius gives
C = 6.12, matching the theoretical value within uncertainties. The microsphere edges are less well-defined than
those of the vesicles; in the latter case, we note explicitly
the uncertainty in R below.)
The assessment of liquid droplets is similar. The
droplets were deionized water dyed with 75 mg/ml fluorescein, suspended in benzyl alcohol, formed into an
emulsion by vigorous shaking. Fluorescein has very low
solubility in water, but nonetheless preferentially labels
the aqueous phase. Benzyl alcohol was chosen because
its density, 1.045 g/ml, is similar to that of water, limiting gravity-induced drift. The viscosity of benzyl alcohol is η = 6.29 × 10−3 Pa·s [32], and so the expected
C = 4.27. The droplets were imaged for 60 seconds at
8.33 frames per second. A typical image is shown in
Figure 1(c). Using the same procedures described above
for center positions and radii, we determined C for each
water droplet. Figure 1(d) shows the histogram of C values for N = 25 droplets. The mean ± standard error
is C = 4.36 ± 0.29, consistent with the expected value.
Notably, C increased with time for these droplets, likely
due to adsorption of fluorescein to the boundary. The C
value stated was determined from data within 20 minutes
of emulsion preparation.
The lipid vesicles we examined were composed of
94% DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine),
and 6% NBD-PE (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glyercero-3phophoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4yl) (Avanti Polar Lipids). Phosphatidylcholine lipids
are a major constituent of cellular membranes. The
headgroup-conjugated NBD probe has an isotropic
orientation relative to the lipid bilayer plane (unlike, for
example, probes such as Texas Red [33]), and so provides
vesicle images of symmetric fluorescence under polarized

laser excitation. The vesicles had radii between 3.1
and 25.7 µm with a mean of 12.2 µm and a standard
deviation of 4.0 µm. Vesicles were imaged for 15 seconds
at 33.33 frames per second. The vesicles were created
by electroformation, as in [34]. In brief, the desired
lipids were dried on glass slides with an indium tin oxide
coating, hydrated with a 0.1 M sucrose solution, and
subjected to an oscillating electric field to stimulate
vesicle formation. Vesicles were added to a sample
cuvette containing 0.1 M sucrose so that the interior
and exterior of the vesicles would be matched in density
and osmolarity. We use the literature value for the

viscosity of 0.1 M sucrose, η = 1.095 × 10−3 Pa·s [35],
in our analyses. Low levels of drift were present in the
experiments, possibly due to convection and imperfect
density matching. We therefore subtracted the best-fit
linear trajectory (i.e. constant velocity) from each vesicle
trajectory, and used only the horizontal component of
trajectories. Rare frame-to-frame displacements more
than three standard deviations from the mean (< 0.5%
of frames) appeared to indicate large-scale instrument
vibrations, and trajectories were analyzed piecewise
around such points.
We assessed the accuracy of center- and radius-finding
algorithms for vesicle images by applying them to simulated images of bright rings with a range of radii and
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), mimicking the form of the
vesicle images, as in Ref. [26] and similar to the ring
images in Ref. [29]. In brief, a high-resolution image of a thin annulus was convolved with the detection point-spread function (PSF), pixelated, and subjected to Poisson-distributed noise. We used the theoretical PSF of the emission wavelength and numerical
aperture, which has a full-width at half-maximum of 0.19
µ m. Because of the occasional presence of lipid matter
in and around the vesicle edge, the radial center-finding
algorithm is weighted with a hyperbolic tangent function centered around the ring of the vesicle so as to only
use the intensity gradient from the edge of the vesicle.
From analysis of simulated images, the radial-symmetrybased localization gives an estimated localization error of
≈ 3 nm. Independently, the localization error estimated
from vesicle trajectories by the method of Vestergaard et
al.[30] is ≈ 10 nm. The vesicle radius is determined by
Hough transformation, as in the bead and droplet image analysis. The estimated uncertainty in R from the
standard deviation of simulated images at the appropriate SNR is ≈ 0.005 µm. More significant, however, is the
standard deviation in R over the course of an image series, due for example to changes in position relative to the
sheet plane. This is ≈ 0.03 µm, which is small compared
to the typical 10 µm vesicle radii and which contributes
negligibly to the overall uncertainty in C. From vesicle
position data, we calculated D and C as described above.

RESULTS

Light sheet fluorescence microscopy provides clear images of lipid vesicles. A typical example is shown in Figure 2(a). Assessment of images as described above provides vesicle positions, radii, diffusion coefficients (D),
and the flow boundary constant (C), along with their
uncertainties. We provide the complete set of positions,
radii, diffusion coefficients, and boundary coefficient values for every microsphere, water droplet, and lipid vesicle
examined as Supplemental File.
In Figure 2(b) we show ten randomly chosen exam-

ples of vesicle mean-squared-displacement(MSD) (colored lines) as a function of lag time together with their
average (dashed gray line). The linearity of the MSD
curve is indicative of free diffusion. A more robust assessment of the Brownian character of vesicle motion comes
from the goodness of fit calculation provided by the covariance based estimator of D, which gives a reduced χ2
value whose value should be ≈ 1 for a model of pure diffusion. A histogram of the measured χ2 values is shown
in Figure 2(c), and is consistent with simple Brownian
diffusion.
As described in Methods, we use measurements of vesicle radii and diffusion coefficients to determine the flow
boundary condition constant C. The histogram of C for
N = 26 vesicles is shown in Figure 2(d). The mean ±
standard error is C = 5.92 ± 0.13. To estimate possible systematic error, we assume that the polystyrene microspheres for which we calculated C (see Methods) are
ideal hard spheres. The standard deviation of the beads’
C value would therefore be the spread inherent in our
methodology. In order to account for this uncertainty we
can compute a systematic standard error by dividing the
standard deviation of the beads’ C by the square root
of the number of vesicles. This gives us a constant for
vesicles of C = 5.92 ± 0.13 (stat.) ± 0.16 (syst.).
Our measurements show that at least over micrometer
length scales and millisecond-to-second timescales, lipid
bilayers are very well described by the no-slip flow boundary conditions that characterize solid surfaces. Perhaps

reassuringly, the standard assumption that is ubiquitous
in treatments of liposome hydrodynamics is well supported. It is perhaps surprising that fluid lipid membranes behave as solid surfaces with respect to flow
through an external liquid, but it is consistent with the
membranes having a large viscosity. Hydrodynamics is
qualitatively different in two and three dimensions, and
two-dimensional viscosity is dimensionally distinct from
its three-dimensional counterpart. Nonetheless, one can
divide the viscosity of a thin two dimensional fluid by its
thickness to give a value that allows rough comparison
to the viscosity of bulk three-dimensional liquids. For a
lipid bilayer, the viscosity is on the order of 10−9 Pa·s·m
[7, 36, 37], and the thickness on the order of 10−9 m, giving a rough effective viscosity ∼ 1 Pa·s, corresponding to
λ ∼ 1000 and C ≈ 6. We caution, however, that a lipid
vesicle does not simply behave as a bulk ∼ 1 Pa·s droplet;
external flow, for example, easily induces stresses in the
thin membrane that generate interior flows [37].
Our method shows that a conceptually simple imagingbased approach can provide precision measurements of
microscale fluid properties. We expect that this can be
extended to, for example, fluctuating membranes driven
by either temperature [26, 38] or active forces [39] to investigate couplings between topography and drag. Also,
one can imagine tuning flow boundary conditions of liquid droplets by controlled addition of lipids or other
surfactants, spanning the range between liquid-like and
solid-like behavior. Finally, we note that the methods
presented here will also be applicable in non-Newtonian
fluids, for which detailed understanding of microscale
rheology continues to be an active area of study.
