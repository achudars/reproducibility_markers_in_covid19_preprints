ABSTRACT

In this paper, the statistical studies on the force-freeness of photosphere magnetic
fields are given. The studies are based on the vector magnetic fields observed by Solar
Optical Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT/SP) on board Hinode. Three parameters
(F x /F p , F y /F p , and F z /F p ) are introduced to investigate the force-freeness of active
regions photosphere magnetic field. Various thresholds and reductions of original resolutions are selected to calculated parameters. As for the resolutions, the reductions
of original resolution data by a factor of 2, 4 and 8 are applied. While for thresholds, they are calculated from individual active region with the average of 75/77/57
G for B x /By /Bz for all original data. When the resolution are reduced by 2, 4 and
8, the corresponding averages are 72/75/55, 66/68/49 and 57/59/41 G for B x /By /Bz ,
respectively. It is found that the forces indicated by F x /F p and F y /F p increase as
thresholds/resolutions increase/decrease. While for F z /F p the trends become more
complex. For low threshold, when the resolution decrease the trends of F z /F p are
similar as those of F x /F p and F y /F p , while for high threshold the trends of F z /F p are
different from those of F x /F p and F y /F p . For original resolution, the forces indicated
by F y /F p increase as thresholds increase, while for others resolution they decrease as
the thresholds increase contrarily.

1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic fields filling the whole active regions are related directly to solar active eruption
events such as filament eruptions, jets, flares and coronal mass ejections. Hence, the knowledge
of magnetic fields is necessary to understand the nature of solar activities. Due to the whole

–3–
space of active regions are filled with magnetic fields, the studies of active regions magnetic fields
should include the information of 3 dimensions magnetic fields of active regions. Up to present,
magnetic fields in the photosphere can be measured with high accuracy and reliability. Magnetic
field measurements in chromosphere and corona are only available for a few cases, due to its
difficulties from both observations and physical theories (Gary & Hurford 1994; Lin et al. 2004).
As a result, the magnetic field extrapolations work as alternative and effective methods to study
the spatial magnetic fields in chromosphere and corona.
The conventional and classical field extrapolations are force-free extrapolations, that assume
magnetic fields above the photosphere are free of Lorentz forces (Aly 1989). This assumption can
be considered to be appropriate for coronal environments, where are filled with the low-β plasma
(here, β is defined as the ratio between plasma and magnetic pressure). Then, the corona magnetic
fields can be reconstructed through force-free extrapolation basing on force-free model and using
photosphere magnetic fields as boundary conditions. Although there are lots of field extrapolations
applications to study spatial magnetic fields of active regions (Wu et al. 1990; Mikic et al. 1994;
Amari et al. 1997; Sakurai 1981; Yan & Sakurai 2000; Wheatland et al. 2000; Wiegelmann
2004; Song et al. 2006; He & Wang 2008; Liu et al. 2011a,b; Wiegelmann et al. 2012), there exist
an inconsistency unavoidably that how the numerical solutions satisfying force-free match the
photosphere magnetic fields that should be not force-free completely. There should be a fact
that the force-free extent of the photosphere magnetic fields may affect the reliability of field
extrapolations at some extent. Recently, some researchers propose various methods to resolve
this inconsistency (Wiegelmann et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2013) as far as possible. Additionally, the
itself magnetic characteristics including force-free extent of magnetic fields in the photosphere are
worth to study and reveal.
Recently, there are some studies about the force-free extent of magnetic fields in the
photosphere are presented, however more accurate conclusions are worth to deliberate still. The

–4–
force-freeness of photosphere magnetic field is firstly studied by Metcalf et al. (1995) basing on
magnetograms observed by Mees Solar Observatory. The changes of net Lorentz force with the
height from the photosphere to low chromosphere are studied. The conclusions given are that
magnetic fields deviate from force-free in the photosphere, while magnetic field become force-free
about 400 km above surface of the photosphere. Moon et al. (2002) concluded that magnetic field
of these active regions do not deviate from force-free too far, their studies basing on magnetograms
observed by the Haleakala Stokes Polarimeter of Mees Solar Observatory. The similar results
as Moon et al. (2002) are given by Tiwari (2012) using high resolution magnetic field obtained
from Solar Optical Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT/SP) aboard Hinode satellite. However,
Liu et al. (2013) gave a statistical study on force-freeness of magnetic field in the Photosphere
using 925 magnetograms observed by the Solar Magnetic Field Telescope located at Huairou
Solar Observing Station, the results show that the extents of unforce-free of photosphere magnetic
field are higher than those drew by Moon et al. (2002); Tiwari (2012). In this paper following
the above studies , the problems about the force-freeness of photosphere magnetic fields are
intensively researched through a relative large data sample with high resolution obtained from
SP/Hinode.
The paper are organized as follows. The observation data and data processing are described in
Section 2. The results obtained are shown in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, the brief conclusions
and summaries are given.

2. OBSERVATIONS DATA
In this paper observations data obtained by the Spectro-polarimeter (SP) aboard Hinode
(Kosugi et al. 2007) are used. For SP magnetic field observations, there are two magnetically
sensitive Fe lines of 630.15 and 630.25 are employed, When SP observing, it work at the center
of those two lines or nearby continuum. SP through the slit scan to combine and generate

–5–
Stokes IQUV spectral images. The magnetic and thermodynamic parameters contained in
observations are inverted from full Stokes lines profiles basing on Milne-Eddington (ME)
atmospheric model. The vector magnetograms used in this paper are downloaded from CSAC site
(http://www.csac.hao.ucar.edu/). After the inversion, the normal level2 data contains 36 magnetic
and thermodynamic parameters, of which the field strength B, the inclination angle γ and the
azimuth angle φ are used to create magnetograms. The longitudinal magnetic field component can
be obtained with the formula Bcos(γ), while the transverse field can be calculated from expression
Bsin(γ). The acute angle method (Wang et al. 1994; Wang 1997; Metcalf et al. 2006) is employed
to resolve transverse field 180◦ ambiguity.
The data sample used in this work are observed from November 2006 to June 2012, during
this period about 600 active regions appeared on the sun, but a part of active regions were not
observed by SP/Hinode. In this study, the active regions with the longitude and latitude less than
40 degree are chosen. Additionally, for multi-observations that taken on the same active region,
the magnetograms that is closest to the center of disk are selected. The data sample is extend from
Hao & Zhang (2011) with the same selection criteria. The field of view for each magnetogram
keeps original one that observed by SP/Hinode, and the resolution is 0.16/0.32 arcsec/pixel for the
normal/fast modes observed magnetograms. To avoid the projection effects, the vector magnetic
fields are transformed to local heliographic coordinates, then the magnetic components (B x ,By and
Bz ) are generated for this study.

RESULTS

Following the previous studies (Metcalf et al. 1995; Moon et al. 2002; Tiwari 2012; Liu et al.
2013), three parameters of F x /F p , F y /F p , and F z /F p expressed as follows are used to study the

Here, the assumption is that the magnetic field filling in half space above the photosphere decrease
very fast when z increases, it will vanish when z goes infinite. Equations (1)-(3) due to the
balance between net Lorentz force in the infinite half-space (z>0) and Maxwell stress integrated
on surface (z=0). While F p indicates the magnitude of total Lorentz force. Molodenskii (1967)
also illustrated some basic integral relations about the criteria for the force-free character of active
region magnetic field. Flux balance of active regions is important for the force-free conditions
(1-3), so in this work the requirement FluxDevi. (Eq.5) less than 0.2 is added. At last 112 active
regions are selected as data sample to be investigated.
Low (1985) suggest that if all three Lorentz force components are much less than F p , then it
can give a force-free field. So, the magnitude of F x /F p , F y /F p , and F z /F p can role as a criterion
to measure the force-free extent of magnetic field at the boundary of the photosphere z = 0.
Metcalf et al. (1995) suggested that if F z /F p is equal to or less than 0.1 (F z /F p ≤ 0.1) then
the magnetic field of photosphere can be regarded as force-free completely. Moon et al. (2002)
analysed 12 magnetograms, of which the mean and median values of F z /F p are -0.17 and -0.13,
respectively, and concluded that the magnetic field of photosphere is not so far from force-free.
Tiwari (2012) analysed high resolution vector magnetograms of 19 active regions observed by

–7–
SOT/SP, of which the mean and median values of F z /F p are -0.23 and -0.22, respectively, and it is
suggest that the magnetic field of photosphere do not deviate force-free case too much.
Figure 1 shows the probability density function (PDF) of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p for
the selected active regions magnetograms. To avoid the effects of data noise, here magnetic
component B x , By and Bz values greater than some certain threshold are calculated and presented,
respectively. These thresholds are determined by the different levels of data noise, the 1σ, 2σ
and 3σ deviations of each magnetic components are used as different thresholds. For each
magnetogram, σ deviation is calculated using quiet regions in individual active region, and quiet
regions are around but not closed to the main sunspot.Figure 2 gives an example of active region
to show how the quiet regions are selected, firstly, the individual σ is calculated for each quiet
region labeled by 1, 2, 3 et al., then the average of σs for all selected quiet regions is regarded as
threshold used in this active region. For different active region the number of quiet regions maybe
different, which ranges from 3 to 6 basing on distributions of active region magnetic field. Only
pixels with B x , By and Bz simultaneously greater than 1σ (2σ, 3σ) deviations are calculated to
get the values of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p . In figure 1, the first row shows the PDF distributions
of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p that are computed from all pixels of magnetic components of
B x , By and Bz , it means there is no threshold used in the calculations. The second, third and
fourth rows show the PDF distributions of of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p , which are calculated
using 1σ, 2σ and 3σ deviations as thresholds for each magnetic components, respectively. In
each plot, the median of those parameters of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p , the average of absolute
value (< |F i |/F p >, i = x, y, z) of those parameters are shown, additionally, the percentages of
those parameters for two cases, which are the corresponding parameters (F x /F p , F y /F p and
F z /F p ) are less than 0.1 and 0.2, are given to get a relative quantitative results. It is found that
F x /F p and F y /F p increase as the thresholds increase evidently, while the changes of F z /F p are
very faint. For F x /F p , the percentage of active region magnetic field regarded as force-free
sufficiently (F x /F p < 0.1) decrease from 80% (threshold=0) to 50% (threshold=3σ); For F y /F p

–8–
the percentage decrease from 53% (threshold=0) to 7% (threshold=3σ); For F z /F p dissimilarly,
this percentage almost do not change. If it is assumed that the magnetic field can be regarded as
not far from force-free model, when F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p less than 0.2. Then, for F x /F p and
F y /F p , the percentage of active region magnetic field regarded as not far from force-free decrease
from 100%/98% (threshold=0) to 86%/50% (threshold=3σ), while for F z /F p the corresponding
percentage changes faintly.
To see the effects of observations resolutions on those parameters of F x /F p , F y /F p and
F z /F p , the original resolutions of observations are reduced by three different factors of 2, 4 and 8,
then the values of those parameters are calculated for different thresholds cases individually. The
thresholds maybe affected by reduction of resolutions at some extent, which are illuminated by
Figures 3 for all active regions, it gives the changes of σs of B x , By , Bz with different resolutions,
which are reduced by factors of 2, 4 and 8 (labeled by F=2, 4 and 8). It can be found that the
thresholds become smaller as the decreases of resolutions. Additionally, from its distributions it
can be found that the amplitudes of decrease are basically consistent for all active regions. At
the same time Figure 4 gives the changes of σs values with the variation of resolutions using
Figure 2 as an example, here σs of B x , By , Bz are indicated by the black, yellow and blue dots,
five dots in each panel correspond five quiet regions selected and labeled in Figure2, same as
Figure 3 the resolutions reduced by three different factors of 2, 4 and 8, are labeled by F=2, 4
and 8, respectively. From Figure 3 and Figure 4 it can be found that on the whole the amplitudes
of changes with the reduction of resolutions are consistencies. Figure 5 shows values of F x /F p ,
F y /F p and F z /F p calculated for the case using 0 as threshold. Here the rows 1, 2 and 3 present the
results based on the reduced original resolutions of observations by a factor of 2, 4 and 8. The
same as Fig 1, the averages, the median values and the percentages of two cases described same
as Fig 1 are given in each plot. From Fig 5, it can be found that F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p become
large as the decrease of resolutions on the whole, but the changes of these parameters are not very
evident. It means that the resolutions effects on the values of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p is very

–9–
faint when using 0 as the threshold.
The same as Fig 5, Fig 6, 7 and 8 show the distributions of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p using
1σ, 2σ and 3σ as thresholds, respectively. For 1σ, the results show the similar trend as using
0 as threshold, but the changes of F z /F p become week. For 2σ and 3σ, on the whole it can be
found that the values of F x /F p , F y /F p become large as the resolutions decrease, while the values
of F z /F p become small when the resolutions decrease.
From Fig 5, Fig 6, 7 and 8, it can be found that the threshold used and grid resolution
have effects on the results at some extent. So in Fig 9 and 10 the average values and standard
deviation of |F x |/F p , |F y |/F p and |F z |/F p vs the thresholds and grid resolutions are given. From
this two figures, it can be found that the amplitude of |F x |/F p and |F y |/F p increase as the
the increases/decreases of thresholds/resolutions. As for |F z |/F p , the situations become more
complex: 1. When the small thresholds used (threshold=0 and threshold=1σ) the amplitudes
of |F z |/F p increase with the decrase of resolutions, while for the high thresholds (threshold=2σ
and threshold=3σ) they reverse; 2. On the whole, the amplitudes of |F z |/F p decrease with the
increases of thresholds used.
To see the relations between |F x |/F p , |F y |/F p and |F z |/F p and the magnetic field strength,
Fig 11 shows |F x |/F p , |F y |/F p and |F z |/F p versus the magnetic components of B x , By , Bz , the
q
transverse field (Bt = B2x + B2y ), total field strength B, magnetic azimuths (φ=atan(By /B x )) and
magnetic inclination angles (θ=atan(Bz /Bt )) for using 2σ data deviations as the threshold, where
B x , By and Bz are the average of their absolute values and the correlation coefficients between two
physical quantities in each panel are given correspondingly. In Fig 11 the conclusions can be
given as follows: 1. From the plot a it can be found that the amplitudes of |F x |/F p increase as B x
increase; 2. From the plot b it can be found that the amplitudes of |F y |/F p decrease as By increase;
3. From the plot c, f and i it can be found that the values of |F z |/F p increase as B x , By and Bt
increase, repectively; 4. From the plot p it can be found that the amplitudes of |F x |/F p decrease as

– 10 –
magnetic azimuths (φ) increase; 5. From the plot q it can be found that the amplitudes of |F y |/F p
increase as magnetic azimuths (φ) increase; 6. From the plot u it can be found that the values
of F z /F p decrease evidently as magnetic inclination angles (θ) increase. 7. There is no evident
correlation between |F x |/F p , |F y |/F p and |F z |/F p and magnetic component can be revealed in the
other plot. When other thresholds used in calculation, the relations between those parameters and
magnetic components have the same trends.

4. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The force-free properties of photosphere magnetic field can give the force-free coronal field
extrapolations important references in practice. In the applications of coronal force-free field
extrapolations, the magnetic fields of photosphere that probably deviate force-free properties more
or less should be regarded as force-free field. Hence, the force-freeness of photosphere magnetic
field is worth to be studied enough to make the coronal force-free field models more reasonable.
In this paper, the force-freeness of photosphere magnetic field is studied statistically using
active regions magnetograms observed by SP/Hinode. Three parameters of F x /F p , F y /F p and
F z /F p defined in the equations (2)-(5) are used to inspect the extent of photosphere magnetic
field. If the amplitudes of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p less than 0.1 the magnetic field can regard
as sufficiently force-free according to Metcalf et al. (1995), and this criterion is also used in this
paper to research the force-freeness of photosphere magnetic field. The previous results from
Moon et al. (2002), it give the mean amplitudes and median of F x /F p are 0.04 and 0.01, for F y /F p
they are 0.07 and -0.03, for F z /F p they are -0.17 and 0.13. The results of Tiwari (2012) give the
mean amplitudes and median of F x /F p are 0.11 and 0.05, for F y /F p they are 0.09 and -0.09, for
F z /F p they are 0.23 and -0.22. In this paper, the mean amplitudes and median of F x /F p are 0.075
and 0.021, for F y /F p they are 0.126 and 0.051, for F z /F p they are 0.172 and -0.112, here the
results are calculated using 1σ data noise level as the threshold which case is the same as Tiwari

– 11 –
(2012). It can be found that the amplitudes of F z /F p are greater than those of F x /F p and F y /F p
on the whole, therefore the main attentions are paid to F z /F p to study the force-free extent of
photosphere magnetic field in previous researches.
The resolutions of magnetic field observations are always regarded as an important effect
which may affect the integration values of those parameters, hence the results calculated from
various resolutions are revealed, here the different resolutions are carried out by reducing the
resolutions of SP observations. It is found that the amplitude of F x /F p and F y /F p become large
as the resolutions decrease, while the amplitudes of F z /F p tend to be small as the resolutions
decrease for the cases when the threshold are 2σ and 3σ data noise levels. The previous
relative studies all based on the observations with the resolutions that is lower than those of SP
observations, additionally, the amplitudes of F x /F p and F y /F p are all smaller than those of F z /F p
in the previous studies. So at some extent the photosphere magnetic field maybe more force-free
in the previous studies than in this study based on high resolutions observations. For the case that
there is no threshold used (namely, threshold=0), the amplitudes of of F x /F p , F y /F p and F z /F p all
become large, however the amplitudes of change are smaller than those of other thresholds used.
It is noticed that it maybe not a reasonable data process when there is no threshold are used in data
analysis. From the Fig 9, it can be found that as the resolution increases the forces indicated by
F z /F p can also increase, it further illustrate the previous studies used low resolution data maybe
more inclined to force-free at some extent. Through calculations, it can be found that F x /F p ,
F y /F p and F z /F p exhibited some complex situations when different thresholds and resolutions
are selected. The reason maybe due to the changes amplitudes of different magnetic components
(B x , By and Bz ), through analysis it is found that the change trends of magnetic components is
consistent, but there exist some small fluctuations for each magnetic component when difference
thresholds and resolutions are used, however there is no special regularity can be drawn.
The relationships between the parameters of |F x |/F p , |F y |/F p and |F z |/F p and magnetic

– 12 –
components are researched in this paper, here the magnetic components include B x , By , Bz , Bt , B,
azimuths φ and inclination angle θ. On the whole it can be seen that the amplitudes of |F x |/F p and
|F y |/F p depend on azimuths φ with the correlation coefficient of -0.57 and 0.76 (φ related to the
relationships between B x and By components), respectively, which are indicated in the plots of p
and q in Fig 11. It can be found that the amplitudes of |F z |/F p depend on the magnetic inclination
angles evidently, which can be seen from the plot of u in Fig 11 with the correlation coefficient
of 0.89. It can also be found that|F z |/F p and B x , By and Bt have some relations the correlation
coefficient of -0.74, -0.80 and -0.85. The relations between the amplitudes of |F x |/F p , |F y |/F p
and |F z |/F p and magnetic component of Bz are very weak. It should be noted that the magnetic
components of B x and By are the part of Bt , and high correlation coefficient (between |F x |/F p ,
|F y |/F p and |F z |/F p and magnetic components) are more inclined to B x and By . Hence it reflect
indirectly a fact in this data samples that the transverse field play more important roles than that
of longitudinal field to determine the values of those parameters, however it should keep in mind
that the above rules (transverse field play important roles) are probably data dependent.
