Introduction

In this paper we consider the mathematical model for two dimensional miscible liquids
and provide a result on existence and uniqueness of weak solution under a nonmonotone slip boundary condition. The model is a system of partial diﬀerential equations
which consists of Navier-Stokes equations with Korteweg stress terms for the velocity
and pressure of the ﬂuid coupled with the reaction-diﬀusion equation for the concentration of the ﬂuid.
Miscibility is the property of substances to fully dissolve in each other at any concentration forming a homogeneous solution. This notion is mostly applied to liquids,
but applies also to solids and gases. Two liquids are miscible if the molecules of the
one liquid can mix freely with the molecules of the other liquid forming a uniform
blend. For historical reasons the substance less abundant in the mixture is called a
solute, while the most abundant one a solvent. There is no sharp interface between
miscible liquids, but rather a transition zone. Examples of such phenomenon is the
mixing of water and glycerin, and water and ethanol. The study of miscible liquids
is motivated by problems in oil recovery, hydrology, polymer blends, groundwater
pollution and ﬁltration [1, 2, 3, 6, 15].
It was experimentally conﬁrmed that between two miscible liquids there exists a
transient capillary phenomena since the change of concentration gradients near the
transition zone causes capillary forces between two liquids, see [5]. For this reason due
to the concentration inhomogeneities, we need to take into account additional terms
in the equation of motion. These terms introduced ﬁrst in the work by Korteweg [14]
represent additional volume forces in the equations of motion called now Korteweg
stresses.
Results on the unique weak solvability of models describing miscible liquids can
be found [1, 15] where the problem was studied in two dimensional case, in the
absence of external and source forces, with no subdiﬀerential boundary conditions,
and in [2, 3] who treated the three dimensional case with the homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition on the whole boundary. A result on existence of the global weak
solution for a multiphasic incompressible ﬂuid model with Korteweg stress can be
found in [8] where the Galerkin method combined with a ﬁxed point argument have
been employed.
The remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall some preliminary
material and the functional setup of the problem. The classical and variational formulations of a model of miscible liquids are described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.
Section 5 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 8 which is the main result of the paper
on existence and uniqueness of weak solution to the model.

Notation and preliminaries

In this section we introduce notation and recall some preliminary material.
Let Ω be a bounded open subset of R2 with boundary Γ of class C 2 composed
of two disjoint measurable parts Γ0 and Γ1 , i.e., Γ0 ∪ Γ1 = Γ and Γ0 ∩ Γ1 = ∅ with
2

meas (Γ0 ) > 0. Given a vector ξ ∈ R2 on the boundary Γ, we denote by ξν and ξτ
its normal and tangential components, respectively, i.e., ξν = ξ · ν and ξτ = ξ − ξν ν,
where ν denotes the outward normal unit vector to the boundary. The notation S2
represents the class of second order symmetric 2 × 2 tensors. The inner products and
norms in R2 and S2 are denoted by
u · v = ui vi ,

kvk = (v · v)1/2

for all u = (ui ), v = (vi ) ∈ R2 ,

σ : τ = σij τij ,

kτ k = (τ : τ )1/2

for all σ = (σij ), τ = (τij ) ∈ S2 ,

respectively. We introduce the following function spaces
E = { v ∈ H 1 (Ω)2 | v = 0 on Γ0 , vν = 0 on Γ1 , div v = 0 },
H = { v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 | v = 0 on Γ0 , vν = 0 on Γ1 , div v = 0 },
V = { v ∈ H 2 (Ω) |

∂v
= 0 }.
∂ν

We denote by X ∗ the dual space to a Banach space X. The notation
div v = ∇ · v = vi,i ,

Div σ = ∇ · σ = σij,j

stand for the divergence operators of the vector ﬁeld v ∈ L2 (Ω)2 and of the tensor
ﬁeld σ ∈ L2 (Ω, Sd ). An index that follows a comma indicates a derivative with respect
to the corresponding component of the variable, and the summation convention over
repeated indices is used. For the scalar ﬁeld C ∈ H 1 (Ω), its gradient is denoted by
∇C = (C,1 , C,2) and if C ∈ H 2(Ω) its conormal derivative is deﬁned by
∂C
= ∇C · ν.
∂ν
Recall, see [18, Theorem 2.15], that the embedding i : E → H 1−δ (Ω)2 is compact
for δ ∈ (0, 21 ). By γ1 : H 1−δ (Ω)2 → L2 (Γ)2 , we denote the trace operator, which
is known to be continuous, see [18, Theorem 2.21]. Hence, the trace operator γ =
γ1 i : E → L2 (Γ)2 is compact. In what follows, the norm of γ in L(E, L2 (Γ)2 ) (the
space of linear and bounded operators from E into L2 (Γ)2 ) is denoted by kγk, and
instead of γv, we often write simply v. We will also use the following special case of
the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality, proof of which can be found in [10,
Theorem 10.1].
Lemma 1. If Ω ⊂ R2 is a domain with C 1 boundary, then there exists a constant
M > 0 such that
1/2

1/2

kukL4(Ω) ≤ MkukL2 (Ω) kukH 1 (Ω) for all u ∈ H 1 (Ω).
For a ﬁnite number T > 0, we introduce the Bochner-Lebesque spaces
E = { v ∈ L2 (0, T ; E) | v ′ ∈ L2 (0, T ; E ∗ ) }
3

and
W = { C ∈ L2 (0, T ; V ) | C ′ ∈ L2 (0, T ; V ∗ ) },
where v ′ and C ′ denote the time derivatives in the sense of distributions.
We recall two useful results on evolution triples, proofs of which can by found
in [21, Lemma 2.1] and [19, Corollary 4], respectively.
Lemma 2 (Erhling). Let X, Y and Z be Banach spaces such that X is compactly
embedded in Y , and Y is continuously embedded in Z. Then, for every ε > 0, there
exists a constant C(ε) > 0 such that
kxkY ≤ ε kxkX + C(ε) kxkZ for all x ∈ X.
Lemma 3 (Aubin-Lions). Let X, Y and Z be reflexive Banach spaces and X ⊂ Y ⊂ Z
continuously with compact embedding X ⊂ Y , and p, q ∈ (1, ∞). Then, for any T > 0,
the space
{ u ∈ Lp (0, T ; X) | u′ ∈ Lq (0, T ; Z) }
is compactly embedded into Lp (0, T ; Y ).
In what follows, we denote by h·, ·iX ∗×X the duality pairing between a Banach
space X and its dual.
We recall the deﬁnitions of the generalized directional derivative and the generalized gradient of Clarke for a locally Lipschitz function ϕ : X → R, where X is a
Banach space, see [9]. The generalized directional derivative of ϕ at x ∈ X in the
direction v ∈ X, denoted by ϕ0 (x; v), is deﬁned by
ϕ(y + λv) − ϕ(y)
.
λ
λ↓0

ϕ0 (x; v) = lim sup
y→x,

The generalized gradient of ϕ at x, denoted by ∂ϕ(x), is a subset of a dual space X ∗
given by
∂ϕ(x) = { ζ ∈ X ∗ | ϕ0 (x; v) ≥ hζ, viX ∗ ×X for all v ∈ X }.
Finally, we recall the Green formula, proof of which can be found in e.g. [18,
Theorem 2.25].
Lemma 4. Let Ω be an bounded domain in Rd , d = 2, 3 with Lipschitz boundary.
Then, the following formula holds

Throughout the paper, we denote by M a generic constant whose value may change
from line to line.

Classical formulation

In this section we provide the classical formulation of a model for miscible liquids
which describe evolution of the velocity u : Ω×(0, T ) → R2 , pressure p : Ω×(0, T ) → R
and concentration C : Ω × (0, T ) → R of a viscous incompressible ﬂuid ﬁlling domain
Ω with the time interval (0, T ).
The model consists with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation modiﬁed by
the (additional) Korteweg tensor. The classical stress tensor σ for incompressible
ﬂuids is given by
σ = −p I + 2 ν0 ε(u) in Ω × (0, T ),
(1)
where I denotes the identity matrix and ν0 is the kinetic viscosity coeﬃcient. We
suppose that the ﬂuid is incompressible
div u = 0 in Ω × (0, T ),

(2)

and governed by the Navier-Stokes equation for miscible ﬂuids
∂u
− ν0 ∆u + (u · ∇)u + ∇p = Div K(C) + f in Ω × (0, T ),
∂t

(3)

where f : Ω × (0, T ) → R2 denotes external forces ﬁeld such as gravity and buoyancy,
and K(C) = (Kij (C)) is the Korteweg stress tensor given by the following relations
K11 (C) = k

∂C ∂C

∂x2 ∂x2
∂x1 ∂x1
∂x1 ∂x2

(4)

where k is a nonnegative constant.
We use a concentration function C to represent and track the interface between
liquids. The concentration function is transported by the velocity ﬁeld u
∂C
− d ∆C + u · ∇C = g C in Ω × (0, T ),
∂t

(5)

where d > 0 is the coeﬃcient of mass diﬀusion and g represents the source term. We
assume also the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditon on the boundary Γ for
the concentration function
∂C
= 0 on Γ × (0, T ).
∂ν

(6)

We supplement the system with boundary and initial conditions. On the part Γ0 , we
suppose adhesive boundary condition
u = 0 on Γ0 × (0, T ).

(7)

The following nonmonotone slip boundary condtion of frictional type with no leak is
assumed on the part Γ1
uν = 0,

−στ ∈ ∂j(uτ ) on Γ1 × (0, T ),
5

(8)

where ∂j denotes the generalized gradient of a prescibed locally Lipschitz function j.
The boundary friction law (8) has been considered for the Navier-Stokes problems
in [16, 13, 17, 20]. Finally, the initial conditions for the velocity and concentration
are prescibed
u(0) = u0 , C(0) = C0 in Ω.
(9)
The classical formulation of the problem for miscible liquids is the following.
Problem 5. Find u : Ω × (0, T ) → R2 , p : Ω × (0, T ) → R and C : Ω × (0, T ) → R
such that (4)–(9) are satisfied.
In the next section we will study the weak formulation of Problem 5.
We conclude this section with remarks on the Korteweg stress tensor which will
be useful in next sections. Using the notation

Variational formulation

In this section we provide a variational formulation of Problem 5 and state the main
result of this paper.
We start by introducing the following forms and formulating their properties. The
bilinear forms a0 : H 1 (Ω)2 × H 1 (Ω)2 → R, b0 : H 1 (Ω) × H 1 (Ω) → R and c : H 1 (Ω)2 ×
L2 (Ω) → R are given by

Ω

We also deﬁne the trilinear forms a1 : H 1 (Ω)2 ×H 1 (Ω)2 ×H 1 (Ω)2 → R and b1 : H 1 (Ω)2 ×
H 1 (Ω) × H 1 (Ω) → R by
Z

Ω

b1 (v, ξ, η) =

Z

(v · ∇ξ) η dx for v ∈ H 1 (Ω)2 , ξ, η ∈ H 1 (Ω).

There exists α = 21 ν0 Mk > 0 , where Mk is a constant arising from Korn inequality,
such that
a0 (u, u) ≥ α kuk2E , b0 (ξ, ξ) = d k∇ξk2L2(Ω)
(12)
for all u ∈ H 1 (Ω)2 and ξ ∈ H 1 (Ω). Also, by the deﬁnition of space E, we have
c(v, q) = 0 for v ∈ E, q ∈ L2 (Ω).

(13)

Moreover, we recall the properties of forms a1 and b1 . They follow from Lemma 1 and
Lemma 1.3(II) in [21].
Lemma 6. (a) For all u, v, w ∈ E, we have
a1 (u, v, w) = −a1 (u, w, v),

Furthermore, we introduce operators A0 , A1 : E → E ∗ , B0 : V → V ∗ and B1 : E ×
V → V ∗ deﬁned by
hA0 u, viE ∗×E = a0 (u, v),

hA1 u, viE ∗×E = a1 (u, u, v) for u, v ∈ E,

hB0 C, ηiV ∗ ×V = b0 (C, η),

hB1 (u, C), ηiV ∗ ×V = b1 (u, C, η) for u ∈ E, C, η ∈ V.

Assume now that u, p and C are suﬃciently smooth functions which solve Problem 5. Let v ∈ E be suﬃciently smooth and t ∈ (0, T ). Using the Green formula
of Lemma 4, combined with the deﬁnition of (1), similarly as in [20], we obtain the
following equality

We now multiply (3) by v ∈ E. Exploiting deﬁnitions of operators A0 , A1 , using (13)
and (14) we deduce

Γ

= hDiv K(C), viE ∗ ×E + hf (t), viE ∗ ×E .

(15)

Next, we use the orthogonality relation σν · v = σν vν + στ · vτ = στ · vτ and (8) to
arrive at the equality
hu′(t) + A0 u(t) + A1 u(t), viE ∗×E + hξ(t), viL2(Γ1 )2 = hDiv K(C(t)) + f (t), viE ∗×E , (16)
where ξ ∈ L2 (0, T ; L2(Γ1 )2 ), ξ(t) ∈ ∂j(uτ (t)) for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). On the other hand,
we multiply (5) by η ∈ V , using (6) we ﬁnd
hC ′ (t) + B0 C(t) + B1 (u(t), C(t)), ηiV ∗ ×V = hg C(t), ηiL2 (Ω) .

(17)

Summarizing, we obtain the following system of equations and inclusion which is
the variational formulation of Problem 5.
Problem 7. Find u ∈ E and C ∈ W such that there exists ξ ∈ L2 (0, T ; L2 (Γ1 )2 ) and
hu′ (t) + A0 u(t) + A1 u(t), viE ∗×E + hξ(t), viL2(Γ1 )2
= hDiv K(C(t)) + f (t), viE ∗×E for all v ∈ E, a.e. t ∈ (0, T ),
ξ(t) ∈ ∂j(uτ (t)) for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ),
hC ′ (t) + B0 C(t) + B1 (u(t), C(t)), ηiV ∗ ×V = hg C(t), ηiL2(Ω)
for all η ∈ V, a.e. t ∈ (0, T ),
u(0) = u0 , C(0) = C0 .

We need the following hypotheses.
H(j) : j : Γ1 × R2 → R is such that
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

j(·, ξ) is measurable for all ξ ∈ R2 , j(·, 0) ∈ L2 (Γ1 ),
j(x, ·) is locally Lipschitz for a.e. x ∈ Γ1 ,
η · s ≥ 0 for all η ∈ ∂j(x, s), s ∈ R2 , a.e. x ∈ Γ1 ,
kζk ≤ m0 (1 + kξk) for all ξ ∈ R2 , ζ ∈ ∂j(x, ξ), a.e x ∈ Γ1 with m0 > 0,
(ζ1 − ζ2 ) · (ξ1 − ξ2 ) ≥ −m1 kξ1 − ξ2 k2 for all ζi ∈ ∂j(x, ξi ), ξi ∈ R2 ,
i = 1, 2, a.e. x ∈ Γ1 with m1 ≥ 0.

(H0 ): d, k, ν0 > 0, g ∈ L∞ (Ω), g ≥ 0, f ∈ L2 (0, T ; E ∗), u0 ∈ E, C0 ∈ V .
Our main result of this paper on a unique solvability of Problem 7 reads as follows.
Theorem 8. Under hypotheses H(j)(a)–(d) and (H0 ), Problem 7 has a solution
such that C ∈ L∞ (0, T ; H 1(Ω)). If, in addition, H(j)(e) holds, then the solution to
Problem 7 is unique.

Proof of the main result

In this section we provide the proof of Theorem 8. For the existence, we use the regularized Galerkin method. To this end, we deﬁne the regularization of the mulitivalued
term as follows.
∞

such that ρ ≥ 0 on R2 , supp ρ ⊂ [−1, 1]2 and
R Let ρ ∈ C0 (R ) be the molliﬁer
ρ dx = 1. We deﬁne ρm (x) = m2 ρ(mx) for m ∈ N. Then supp ρm ⊂ [− m1 , m1 ]2 for
R2
all m ∈ N. Consider functions jm : Γ1 × R2 → R deﬁned by
Z
ρm (z)j(x, ξ − z) dz for (x, ξ) ∈ Γ1 × R2 .
jm (x, ξ) =
supp ρm

We observe that since jm (x, ·) ∈ C ∞ (R2 ) for all x ∈ Γ1 , therefore ∂jm (x, ξ) reduces
to a single element. We write ∂jm (x, ξ(t)) = {Du jm (x, ξ(t))} for all ξ(t) ∈ E, where
Du jm represents the derivative of jm (x, ·). Moreover, it is easy to see that jm satisﬁes
the growth condition H(j)(d).
Using the separability of the space E, we may write a basis of E as {ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . .}. We
choose in V a special basis {ψ1 , ψ2 , . . .} of eigenvectors of the −∆ eigenvalue problem
associated with zero Neumann boundary condition, see [11, Theorem 6.1.31].
We deﬁne ﬁnite dimensional subspaces E m = span{ϕ1 , . . . , ϕm } of E, and V m =
span{ψ1 , . . . , ψm } of V for m ≥ 1. Let u0m , C0m be such that u0m → u0 in H and
C0m → C0 in L2 (Ω) with u0m ∈ E m and C0m ∈ V m for m ≥ 1. Next, for a ﬁxed
m ≥ 1, consider the following problem in ﬁnite dimensional spaces.
Problem 9. Find um ∈ L2 (0, T ; E m ) with u′m ∈ L2 (0, T ; E m) and Cm ∈ L2 (0, T ; V m )

(19)

um (0) = u0m , Cm (0) = C0m .
We introduce the new variable zm (t) = (um (t), Cm (t)) and the space Y m = E m × V m ,
′
and rewrite Probem 9 as follows: ﬁnd zm ∈ L2 (0, T ; Y m ) with zm
∈ L2 (0, T ; Y m ) such
that zm (0) = (u0m , C0m ) and
′
hzm

Solvability of the problem (20) on a small time interval (0, T1 ) follows from the
Carathéodory existence theorem. We now show a priori estimates to extend the solution on the whole interval (0, T ). First, we test equation (19) with ηm = Cm (t) and
observe that from Lemma 6(b), we have b0 (um (t), Cm (t), Cm (t)) = 0 for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).
Hence, we obtain

Using the Gronwall lemma, from the last inequality, we deduce that
kCm kL∞ (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) ≤ M

(23)

and putting (23) in (22), we obtain
kCm kL2 (0,T ;H 1 (Ω)) ≤ M.

(24)

Now, we take vm = um (t) in equality (18). Using coercivity of A0 stated in (12),
condition H(j)(d) and Lemma 6(a), we ﬁnd

2 dt
+ h∆Cm (t)∇Cm (t), um (t)iL2 (Ω)2 + ε kum(t)k2V + M

(26)

for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). From Lemma 2, there exists M(ε) > 0 such that
kum (t)k2L2 (Γ1 ) ≤ 2 ε kumk2E + M(ε) kum (t)k2H .
Using this inequality in (26), we have
1d
kum (t)k2H + (α − 3ε)kum(t)k2E

(27)

Subsequently, we take ηm = −k ∆Cm (t) in (19) to ﬁnd

2 dt
−k h∆Cm (t), ∇Cm (t)um (t)iL2 (Ω) ≤ k kgkk∇Cm(t)k2L2 (Ω)2 .

(28)

Next, adding (27) and (28), we get

(29)

Choosing ε > 0 suﬃciently small, integrating (29) over (0, t) for t ∈ (0, T ), from the
Gronwall lemma, we deduce
kum kL∞ (0,T ;H) ≤ M,

(30)

kum kL2 (0,T ;E) ≤ M,

where (33) holds due to [12, Theorem 3.1.2.3]. Now, we estimate kCm

(35)

Next, we estimate the term Div K(Cm ). We observe that

where aijk are constants for i, j, k = 1, 2 and Dl =

From bounds (30)–(33), (36) and (37), we have
k Div K(Cm )kL2 (0,T ;E ∗ ) ≤ M.

(38)

Furthermore, from (24), (30)–(33) and (35), we ﬁnd elements u ∈ L∞ (0, T ; H) ∩
L2 (0, T ; E) and C ∈ L∞ (0, T ; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2 (0, T ; H 2(Ω)) such that, up to a subsequence, we get
um → u weakly∗ in L∞ (0, T ; H),

(39)

um → u weakly in L2 (0, T ; E),

(40)

Cm → C weakly∗ in L∞ (0, T ; H 1(Ω)),

(41)

Cm → C weakly in L2 (0, T ; V ),

(42)

as m → ∞. By the deﬁnition of operator A1 and [21, Lemma 3.4], we have
kA1 (um )kL2 (0,T ;E ∗ ) ≤ Mkum kL∞ (0,T ;H) kum kL2 (0,T ;E) .

(43)

From (30), (31), (38), (43) and the deﬁnition of operator A0 , we infer that
ku′m kL2 (0,T ;E ∗ ) ≤ M,

(44)

u′m → u′ weakly in L2 (0, T ; E ∗ ), as m → ∞.

(45)

and hence
By Lemma 3, we know that the embedding E ⊂ L2 (0, T ; H) is compact, so from (31)
and (44), we have
um → u in L2 (0, T ; H), as m → ∞.
(46)
12

Since the operator A0 : E → E ∗ is linear and continuous, so is its Nemytskii operator
which is denoted in the same way. Therefore, we ﬁnd that
A0 um → A0 u weakly in L2 (0, T ; E ∗), as m → ∞.

(47)

From (30) and (31) and the technique used in [21, Lemma III.3.2], we have
A1 (um ) → A1 (u) weakly in L2 (0, T ; E ∗), as m → ∞.

(48)

We use the fact that the embedding W ⊂ L2 (0, T ; H 1(Ω)) is compact. From (35),
(24) and Lemma 3, we deduce
Cm → C in L2 (0, T ; H 1(Ω)), as m → ∞.

(49)

Moreover, from (38) and (49), we see that
Div K(Cm ) → Div K(C) weakly in L2 (0, T ; E ∗), as m → ∞.

(50)

Next, by the compactness of the trace operator from E to L2 (0, T ; L2(Γ1 )2 ), it
follows
umτ → uτ in L2 (0, T ; L2(Γ1 )2 ), as m → ∞.
Hence, by passing to a next subsequence, if necessary, we have
umτ (t) → uτ (t) in L2 (Γ1 )2 for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ), as m → ∞.

(51)

On the other hand, by hypothesis H(j)(d) and (31), we may suppose that
Djm (umτ (·)) → ξ weakly in L2 (0, T ; L2(Γ1 )2 ), as m → ∞

(52)

with ξ ∈ L2 (0, T ; L2 (Γ1 )2 ). Now, we are in a position to use convergences (51) and
(52), and apply the Aubin-Cellina convergence theorem, see [4, Theorem 1, p.60] to
the inclusion
Djm (umτ (t)) ∈ ∂jm (umτ (t)) for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).
We deduce that
ξ(t) ∈ co ∂j(uτ (t)) = ∂j(uτ (t)) for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ),
where co denotes the closure of the convex hull of a set. The last equality follows
from the fact that the values of the generalized subgradient are closed and convex
sets, see [18, Proposition 3.23].
In a similar way, as in (47), by linearity and continuity of operator B0 , by using
(49), we have
B0 Cm → B0 C weakly in L2 (0, T ; V ∗ ), as m → ∞.

(53)

Also, from (46) and (49), we obtain
B1 (um , Cm ) → B1 (u, C) weakly in L2 (0, T ; V ∗ ), as m → ∞.
13

(54)

From (35) we infer that
′
Cm
→ C weakly in L2 (0, T ; L2(Ω)).

(55)

Thus, using convergences (45), (47), (48), (50) and (52), we pass to the limit in (18)
and using standard techniques, see [17, p.739] we obtain
hu′ (t) + A0 u(t) + A1 u(t), viE ∗×E + hξ(t), viL2(Γ1 )2
= hDiv K(C(t)) + f (t), viE ∗×E for all v ∈ E, a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).
Moreover, using (53)–(55), we pass to limit in (19) and get
hC ′ (t) + B0 C(t) + B1 (u(t), C(t)), ηiV ∗ ×V = hg C(t), ηiL2 (Ω)
for all η ∈ V, a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).
Since the mapping E ∋ w → w(0) ∈ H is linear and continuous, from (40) and
(45), we have um (0) → u(0) weakly in H, which together with u0m → u0 in H entails
u(0) = u0 . Similarily, since W ∋ ζ → ζ(0) ∈ L2 (Ω) is linear and continuous, we obtain
C(0) = C0 . Finally, taking into account that ξ(t) ∈ ∂j(uτ (t)) for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ), we
conclude that u ∈ E and C ∈ W is a solution to Problem 7. Observe, that by (41),
we have the additional regularity C ∈ L∞ (0, T ; H 1(Ω)). This concludes the existence
proof.
We pass to the proof of uniqueness of solution to Problem 7. To show uniqueness
of solution, we assume additionally the regularity of function j stated in H(j)(e).
Let (u1 , C1 ) and (u2 , C2 ) be two solutions of Problem 7. Set u = u1 − u2 and
C = C1 − C2 . Using property (10), we obtain that (u, C) is a solution to the following
problem.
hu′ (t) + A0 u(t) + A1 u1 (t) − A1 u2 (t), vi + hξ 1(t) − ξ 2 (t), vi
= −kh∆C1 (t)∇C1 (t) − ∆C2 (t)∇C2 (t), vi for all v ∈ E, a.e. t ∈ (0, T ), (56)
hC ′ (t) + B0 C(t) + B1 (u1 (t), C1 (t) − B1 (u2 (t), C2 (t), ηi = hg C(t), ηi
for all η ∈ V, a.e. t ∈ (0, T ),

(57)

u(0) = 0, C(0) = 0.

(58)

Since C ∈ L2 (0, T ; V )) equation (57) is equivalent to the following
hC ′ (t) − d∆C(t) + B1 (u1 (t), C1 (t)) − B1 (u2 (t), C2 (t)), ηiL2 (Ω) = hg C(t), ηiL2 (Ω)
for all η ∈ L2 (Ω), a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(59)

u(0) = 0, C(0) = 0.
First, observe that from Lemma 6 we have for u1 , u2, u = u1 − u2 ∈ E
a1 (u1 , u1 , u1 − u2 ) − a1 (u2 , u2 , u1 − u2 ) = a1 (u1 , u1 , −u2 ) − a1 (u2 , u2 , u1)
14

= a1 (u1, u2 , u1 ) − a1 (u2 , u2 , u1) = a1 (u, u2, u1 ) = a1 (u, u2, u).

(60)

Moreover, from Lemma 2 and H(j)(e) we have
−hξ1 (t) − ξ2 (t), u1(t) − u2 (t)i ≤ m1 ku(t)k2L2 (Γ) ≤ εku(t)k2E + M(ε)ku(t)k2H

(61)

for ε > 0 and a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). Finally, choosing v = u(t) and η = −k∆C(t) in (56) and
(59), respectively and adding resulting equations gives, using g ≥ 0, (12), (60) and
(61) we calculate

From Lemma 6 and the Cauchy inequality with ε > 0, we have

for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). By estimates (30)–(33), it is clear that functions u1 and u2 belong to L2 (0, T ; E) ∩ L∞ (0, T ; H), and C1 belongs to L∞ (0, T ; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2 (0, T ; V ).
Integrating (66) over (0, t) for t ∈ (0, T ) and applying the Gronwall lemma, we obtain
ku(t)k2H + k k∇C(t)k2L2 (Ω) ≤ M (ku(0)k2 + kC(0)k2 )

(67)

for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). Finally, from conditions (58) and (67), we conclude that u ≡ 0 and
C ≡ 0. This proves the uniqueness of solution to Problem 7.
In this paper we have studied a two-dimensional ﬂuid ﬂow and we have left threedimensional problem for a future work since this problem would be more diﬃcult and
the solution would be probably deﬁned only on a smaller time interval. Moreover,
it would be interesting to consider in the future work a problem not with the slip
boundary condition, but with a leak boundary condition, see [13] for Navier-Stokes
problem with the leak condition.
