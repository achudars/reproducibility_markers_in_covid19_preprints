Abstract
We investigated implications of recently released ‘Joint Light-curve Analysis’ (JLA)
supernova Ia (SNe Ia) data for dark energy models with time varying equation of state of
dark energy, usually expressed as w(z) in terms of variation with corresponding redshift z.
From a comprehensive analysis of the JLA data, we obtain the observational constraints
on the different functional forms of w(z), corresponding to different varying dark energy
models often considered in literature, viz. CPL, JBP, BA and Logarithmic models. The
constraints are expressed in terms of parameters (wa , wb ) appearing in the chosen functional form for w(z), corresponding to each of the above mentioned models. Realising
dark energy with varying equation of state in terms of a homogeneous scalar field φ, with
its dynamics driven by a k−essence Lagrangian L = V F (X) with a constant potential
V and a dynamical term F (X) with X = (1/2)∇µ φ∇µ φ we reconstructed form of the
function F (X). This reconstruction has been performed for different varying dark energy
models at best-fit values of parameters (wa , wb ) obtained from analysis of JLA data. In
the context of k−essence model, we also investigate the variation of adiabatic sound speed
squared, c2s (z), and obtained the domains in (wa , wb ) parameter space corresponding to
the physical bound c2s > 0 implying stability of density perturbations.

Introduction

Measurement of redshift and luminosity distances for Type Ia Supernova (SNe Ia) events [1],
[2], are instrumental in establishing the fact that the universe has undergone a transition
from a phase of decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion during its late time phase of
evolution. Other independent evidences in support of this fact come from the observations
of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation ([3],[4],[5],[6],[7]), Cosmic Microwave Background radiations
([8],[9],[10],[11]) measurement of differential ages of the galaxies in GDDS, SPICES and VDSS
surveys [12, 13, 14, 15] and studies of power spectrum of matter distributions of the universe.
A general label attributed to the origin of this late time cosmic acceleration is ‘Dark Energy’
(DE). Besides, study of rotation curves of spiral galaxies [16], Bullet cluster [17], gravitational lensing [18], provide indirect evidence for existence of non-luminous matter in present
universe. Such ‘matter’, labelled as ‘Dark Matter’ (DM) manifest its existence only through
gravitational interactions. Measurements in satellite borne experiments - WMAP [19] and
Planck [20] have established that, at present epoch, dark energy and dark matter comprise

around 96% of total energy density of the universe (∼69% dark energy and ∼27% dark matter). Rest ∼4% is contributed by baryonic matter with negligible contribution from radiations.
There exist diverse theoretical approaches aiming construction of different models for dark
energy to explain the present day cosmic acceleration. These include the Λ−CDM model
[21] which provides excellent agreement with the cosmological data. Here ‘CDM’ refers to
Cold Dark Matter content of the universe and Λ, the cosmological constant, denotes vacuum energy density. Though this model provides a simple phenomenological solution, it is
plagued with the problem of large disagreement between vacuum expectation value of energy momentum tensor and observed value of dark energy density (fine tuning problem).
This motivates investigation of alternative models of dark energy. One of the key features
of a class of such models, called varying dark energy models, is time varying equation of
state w = p/ρ (ρ is the energy density and p the pressure of dark energy) of dark energy
which is usually expressed in terms of variation of w with redshift z (in Λ−CDM model
w = −1, constant). The redshift dependence of the EOS parameter w(z), in the context of
the varying DE models may be constrained from the observational data. The starting point
for dealing with the issue of variations of the EOS parameter w(z) is to consider diverse
functional forms of w(z; wa , wb ) each involving a small number of parameters (denoted in the
text by symbols wa , wb ). The observational constraints on the z−dependence of w may then
be realised in terms of constraints on the parameters (wa , wb ) for each different functional
forms of w(z; wa , wb ) considered. In this work we have performed a comprehensive analysis
of ‘Joint Light-curve Analysis’ (JLA) data ([22],[23],[24]) to obtain constraints on different
functional forms of w(z) often used in literature in the context of varying dark energy models
([25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30],[31],[32],[33],[34],[35],[36] and references there in). As benchmark
we have chosen four such models viz. CPL[25], JBP[29],[30], BA[31],[32] and and Logarithmic
model [33], and for each model we presented the values of the parameters (wa , wb ) those fit
best the observational data from JLA and also shown the regions in this parameter space at
different confidence limits allowed from observational data.
Dark energy with varying equation of state may be realised theoretically in terms of dynamics
of a scalar field (φ). One class of such scalar field models, called ‘Quintessence’, is described
in terms of standard canonical Lagrangian of the form L = X − V (φ) where X = 21 ∇µ φ∇µ φ
is the kinetic term. There also exist alternative class of models involving Lagrangians with
non-canonical kinetic terms as L = V (φ)F (X), where F (X) is a function of X. Such models,
called k−essence models, have interesting phenomenological consequences different from those
of quintessence models. Another motivation for considering k−essence scalar fields is that
they appear naturally in low energy effective string theory. Such theories with non-canonical
kinetic terms was first proposed by Born and Infeld to get rid of the infinite self-energy of the
electrons [37] and were also investigated by Heisenberg in the context of cosmic ray physics
[38] and meson production [39]. In this work, we consider dark energy represented in terms
of a homogeneous scalar field φ ≡ φ(t) whose dynamics is driven by a k−essence Lagrangian
L = V F (X) with a constant potential V . The constancy of the potential ensures existence of
a scaling relation, XFX2 = Ca−6 (C = constant), in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) background space-time with scale factor a. We exploited the scaling relation and
observational constraints on the parameters wa , wb , to reconstruct the forms of the function
F (X) for the different varying dark energy models.

In the context of k−essence model, we also investigate the adiabatic sound speed squared
(c2s ) [40] - the quantity relevant for the growth of small fluctuations in the background energy
density. Imaginary value of the sound speed (c2s < 0) implies instability of density perturbations. Also from causality, it requires the speed of propagation of density perturbations
not to exceed the speed of light (c2s < 1). However, it was pointed out in [41, 42, 43] that
in k−essence theories superluminal propagation of perturbations on classical backgrounds is
admissible and no causal paradoxes arise. This implies the condition c2s > 0 would be enough
to represent the physical bound in the context of k−essence theories. For each of the varying
dark energy models considered here, we find z-dependence of c2s at best-fit values of parameters wa , wb obtained from analysis of JLA data. This has been found over the entire redshift
range 0 < z < 1.3 accessible in SNe Ia observations corresponding to the JLA data. We
note that at the best-fit, c2s is not always within its physical bound (c2s > 0) for all values
of z in the above mentioned range. For each of the varying DE models, we have found the
regions in wa − wb parameter space for which the physical bound c2s > 0 is satisfied for the
entire range of values of z in JLA data. The best-fit values of parameters (wa , wb ) for each
model obtained from analysis of the observational data are found to lie outside this domain
corresponding to the bound c2s > 0 (and also to 0 < c2s < 1 ) implying that observational
data allow values of parameters (wa , wb ), for which the physical bound on c2s is respected,
only at higher confidence limits. For example, for BA and Logarithmic models the values of
parameters (wa , wb ) corresponding to 0 < c2s (z) < 1 for all z is allowed from observational
data only beyond ∼ 2σ confidence limits. It is allowed only at 3σ and beyond for CPL model
and even at larger confidence limits for JBP model. For each of the models we have found the
point in wa − wb parameter space which belongs to the domain for which 0 < c2s < 1 for all z
and is maximally favoured from observational data. The form of the k−essence Lagrangian
density F (X) are also reconstructed at these points.
The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we describe the methodology of analysis of
the observational data and provide a brief description of the different data sets used in our
analysis. In Sec. 3 we discussed different models of dark energy with varying equation of
state and their realisations in terms of kessence scalar field models. In this context we also
discussed relevance of investigating variations of the adiabatic sound speed squared. The
methodology of obtaining form of the Lagrangian density L = V F (X) for k−essence models
are also described. In Sec. 4 we discussed the results on the variation of c2s , form of the
function F (X) obtained from the analysis of the data. The conclusions are presented in Sec.
5.

Methodology of Analysis of Observational Data

Measurement of luminosity distances and redshift of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are instrumental in probing nature of dark energy. There exist several systematic and dedicated
measurements of SNe Ia events. There are different supernova surveys in different domains
of redshift (z). High redshift projects (z ∼ 1) include Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)
([44],[45]), the ESSENCE project [46], the Pan-STARRS survey ([47],[48],[49],[50]). The
SDSS-II supernova surveys ([51],[52],[53], [54],[55]) probe the redshift regime 0.05 < z < 0.4.
The surveys in the small redshift domain (z > 0.1) are the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics survey [56], the Carnegie Supernova Project ([57],[58],[59]) the Lick Observatory

Supernova Search [60] and the Nearby Supernova Factory [61]. Other different compilations
of Sne Ia data may also be found in ([62],[63],[64]) and references in [46]. Nearly one thousand
of SNe Ia events were discovered in all these surveys.
The recently released “Joint Light-curve Analysis” (JLA) data ([22],[23],[24]) is a compilation
of several low, intermediate and high redshift samples including data from the full three years
of the SDSS survey, first three seasons of the five-year SNLS survey and 14 very high redshift
0.7 < z < 1.4 SNe Ia from space-based observations with the HST [12]. This data set contains
740 spectroscopically confirmed SNe IA events with high-quality light curves.
In this section we describe the methodology of analysis of JLA data to obtain bounds on
equation of state parameter w of dark energy. There exist diverse statistical techniques for
analysis of JLA data. Some of these methods are discussed in detail in ([33],[65],[66],[67],[68]).

k−essence and Varying Dark energy

In this work we investigate realisation of dark energy with varying equation of state in terms of
k−essence scalar field models. We assume dark energy represented in terms of a homogeneous
6

scalar field whose dynamics is driven by a k-essence Lagrangian with constant potential. In
this context, we give below a brief outline of basic equations of k−essence model i.e.
L = V (φ)F (X) = p

(11)

ρ = V (φ)(2XFX − F )

(12)

where L is the k-essence Lagrangian, ρ and p respectively represent energy density and pressure of dark energy. F (X) is a function of X, where X = 12 ∇µ φ∇µ φ, FX ≡ dF/dX and V (φ)
represents the potential. In a flat FLRW spacetime background, ρ and p are related by the
continuity equation
ρ̇ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0 ,

(13)

where H = ȧ/a is the Hubble constant and a(t) is the scale factor. For a homogeneous scalar
field φ, in a flat FLRW spacetime background, we have X = 21 φ̇2 . We consider k−essence
models with constant potential V (φ) = V which ensures existence of scaling relation [69, 70]

it has been shown in [75], that for X(= 12 φ̇2 , in our case) > 0, the quantity c2s plays the role
of sound speed squared for propagation of small perturbations. However, in the context of
spatially flat FRW universe, with small perturbations, neglecting vector perturbations which
decay as a−2 , the metric may be written as
ds2 = (1 + 2Φ)dt2 − a2 (t)[(1 − 2Φ)δij + hij ]dxi dxj

(19)

where Φ (the gravitational Newtonian potential) is the scalar perturbation and hij is traceless
transverse perturbations. From the standard results of cosmological perturbation theory
[75, 76, 77], it follows that perturbations in the k-essence field δφ, which are gauge invariant are
connected with the scalar metric perturbations and the dynamics of cosmological perturbation
may described by the action of the form

(21)

A derivation for the above formula from an effective hydrodynamical description of the system
is also obtained in [71].
Therefore, for the classical solutions F (X) of the scaling relation Eq. (14) to be stable against
small perturbations of the background energy density, the square of adiabatic sound speed
should be positive (c2s > 0). On the other hand, causality arguments require that this speed
of propagation small perturbations of the background should not exceed the speed of light,
implying c2s < 1 [78, 79, 80]. In the context of k−essence model, using Eqs. (11) and (12) in
(21) we have
c2s =

FX
2XFXX + FX

(22)

Using 1/a = 1 + z (where z is the redshift and value of scale factor a at present epoch is
normalised to unity) in H = ȧ/a we have dt = −dz/(1 + z)H. Exploiting this result and
transforming time dependences of ρ, p and w to their z−dependences in Eq. (13) we may also
express the sound speed squared as a function of redshift z as
c2s =

3w(1 + w) + (1 + z)dw/dz
3(1 + w)

(23)

We note from Eq. (23) that the bound c2s > 0 corresponds to
either
or

−(1 + z)dw/dz < 3w(1 + w), w > −1

−(1 + z)dw/dz > 3w(1 + w), w < −1

(24)

and the bound c2s < 1 corresponds to
either
or

−(1 + z)dw/dz > 3(w2 − 1), w > −1

−(1 + z)dw/dz < 3(w2 − 1), w < −1

(25)

Whether the physical bound c2s > 0 (or 0 < c2s < 1) is realised for any chosen functional
form of equation of state w(z) may be verified by checking the conditions given in Eq. (24)

Table 1: Functional forms of equation of state w(z) of dark energy as used in different
varying dark energy Models. Expressions for corresponding z-dependences of dark energy
density, expressed through the function Y (z) (Eq. ((26))) are also given.
(or Eqs. (24)and (25)). These conditions are pictorially demonstrated in Fig. 1 (see [78] for
details) where we have studied effect of the conditions on the plane spanned by quantities
w and (−(1 + z)dw/dz). The shaded region marked in the figure is bounded by two curves
(−(1 + z)dw/dz) = 3w(1 + w) (dashed line) and (−(1 + z)dw/dz) = 3(w2 − 1) (solid line).
We have also shown the w = −1 line in the plane. From Eq. (24) and (25) we see that c2s > 0
corresponds to the region in the plane which is below the dashed line for w > −1 and above
the dashed line for w < −1. The condition c2s < 1, on the other hand, corresponds to the
region lying above the solid line for w > −1 and below the solid line for w < −1. The shaded
region, bounded between these two lines in the plane, therefore corresponds 0 < c2s < 1 for
the entire range of values of z accessible in the observations considered here.
Variation in the dark energy density ρ(z) may be expressed in terms of variation of dark
energy equation of state w(z). Expression for a general functional form of w(z), in principle,
involves infinite number of parameters. However, for a practical analysis its effective to express the functional dependence w(z), in terms a small number of parameters and consider
different forms of parametrizations of w(z) . We consider here 4 different models, often used in
literature in the context of varying dark energy, viz. CPL[25] , JBP[29],[30], BA([31],[32]) and
Logarithmic model [33]. Each of the models uses a specific functional form of w(z) expressed
in terms of two parameters (wa and wb ) and

functional form of the quantity Y (z) ≡ exp 3 0 dz 1+z ′ which gives the z−dependence of
the corresponding dark energy density ρ(z) (see Eq. (26)). In the plane of Fig. 1, we have also
shown the curves representing the different parametrisations of w(z) for the best-fit values of

depicting variation of χ2 with one of the parameters at a time, values of the other parameters
are kept fixed at their respective best-fit values as given in Tab. 2 (solid lines for best-fits
of SNe Ia data alone and dotted lines for the best-fits from the combined analysis of SNe

varying dark energy models listed in Table 1. For each of the models we obtain the best-fit
values of the parameters (wa , wb ) along with their allowed domains at different confidence
limits from the analysis. We perform analysis of SNe Ia data alone and also a combined
analysis of data from SNe Ia, BAO and OHD (discussed in Sec. 2) where we freely vary the
parameters wa , wb , Ω0m , α and β to find their best-fit values (corresponding to minimum value
of χ2 in Eq. (10)). The obtained best-fit values of the above parameters for different models
are presented in Table 2.
We also find the ranges of the individual parameters allowed at different confidence levels
from the analysis of the observational data. To obtain this, we find the variation of χ2 with
each of the parameters of the set {wa , wb , Ω0m , α, β} at a time, keeping values of all other

parameter may then be obtained from the distribution of the function ∆χ2 ≡ χ2 − χ2min [81].
The range of values of the parameter for which ∆χ2 6 1, ∆χ2 6 4 and ∆χ2 6 9 respectively
correspond to 1σ (68.3% Confidence Level (C.L)), 2σ (95.4% C.L) and 3σ (99.73% C.L) [81]
allowed intervals of the parameter. We have shown in Fig. 2 the nature of dependence of
∆χ2 ≡ χ2 − χ2min on each of the individual parameters. For demonstrative purpose, we have
shown the plot for CPL model only. However, the obtained 1σ and 3σ ranges of the individual
parameters for different models of parametrisations of w(z), are given in Tab. 3.
For a comparative study of the different parametrisations of w(z), we have also displayed
the joint confidence region in the parameter space of wa and wb . To obtain this we keep
0 , α, β) at their respective best-fit values and obtain domains in
the other parameters (ωm
wa − wb parameter space for which evaluated values of χ2 lie in the domain χ2 = χ2min + ∆χ2 .
The 1σ, 2σ and 3σ joint confidence region of two parameters (wa and wb ) correspond to
∆χ2 < 2.30, ∆χ2 < 6.17 and ∆χ2 < 11.8 respectively [81]. The obtained joint confidence
regions in wa − wb parameter space for the different w(z) parametrisations are shown in Fig.
3. The corresponding best-fit points are also shown in the parameter space.
In the context of k−essence model of dark energy, we investigate, to what extent the condition 0 < c2s < 1 is favoured from observational data for different parametrisations of the
dark energy equation of state w(z). We used the different parametrisations of w(z) in Eqs.
(24) and (25) to find the range of values of the parameters wa and wb for which the condition
0 < c2s < 1 is satisfied for all z within the domain of observations. For each of the parametrisations of w(z) mentioned in Table 1, this range is shown by a shaded region in wa − wb plane
13

in Fig. 3. The regions corresponding to c2s > 0 only are also shown for each model. We then
observe that for all the models, the shaded region corresponding to 0 < c2s < 1 has no overlap
with the region bounded by 1σ contour allowed from analysis of SNe Ia data alone. For BA
and Logarithmic models the overlap is seen when one considers allowed ranges at and beyond
∼ 2σ confidence limits. This implies that the physical bound 0 < c2s < 1 for the entire range of
values of z probed by the observed data considered here, is favoured from observational data
(SNe Ia only) at and above ∼ 2σ confidence level if we consider parametrisations of w(z) as
in BA and Logarithmic models. For CPL parametrisation the physical bound is disfavoured
below ∼ 3σ and with JBP its disfavoured upto even higher confidence limits. For all the
different parametrisations of w(z) the physical bound is disfavoured to a larger extent from
a combined analysis of SNe Ia , BAO and OHD. In the wa − wb parameter space shown in
Fig. 3, we have also marked a point P1 in the shaded region corresponding to 0 < c2s < 1, at
which the value of χ2 is closest to the value of χ2min for the corresponding model. Thus P1
refers to the maximally favoured values of parameters wa and wb from observational data for
which c2s lies between 0 and 1 for all z values. The values of (wa , wb ) corresponding to P1 are
shown in the last column of table 2.
At the best-fit values of parameters wa and wb obtained from the combined analyses of observational data from Sne IA, BAO and OHD for different w(z) parametrisations we have shown
the variation of sound speed squared c2s (z) with redshift z in left panel of Fig. 4. We see
that at the best-fit values of the parameters the calculated value of c2s lies within its physical
bound 0 < c2s < 1 only for a vary narrow range of values of z. These ranges are also shown in
Table 2. The variation of c2s at values of wa , wb corresponding to the point P1 are shown for
different models in the middle panel of Fig. 4. These correspond to a monotonous variation
of c2s with z within its physical bound 0 < c2s < 1 imposed by causality and stability.
In Sec. 3 we discussed the methodology to reconstruct the form of function F (X) for different
form of parametrisations of w(z). We have shown in right panel of Fig. (4) the obtained
dependences of F (X) on X, for each of the models at the corresponding best-fit values of
the parameters (wa , wb ). The Figure shows that for JBP model F (X) has a monotonous
dependence of X whereas for the other models (CPL, BA and Logarithmic) the function is
double valued in a certain domain of X.
As discussed earlier, the cosmological parameters that enter into our analysis are Ω0m and parameters wa and wb which parametrise the equation of state of dark energy. We have obtained
best-fit values of the parameters from analysis of the Sne Ia observational data. However, for
a cosmographic analysis, which is a model independent way of processing cosmological data,
the chosen parameter set is different. Basic aspects of cosmographic methodology and results
of cosmographic analysis of SNe data are discussed in [82, 83, 84]. Here we briefly discuss the
cosmography constructed from DE equation of state. We also qualitatively compare results
of our analysis with the features of results of cosmographic analysis in terms of cosmographic
parameters.
Neglecting the contribution to the present day energy density due to radiation Ω0r in Eq. (4)

where, ′ in above equation denotes derivative with respect to z. We consider two cosmographic
parameters: the deceleration parameter q(z) and the jerk parameters j(z) which are defined
in a model independent way as

These parameters are relevant in describing features of expansion of the universe. q(z) is
positive (negative) for a decelerating (accelerating) universe. Evolution of the jerk parameter
j(z) is relevant in search for for departure from Λ-CDM model [85]. Exploiting the d/dt =
−(1 + z)H(z)d/dz in above equations we in above equations we express q(z) and j(z) as

where ′ in above two equations denote derivative with respect to z. Using Eq. (4) with Ω0r = 0
and Ω0de = 1 − Ω0m in Eqs. (31) and (32) and using expressions for w(z) in terms of parameters
wa and wb for different models considered in this work (as summarised in Tab. 1) we may
express corresponding z−dependences of q(z) and j(z) involving parameters wa , wb and Ω0m .
Putting z = 0, we may then obtain relationships between wa , wb , Ω0m , q0 and j0 , where q0
and j0 corresponds to the values of deceleration parameter and jerk parameter at present
epoch. We may take these two parameters (q0 and j0 ) as cosmographic parameters relevant
in this context. In the methodology of analysis described in Sec. 2, apart from the nuisance
parameters α and β, the set (Ω0m , q0 , j0 ) in stead of the set (Ω0m , wa , wb ) may be chosen for a
cosmographic analysis. A comprehensive statistical analysis of specific DE parametrisations
using SNe Ia data have been performed in [82], which directly gives cosmographic parameters
values. For a qualitative comparison, we have given in Tab. 4, the expressions for q0 and j0
for different DE parametrisations in terms of wa , wb and Ω0m . As discussed in Sec. 4, for each
of the varying dark energy Models, we obtained a point in wa − wb parameter space (marked
by P1 in Fig. 3), corresponding to the parameters satisfying the physical bound 0 < c2s < 1.
Values of these best-fits P1 , are given in the last column of Tab. 2. For a comparison with the
results of comprehensive cosmographic analysis performed in [82], we have also given in Tab.
4, the numerical values of q0 and j0 calculated using the their analytical expressions given in
2nd and 3rd column of the same table, at the point P1 .

Conclusion

In this work we have performed a comprehensive analysis of recently released ‘Joint Lightcurve Analysis’ (JLA) data to investigate its implications for models of dark energy with
varying equation of state parameter w(z). As a benchmark, we considered 4 different varying
dark energy models, viz. CPL[25], JBP[29],[30], BA([31],[32]) and Logarithmic model [33],

each of which involves a specific functional form of z−dependence of the dark energy equation of state w(z). The analytical expression for the function w(z) in each case involves two
parameters, denoted by wa and wb . From the analysis of observational data we have obtained
best-fit values of these parameters and also their ranges allowed at 1σ, 2σ and 3σ confidence
level. Description of the data and methodology of analysis has been discussed in detail in
Sec. 2. The results of the analysis are presented in table 2 and depicted in Fig. 3.
We make an attempt to realise the scenario of varying equation state of dark energy in terms of
dynamics of a scalar field φ. We assume the scalar field to be homogeneous with its dynamics
driven by a k−essence Lagrangian L = V F (X), with a constant potential V and a dynamical
term F (X) with X = (1/2)∇µ φ∇µ φ. Consideration of constant potential ensures a scaling
relation of the form X(dF/dX)2 = Ca−6 (C = constant) in FLRW spacetime background
with scale factor a. We have exploited this to reconstruct functional form of F (X) for the
different varying dark energy models considered here (See Sec. 3 for details). The nature of
F (X) are obtained for each kind of w(z) dependences corresponding to the best-fit parameters
(wa , wb ). In this context, we also obtain the dependences of c2s on z. cs , as mentioned earlier, is
the the speed with which small fluctuation in the background energy density grows. Stability
of the density perturbations and causality requires c2s to lie in the domain 0 < c2s < 1. The
results show that at the best-fits, c2s lies within its physical bound 0 < c2s < 1 only for a
small range of values of z. For each of the varying DE models we have shown the region
of the wa − wb parameter space for which c2s lies with its physical bound for all values of z
accessible in SNe Ia observations. We finally find the point P1 in wa − wb parameter space
for which 0 < c2s < 1 for all z and which is maximally favoured from the observational data.
The z−dependence of c2s and form of F (X) are also obtained for this point (P1 ) for all the
varying DE models. These results are discussed in detail in Sec. 4 and depicted in Fig. 4.
In this section we have also given a comparison of our results with those obtained from a
comprehensive cosmographic analysis performed in [82].
