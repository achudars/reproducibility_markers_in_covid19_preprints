Abstract
A heterodimensional cycle consists of a pair of heteroclinic connections between two saddle periodic orbits with unstable manifolds of different dimensions. Recent theoretical work
on chaotic dynamics beyond the uniformly hyperbolic setting has shown that heterodimensional cycles may occur robustly in diffeomorphisms of dimension at least three. We study
a concrete example of a heterodimensional cycle in the continuous-time setting, specifically
in a four-dimensional vector field model of intracellular calcium dynamics. By employing
advanced numerical techniques, Zhang, Krauskopf and Kirk [Discr. Contin. Dynam. Syst.
A 32(8) 2825–2851 (2012)] found that a heterodimensional cycle exists in this model.
We investigate the geometric structure of the associated stable and unstable manifolds
in the neighbourhood of this heterodimensional cycle, consisting of a single connecting orbit
of codimension one and an entire cylinder of structurally stable connecting orbits between
two saddle periodic orbits. We employ a boundary-value problem set-up to compute their
stable and unstable manifolds, which we visualize in different projections of phase space
and as intersection sets with a suitable three-dimensional Poincaré section. We show that,
locally near the intersection set of the heterodimensional cycle, the manifolds interact as
described by the theory for three-dimensional diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, their
global structure is more intricate, which is due to the fact that it is not possible to find a
Poincaré section that is transverse to the flow everywhere. Our results show that the abstract
concept of a heterodimensional cycle arises and can be studied in continuous-time models
from applications.

Introduction

One of the best-studied forms of chaotic dynamics is uniform hyperbolicity, which arose from
the work of Anosov and Smale in the 1960s [1, 54]. In a uniformly hyperbolic system, every
orbit tends toward one of a finite number of basic sets in phase space. Each point in a basic
set has well-defined directions of expansion and contraction, and tangent to these directions are
stable and unstable manifolds through the point. This form of dynamics is robust, that is, any
small perturbation of a uniformly hyperbolic system is still uniformly hyperbolic. Hence, it is
likely that such chaotic systems may be observed in physical processes, and evidence of such
behaviour has been found in a number of settings; for example, see [13, 28, 53, 56]. Shortly
after its discovery, Smale and others conjectured that uniform hyperbolicity was the “default”
form of chaotic dynamics. That is, they conjectured that any chaotic dynamical system could,
after a small perturbation, be turned into a uniformly hyperbolic system. Consequently, most
chaotic behaviour identified in a mathematical model of a physical process would be uniformly
hyperbolic. Unfortunately, this hypothesis turned out to be false and other forms of robust

Figure 1: Sketch of a heterodimensional cycle in a three-dimensional discrete-time system. Here,
two saddle fixed points γ1 and γ2 have two-dimensional manifolds W s (γ1 ) and W u (γ2 ) that
intersect transversely in a curve B and one-dimensional manifolds W u (γ1 ) and W s (γ2 ) that
intersect in a single orbit (ak )k∈Z . Reproduced from [58].
chaotic dynamics have since been identified; see [11, Chapter 1]. Since these more complicated
forms of non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics also persist under perturbation, they could conceivably
be observed in physical processes as well.
One mechanism that creates non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics is a heterodimensional cycle [10, 11, 15, 39]. Consider a discrete-time dynamical system, a diffeomorphism, with two
hyperbolic fixed (or periodic) points γ1 and γ2 . These points form a cycle if the stable manifold
W s (γ1 ) of γ1 intersects the unstable manifold W u (γ2 ) of γ2 and the stable manifold W s (γ2 ) of
γ2 intersects the unstable manifold W u (γ1 ) of γ1 . The cycle is heterodimensional if γ1 has a
different index from γ2 , that is, their stable manifolds have different dimensions. This requires
a diffeomorphism on a phase space of dimension at least three. Figure 1 shows a sketch of a
heterodimensional cycle for this case of lowest dimension, where W s (γ1 ) and W u (γ2 ) are two
dimensional and W u (γ1 ) and W s (γ2 ) are one dimensional. The intersection B between the surfaces W s (γ1 ) and W u (γ2 ) is transverse and, therefore, persists and is structurally stable under
perturbation of the dynamics. The one-dimensional manifolds W u (γ1 ) and W s (γ2 ), on the other
hand, intersect non-transversely in the heteroclinic orbit (ak )k∈Z . Indeed, this intersection is
of codimension one and can be destroyed by a perturbation of the system. Nevertheless, it
has been proven that, near a given heterodimensional cycle as shown in figure 1, the existence
of a heterodimensional cycle is a C 1 -open property [10, 11, 15]. That is, the existence of any
specific heterodimensional cycle is not itself a C 1 -open property, but for any diffeomorphism
f with a heterodimensional cycle and any sufficiently small ε, there is a C 1 -open set U in the
space of diffeomorphisms ε-close to f where every element of U has a heterodimensional cycle. This phenomenon is closely associated with objects called blenders, which are invariant
sets of diffeomorphisms with the property, in the present context of dimension three, that their
one-dimensional stable or unstable manifold cannot be avoided by one-dimensional curves from
(an open neighbourhood of) a certain direction [8, 9, 16, 34]. Blenders are in some sense a
generalization of Smale’s horseshoe construction to higher dimensions, and their robust defining
property is a form of partially hyperbolic dynamics that has been used to prove the existence of
heterodimensional cycles.
Another mechanism to create non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics is a homoclinic tangency
between a stable and an unstable manifold of a single fixed or periodic point of a diffeomorphism [50]. Such a non-transverse intersection may also be a robust phenomenon when the
2

phase space of the diffeomorphism is at least three [3, 29, 30, 31, 33, 55]. Homoclinic tangencies
and heterodimensional cycles are closely related; see [14, §1.1]. A conjecture of Palis states that
every dynamical system may be perturbed (in the C r -topology of diffeomorphisms) to produce
a system that is either uniformly hyperbolic or has a homoclinic tangency or a heterodimensional cycle [48, 50]. Limited versions of this conjecture have been verified in a number of
settings [7, 14].
The progress made in the abstract study of possible forms of chaotic dynamics has primarily
focussed on diffeomorphisms, that is, on discrete-time dynamical systems. One major reason is
that the phase-space dimension needed for discrete-time systems to create a particular type of
chaos is always smaller than that needed for continuous-time systems. In many applications,
on the other hand, mathematical models have continuous time and are given in the form of a
system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), that is, their dynamics is determined by a
flow; see, for example, [24, 25, 32, 37] as entry points to the extensive literature on models from
applications. Hence, it is an important question how different types of dynamics that have been
found in diffeomorphisms manifest themselves in flows.
Of course, there is a well-known connection between continuous-time and discrete-time systems. Given a diffeomorphism one can construct its suspension, which is an abstract flow with
an additional direction that represents the continuous time and whose time-one map is the diffeomorphism. Clearly, periodic points of the diffeomorphism correspond to periodic orbits of
the flow. On the other hand, a periodic orbit of a vector field corresponds to fixed points of
the associated Poincaré return map, which is obtained by introducing a (local) cross section
transverse to the periodic orbit and, hence, the flow nearby. Indeed, the stability and bifurcation analysis of periodic orbits of vector fields is derived from the corresponding stability and
bifurcations of the associated fixed points [44]. More precisely, the dynamics of a vector field
locally in the neighbourhood of a periodic orbit can be described exactly in terms of the dynamics of a diffeomorphism locally in the neighbourhood of the corresponding fixed point of the
associated Poincaré return map, and vice versa. However, when the dynamics is more complicated, and certainly in parameter regions where chaotic behaviour occurs, it may be necessary
to consider a rather larger domain of definition of the Poincaré return map. Unless the vector
field is periodically forced, that is, the flow is a suspension, it is not possible to find a section
(codimension-one submanifold) to which the flow is transverse at any point. Hence, the Poincaré
return map can only be defined locally in regions where the flow is transverse to the section and,
moreover, the flow returns back to the section [6, 23, 45, 38]. Especially when one is interested in
chaotic dynamics associated with homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of closed periodic orbits [36, 51, 52], the overall picture of how their invariant manifolds intersect a codimension-one
section of interest cannot be determined from the information of an equivalent diffeomorphism
alone. Indeed, advanced numerical methods have an important role to play in determining the
global organization of phase space, how it changes with parameters and connects with known
theory [27, 40].
In this paper, we investigate a heterodimensional cycle in a four-dimensional vector field
that represents a simple model of intracellular calcium oscillations. The model is based on the
so-called Atri model [2] and, in the form studied in [57], it is given by the four differential

for the concentration of calcium c inside the cell, its voltage v, the total calcium level ct (including
that stored in the so-called endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is a safe internal storage of
this toxic substance) and the gating variable n that describes transport of calcium through
the membrane. The Atri model takes spatial variation into account, system (1) is written in
moving-frame coordinates and differentiation is with respect to the travelling-wave coordinate.
Hence, periodic and solitary calcium waves are represented by periodic and homoclinic orbits
of (1), respectively. We consider how the possible dynamics depends on the wave speed s and
the parameter J, which represents a given flux of calcium entering the cell from the outside in.
All other parameters are constant and their values are given in Table 1.
The Atri model (1) exhibits very complicated dynamics [57] and, in particular, Zhang,
Krauskopf, and Kirk [58] realized that this system has a heterodimensional cycle between two
periodic orbits with different indices. This global object was found numerically by careful computations with a new numerical method (an implementation of Lin’s method) developed and
presented in [58]. To our knowledge, system (1) is still the only known explicit vector field
arising from an application that exhibits a heterodimensional cycle between two periodic orbits,
and it has the lowest required dimension. We will refer to this heterodimensional cycle also as a
PtoP cycle (for Periodic orbit to Periodic orbit); note that this short-hand notation comes from
the literature on computing connecting orbits of vector fields, where heteroclinic cycles between
an equilibrium and a periodic orbit (such as the one that gives rise to the chaotic attractor in
the Lorenz system) are also referred to as EtoP cycles [22, 43, 58].
We present a case study of how the abstract theory of heterodimensional cycles manifests
itself in a concrete vector field such as system (1). More specifically, we show how the respective global stable and unstable manifolds of the two periodic orbits intersect and give rise to
the transverse and non-transverse parts of the heterodimensional cycle. We employ a state-ofthe-art numerical approach based on boundary-value problem formulations [27, 40] to compute
and visualize selected families of orbit segments; these computations are conducted with the
pseudo-arclength continuation package Auto [18, 19]. We show three-dimensional projections
of the four-dimensional phase space to illustrate one by one how the intersection sets of the
different global manifolds with a suitable codimension-one section Σ arise. Taken together, this
information makes clear how (the intersection set of) the heterodimensional cycle is generated,
to what extent it represents the theory for diffeomorphisms, and what the differences are. More
generally, the results presented here show that it is entirely feasible with state-of-the-art numerical methods to find and investigate objects as complex as a heterodimensional PtoP cycle in
continuous-time models from applications. Hence, theoretical insights on new types of robust

4

dynamics can now be investigated in terms of their relevance in specific contexts.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the heterodimensional cycle in
the four-dimensional phase space of system (1). Section 3 is devoted to the manifold structure
that gives rise to the PtoP cycle. The codimension-one section Σ is introduced in section 3.1,
and section 3.2 shows the intersection sets of the PtoP cycle with Σ. Section 3.3 then introduces
the intersection set of the two-dimensional stable manifold and section 3.4 that of the twodimensional unstable manifold. How the two intersection sets interact in the three-dimensional
section Σ is explained in section 3.5, which also contains a comparison with the case of a
diffeomorphism. We end in section 4 with some conclusions and suggestions for future research.

The heterodimensional PtoP cycle

In this paper, we explore the global manifold structure giving rise to a codimension-one heterodimensional PtoP cycle in system (1). The PtoP cycle was found in [58] for fixed s = s∗ = 9.0
at J = J ∗ ≈ 3.02661 with an implementation of Lin’s method, and its locus was then found as a
curve in the (J, s)-plane. We start our investigation in the same way, where, as in [58], all other
parameters are as given in Table 1.
Figure 2 shows the respective part of the (J, s)-plane in panel (a) and two three-dimensional
projections of the PtoP cycle at (J ∗ , s∗ ) in panels (b) and (c). In figure 2(a), two periodic orbits
Γ1 and Γ2 bifurcate from the curve SL of saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits. These two
periodic orbits are both hyperbolic, of saddle type and of different index in the region that is
bounded by SL and the curves H of Hopf bifurcation, where Γ2 bifurcates, and PD of perioddoubling bifurcation, where Γ1 bifurcates. Notice that the curve SL ends on H at a degenerate
Hopf point DH of codimension two, while the curve PD is tangent to SL at a codimension-two
saddle-node-period-doubling point PS. The heterodimensional cycle exists along the curve PtoP,
which ends at a point (not labelled) on the curve PD.
The point (J ∗ , s∗ ) is marked, and the corresponding heterodimensional PtoP cycle is shown
in panels (b) and (c) of figure 2. More specifically, these images show the PtoP cycle between
the two periodic orbits Γ1 and Γ2 , which have Floquet multipliers

λs1 ≈ 2.8 × 10−1 ,

and

λuu

λu2 ≈ 1.3,

and λs2 ≈ 3.4 × 10−1 ,

respectively. Hence, Γ1 has a two-dimensional unstable manifold W u (Γ1 ) and a three-dimensional
stable manifold W s (Γ1 ), while Γ2 has a three-dimensional unstable manifold W u (Γ2 ) and a twodimensional stable manifold W s (Γ2 ). The three-dimensional manifolds W s (Γ1 ) and W u (Γ2 )
intersect transversely, as expected. The two-dimensional manifolds W s (Γ2 ) and W u (Γ2 ), on the
other hand, have a non-transverse intersection at the special parameter pair (J ∗ , s∗ ). We denote
these non-empty intersections by
A := W s (Γ2 ) ∩ W u (Γ1 ),

and B := W s (Γ1 ) ∩ W u (Γ2 ).

The intersection set A is one dimensional and consists of a single trajectory from Γ1 to Γ2 .
The intersection set B is two dimensional and forms a topological cylinder consisting of a oneparameter family of trajectories from Γ2 to Γ1 . Note the strong contraction toward Γ1 in
backward time and the much slower approach toward Γ2 in forward time, which is particularly
visible in panel (c); this difference in speed is due to the fact that the ratio λs2 /λss
1 is of the order
102 . The curve PtoP in the (J, s)-plane in panel (a) was computed by parameter continuation
of the non-transverse, codimension-one connecting orbit A, while checking that the cylinder B,
that is, the entire heterodimensional cycle, also exists along PtoP.

2.1

Numerical approach to finding the PtoP cycle

As mentioned in the introduction, the computation of the heterodimensional cycle for system (1)
requires the advanced numerical approach from [58]. Its major element is that it is based on Lin’s
method [46], which has the important property that it defines a smooth test function — thereby

6

guaranteeing (under very mild starting conditions) that a particular homoclinic or heteroclinic
orbit is found if it exists. We refer to [58] for the full details, but give a brief overview here of
the steps involved.
Numerical methods for approximating connecting orbits are not new; see [4] and references
therein. Initially, the interest was in computing connections between equilibria. Depending on
the dimensions of the respective eigenspaces, such connections may exist only for specific parameter values, which gives an added computational challenge. The connecting orbit is represented
by an orbit segment truncated at both ends; it is assumed to start close to an equilibrium in
its unstable eigenspace and end close to the same or other equilibrium in its stable eigenspace.
The same approach can also be used for connections involving periodic orbits, where the begin
or end point of the orbit segment is required to lie in the linear eigenbundle associated with the
stable or unstable Floquet multipliers. The connecting orbit is then found as the orbit segment
that solves a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) [4, 5]; this is typically done in a
continuation setting, where the specific connecting orbit is detected as a special solution from a
family with a known solution.
To achieve a well-posed and numerically robust set-up, Beyn [5] popularized the use of projection boundary conditions for the begin and end points of the orbit segment, which provides
full error control. Various implementations exist, involving the continuation of invariant subspaces [17] or the (adjoint) variational equation [20, 21]. The examples in these papers include
computation of so-called EtoP and PtoP connections, that is, heteroclinic orbits between an
equilibrium (E) and a periodic orbit (P), and homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits between one or
two periodic orbits (PtoP), respectively; note that the example of a PtoP connection from [17]
is between two periodic orbits with the same number of stable Floquet multipliers, so they are
not part of a heterodimensional cycle. The continuation of the 2PBVP is started from a solution
found by shooting [17] or via a homotopy step [20, 21]; the latter is also the standard approach
for the software package HomCont [12] that computes homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of
equilibria.
The set-up based on Lin’s method provides a natural way to find a first connecting orbit
segment. The implementation for connections between equilibria was presented in [47] and the
approach was extended to connections involving periodic orbits in [43, 58]. The idea is to split
the connecting orbit into two halves and require that both halves have an end point in a suitably
chosen codimension-one section Π that is (locally) transverse to the flow. At the same time,
it is required that the two orbit segments satisfy suitable projection boundary conditions at
their other end points. Typically, the two end points in Π will not be the same, but if they
are then a connecting orbit has been found. The key insight of Lin’s method is that the gap
between the two end points in Π, the so-called Lin gap, can be restricted to lie in a particular
subspace Z ⊂ Π of a dimension related to the codimension of the connecting orbit. In other
words, the Lin gap can be closed in a component-wise manner with respect to a chosen basis for
Z while adjusting the start or end point of one of the orbit segments within the required linear
eigenspace. The computational set-up requires continuation of two orbit segments (double the
system dimension), but this is outweighed by the major advantage that the two-segment 2PBVP
is well posed even when the parameters are such that the particular connecting orbit does not
exist; as long as Π is transverse to the flow for the family of orbit segments under consideration,
a first solution to the 2PBVP can be found relatively easily and a possible special orbit segment
with closed Lin gap can be searched for in the family.
The codimension-one connecting PtoP orbit A = W u (Γ1 ) ∩ W s (Γ2 ) from Γ1 to Γ2 in panels (b) and (c) of figure 2 has been found in this way; here the Lin gap is of dimension one and
closing it requires changing a system parameter, which was J in this case. The corresponding
pair of connecting orbit segments can then be continued in system parameters with the Lin gap
remaining closed, or as a single orbit segment after concatenation of the pair into a single orbit
7

segment. The curve PtoP in figure 2(a) was computed in this way.
The cylinder B = W u (Γ2 ) ∩ W s (Γ1 ) from Γ2 to Γ1 in panels (b) and (c) of figure 2 can be
computed with effectively the same approach. One first finds a pair of orbits with projection
boundary conditions in W s (Γ1 ) and W u (Γ2 ), respectively, with their other end points in Π.
Again, a one-dimensional Lin gap can then be defined in Π, but to close it one does not need to
change system parameters in this case. Rather, varying the distance from one of the periodic
orbits closes the gap. Once a first connecting orbit has been found, the cyclinder can be swept
out as a one-parameter familly while varying the distance from one of the periodic orbits (over
one fundamental domain of the local return); see [58] for the more details.

Global manifold structure of the PtoP cycle

Our goal is to investigate how the heterodimensional PtoP cycle Γ1 ∪ A ∪ Γ2 ∪ B in the fourdimensional system (1) arises from the intersections of the two-dimensional manifolds W u (Γ1 )
and W s (Γ2 ) and the three-dimensional manifolds of W u (Γ2 ) and W s (Γ1 ), respectively. Moreover, we wish to make the connection between this heterodimensional PtoP cycle in a flow and
the abstract theory for diffeomorphisms. The challenge is to compute and visualize parts of
interest of invariant manilofds that provide the insights that we seek. To this end, we again find
and continue orbit segments that are defined by suitable 2PBVPs. Indeed, this approach is very
versatile and accurate when it comes to computing two-dimensional (sub)manifolds. As before,
the key idea is to impose a projection boundary condition near one of the periodic orbits, while
there are several choices for the boundary condition at the other end point; we refer to [40] for
more details and examples, and to [41] for an overview of different methods. In the present
context, such computations can be started from connecting orbits, for example, by relaxing the
requirement of a connection and sweeping out a relevant part of the respective invariant manifold
up to a chosen section.

3.1

The three-dimensional Poincaré section

We now consider the intersection sets of relevant invariant objects with a suitably chosen section.
Recall that, in general, it is not possible to find a so-called global Poincaré section — to which the
flow is transverse everywhere and to which all points return under the flow. Unless the system is
periodically forced, any three-dimensional section Σ will have a codimension-one tangency locus
C ⊂ Σ along which the flow, which we refer to as ϕt , is tangent to Σ. As a result, a return map
f : Σ → Σ can only be defined locally on a subset of Σ \ C with the additional condition that
the images under ϕt also exist [23, 45, 38]. The maximal domain U of definition of a return map
given by ϕt is then
U := {x ∈ Σ \ C | ∃ t > 0 such that ϕt (x) ∈ Σ \ C}.
Note that both U and f (U ) are open subsets of Σ. Any point on the boundary of U either lies
on the tangency locus C or, as it is approached from within U , the return time to Σ tends to
infinity. Note that the flow direction on either side of C typically changes sign with respect to
the normal to Σ; hence, one can split U into two disjoint subsets of Σ, denoted U + and U − ,
which are separated by C. It is natural to define the return maps f + and f − on these subsets
U + and U − , respectively; note that they are generically given by the second return to Σ, that
is, by the second iterate f 2 of f . In particular, the intersection points of a periodic orbit with
Σ will then be fixed points of f + and f − , which both are then the usual local Poincaré maps
near the periodic orbit.
Indeed, the Atri system (1) is not periodically forced, and so any three-dimensional section
will have a tangency locus. However, the system has the nice property that we can choose a
8

hyperplane that is transverse to the heterodimensional cycle, that is, it is transverse to Γ1 and
Γ2 as well as to A and B. The geometric idea is to choose a section that contains a joint curve
of rotation of both Γ1 and Γ2 and, throughout, we consider here the three-dimensional section
Σ := {(c, v, ct , n) ∈ R4 | c = 0.15}.
(Note that this is not the section Π used for finding A and B, which was chosen such that it
intersects neither Γ1 nor Γ2 and separates these two periodic orbits.) Moreover, equation ċ = v
of (1) implies that the tangency locus of Σ is the two-dimensional plane
C := {(c, v, ct , n) ∈ R4 | c = 0.15, v = 0},
which divides Σ into two open sets, Σ+ where v > 0 and Σ− where v < 0.

3.2

The PtoP orbit in the section Σ

Figure 3(a) shows the heterodimensional PtoP cycle with the section Σ and the corresponding
intersection sets in projection onto (c, ct , n)-space; note that Σ appears two dimensional in this
projection and compare with figure 2(c). The intersection sets of the PtoP cycle are shown in
figure 3(b) in the three-dimensional section Σ, that is, in (v, ct , n)-space with c = 0.15. The
periodic orbits Γ1 and Γ2 intersect Σ+ and Σ− in the points γ1± and γ2± , respectively. The

with the property that f ± (a±

±
in backward time, all ak for k < 0 are extremely close to γ1± , respectively.
Figure 3 shows that Σ is indeed transverse to the entire heterodimensional cycle. However,
this does not imply that all trajectories that make up the manifolds W u (Γ1 ), W s (Γ1 ) W u (Γ2 )
and W s (Γ2 ) are transverse to Σ. As a consequence, and as we will show, the intersection sets
of these manifolds with Σ can cross the tangency locus C and may consist of infinitely many
disjoint branches. More specifically, since Γ1 and Γ2 are transverse to Σ, the local return maps
f ± are diffeomorphisms near γ1± and γ2± and the points are hyperbolic fixed points under f ± ,
respectively. Hence, the Stable Manifold Theorem [49] guarantees the existence and smoothness
of unique stable and unstable manifolds for these fixed points. However, their existence as
unique smooth manifolds is guaranteed only locally. If we consider them globally, the stable and
unstable manifolds of γ1± and γ2± — that is, the intersection sets of the respective manifolds of
Γ1 and Γ2 with Σ — may cross the tangency locus C and/or consist of disjoint branches, much
as invariant manifolds of endomorphisms [27, 26, 35, 42].
In spite of this fundamental
difficulty, we now proceed with computing and visualising how

±
b ± of B arise from the interactions between the respective
the intersection sets ak k∈Z of A and B
stable and unstable manifolds of the periodic orbits Γ1 and Γ2 . To this end, we compute and
discuss one by one (relevant parts of) two-dimensional manifolds in the four-dimensional phase

to the part of the orbit segment representing A that starts at a0 and ends very close to Γ2 in
the linear approximation of W s (Γ2 ). This part of the orbit segment can be selected and then
continued by considering it as a solution of the 2PBVP with one end point in Σ+ and the other
still satisfying the projection boundary condition near Γ2 .
Figure 4 shows that the continuation of this orbit segment starting from a+

figure 4 shows, both primary curves arise from the fact that the surface W0s,− (Γ2 ) is a cylinder
transverse to Σ. Both curves are entirely contained in their respective half-spaces Σ± ⊂ Σ and
appear to extend to infinity after passing through a±

The difference is in the global nature of the interacting manifolds: although it is not shown in
figure 1, this sketch suggests that W s (γ2 ) and W u (γ1 ) are single curves that form a heteroclinic
tangle by intersecting in the points ak , where W s (γ2 ) accumulates on W ss (γ1 ) and W u (γ1 )
accumulates on W uu (γ2 ). This is the logical way of completing the picture for a diffeomorphism
in R3 . The diffeomorphism f + on Σ+ , on the other hand is not defined along the discontinuity
locus C and, moreover, certain parts of W s (Γ2 ) and W u (Γ1 ) do not intersect Σ+ ; the latter

many curves. This reflects the fact that there exists no global section for system (1). Figures 11
shows that both W s (Γ2 ) and W u (Γ1 ) accumulate on W ss (Γ1 ) and W uu (Γ2 ), respectively, which
are locally cylinders. In the section Σ, this manifests itself differently near γ2+ and γ1+ because
these local cylinders are intersected by Σ differently: as two arcs in the case of W ss (Γ1 ) and as a
closed curve crossing C in the case of W uu (Γ2 ). Nevertheless, locally
near the heterodimensional

cycle of f + in Σ+ , formed by the point γ1+ , the sequence a+
,
the
point γ2+ , and the curve
k k∈Z
b + , the manifold structure shown in figures 11 and 12 is, indeed, as sketched in figure 1.

Finally, figures 11 and 12 nicely illustrate why further heterodimensional PtoP cycles between Γ1 and Γ2 must exist for nearby parameter values. Namely, because of its accumulation
c u,± (Γ1 ), the curve of W
c u,± (Γ1 ) comes arbitrarily close to W
c s,±(Γ2 ). Hence, in any neighonto W

c (Γ1 ). Since the cylinder B is structurally stable near (J , s ), these will actually form
and W
further heterodimensional cycles, which involve more complicated excursions between Γ1 and
Γ2 . Moreover, the existence of homoclinic orbits to both Γ1 and Γ2 (see also [58]) implies the existence of many other periodic orbits and, hence, suggesting the existence of heterodimensional
cycles involving different pairs of periodic orbits nearby in parameter space.

Conclusions

We showed how stable and unstable manifolds of two saddle periodic orbits with different indices
intersect to form a heterodimensional PtoP cycle of a four-dimensional vector field. The PtoP
cycle of the vector field intersects the transverse three-dimensional section Σ twice on either side
of a two-dimensional subspace C along which the flow is tangent, which represents the typical
situation for flows that are not periodically forced. Namely, the Poincaré map can be defined
only locally (as a second return to Σ) near the respective intersection sets of the PtoP cycle
on either side of C. We found that the structure of the manifolds agrees locally with that of
two saddle fixed points in a three-dimensional diffeomorphism as considered in the literature
on heterodimensional cycles. The global nature of the intersection set, on the other hand, is
more complicated and involves intersection sets crossing the tangency locus C. Geometrically,
the codimension-one part of the PtoP cycle in the four-dimensional phase space arises from the
fact that: (i) the two-dimensional unstable manifold of the first periodic orbit accumulates on
the two-dimensional strong unstable manifold of the second periodic orbit; and (ii) the twodimensional stable manifold of the second periodic orbit accumulates on the two-dimensional
strong stable manifold of the first periodic orbit. How these manifolds intersect the section Σ
near either of the two periodic orbits differs, and this explains the differences between the gobal
properties of the respective intersection sets.
For these results we made extensive use of advanced numerical methods based on a twopoint boundary value problem set-up to define and compute global (sub)manifolds of interest.
This approach is versatile, efficient and, in particular, well suited to deal with large differences
between expansion/contraction rates of the periodic orbits. It allowed us to compute and present
the intersection sets of the respective manifolds in a three-dimensional section transverse to the
two periodic orbits and to both heteroclinic connections that comprise the PtoP cycle. We also
showed with three-dimensional projections how these intersection sets arise from the respective
manifolds in the four-dimensional phase space.
Ongoing work concerns the structure of parameter space near the heterodimensional PtoP
cycle. The codimension-one PtoP connection itself occurs along a curve in the bifurcation diagram in the (J, s)-plane, while the connecting cylinder is structurally stable. Our computations
suggest that there should be further curves of PtoP cycles of the same two periodic orbits nearby,
which correspond to different non-transverse intersections of their two-dimensional global manifolds. Finding and continuing these and other secondary hererodimensional PtoP connections
and cycles is a considerable task. After all, theory predicts that the existence of heterodimensional PtoP can occur robustly, and the question is how this manifests itself in a concrete
system. In particular, robustness of heterodimensional cycles requires that there are infinitely
many periodic orbits of increasingly higher periods nearby. Hence, presenting an overall consistent picture in the parameter plane also requires the computation of other bifurcation curves,

22

especially those of saddle-node bifurcations of periodic orbits and of their period-doubling bifurcations. Indeed, each of these curves may be an end point of a curve of PtoP connections.
For example, we showed that the curve of the primary codimension-one PtoP connection ends
on a curve of period-doubling bifurcation. While the primary codimension-one PtoP connection is then lost, the bifurcating period-doubled periodic orbit has the correct index to form a
new heterodimensional cycle with the periodic orbit that does not bifurcate. Hence, this new
PtoP connection could be seen as the continuation of the primary one. Moreover, we have evidence of the existence of a period-doubling cascade, suggesting that there may be an associated
cascade of heterodimensional PtoP cycles to the successive period-doubled periodic orbits. A
detailed investigation of the respective bifurcation sets in the (J, s)-plane near the primary PtoP
connection will be presented elsewhere.
From a more general perspective, our study shows that abstract concepts, introduced to
advance the theory of dynamical systems, can be detected and investigated in concrete models,
including in ODEs (generally the models of choice) rather than in diffeomorphisms; specifically,
we considered the Atri model, which is from neuroscience and describes intracellular calcium
dynamics. It is an interesting direction for future research to investigate how the complicated
dynamics associated with a heterodimensional PtoP cycle manifests itself in experimental measurements. In case that there is evidence of a heterodimensional PtoP cycle playing an important
role in organizing the system behaviour, the conclusion must be that the ODE model for the
phenomenon studied requires a dimension of at least four.
