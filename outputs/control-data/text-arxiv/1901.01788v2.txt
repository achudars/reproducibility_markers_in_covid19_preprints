Studies of the copper-based superconductors demonstrate how their phase
diagram becomes more complex as experimental probes improve, able to distinguish
among subtly different electronic phases. One of those phases, nematicity, has become the
matter of great interest also in the iron-based superconductors, where it is detected deep
in the tetragonal state. Here we present the evolution of the in-plane Nernst effect
anisotropy in the strain detwinned Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystals. We interpret the
observed behaviour using an approach developed to describe the nematic order
parameter in liquid crystals. We also apply the same model to data from other
superconductors: Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 and YBa2Cu3Oy. We conclude the observed broken
rotational symmetry of the electronic system is a consequence of the emerging
thermodynamic electronic nematic order at a temperature much higher than onset of the
magnetic and structural transitions.

Introduction
The phase diagram of the copper-based superconductors, which initially consisted of
the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases [1] was subsequently supplemented with
regions of occurrence of other electronic orders. These include the pseudo-gap [2], spin density
wave (SDW) [3 as well as three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) charge density
wave (CDW) [4,5]. It appears the presence of some kind of electronic nematic order is a
pervasive characteristic of unconventional superconductors [6,7], which applies also to ironbased superconductors, where the electronic nematic phase is a distinguished feature of their
phase diagram [8]. While there is no agreement yet about a mechanism that leads to breaking
of rotational symmetry in these electron systems, the phenomenon itself has gathered wide
experimental support. It was extensively investigated by spectroscopic [9,10] and
macroscopic [11,12]

probes

including

studies

of

the

response

anisotropy [13,14]. The latter has turned out to be an invaluable source of information about the
nematic phase in cuprates [15,16]. Furthermore, it was argued that this method could detect a
type of nematicity that was unreachable by electrical resistivity studies [15].
In this work we report measurements of the Nernst effect anisotropy, which indicate
emergence of the nematic phase in the electron doped 122 iron-based superconductors. Notably,
the data suggest that at high temperatures we do not observe fluctuations of the low-temperature
nematic order, but rather a development of a fully set nematicity. Such a possibility was early
discussed by M.A. Tanatar et al. [17], and similar conclusions were drawn on the basis of the
magnetic torque [9] and point contact spectroscopy studies [18]. Very recently, the optical
measurements indicated that in Ba(Fe1-xPx)2As2 the electronic-nematic order emerges in a
genuine phase transition [19].
A plausibility of such a scenario was also suggested by another recent studies of the inplane thermoelectric anisotropy in the strain-detwinned Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 iron-based

2

superconductor [13]. Those results include data on the anisotropy of the Nernst effect (ŒîŒΩ)
defined as a difference between the Nernst coefficient determined in the magnetic field parallel
to the crystallographic c axis with the thermal gradient imposed either along the b axis (ŒΩb) or
the a axis (ŒΩa). The striking feature is that ŒîŒΩ in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 is not affected by the
magnetic/structural transition at Ttr and ŒîŒΩ(T) develops smoothly down to the lowest
temperatures changing almost linearly in the semi-logarithmic scale. The onset of the Nernst
anisotropy occurs at a temperature significantly higher than Ttr, although the fact that the
magnetic/structural transition in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 is identified as being second order [20] does
not allow one to exclude that non-zero ŒîŒΩ comes as a result of the critical nematic or magnetic
fluctuations. The case of Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 discussed here is different because the transition in
this compound has been classified as being first-order (discontinuous) [21,22], thus no
substantial contribution from fluctuations is expected.

Experiment
Single crystals of Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 were grown using the Sn-flux method. The Ca, Fe,
As, Co, and Sn elements in molar ratios of 1 : (2-x) : 2 : x : 30 (x = 0, 0.06 and 0.2 respectively
for CaCo0 CaCo3 and CaCo7) were loaded into alumina crucibles and sealed in quartz ampules
under vacuum. The ampules were heated slowly to 1050 C, kept at this temperature for several
hours, and then cooled down slowly to 650 C at a rate of 2 C/h. Next, the liquid tin was decanted
from the crucibles. The Sn residues on the crystals were removed via etching in diluted
hydrochloric acid. The chemical composition of a Co-doped single crystal was determined by
the energy dispersive x-ray analysis.
The Hall coefficient was measured in unstrained crystals in a magnetic field of
B = 12.5 T. Then a sample was mounted between two clamps made of phosphor bronze and
subjected to a uniaxial pressure applied along its sides by a beryllium copper spring controlled

3

with a stepper motor. For the resistivity measurements, the electrical contacts were placed at
the corners of a sample and the orientations of the voltage and current leads were switched
repetitively during the experiment. This allowed the electrical resistivities œÅa and œÅb to be
determined using the Montgomery method [23]. The uniaxial pressure was increased step-bystep and measurements of the resistivity were repeated until a saturation of the anisotropy,
indicating maximal detwinning, was achieved. The maximal pressure determined in this way
was used during subsequent thermoelectric experiments.
The Nernst coefficient was measured along and across the strain direction in two
separate runs with the magnetic field (parallel to c-axis) varied from -12.5 T to +12.5 T. The
temperature difference along a sample was determined using two Cernox thermometers as well
as a calibrated in magnetic field constantan ‚Äì chromel thermocouple attached to the sample
through a few millimetres long and 100 ¬µm thick silver wires. Signal leads were made up of
long pairs of 25 ¬µm phosphor bronze wires. ŒΩa and ŒΩb, which differ within several percent due
to slightly different geometrical factors in two experimental configurations are matched by
applying a multiplicative correction factor close to 1. More details about the experimental setup
are given in Ref. 3.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a presents electrical resistivity measurements performed along the long (a) and
short (b) crystallographic axes in a series of the strain-detwinned Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single
crystals with x = 0 (CaCo0), 0.03 (CaCo3), and 0.07 (CaCo7). In all samples the transition to
the orthorhombic SDW state affect mostly the electrical transport along the b axis. The
anisotropy of the resistivity disappears rather quickly in the tetragonal state as shown in Fig. 1b,
where

(ŒîœÅ = (œÅb - œÅa)/(œÅb + œÅa)) form a sharp step in CaCo0 at 167 K, a two steps transition in CaCo3

4

at 148 K (where the structural and magnetic transitions are separated by about 10 K) and a
rather smooth development of ŒîœÅ below 100 K in CaCo7. The Hall coefficient, which
temperature dependences in the vicinity of the transitions are presented in Fig. 1c, exhibits an
anomaly at the respective temperatures in all three samples, which is not exactly the case for
the Nernst coefficient presented in Fig. 2a. While ŒΩ(T) in CaCo0 and CaCo3 exhibit a clear
step-like change at the structural/magnetic transition (which might be related to the presence of
the Dirac fermions in the SDW phase of the 122 iron based superconductors [24,25]) such an
anomaly is absent in CaCo7. Figure 2b, presenting the temperature and doping evolution of the
Nernst anisotropy calculated as ŒîŒΩ = ŒΩa - ŒΩb, indicates that ŒîŒΩ in CaCo0 and CaCo3 changes
sign below Ttr, whereas for all three samples ŒîŒΩ is positive in the tetragonal state. This is
different from Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2, where (ŒΩa - ŒΩb) is negative for all samples being studied except
of the most doped Ba(Fe0.94Co0.06)2As2, where ŒîŒΩ is small but positive. Interestingly the onset
of ŒîŒΩ shown in Fig. 2c occurs at the temperatures significantly higher than each respective Ttr.
Namely, they are: T* ‚âà 275, 280 and 250 K for CaCo0, CaCo3, and CaCo7, respectively.
Remarkably, these values placed on the x-T phase diagram shown in Fig. 3 closely correspond
to the analogous temperatures determined for the Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 series [13]. The phase
diagrams for both compounds are normalised to match the range of existence of the SDW phase,
ie. T values are divided by the TSDW for respective parent compounds (BaFe2As2 or CaFe2As2),
whereas x values are divided by the respective xSDW that is the cobalt content at which SDW
disappears in T = 0 K limit.
Perhaps the most important outcome of this work is the set of temperature dependences
of the Nernst anisotropy shown in Fig. 4a. We notice that ŒîŒΩ for Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 has opposite
sign to ŒîŒΩ for Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (except for BaCo6) but it is not trivial to explain. The normal
ùõºxy

state Nernst coefficient is composed of two terms: ùúà = (

ùúé

1

‚àí ùëÜtanùúÉ) ùêµ (where Œ±xy is the off-

diagonal element of the Peltier tensor, and ÔÅ± is the Hall angle) and its sign depends on details

5

of the electronic structure and scattering processes. The explanation of the sign change of the
(ŒΩa - ŒΩb) difference between Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 and Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2, which is unlikely
incidental, would require much more elaborated approach than one offered in the present work.
Therefore, in Fig. 4a plotted is the absolute value of the Nernst anisotropy divided by T to
account for the fact that the Nernst coefficient, being a measure of transverse entropy flow [26],
inevitably decreases with decreasing temperature. At the structural/magnetic transition |ŒîŒΩ|/T
changes abruptly in CaCo0 and CaCo3, perhaps due to a potent contribution to the Nernst
coefficient from the afore mentioned Dirac fermions or as a signature of the strong first order
character of the transition [8]. In contrast, |ŒîŒΩ|/T in CaCo7 seems to be unaffected by the
formation of the orthorhombic/SDW state. Notably, the character of the |ŒîŒΩ|/T temperature
dependence is shared among all the samples studied, and behaviour of |ŒîŒΩ|/T(T) is far from the
ùê∂
ùëá‚àíùëáùëê

form expected for the Curie-Weiss behaviour. The latter was suggested to be caused (with

some deviations) by critical fluctuations of the nematic state in iron-based superconductors
studied by means of elastoresistance measurements [12]. As a matter of fact, our data are much
better fitted by the equation proposed by I. Haller to describe behaviour of the nematic order
ùëá

parameter Q in liquid crystals [27]: ùëÑ = (1 ‚àí ùëá ‚àó)ùõΩ , where T* is a characteristic temperature
somewhat lower than the actual temperature of the discontinuous nematic-isotropic transition.
The actual fits:

|‚àÜùúà|
ùëá

ùëá

= ùõº(1 ‚àí ùëá ‚àó)ùõΩ have only two free parameters (Œ± and Œ≤) since T* values are

taken as the temperatures of the Nernst anisotropy onset (Fig. 2c). Here Œ± is the proportional
constant and Œ≤ is the pseudo-critical exponent. Some deviations from the fitting curves near T*
could be a result of the empirical nature of the Haller‚Äôs approximation equation, which is not
expected to be accurate close to the transition temperature [28].
The pseudo-critical exponent Œ≤ shown in Fig. 4b stays within the 1 - 4 range for
(Ca,Ba)(Fe1-xCox)2As2, which is about one order of magnitude higher in than values observed
in liquid crystals [27,28]. According to A. Ranjkesh et al. the pseudo-critical exponent is

in

(Ba,Co)(Fe1-xCox)2As2 seems to roughly obey this rule increasing with x (since growing
substitution of iron with cobalt leads inevitably to an increased disorder). Although, the data
scattering does not allow us to draw a definitive conclusion.
Here we would like to notice that the data from an analogous experiment performed on
YBa2Cu3Oy [15], presented in Fig 4c, can also be very well fitted with the Haller equation (this
time T* is taken as a free parameter). Such a universal behaviour of the |ŒîŒΩ|/T temperature
dependence along with the fact that |ŒîŒΩ|/T is unaffected by the structural/magnetic transition in
CaCo7 as well as in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 with x = 0.02 and 0.04 [13], suggests the anisotropy of
the Nernst coefficient might be a proxy of the electronic-nematic order parameter. This idea
was already considered by R. Daou et al. [16], which were inspired by the analogous proposition
by R.A. Borzi et al. [29] to define the phenomenological nematic order parameter in Sr3Ru2O7
as the in-plane anisotropy of the electrical resistivity. A remaining question is why we observe
in the thermoelectrical studies the broken rotational symmetry, which is inaccessible to
electrical measurements and vice versa ‚Äì that is, why the anomaly at the transition clearly
visible in ŒîœÅ(T) is absent in ŒîŒΩ(T)? While we cannot provide a firm answer, there are possible
scenarios that could explain such an intriguing behaviour. First, there are well known examples
of electronic systems with decoupled charge and entropy fluxes. One of them is the
superconducting state where Cooper pairs conduct charge without dissipation but do not
contribute in entropy transport. Another are small angle electron-phonon scattering processes,
which effectively disturb entropy transport with only little effect on the charge transfer.
Remarkably, the latter play an important role in strongly correlated electron system, where
charge transport could be described as the flow of a hydrodynamic electron fluid [30]. In such
a case the energy dissipation is dominated by momentum conserving small angle
electron-phonon scattering [31]. Therefore, if charge carriers in the electronic-nematic state

7

suffer from the anisotropic, but small-angle scattering, it will be seen in the anisotropy of the
Nernst effect, but be insignificant for the electrical resistivity measurements. A similar
phenomenon was recently observed in YBa2Cu3Oy and attributed to the emergence of the shortrange charge density wave modulations [15]. On the other hand, a possible reason why the
anomaly at the magnetic/structural transition is absent in the |ŒîŒΩ|/T temperature dependence
was proposed in Ref. 3. Namely, the large angle elastic scattering might cancel out for the
Nernst anisotropy which consists of contributions from both a- and b-direction transport. In
fact, ‚àÜùúà can be expressed as a subtraction of a two Sondheimer cancellations [32], one for adirection, another one for b-direction [13], and in metals the resulting difference might be
insignificant.

Conclusion
In summary, we show that in the phase diagram of iron-based superconductors, in a way
similar to their copper-based counterparts, there is room for another electronically driven
ordered state. Using the Nernst anisotropy as a proxy of the electronic-nematic order parameter
we indicate the emergence of the high temperature true nematic phase. Despite we are not able
to pinpoint its possible origin [8], we stress the role of the elastic and inelastic scattering in the
process. The electronic-nematic phase that arises at high temperature and can develop smoothly
despite the occurrence of the magnetic/structural transition. The present form of the phase
diagram does not exclude that the electronic-nematic phase ceases when the superconducting
critical temperature reaches its maximum, which would once again be a common behaviour for
iron-based and copper-based supercoductors [33]. Perhaps it might even suggest an intimate
relation between the electronic nematicity and superconductivity [34].
