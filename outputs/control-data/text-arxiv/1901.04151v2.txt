We investigate
√ the properties of electromagnetic fields in isobaric 44 Ru + 44 Ru and 40 Zr + 40 Zr
collisions at s = 200 GeV by using a multiphase transport model, with special emphasis on the
correlation between magnetic field direction and participant plane angle Ψ2 (or spectator plane
SP
angle ΨSP
2 ), i.e. hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i [or hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i]. We confirm that the magnetic fields of

collisions
are
stronger
than
those
of
Zr
+ 96
44
44
40
40 Zr collisions due to their larger proton
fraction. We find that the deformation of nuclei has a non-negligible effect on hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i
especially in peripheral events. Because the magnetic-field direction is more strongly correlated with
ΨSP
than with Ψ2 , the relative difference of the chiral magnetic effect observable with respect to
2
ΨSP
2 is expected to be able to reflect much cleaner information about the chiral magnetic effect with
less influences of deformation.

INTRODUCTION

Lattice QCD calculations predicted that quarks and gluons are deconfined with their partonic degrees of freedom
under the condition of high temperatures or the high baryon chemical potential, i.e., the formation of quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). Relativistic heavy ion collisions are believed to be able to reach the condition of creating the QGP.
On the other hand, a nonzero axial charge density of the QGP with a large magnetic-field B can lead to a dipole
charge separation along the B direction, i.e., the so-called chiral magnetic effect (CME), which results in a generation
of a vector current J [1–5],
J = σ5 B,

σ5 =

Qe
µ5 ,
2π 2

(1)

where σ5 is the chiral magnetic conductivity and µ5 is the chiral chemical potential arising from the nonzero axial
charge density.
To measure the CME signal, people usually measure charge azimuthal correlation [6–8] between two particles α
and β, which is defined as
γ = hcos(φα + φβ − 2ΨRP )i,

(2)

where φα and φβ are the azimuthal angles of two charged particles and ΨRP is the reaction plane angle, which is
usually represented by the second order of the event participant plane Ψ2 . From the CME expectation, the charge
azimuthal correlation ∆γ = γopp − γsame (the difference between opposite-pair and same-pair correlations) is expected
to be proportional to B 2 and cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 ) [9, 10], i.e.,
∆γ ∝ hB 2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i.

(3)

However, the current main difficulty of measuring the CME signal is some backgrounds which we do not understand
clearly [11–14]. For example, one of the difficulties of the CME observable interpretation is due to a large part of
background contribution stemming from the coupling of resonance decay correlations and the flow v2 arising from
participant geometry [15–17]. To isolate the influence of those backgrounds, the isobar program at the Relativistic
96
96
96
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has been proposed and it collides 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru and 40 Zr + 40 Zr elements since they have a
same nucleon number but the 10% difference in proton number. The same nucleon number indicates they should have
similar bulk backgrounds (e.g., flow), however, the different proton number means they carry different magnitudes

2
of magnetic fields. Therefore, the CME signal (due to the CME current J ) is expected to be different between the
two isobaric collisions, as illustrated by Eq. (1). There has been some interesting research on isobaric collisions, see
Refs. [10, 18–25].
If there are similar or even the same backgrounds in two isobaric collisions, the difference of the CME observable
between two isobaric collisions is expected to be mainly due to the differences from the squared magnetic field and
the correlation between magnetic-field direction ΨB and participant plane Ψ2 from Eq. (3). Meanwhile, because the
magnetic field is mainly induced by spectator protons, people also proposed to replace the participant plane Ψ2 with
the spectator plane ΨSP
2 , which is believed to be more strongly correlated with ΨB [23, 26]. In this paper, we focus on
not only the magnetic field, but also the two correlations between magnetic-field direction ΨB and participant plane
96
96
angle Ψ2 and between ΨB and the spectator plane angle ΨSP
2 . We systematically study 44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and
96
96
40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions by a multiphase transport model (AMPT) model. Based on the above, the implications of our
results to the future CME analysis in the isobaric experiment will be discussed.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we provide a brief introduction to the AMPT model, our isobaric
deformation settings, and the method to calculate magnetic fields. The numerical results for the properties of electromagnetic fields and some related correlations are presented and discussed in detail in Sec. III. Section IV contains
our conclusions.

GENERAL SETUP
A.

AMPT model

In this paper, we take advantage of a AMPT model [27] to investigate isobaric collisions. There are two versions
of the AMPT model, the default version and the version with a string-melting mechanism. Both versions contain
four important evolution stages of heavy ion collisions: initial state, parton cascade, hadronization, and hadron
rescatterings. They both use the HIJING model [28, 29] for generating the initial state of collisions. The main
difference between the two versions is that in the string-melting version, strings and minijets are melted into partons
so that there are more partons participating in the parton cascade than the default version. Therefore, the stringmelting version can better describe the cases when the QGP is produced, such as heavy ion collisions at the RHIC
and Large Hadron Collider energies. The string-melting version currently only considers elastic collision processes
between two partons [30], hadronization is simulated by a simple quark combination model, and hadron rescatterings
are described by a hadron transport model [31]. In this paper, we
√ choose the string-melting version to simulate
96

96
96

and
Zr

collisions
at
the
top

energy
of
s = 200 GeV. In our convention, we choose the

x axis along the direction of impact parameter b from the target center to the projectile center, the z axis along the
beam direction, and the y axis perpendicular to the x and z directions.
B.

Geometry configuration of isobaric collisions

96
For modeling 96
44 Ru and 40 Zr in the HIJING model, the spatial distribution of nucleons in their rest frame can be
written in the Woods-Saxon form (in spherical coordinates),

ρ(r, θ) = ρ0 /(1 + exp((r − R0 − β2 R0 Y20 (θ))/a)),

(4)

−3

where the normal nuclear density ρ0 = 0.16 fm , R0 is the radius of nucleus ( R0 = 5.085 fm for 96
44 Ru and R0
96
96
= 5.02 fm for 96
Zr),
a
is
the
surface
diffuseness
parameter,
and
β
is
the

of
nucleus.
For
2
40
44 Ru and 40 Zr,
96
96
the parameter a is almost identical, a ≈ 0.46 fm. At present, we can not confirm the β2 of 44 Ru and 40 Zr because
there are two cases of β2 [32] from e − A scattering experiments [33, 34] and comprehensive model deductions [35].
96
Ru
For the first case (denoted as case 1 thereafter), 96
=0.158 and β2Zr =0.08.
44 Ru is more deformed than 40 Zr, i.e., β2
Ru
However, the second case (denoted as case 2 thereafter) is the opposite, i.e., β2 = 0.053 and β2Zr = 0.217. As shown
in Ref. [10], the systematic uncertainty has little influence on the multiplicity distribution. We focus on its impact
on the CME signal of the correlator ∆γ. To cancel some theoretical uncertainties [10], we can take the ratio of the
96
relative difference between the two collisions. The definition of the relative ratio in a quantity Q between 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru
96
96
and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions is
RQ ≡ 2(QRu+Ru − QZr+Zr )/(QRu+Ru + QZr+Zr )

h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB −
If RQ is close to zero, it implies a similarity between two isobaric systems, however, it implies a big difference if RQ is far away from zero. For relative differences of deformation,

3
Rβ2 = 0.33 for case 1, but Rβ2 = −1.43 for case 2, which implies a larger deformation difference for case 2 than that
for case 1.
C.

Calculations of the electromagnetic field

Following Refs. [36–39], we use the same way to calculate the initial electromagnetic fields as
eE(t, r) =
eB(t, r) =

Rn − Rn vn
e2 X
(1 − vn2 ),
Zn
4π n
(Rn − Rn · vn )3
e2 X
vn × Rn
(1 − vn2 ),
Zn
4π n
(Rn − Rn · vn )3

(6)
(7)

where we use natural unit ~ = c = 1, Zn is the charge number of the nth particle, for the proton it is one, Rn = r − rn
is the relative position of the field point r to the source point rn , and rn is the location of the nth particle with velocity
96
vn at the retarded time tn = t−|r−rn |. The summations run over all charged protons in the system. For 96
44 Ru+ 44 Ru
96
96
collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions, we need to emphasize that most of our results about their electromagnetic field
are calculated at the field point r = (0, 0, 0) at t = 0.
D.

Calculations of the participant plane and the spectator plane

We calculate the participant plane Ψ2 by using the spatial distribution of partons from the string-melting mechanism
before the parton cascade process starts. The participant plane can be given by
Ψ2 =

hrp2 sin(2φp )i
1
[arctan 2
+ π],
2
hrp cos(2φp )i

(8)

where rp is the displacement of the participating partons from field point r = (0, 0, 0) and φp is the azimuthal angle
of the participating partons on the transverse plane [40, 41].
Following Refs. [17, 42, 43], we calculate the spectator plane as
ΨSP
=
2

1
hr2 sin(2φs )i
arctan 2s
,
2
hrs cos(2φs )i

(9)

where rs is the displacement of spectator neutrons only from one projectile from field point r = (0, 0, 0) and φs is
the azimuthal angle of spectator neutrons only from one projectile in the transverse plane. We check that our results
change little even if we use spectator protons. We choose spectator neutrons because the zero-degree calorimeters at
STAR Collaboration [44] only can measure neutrons. In the above two formulas, the bracket h· · ·i mean taking the
average over all participating partons or all spectator neutrons of projectile, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Spatial distributions of electromagnetic fields in isobaric collisions

Figure 1 shows the contour
√ plots of hBx,y,z i, h|Bx,y,z |i, hEx,y,z i and h|Ex,y,z |i at t = 0 on the transverse plane in
+ 96
s = 200 GeV for case 1 where the two upper panels are for b = 0 fm and the two lower
44 Ru collisions at
panels are for b = 8 fm. We find that h|Bx |i is far less than h|By |i at r = 0, what is more, the maximum of the magnetic
fields is in field point r = 0 for mid central collisions. hEx i peaks around (x, y) = (RRu + b/2 , 0) or (−RRu − b/2 ,
0), whereas hEy i peaks around (x, y) = (0 , ±RRu ) where RRu is the radius of the Ru nucleus. Meanwhile, we also
96
96
96
study the spatial distributions of electromagnetic fields in 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions for case 2 and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions
96
96
for case 1 and case 2. We find that their spatial distributions are similar to those in 44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions for case
96
96
96
1. Nevertheless, the fields for 96
40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions are with smaller magnitudes than those in 44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions
due to being with less protons everywhere basically.

model, whereas centrality and Ntrack are often used in experiments. We can easily find that the magnetic fields are
almost zero in most central events and have the maximum at some peripheral events, which indicate we should search
for the CME signals in peripheral collisions. Meanwhile, the average of the absolute value of electric fields gradually
decreases as centrality increases. These results are similar to the results of electromagnetic fields for Au+Au collisions
in shape, see Ref. [38]. Because the radius of the Ru nucleus is smaller than that of the Au nucleus, the maximum
96
of the magnetic fields is found in about b = 9 fm for 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions, and it is about b = 12 fm for Au+Au
collisions. What is more, the Ru nucleus has less protons than the Au nucleus, so the magnitudes of electromagnetic
fields for Ru+Ru collisions are smaller than those √
for Au+Au collisions. Figure 3 shows the electromagnetic fields
96
s = 200 GeV for case 2. We can see that the electromagnetic
in 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions at r = 0 and t = 0 at
fields of case 2 look almost identical with case 1. Similarly, Figs. 4 and 5 show the results of electromagnetic fields in
96
96
40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case 1 and case 2, respectively. (Note that the h|Bx |i and h|Ex,y |i look overlapped in Figs. 2

FIG. 7: (Color online) The relative√ratio of magnetic field as functions of (a) impact parameter b, (b) centrality, (c) Npart , and
(d) Ntrack in isobaric collisions at s = 200 GeV for case 1 and case 2.

96
Figure 6 shows the absolute value of the magnetic field in 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions for case 1 and case 2 and in
collisions for case 1 and case 2 as functions of b, centrality, Npart and Ntrack . We can clearly see that the
96
96
96
magnetic field in 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions is larger than that in 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions, and for both case 1 and case 2.
The magnitude of the magnetic field is almost the same between two cases for given isobaric collisions. In order to
96
96
96
find the discrepancy between 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions, we plot the relative ratio between the
96
two collisions as defined by Eq. (5). In Fig. 7, we can find the relative difference in B between 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions
96
96
and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case 1 is about 4% in central events and increases to 6% in peripheral events. However,
the relative difference for case 2 is about 4% in central events and gently decreases to 3% in mid-central events then
increases to 11.5% in peripheral events. Note that our relative difference of B for case 1 is similar to Refs. [19, 20].
96
96
96
It is easy to be understood that the electromagnetic fields of 96
40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions are smaller than 44 Ru + 44 Ru
collisions because they have less protons. Unquestionably, the difference of magnetic fields is vital for measuring the
CME and we indeed find differences in the magnetic fields between two isobaric collisions. Furthermore, we measure
the CME signal as mentioned above by using the correlator ∆γ. Because ∆γ ∝ h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB −Ψ2 )i has similar
flow due to the same atomic number, therefore it is key to check how different the hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i are between two
isobaric collisions, which will be discussed next.

FIG. 8: (Color
√ online) The event-by-event histograms of ΨB − Ψ2 at impact parameters b = 0, 4, 7, and 10 fm in 44 Ru + 44 Ru
collisions at s = 200 GeV for case 1. Here, ΨB is the azimuthal direction of the B field (at t = 0 and r = 0), and Ψ2 is the
second harmonic participant plane.

As the chiral anomalous effects always occur either along or perpendicular to the magnetic-field direction, it is
important to find an experimental way to determine the direction of the magnetic field. With the help of finite
correlation between ΨB and Ψ2 , ones fortunately are capable of accessing the magnetic field direction and then
measuring the CME. In Figs. 8 and 9 we plot the accumulated histograms of ΨB − Ψ2 at b = 0, 4, 7, and 10 fm in
96
96
96
96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions for case 1 and in 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case 1, respectively. For b = 0 fm, the histograms
of ΨB − Ψ2 are basically flat indicating that ΨB and Ψ2 are uncorrelated. For b = 4, 7, and 10 fm, the histogram
has a shape peaking at ΨB − Ψ2 = π/2 with corresponding widths. This implies some correlation exists between
ΨB and Ψ2 . Figures 10 and 11 show the corresponding two-dimensional correlation distributions for ΨB and Ψ2 in

44 Ru collisions and in 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case 1, respectively. For b = 0 fm, the events are almost
uniformly distributed, indicating a negligible correlation between ΨB and Ψ2 . For b= 4, 7, and 10 fm, the event
distributions evidently concentrate around ΨB − Ψ2 = π/2, indicating an existing correlation between the two angles.
96
Figure 12 shows that the correlation between magnetic field and participant plane Ψ2 in 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and
96
96
in 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case 1 and case 2 as functions of b, centrality, Npart and Ntrack . Obviously, the correlation
of hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i depended on centrality and these results are consistent with Figs. 8 - 11. In most central events
and most peripheral events, hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i is almost zero, due to large fluctuations. However, hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i has
96
96
96
a maximum about −0.5 for both 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions at b = 6 − 9 fm. The correlations for
96
96
96
the four cases look quite similar. Then, we also take the relative ratios between 96
44 Ru+ 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr
collisions for case 1 and case 2, which are shown in Fig. 13. We can see for case 1, the relative ratio of hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i
96
96
96
between 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions is about 5% in most central bins then decreases to −2% in
most peripheral bins. For case 2, the relative ratio of hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i is concave and about 7% in most central bins
and then increases to about 27% in most peripheral bins. In peripheral bins, one can see that the relative differences
of hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i for case 1 and case 2 differ a lot, which is actually caused by the deformation, i.e., the larger
deformation and the weaker correlation hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i for case 2 as shown in Fig. 12.

Figure 14 shows that the correlation h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i in 96

and 12, we can see that it is caused by both the magnetic field and the correlation. Following the same way, the relative
96
96
96
ratios of h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i between 96
44 Ru+ 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr+ 40 Zr collisions are presented in Fig. 15.
From Fig. 15(b), we can clearly see for case 1, the relative ratio is flat near 10%. But for case 2, the relative ratio shows
a clear increasing trend from central to peripheral events. By comparing the results from Figs. 7, 13, and 15, we find
the relative ratio of h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i is larger than the relative ratio of hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i, which indicates
96
that the magnetic field plays an important role on the CME observable. All the relative ratios between 96

in central and mid central events, but can not be neglected in peripheral events.

In the same way, we also take the relative ratio between 96
44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case
SP
1 and case 2, as shown in Fig. 17. The relative ratios of hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i for case 1 are gradually decreased from
around 5% to 0. Compared with Fig. 13, the relative ratios of hcos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i for both case 1 and case 2 are
close to zero for noncentral collisions. This indicates that there is little difference in the terms of hcos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i
between the two isobaric collisions for both cases for non-central collisions, thanks to the strong correlation between
ΨB and ΨSP
2 . It provides a natural advantage to detect the possible effects purely from the difference of magnetic
fields, even with less influence of the deformation.

Figure 18 shows that the correlation h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i in 44 Ru + 44 Ru collisions and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions for case 1 and case 2 as functions of b, centrality, Npart , and Ntrack . Note that compared to Fig. 14, the
magnetic field is the same, but cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 ) makes a difference. Because the magnetic field has a stronger
correlation with the spectator plane than the participant plane, h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i is stronger than

h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i. The relative ratios of h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP

and 40 Zr + 40 Zr collisions are presented in Fig. 19. For case 1, the ratio fluctuates near 15% which is similar to the
relative ratio of h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i. For case 2, the relative ratio increases from central to peripheral events
which is similar to the trend of h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i, but the magnitude is reduced from 40% to 20% for the
peripheral collisions.
Figure 20 gives a direct comparison between h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i and h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i as
functions of the centrality bin for case 1 and case 2. We find that the relative ratios of h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i
and h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i for case 1 are similar, because the deformation difference is relatively weak for
case 1. However, we observe that the two methods present different results for case 2, i.e., the relative ratio for the
participant plane is larger than the relative ratio for the spectator plane. Based on the above results, we have already
known that the correlation with the spectator plane is stronger than that with the participant plane. Therefore,
2 2
h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i is mainly affected by the magnetic field, however, h(eB/mπ ) cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i is affected
by both magnetic field and hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i. It suggests that we can observe a much cleaner magnetic field effect of
CME with the correlation ∆γ with respect to the spectator plane than that with respect to the participant plane.

CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, we have utilized the AMPT model to investigate the properties

ratios of the magnetic fields are up to 10% for different centralities for case 1 and case 2. Furthermore, the cor2 2
SP
relations hcos 2(ΨB − ΨSP
2 )i and h(eB/mπ ) cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i are all much stronger than hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i and
2 2
h(eB/mπ ) cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i for the two isobaric collisions. Moreover, deformation does affect the CME signals in isobaric collisions, especially for peripheral events in which the larger deformation leads to the weaker hcos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i
and h(eB/m2π )2 cos 2(ΨB − Ψ2 )i. For case 1, the relative difference with respect to the spectator plane and that with
respect to the participant plane look similar due to their small relative deformation difference. For case 2, the two
relative differences look different due to their larger deformation difference. Since ΨSP
2 has a much stronger correlation with ΨB than Ψ2 , the ∆γ correlator with respect to ΨSP
2 is expected to reflect much cleaner information about
the CME signal due to different magnitudes of magnetic fields between two isobaric collisions with less influences of
deformation.
