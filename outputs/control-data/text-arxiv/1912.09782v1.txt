Entanglement and Excitations in Gauge/Gravity Duality
by Ronald James Rodgers

Gauge/gravity duality, also known as holography, relates quantum field theories to
theories of gravity. When one theory is strongly coupled, and therefore difficult to
study directly, the other is weakly coupled. In this thesis, we study a variety of phenomena in strongly coupled quantum field theories by performing calculations in their
gravitational duals.
We compute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic systems, paying particular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term proportional
to surface area. This term is known to decrease along Lorentz-invariant renormalisation group flows, suggesting that it may count massless degrees of freedom. We find
that more general deformations may increase this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of long-distance degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between
this enhancement and the emergence of new scaling symmetry at long distances.
Next, we study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic model of a
non-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations includes
hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that sound-like modes
also exist at low temperatures. Such modes are known as holographic zero sound. We
study the changing properties of holographic zero sound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we vary the parameters of the model. We find
that for certain values of the parameters, the temperature-dependence of holographic
zero sound qualitatively resembles that of a normal Fermi liquid.
Finally, we study the entanglement entropy contribution of surface defects in a sixdimensional quantum field theory of relevance to M-theory, which is a candidate theory
of quantum gravity. We find that the entanglement entropy does not montonically
decrease along renormalisation group flows on these defects, ruling it out as a potential
measure of degrees of freedom. On the other hand, we find that two of the contributions
of the defect to the Weyl anomaly of the quantum field theory decrease along all of the
flows that we study.

Introduction

Chapter 1

Motivation
Quantum field theory (QFT) is a framework which successfully models many systems
in particle and condensed matter physics. However, exact calculations in all but the
simplest QFTs are impossible. To make progress, the traditional tool is perturbation
theory, an expansion in the coupling constants of the theory, which works extremely
well for many theories. Some QFTs, though, have large coupling constants, in which
case one cannot hope to obtain a good approximation by truncating the perturbative
series at a finite number of terms. Such QFTs are known as strongly coupled.
Examples of strongly coupled systems in nature are the quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) sector of the Standard Model, and condensed matter systems such as ultracold
Fermi gases and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To study such systems,
tools other than perturbation theory are needed.
One approach is numerical calculation, in particular lattice Monte Carlo simulation.
This is an active and productive field of research. For example, lattice QCD calculations
accurately reproduce the spectrum of light hadronic particles [7], and are essential in
the computation of hadron decay constants [8]. However, precise lattice simulations are
computationally expensive. In addition, the sign problem1 makes it difficult to simulate
systems at non-zero chemical potential, limiting applications to strongly interacting
condensed matter systems, heavy ion collisions, and neutron stars.
Gauge/gravity duality [10] provides a complementary tool for studying strongly
interacting QFTs. Also known as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT)
correspondence or holography, it relates QFTs in d-dimensional spacetime to quantum
gravity in (d+1)-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime. When the QFT is strongly
coupled, the corresponding theory of gravity is weakly coupled, and therefore amenable
to perturbative methods. In chapters 4 and 5 we will use the duality to study models
of strongly coupled condensed matter systems.
One obstacle to this programme is that quantum gravity is poorly understood.
Straightforward attempts to quantize general relativity fail, as the theory is nonrenormalisable. Even string theory, an ultraviolet-finite theory of quantum gravity,

is not well understood on spacetime with AdS asymptotics. In order to carry out
calculations, one therefore usually takes the classical limit of the gravitational theory.
The resulting dual QFT has an unrealistically large number of degrees of freedom,
in a sense that will be made more precise in chapter 2. Thus, at present, gauge/gravity
duality may not be used to make quantitative predictions for observables in real physical
systems. However, one can attempt to make qualitative predictions about strongly
coupled systems by looking for phenomena which are universal in holographic models,
which may then be generic to strongly coupled systems.
Perhaps the most striking success of this approach comes from the hydrodynamics
of holographic fluids. When the gravitational side of the duality is classical Einstein
gravity, possibly coupled to matter, the ratio of the shear viscosity η to entropy density
s in holographic models takes the universal value η/s = 1/4π ≈ 0.08 [11–15].2 This

ratio is very small compared to that for familiar fluids. For example, at a temperature
of 300K and atmospheric pressure, η/s ≈ 12 or 300 for water or nitrogen, respectively.3

On the other hand, η/s ≈ 0.5 has been observed in ultracold Fermi gases [17–19], and
heavy ion collision experiments place an upper bound of η/s . 0.15 for the quark-gluon

plasma [20]. The universal holographic result may therefore be viewed as a successful
prediction that η/s may be small in strongly coupled fluids, of which the ultracold gases
and quark-gluon plasma are examples.
In chapter 6 we will use gauge/gravity duality for a different purpose: to learn
about quantum gravity. The strong-coupling limit of type IIA string theory is an
eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory, which is yet to be fully formulated [21]. Mtheory contains extended six-dimensional objects, M5-branes, which are described by
a QFT that appears to have no classical limit. This makes M5-branes very challenging
to study. In chapter 6, we will use gauge/gravity duality to calculate observables in the
M5-brane QFT.

2
Throughout this thesis I use natural units in which the reduced Planck constant ~, the speed of light
c, and Boltzmann’s constant kB are all set equal to one. In this case η/s is dimensionless. Otherwise,
the dimensionless ratio is ~η/kB s.
3
These values were calculated using tables found at [16].

Gauge/gravity duality
In this section we provide a brief review of gauge/gravity duality. For more details we
refer to the books [22–24] and review [25]. Before defining the duality in section 2.4,
we will review aspects of conformal field theory, string theory, and AdS space, which
will be needed for the statement of the duality, and for understanding later chapters of
this thesis.

2.1

Conformal field theory

Many examples of holographic dualities involve conformal field theories (CFTs), which
are field theories invariant under conformal transformations. A conformal transformation is a coordinate transformation x → x0 such that the metric changes by an overall

scale factor Ω2 (x) [26, 27]

0
gµν (x) → gµν
(x0 ) = Ω2 (x)gµν (x),

(2.1)

followed by a Weyl transformation which removes the scale factor. Conformal transformations change the lengths of vectors while preserving the angles between them.
In d-dimensional Minkowski space, where gµν = ηµν , for d ≥ 3 conformal transfor-

mations form the group SO(d, 2). They consist of:

1. Poincaré transformations: translations xµ → xµ +aµ and Lorentz transformations

xµ → Λµ ν xν , with a ∈ Rd and Λ ∈ SO(d, 1). The Minkowski metric is invariant

under such coordinate transformations, i.e. Ω = 1 in equation (2.1).

2. Dilatations xµ → λxµ , with λ ∈ R+ . For these transformations Ω = λ−1 .
3. Special conformal transformations, xµ →
satisfy Ω = 1 + 2b · x + b2 x2 .

The Weyl anomaly

The trace of the stress tensor Tµν in a classical CFT vanishes when the equations of
motion are satisfied. To see this, consider an infinitesimal conformal transformation
with Ω(x) = 1 − (x), with (x)  1. By definition, the action of a CFT is invariant

under such a transformation. A coordinate transformation is not a physical transformation, so any change in the action must come from the Weyl transformation, which
acts as gµν → (1 + 2)gµν . The Weyl transformation also acts on the set of fields {Φa }

as Φa → (1 − ∆a )Φa , where ∆a is a constant, called the conformal dimension of the
field Φa . The change in the action S is then

By definition, the variation (2.2)

(2.3)

In QFT, the vanishing trace of the stress tensor is the Ward identity of conformal
invariance. Conformal invariance often becomes anomalous upon quantization of a
theory; if any couplings have non-vanishing beta functions then scale invariance is
broken by the renormalisation scale. For example, four-dimensional U(1) Yang-Mills
theory coupled to massless charged particles is classically a CFT. In the quantum
theory, one finds [28]
hT µ µ i =

β(e)
Fµν F µν ,
2e3

(2.4)

where β(e) is the beta function for the gauge coupling e, and Fµν is the background
value of the field strength.
Even when conformal invariance is preserved upon quantization, hT µ µ i generically

does not vanish when the theory is placed on a curved manifold, with contributions
coming from contractions of the Riemann curvature. In this case, non-vanishing hT µ µ i

is known as the Weyl anomaly. Since the scaling dimensions of the stress tensor and
curvature are respectively [T ] = d and [R] = 2, by dimensional analysis the Weyl
anomaly vanishes when d is odd. The general form of the anomaly for even d is determined by solving the Wess-Zumino consistency condition [29], which states that the
commutator of two Weyl transformations acting on the generating functional vanishes.
The result is that a theory with hT µ µ i = 0 in flat space has [30]
hT µ µ i = aEd +

in curved space, where Ed is the Euler class in d dimensions, the integral of which gives

the Euler characteristic.1 The In are contractions of products of the Riemann tensor
and the Laplacian that transform homogeneously under conformal transformations as
In → Ω−d In when gµν → Ω2 gµν . The anomaly is parameterised by theory-dependent

coefficients a and cn . Ref. [30] classified the contributions to the Weyl anomaly into
√
types A and B. Type A contributions to −ghT µ µ i transform as total derivatives

under Weyl transformations, while type B contributions are Weyl invariant. In (2.5),
the Euler density term is type A, while the In terms are type B.2
For example, in two dimensions the Euler class is proportional to the Ricci scalar,
E2 = R/4π, and there are no In . The Weyl anomaly in two dimensions is then [31]
hT µ µ i = −

R,
24π

(2.6)

where c = −6a is the central charge of the CFT.

Roughly speaking, c counts the degrees of freedom in the CFT. For example, the

thermodynamic entropy of a two-dimensional CFT on an interval of length ` at temperature T  1/` is S = πcT `/3 [32, 33], which is proportional to c. Consider a

two-dimensional RG flow between ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) fixed points, with

central charges cUV and cIR , respectively. The central charges satisfy a monotonicity
theorem, the c-theorem [34], which implies that there is a function which interpolates
between cUV and cIR , decreasing monotonically along the RG flow. Intuitively, this
function decreases as degrees of freedom are integrated out along the RG flow.
Similarly, in four dimensions there is the a-theorem [35–38], a monotonicity theorem
that guarantees that a, the type A anomaly coefficient in (2.5), decreases along RG
flows. In odd dimensions there is no Weyl anomaly. However, in three dimensions
the free energy on S3 is smaller in the IR than in the UV [39–41] (although it is not
always monotonic along the whole RG flow [42]). This is known as the F -theorem.
Monotonicity theorems are useful, for example, for ruling out possible IR fixed points
as the end points of RG flows [43].

2.1.2

Conformal defects

A defect in a QFT is a distinguished submanifold. For example, given a QFT with no
defect, one could insert a defect by imposing boundary conditions for the fields of the
QFT on a submanifold, or introducing new fields localised to it. A defect conformal
field theory (DCFT) is a CFT with a defect that preserves dilatation invariance (a
conformal defect).
In chapter 6, we will study properties of planar defects in a particular CFT. The
presence of an n-dimensional planar conformal defect breaks the conformal group
1
Note that (2.5) implies that correlation functions of T µ µ with one or more copies of the stress
tensor may be non-zero even in flat space, since these are constructed by taking functional derivatives
of hT µ µ i with respect to the metric.
2
In general, there may also be total derivative terms in (2.5). However, these may be removed by
the addition of local counterterms to the action.

SO(d, 2) into the SO(n, 2) × SO(d − n) subgroup that leaves the position of the defect

invariant. The SO(n, 2) factor consists of conformal transformations along the defect,
while the SO(d−n) factor consists of rotations about the defect. For the defects studied
in chapter 6, n = 2.
The Weyl anomaly of a defect CFT may include a contribution localised to the
defect. The general form of this contribution is not known for arbitrary n, however for
n = 2 one finds [44–46]

R(γ) is the Ricci scalar computed from γ, Π̊µab is the traceless part of the extrinsic
curvature of the defect, and Wabcd is the bulk Weyl tensor pulled back to the defect.

String theory, M-theory and supergravity
Superstring theory and supergravity

String theory was first developed as a possible theory of the strong interaction. The
latter was eventually realised to instead be described by quantum chromodynamics, but
interest in string theory has continued since it provides a rare example of a consistent
quantum theory of gravity. Later it was realised that string theory is a limit of another
theory, called M-theory [21, 49]. The original conjecture of gauge/gravity duality came
from string theory, and string and M-theory provide several concrete examples of the
duality [10]. We now review aspects of these theories relevant to this thesis. For further
details, we refer to refs. [22, 50, 51].
The fundamental objects of string theory are strings, two-dimensional (one space
and one time) objects. The fluctuations of strings are quantized, with different particles
corresponding to different fluctuation modes. The spectrum of fluctuations includes a
massless spin-2 field, the graviton, so string theory is a quantum theory of gravity.
There are five different supersymmetric string (superstring) theories, corresponding to different ways of implementing supersymmetry: types I, IIA, IIB, and SO(32)
3
The bulk Weyl tensor vanishes identically in three dimensions, so there is no d2 for a twodimensional defect in a three-dimensional CFT.

See also ref. [48] for an alternative proof of the b-theorem for the special case of two-dimensional
boundaries.

and E8 × E8 heterotic. Each of these theories must be formulated in ten-dimensional
spacetime to avoid an anomaly that would render the theory inconsistent [51].

String theory contains a single dimensionful parameter, the Regge slope α0 , of mass
dimension [α0 ] = −2. The massive string fluctuations have masses proportional to
√
√
1/ α0 . If we are interested in processes at energy scales small compared to 1/ α0 ,
we can therefore consider only the massless string modes, the massive modes having
decoupled. The resulting low-energy effective theory is ten-dimensional supergravity
(SUGRA). There are multiple ten-dimensional supergravity theories, corresponding to
low-energy limits of the different superstring theories. Of particular interest in this
thesis are type IIA and IIB SUGRA, each the low-energy limit of the string theory
with the same name, which contain the massless bosonic fields:
• the metric gµν ,
• a two-form gauge field Bµν ,
• a scalar field φ, called the dilaton, and
• n-form gauge fields Cn , with odd (even) n in type IIA (IIB) SUGRA,
in addition to the associated fermionic ten-dimensional N = 2 superpartners.

String theory contains dynamical extended objects, called D-branes. A Dp-brane

is a (p + 1)-dimensional extended object, electrically charged under the gauge field
Cp+1 ,5 on which open strings can end. The world volume of a D-brane supports a U(1)
gauge field. The endpoint of an open string is charged under this gauge field. For N
coincident D-branes, the gauge symmetry is enhanced to U(N ), and the endpoints of
strings transform in the fundamental representation.
In type IIA (IIB) string theory, Dp-branes with even (odd) p are stable. In supergravity, these D-branes are solitonic solutions of the classical equations of motion.
For example the solution of type IIB supergravity corresponding to a flat stack of N
coincident D3-branes is [52]

This means that the Dp-brane action contains a term proportional to the integral of Cp+1 over the
world volume of the brane.

2.2.2

M-theory and eleven-dimensional supergravity

It has been observed by Witten [21], based partly on the work of Hull and Townsend [53],
that at strong coupling, type IIA string theory looks like the compactification of an
eleven-dimensional theory on a circle, with a radius that grows with the string coupling. The eleven-dimensional theory has become known as M-theory [49]. In addition
to type IIA string theory, the four other superstring theories arise from M-theory in
different limits.
The “M” in M-theory is often taken to stand for membrane, because the theory
describes (2 + 1)-dimensional membranes, called M2-branes.6 In the compactification
of M-theory on a circle, type IIA fundamental strings arise from M2-branes wrapping
the compact extra dimension. M-theory also contains (5 + 1)-dimensional extended
objects, called M5-branes.
The low energy limit of M-theory is eleven-dimensional supergravity (11D SUGRA).
The fields of 11D SUGRA are the metric G, a three-form gauge field C3 , and a gravitino. The requirements of diffeomorphism invariance, local Lorentz invariance, local
supersymmetry, and invariance under gauge transformations of C3 completely fix the
action, the bosonic part of which is [22]

Anti-de Sitter space

Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is the maximally symmetric spacetime of constant negative
curvature. It arises in general relativity as a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant. This spacetime is crucially important in
gauge/gravity duality, so we will briefly review some of its properties. The discussion
follows that of [24].
One way to obtain (d + 1)-dimensional AdS (AdSd+1 ) is by an embedding in R2,d .
Denoting the coordinates and metric of R2,d as X̃ M and η̃M N respectively, AdSd+1 of
radius L is the hypersurface η̃M N X̃ M X̃ N = −L2 . The isometry group of AdSd+1 , made
manifest by this embedding, is SO(d, 2). This is the d-dimensional conformal group.

In this thesis we will typically work in a coordinate patch of AdSd+1 called the
Poincaré patch, the metric on which may written as
ds2 =


L2
dz 2 + ηµν dxµ dxν ,
2
z

(2.11)

where ηµν is the d-dimensional Minkowski metric and z ∈ [0, ∞). AdS has a conformal

boundary, consisting of a copy of d-dimensional Minkowski space at z → 0, with the
addition of the point at z → ∞ [56]. This latter point is known as the Poincaré horizon.

At the boundary, the SO(d, 2) isometries of AdSd+1 act on the xµ coordinates in the
same way as the conformal transformations listed in section 2.1.
AdS arises in supergravity as the near horizon region of the stacks of coincident
branes that were discussed in the previous section. For example, in the near-horizon
(r  L) region of the D3-brane solution (2.8), the metric and gauge field take the form

Defining a new coordinate z ≡ L2 /r, we recognise the metric in (2.12) as that of
AdS5 × S5 , where both AdS5 and S5 have radius L and the metric of AdS5 is in

the form (2.11). Similarly, the near horizon limit of the eleven-dimensional Mp-brane
solution (2.10) is AdSp+2 × S9−p .

Also relevant for gauge/gravity duality is asymptotically locally AdS (aAdS) space-

time, in which one may choose a coordinate system in which the metric takes the

Statement of gauge/gravity duality

Gauge/gravity duality is the equivalence between a d-dimensional QFT and a theory of
gravity on aAdSd+1 spacetime.7 This means there is a map between physical (gaugeinvariant) quantities in the two theories, and that the generating functionals of the
two theories are the same. Since quantum gravity is poorly understood, one normally
takes the classical limit on the gravity side, replacing the generating functional by its
saddle-point approximation. The duality is then [56, 58]
?

ZQFT [φ(0) ] = Zgrav [φ(0) ] ≈ e−Igrav [φ(0) ]

(classical limit).

(2.15)

The generating functional for the QFT, ZQFT , is a functional of the sources for the
operators in the QFT, collectively denoted by φ(0) . Each gauge invariant operator in
the QFT is dual to field in the gravitational theory. On the gravity side, the φ(0) are
boundary conditions for these fields. The right hand side of (2.15) is the classical saddle
? [φ ]
point approximation to the gravity generating functional Zgrav [φ(0) ], where Igrav
(0)

is the Euclidean-signature on-shell action, i.e. the action evaluated on the solutions to
the classical equations of motion. Throughout this thesis we use I and S to denote
actions in Euclidean and Lorentzian signatures, respectively. In Lorentzian signature,
?

the right hand side of (2.15) reads eiSgrav .
The gravitational action Igrav must in general include counterterms evaluated on the
aAdS boundary. These terms remove divergences in the on-shell action, which would
otherwise render the classical variational problem and the duality (2.15) ill-defined [59–
62]. The addition of these counterterms is known as holographic renormalisation, and
is the holographic analogue of renormalisation in the dual QFT.
One of the first examples of gauge/gravity duality was the conjectured equivalence
of N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with gauge group SU(N ) and type

IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5 [10]. We will use this to illustrate some important
aspects of the duality.

The correspondence between these two theories arises from consideration of the low
energy excitations of a stack of N coincident D3-branes in asymptotically flat space.
When the closed string coupling constant gs is small, there are two decoupled sets of
low energy modes, low energy closed strings propagating far from the branes, described
by type IIB SUGRA, and massless open strings ending on the branes. The latter
are described by four-dimensional N = 4 SYM theory with gauge group SU(N ), and
√
coupling gYM = 4πgs .8
7

The fact that the QFT lives in one dimension fewer than the gravity theory is why gauge/gravity
duality is also known as holography.
8
The gauge group describing N D3-branes is actually U(N ), however a U(1) subgroup corresponding

N{

D3-branes

Figure 2.1: Cartoon of the D3-brane stack that gives rise to the duality between N = 4
SYM and type IIB string theory. The arc is an open string, with both ends on the
stack. Such strings give rise to fields transforming in the adjoint representation of
SU(N ). The ellipse represents a closed string.

Alternatively, when gs is large, the appropriate description of the D3-branes is entirely in terms of closed strings. For large gs , the D3-branes curve spacetime, producing
a geometry with a horizon. Near the horizon is an AdS5 × S5 throat. Once more there

are two decoupled sets of low energy excitations. One set is again massless closed string
modes far from the branes, described by type IIB SUGRA. The other set of low energy
excitations consists of closed string modes moving in the near-horizon AdS5 ×S5 region.

These modes appear highly redshifted to an observer at infinity, so one must include
the full spectrum of near-horizon string states in the count of low energy excitations.

Now imagine we begin from the weakly coupled description in terms of weakly
coupled SYM (we neglect the decoupled closed strings from now on), and dial up gs
(and therefore gYM ). Yang-Mills theory is well defined for all values of gYM . Hence,
there is no clear reason for this description to break down at large gs , where we expect
the D-branes to be described by strings in AdS5 × S5 . The conjecture of ref. [10] is that
that both descriptions are equally valid, so that N = 4 SYM with gauge group SU(N )
is equivalent to type IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5 . The radius of both AdS5 and S5
are determined by the rank of the gauge group,

L = (4πα02 gs N )1/4 ,

(2.16)

where α0 is the Regge slope.
As described above, if we wish to be able to perform calculations on the string
theory side of the correspondence then we must take a classical limit. In addition,
string theory on curved backgrounds is poorly understood, so it is usual to take the
limit that string effects are small, in which case string theory is well approximated by
type IIB SUGRA.
The classical limit is that of weak coupling gs  1. Gauge/gravity duality relates

2
the Yang-Mills coupling gYM to the string coupling as gYM
= 4πgs , so the classical limit

to the centre-of-mass position of the branes decouples, and is ignored.

13

implies gYM  1.9 Since α0 determines the typical length scale of stringy effects, the
√
supergravity limit is L  α0 (i.e. the curvature is small in string units). From (2.16)

this implies that gs N  1. To satisfy both conditions we require N  1. In this limit

the strength of the coupling between fields in Yang-Mills theory is better described by
2 N , in terms of which the appropriate limits are:
the ’t Hooft coupling, λ = gYM

N → ∞, λ fixed

(classical limit)

λ→∞

(supergravity limit)

(2.17)

The SUGRA limit therefore implies that the dual Yang-Mills theory is strongly coupled.
When N is very large, N = 4 SYM has an extremely large number of degrees of

freedom. The field content of the theory is N 2 − 1 copies of the vector multiplet of
N = 4 SUSY, one for each generator of su(N ), so at large N the number of degrees

of freedom is proportional to N 2 . For example, the thermodynamic entropy density
s of N = 4 SYM at temperature T and large N is proportional to N 2 , explicitly

s = 21 π 2 N 2 T 3 at large λ [63]. The Weyl anomaly coefficients a and c (in d = 4 there is

only one type B anomaly) are also proportional to N 2 at large N [64, 65].
Since N = 4 SYM and type IIB SUGRA on AdS5 ×S5 are expected to be equivalent

descriptions of the same physics, the symmetries of the two theories should be the

same, and indeed they are. The bosonic symmetries of N = 4 SYM form the group
SU(2, 2) × SU(4). The SU(4) factor is the R-symmetry of N = 4 SUSY, while SU(2, 2)
arises because the theory is conformally invariant, SU(2, 2) being the double cover of

the four-dimensional conformal group SO(4, 2).
On the gravity side, the bosonic symmetries are the isometries of AdS5 × S5 , which

form the group SO(4, 2) × SO(6). Since type IIB SUGRA contains fermions, we should

again replace these groups with their double covers, yielding SU(2, 2) × SU(4), pre-

cisely the bosonic symmetry of N = 4 SYM. One can show that on accounting for
the fermionic symmetries, the full superalgebra is PSU(2, 2|4) on both sides of the
duality [22].
This illustrates a couple of general principles of gauge/gravity duality. One is
that gravity on AdS (as opposed to asymptotically AdS) is holographically dual to a
conformal field theory, since the isometries of AdSd+1 form the d-dimensional conformal
group. The other is that gauge symmetries on the gravity side are dual to global
symmetries on the QFT side; large gauge transformations,10 in this case isometries, act
as global transformations on the boundary.
The duality between N = 4 SYM and type IIB string theory has not been proven,

but a large body of evidence has accumulated in favour of its existence, with quantities
which can be computed on both sides of the duality matching exactly. Examples include
9
The string coupling constant is gs = eφ , where φ is the constant value of the dilaton in the D3-brane
solution

three point functions of half-BPS operators [66, 67] and the Weyl anomaly [64, 65].
As discussed above, the near horizon regions of M2- and M5-brane stacks are also of
the form of AdS ×S. Gauge/gravity duality is therefore expected to relate 11D SUGRA

on AdS4 × S7 and AdS7 × S4 to QFTs that describe the low-energy excitations of M2-

and M5-branes, respectively [10]. In the case of M2-branes, this QFT is maximally

supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theory, known as ABJM theory after Aharony,
Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena [68–72]. The QFT describing a stack of M5-branes
has not been formulated, but gauge/gravity duality provides a powerful tool for its
study. In chapter 6 we will use the duality to study defects in the M5-brane theory.

2.5

The holographic dictionary

In this subsection we review the relevant entries of the holographic dictionary, the map
between quantities in a QFT and its dual gravitational theory.
The radial coordinate z in (2.13) is identified with the renormalisation scale µ in the
QFT as µ ∼ 1/z. Approaching the boundary at z = 0 therefore corresponds to sending

µ → ∞, i.e. approaching the UV of the dual QFT, while z → ∞ corresponds to the IR
of the dual QFT. Since a QFT is usually defined by its UV behaviour, it is common to
think of the d-dimensional QFT as “living” at the boundary of the aAdSd+1 spacetime.
Equation (2.15) provides the recipe for computing correlation functions in a QFT
from its gravity dual. Given a set of operators Oi in the QFT, dual to fields φi , the

n-point correlation function of the Oi is determined by functional differentiation of the
on-shell gravity action with respect to the boundary values φi,(0) of the φi [56, 58],

each of the functional derivatives by i. One must also place the operator insertions
on the appropriate part of a Schwinger-Keldysh contour to obtain the desired time
ordering [73–76].
Consider a bulk field φ — for simplicity we consider a scalar field — dual to some
operator O of the boundary theory. The equation of motion for φ, which follows from
the action Igrav , will be second order in z derivatives, so two boundary conditions are
required. A series solution around z = 0 therefore takes the generic form
φ(x, z) = z d−∆ φ(0) (x) (1 + . . .) + z ∆ φ(2∆−d) (x) (1 + . . .)

Evaluating the z derivatives, one finds that this is satisfied provided ∆− is one of the
roots of (2.20).

We previously identified φ(0) with the source for the operator O. Dimensional

analysis shows that its mass dimension is [φ(0) ] = d − ∆, which is the appropriate
dimension for the source of O if the operator has scaling dimension ∆. Dimensional

analysis also implies that [φ(2∆−d) ] = ∆. A natural guess is that this coefficient is
related to the one-point function of O, and indeed applying the prescription (2.18), one

finds [59, 60]

hO(x)i = −(2∆ − d)φ(2∆−d) (x) + f [φ(0) (x)],

(2.25)

where f is a function of φ(0) (x) and its derivatives, the form of which depends on the
action Igrav .
The requirement that ∆ is the largest root of (2.20) is due to the CFT unitarity

one can instead choose ∆ to

be the smallest root of (2.20) while still satisfying the unitary bound [77].12
An important operator is the stress tensor T µν , the conserved current associated
to translational invariance. In gauge/gravity duality, translational invariance of the
boundary is dual to diffeomorphism invariance of the bulk, and so the stress tensor
is dual to the metric, GM N . In Fefferman-Graham gauge (2.13), where the metric
takes the near boundary expansion (2.14), we identify the leading coefficient g(0)µν as
the source for the stress tensor, i.e. the metric in the boundary theory. Correlation
functions of the stress tensor are then computed by functional differentiation with
respect to this boundary value. For example [59]

where the ellipsis denotes terms which depend on g(0) and other sources.
We note that there is an inherent ambiguity in the value of the boundary metric g(0)µν . For example, defining a new radial coordinate z 0 = Ωz with constant Ω,
transforms the metric (2.13) into

naturally read off the boundary metric as Ω2 gµν , in other words we have implemented
a constant Weyl transformation. General Weyl transformations may be performed by
allowing Ω to depend on x and z.
Because of this ambiguity, the “boundary metric” g (0) is really a representative
of a conformal class of metrics. The choice of representative is encoded in a defining
function f (x, z), which may be any positive function with a simple zero at z = 0. The
boundary metric is taken to be
lim f (x, z)2 G.

(2.28)

Changing the defining function holographically implements a Weyl transformation on
the boundary. Normally one chooses a defining function which is natural in a given
coordinate system. For example in the coordinate system (2.13) we chose f = z/L,
leading to the identification of g (0) as the boundary metric.

Applying the holographic dictionary, the leading coefficient µ is identified as the source
for the charge density, which is by definition the chemical potential. The subleading

Two-point correlation functions and quasinormal modes

In chapter 5 we will use holography to study two-point correlation functions of a QFT
at non-zero temperature, in particular the retarded Green’s function [81]
Gab (x1 − x2 ) = θ(t1 − t2 )hOa (x1 )Ob (x2 )i + θ(t2 − t1 )hOb (x2 )Oa (x1 )i,

(2.31)

where θ is the Heaviside step function, t1,2 is the time component of x1,2 , and (a, b)
index the operators of the theory. In writing Gab as a function of the separation x1 −x2 ,
we have assumed that theory is invariant under translations in space and time, as will
be the case for the model of chapter 5.
The retarded Green’s function Gab is physically significant in that it determines the
linear response of the operator Oa to a small change in the source of Ob [82],
δhOa (x)i ≈

Z

dd y Gab (x − y)δφ(0),a (y).

(2.32)

Let us take the Fourier transform of the retarded Green’s function,
Z
Gab (ω, k) =

dd x eiωt−ik·x Gab (t, x),

(2.33)

where x = (t, x). For a given momentum k, Gab (ω, k) will have poles in the complex
ω plane, at frequencies we denote ω = ω∗ (k). These poles correspond to unstable
propagating modes in the QFT, with frequency Re ω∗ and decay rate − Im ω∗ .13

In gauge/gravity duality, poles in the retarded Green’s functions of the boundary

theory are dual to the frequencies of quasinormal modes in the gravitational theory [73,
83], which are defined as follows.
Consider small fluctuations about a black brane solution of the gravitational theory,
holographically dual to a thermal state of the boundary QFT. Writing the fluctuation
of a field φa as φa → φa + δφa (t, x, z), we consider fluctuations of a single Fourier mode
for each field,14 schematically

δφa (t, x, z) = e−iωt+ik·x δφa (ω, k, z),

(2.34)

for some fixed frequency ω and momentum k. We seek solutions to the linearised
equations of motion for the Fourier modes which are:
1. Normalisable at the boundary. Each Fourier mode will have a near-boundary
expansion like (2.19) (with different values of ∆). We impose that the leading
coefficient at the boundary vanishes. Holographically, we are keeping the sources
for all operators fixed.
13

We assume that Im ω∗ < 0. If instead Im ω? > 0, the mode grows exponentially in time, indicating
an instability of the system.
14
Different Fourier modes decouple due to the translational invariance of the background solution.

19

2. Ingoing at the horizon. Near the horizon, there are two independent solutions to
the equations of motion for the fluctuations, corresponding to waves moving into
or out of the horizon. We choose boundary conditions such that the solution is
purely ingoing. Holographically, this means that the quasinormal modes correspond to poles of the retarded — as opposed to advanced — Green’s functions.
Solutions satisfying these boundary conditions generically exist only for a discrete set
of frequencies, at a given momentum. These frequencies are the quasinormal modes.
To compute the retarded Green’s functions Gab themselves, the method is as follows [73, 74, 84]. We consider fluctuations of the fields φa as above, writing the Fourier
transformed fluctuations as
Z
δφa (t, x, z) =

dd k ik·x
e Fab (k, z)z d−∆b δφ(0),b (k),
(2π)d

(2.35)

where ∆b is the dimension of the operator dual to φb , k = (ω, k), and Fab (k, 0) =
δab . We impose ingoing boundary conditions on Fab at the horizon. By construction,
δφ(0),a (k) is the Fourier transform of the perturbation in the source, δφ(0),a (x).
Substituting (2.35) into the linearised action for the fluctuations, one finds that
when the equations of motion are satisfied, the action may be written in the form
Z
S=

z=z
dd k 
δφ(0)a (−k)Fab (k, z)δφ(0)b (k) z=0H ,
d
(2π)

(2.36)

where zH is the location of the black brane’s horizon, and Fab depends quadratically

on Fab . The precise form of Fab is determined by the action of the gravitational theory.
The retarded two-point functions are given by

Gab = −2Fab (k, z = 0).

(2.37)

Notice that this is not what one would obtain by naive functional differentiation
of (2.36) with respect to the boundary values φ(0),a (k). However, ref. [74] showed
that (2.37) may be derived using functional derivatives in a more careful approach that
holographically implements the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism.

2.5.3

Wilson loops

In the duality between N = 4 SU(N ) SYM and type IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5 , a

Wilson line in the fundamental representation is holographically dual to a string which
reaches the boundary of AdS5 [85–87].
To see why, let us sketch the argument presented in ref. [85] and illustrated in
figure 2.2. Consider a stack of N + 1 D3-branes, holographically dual to N = 4 SYM

with gauge group SU(N + 1). If we now separate one of the branes from the others
by a distance ∆X i , this spontaneously breaks the gauge group to SU(N ) × U(1). The

Figure 2.2: (a): Cartoon of the holographic description of the spontaneous symmetry
breaking pattern SU(N + 1) → SU(N ) × U(1), in N = 4 SYM. The symmetry breaking
is caused by non-zero separation ∆X between one of the D3-branes and the other
N . Open strings which begin and end on the stack of N D3-branes correspond to
the “gluons”, the massless gauge bosons of the SU(N ) factor. Open strings stretched
between the separated branes correspond to “W bosons”, the gauge bosons which
acquire a mass proportional to ∆X due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. (b): In
the limit ∆X → ∞, the W bosons become infinitely massive. From the point of view
of the SU(N ) factor, which decouples from the U(1) in this limit, a W boson insertion
looks like infinitely massive quarks, i.e. a Wilson loop. Note that we have suppressed
the time direction in the figure.
W bosons correspond to strings stretched between the SU(N ) and U(1) branes. They
have mass proportional to |∆X|, the minimum length of such strings, and transform

in the fundamental representation of SU(N ).

In the limit |∆X| → ∞, the SU(N ) and U(1) factors decouple. The W boson strings

reach the boundary of the AdS5 region near the horizon of the SU(N ) branes. The

W bosons themselves become infinitely massive as |∆X| → ∞. Recalling the interpretation of the Wilson loop as the phase factor of a heavy charged particle travelling
around the loop, it is natural to expect that Wilson loops are holographically related
to strings ending on the boundary of AdS.
In fact, such a string is holographically dual to a Wilson loop operator modified by
a term depending on the N = 4 SYM scalar fields φi . The operator is [85]

where C ≡ x(s) is the contour defining the Wilson loop, P denotes path ordering,

and θi ≡ ∆X i /|∆X|. The trace is taken in the fundamental representation. If the

integration contour is a straight line or a circle, the operator (2.38) is known as the
half-BPS Wilson loop operator, since in either case it commutes with eight independent
linear combinations of the fermionic symmetry generators of N = 4 SYM, due to the

additional φi -dependent term [87, 88].

21

Half-BPS Wilson loops in representations other than the fundamental are dual to
configurations of multiple strings, one string for each box in the representation’s Young
tableau. However, when the number of strings is of order N , interactions between the
strings become important, and the appropriate holographic dual is instead a configuration of D3- and D5-branes [89–91], interpreted as a bound state of strings.

2.6

Probe branes

In this section we review the concept of probe branes, which feature in the holographic
models studied in chapters 5 and 6. Early examples of probe branes in gauge/gravity
duality appear in refs. [92–94].
Consider a D-dimensional gravitational theory, into which we embed a p-brane, i.e.
a (p + 1)-dimensional dynamical object. The full action is
Sgrav = Sbulk + Sbrane ,

(2.39)

where Sbulk is the action for the D-dimensional theory, and Sbrane is the action for the
brane. We assume that Sbrane is proportional to a tension Tp , and therefore so is the
contribution of the probe brane to the stress tensor ΘM N of the gravitational theory.
The probe limit is that of small tension in units of Newton’s constant,
τp ≡ Tp GN Lp+3−D  1.

(2.40)

In this limit, the contribution of the brane to the stress tensor is small compared to the
curvature terms in Einstein’s equations, and may be neglected to a first approximation.
One solves the equations of motion which follow from Sbulk to obtain a background solution, into which the probe brane is embedded. This will generate a series of corrections
to the bulk fields, which we denote collectively as g,
g = g (0) + g (1) + g (2) + . . . ,

(2.41)

where g (n) ∝ τpn , and g (0) is the background solution. These corrections are known as

the back-reaction of the brane.

We similarly expand other physical quantities as a series in the tension, for example
we write the on-shell action as
S ? = S (0) + S (1) + S (2) + . . . ,

(2.42)

where the S (n) ∝ τpn . The probe approximation provides a simple way to compute

S (1) , the leading order correction to the on-shell action of the background solution,
which in turn gives the leading order correction to the generating functional of the dual
QFT using (2.15). Let us write the on-shell action on the solution g as S ? [g]. Then,

The functional derivatives δSbulk /δg give the equations of motion for the bulk theory,
which vanish when evaluated on the background solution g (0) . Hence
S (1) = Sbrane [g (0) ],

(2.44)

so the leading order correction to the on-shell action is determined by evaluating the
action of the probe brane on the background solution. This provides a great simplification. However, care must be taken as not every quantity may reliably computed in this
way. For example, computing the energy density from the probe brane’s stress tensor
yields the wrong answer at non-zero temperature [95].
The presence of a probe brane in a holographic model often indicates the presence
of matter fields in the boundary QFT. To illustrate this, consider the D3-D7 system of
ref. [93].15 The background solution is AdS5 × S5 , generated by a stack of N D3-branes,

to which we add a stack of Nf coincident D7-branes described by the bosonic action [22]

The tension is T7 = Nf /((2π)7 gs α04 ), from which one finds that the probe limit (2.40)

is Nf  N ,16 i.e. the number of fundamental flavours is very small compared to the
rank of the gauge group.

Consider the AdS5 × S5 metric (2.12) with the metric on the S5 written as

Ref. [93] derived a family of embeddings by employing a static gauge in which the
D7-branes are parameterised by the xµ coordinates, the coordinates on the S3 , and
z ≡ L2 /r, taking an ansatz where F = 0, φ is constant, and θ = θ(z). With these

Figure 2.3: Cartoon of the D3-D7 system. The curves represent strings, which can
end on the branes. Strings which stretch between the D3- and D7-brane stacks give
rise to fields which transform under the (anti-) fundamental of SU(N ), and under the
(anti-) fundamental of a U(Nf ) global flavour symmetry, with masses determined by
the closest approach of the two stacks.

equation for θ has the solution sin θ = M z. At the boundary, the D7-brane fills
AdS5 and wraps an equatorial S3 ⊂ S5 . Moving into the bulk, the radius of the

wrapped S3 shrinks, eventually vanishing at z = 1/M . This is the maximal extent

of the D7-brane into the bulk. Expanding the solution for small z, one finds θ =
M z + M 3 z 3 /6 + O(M 5 z 5 ), indicating that θ is dual to a scalar operator O of dimension

∆ = 3 (with source ∝ M of dimension 4 − ∆ = 1). Holographic renormalisation reveals
that hOi = 0 for any value of M [97].

The holographic dual of the D3-D7 system can be understood as follows. As dis-

cussed above, the holographic dual of a stack of D3-branes is SU(N ) N = 4 SYM,

with the fields of the gauge multiplet intuitively arising from strings beginning and
ending on the D3-branes (commonly called 3-3 strings). The presence of the D7-branes
allows for two new types of string: 3-7 strings, with one endpoint on each stack, and
7-7 strings, with both endpoints on the D7-branes. In principle one would expect the
7-7 strings to give rise to a U(Nf ) gauge theory, but a consequence of the supergravity
limit is that the ’t Hooft coupling for this theory vanishes, so the 7-7 strings decouple
and may be ignored. The 3-7 strings therefore transform in the fundamental representations of a U(Nf ) global symmetry and the SU(N ) gauge symmetry. Analysis of
the preserved supersymmetry shows that the open string states form hypermultiplets
of four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetry. The different sorts of strings are sketched
in figure 2.3.

If the D3- and D7-branes are separated along some transverse direction, then the
3-7 strings have a minimum length. This gives a non-zero mass to the N = 2 hyper-

multiplet, given by the separation multiplied by the string tension. The separation,
and therefore the mass, is proportional to the integration constant M in the solution

described above. The operator O, dual to θ, is a linear combination of bilinears of the

fermion and scalar fields that compose the N = 2 hypermultiplet.

Chapter 3

Entanglement entropy
In chapters 4 and 6 we will use gauge/gravity duality to calculate entanglement entropy
in a variety of systems. We now review the definition of entanglement entropy, and
how it is calculated holographically. For further details, see refs. [98, 99].

3.1

Definition and properties

The state of a quantum system may be specified by an operator called the density
matrix, ρ̂. A system in a state |ψi is said to be in a pure state. The density matrix in
this case is ρ̂ = |ψihψ|. However, the state of a physical system is not normally known

with absolute certainty. Given a basis {|ni}, if we assign a classical probability pn that
P
the system is in the state |ni, the density matrix is ρ̂ = n pn |nihn| [100]. When the
density matrix may not be expressed as |ψihψ|, this is called an impure or mixed state.
The expectation value of an operator O in a state with density matrix ρ̂ is
hOi = tr (ρ̂O) =

X
n

pn hn|O|ni.

(3.1)

Suppose the Hilbert space H of a system may be decomposed into a tensor product

structure, H = A ⊗ Ā. We will refer to the subspace A as the entangling region. The

reduced density matrix on A, ρ̂A , is defined by tracing out the states in its complement
ρ̂A ≡ trĀ ρ̂ ≡

X

hb|ρ̂|bi.

(3.2)

|bi∈Ā

The entanglement entropy SE of A is the von Neumann entropy associated to ρ̂A ,
SE [A] ≡ − trA (ρ̂A ln ρ̂A ) ,

(3.3)

see ref. [98], for example. If the total density matrix ρ̂ describes a pure state, then the
entanglement entropy satisfies SE [A] = SE [Ā].

Entanglement entropy is a quantitative measure of the entanglement between the
25

entangling region and its complement. For example, consider the case when A and Ā

are single qubits, each with possible states |0i and |1i. If the system is in the state
|ψi = cos θ|0iA |1iĀ + sin θ|1iA |0iĀ ,

(3.4)



then the entanglement entropy is SE [A] = − cos2 θ ln cos2 θ − sin2 θ ln sin2 θ [101].

This vanishes when θ = 0 or π/2, corresponding to when (3.4) is a product state. The

entanglement entropy is maximal for θ = π/4, in which case (3.4) is the maximally
√
entangled state |ψi = (|0iA |1iĀ + |1iA |0iĀ ) / 2.
In a QFT, the Hilbert space may be taken as the set of states on a given Cauchy
surface, roughly speaking a spatial slice at a single instant in time. It is therefore natural
to divide the Hilbert space geometrically, by choosing A to be a spatial subregion on

the Cauchy surface. We will assume that the Hilbert space factorises into the tensor
product structure H = A ⊗ Ā necessary for the definition of entanglement entropy.1
Throughout this thesis we will use two different geometries for the subregion A,

which we will call the sphere and the strip. In the sphere geometry, A is the interior
of a sphere of radius `. In the strip geometry, A is the region between two parallel
planes, separated by a distance ` along a direction we denote x1 . Choosing coordinates
for d-dimensional flat space such that the metric is
ds2 = −dt2 + dxi dxi ,

(3.5)

we take t = 0 as the Cauchy surface. The sphere and strip geometries are

Sphere: A = xi | xi xi ≤ `2 ,

Strip: A = xi | − `/2 ≤ x1 ≤ `/2 .

(3.6)

Both geometries are sketched in figure 3.1. We have chosen to work with the sphere
and strip geometries because they are invariant under subgroups of the SO(d − 1, 1)
isometries of Minkowski space, simplifying calculations.

Entanglement entropy in QFT is UV divergent, due to contributions from near the
boundary of A. We will regularise this divergence with a short distance cutoff . The
leading order divergence is typically proportional to the area of the boundary ∂A of
the entangling region [103, 104],
SE ∝

Area[∂A]
+ ... ,
d−2

(3.7)

where the ellipsis indicates terms which are subleading as  → 0. When d = 2, there is

instead a logarithmic divergence; the entanglement entropy of a connected subregion

This assumption is not always true, see, for example, the discussion in ref. [102].

The logarithm of ρ̂A appearing in (3.3) makes it difficult to calculate the entan-

glement entropy directly. However, computation of the logarithm can be avoided by a

method known as the replica trick, which works as follows [105, 106]. Let us define the
qth Rényi entropy [107]
Sq ≡

1
ln tr ρ̂qA .
1−q

(3.9)

In the limit q → 1, this reduces to the entanglement entropy (3.3).2 The trace appearing
in (3.9) may be evaluated for integer q by performing a path integral on a manifold

consisting of q copies of the original manifold, sewn together along the entangling region
A. One then analytically continues to non-integer q and takes the limit q → 1 to obtain
the entanglement entropy.

Of course, evaluating the path integral on the replicated manifold is not trivial,
and will be intractable for strongly coupled theories. As we review in the next section, gauge/gravity duality provides a relatively simple alternative way to calculate
entanglement entropy in holographic QFTs.

2

Other interesting limits of the Rényi entropies are q → 0, which measures the number of non-zero
eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, and q → ∞, which measures the largest eigenvalue. See
[108] for a detailed discussion on these limits in QFTs.

Holographic calculation of entanglement entropy
The Ryu-Takayanagi prescription

The holographic dual of entanglement entropy in time-independent systems was proposed by Ryu and Takayanagi (RT) [109, 110]. Thinking of the QFT as living on the
boundary of AdS, a partition into subspaces A and Ā is a partition of a constant time

slice of the boundary. To compute the entanglement entropy, one must find the bulk
surface S of minimal area which is homologous to A and shares the same boundary,
∂S = ∂A. The entanglement entropy of A is proportional to the area of this surface,
SE [A] =

Area[S]
.
4GN

(3.10)

This formula is reminiscent of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula (2.29) for the thermodynamic entropy of a black hole, with the area of the event horizon replaced by the
area of the minimal surface S. The various surfaces in this prescription are sketched in
figure 3.2.

The RT prescription was proved by Lewkowycz and Maldacena (LM) [111], assuming the validity of an analytic continuation which was used to implement the replica
trick holographically, as described in section 3.2.3. The generalisation of the RT prescription to time-dependent systems was proposed in ref. [112], and derived by a generalisation of the LM construction in ref. [113].
The entanglement entropies for the sphere and strip geometries in a d-dimensional
CFT holographically dual to AdSd+1 were computed in [109, 110]. For the strip geometry, the result is

The Casini-Huerta-Myers method

For a holographic CFT, there is an alternate method for calculating the entanglement
entropy of a spherical geometry, due to Casini, Huerta, and Myers (CHM) [114]. This
method was developed as a step toward proving the RT prescription, and is also a
useful calculational tool. The prescription is as follows.
The modular Hamiltonian H is a Hermitian operator, defined as
H ≡ − ln ρ̂A ,

(3.15)

which generates a symmetry of the subsystem A,3

tr ρ̂A e−iHs OeiHs = tr(ρ̂A O),

(3.16)

where O is any operator defined on A, and s ∈ R. Causality requires that the algebra

of operators inside the causal development D of A is closed under such transformations

[114]. The causal development of A is the set of spacetime points p such that any causal

which pass through q but do not intersect A, the dotted line being an example.

path through p necessarily intersects A, see figure 3.3. The causal development for a
spherical entangling region of radius ` at t = 0 is the region satisfying
x± ≡ r ± t ≤ `,

(3.17)

where we use a spherical coordinate system with radius r. Under the modular flow (3.16),

In a CFT, for a spherical entangling region the modular Hamiltonian is a local
operator. In this special case, the flow generated by e−iHs is x± → x± (s) with all other
coordinates invariant, where [114]

x± (s) = `


sides of (3.20) imply x± = ` tanh u±τ

2

the causal development D of the spherical entangling region.

This conformal transformation to hyperbolic space maps the modular flow (3.19)

to time translation, τ → τ + 2πs. The periodicity relation (3.18) shows that hyperbolic

space correlation functions are periodic under imaginary time translations, τ ∼ τ + 2πi,
which is the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition of statistical mechanics (see ref. [81],

for example). In hyperbolic space the CFT is therefore in a thermal state, at inverse
temperature β = 2π, implying that the reduced density matrix may be written as
ρ̂A =

1 −1 −2πHτ

U,
Z

(3.22)

where Z ≡ tr e−2πHτ , Hτ is the Hamiltonian generating translations in τ , and U is the
unitary operator implementing the conformal transformation to hyperbolic space on
states in A.

Substituting the reduced density matrix (3.22) into the entanglement entropy (3.3),

all factors of U cancel,
SE =


2π
tr Hτ e−2πHτ + ln Z.

(3.23)

The right hand side of (3.23) is precisely the thermodynamic entropy in the hyperbolic

space at β = 2π, since tr Hτ e−2πHτ /Z is the energy and − ln Z/2π is the free energy.

We thus arrive at a key result of ref. [114]: the entanglement entropy of a spherical
region A in a CFT is equal to the thermodynamic entropy of that CFT on hyperbolic
space at β = 2π.

In holography, the conformal transformation to hyperbolic space is implemented by
a bulk diffeomorphism and a change in defining function. Starting from AdSd+1 in flat
slicing, with metric (2.11), we perform the coordinate transformation

as desired. If we take the natural defining function in these coordinates, 1/Lv, then
the boundary metric is precisely that of R × Hd−1 .

The boundary of AdS may also be approached by fixing v and τ , and sending

u → ∞, which sends (t, r) → (0, `), or by fixing v and u, and sending τ → ±∞, which

The orange surfaces in the figure on the right are the slices of constant u in the space

sends (t, r) → (±`, 0). These are the corners of the causal development D.
The coordinate system (3.25) does not cover all of the Poincaré patch of AdS. The
horizon at v = 1 is part of the boundary of the covered coordinate patch. From (3.24),
we see that in terms of the flat slicing coordinates the horizon is the surface r2 + z 2 =
`2 at t = 0, which is precisely the RT surface for the sphere geometry [109, 110].
The coordinate patch covered by the hyperbolic slicing is the region known as the
entanglement wedge [115], which in general is defined as the causal development of the
region bounded by the RT surface at t = 0. For the sphere geometry in pure AdS, this
√
region is r2 + z 2 ± t ≤ `. Figure 3.4 illustrates how the hyperbolic slicing covers this

coordinate patch.

As discussed above, the entanglement entropy of the spherical region in the boundary theory is given by the thermodynamic entropy in hyperbolic space. Holographically,
the thermodynamic entropy is proportional to the area of the horizon at v = 1, according to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula (2.29). Since the horizon coincides with the RT
surface, this proves the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription (3.10) for the special case of the
sphere geometry in a CFT.
The map to hyperbolic slicing also provides a convenient method for calculating the
Rényi entropies Sq , as follows [108, 116]. Substituting the reduced density matrix (3.22)
into the Rényi entropy (3.9) one finds again that all factors of U cancel,
Sq =

where F (β) = −β −1 ln Z(β) is the free energy in hyperbolic space at inverse temperature β.

To compute (3.27) holographically, we require the geometry holographically dual to
the CFT in hyperbolic space at arbitrary temperature. For the cases of interest in this

Casini-Huerta-Myers and probe branes

where SE

∝ τpn . The first term, SE , is the entanglement entropy computed in the

absence of the probe brane.

(1)

Suppose we wish to compute the leading correction, SE . The RT prescription (3.10)
(1)

implies that SE is proportional to the leading order change in the area of the minimal
surface S in the presence of the brane. Since the area of S is determined by the metric,
(1)

naively one cannot compute SE without calculating the back-reaction of the brane —

often a difficult problem.
One way to compute the entanglement entropy without directly computing the
back-reaction of the brane was found by the authors of ref. [117], who showed that
(1)

SE is equal to a certain double integral over the world volume of the RT surface at
τp = 0 and the world volume of the probe brane. However, this integral is not easy to
compute, in general.
For probe branes dual to planar, conformal defects, the CHM method provides
33

(1)

a convenient way to compute SE in the sphere geometry, without computing backreaction or a double integral [118]. The restriction that the defect is planar and conformal is necessary for the generalisation of the CHM proof in the presence of the defect.
Holographically, these restrictions mean that the probe brane has an AdSp+1 world
volume inside AdSd+1 , and that the brane’s world-volume fields do not depend on the
radial coordinate in this AdSp+1 subspace.
If these conditions hold, then the Rényi entropy contribution from the probe brane
may be computed from (3.27). Expanding this formula in powers of the brane tension,
and equating the O(τp ) terms, we find
Sq(1) =

i
2πq h (1)
F (2π) − F (1) (2πq) ,

(3.31)

where as usual the superscripts denote powers of τp . The right hand side depends only
on the leading order contribution of the brane to the free energy, which we argued
in section 2.6 may usually be computed in the probe limit without needing the backreaction of the brane. One may then compute the entanglement entropy by taking the
q → 1 limit of (3.31), or equivalently
(1)

SE = β 2

While useful, this method suffers from the restriction that the probe brane must
preserve defect conformal symmetry. In the next section we discuss how the method
may be adapted to relax this condition [119].

3.2.3

Generalised gravitational entropy

Lewkowycz and Maldacena have developed a quantity called generalised gravitational
entropy [111]. Consider a gravitational theory on a Euclidean-signature manifold with
a boundary. We suppose that the boundary geometry has a direction which is topologically a circle, parameterised by a coordinate τ ∼ τ + 2π, and that the boundary

conditions respect this periodicity.

Now increase the period of the circle to τ ∼ τ +2πq where q ∈ Z, with the boundary

conditions respecting the original periodicity τ ∼ τ + 2π. Let Z(q) be the generating

functional for the solution with τ ∼ τ + 2πq. The generalised gravitational entropy is
defined by

where it is assumed that it is possible to continue Igrav

Specialising to static aAdS spacetime, let us assume there is a circle that wraps the
boundary ∂A of a subregion A of the aAdS boundary. In this case, increasing the period

by a factor q is effectively a holographic implementation of the replica trick, replacing

the original boundary of aAdS with q copies of itself sewn together along A. The

generating functional is therefore related to the reduced density matrix by Z(q) = tr ρ̂qA ,

and the generalised gravitational entropy (3.33) is equal to the entanglement entropy
SE of the subregion A in the dual QFT.

In order to evaluate (3.33), we require a prescription to perform the continuation

to non-integer q. A convenient one is as follows. For integer q, we demanded that
the boundary conditions were invariant under τ → τ + 2π, implying the existence of a

Zq replica symmetry under cyclic permutations of the q arcs of length 2π which make
up the τ circle. Assuming this replica symmetry is unbroken, we may therefore write
ln Z(q) = q[ln Z(q)]2π , where [·]2π indicates that τ is integrated only over the range
[0, 2π]. If we take this to be true also for non-integer q, then we may rewrite (3.33) as

(q)]. It was

shown in ref. [111] that (3.33) reduces to the area of a minimal surface which intersects
the aAdS boundary at ∂A. This amounts to a proof of the RT prescription, subject to
the validity of the continuation to non-integer q.
Generalised gravitational entropy was adapted to probe branes in ref. [119]. Since
the formula (3.33) depends only on the on-shell action, we expect that the leading nontrivial term in the probe limit may be calculated without computing the back-reaction
of the brane. Expanding in powers of the tension, we find
(1)

SE = lim q 2 ∂q [Ibrane (q)]2π
q→1

(3.35)

To compute (3.35) we need to know the gravitational solution at arbitrary q. For
35

a probe brane embedded in pure AdS with spherical entangling region, this solution is
provided by the map to hyperbolic slicing (3.24), Wick rotated to Euclidean signature
τ → iτ [119]. In Euclidean signature, the hyperbolic slicing covers the whole of local

AdS. The Euclidean τ is periodic, τ ∼ τ + 2π, with the τ circles winding the horizon
as illustrated in figure 3.5. To increase the period to β = 2πq, one changes the metric
function f (v) to that given in (3.28), with vH given by (3.29). The entanglement
entropy then becomes

SE = 2π lim ∂β [Ibrane

We will make use of this method in chapter 6. In several of the examples in that
chapter, we will only know the brane solution at β = 2π. We cannot then analytically

compute the on-shell action Ibrane
as a function of β. However, we may still calculate

the entanglement entropy using (3.36) by making use the observation of ref. [120] that
the first variation of the action with respect to the fields vanishes when the fields satisfy
the classical equations of motion, and therefore we may choose to take the embedding
on-shell only after performing the derivative in (3.36).

Since the action is on shell, the functional derivative with respect to X M vanishes

from the temperature dependence of the background metric, or more generally the full

more generally all world volume fields, throughout the calculation of the generalised
gravitational entropy (3.36).

Entanglement density
4.1

Introduction

The scaling of entanglement entropy with subregion size ` provides a diagnostic tool
for characterising the state of matter. For example, in d-dimensional spacetime, entanglement entropy receives contributions ∝ NG ln `d−2 from NG Goldstone bosons [121],

∝ `d−2 ln ` from a Fermi surface [122–125], or independent of ` from topologicallyordered degrees of freedom [126–129].

The goal of this chapter is to use gauge/gravity duality to study the dependence
of entanglement entropy on ` in holographic CFTs with a variety of deformations.1
We use holography since it provides a simple way to calculate entanglement entropy in
interacting QFTs, allowing us to study a wide range of deformations.

4.1.1

Definition of entanglement density

As discussed in chapter 3, entanglement entropy in QFT is generally UV divergent. In
order to obtain a finite quantity characterising our deformed CFTs, we will subtract
the entanglement entropy SECFT of the undeformed CFT. In order to highlight the
qualitative features of the subtracted entanglement entropy, we find it useful to divide
by the volume V of the entangling region, defining the entanglement density 2
σ≡

SE − SECFT
.
V

(4.1)

We could also have chosen to remove the UV divergences using covariant counterterms [132, 133]. Our subtraction is motivated by the definition of entanglement
temperature [134, 135]. Under a small change in the state of a QFT, the change in

The research in this chapter was conducted in collaboration with Nikola I. Gushterov (in addition
to my supervisor, Andy O’Bannon), and was also submitted as part of his PhD thesis at the University
of Oxford. My primary contributions were the calculation of the numerical results that are presented
in this chapter and the next, and the analytic calculations in appendix A.
2
A different quantity, also called entanglement density, was defined in refs. [130, 131] as a second
variation of the entanglement entropy with respect to the boundary of the entangling region.

39

the entanglement entropy of a spherical subregion, or a strip in a holographic QFT,
is proportional to the change in the energy contained in the entangling region [134,
135]. If the initial and final states are translationally invariant, the change in energy is
V δhTtt i, where δhTtt i is the small change in the expectation value of the stress tensor,
so the change in entanglement entropy is

δSE = TE−1 V δhTtt i,

(4.2)

where by definition the proportionality coefficient TE is the entanglement temperature. For a small perturbation in the state, the entanglement density (4.1) reduces to
TE−1 δhTtt i, but it is also well defined for large changes in the state, and for changes in
the Hamiltonian of the QFT.

Our goal is to characterise deformed CFTs using the dependence of the entanglement density on subregion size `. We will consider d-dimensional QFTs with d ≥ 3,

and use both the strip and sphere geometries for the subregions. In section 4.2 we
derive formulae for the holographic entanglement density in an asymptotically AdSd+1

metric of a general form that encompasses all but one of our later examples. In the
subsequent sections we numerically solve for the entanglement density as a function of
`.
For both the sphere and the strip, TE ∝ `−1 . Hence, we find that σ ∝ `hTtt i at

small ` for deformations of the state, such as non-zero temperature. For deformations
of the Hamiltonian, the small-` behaviour of the entanglement density is determined
by the dimension ∆ of the perturbing operator, as we discuss in section 4.3.
As ` → ∞ compared to all other scales, the leading behaviour of the subtracted

entanglement entropy is3

SE − SECFT = sV + αA + . . . ,

(4.3)

where s is the thermodynamic entropy density (which vanishes in some of our examples),
A is the surface area of the entangling region, α is a dimensionful constant, and the
ellipsis represents terms subleading in 1/`.
The leading volume term ∝ V in (4.3) is expected for mixed states, such as thermal

states. In such cases, when ` → ∞ the subregion becomes the entire system, and the

reduced density matrix ρ̂A becomes the total density matrix ρ̂. Hence the entanglement

entropy becomes equal to the thermodynamic entropy. In holography, this occurs

because the RT surface lies along a horizon at large ` [137, 138], so that after subtracting
UV divergences, the dominant contribution to its area comes from the area of the


horizon. For a sphere, V ∝ `d−1 while for the strip, V ∝ Vol Rd−2 `, where Vol Rd−2

Some deformations can also introduce a term ∝ A ln A in the subtracted entanglement entropy.
One example is a chemical potential µ in a free fermion CFT, which produces a Fermi surface [122–125]
resulting in a logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy as mentioned above. For discussions about
the conditions under which such “area law violation” can occur, see for example ref. [136].

is the regularised area of one of the planar boundaries of the strip.
For Lorentz-invariant RG flows to a d-dimensional CFT in the IR, α obeys a weak
monotonicity theorem, called the area theorem [41, 139], which implies that α ≤ 0.

The area theorem has been proven in d = 3 using strong subadditivity [41] and for a

sphere in d ≥ 3 using positivity of relative entropy [139].4 Roughly speaking, strong

subadditivity is holographically dual to the null energy condition [140, 141]. All of our
holographic examples will obey the null energy condition.5
As discussed in section 2.1.1, quantities satisfying monotonicity theorems typically
count degrees of freedom. It is thus natural to ask whether α counts degrees of freedom
in any precise sense. Further, one may wonder whether the monotonicity extends to
other types of deformations, such as finite temperature or chemical potential, or to
non-Lorentz invariant RG flows [143]. We will use entanglement density to study some
of these issues in holographic systems.
From (4.3), we find that when ` is much larger than all other scales, the entanglement density satisfies
σ =s+α

V

(4.4)

For both the sphere and strip A/V ∝ 1/`. In section 4.2 we use techniques from

refs. [138, 144, 145] to show that for a holographic QFT dual to a geometry with a
horizon, the entanglement density indeed takes the form (4.4) for both the sphere and
the strip, with the same coefficient α for both geometries.
Equation (4.4) shows that we can easily read off the sign of α from the large` behaviour of the entanglement density. In section 4.2 we find a formula for the
coefficient of the 1/` correction as an integral over bulk metric components, which
typically must be performed numerically, making it particularly easy to extract the
sign of α.

Strong subadditivity is the inequality SE [A] + SE [B] ≥ SE [A ∪ B] + SE [A ∩ B], for subspaces A and
B. The relative entropy between two density matrices ρ1 and ρ2 is S(ρ1 |ρ2 ) = tr(ρ1 ln ρ1 − ρ1 ln ρ0 ).
Positivity of relative entropy is S(ρ1 |ρ2 ) ≥ 0.

(4.7)

The exceptions to the behaviour (4.6) are the holographic RG flows studied in
sections 4.3 and 4.6. Each RG flow will be triggered by a non-zero source or vacuum
expectation value (VEV) of a relevant operator, and there may be smaller powers of z
appearing in the near boundary expansions (4.6), depending on the dimension of the
operator.
In some of our examples there is a horizon at z = zH > 0, such that f (zH ) = 0.
As discussed in 2.5.1, the temperature T and thermodynamic entropy density s are
determined by the horizon’s Hawking temperature and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,
respectively. In the coordinate system (4.5), one finds

In the next two subsections we derive formulae for the entanglement density in the
sphere and strip geometries, for the holographic duals of spacetimes of the form (4.5),
using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription. The results will be integrals over the metric
function g(z). The details of the different theories giving rise to our different examples
will enter into the entanglement density through the form of this function.

4.2.1

Strip geometry

Recall that in the strip geometry the entangling region is enclosed by parallel planes
at x1 = ±`/2. To reduce notation we will drop the superscript on x1 from now on.

Using the translational and rotational symmetry of the strip we can parameterise the

minimal surface as x(z). As depicted in figure 3.2, the minimal surface will have some
maximal extension into the bulk at some z = z∗ . By symmetry, x(z∗ ) = 0, since the

strip is invariant under x → −x. The area functional is then

where  is a short-distance cutoff. The factor of Vol(Rd−2 ) arises from the integrals

the entanglement density.
Since the area (4.9) depends only on x0 (z), there is a conserved quantity, the value

result (3.11) and divide by the volume of the strip, V = ` Vol(Rd−2 ). To avoid numerical
imprecision caused by the subtraction of two UV-divergent quantities, we rewrite the

and ds2Sd−2 is the metric of a round, unit-radius (d − 2)-sphere. We use rotational

integrand is cumbersome, so we do not reproduce it here.

4.2.3

Asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement density

Small subregions
In this section we derive results for the behaviour of the entanglement density for
subregion size ` small compared to all other scales in theory apart from the UV cutoff.
We follow the method of ref. [134].
Suppose the metric function g(z) takes the form
g(z) ≈ 1 + az b + . . .

(4.17)

at small z, where b > 0 and the ellipsis denotes terms with larger powers of z. When
the entangling region is small, the RT surface will remain close to the boundary rather
than probing deep into the bulk, as depicted in figure 4.1. Therefore, in this subsection
we assume that az∗b  1 for sufficiently small `, where z∗ is the maximal extension of

the RT surface into the bulk.

with the subregion size in the presence of a planar horizon. The grey region is the bulk
of AdS, with the boundary and the horizon represented by the black lines at the top and
bottom, respectively. The red curves are typical shapes of the RT surface for different
subregion sizes. For small subregions, the RT surface does not probe deep into the
bulk, and so is insensitive to the presence of the horizon. For large subregions, part of
the RT surface almost lies flat along the horizon. The dashed blue line is a surface that
drops straight from the boundary to the horizon. In our examples, we find that such a
surface is an extremum, but not a global minimum of the area functional.

In principle, one could find the analogous asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement

Large subregions
For large subregions, in the presence of a planar horizon in the bulk of aAdS, the
RT surface will typically have a component that almost lies flat along the horizon, as
illustrated in figure 4.1. This provides the dominant contribution to the entanglement
density as ` → ∞, so in this limit the entanglement density tends to the thermodynamic
entropy density s, determined from (2.29).

The result for the sphere, (4.25b), is derived in appendix A.1 using the method of
matched expansions developed in ref. [138]. The proof of (4.25a) was carried out by
my collaborator, Nikola I. Gushterov, and is detailed in ref. [1].
We may bring (4.25) into a unified form by noting that the ratio of the surface area
A to volume V of the entangling region is A/V = 2/` for the strip and A/V = (d − 1)/`
for the sphere. We may therefore rewrite (4.25) as

which is valid for both the strip and the sphere. The first correction to the extensive
behaviour σ ≈ s at large ` is proportional to the surface area of the entangling region,
with coefficient determined by (4.26).

Comparing to (4.4), we see that the area law coefficient is given by α = szH C(zH ).
Since s and zH are non-negative, the area theorem would imply that C(zH ) ≤ 0.

However, the area theorem only applies to Lorentz-invariant RG flows, and therefore
does not apply to the holographic duals of geometries with horizons. Indeed, in many
of our examples we find that C(zH ) > 0. We will refer to this as area theorem violation,
although strictly speaking the area theorem does not apply to these examples.

where R is the Ricci scalar and φ is a real scalar field with potential V (φ). We want
solutions to the equations of motion derived from Sgrav that describe Lorentz-invariant
RG flows between CFTs, driven by the scalar operator O holographically dual to φ.
We thus assume V (φ) has at least two stationary points, at which the equations of

motion are solved by pure AdSd+1 , with radius of curvature L given by
8πGN V (φ)|stationary = −

d(d − 1)

2L2

(4.29)

where we assume the potential is negative at the stationary points. In RG flow solutions
φ interpolates between two stationary points, beginning from a maximum of V (φ) in
the UV (z = 0), and tending to a minimum in the IR (z → ∞). The metric interpolates

from AdS with radius L, to AdS with radius LIR . Since the potential is less negative in
the UV than in the IR, we find from (4.29) that L > LIR . This inequality is guaranteed
by the holographic c-theorem [148].
To find RG flow solutions, we make an ansatz

We therefore only need to solve the first-order equation (4.32). In fact, for our purposes,
we can construct bottom-up holographic models of RG flows by choosing g(z), which
then determines W and hence φ(z) via (4.32), which in turn is guaranteed to solve the
equations of motion for the corresponding potential V (φ) in (4.31).
The metric function g(z) obeys several constraints which will restrict our choice.
Equation (4.32) implies
φ0 (z)2 =

d − 1 g 0 (z)
,
16πGN zg(z)

(4.33)

so that g 0 (z) ≥ 0, since φ(z) is real and by assumption g(z) > 0. The null energy
condition also requires g 0 (z) ≥ 0, so any solution of (4.32) is guaranteed to obey the
null energy condition. We require that O is relevant, so its scaling dimension is ∆ < d,
and unitary, so ∆ ≥

d−2
2 .

We will actually impose a stricter upper bound, ∆ ≤

(d + 2)/2. Larger values of ∆ introduce additional UV divergences in the entanglement
entropy, which the subtraction SE − SECFT does not cancel [138, 139]. As discussed in
section 2.5, the asymptotic behaviour of the scalar field is then φ(z) = φ(0) z ∆− + . . .,
where ∆− = Min(d − ∆, ∆). The coefficient φ(0) is proportional either to the source of
O (∆− = d − ∆) or to the VEV hOi (∆− = ∆). The range of allowed ∆− values is

Figure 4.2 shows our numerical results for σ as a function of `, for each of the flows
determined by (4.37). We plot σ in units of µ3 L3 /GN , where L3 /GN is proportional
the Weyl anomaly of the UV CFT [64, 65]. In all cases, σ < 0 for all µ`, with σ → 0−

as µ` → ∞, as required by the area theorem.

Figure 4.2a shows the simplest behaviour, for the g(z) in (4.37a), in which σ ∝ −`

at small `, and then a single minimum appears before σ → 0− as µ` → ∞, for both

the strip and sphere. Figure 4.2b, for the g(z) in (4.37b), is similar, but with a second,
local minimum, and an intermediate local maximum, at intermediate `, for the strip.
The sphere exhibits only a single local minimum.
For the g(z) in (4.37c), three extremal surfaces exist for the strip over the range
0.51 . µ` . 0.69. Figure 4.3 shows the difference in area, ∆A, between each of these
three surfaces and the minimal surface in AdS5 with the same `, indicating a transition
from one to the other as the global minimum of the area functional. We find that this
transition occurs at µ` ≈ 0.65. The entanglement density for the strip therefore exhibits

a kink at the critical `, shown in figures 4.2c and 4.2d. In contrast, no transition occurs

holographic CFTs in d = 4. In each plot, the solid blue line is for the strip and the
dashed red line is for the sphere. The caption to each plot indicates the g(z) we chose
from (4.37). For the g(z) in (4.37c), there are three extremal surfaces for the strip
geometry (see figure 4.3). The strip entanglement entropy undergoes a “first-order
phase transition” at µ` ≈ 0.65, where the surface of minimal area changes. This leads
to the kink in the entanglement density shown in (c) and (d), where the solid blue and
dot-dashed black curves meet.

for the sphere, and σ for the sphere does not exhibit a kink.
The g(z) in (4.37d) yields ∆− = 3/2, so (4.36) implies σ tends to a negative constant

at ` = 0. As ` increases, σ monotonically increases to zero as shown in figure 4.2e. The
g(z) in (4.37e) yields ∆− = 7/4, hence (4.36) implies σ ∝ −`1/2 at small `. Aside from

the fractional power of `, the entanglement density for this g(z) behaves similar to that
for the g(z) in (4.37a), with a single global minimum before σ → 0− as µ` → ∞.
In summary, the entanglement density can exhibit a variety of behaviour as a func-

tion of `, depending on details of the RG flow. However, σ often exhibits a unique
global minimum, which by dimensional analysis must be at an ` ∝ 1/µ. This value of
` provides a candidate quantity to characterize and compare RG flows. For example,
it may provide a precise definition of the crossover scale from the UV to IR.

Figure 4.4: The dimensionless coefficient C(zH ) for AdSd+1 -Schwarzschild. The sign of
C(zH ) controls whether σ → s from above or below at large `, see (4.25). The black
dots show the value of C(zH ) for integer d, while the grey curve is an interpolation
obtained by letting d take non-integer values in (4.26). At d = 3, C(zH ) ≈ −0.88, and
C(zH ) then increases monotonically with d, reaching zero at dcrit ≈ 6.7, indicated by
the vertical line.
There is a horizon at zH = m−1/d , with hTtt i, T , and s given by equations (4.7)

and (4.8). The numerical results for the entanglement entropy of a strip in AdSSchwarzschild presented in this section have been reproduced analytically in ref. [152].
The entanglement density for T `  1 is given by the first law of entanglement

entropy [134], (4.22) and (4.23) for the strip and the sphere, respectively. Note that
in particular σ ∝ ` with a positive proportionality coefficient, in contrast to the en-

tanglement density for RG flows. As T ` → ∞, the entanglement density tends to the
thermodynamic entropy density s, according to (4.27). Whether this occurs from above
or below depends on the sign of the coefficient C(zH ), given in (4.26). Figure 4.4 shows
the value of C(zH ) as a function of d. We find that σ → s from below (σ → s− ) for

d ≤ 6, while σ → s from above (σ → s+ ) for d ≥ 7, signalling area theorem violation.7

For example, figures 4.5a and 4.5b show our numerical results for σ/s as a function

of T ` for AdSd+1 -Schwarzschild in d = 4 and 8. In all cases we find σ/s ∝ ` at

small T `, as expected. For d = 4 and for both the strip and sphere, we find σ/s
increases monotonically and σ → s− as T ` → ∞, whereas for d = 8, σ/s rises to

a global maximum at an ` that by dimensional analysis must be ∝ 1/T , and then
σ → s+ as T ` → ∞. The dotted lines in figures 4.5a and 4.5b show the large-`

approximation (4.25). Figures 4.5c and 4.5d show the entanglement density for all
values of d between three and eight. When d ≤ 6 we find that the entanglement density
increases monotonically with `, while for d ≥ 7 the entanglement density exhibits a

global maximum at intermediate values of `.

This pattern extends to CFTs at non-zero T in d = 2, where the entanglement
entropy for an interval of length ` is known exactly [106]. Given d = 2 < dcrit , we
7

In appendix A.2 we show that C(zH ) for AdS-Schwarzschild monotonically increases with d, and
therefore remains positive for all values of d larger than those shown in figure 4.4.

The first term in the expansion is the thermodynamic entropy density s [32]. The second

In the d → ∞ limit AdS-Schwarzschild is dual to an RG flow from a (d + 1)-

dimensional UV CFT to a (0 + 1)-dimensional scale-invariant theory in the IR, which is
clearly only possible when Lorentz symmetry is broken. In the limit d → ∞, the nearhorizon geometry of the AdS-Schwarzschild black brane becomes SL(2, R)/U (1)×Rd−1 ,
with Rd−1 corresponding to the QFT spatial directions ~x [153, 154]. The SL(2, R) factor
implies that linearized fluctuations in the near-horizon region exhibit scale invariance
in t and z but not ~x [154, 155]. This suggests that area-theorem violation may be
associated to an IR fixed point with different scaling to the UV. We find area theorem
violation in some, but not all, of our other examples with different scaling in the IR.

AdS-Reissner-Nordström is AdS2 × Rd−2 , with AdS2 of radius L/ d(d − 1) [157]. The

holographic dual of extremal AdS-Reissner-Nordström is known as a semi-local quantum liquid state [158], describing an RG flow from a d-dimensional UV CFT to a
(0 + 1)-dimensional scale invariant theory in the IR.
Since g(z) for AdS-Reissner-Nordström takes the form (4.6), the small-` entanglement density is linear in ` for both the strip and sphere geometries. As ` → ∞
the entanglement density tends to the thermodynamic entropy density, with sublead-

ing behaviour given by (4.25). The coefficient C(zH ) which determines whether the
σ → s from above or below is plotted as a function of T /µ in figure 4.6. We find that

C(zH ) is positive for T /µ = 0, for all d. For large T /µ, C(zH ) tends to the value for
AdS-Schwarzschild, so is negative for d ≤ 6 and positive for d ≥ 7.

at (T /µ)1 a local minimum and maximum appear in σ/s as a function of T `; at (T /µ)2
the local maximum becomes a global maximum, but a local minimum remains, and
σ/s < 1 for all T `; and then at (T /µ)3 the global maximum rises above one, and the
transition occurs to σ/s → 1+ as T ` → ∞.
values of T /µ.9 We find σ/s ∝ T ` at small ` for all T /µ, as expected. For large T /µ,
the entanglement density reproduces that of AdSd+1 -Schwarzschild; in particular it is

monotonic in T ` for d = 4, and exhibits a global maximum for d = 8. As T /µ is
lowered, a global maximum appears also for d = 4, consistent with C(zH ) as plotted in
figure 4.6. The sphere shows the same qualitative behaviour.
As plotted in figure 4.7c, for the strip in d = 4 the transition between σ/s → 1± at

large ` occurs in three stages. At high temperature, σ monotonically approaches s from

below. As we lower the temperature, at T /µ ≈ 0.107 a local minimum and maximum
appear, with σ/s < 1 for all T `. Then, at T /µ ≈ 0.102, the maximum rises above

σ/s = 1, becoming a global maximum, but a local minimum persists at σ/s < 1, and
then σ/s → 1− as T ` → ∞. Finally, at T /µ ≈ 0.098, a transition occurs from σ/s → 1−

to σ/s → 1+ as T ` → ∞, and the local minimum disappears. Figure 4.7d shows the
logarithmic derivative

` ∂σ
s ∂` ,

which clearly has no zero for T /µ > 0.107, indicating σ/s

is monotonic in T `, then develops two zeroes for 0.107 > T /µ > 0.102, indicating a
local minimum and maximum in σ/s, and then develops a single zero for T /µ < 0.098,
indicating a global maximum in σ/s. For the sphere, on the other hand, to within our
numerical precision we find no value of T /µ for which σ exhibits a local maximum with
σ/s < 1, as shown in figures 4.7e and 4.7f.
We find qualitatively similar behaviour for the strip in all d ≤ 6: at some (T /µ)1 a

local minimum and maximum appear, but σ/s remains below one for all T `; at some
(T /µ)2 < (T /µ)1 a global maximum emerges, but still σ/s → 1− for T ` → ∞ (in

other words C(zH ) < 0); and finally at some (T /µ)3 < (T /µ)2 the transition occurs
to σ/s → 1+ as T ` → ∞ (so that C(zH ) > 0). Our numerical estimates of (T /µ)1 ,
(T /µ)2 , and (T /µ)3 are listed in table 4.5. For d ≥ 7 the global maximum with σ/s > 1

exists for all T /µ.

In all cases above, the transition between σ/s → 1± as T ` → ∞ indicates area

theorem violation. Since C(zH ) > 0 at sufficiently small T /µ for all d, the area theorem

The results for the strip in AdS-Reissner-Nordström with d = 4 (figures 4.7a and 4.7c) were
submitted in partial fulfillment of my MPhys degree at the University of Oxford. The same is true of
the results for the strip and the sphere in extremal AdS-Reissner-Nordström with d = 4 (the orange

cases σ/s indeed has a global maximum and σ/s → 1+ as µ` → ∞.

In summary, in AdS-Reissner-Nordström for either d ≥ 7 at any T /µ, or for any d

and sufficiently small T /µ, we find a global maximum in σ/s, and σ/s → 1+ as ` → ∞,

indicating area theorem violation. In other words, as we dial a parameter towards a
limiting value in which an IR fixed point appears with different scaling from the UV
CFT (d → ∞ or T /µ → 0), we find area theorem violation.

of the gauge fields ÃM → η ÃM , the equations of motion may be simplified by separating

terms by powers of η, and solved by freely choosing two functions in the solution, which
then determine all other functions and the corresponding potentials V (Φ), Z(Φ), and
Z̃(Φ), leaving only a choice of boundary conditions. Following ref. [159], we choose
b2 (z) and Fzt (z), and obtain a(z) by solving, from the equations of motion,

and Q is the charge density dual to AM , Q ≡ −δSgrav /δFzt .
Specifying b2 (z) and Fzt (z) and solving (4.48) and (4.49) with the above boundary
conditions completely determines the metric, and therefore the holographic entanglement entropy. There are further equations which fix the remaining fields and potentials,
for a detailed discussion of which we refer to ref. [159]. These additional equations imply that F̃tz (z) and Φ(z) are generically non-zero, indicating that the dual theory has
non-zero chemical potential and charge density for the second U(1), and also hOi =
6 0
and possibly a non-zero source for O. For the family of solutions under consideration,
all of these quantities are determined by T /µ.

We will solve (4.48) and (4.49) numerically. We focus on the three solutions presented in ref. [159], which at T = 0 have no horizon, and describe domain walls from
aAdSd+1 as z → 0 to a hyperscaling-violating geometry as z → ∞. We impose boundary conditions

a(z = 0) = b0 (z = 0) = 1,

(4.51)

and at leading order b2 (z) ∝ −z d . If we choose
ĉ = d − 2 +

(d − 1)(ζ − 1) − θ
,
d−1−θ

(4.52)

then when z → ∞ we find the following scalings
a(z) ∼ z −[(d−1)(ζ−1)−θ]/(d−θ−1) ,
The solutions we study all have Φ ∝

b0 (z) ∼ z −[(d−1)(ζ−1)+θ]/(d−θ−1) ,
z d−2

b2 (z) ∼ −z d .

at small z, so ∆− = d − 2 in the notation of

section 4.3. From (4.36) we therefore find σ ∝ `d−3 at small `.

When η 6= 0 there is instead a horizon at some z = zH . The entanglement density at

T `  1 is given by (4.25). When ζ → ∞ with −θ/ζ fixed, the metric (4.54) becomes
conformal to AdS2 × Rd−1 , with no horizon [160].

Under a Lifshitz scaling, t → λζ t, ~x → λ~x, z → λ(d−θ−1)/(d−1) z, the metric (4.54)
60

rescales as ds2 → λ2θ/(d−1) ds2 . For pure AdS, the holographic dual to a CFT, θ = 0

and ζ = 1. When θ = 0 but ζ 6= 1, the holographic dual is referred to as a Lifshitz

theory. Non-zero θ indicates hyperscaling violation for θ 6= 0 [161, 162]. Hyperscaling
refers to the naive scaling of the free energy according to its mass dimension, F → λ−ζ F

under the Lifshitz scaling t → λζ t and ~x → λ~x. With hyperscaling violation, the free

energy instead scales as F → λθ−ζ F.

Hyperscaling violation is rare in non-holographic models, although Fermi liquids

have θ = d − 2 [163]. Strange metals — such as cuprate high-temperature superconductors — have an optical conductivity with unusual high-temperature frequency

dependence, which suggests that hyperscaling is violated in these materials [164, 165].
Hyperscaling-violating holographic models with θ = d−2 are believed to possess hidden
Fermi surfaces, corresponding to fermions in non-trivial representations of the gauge
group [161]. Hidden Fermi surfaces are difficult to probe directly in gauge/gravity
duality, which relates only gauge-invariant observables in the two theories. However,
entanglement entropy in other holographic models with θ = d − 2 exhibits logarithmic

violation of the area law, characteristic of a Fermi surface [161, 166]. We find that the
same is true in the model of ref. [159].

In this section we only compute the entanglement density for the strip geometry.
Since we solve for a(z) and b0 (z) numerically, it is computationally intensive obtaining
satisfactory numerical precision when solving for the RT surface in the sphere geometry
and evaluating its area. The strip is simpler since we do not need to solve for the
embedding of the RT surface. As discussed in section 4.2.3, the large-` behaviour of
the entanglement density is the same for the strip and the sphere, so it is enough to
compute the entanglement density for the strip to determine whether the area theorem
is violated.
We will now show results for the entanglement entropy for the three choices of b2
and Fzt given in ref. [159]. We first consider a d = 3 solution specified by
b2 = −ẑ 3

9ẑ 2 + 20ẑ + 80
,
9ẑ 2 + 20ẑ + 40

F̂zt = − (1 + 0.891 ẑ)−4 .

(4.55)

At T = 0 this is a domain wall from AdS4 to a hyperscaling-violating geometry with
ζ = 2 and θ = −2.

Figures 4.9a and 4.9b show the entanglement density versus T ` for the strip in this

solution for several non-zero values of T /µ. For all T /µ, we find that σ/s tends to a
negative constant value as ` → 0. At large T /µ, the entanglement density tends to that

of AdS4 -Schwarzschild, which is monotonic in T `. Lowering T /µ, when T /µ ≈ 0.130 a

local maximum and minimum appear at intermediate T `. As T /µ is decreased further,
the maximum grows in height, and the minimum increases in depth. Figure 4.9c shows
the entanglement density at T = 0. We find that the entanglement density tends to
the entropy density from below as ` → ∞ for all T /µ; figure 4.9d shows C(zH ), which

is negative for all T /µ.

corresponding to equation (4.55) (d = 3, ζ = 2, θ = −2). Figures (a) and (b) show the
entanglement density at non-zero temperature (the distinction between high and low
temperature is an arbitrary choice made for clarity of presentation). A local maximum
and minimum appear when T /µ . 0.130. Figure (c) is the entanglement density for
T = 0, corresponding to a domain wall between a CFT in the UV and a hyperscalingviolating IR. (d): The coefficient C(zH ), the sign of which controls whether σ → s from

This example shows that an IR fixed point with non-relativistic scaling does not
require violation of the area theorem. If there is indeed a connection between the area
theorem and scaling in the IR, then the connection only goes one way. In other words,
it is possible that area theorem violation implies non-relativistic scaling in the IR, but
the reverse statement is not true.

Figures 4.10a and 4.10b show the entanglement density as a function of T ` for the

strip in this solution, for several values of T /µ. For all T /µ, we find σ/s ∝ ` at small

T `. At sufficiently large T /µ, σ/s increases monotonically with T `, so in particular
σ/s → 1− as T ` → ∞. As we decrease T /µ we find a transition very similar to that

of AdS-Reissner-Nordström with d ≤ 6, discussed in section 4.5. At some (T /µ)1 , a

local minimum and maximum appear, with σ/s remaining below one for all T `. Then,
at some (T /µ)2 , the local maximum rises above one to become a global maximum, but

still σ/s → 1− for T ` → ∞. Finally, at some (T /µ)3 , the local minimum disappears
and σ/s → 1+ as T ` → ∞. Our numerical results for (T /µ)1 , (T /µ)2 , and (T /µ)3 are
listed in table 4.3.

Figure 4.10c shows our numerical results for the entanglement density at T /µ = 0.
As mentioned above, for a solution such as this, with ζ → ∞, when T /µ = 0 the

z → ∞ geometry is conformal to AdS2 ×Rd−2 , with no horizon. As for other geometries
conformal to AdS2 × Rd−2 , there are two different extremal surfaces [167, 168]. One is
a smooth, connected surface, with area given by (4.11). The other is a disconnected
surface, consisting of two sheets at x(z) = ±`/2. The connected surface only exists for

µ` . 2.37. When it exists, it always has smaller area than the disconnected surface,
and therefore determines the entanglement entropy (the blue curve in figure 4.10c). For
µ` & 2.37, the entanglement entropy is determined by the disconnected surface (the
dashed black curve in figure 4.10c).
Figure 4.10d shows C(zH ) versus T /µ. As expected from our results for the entanglement density, for T /µ < (T /µ)3 we find C(zH ) < 0.

At T = 0, the solution is a domain wall from AdS4 to a hyperscaling-violating geometry
with ζ = 3 and θ = 1.
Figures 4.11a and 4.11b show our results for the entanglement density in this solution with T /µ > 0. At high temperature we find that σ/s → 1− monotonically.
Lowering T /µ, we find similar behaviour to the previous solution, with a local mini63

finally σ/s → 1− for T /µ ≤ (T /µ)3 , indicating area theorem violation at low tempera-

tures. The values of these critical values of (T /µ) are listed in table 4.3. Figure 4.11c
shows the entanglement density as a function of µ` at T /µ = 0. We find σ → 0+ as
µ` → ∞, indicating that the area theorem violation persists at zero temperature.

At T /µ = 0, the IR hyperscaling violation exponent is θ = d−2. We therefore expect

the dual QFT to contain a hidden Fermi surface, which should produce a logarithmic
term in the entanglement density at large `. To see the origin of the logarithm, we
rewrite the entanglement density for the strip as [1]

T /µ = 0, as z → ∞ one finds g(z) = b(z)/a(z) ∼ z −2θ/(d−θ−1) for general d, ζ, and θ.

Substituting this into C(z∗ ), with θ = (d − 2) we find an integral dz/z at large z∗ ,

AdS soliton

In this section we study the AdS soliton solution to the Einstein-Hilbert bulk action (4.38) [80, 170–172], obtained from AdS-Schwarzschild by double Wick rotation.

the dual field theory has a mass gap and confinement [80, 171]. The AdS soliton has
T = 0, s = 0, and a negative Casimir energy

16πGN z0d

(4.61)

Since the AdS soliton metric (4.60) is not of the form (4.5), the results of section 4.2
do not apply. However, the minimal area calculations generalise straightforwardly [171,
173]. As our entangling region, we take a strip of width `, with planar boundaries
separated along a non-compact direction x. The entangling region therefore wraps
66

around χ. We do not consider the sphere geometry, since compactifying one of the
spatial directions breaks rotational symmetry, rendering the sphere more complicated
to study than in the previous sections.
As shown in ref. [171], multiple extremal surfaces exist. For any `, there are disconnected extremal surfaces with x0 (z) = 0. The disconnected surfaces drop straight
from the boundary of AdS to the hard wall, analogous to the dashed blue surface in
figure 4.1, but with the horizon replaced by a hard wall. The area of a disconnected
surface is

Connected surfaces exist only for values of ` that can be obtained from (4.63) with
positive z∗ . Numerically, one finds that connected surfaces exist in d = 4 for ` . 0.7z0 .

We plot ` as a function of z0 for d = 4 in figure 4.12a. For a given ` . 0.7z0 , there are
two solutions for z∗ , and therefore two connected extremal surfaces [171].

To define the entanglement density in AdS soliton, we take a slightly different

background subtraction to our previous examples, since the compact spatial direction
of AdS soliton changes the UV divergence of the holographic entanglement entropy
compared to AdSd+1 . The factor of Vol(Rd−2 ) in the AdSd+1 strip entanglement entropy (3.12) arises from the area of the planar boundaries of the strip. Since the strip
we consider wraps the compact spatial direction χ, the planar boundaries instead have
area (4πz0 /d) × Vol(Rd−3 ), changing the coefficient of the UV divergent −(d−2) term

in the entanglement entropy. For a detailed discussion of the divergence of SE in the
AdS soliton and regularisation schemes, see ref. [173].
We will instead remove the UV divergence by subtracting the strip entanglement
entropy in AdSd+1 with a compact direction of length 4πz0 /d, which we will refer to
as compactified AdSd+1 . The compactified AdSd+1 metric is locally identical to (2.11),
but produces divergences in the holographic entanglement entropy identical to those in

other values of d.

the AdS soliton.
A key caveat is that compactified AdSd+1 has a conical singularity at z = ∞ [174].

The singularity could affect the behaviour of the entanglement density as ` → ∞,

since in this limit the RT surface probes deep into the bulk. We have compared our
subtraction to renormalisation via covariant counterterms [132, 133], and found no
difference at large `. The counterterms for the strip only remove the divergent term
proportional to −(d−2) , and so the renormalised entanglement entropy differs from
the result of our subtraction only by a term ∝ 1/`d−2 , which primarily affects the

behaviour at small `. In particular, this means that our subtraction is sufficient to
determine whether the area theorem is violated.
Figure 4.12b shows the subtracted areas of each of the extremal surfaces as functions
68

of ` for d = 4, with the solid blue lines and dashed orange lines representing the
two connected surfaces, and the dot-dashed black line representing the disconnected
surface. The blue connected surface area has smallest area for ` . 0.615z0 , while the
disconnected surface has smallest area for ` & 0.615z0 [173]. There is therefore a “phase
transition” in the entanglement entropy at ` = 0.615z0 .
Applying our subtraction to the area of the connected surfaces (4.64) gives a formula
for the entanglement density for ` below the transition,

Since the AdS soliton solution is not Lorentz-invariant, the proofs of the area theo69

ficient of the entanglement entropy area term as counting degrees of freedom; the hard
wall of the AdS soliton geometry implies that there are no degrees of freedom in the
deep IR of the dual QFT. It would be interesting to determine whether the area theorem is satisfied in other holographic systems with a mass gap, to test the interpretation
of the area term as counting degrees of freedom.

4.8

Discussion

We have computed the entanglement density of holographic CFTs with a variety of
deformations, paying particular attention to its behaviour for large subregions. For
Lorentz invariant RG flows, the coefficient α of the area contribution to entanglement
entropy satisfies a monotonicity theorem [41, 139] which ensures α ≤ 0, suggesting that
the area term in entanglement entropy may count degrees of freedom.

In section 4.3, we found α < 0 in holographic examples of Lorentz invariant RG
flows, as required by the area theorem. We also found α < 0 for the AdS soliton
solution in section 4.7, despite the fact that the proof of the area theorem does not
hold for this system. The AdS soliton is dual to a QFT with a mass gap, so α < 0 is
consistent with the idea that α counts degrees of freedom.
However, in sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 we found many examples with α > 0. These
examples all had non-zero temperature or chemical potential, or both, and included examples of RG flows from a Lorentz-invariant UV to a hyperscaling-violating IR. Such
area theorem violation occurred at or near regimes where the IR exhibited different
scaling to the UV. Area theorem violation has also been observed at low temperatures in holographic systems with broken translational invariance [1], in which the dual
geometry had a near-horizon AdS2 factor at zero temperature, similar to AdS-ReissnerNordström. This suggests that the large-subregion behaviour of the entanglement entropy may be a probe of new scaling in the IR. However, one of the examples of RG
flows to a hyperscaling-violating IR (with d = 3, ζ = 2, and θ = −2) did not exhibit

area theorem violation. Hence, it cannot always be true that different scaling in the IR
implies area theorem violation.
There are a number of avenues for future research. For example, it would be interesting to study more examples of Lorentz-invariant to hyperscaling-violating RG
flows, with different values of (d, θ, ζ). One could then look for correlation between
the values of these parameters and area theorem violation. In addition, computing the
entanglement entropy for different examples of RG flows to an IR with a given (d, θ, ζ)
would provide a test of whether area theorem violation is determined only by these
parameters, or is model-dependent. As a final example, it would be useful to look for
area theorem violation in non-holographic models. This would provide a crucial test of
whether the results presented in this chapter may be applied to real physical systems.

Introduction and background

5.1.1

Hydrodynamics and sound waves

Hydrodynamics is an effective theory, describing the long-wavelength excitations of systems near thermal equilibrium. Here, “long-wavelength” means in comparison to the
mean free path of the quasiparticles in the system. The degrees of freedom in hydrodynamics are the conserved currents. A key assumption of hydrodynamics is that these
conserved currents are functions only of a small set of hydrodynamic variables: a local
temperature, a local fluid four-velocity, and local chemical potentials for any internal
global symmetries. Since hydrodynamics deals with long-wavelength phenomena, one
writes the components of the conserved currents as a series of terms with increasing
number of derivatives of the hydrodynamic variables.2
Substituting this expansion into the conservation equations, one can derive plane
wave solutions describing long-wavelength fluctuations around thermal equilibrium. For
example, conservation of the stress tensor in a translationally invariant system implies
the existence of sound waves, with dispersion
ω = ±vs k − iΓs k 2 + O(k 3 /T 3 ),

(5.1)

where ω is the angular frequency of the sound wave, k = |k| is the momentum (i.e. the

wavenumber), and T is temperature. The speed vs and attenuation constant Γs are
given by

cosities of the fluid, respectively. The sound modes appear as poles in the longitudinal3
retarded Green’s functions of the stress tensor.
If the system possesses a U(1) global symmetry, there will also be a hydrodynamic
mode corresponding to diffusion of the associated conserved charge, with dispersion
relation
ω = −iDk 2 + O(k 3 /T 3 ),

(5.3)

for some diffusion constant D. The charge diffusion mode is a pole in the longitudinal4
retarded Green’s functions of the conserved current associated to the U(1) symmetry.

5.1.2

Fermi liquids and zero sound

In this section we provide a brief review of elements of Fermi liquids, in particular the
phenomenon of zero sound. Zero sound was predicted in ref. [177] and observed in
ref. [178]. Our discussion will follow that of ref. [179].
A quantum liquid is an interacting fluid in which quantum properties, such as the
Pauli exclusion principle, play an important role. A Fermi liquid is a quantum liquid
of fermionic quasiparticles. Quantum effects typically become important when the
thermal de Broglie wavelength is of the order of the average distance between particles,
requiring low temperatures or large densities. Most materials freeze into solids at
temperatures larger than this, so fermi liquids are relatively rare in nature. In fact, the
only known example of a true Fermi liquid is helium-3.5 However, in many metals the
electron sea is well approximated as a fermi liquid [179].
The ground state of a gas of free fermions possesses a Fermi surface. For a fixed
number of particles, the low-energy excited states are reached by promoting a particle
from just inside the Fermi surface to just outside. The ground state of a Fermi liquid
also possesses a Fermi surface. However, promoting a particle out of the Fermi surface
no longer produces an energy eigenstate, due to the interactions between particles. A
key assumption of the theory of Fermi liquids is that the low-lying excited states can
instead be described by quasiparticles of well-defined momentum, particles dressed by
their interactions.
The distribution function, which gives the number of quasiparticles per unit momentum at a given position and time, obeys the Boltzmann equation. At low temperatures,
the frequency of hard collisions between quasiparticles becomes small. The term in the
Boltzmann equation which accounts for these collisions may then be neglected, in which

Quantum effects become important in helium-3 at temperatures of around 4 K [179]. At still colder
temperatures of around 3 mK, helium-3 undergoes a transition to a superfluid phase [180, 181], which
is not a fermi liquid.

taken to define the collisionless-to-hydrodynamic crossover.

case one can derive plane wave solutions with dispersion [177]6
ω = ±vk − iΓk 2 + O(k 3 /ε3F ),

(5.4)

where ω is the angular frequency of the wave, k is the absolute value of the momentum,
and εF is the Fermi energy. The speed v and attenuation constant Γ depend on the
form of the interactions between quasiparticles. The dispersion relation (5.4) is of the
same form as the dispersion of sound waves (5.1), although with different speed v and
attenuation Γ. This excitation is called zero sound, and arises from fluctuations in the
shape of the Fermi surface. Experimental observation of zero sound in helium-3 was
reported in ref. [178].
At zero temperature, the attenuation Γ takes a non-zero value due to decay into
quasiparticle-quasihole pairs (known as multipair decay) [179]. As the T is raised, the
attenuation passes through several regimes [177, 179, 182], as sketched in figure 5.1.
First, for T small compared to ω, collisions between quasiparticles are infrequent, and
the attenuation remains dominated by the multipair decay. As a result, Γ is approximately independent of temperature. This is known as the quantum collisionless regime.
When T becomes large compared to ω, collisions between thermally excited quasiparticles become frequent enough to provide the dominant contribution to zero sound
attenuation. The attenuation is proportional to the collision rate, Γ ∝ T 2 . This regime
is known as the thermal collisionless regime.
6

In the Fermi liquid literature, the dispersion of zero sound is usually given as k(ω), with real ω
and complex k. This may be straightforwardly obtained by inverting the expansion in (5.4), yielding
k = ±ω/v − iΓω 2 /v 2 + O(ω 3 /ε3F ).

73

As the temperature is raised further, the approximations used in the Landau Fermi
liquid theory break down. However, the collisions become frequent enough to ensure
local thermodynamic equilibrium, so hydrodynamics should be a valid effective theory.
There will therefore be a hydrodynamic sound mode (5.1), with attenuation (5.2). The
shear viscosity of a Fermi liquid satisfies η/(ε + p) ∝ T −2 [179] and η  ζ [183], so that

(5.2) gives Γ ∝ T −2 . As observed experimentally [178], zero sound smoothly becomes
hydrodynamic sound as the temperature is raised, leading to a maximum between the

Γ ∝ T 2 and Γ ∝ T −2 behaviour of the thermal collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes,
respectively.

5.1.3

Holographic zero sound

Longitudinal modes with sound-like dispersion (5.1) have been observed in a wide range
of holographic models of compressible quantum matter [84, 184–212]. These are models
of systems with non-zero chemical potential µ, and corresponding charge density hJ t i,
with non-vanishing compressibility dhJ t i/dµ. By quantum we mean T = 0, so that

quantum, rather than thermal, effects determine the ground state [213]. We will refer
to such zero-temperature sound modes as holographic zero sound (HZS). The purpose
of the adjective “holographic” is to distinguish these modes from Fermi liquid zero
sound, since as discussed further below, HZS appears in holographic models in which
the dual QFT is not a Fermi liquid.
HZS modes have been found in two classes of holographic models. The first class
is probe brane models [84, 184–188, 190–195, 197–204, 206–212], consisting of gravity
coupled to a U(1) gauge field through a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action,

with tension T , and a coupling constant α of mass dimension [α] = −2. These models

employ the probe limit discussed in section 2.6, taking GN T L20  1 to leading non-

trivial order. We specialize to spacetime-filling branes [214], which is why the second
integral in (5.5) is over all (d + 1) bulk dimensions, although defect branes (which are

not spacetime-filling) can also give rise to HZS modes [184, 188]. In field theory terms,
the probe limit corresponds to charged degrees of freedom making up only a small
proportion of the total number of degrees of freedom, as discussed in section 2.6.
The second class of models exhibiting HZS is Einstein-Maxwell theory [189, 196],

with coupling constant e, possibly coupled to an uncharged scalar field [205]. These
models do not take a probe limit, so the gauge field back-reacts on the metric. In
field theory terms, in back-reacted models the charged fields comprise a non-negligible
74

fraction of the total number of degrees of freedom.
In both classes of models, sound modes appear in zero-temperature solutions in
which G and F depend only on z (in a suitably chosen coordinate system), and the
only non-zero component of the U(1) field strength is an electric field in the holographic
radial direction, giving rise to non-zero chemical potential and charge density in the
dual QFT. For example, in Einstein-Maxwell theory HZS modes appear in the extremal
AdSd+1 -Reissner-Nordström charged black brane solution [189, 196].
There are three examples of compressible quantum matter in traditional condensed
matter physics, Fermi liquids, solids, and superfluids [177–179, 213, 215–217], each of
which supports a low temperature sound mode. Fermi liquids support zero sound, due
to fluctuations of their Fermi surface, while solids and superfluids support phonons due
to their spontaneous breaking of translational and U(1) particle number symmetries,
respectively.
There are holographic systems supporting HZS that do not fall into any of these
three categories, making the physical origin of HZS unclear. HZS modes appear in
holographic systems which have unbroken translational and U(1) global symmetries,
so HZS cannot be a phonon. In addition, the effective description of these holographic
systems differs from Landau Fermi liquid theory in key respects.
Probe brane models do not exhibit a Fermi surface [84, 184–188, 190–195, 197–204,
206–212]. The effective description of these models is that of the hydrodynamics of a
weakly conserved current [212]. Einstein-Maxwell models can have a Fermi surface [157,
218, 219], but violate Luttinger’s theorem: the Fermi surface volume is smaller than hJ t i
by powers of N [189, 196, 205, 210]. As discussed in chapter 4, the near horizon AdS2

of extremal AdSd+1 -Reissner-Nordström indicates that that the low-energy effective
description is a semi-local quantum liquid [158]. This leads to branch cuts in the
retarded Green’s functions of T µν and J µ [189, 220], which are not present in Fermi
liquid two-point functions.
Given these differences, HZS exhibits some remarkable similarities to Fermi liquid
zero sound. The attenuation of HZS in probe brane models behaves identically to zero
sound in the quantum and thermal collisionless regimes [195], as sketched in figure 5.2a.
At very low temperatures, Γ ∼ T 0 analogous to the quantum collisionless regime in
a Fermi liquids. At intermediate temperature, Γ ∼ T 2 like the thermal collisionless

regime. However, the probe limit decouples the bulk U(1) gauge field from the metric,
with the result that the HZS pole appears only in Green’s functions of J µ , and not

those of T µν . As a result, HZS cannot possibly crossover to hydrodynamic sound at
large temperatures. Instead, at large temperatures HZS crosses over to diffusion, with
dispersion given by (5.3). As a result, the sound attenuation exhibits no maximum.
In probe brane models, the crossover to hydrodynamics is instead defined by the
motion of the poles with T /µ in the complex frequency plane [195], sketched in figure 5.2b. At zero temperature, the poles closest to the real axis are the zero sound
poles (the highest black crosses in the figure). As the temperature is raised, the poles
75

move in an approximate semicircle toward the imaginary axis, eventually colliding, and
forming two purely imaginary poles (the red squares in the figure). One of the imaginary poles moves deeper into the complex plane, while the other moves up towards the
real axis, becoming charge diffusion at high temperatures. The critical value of T /µ at
which the poles collide is taken to define the hydrodynamic crossover [195].
In Einstein-Maxwell models, the gauge field back-reacts on the metric. Hence, HZS
modes in these models are poles of both the J µ and T µν two-point functions. As
the temperature is raised, HZS smoothly evolves into the sound pole found in AdSSchwarzschild [83, 221], with attenuation proportional to T −1 , as required by hydrodynamics. Figure 5.2c shows the typical form of the HZS attenuation as a function
of temperature [196]. At low temperatures, the sound attenuation is approximately
temperature-independent, as in the quantum collisionless regime in Fermi liquids. However, there is no range of temperatures for which Γ ∼ T 2 . There is only a small, broad,
maximum in the sound attenuation before the hydrodynamic regime, so the Fermi
liquid definition of the hydrodynamic crossover is impractical.
The motion of the poles in the complex plane is qualitatively much simpler for
Einstein-Maxwell than for probe branes [189, 196]. At zero temperature, there are
HZS poles, and a branch cut along the imaginary axis. At small non-zero temperature,
the branch cut splits into a discrete set of purely imaginary poles. Since the gauge field
back-reacts on the metric, all of these poles appear in both the J µ and T µν Green’s
functions. As the temperature is increased, HZS smoothly evolves into hydrodynamic
sound, while the purely imaginary pole closest to the real axis evolves into charge
diffusion. Since there is no pole collision for Einstein-Maxwell models, the probe brane
definition of the hydrodynamic crossover may not be applied.
Instead, ref. [196] defined the crossover using the spectral function for the charge
density, which we denote ρqq . At low T /µ, ρqq is dominated by a peak due to HZS
modes. As T /µ increases, this peak is suppressed, and a peak produced by the charge
diffusion pole rises. The temperature at which the charge diffusion peak first becomes
taller than the sound peak is taken to define the crossover [196]. No crossover is
apparent in the energy density spectral function, which we denote ρεε , which is always
dominated by the sound pole.
The ubiquity of HZS in holographic models naturally raises the question of whether
sound modes are present more generally in compressible quantum matter. The Fermi
liquid and holographic results provide three possible definitions for the crossover temperature: the maximum in sound attenuation, the collision of poles on the imaginary
axis, and the transfer of dominance in ρqq from the sound peak to the charge diffusion peak. Another natural question is how common each of these behaviours is, and
whether a “universal” definition of the hydrodynamic regime exists, applicable to all
of the cases above, and more generally to all quantum compressible matter.

Arrows show how the poles move as the temperature is increased. At zero temperature
there are two HZS poles (black crosses). As the temperature is increased, the poles
move in approximate semicircles until they collide on the imaginary axis, producing two
purely imaginary poles (red squares). As the temperature is increased still further, one
of the imaginary poles moves towards the real axis, eventually becoming the charge
diffusion pole, with Γ ∼ T −1 . (c): Typical form for the imaginary part of HZS in

At low temperatures there are three poles close to the real axis: a pair with non-zero real
part (the HZS poles), and a purely imaginary pole. As the temperature increases, the
real part of the frequencies stay constant, while their imaginary parts mostly become
less negative. At high temperature, the purely imaginary pole becomes charge diffusion.

5.2

The Model

In order to gain a better understanding of the nature of zero sound in compressible
quantum matter, we will study the fate of zero sound and the hydrodynamic crossover
when we relax the probe limit in the holographic model (5.5). For concreteness, and
ease of comparison to the AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström results presented in ref. [196], we
will set d = 3 for the remainder of this chapter.
It will be convenient at this stage to reparameterise the model slightly. First, we
note that when F = 0 in (5.5), the tension of the brane provides a contribution to the
cosmological constant. As a result, the asymptotic AdS-radius on the gravity side of
our holographic model will be L, given by
L2 ≡

L20
.
1 − 8πGN T L20 /3

(5.7)

We will study the dependence of HZS on the dimensionless tension
τ ≡ 8πGN T L2 ,

(5.8)

which determines the back-reaction of the brane. Note that the probe limit discussed
in section 2.6 is τ  1. In top-down probe brane models, such as the D3-D7 system

discussed in section 2.6, τ would measure the ratio of the number of degrees of freedom
charged under the U(1) global symmetry to the total number of degrees of freedom.
We also define the dimensionless coupling
α̃ ≡ α/L2 ,

(5.9)

which controls the strength of non-linear FM N self-interactions.
In terms of these parameters, the bulk action (5.5) becomes

where 1 is the four-dimensional identity matrix. When α̃  1, we may expand the final

square root up to terms quadratic in α̃, in which case we recover the Einstein-Maxwell
action (5.6).7 The combination τ α̃2 must be kept fixed when taking this limit, so that
the back-reaction of the gauge field on the metric remains finite.
Note that α̃ appears in the action (5.10) only as the prefactor of F . One may
therefore eliminate α̃ by a redefinition of the gauge field, so that changing α̃ is equivalent
Strictly it is the combination α̃L2 G−1 F which must be small to make this expansion. However,
L G−1 F remains O(1) when we take α̃ → 0 on the solution that we study, so it is enough to take α̃ to
be small.

section primarily as a bookkeeping parameter to ease comparison with the EinsteinMaxwell models.

The equations of motion arising from the action (5.10) admit a charged black brane
solution, dual to a CFT at non-zero temperature T and chemical potential µ [214,
222–225]. We will choose coordinates in which the metric and gauge field strength take

The trace of the stress tensor vanishes, since the curvature invariants in (2.5) vanish
individually. The pressure is therefore p = ε/2 (since the CFT is three-dimensional).
From (5.2), the speed of sound in the hydrodynamic regime is then vs2 = 1/2. We note
that for both AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström and probe branes in AdS4 -Schwarzschild, the
speed of HZS is also v 2 = 1/2 [184, 189, 195, 196]. In a Fermi liquid, the speeds of
hydrodynamic and zero sound coincide in the limit of infinite quasiparticle interaction
strength [179].

Quasinormal modes and Green’s functions

We will study linearised fluctuations of the metric and gauge field about the solution (5.11), making use of the formalism of [83]. Let us write the fluctuations as
GM N (z) → GM N (z) + δGM N (z, t, x),

AM (z) → AM (z) + δAM (z, t, x),

(5.20)

where x = (x, y). Substituting these into the equations of motion following from the
action (5.10), and expanding to leading non-trivial order in the fluctuations, one finds
a set of coupled, linear PDEs for δGM N and δAM . We now Fourier transform with
respect to the boundary coordinates,

δGM N (z, t, x) =

dωd2 k −iωt+ik·x
e
δGM N (z, ω, k),
(2π)3

(5.21)

and similar for δAM . Since the background (5.11) is invariant under translations in
t and x, the Fourier modes with different frequencies or momenta decouple in the
equations of motion.

As discussed in section 2.5.2, for a given momentum k, the quasinormal modes are
the values of ω for which there exists a solution with δGM N (z, ω, k) and δAM (z, ω, k)
normalisable at the boundary, and ingoing at the horizon. By rotational invariance in
the x–y plane, these frequencies can depend on the momentum only through its absolute
value k ≡ |k|. Without loss of generality, we may therefore take k to be oriented
along the x direction. Non-zero momentum breaks the SO(2) rotational symmetry

into a Z2 subgroup, under which y → −y. The fluctuations may be classified into

even (longitudinal) and odd (transverse) representations of the residual Z2 , where even
fluctuations are invariant under y → −y, whereas odd fluctuations change sign. The
classification is:
Even:

δGzz , δGtt , δGxx , δGyy , δGzt , δGzx , δGtx , δAz , δAt , δAx .

Odd:

δGzy , δGty , δGxy , δAy .

(5.22)

The two representations decouple, by symmetry, so may be considered separately. We
will restrict to the even channel, which also call the sound channel since it contains the
sound modes. The quasinormal modes and Green’s functions in the odd channel were
computed in ref. [226].

The ten sound-channel fluctuations satisfy ten coupled ordinary differential equations. The problem of extracting the quasinormal modes from these equations may be
simplified by defining the gauge-invariant linear combinations [83, 196, 214, 227],

where indices on δG have been raised using the unperturbed metric (5.11). Substituting
these for δAt and δGt t in the equations of motion, one finds that Z1,2 decouple from
the remaining fluctuations. They satisfy two coupled second-order ordinary differential
equations, of the form

The coefficients B1 and B3 in (5.24) are proportional to τ . Thus, in the probe
limit Z1 drops out of the second equation in (5.24). One may then consistently set
Z2 = 0, and solve the remaining equation of motion for Z1 . The quasinormal modes
one finds in this manner are poles of the sound-channel Green’s functions involving J µ .
Similarly, the poles of the sound-channel T µν Green’s functions are the quasinormal
modes found by solving the second equation in (5.24) for Z2 . Away from the probe
limit, the quasinormal modes are poles of the Green’s functions of both the J µ and T µν
Green’s functions.
We will also compute the spectral functions for the charge and energy densities.
These are defined as
ρqq (ω, k) ≡ i [GJ t J t (ω, k) − GJ t J t (ω, k)∗ ] ,

ρεε (ω, k) ≡ i [GT tt T tt (ω, k) − GT tt T tt (ω, k)∗ ] ,

(5.27)

respectively, where GOQ denotes the retarded Green’s function of operators O and
Q. To compute the quasinormal modes and spectral functions numerically, we use the
shooting method of ref. [84], described in detail in appendix B.2.

5.3

Numerical Results

We now present results for the frequencies of poles in the sound-channel retarded twopoint functions of J µ and T µν , in the state holographically dual to the solution (5.11).
We will use GJJ to collectively denote all of the sound-channel retarded Green’s func82

tions of J µ , and similarly GT T for the T µν Green’s functions. We will focus on the
sound and diffusion poles, and the crossover to hydrodynamic behaviour at large temperatures. We will also compute spectral functions (5.27).
As discussed in section 4.5, in extremal AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström the near-horizon
AdS2 × R2 indicates that the dual CFT state is a semi-local quantum liquid [158].

This leads to branch cuts along the imaginary frequency axis in GJJ and GT T at

T = 0 [189, 220]. At non-zero temperature, this branch cut splits into a discrete set
of purely imaginary poles. We expect the same physics to occur for the back-reacted
brane model, due to the near-horizon AdS2 factor. However, for numerical stability of
our shooting method we will always restrict to non-zero temperature, so we will not see
direct evidence for a branch cut. To obtain accurate results at T = 0, we would need
to use a different numerical method, such as Leaver’s matrix method, which was used
for extremal AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström in refs. [189, 220].
We present our numerical results for the poles in the Green’s functions in section 5.3.1, and for the spectral functions in section 5.3.2. In section 5.3.3 we analyse
the attenuation of the sound poles in detail.

5.3.1

Poles and Dispersion Relations

Changing back-reaction
We will begin in the probe limit, τ = 0, and then move through successively larger
values of τ , seeing how the behaviour of the poles in the Green’s functions changes
with each step.
In the probe limit, the metric and gauge field decouple, so the poles of the GJJ
and GT T are distinct. At T = 0, the metric is that of AdS4 and the GT T are fixed by
conformal invariance. They have no poles, but branch points at ω = ±k and ω = ∞ [27].
When T 6= 0, the metric becomes that of AdS4 -Schwarzschild, and GT T develops poles.
HZS appears as poles of the GJJ Green’s functions at T = 0 [184, 188].

Figure 5.3a shows numerical results for the motion of the poles of GJJ and GT T in
the complex frequency plane as we increase the temperature. Our results are qualitatively the same as the d = 4 results of refs. [83, 176] for GT T and refs. [195, 212] for GJJ .
At low temperature, T /µ = 5×10−4 , we find four poles, two in GT T at Re ω ≈ ±k [83],

denoted by blue dots in figure 5.3a, and two in GJJ with dispersion well approximated
√
by the zero sound dispersion (5.4), with v ≈ 1/ 2 [195, 212], denoted by black crosses
in the figure.

As T /µ is increased, the blue dots move to smaller real part, eventually becoming the
hydrodynamic sound modes at large T /µ, with dispersion (5.1). The black crosses move
in an approximate semicircle, eventually colliding on the imaginary axis at T /µ ≈ 0.033.

As the temperature is increased further, the poles in GJJ become purely imaginary (red
squares in the figure). One of these poles moves deeper into the complex plane as the
temperature is raised, while the other pole moves towards the real axis, eventually

Figure 5.3: Poles of GJJ and GT T , as a function of temperature T /µ, with α̃ = 1 and
k/µ = 10−2 . In the top two plots, the arrows indicate the movement of poles as T /µ
increases. (a): The poles in the complex frequency plane in the probe limit, τ = 0,
for temperatures in the range 5 × 10−4 ≤ T /µ ≤ 0.1. At T /µ = 5 × 10−4 we find four
poles, two in GT T , with Re ω ≈ ±k (blue dots), and two in GJJ , with dispersion well
approximated by the HZS dispersion (5.4) (black crosses). As T /µ increases, the blue
dots move to smaller real part, eventually becoming hydrodynamic sound poles with
dispersion (5.1). The black crosses move toward the imaginary axis in an approximate
semicircle, eventually colliding on the imaginary axis. At higher temperatures, the
poles in GJJ are purely imaginary (red squares). One of these moves up and becomes
the charge diffusion pole. (b): Poles for τ = 10−4 , for 10−4 ≤ T /µ ≤ 0.05. Since τ 6= 0,
all poles are poles of both GJJ and GT T . At T /µ = 10−4 we find HZS poles (black
crosses), and poles with larger real part (blue dots), similar to τ = 0. However, as T /µ
is increased, HZS now smoothly evolves into hydrodynamic sound, and it is the blue
dots which collide on the imaginary axis to eventually form charge diffusion. (c, d):
The real and imaginary parts of the pole frequencies as a function of temperature, for
τ = 10−4 . The colour coding and shapes are the same as in figure (b). The solid and

becoming hydrodynamic charge diffusion, with dispersion (5.3).
We now introduce small back-reaction, setting τ = 10−4 .8 Figure 5.3b shows our
numerical results for the motion of the poles in the complex frequency plane, for 10−4 ≤
T /µ ≤ 0.05, while figures 5.3c and 5.3d show the real and imaginary parts of ω/µ as a
function of T /µ.

At the lowest temperature we studied, T /µ = 10−4 , we again find four poles, two
with Re ω ≈ ±k, again denoted by blue dots, and two HZS poles, again denoted by
black crosses. As T /µ is increased, there is a significant qualitative difference to the
probe limit: the black crosses no longer collide. Instead, they stay at approximately
constant real part and small imaginary part. When T /µ becomes large, the black
crosses become hydrodynamic sound.
It is now the blue dots which are responsible for forming charge diffusion. At low
temperatures they execute motion similar to in the probe limit, until they reach a
closest approach to the black crosses. As the temperature is raised further, the blue
dots trace out an approximate semicircle in the complex plane, similar to the poles
of GJJ in the probe limit. The blue dots eventually collide on the imaginary axis,
at T /µ ≈ 0.029, forming two purely imaginary poles, one of which becomes charge
diffusion. It is therefore still possible to define a precise moment of crossover in the

same way as the probe limit [195], when the two poles collide on the imaginary axis
and produce the charge diffusion pole.
The identification of poles as HZS, hydrodynamic sound, or charge diffusion is made
using their dispersion relations. For example, figure 5.4 shows dispersion relations for
τ = 10−4 , α̃ = 1, T /µ = 10−2 , and momenta in the range 10−4 ≤ k/µ ≤ 0.1. The

colour coding is the same as in the τ = 10−4 plots in figure 5.3.

The black crosses, which exist for all values of k/µ, have sound-like dispersion
√
ω = ±k/ 2 − iΓk 2 + O(k 3 ). From the inset in figure 5.4b, we observe that Γ is well

approximated by the attenuation of the hydrodynamic sound pole in the holographic
dual to AdS4 -Schwarzschild. In fact, as detailed in section 5.3.3, for any τ 6= 0 we find

that the hydrodynamic prediction (5.2) for the attenuation of sound works well even
for T /µ  1.9 The distinction between HZS and hydrodynamic sound at non-zero

back-reaction is therefore a matter of terminology. We will continue to refer to sound
modes at T /µ  1 as HZS, to emphasise the fact that sound modes survive to low
temperatures in these models.

At sufficiently large momenta, we also observe poles with Re ω ≈ ±k, indicated

by blue dots in the figure. Lowering the momentum, around k/µ ≈ 0.02–0.03 the
√
dispersion becomes Re ω ≈ ±k/ 2, similar to the sound modes. However, as the
momentum is lowered still further, we find that the blue dots collide on the imaginary

axis, forming two purely imaginary poles, indicated by red squares. One of these poles
We also studied the motion of the poles for τ = 10−5 , finding qualitatively similar behaviour to
τ = 10−4 .
9
The same phenomenon has been observed in other holographic models [205, 227].

Figure 5.4: Dispersion relations of the four highest poles for τ = 10−4 , α̃ = 1, T /µ =
10−2 , and momenta in the range 10−4 ≤ k/µ ≤ 0.1. The plots show the real (left) and
imaginary (right) parts of ω/µ, as a function of k/µ, with insets detailing the behaviour
at small k/µ. The solid and dashed black lines show the poles in GT T and GJJ in the
probe limit, respectively. The colour coding is consistent with figure 5.3. The black
crosses follow the probe HZS dispersion for large k/µ, and the hydrodynamic sound
dispersion for small k/µ. At large k/µ, the blue dots have the dispersion of the
√ poles
in GT T , with Re (ω) = ±k, but for k/µ ≈ 0.02–0.03, they satisfy Re (ω) = ±k/ 2. For
k/µ . 0.02, the real part of the blue dots rapidly decreases, reaching Re (ω) = 0 around
k/µ ≈ 2 × 10−3 . At lower momenta, the blue dots are replaced by purely imaginary
poles, indicated by the red squares.
moves to zero frequency as k → 0, and is identified with hydrodynamic charge diffusion.
Figure 5.5 shows our numerical results for the poles with larger back-reaction, τ =

10−3 ,

still with α̃ = 1 and k/µ = 10−2 , for temperatures in the range 1.25 × 10−3 ≤

T /µ ≤ 0.05. Figures 5.5a, 5.5b, and 5.5c show how the poles move in the complex
plane as the temperature is changed, with arrows indicating the pole movement as

T /µ increases. Figures 5.5d and 5.5e show the real and imaginary parts of the pole
frequencies as a function of temperature.
At the lowest temperature that we access, T /µ = 1.25 × 10−3 , the closest poles to

the real axis are HZS poles. Deeper into the complex plane, we observe two purely
imaginary poles (green squares and grey diamonds), and a pair of poles with finite real
part (blue dots in figure 5.5a). The purely imaginary poles are presumably remnants
of a branch cut at T = 0.
As the temperature is increased, the sound poles barely move, while the purely
imaginary poles move to more negative imaginary part. The blue dots move towards
the imaginary axis, eventually colliding at T /µ ≈ 2.23 × 10−3 . Crucially, the collision
occurs below the green squares. The collision forms two new purely imaginary poles

(blue dots in figure 5.5b). One of these new poles moves deeper into the complex
plane with increasing temperature. The other moves towards the real axis, eventually

Figure 5.5: Frequencies of poles of GJJ and GT T , with τ = 10−3 , α̃ = 1, k/µ = 0.01,
for temperatures in the range 1.25 × 10−3 ≤ T /µ ≤ 0.05. (a, b, c): The poles in the
complex frequency plane at successively larger values of T /µ, with arrows indicating the
motion with increasing temperature. Sound poles, indicated by black crosses, exist for
all temperatures studied. The motion of the poles and formation of the diffusion pole
is significantly more complicated than for smaller τ . (d, e): The real and imaginary
parts of the frequency as a function of temperature. The colours and shapes of the plot
markers are the same as in the plots of the complex plane.

This second collision creates two new poles, with non-zero real part (orange dots
in figures 5.5b and 5.5c). As the temperature is increased further, the new poles move
away from the imaginary axis and towards the real axis, appearing to approach the
sound poles. They reach a closest approach to the sound poles at T /µ ≈ 0.01, before
turning around and approaching the imaginary axis again. The orange dots eventually

collide on the imaginary axis. This forms two purely imaginary poles (red squares in
figure 5.5c), one of which becomes charge diffusion at high temperature. The probe
limit definition of the hydrodynamic crossover is therefore still viable, despite the more
complicated pole motion, with the crossover temperature given by the temperature of
this final pole collision, T /µ ≈ 0.027.

The key difference between τ = 10−3 and τ = 10−4 is that for τ = 10−3 , the two

low-temperature propagating poles (blue dots) collide on the imaginary axis below a
purely imaginary pole. Thus, neither of the purely imaginary poles created by the
collision can become charge diffusion at high temperatures. Instead, the creation of
the charge diffusion pole at high temperatures occurs via the complicated sequence of
pole motions described above. Clearly there is a critical value of τ between 10−4 and
10−3 , separating the regimes where the pole collision occurs above or below any purely
imaginary modes. We find that this critical value is τ ≈ 9 × 10−4 .

Figure 5.6a shows our numerical results for the pole positions for yet larger back-

reaction, τ = 10−2 , again with α̃ = 1 and k/µ = 10−2 , for temperatures in the range
5 × 10−3 ≤ T /µ ≤ 8.3 × 10−3 . At T /µ = 5 × 10−3 , we find that the closest poles to the

real axis are HZS poles (black crosses in the figure), with Im ω/µ ≈ −2 × 10−5 . There

is also a purely imaginary pole, with Im ω/µ ≈ −2 × 10−3 (red squares). Significantly
deeper into the complex plane, we observe a pair of poles with non-zero real part (blue
dots) and two purely imaginary poles (orange stars and grey diamonds) within the
range of frequencies that we checked.
As the temperature is increased, the orange stars and grey diamonds move deeper
into the complex plane, while the blue dots move towards the imaginary axis. The
black crosses and red squares barely move on the scale of figure 5.6a. The blue dots
eventually collide on the imaginary axis at T /µ ≈ 8.3 × 10−3 , below the red squares

but above any other imaginary poles.

The collision produces two purely imaginary poles (purple diamonds in figure 5.6b),
one of which moves deeper into the complex plane as the temperature is increased, while
the other moves up towards the real axis. However, as shown in figure 5.6c, the latter
pole never collides with the red squares. Instead, it reaches a closest approach, and
then begins to to more negative imaginary part. Thus, the red squares exist as the
purely imaginary poles closest to the real axis for the full range of temperatures that
we study, and at large temperatures become charge diffusion. Figure 5.6d shows how
the imaginary parts of the red squares and black crosses change with temperature.
The poles closest to the real axis are therefore qualitatively similar to those in
AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström for all temperatures; in particular the charge diffusion pole

Figure 5.6: The frequencies of poles of GJJ and GT T for τ = 10−2 , α̃ = 1, k/µ = 10−2 ,
and temperatures in the range 5 × 10−3 ≤ T /µ ≤ 5 × 10−2 . (a, b): The motion of
the poles in the complex frequency plane with changing temperature. Arrows indicate
the movement of poles as T /µ increases. The closest poles to the real axis are always
sound poles (the black crosses) and a purely imaginary pole (red squares). Deeper into
the complex plane, at low temperatures we observe further purely imaginary poles, and
a pair of poles with non-zero real part (the blue dots). As the temperature is raised,
the blue dots move towards the imaginary axis. They eventually collide, forming two
purely imaginary poles (the purple diamonds). (c): The imaginary parts of the poles as
a function of temperature. The orange crosses and grey diamonds have been omitted,
for clarity of presentation. (d): A close-up of (c), focusing on the poles closest to the

remains purely imaginary down to low temperature. We find that the critical value of
τ , above which the charge diffusion pole is purely imaginary for all temperatures, is
τ ≈ 3.2 × 10−3 . We have sampled values of τ up to τ = 10−1 , and found that the pole
evolution remains qualitatively similar. For τ > 3.2 × 10−3 we cannot use the probe

limit definition of the crossover, since at no point do poles collide on the imaginary axis
to produce the hydrodynamic charge diffusion pole.
Larger Momentum
We now study the effect on the poles of GJJ and GT T of increasing the momentum k/µ.
Figure 5.7 shows the behaviour of the poles with increasing temperature, for τ =
10−4 ,

α̃ = 1, and k/µ = 0.1 and k/µ = 1. For k/µ = 0.1, the motion of the poles with

temperature is qualitatively similar to that for τ = 10−4 and k/µ = 10−2 , plotted in
figure 5.3b. At low temperatures, there are two pairs of poles with non-zero real part:
√
a pair with Re ω ≈ ±k/ 2 (the black crosses in the figure), and a pair with Re ω ≈ ±k

(the blue dots).10 As the temperature is increased, the blue dots move toward the
imaginary axis, eventually colliding and forming two purely imaginary poles. The
main qualitative difference to the k/µ = 10−2 is that the blue dots and black crosses
are much closer to each other at their point of closest approach.
For k/µ = 1, the motion of the poles is qualitatively similar to that for k/µ = 10−2
in the probe limit, τ = 0, plotted in figure 5.3a. At low temperature, there is a pair of
poles with Re ω ≈ ±k (the black crosses in the figure), and another pair of poles with

smaller | Re ω| (the blue dots). As the temperature is increased, the black crosses move
√
to Re ω ≈ k/ 2, becoming the sound poles at large T /µ, while the blue dots collide on
the imaginary axis to form the diffusion pole.

Figure 5.8 shows the frequencies of the poles for τ = 10−2 , α̃ = 1, and k/µ = 0.1
and k/µ = 1. For both values of k/µ, the behaviour of the poles is qualitatively similar
to that for τ = 10−4 and the same k/µ. In particular, the purely imaginary pole which
becomes hydrodynamic charge diffusion at high temperatures is created by the collision
of two propagating poles on the imaginary axis. This is in stark contrast to τ = 10−2
and k/µ = 10−2 , where no such collision occurs.
For both values of τ , with increasing k/µ the frequencies of the poles as functions
of temperature approach the frequencies found at the same momentum in the probe
limit, indicated by the solid and dashed back lines in figures 5.7 and 5.8. Evidently, the
poles of the Green’s functions are less sensitive to the back-reaction when k/µ is large.
Since the gravity theory is invariant under the combined rescaling α̃ → λα̃ and

FM N → λ−1 FM N (and therefore µ → λ−1 µ), increasing k/µ for fixed α̃ is equivalent to
decreasing α̃ for fixed k/µ. Hence, the results of this section also imply that at fixed τ

and k/µ, the poles approach those of the probe limit as α̃ is decreased. This is intuitive,
since for small values of α̃ we expect to obtain a good approximation by expanding the
action (5.10) up to quadratic order in α̃F . In this truncated action, the back-reaction
10

The colour coding is the same as in 5.4; that is, the black crosses have sound-like dispersion at
small values of k/µ.

Spectral Functions

In this section we present our numerical results for the charge and energy spectral functions, ρqq and ρεε , defined in (5.27). In both probe brane and Einstein-Maxwell models,
√
at low temperatures ρqq exhibits a peak at ω ≈ k/ 2, due to the HZS mode [184, 189,
195, 196]. We find that the same is true in our model, for all levels of back-reaction.

At high temperatures, the equations of hydrodynamics imply that ρqq exhibits a peak
near ω = 0. We will examine in detail how ρqq interpolates between these two regimes.
We will compare our numerical results to an approximation of the Green’s functions
as a sum over poles,
(n)

Gab (ω, k) ≈

X
n

Rab (k)
(n)

ω − ω∗ (k)

,

(5.28)

(n)

where ω∗ (k) are our numerical results for the highest poles, specifically the sound poles
(n)

and the next highest pole or pair of poles, and Rab (k) is a matrix of pole residues, which

are generically complex-valued. The method used to compute the spectral functions
(n)

and the matrix of residues Rab is explained in appendix B.2.

In principle, the Green’s functions need not take such a simple form (5.28), and

one should use a Mittag-Leffler expansion, for example including terms analytic in frequency [228]. However, a sum over poles provides a good approximation to the spectral
functions of extremal AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström [189]. We find that the approximation (5.28) works well for many, but not all, values of temperature, back-reaction, and
momentum that we study, indicating that the spectral functions are often dominated
by their poles.
Figure 5.9 shows our numerical results for ρqq and ρεε , for τ = 10−5 , α̃ = 1,
k/µ = 0.01 and T /µ = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03. In the figure, the black dots are the
result of direct numerical calculation of ρqq and ρεε , while the solid grey curves are
the spectral functions obtained from the sum-over-poles approximation to the Green’s
functions in equation (5.28).
In both ρqq and ρεε , at T /µ = 0.01 we find a peak from the sound pole at
√
ω ≈ k/ 2.11 As T /µ increases through the values shown, in ρqq the sound peak’s

height decreases, while in ρεε the height increases, indicating that as T /µ increases, the
sound pole’s residue decreases in GJ t J t but increases in GT tt T tt . In addition, as T /µ
increases, the charge density spectral function develops a second, broader peak, due to
an additional pole with non-zero real part. As the temperature is increased, this peak
becomes taller, eventually providing the dominant contribution to ρqq . The frequency of
the peak decreases with increasing T /µ. In terms of the poles in the Green’s functions,
The positions of the poles for τ = 10−5 , α̃ = 1, and k/µ = 0.01 are qualitatively similar to the
results for τ = 10−4 plotted in figure 5.3.

Figure 5.9: Numerical results for the charge density spectral function ρqq (left column)
and energy density spectral function ρεε (right column), for τ = 10−5 , α̃ = 1, and
k/µ = 0.01. The plots show results for T /µ = 0.01 (top row), 0.02 (middle row), and
0.03 (bottom row). The black points are direct numerical results, while the grey curves
show the spectral functions obtained using the sum-over-poles approximation
(5.28).
√
At T /µ = 0.01, both spectral functions exhibit peaks at ω ≈ k/ 2, due to the sound
pole. As the temperature is raised, the energy density spectral function continues to
be dominated by the sound pole. The charge density spectral function develops a new,
broad peak at smaller values of ω/µ. By T /µ = 0.03 this peak provides the dominant
contribution to the spectral function. At large temperatures the new peak becomes the
charge diffusion peak.

94

this transfer of dominance occurs because of the relative sizes of the residues of the
poles. The second peak also moves to smaller frequencies with increasing temperature,
eventually becoming the charge diffusion peak.
This changeover in poles dominating the charge density spectral function also occurs
in AdS-Reissner-Nordström [196], and contrasts with the probe limit, in which the
charge density spectral function only ever exhibits a single peak [195]. In principle, one
could define the crossover to hydrodynamic behaviour as occurring at the value of T /µ
for which the two peaks in ρqq have equal height, as in ref. [196]. In practice, however,
one of the peaks is so broad that it is difficult to identify precisely when this occurs.
The definition of the crossover using the spectral functions is therefore unreliable at
small back-reaction.
The pole which produces the second peak in ρqq does not provide a significant
contribution to the energy density spectral function, which remains dominated by the
sound pole as the temperature is increased. This is because the residue of the sound
pole in GT tt T tt is always much larger than the residue of the second pole.
The sum-over-poles approximation works well for most values of T /µ. However,
the approximation seems to break down for ρqq around T /µ ≈ 0.02. We have not

found any other poles which provide a significant contribution to the spectral functions
for temperatures in this range, so the failure of the approximation is not due to the
truncation to a small number of poles. It appears that for T /µ ≈ 0.02 there are

significant contributions to ρqq that are analytic in frequency.

Figure 5.10 shows our numerical results for the spectral functions for τ = 10−4 ,
α̃ = 1, k/µ = 0.01, and T /µ = 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05. The results are qualitatively
similar to the τ = 10−5 results plotted in figure 5.9. In particular, the charge density
spectral function exhibits a sound peak at T /µ = 0.01, and develops a second peak as
the temperature is raised, which eventually dominates at sufficiently large temperature.
The separation between these two peaks is greater than for τ = 10−5 , allowing us to
identify the temperature at which they are of equal height as T /µ ≈ 0.039. This
is larger than crossover temperature obtained using the probe limit definition — the
temperature of pole collision — which was T /µ ≈ 0.029.

Figures 5.11 and 5.12 show the spectral functions for τ = 10−3 and τ = 10−2

respectively, with α̃ = 1 and k/µ = 0.01. The results are qualitatively similar to
those for τ = 10−5 and τ = 10−4 . In particular, the charge density spectral function
exhibits two distinct peaks for sufficiently large T /µ, while the energy density spectral
function exhibits only a single peak. The main qualitative change is that the two peaks
in ρqq become narrower with increasing τ . We find that the peaks have equal height
at T /µ ≈ 0.136 for τ = 10−3 , and T /µ ≈ 1.45 for τ = 10−2 . In contrast, defining

the crossover by the collision of poles that produces the charge diffusion pole gave
T /µ ≈ 0.027 for τ = 10−3 , while for τ = 10−2 no pole collision occurs. For both values

of τ , the spectral functions are insensitive to the details of the motion of the poles in
the complex plane plotted in figures 5.5 and 5.6.

√
At T /µ = 0.5, both spectral functions exhibit peaks at ω ≈ k/ 2, due to the sound
pole. As the temperature is raised, the energy density spectral function continues to
be dominated by the sound pole. The charge density spectral function develops a new
peak at smaller values of ω/µ. The two peaks have equal height for T /µ ≈ 1.45. For
larger values of T /µ, the peak at smaller ω/µ provides the dominant contribution to
the spectral function. At large temperatures it becomes the charge diffusion peak.

98

In summary, for k/µ = 10−2 , α̃ = 1, and all non-zero τ that we study, the
charge density spectral function ρqq exhibits temperature-dependence similar to in
AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström; it is dominated by a sound peak at low temperature, and a
diffusion peak at high temperature. We may therefore take the crossover to hydrodynamics as occurring when the two peaks have equal height. However, for small τ we
find that the diffusion peak is very broad at low temperatures, which can make precise
determination of the crossover temperature difficult.
We now give a couple of examples of the behaviour of spectral functions at larger
momentum. Figure 5.13 shows the spectral functions for τ = 10−4 , α̃ = 1, and k/µ =
0.1, for a range of values of T /µ. In section 5.3.1 we saw that fixing τ and increasing
k/µ makes the poles of the Green’s functions behave more like in the probe limit. In
figure 5.13 we see that the same is true for the spectral functions. Concretely, the charge
density spectral function only ever exhibits a single peak over the range of frequencies
√
we plot. At the lowest temperature plotted, T /µ = 0.02, this peak is at ω/µ ≈ k/ 2.

It arises due to the sound pole. As the temperature is increased, the peak moves to

smaller values of the frequency, becoming the charge diffusion pole at high temperature.
Figure 5.14 shows our results for the spectral functions for τ = 10−2 , α̃ = 1, and
k/µ = 0.1. This case qualitatively resembles the results for k/µ = 10−2 , with the charge
density spectral function exhibiting two peaks over a range of temperatures. At low
√
temperature, ρqq is dominated by a peak at ω/µ ≈ k/ 2, while at high temperature it

is dominated by a peak at small ω/µ. The two peaks have equal height at T /µ ≈ 0.21.

Our results show that the definition of the crossover in terms of the spectral func-

tions is viable only for sufficiently large τ and sufficiently small k/µ. If either the
back-reaction is small or the momentum is large, the charge density spectral function
behaves as in the probe limit, exhibiting only a single peak at any given temperature.
For many of the parameter values that we have plotted, the sum over poles (5.28)
provides an excellent approximation to the spectral functions. However, for given values
of τ , α̃, and k/µ there is often a range of temperatures for which the approximation
breaks down. In all of the cases where the sum over poles fails to provide a good
approximation to a spectral function, we find that there are two poles with similar values
of Re ω both providing a significant contribution to that spectral function. When this
happens, it seems likely that analytic terms in the spectral functions become important
due to destructive interference in the contributions of the different poles.

At T /µ = 0.02, the charge density spectral function is dominated
by the HZS pole

(the black crosses in figure 5.7a), with a peak at ω/µ ≈ k/ 2. As the temperature
is raised, the peak moves to smaller frequency, eventually becoming charge diffusion.
Unlike previous examples, we do not observe multiple peaks in ρqq at any temperature,
so the AdS-Reissner-Nordström definition of the crossover may not be used. In this
case, the qualitative behaviour of the spectral functions is similar to that in the probe
limit [195].

Sound Attenuation

In this section we present our results for the sound attenuation, i.e. the imaginary part
of the sound pole (either HZS or hydrodynamic sound), as a function of τ , k/µ and
T /µ. We will also compare the results to the attenuation of Fermi liquid zero sound
sketched in figure 5.1.
As reviewed in section 5.1.3, in probe brane models HZS exhibits a low-temperature
regime, where Im ω ∝ T 0 similar to the quantum collisionless regime of zero sound in

Fermi liquids, and an intermediate-temperature regime where Im ω ∝ T 2 , similar to
the thermal collisionless regime. However, due to the probe limit, the HZS poles are

poles only of GJJ , not GT T , so HZS cannot crossover to hydrodynamic sound at high
temperature. Instead, HZS crosses over to charge diffusion.
On the other hand, HZS in AdS-Reissner-Nordström does crossover to hydrodynamic sound at high temperature. It also obeys Im ω ∝ T 0 at low temperatures, but

does not go through a regime with Im ω ∝ T 2 at intermediate temperature. We will

demonstrate how turning on a non-zero back-reaction allows us to interpolate between
the probe brane and AdS-Reissner-Nordström behaviours.
Figure 5.15 shows our results for ln |Im ω/µ| as a function of ln (T /µ) for α̃ =

1, k/µ = 0.01, and values of τ between τ = 10−5 and τ = 2. Also plotted are
numerical results for probe brane HZS (the solid grey curve), sound modes in AdS4 Schwarzschild (dashed grey) [83, 221], and sound modes in AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström
(purple stars) [196].
For all of the values of τ displayed in figure 5.15, at sufficiently low temperature
the attenuation of HZS is approximately independent of temperature, similar to the
quantum collisionless regime of zero sound in Fermi liquids. Eventually, when the
temperature becomes large enough, the attenuation begins to increase, at a rate that
depends on τ . For the smallest non-zero value of τ that we study, τ = 10−5 (the pink
diamonds in figure 5.15), the attenuation in this regime is very close to that in the probe
limit, with | Im ω| ∝ T 2 similar to the thermal collisionless regime of Fermi liquid zero
sound. For larger values of τ the attenuation increases more slowly with temperature.

For τ 6= 0, as the temperature is increased further, HZS smoothly evolves into

hydrodynamic sound, with attenuation that decreases with temperature as | Im ω| ∝

T −1 . This power of T contrasts with the | Im ω| ∝ T −2 behaviour in the hydrodynamic

regime of a Fermi liquid, and occurs because our holographic model describes a CFT at
finite temperature. The attenuation exhibits a global maximum, dividing the regions
where the attenuation either increases or decreases with temperature. The temperature
at which this maximum occurs is the Landau Fermi liquid definition of the crossover
to hydrodynamics.
The vertical dashed black lines in figure 5.15 represent the boundaries between
quantum collisionless, thermal collisionless, and hydrodynamic regimes in Fermi liquids,

Probe zero sound

Figure 5.15: Numerical results for the logarithm of the sound attenuation, ln | Im ω/µ|,
as a function of ln (T /µ) for α̃ = 1, k/µ = 0.01, and various values of τ , as well as
the AdS4 -Reissner-Nordström result (the purple stars). The solid grey curve is the
attenuation of HZS in the probe limit, while the dashed grey curve is the attenuation
of sound modes in AdS4 -Schwarzschild, i.e. the attenuation of poles in GT T in the
probe limit. The vertical dashed black lines indicate the boundaries between quantum
collisionless,√thermal collisionless, and
√ hydrodynamic regimes in Landau Fermi liquids,
πT /µ ≈ k/ 2 µ and (πT /µ)2 ≈ k/ 2 µ respectively. At sufficiently low temperature,
| Im ω| ∝ T 0 , similar to the quantum collisionless regime of zero sound in Fermi liquids.
As T /µ is increased, the HZS poles eventually enter a regime where ln | Im ω/µ| increases
with T /µ, at a rate dependent on τ . At high temperatures, for all non-zero τ that we
study, HZS crosses over to hydrodynamic sound, with | Im ω| ∝ T −1 . The value of T /µ
at which the attenuation exhibits a global maximum is the Fermi liquid definition of
the hydrodynamic crossover.

Figure 5.16: The imaginary part of the sound mode as a function of temperature for
τ = 10−4 , α̃ = 1, and a range of values of k/µ. The plot on the right shows the same
data as the plot on the left, but with the frequency and temperature measured in units
of k rather than µ. For all k/µ that we have checked, the attenuation behaves similarly
with temperature. At low temperature, | Im ω| ∝ T 0 . As the temperature is increased,
| Im ω| begins to grow, eventually reaching a maximum, then decreasing as Im ω ∝ T −1 .
exhibits a maximum at the latter boundary, as shown in figure 5.1. The results in
figure 5.15 show that changes in behaviour of Im ω do not occur at the same values of
T /µ in our holographic model as in Fermi liquids, despite the qualitative similarity in
the functional form of Im ω/µ.
We now investigate the effect on the sound attenuation of changing the momentum.
Figure 5.15 shows the imaginary part of the sound poles as a function of temperature,
for τ = 10−4 , α̃ = 1, and a range of values of k/µ. For all of the values of k/µ
that we plot, the functional form of Im ω/µ is similar to that for k/µ = 0.01. There
is a low-temperature regime where | Im ω| ∝ T 0 , an intermediate-temperature regime
where Im ω grows with T , and a high-temperature regime where Im ω ∝ T −1 . There

is therefore always a maximum in Im ω/µ as a function of T /µ, so the Fermi liquid
definition of the crossover to hydrodynamics may always be used.
In figure 5.16, the results for k/µ = 1 conflict with a pattern of limT →0 | Im ω/µ|

increasing with k/µ. For k/µ = 1, the sound pole smoothly evolves into a pole with
Re ω ≈ k as the temperature is decreased (the black crosses in figure 5.7d) while the

diffusion pole evolves into a pole with Re ω < k (blue dots in the figure). For smaller
values of k/µ, precisely the opposite is true; see figures 5.3c and 5.7c for k/µ = 0.01
and k/µ = 0.1 respectively. It is this exchange in the evolution of the hydrodynamic
poles to low temperatures which causes the attenuation at k/µ = 1 to break with the
pattern in figure 5.16.
It was pointed out in [227], using the numerical results of [196], that in AdS4 Reissner-Nordström the hydrodynamic prediction for sound attenuation holds even at
very low temperatures, in the following sense [205, 227]. Hydrodynamics predicts that

Figure 5.17: Numerical results for ln (µΓ) versus ln (T /µ), for α̃ = 1. We obtain Γ
by numerically fitting −Γk 2 + ∆k 4 to the sound pole’s Im (ω) over the range of k/µ
listed in table 5.1. The curves show the hydrodynamic prediction (5.30) for the sound
attenuation Γs , which agrees well with our numerical results.

(5.29)

This was obtained by setting d = 3, p = ε/2, and ζ = 0 in (5.2).12 For rotationally
invariant holographic models in which the gravitational theory is Einstein gravity coupled to matter, the shear viscosity takes the universal value η = s/4π [11, 13, 14]. We
may therefore rewrite the sound attenuation (5.29) entirely in terms of thermodynamic
quantities,

(5.30)

Ref. [227] observed that the dispersion relation (5.1), with attenuation given by (5.30),
agrees with the numerical results for the sound pole frequencies in AdS4 -ReissnerNordström even at low temperature, provided k  µ.

We find that the same is true in our model, as shown in figure 5.17. The points

show our numerical results for the sound attenuation Γ as a function of temperature
for a range of τ . Each point is obtained by fitting a functional form −Γk 2 + ∆k 4

to the imaginary part of ω. The ranges of values of k/µ used for the fits are listed in

table 5.1. The solid lines are the hydrodynamic predictions Γs for each value of τ , given
by (5.30) with entropy and energy densities given by (5.15) and (5.16), respectively.
The numerical results and the hydrodynamic prediction agree well over the range of

The holographic dual to AdS-Reissner-Nordström is a conformal field theory at finite temperature
and chemical potential. Conformal field theories have p = ε/(d − 1) and vanishing bulk viscosity, ζ =
0, due to tracelessness of the stress tensor [175].

Ref. [227] also found that the diffusion mode in the shear channel of AdS4 -ReissnerNordström is also well described by hydrodynamics even at low temperatures. The
same was found to be true in our Einstein-DBI model in ref. [226]. It therefore appears
that hydrodynamics provides a good effective description of both the sound and shear
diffusion poles of this model, even for momenta large compared to the temperature,
provided k  µ. Similar behaviour has been observed in a holographic model of a
Fermi liquid [205].

Discussion

We have computed the poles of the sound-channel retarded Green’s functions of J µ and
T µν in the holographic dual to the Einstein-DBI charged black brane. For all levels of
back-reaction, we observe a mode with sound-like dispersion at low temperatures. The
way in which the hydrodynamic charge diffusion pole emerges at high temperature is
very different at different levels of back-reaction.
We have studied three different definitions of the temperature of crossover to hydrodynamic behaviour: the temperature at which two poles collide on the imaginary
axis to produce the charge diffusion pole (the probe limit definition), the temperature
at which the charge density spectral function becomes dominated by charge diffusion
(the AdS-Reissner-Nordström definition), and the temperature of maximum sound attenuation (the Fermi liquid definition).
For given values of τ , α̃, and k/µ, each of these definitions gives different values of
the crossover temperature. For example, figure 5.18 shows our numerical results for the
three different crossover temperatures as a function of τ , for α̃ = 1 and k/µ = 0.01.
Not all of the definitions of the crossover temperature may be viable for given values
of the parameters. We found that the collision of poles only occurs for sufficiently small
τ . In contrast, it is numerically difficult to distinguish the separate peaks in the spectral
function at small τ , hence the apparent numerical noise in the spectral function results
in figure 5.18b for log10 τ . −4.5. The maximum in the sound attenuation appears to

In section 5.3.3, we found that the hydrodynamic result for the sound attenuation

works well even at very small values of T /µ, provided k/µ is also sufficiently small
(although k may be large compared to T ). Why, then, does it make sense to define
a crossover to hydrodynamic behaviour? The various definitions of the crossover are
defined at a given value of k/µ, so they should be interpreted as guidelines as to the
minimum temperature at which hydrodynamics applies at that specific value of the
momentum. For example, at τ = 10−4 , α̃ = 1, k/µ = 0.01, and T /µ = 0.01 the Green’s
functions are clearly not well described by hydrodynamics since there is no charge
diffusion pole, see figure 5.3, and the charge density spectral function is dominated
by the sound pole, figure 5.10. On the other hand, at T /µ = 0.05 there is a purely
imaginary diffusion pole which dominates the charge density spectral function.
In the probe limit, τ = 0, the poles in GT T and GJJ decouple. The effective theory
governing the poles in GT T closest to the real axis is uncharged hydrodynamics [83],
while at low temperature the effective theory governing the poles in GJJ appears to be
the quasihydrodynamics of a weakly conserved current [212, 229]. At high temperature,
the poles of both GT T and GJJ are well described by hydrodynamics with a U(1)
current.
In our Einstein-DBI model, for τ 6= 0 we find that hydrodynamics works well

even at low temperature, provided k/µ is sufficiently small, similar to AdS-ReissnerNordström. If k/µ is increased, the spectral functions and their poles tend to those of
the probe limit, so the appropriate effective description at low temperature appears to
become quasihydrodynamics. The range of k/µ for which hydrodynamics provides a
107

good effective description appears to increase with increasing τ . Recalling that τ should
measure the fraction of degrees of freedom charged under the U(1) global symmetry,
it appears that the effective description of low temperature sound modes at a given
momentum is controlled by the number of charged degrees of freedom, at least in the
class of models considered in this chapter.
Many holographic models of non-Fermi liquids support low temperature sound
modes. The most important question to address is whether any real non-Fermi liquids,
such as the cuprates and graphene similarly support low temperature sound modes.
As a step towards answering this question, low-temperature sound modes in other
holographic models of non-Fermi liquids should be analysed. If every such model supports low temperature sound modes, this would suggest that HZS is a universal feature
of holographic compressible quantum matter. Alternatively, if HZS is not universal,
one could look for criteria that distinguish models with and without low temperature
sound, and test whether the same criteria hold outside of holography.
For example, it has been observed that HZS appears in models where the charge density has non-zero spectral weight at zero temperature and non-zero momentum [210].13
This is particularly striking in probe brane models, where the spectral weight decreases
exponentially with increasing momentum, becoming extremely small at momentum
large compared to a characteristic scale set by the charge density. In ref. [210] this was
given a possible interpretation as a Fermi surface smeared out by strong interactions.
If HZS turns out to be universal in holographic models, this would hint that low
temperature sound modes may exist in compressible quantum matter beyond the traditional systems of Fermi liquids, solids, and superfluids. A comprehensive understanding
of HZS may provide useful guidance in the study of low-temperature sound in real-world
systems.

Wilson surfaces and RG flows
In this chapter we will use gauge/gravity duality to compute entanglement entropy
for surface defects in the QFT describing the low energy excitations of a stack of M5branes. We first provide some background on the M5-brane QFT, the surface defects
we study, and their holographic duals in sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. Then, in each
of sections 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6, we review probe brane solutions holographically dual
to different surface defects in the M5-brane QFT, before presenting our results for
entanglement entropy. The solutions studied in sections 6.5 and 6.6 are holographically
dual to defect RG flows, and in these cases we test the monotonicity of the on-shell
action in the entanglement wedge proposed in ref. [120].

6.1

M-theory and N = (2, 0) theory

As described in chapter 2, the low energy excitations of a stack of coincident D-branes
are described by supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [230]. Similarly, in M-theory the
low energy excitations of a stack of M2-branes are described by Aharony-BergmanJafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory, maximally supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory
coupled to matter [68–72].
The theory describing the low energy excitations of a stack of N5 > 1 M5-branes
is not known. However, some information about the theory may be deduced from
supergravity. The theory is six-dimensional, since M5-branes are six-dimensional, and
from the supersymmetries preserved by the supergravity solution (2.10) one finds that
the M5-brane theory possesses N = (2, 0) supersymmetry.1

The massless fields of the M5-brane theory are the Goldstone modes of the symme-

tries of 11D SUGRA spontaneously broken by the M5-brane solution (2.10) [231]. The
field content for a single M5-brane is:
• Five real scalar fields, from the partial breaking of translational symmetry in the
five directions normal to the brane.

1

The notation “(2, 0)” means there are two left- and no right-handed supersymmetry generators.

109

• A two-form gauge field, with self-dual field strength, from the breaking of large
gauge transformations of the bulk three-form gauge field C3 .

• Four symplectic Majorana-Weyl spinors, arising from the broken supersymmetry.
These fields form the tensor multiplet of N = (2, 0) supersymmetry. For N5 coincident

M5-branes, these fields are expected to become valued in the adjoint representation of
an su(N5 ) gauge algebra [232].
The N = (2, 0) theory is clearly not an ordinary gauge theory, since the gauge field

is a two-form. To date, no action for the non-abelian (N5 > 1) theory has been found.2

Indeed, various arguments have been made that no such action exists, i.e. that the nonabelian N = (2, 0) theory is non-Lagrangian, see for example ref. [233] and references

therein. Gauge/gravity duality provides a powerful tool to study the M5-brane theory.
When N5  1, the world volume theory is expected to be holographically dual to 11D

SUGRA on AdS7 × S4 [10]; in particular the theory is expected to be a superconformal
field theory (SCFT).

Beyond the important role that the N = (2, 0) theory plays in M-theory, it is

notable among quantum field theories as it is the maximally supersymmetric theory
in six-dimensions, which is the largest number of dimensions in which superconformal
symmetry is possible [234]. Study of compactifications of this theory and other 6D
SCFTs has revealed intriguing properties of lower dimensional quantum field theories,
such as the conjectured relation between four-dimensional N = 2 gauge theories and

Liouville or Toda theories in two dimensions [235, 236].

Various supergravity calculations, holographic and otherwise, indicate that the
number of massless degrees of freedom in su(N5 ) N = (2, 0) theory scales as N53 at
large N5 [64, 65, 237–239]. For example, a holographic calculation shows that the
thermodynamic entropy density s of the N = (2, 0) theory at finite temperature T is

s = 27 3−6 π 3 N53 T 5 for N5  1. This contrasts with N  1 D-branes, described by
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, for which the number of degrees of freedom scales
as N 2 as discussed in section 2.4.
The observables of N = (2, 0) theory are believed to be Wilson surfaces [240],

the holonomy of the two-form gauge field A on a two-dimensional surface Σ. In the
abelian theory, a term involving the scalar fields of the tensor multiplet may be added
to create the half-BPS Wilson surface, similar to the half-BPS Wilson loop (2.38).
See ref. [241] for an explicit construction. It is believed that the non-Abelian Wilson
surface may be similarly deformed into a half-BPS Wilson surface, although there is no
explicit formula for the operator since the non-Abelian N = (2, 0) theory has not been
formulated. There is a natural candidate for the holographic dual to the non-Abelian
half-BPS Wilson suface: supersymmetric configurations of M2-branes that intersect
the boundary of AdS7 along the surface Σ [85, 242, 243]. This is similar to the duality
2

We will discuss an action for the abelian theory in section 6.3.

Figure 6.1: In this chapter we use a spherical entangling region, of radius ` (shaded
red in the diagram), centered on a planar (1+1)-dimensional defect (the thick, vertical
line, with dots indicating that the defect extends to infinity). The intersection of the
entangling region with the defect is an interval of length 2`. For conformal defects,
the contribution of the defect to the entanglement entropy takes the form (6.3) of the
entanglement entropy for a single interval in a 2D CFT. The coordinates x and ρ are
defined in section 6.3.

discussed in section 2.5.3.

6.2

Defect entanglement entropy

We will use gauge/gravity duality to compute entanglement entropy in N = (2, 0)
theory in the presence of two-dimensional defects. A subset of the defects we study

are the half-BPS Wilson surface operators [85, 242–244], and in these cases our results
reproduce the probe limit of the calculations in refs. [5, 245]. We will also study
holographic solutions dual to defect renormalisation group (RG) flows, in which Wilson
surfaces appear as fixed points.
For simplicity, we will restrict to planar defects, and choose the entangling region to
be a sphere of radius ` centered at a point on the defect, as illustrated in figure 6.1. In
a CFT in six dimensions, the entanglement entropy SE of a spherical subregion takes
the form (3.12) [109, 110]

The entanglement entropy of an interval of length ∝ ` in a two-dimensional CFT

takes the same form as (6.3), with c the central charge c of the CFT [106]. The central

charge of a 2D CFT measures the number of degrees of freedom in the theory. One of
the questions we will seek to address is whether c similarly measures degrees of freedom
on two-dimensional defects.
For defect RG flows, we may naturally define an `-dependent function

(6.5)

where cUV and cIR are the coefficients at the UV and IR fixed points, respectively.
In two dimensions, the logarithmic derivative of the single-interval entanglement
entropy with respect to the length of the interval satisfies a strong monotonicity theorem
[246], so it decreases monotonically along any RG flow. On the other hand, we find that
for the flows we study C(`) is not monotonic, and may be larger in the IR than in the
UV. This provides an obstruction to interpreting c as a measure of degrees of freedom.
This is consistent with the observations of ref. [247], who found similar behaviour for
other defect RG flows.
Another candidate measure of defect degrees of freedom is the type A anomaly
coefficient, b, of of the defect contribution to the Weyl anomaly (2.7). As discussed
3
We assume that the same regularisation prescription is used for the entanglement entropy in the
defect CFT as in the theory without the defect.
4
Note that in a CFT the O(0 ) term in (6.3) must be independent of `, since the entanglement
entropy is dimensionless and there are no other scales which may be combined with ` to yield a
dimensionless quantity.

112

in section 2.1.2, in ref. [47] it was shown that b obeys a weak monotonicity theorem,
bUV ≥ bIR , for defect RG flows triggered by a source for a relevant operator. We find
that b obeys this inequality for the holographic flows that we construct in sections 6.5

and 6.6, despite the fact that the theorem of ref. [47] does not necessarily hold since the
flows we study are triggered by a VEV rather than a source. We also find that another
Weyl anomaly coefficient, d2 , decreases along these flows. We note that in ref. [6] it
was found that c is related to b and d2 by

Probe branes in AdS7 × S4

The equations of motion of D = 11 SUGRA, which follow from the action (2.9), admit
the solution (2.10), which for p = 5 corresponds to a flat stack of N5 = L3 /π`3P M5branes. Taking the near horizon limit, r  L, the metric becomes that of AdS7 × S4 .
It will be convenient to define a new radial coordinate, z, by r = 4L3 /z 2 , in terms of
which the near-horizon solution becomes

SUGRA on this background is conjectured to be holographically dual to the N = (2, 0)

We will study (1 + 1)-dimensional planar defects, which we will take to span the

6.3.1

M-brane actions

In the presence of an M2- or M5-brane, the action for 11D SUGRA becomes
S = Sbulk + Sbrane ,

(6.10)

where Sbulk is the bulk action (2.9) for the eleven-dimensional supergravity fields, and
Sbrane = SM2 or SM5 is a contribution localized to the brane. We will always work in
the probe limit described in section 2.6, in which it is a good approximation to neglect
the back-reaction of the brane on the metric and gauge field, which we may therefore
take to be the AdS7 × S4 solution (6.8). The brane action Sbrane is then an action for
the world volume fields of the brane, decoupled from the bulk supergravity fields.

For a single M2-brane, the bosonic world volume fields are eight real scalars, which
determine the embedding of the brane. They are described by the action [249]

For a single M5-brane, the bosonic fields are five real scalar fields and an abelian
two-form gauge field A, with self-dual field strength F3 ≡ dA. Various formulations

of M5-brane dynamics exist, which impose the self-duality constraint in different ways

[250–256]. The different formulations are believed to be equivalent, at least classically
[256, 257]. We will use the approach of Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin (PST) [251–253], which
we find to be the simplest for our purposes. In this approach, the self-duality constraint
is imposed by an additional local symmetry due to the presence of an auxiliary scalar
field a. The bosonic part of the PST action for a single M5-brane is [251]

We seek brane embeddings that span the defect (the (t, x) plane) at the boundary.
We will study only a single M2-brane embedding, with AdS3 world volume. For the
M5-brane embeddings, near the boundary the geometry of the brane’s world volume
will be AdS3 × S3 , where the S3 is either the S3 inside AdS7 parameterised by the φi , or

is internal to the S4 , parameterised by the χi . This S3 is supported by flux of the world
volume gauge field A, sourced by M2-brane charge dissolved within the M5-brane. The
total number of dissolved M2-branes N2 is given by the flux quantization condition [248]

(6.13)

A subset of the M5-brane embeddings we consider are believed to be dual to halfBPS Wilson surface operators, in representations described by Young tableaux with
number of boxes N2 of the order of the rank (∼ N5 ) of the gauge algebra or smaller
[242–244]. This is analogous to the holographic description of Wilson lines in N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory (SYM) by D-branes [87, 89–91]. The probe approximation

should hold provided the condition (2.40) is satisfied, which for N2 M2-branes implies
N2  N52 . We will always assume that this is the case. The holographic entanglement

entropy for Wilson surfaces of arbitrary shape, but with N2  1, is calculated in refs. [5,
245].

To holographically describe Wilson lines in SYM, one must add boundary terms
to the D-brane action which implement a Legendre transformation with respect to
the brane’s position and gauge field [87, 89]. The former is needed because a string
describing a Wilson line obeys complementary boundary conditions to a string ending
on a D-brane. The latter fixes the total amount of fundamental string charge dissolved
in the brane, and thus the representation of the Wilson line.
For M2- and M5-branes, we will use an analogous boundary term,

where σ are coordinates on ∂Σ, the intersection of the brane with the boundary of

transformation with respect to the position r of the end of the brane at infinity. There
is no need to Legendre transform with respect to the gauge field, as the dissolved
M2-brane charge is already fixed by the flux quantization condition (6.13).

6.3.2

Entanglement entropy and probe branes

In order to compute the defect contribution to entanglement entropy, we will use the
methods of refs. [111, 114, 118, 119], reviewed in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, which allow
the leading order contribution in the probe limit to be obtained without any knowledge

then given by (3.31) and (3.32), respectively.
When the brane embedding breaks conformal symmetry, it is no longer possible to

perform the conformal transformation to hyperbolic space. However, the bulk coordinate change to hyperbolic slicing, without changing the defining function, remains a
convenient way of computing generalised gravitational entropy (3.36) [111, 119].
A subtlety that affects the results of section 6.6 comes from the six-form gauge field.
In hyperbolic slicing, its field strength is given at all temperatures by
F7 = 6(2L)6 v 5 sinh4 u sin3 φ0 sin2 φ1 sin φ2 dτ ∧ dv ∧ du ∧ dφ0 ∧ dφ1 ∧ dφ2 ∧ dφ3 . (6.18)
We consider M5-brane embeddings with boundaries. The on-shell action of such an
M5-brane may change by boundary terms under gauge transformations of C6 [89].
The consequence for us is that the entanglement entropy for solutions presented in
section 6.6 will depend on the choice of gauge for C6 in the hyperbolic slicing,6 so we
must be careful to choose the appropriate gauge. The same phenomenon occurs in
5
We put the metric (6.16) in Euclidean signature by a Wick rotation τ → iτ̃ . We will abuse notation
slightly by dropping the tilde on the Euclidean time coordinate.
6
It is plausible that there exists some boundary term which cancels the gauge dependence, but the
form of this boundary term is not known to us.

Note that this gauge is not the result of performing the coordinate transformation (6.15)
on the flat slicing gauge potential (6.9b). In section 6.6, we confirm that with this gauge
choice we obtain the same result for the entanglement entropy of a symmetric representation Wilson surface as that computed in ref. [5, 245] using the Ryu-Takayanagi
prescription in the fully back-reacted geometry. The latter calculation is independent
of the choice of gauge for C6 , so this agreement supports (6.19) as the correct gauge.

6.4

Single M2-brane

In this section, we compute the entanglement entropy contribution from a single M2brane, believed to be holographically dual to a Wilson surface operator in the fundamental representation. We begin by reviewing the embedding of the M2-brane in flat
slicing [242].
The M2-brane is described by the action (6.11). We choose static gauge, parameterising the brane by ξ = (t, x, z), and take as an ansatz ρ = ρ(z), with boundary
condition limz→0 ρ = 0. The pullback of C3 (6.9a) onto the brane vanishes with this
ansatz, and the action reduces to

As a check of our results, we compare the expression (6.31) for c to that obtained
from the Weyl anomaly (6.6). The holographic Weyl anomaly for a fundamental representation Wilson surface was calculated in ref. [44]. In our notation, their result is

M5-branes wrapping S3 ⊂ S4

In this section we will seek solutions wrapping an S3 internal to the S4 factor of the
background geometry. When the world volume of the brane takes the form AdS3 ×

S3 , such a solution is expected to be dual to a Wilson surface in an antisymmetric
representation [242], corresponding to a Young tableau consisting of a single column.
The number of boxes N2 in the tableau is equal to the amount of M2-brane charge
dissolved in the M5-brane, determined from the flux quantization condition (6.13).

6.5.1

The solution in flat slicing

Let us parameterise the brane by ξ = (t, x, z, χ1 , χ2 , χ3 ), gauge fix the auxiliary scalar
field to a = z, and employ an ansatz
θ = θ(z),

F3 =

4L3 N2

N5

(6.34)

with ρ = 0. One can verify that this ansatz satisfies the equations of motion for the
gauge field. Substituting the ansatz and integrating over χ1,2,3 , the PST action (6.12)
becomes

which ensures that the brane embedding preserves one quarter of the supersymmetries
of the background solution.
The BPS condition (6.38) possesses two classes of solutions with constant θ. One
class is the antisymmetric Wilson surface [242–244], corresponding to a representation
of su(N5 ) with a Young tableau consisting of N2 boxes. For these solutions,
cos θ = 1 − 2N2 /N5 .

(6.39)

The other class of solution sits at either the north or south pole of the S4 , θ = 0 or π,
with arbitrary N2 . The wrapped S3 therefore collapses to zero size and this solution
corresponds to a bundle of N5 M2-branes [259].
To obtain solutions where θ depends non-trivially on z, we integrate the BPS condition (6.38) to obtain

(a): In the AdS7 factor of the geometry, the brane (the thick blue line) spans the
directions (t, x, z) (the t and x directions are suppressed in this figure) and occupies
ρ = 0. The thin, horizontal, black line in this figure is the boundary of AdS7 . (b): In
the UV (z → 0) the M5-brane collapses to the south pole of the S4 . For non-zero z,
the M5-brane wraps an S3 at a polar angle θ(z) which decreases with increasing z.
In the IR (z → ∞) this angle tends to a value (6.39), determined by the dissolved
M2-brane charge. The UV and IR solutions correspond to a bundle of M2-branes and
the antisymmetric Wilson surface, respectively.

the antisymmetric Wilson surface. The solution therefore describes an RG flow from
the bundle of M2-branes to the antisymmetric Wilson surface, which we will refer to
as the antisymmetric flow. We sketch this embedding in figure 6.2. Expanding θ(z) for
small z and using (2.19), we find that that θ is dual to an operator with ∆ = 2, and
that the flow is driven by a non-zero VEV for this operator.
The antisymmetric flow only exists for N2 < N5 . One way to see this is to rearrange
the solution (6.40) into the form
2m4 z 4 =

sin2 θ
.
1 − cos θ − 2N2 /N5

(6.41)

The left-hand side is manifestly positive, while the right hand side is negative for all θ
unless N2 ≤ N5 . If N2 = N5 , then the solution reduces to the bundle of M2-branes.

Noting that the integration over z in (6.42) has limits [, ∞), and that the contents

of the square brackets vanish in the limit z → ∞, we see that the bulk and boundary

contributions cancel. Hence the contribution of the brane to the on-shell action vanishes
in flat slicing.
The Weyl anomaly coefficients of the defect dual to the bundle of M2-branes are
given by (N5 −N2 ) times those for the fundamental representation Wilson surface (6.32),
b = d1 = d2 = 12N5 (N5 − N2 ).

(6.44)

For the antisymmetric representation Wilson surface, two of the Weyl anomaly coefficients, b and d2 , were calculated holographically in ref. [6],
b = d2 = 12N2 (N5 − N2 ).

(6.45)

Since the antisymmetric flow only exists for N5 > N2 , we find that both b and d2 are
larger in the UV than in the IR.

6.5.2

Entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric Wilson surface

In this section we compute the entanglement entropy contribution from the M5-brane
embedding with constant θ = cos−1 (1 − 2N2 /N5 ), the antisymmetric Wilson surface.
In hyperbolic slicing, the solution at inverse temperature β0 = 2π may be obtained
by a coordinate transformation from flat space. It spans (τ, v, u) and satisfies sin φ0 = 0.
It is straightforward to verify that this is still a solution for arbitrary temperatures in
the hyperbolic slicing.
Substituting this solution into the PST action, and Wick rotating to Euclidean
signature, we find the bulk contribution to the Euclidean on-shell action to be

charge (6.31) of a single M2-brane for N2  N5 . The entanglement entropy (6.52) and

Weyl anomaly coefficients (6.44) satisfy the relation (6.6).

Entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric flow solution

In hyperbolic slicing, we parameterise the brane by (τ, v, u, χ1 , χ2 , χ3 ), and gauge fix
the auxiliary scalar field to be given by a = v. The embedding will be specified by the
function θ = θ(τ, v, u). As before, the gauge field strength is determined by the flux

Since the antisymmetric flow only exists for N2 ≤ N5 , the central charge is mani-

festly larger in the UV than in the IR,

cUV ≥ cIR .

(6.60)

This would appear to support the interpretation of c as a measure of the massless
degrees of freedom on the brane. However, in section 6.6 we will see that for M5-brane
flow solutions wrapping an S3 internal to AdS7 instead of S4 , the inequality (6.60) does
not hold.

6.5.4

On-shell action

It has been argued [247] that for defect RG flows the free energy on a sphere or in
hyperbolic space serves as a better candidate to count degrees of freedom than the
entanglement entropy. For the bundle of M2-branes in hyperbolic slicing, the free energy
is (N5 − N2 ) times that of a single M2-brane, given in (6.27), while the free energy of

the antisymmetric Wilson surface was computed in (6.48). Setting β = β0 = 2π, we

for the bundle of M2-branes,
(6.61)
for the antisymmetric Wilson surface.

Since these flows only exist for N2 ≤ N5 , we find that −F (1) is indeed larger in the UV

than the IR, consistent with the expectations of ref. [247].

However, since the antisymmetric flow is triggered by a VEV rather than a source,
the flow and the bundle of M2-branes describe two different states of the same theory.
As pointed out in ref. [247], the difference between the hyperbolic space free energies
of the IR and UV solutions is equal to the relative entropy of the two states, and is
guaranteed to be positive due to positivity of relative entropy [135].
A candidate quantity which we can study along the entire flow is provided by
ref. [120], in which the contribution of probe D-brane solutions to the on-shell action
in the entanglement wedge was observed to decrease monotonically along a defect RG
flow. We will now test whether the same is true for the antisymmetric M5-brane flow.

M5-branes wrapping S3 ⊂ AdS7

In this section we will seek solutions wrapping an S3 internal to the AdS7 factor of the
background geometry. This includes the symmetric representation Wilson surface [242],
corresponding to a Young tableau consisting of a single row of N2 boxes, with N2
127

determined from (6.13). We will also study flows from the symmetric representation
Wilson surface to a bundle of M2-branes.

6.6.1

The solution in flat slicing

We begin by working in a supergravity background of the form,
ds2 = h(r)−1/3 ηµν dxµ dxν + h(r)2/3 dr2 + r2 ds2S4



F4 = r4 h0 (r)dsS4 ,

(6.66)

where ηµν is the six-dimensional Minkowski metric, and for now we leave the function
h(r) arbitrary. If h(r) = 1 + L3 /r3 , the background is the M5-brane solution (2.10).
If h(r) = L3 /r3 the background is AdS7 × S4 . We employ static gauge on the probe

M5-brane, ξ = (x0 , x1 , xα ), where α runs from 2 to 5. With the following ansatz for
the world volume fields
r = r(xα ),

F3,αβγ = αβγδ δ δ η (xα ),

a = a(x1 ),

(6.67)

Such solutions are well known in flat space, they describe an M5-brane at r = r0 ,

The solution (6.69), derived in ref. [261], is the generalisation for a probe M5-brane

Let us take take the AdS7 × S4 background, so that h(r) = L3 /r3 , and consider the

As for the antisymmetric flow solution, this is completely cancelled by the boundary

where the radius of the AdS3 is 2L 1 + N2 /2N5 and the radius of the S3 is L 2N2 /N5 .
The presence of the AdS3 indicates that the defect preserves the global subgroup of
two-dimensional conformal symmetry. Indeed, the solution with m̃ = 0 is expected to
be holographically dual to a Wilson surface in a symmetric representation [242–244].10 .
When m̃ 6= 0 the M5-brane world volume no longer includes an AdS3 factor, so

the defect conformal symmetry is broken. Near the boundary, where |m̃|z 2  1, the

solution approaches the Wilson surface solution. For m̃ < 0, ρ(z) becomes infinite at

z = |m̃|−1/2 , probed by an infinite tension self-dual string. We will refer to this as the

M5-brane funnel.

For m̃ > 0, ρ(z) remains finite for all z. In the infrared, m̃z 2  1 the world volume

again has an AdS3 factor but with radius 2L, indicating that the solution with positive

where the dots indicate corrections of higher order in m̃z 2 . The proper radius of the
S3 shrinks to zero as z → ∞, and a natural guess is that the infrared is a bundle of

M2-branes. Similar D3-brane solutions in AdS5 × S5 , flowing from a symmetric repre-

sentation Wilson surface to a bundle of strings, were studied in [120, 263]. Expanding
the solution (6.71) for small z, we find that as in the case of the flow involving the
antisymmetric representation, the flow is triggered by the VEV of an operator with
conformal dimension ∆ = 2.

To support the intuition that the infrared is a bundle of non-interacting M2-branes,
let us carry out a calculation in the style of section 2.4 of [264]. Substituting the field
strength (6.72) into the M5-brane action, along with the ansatz ρ = ρ(z), we obtain

This is N2 times the action (6.20) for a single M2-brane, as expected. Note that in the

to the gauge field to fix the total amount of fundamental string charge dissolved in the
brane. In our case there is no need to Legendre transform, since the M2-brane charge
is already fixed by the flux quantization condition (6.13).

(6.80)

where κ2 ≡ N2 /2N5 . We have not been able to analytically find the generalisation
of this solution for arbitrary temperatures in the hyperbolic slicing. This means we

cannot compute the contribution of the Wilson surface to the Rényi entropies, but we
may still obtain the entanglement entropies by differentiating the off-shell action with
respect to the inverse temperature and using (3.36).
To write the off-shell action, we parameterise the brane by ξ = (τ, v, u, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 )
and take as an ansatz Φ = Φ(τ, v, u). Substituting this into the PST action and
integrating over the S3 parameterised by (φ1 , φ2 , φ3 ), we obtain

Discussion

We have computed the contribution to entanglement entropy from a number of defects
in N = (2, 0) SCFT, holographically dual to probe M-theory branes, for a spherical

entangling region centred on the defect. Some of these defects were Wilson surfaces,
and for these the entanglement entropy reproduces the probe limit of the results of [5].
The contribution of a two-dimensional conformal defect to the entanglement entropy
of a spherical subregion takes the same form as the entanglement entropy of a single
interval in a two-dimensional CFT, and in particular is logarithmically divergent in the
UV. It is therefore tempting to identify the coefficient c of the logarithm as a central
charge measuring degrees of freedom on the defect. Moreover the function C(`) defined
in (6.4) provides a natural quantity that interpolates between the central charges of
the fixed points of a defect RG flow.
However, the M5-brane embeddings we have studied show that C(`) is not necessarily monotonic along RG flows, and in particular c can be larger in the IR than
in the UV. This suggests that the central charge as defined from the entanglement
entropy may not provide a measure of the number of massless degrees of freedom on
the defect. On the other hand, two of the coefficients of the defect’s contribution to
the Weyl anomaly, b and d2 , decreased along all of the RG flows that we studied. A
monotonicity theorem for b has already been proven [47]. It would be be interesting to
attempt the proof of a similar theorem for d2 , or alternatively to find examples of flows
where d2 increases, in order to test whether d2 may also count degrees of freedom.
An alternative quantity, the on-shell action inside the entanglement wedge, decreases monotonically along the flows we study, as well as similar flows involving Dbranes dual to one-dimensional defects in N = 4 SYM [120]. This provides another

candidate C-function. It would be interesting to test whether it is monotonic in other
holographic examples of RG flows, and to understand what this quantity corresponds
to in the dual field theory.

There are several possible directions for future work. For example, we have studied
planar defects, and a natural generalisation would be to study the entanglement entropy
of defects with more complicated geometries. One example is the spherical Wilson
surface, which may be obtained from the planar surface by a conformal transformation
[243]. One could also study different geometries for the entangling region. It is plausible
that the entanglement entropy for differently shaped defects or entangling regions may
be sensitive to the third Weyl anomaly coefficient d1 [265]. It would also be interesting
to study defects in holographic examples of six-dimensional SCFTs with N = (1, 0)

supersymmetry [266, 267].

The techniques used in this chapter could also be applied to higher dimensional
defects. For example, N = (2, 0) theory admits four-dimensional defects [268, 269],
corresponding to intersecting M5-branes. The entanglement entropy of a spherical
region is likely to be sensitive to a linear combination of Weyl anomaly coefficients,
138

similar to (6.6), although the general form of the Weyl anomaly for higher dimensional
defects is not known. In addition, computation of entanglement entropy and Weyl
anomaly coefficients for holographic examples of defect RG flows could provide evidence
for monotonicity theorems for higher-dimensional defects.

Concluding remarks
We have used gauge/gravity duality to investigate a variety of phenomena in strongly
coupled quantum field theories. We close with a summary of our results, and some
speculation for the future.
In chapter 4, we computed entanglement density in a variety of holographic models.
Many of these models exhibit area theorem violation when they approach regimes with
different scaling symmetry in the IR than the UV. This potentially indicates that there
is an enhanced number of low-energy degrees of freedom in such regimes. If this can
be made precise, entanglement density may be a useful tool to probe the low-energy
effective descriptions of physical systems.
Following this, in chapter 5 we studied the spectrum of excitations in a holographic
model of compressible quantum matter. As in similar models, the spectrum included
a low temperature mode with sound-like dispersion — holographic zero sound. The
attenuation of holographic zero sound in this model is well described by hydrodynamics.
Similar behavior has been observed for other modes and in other holographic models
of compressible quantum matter [205, 226, 227]. Whether this property is special to
holographic systems or is more general remains to be seen.
Only relatively recently has the density response of a cuprate been measured [270].
These initial results show no evidence for zero sound. If this finding is strengthened
by further experiments, then this poses a challenge: how do we explain this using
holography? Alternatively, if future experiments do find a zero sound mode, then its
properties will be a valuable input for holographic models. In either case, we hope
that understanding the necessary modifications to the holographic models discussed in
chapter 5 will provide lessons about real non-Fermi liquids.
In chapter 6 we used gauge/gravity duality to study properties of two-dimensional
supersymmetric defects in the N = (2, 0) theory. We found that the entanglement

entropy for spherical subregions is not monotonic along RG flows, making it a poor
candidate to measure degrees of freedom on the defect. On the other hand, two coefficients appearing in the defect contribution to the Weyl anomaly, b and d2 , decreased
along all of the flows that we studied. One of these coefficients, b, satisfies a mono141

tonicity theorem [47]. It is currently unknown whether the same is true for d2 .
The status of monotonicity theorems and the counting of degrees of freedom on
higher dimensional defects is less clear, although some conjectures have been made [247,
271, 272].1 It is likely that gauge/gravity duality will play a role in future attempts to
prove new monotonicity theorems. For example, explicit holographic models of defect
RG flows may suggest candidate C-functions to target. It may also be easier to prove
new monotonicity theorems first in holography. For example, the F -theorem was proved
holographically before it was proved in general [273].
More than twenty years after the original AdS/CFT proposal, gauge/gravity duality
remains an active field of research, with many applications beyond those discussed in
this thesis. For instance, holography provides a toolbox for building models of QCD at
finite density, with applications to heavy ion collisions and neutron star physics.
A particularly interesting outcome of holography is the connection it has revealed
between the structure of spacetime and quantum information theory. For example,
locality in the bulk of aAdS may be understood as arising from quantum error correction
in the dual QFT [274].2 In the future, quantum information approaches will hopefully
shed further light on spacetime in quantum gravity in aAdS, such as the nature of the
interior of black holes.
More generally, gauge/gravity duality has proved a useful tool for understanding
QFT and quantum gravity. We hope that it will continue to provide insight and
surprises in the years to come.

A.1.1

Entanglement density for large spheres
Matching expansions

In this appendix we compute the large-` behaviour of the holographic entanglement
density for the sphere geometry in spacetimes of the form (4.5), with a horizon at
z = zH . The large ` limit is slightly more complicated than small `, since in computing
the area of the RT surface we must include both the UV divergent contributions from
small z, and the near horizon contributions which dominate in the entanglement density.
To account for this, we will use the method of matched expansions used in ref. [138].
We assume that near the horizon, the metric function g(z) has the Taylor expansion
g(z) = g1 (zH − z) + g2 (zH − z)2 + . . . ,
with g1 6= 0. It will be useful to define γ ≡

(A.1)

p
(d − 1)g1 /2zH . We divide the RT surface

into two regimes, a near-horizon region where z ≈ zH , and a large-r region where r ≈ `.

For large `, the RT surface typically drops rapidly from the boundary to the horizon
at r ≈ `, almost lying flat on the horizon for r < `. Hence, as sketched in figure A.1,

for `  zH the near-horizon and large-r regions overlap. We will find approximate
solutions for the embedding of the RT surface in these two regions, and match them in
the overlap.
In the near-horizon region, we parameterise the RT surface by the boundary spherical polar coordinates (r, θi ), so that the surface is specified by z(r). By symmetry, the
maximal extent z∗ of the RT surface into the bulk occurs at r = 0, z(0) = z∗ . Requiring
the surface to be smooth at this point implies that z 0 (0) = 0.

Let us write the maximal extent of the RT surface into the bulk as z∗ = zH (1 − δ),

where δ  1. The precise value of δ will be determined by matching to the large r

expansion. We make the ansatz z(r) ≈ z∗ − δz1 (r) + O(δ 2 ). The boundary conditions
on z(r) imply z1 (0) = z10 (0) = 0. The equation of motion for z1 and the solution which

This will be used in the matching of the two solutions.

In the large-r region, we parameterise the RT surface by (z, θi ), so that its shape is
specified by r(z). Requiring that the RT surface tends to the entangling region at the
boundary sets the condition r(0) = `. We make the ansatz

this to occur, we set a = zH .1 The other integration constant b is to be fixed by the
matching.

a function of sphere radius `, for different values of d. The solid lines are numerical
results, and the dotted lines are the large radius approximation (A.21). The approximation works well for sufficiently large T `, where T is the temperature.

We compare the approximation (A.21) to numerical results for the entanglement density
in AdSd+1 -Schwarzschild in figure A.2, finding good agreement at sufficiently large
sphere radii.

Monotonicity of C(zH ) for AdS-Schwarzschild

In this section we wish to show that the coefficient C(zH ), defined in (4.26), increases
monotonically with d for AdSd+1 -Schwarzschild.

Large-width entanglement entropy for hyperscalingviolating geometries with θ = d − 2

In this appendix we derive the logarithmic violation of the area law (4.59), for the strip
entanglement entropy for the models of section 4.6 with θ = d − 2.
Recall that the width of the strip is related to the maximal extension z∗ of the RT

surface into the bulk by (4.12). For large ` (and hence large z∗ ), the integral in (4.12) is

dominated by contributions coming from large z. From the asymptotic scalings (4.53),
for θ = d − 2 we find that the metric function g(z) has the large-z expansion
g(z) =



where µ is the chemical potential, and γ is a numerical constant, determined from
the solution to the equations of motion. Substituting the metric expansion (A.27)
into (4.12), we find

2µd−2 z∗d−1 
`= √

(A.28)

To obtain a large-` approximation to the entanglement density (A.27), we need to
find an approximate expression for C(z∗ ), and then replace all factors of z∗ using (A.28).

One subtlety is that the integral appearing in (4.26) receives significant contributions
from near the boundary, not just from large z, due to the factor of 1/ud−1 . To make
progress, we rewrite C(z∗ ) as

Numerical methods

In this appendix we discuss technical details of our holographic calculations of the
retarded Green’s functions, their poles, and the spectral functions. We use the shooting
method developed in ref. [84].
The poles in the Green’s functions are holographically dual to the quasinormal
modes of the black brane solution (5.11), which we determine numerically as follows. For a given ω and k, we form two independent solutions to the equations of
motion (5.24), which we label Za,I , where a ∈ {1, 2} labels the fluctuations defined

in (5.23), while I ∈ {1, 2} labels the independent solutions. The solutions are con155

structed by integrating the equations of motion (5.24) from the horizon, with boundary
conditions cout
a = 0 for all a and I, and
in

1 = c2 = 1,

I = 1,

out
cin
1 = −c2 = 1,

I = 2.

(B.10)

Since the equations of motion (5.24) are linear, any solution obeying ingoing boundary
conditions may be written as a linear superposition of the Za,I .
We now construct a matrix from the solutions,
ZaI (z) =

Z1,1 (z) Z1,2 (z)

!

Z2,1 (z) Z2,2 (z)

(B.11)

In the limit z → 0, the elements of this matrix reduce to the boundary values, Za,I as
defined in (5.25),

(B.12)

The determinant of (B.12) vanishes when there exists a linear combination of the
solutions which is normalisable at the boundary. The quasinormal modes are defined as
the frequencies for which such a solution exists, so we determine the quasinormal modes
for a given k by numerically searching for the values of ω for which the determinant
of (B.12) vanishes.
The Green’s functions are determined from the on-shell action for the fluctuations,
obtained by expanding (5.10) up to quadratic order in the fluctuations. Writing the
on-shell action as

where the ellipsis denotes terms containing at most one derivative with respect to z,
as well as counterterms from holographic renormalisation. These terms are cumbersome, and cannot be written purely in terms of the gauge invariant variables Za . The

The retarded Green’s functions for the sound-channel components of J µ and T µν
may be obtained from (B.16), as well as the relationship (5.23) between the gauge

where Za,I is the O(z n ) term in the near-boundary expansion of Za , with horizon

to the ellipsis in (B.13). The contact terms are analytic in ω, so do not affect the
poles of the Green’s functions, and real [189, 196], so do not contribute to the spectral
functions (5.27).

The combination Z1,1 Z2,2 − Z1,2 Z2,1 , appearing in the denominators of (B.17), is

precisely the determinant of (B.12). This is an explicit example of the fact that the
quasinormal modes are the poles of the Green’s functions.2 Near a given pole, which
we label as ω∗ (k), the Green’s functions take the form
Gab (ω, k) ≈

Rab (k)

Ref. [84] provides a formula for numerically computing the residue,

ω∗ (k)

We note that F is independent of the choice of boundary conditions (B.10). To see this, note that
if we choose a new pair of independent boundary conditions at the horizon, the resulting solutions for
Z1,2 may be expressed as a linear combination of the solutions with boundary conditions (B.10), by
linearity of the equations of motion. In terms of the matrix (B.11), the change in boundary conditions
therefore amounts to replacing Z with ZM , for some constant matrix M . The combination Z(z)Z−1 ()
is manifestly invariant under this replacement.
2
The apparent pole at ω = k in (B.17) is spurious [189], and is compensated by a zero in the
numerators.

157

The reason why this works is that by construction det [Z(0)] vanishes at ω = ω∗ ,

so we can Taylor expand to find

det[Z()]
∂ω det[Z()]

≈ (ω − ω∗ ) (where we assume that the

zero of det [Z(0)] is first order). Hence, the right-hand side of (B.19) is equivalent to
limω→ω∗ (ω − ω∗ )Gab (ω, k), which is manifestly the residue Rab . The form (B.19) is

more convenient for numerical computation, since it doesn’t require a priori knowledge
of the quasinormal mode frequency ω∗ .

Entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric flow

In Euclidean signature, the image of the inverse of the map (6.15) is all of local AdS,
rather than the region x20 + x2 + ρ2 + z 2 ≤ `2 as is the case in Lorentzian signature.

The integration region in the bulk contribution (C.4b) is therefore the entirety of local
AdS, with the cutoff region at z <  excised.
The derivatives of z with respect to hyperbolic slicing coordinates may be written
as
