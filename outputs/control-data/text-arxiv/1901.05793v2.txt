We review different matrix product states (MPS) approaches to study the spreading of operators
in generic nonintegrable quantum systems. As a common ground to all methods, we quantify
this spreading by means of the Frobenius norm of the commutator of a spreading operator with a
local operator, which is usually referred to as the out-of-time-order correlation (OTOC) function.
We compare two approaches based on matrix-product states in the Schrödinger picture: the time
dependent block decimation (TEBD) and the time dependent variational principle (TDVP), as well
as TEBD based on matrix-product operators directly in the Heisenberg picture. The results of all
methods are compared to numerically exact results using Krylov space exact time evolution. We find
that for the Schrödinger picture the TDVP algorithm performs better than the TEBD algorithm.
Moreover the tails of the OTOC are accurately obtained both by TDVP MPS and TEBD MPO.
They are in very good agreement with exact results at short times, and appear to be converged
in bond dimension even at longer times. However the growth and saturation regimes are not well
captured by neither of the methods.

INTRODUCTION

The question of quantum thermalization in closed systems receives currently a considerable amount of attention. This interest is partly due to the importance of
this problem for the understanding of the foundations of
statistical physics [1–5] and to the experimental progress
leading to increasingly well isolated experimental realizations of quantum many-body systems in ultracold atomic
gases in optical lattices [6]. In general, the unitary dynamics of isolated quantum systems precludes reaching
a maximally mixed state if the system is initialized in
a pure state. Nevertheless, generic isolated quantum
many-body systems typically are found to reach a thermal state, i.e. local observables assume values consistent with the micro-canonical ensemble at long times[7].
Considering only a small subsystem of the total system,
the usual notion of thermodynamic equilibrium is recovered, as the reduced density matrix becomes equal to the
corresponding thermodynamic density matrix [8, 9], as
the rest of the system serves as a heat bath. This behavior is rooted in the local structure of eigenstates of
the many body Hamiltonian which manifests itself in the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [1–5], motivated by random matrix theory considerations. It provides a precise prediction for the matrix form of local
operators in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian, and implies thermalization[3, 10, 11]. The mechanism for this
thermalization process is the loss of local quantum information over time, which implies that the full wave
function of the initial state cannot be reconstructed from
local measurements at long times [12]. In consequence of
this loss of local information, the system becomes increasingly entangled, until the state of a subsystem reaches a

maximally mixed state consistent with global constraints
[7, 13, 14]. A direct local probe of the loss of local
quantum information can be constructed by studying the
spreading of initially local Heisenberg operators Ôi (t)
which become increasingly nonlocal over the course of
time. The locality can be quantified by probing the real
space support of Ôi (t) using the norm of the commutator with another local operator V̂j . This quantity is now
best known as the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC)
which was introduced to study quantum chaos [15, 16],
and to bound the spreading of information in systems
with short ranged interactions [17].
Certain universal properties of the OTOC can be well
understood in random unitary circuits [18–21] where it
is governed by hydrodynamic equations of motion. In
these systems, a light cone structure was identified with
a broadening front arising from the diffusive nature of
the hydrodynamic equations. This diffusive behaviour
has been found in numerically exact calculations in a
noisy spin system [22]. However, no exponential regime
with a fixed Lyapunov exponent was found so far in such
systems, nor in Hamiltonian systems with a small local
Hilbert space and continuous time[23].
While the OTOC is a powerful and universal theoretical tool, it is very difficult to calculate in practice for
generic quantum many-body systems, due to its operator nature (see paragraph III A). In the last two years
several numerical methods for calculating the OTOC
emerged: exact operator evolution in the Heisenberg picture [24], matrix product operators (MPO) evolution in
the Heisenberg picture [25, 26] and an exact wave function technique in the Schrödinger picture [23]. In this
article, we will carefully compare these techniques and
add two more MPS methods based on a stochastic sampling of the OTOC in the Schrödinger picture using both
time evolving block decimation (TEBD) [27] and the
time dependent variational principle (TDVP) using ma-

2
trix product states (MPS) [28, 29], which is currently
discussed as a candidate method to extract late time
hydrodynamic properties of quantum systems [30, 31].
While exact Schrödinger evolution using quantum typicality is currently the best choice to obtain the exact
OTOC for Hilbert space dimensions of up to 109 even
at late times [23], MPS techniques have been recently
presented as complementary approaches. In particular,
MPO time evolution using TEBD can be used to extract the tails of the OTOC at very long distances (see
paragraph III A). Here, we investigate, how MPS based
time evolution techniques such as TEBD and TDVP in
the Schrödinger picture compare to the method of MPO
evolution.
This article is structured as follows: in section II we
review the different MPS methods that we used to simulate quantum dynamics. In section III, we present different ways of quantifying the spreading of operators in
non-integrable systems, and the numerical approaches we
choose to simulate them. Next, in section IV we compare
the results obtained by the different methods, both for
small and larger systems, and assess to which extent our
results can be trusted despite the low amount of entanglement included in our MPS approximations.
II. MATRIX PRODUCT STATES METHODS
FOR THE SIMULATION OF QUANTUM TIME
EVOLUTION

While the MPS formalism originally arose in the context of ground state physics, it has also been very successful in the description of quantum dynamics of one dimensional quantum systems [32]. Every quantum many
body state can be brought into a MPS form, that is:

Time evolving block decimation

The TEBD algorithm [27, 32] is a powerful and simple tool to simulate the short time dynamics of onedimensional systems with short range interactions. It is
applicable to both the Schrödinger and Heisenberg picture.
The key idea of the algorithm is to employ a Trotter
decomposition of the time evolution operator in such a
way that only local time evolution operators occur. For
example a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian is written as a
sum over terms which involve only two neighboring sites:

Ai is the tensor at site i of the MPS corresponding to the
state that we wish to evolve, Hij denotes the gates of the
Hamiltonian between sites i and j and dt is the time step;
b) Heisenberg representation, where Oi is the tensor at site
i of the MPO corresponding to the operator that we wish to
evolve.

P
Ĥ = i hi,i+1 where hi,i+1 is the part of Ĥ containing
the interaction between sites i and i + 1. Since only nearest neighbor terms do not commute, we decompose the
Hamiltonian into a part acting on the even bonds and
a part acting onQthe odd bonds as Ĥ = Q
Heven + Hodd
where Heven = j h2j,2j+1 and Hodd = j h2j+1,2j+2 .
In this way all the terms contained in Heven (resp. Hodd )
commute with each other. We can now apply a Trotter decomposition at first order for simplicity, although
the implementation of any order is possible within this
scheme. We obtain for the time evolution operator:
U (dt) = e−i(Hodd +Heven )dt
≈ e−iHodd dt e−iHeven dt + O(dt2 )

depends on the amount of bipartite entanglement contained in |ψi. In this section, we review different MPS
based method to perform quantum time evolution.

Each term of the products in the third line of equation
(2) can be written as a unitary gate linking two adjacent
sites. In order to evolve an MPS with a time step dt
we apply a layer of gates as shown in Fig. 1. It is then
possible to re-express the time evolved state as an MPS
of higher bond-dimension.
After each application of a unitary gate, the MPS is optimized using the Schmidt decomposition. This is done
efficiently by writing the state in a Schmidt basis, and
truncating the smallest Schmidt values, whose contributions to the wave-function are least important. This approximation is only valid in a regime where the state is
lowly entangled, limiting the use of the method to short
times for ergodic systems such as the ones we are studying in this work. Moreover the truncation process renders
the time-evolution non unitary and does not preserve the
norm of the state, the energy and other conserved quantities.
The TEBD algorithm is straightforwardly extended to
the MPO-time evolution as illustrated on Fig. 1b, by
noting that in contrast with the MPS case the (adjoint)

3
unitary time evolution must be applied on the lower and
upper legs of the MPO.
All the results obtained with the TEBD algorithm presented in this article were performed with a second order
Trotter decomposition scheme.
B.

The time dependent variational principle using
matrix-product states

The time dependent variational principle (TDVP) was
first introduced by Dirac [33] for a general variational
manifold. The general idea is to project the Schrödinger
equation on the variational manifold of interest in such
a way that the wave function after an infinitesimal time
step does not leave the manifold, yielding an approximate
tractable time evolution.
It has been recently formulated using MPS with a fixed
bond dimension as the variational manifold [28, 29] and
is based on the concept of the tangent space of the MPS
manifold [34]. The algorithm is very similar to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [35, 36] and
offers several advantages with respect to the TEBD algorithm since it does not rely on truncation to keep the
wave function in the manifold MMPS,χ of MPS with
a given dimension χ. Moreover it is suitable to simulate Hamiltonians with long range interactions. To derive the TDVP algorithm, we again start from an MPS
wave function Eq. (1) as a variational ansatz. However, we make every tensor explicitly time dependent,
i.e. A[i]si → A[i]si (t).
After inserting this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation, we find:
X
Ȧ[i]si (t)∂A[i]si |ψ({A[k]sk (t)}i = −iPT H|ψ({A[k]sk (t)})i.
i

(3)
where PT is the projector on the tangent plane of
|ψ({A[k]sk (t)})i. This projection is necessary to ensure
that we obtain closed equations of motion in the tangent space so that the time evolved MPS is confined to
MMPS,χ . The new equations of motion obtained this
way can be elegantly integrated by means of a splitting
method. For more details, we refer to ref. [29].
Unlike the TEBD algorithm, the TDVP algorithm conserves energy even when the exact time evolution cannot be captured by the MPS. Moreover all the conserved
quantities, which do not cause an increase of bond dimension once applied to a MPS, are respected. In other
words, a quantity Ô commuting with the Hamiltonian is
conserved by TDVP if for all states |φi expressible as a
MPS of bond dimension χ we can still express Ô|φi as
a MPS of bond dimension χ. In the case where all conserved quantities leave the manifold MMPS,χ invariant,
TDVP appears well suited for the simulation of thermalization, since it is believed that at long times the dynamics of the system is driven by hydrodynamical equations of motion governed by conserved quantities [37–39].
Following this line of thought, TDVP has recently been
applied successfully in the context of thermalization [30].

However the accuracy of results at long times is currently
under debate [31]. It has also been used advantageously
in disordered systems [40]. In this work, we focus on short
to intermediate times and will not consider the question
of the relevance of TDVP in the context of hydrodymamics. However the TDVP algorithm provides a unitary
time evolution. This feature will be of crucial importance when calculating OTOCs, as explained in section
III A.

MEASURES OF OPERATORS SPREADING
IN CLOSED QUANTUM SYSTEMS: THE
OUT-OF-TIME-ORDER CORRELATOR
A.

Definition

In ergodic isolated quantum systems, local operators in
the Heisenberg picture typically spread over the course
of time in a sense that their supports in real space grows.
Here we study this spreading in a non-integrable spin1
2 chain of length L. In this case, the growth of the
support means that the expansion of an operator V̂i (t) in
the operator basis of strings of local Pauli operators σ̂i ,
i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} (σ̂0 = 1̂):
V̂i (t) =

X

vα1 ,...,αL σ̂α1 ⊗ σ̂α2 ⊗· · ·⊗ σ̂αL (4)

α1 ...αL ∈{0,1,2,3}

acquires increasingly long strings of non-identity Pauli
operators [18, 20, 21]. The growing complexity stems
from the increasing nonlocality of the time evolution operator Û (t) and is also related to the growth of the operator entanglement entropy [41–43]. In order to define
the latter quantity, it is useful to consider the operator
as a state living in a larger Hilbert space. More precisely,
if we decompose an operator Ô in termsPof the elements
of an orthonormal basis {|φi i} as Ô = ij Oij |φi ih φj |,
we
P can then associate to this operator the state |φÔ i =
ij Oij |φi i ⊗ |φj i. The bipartite entanglement entropy
of |φÔ i is called the operator entanglement entropy (assuming proper normalization). Note that the calculation
of the entanglement of MPOs is identical to the MPS
case: one has to find the singular
P values of the bond i
of interest and as usual S = − j s2j ln(s2j ) where sj are
the singular values and S the entanglement.
The expansion in terms of Pauli string operators in
Eq. (4) is a useful measure of operator spreading but
is computationally impractical due to the arising of an
exponentially large number of terms in the length of the
chain. However, we note that in order to study the loss of
locality of quantum information, the most interesting information is contained in how the length of Pauli strings
grows over time. Therefore, we instead consider commutators of the operator V̂i (t) with nontrivial (α ∈ {x, y, z})
local Pauli operators (i.e. σ̂αi = 1̂⊗· · ·⊗1̂⊗σ̂α ⊗1̂⊗· · ·⊗1̂):


vα σ̂α1 ⊗ σ̂α2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σ̂αL , σ̂αj .
V̂i (t), σ̂αj =
α1 ...αL

(5)
This commutator is zero when the local Pauli operators
σ̂αj on site j are identities for all strings in the expansion
V̂i (t). Generically, when the operator support of V̂i (t)
reaches site j, its expansion in terms of Pauli strings will
contain terms not commuting with σ̂αj . This commutator
is therefore quantifying the operator spreading. However
it is also anh operatori and is therefore usually reduced to
its norm V̂i (t), σ̂αj . For computational simplicity, a
standard choice for the norm is the normalized Frobe2
= N1 TrÂ† Â, leading to the
nius norm given by Â
F

Cij (t) =

(6)

where Z is the dimension of the Hilbert space. We
have chosen the normalization in order to ensure that
Cij (t) → 1 at long times in the case where Ŵj and V̂i
are hermitian operators, which square to identity, such
as Pauli operators.
This quantity was originally proposed by Larkin and
Ovchinniokv [15] in the context of quantum chaos. They
showed that in chaotic systems with a semiclassical limit
this norm of the commutator is connected to a Lyapunov
exponent of the system and therefore effectively quantifies its chaoticity. Using this quantity they discussed a
quantum analogue of classical chaos since in the semiclassical limit it quantifies the sensibility of classical trajectories to their initial conditions for the choice Ŵj = p̂
and V̂i = x̂. This can be understood more intuitively by
observing that the OTOC measures the effect of an initial
perturbation on the value at later times of an operator
located at some distance [16]. On the other hand, recent
numerical studies of quantum systems with a small local
Hilbert space and for 31 sites showed that there is no
regime of exponential growth [23], a discrepancy to the
semiclassical case [44], which has yet to be fully understood.
The link between the OTOC and locality of the
Hamiltonian was made a few years later by Lieb and
Robinson[17]. They realized that information in systems
with short range interactions can only spread within a
light-cone with only exponentially suppressed leaking.
This is most effectively quantified by considering the
spreading of initially local operators V̂i (t) in the Heisenberg picture. More precisely:
lim

t→∞,|i−j|>vt

Cij exp [µ(v)t] = 0,

(7)

for velocities v > vLR , where vLR is called the LiebRobinson velocity. The function µ(v) is now referred to
as velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent [45].
The OTOC has been the subject of a renewed interest
in the past few years due the establishment of a dual-

ity between some strongly correlated systems and blackholes and the proposal of exactly solvable models to illustrate it [46]. Moreover the spreading of operators is
directly connected to the scrambling of local quantum information, since in chaotic systems at long times, initially
local operators lose their locality and become completely
scrambled [16].
B.

Numerical considerations

If we restrict ourselves to hermitean unitary operators,
which square to identity, such as Pauli operators, the
OTOC Cij can be expressed as:
Cij = 1 −



Tr V̂i (t)Ŵj V̂i (t)Ŵj ,
2·Z

(8)

where Z = dim(H) is the dimension of the Hilbert
space (see paragraph III A). The nontrivial part of the
calculation of this quantity consists of determining the
correlation function


Tr V̂i (t)Ŵj V̂i (t)Ŵj ,
(9)
Z
which is exponentially expensive: for a spin- 12 system of
L
L
size L, V̂i (t) is represented by a matrix in C2 ×2 . Direct
exact time evolution of the operator will therefore be very
limited in system size [24].
Alternatively the trace can be stochastically evaluated
with typical, randomly chosen wave functions due to
quantum typicality. Although the time evolution will still
be exponentially expensive, larger system sizes can be
achieved since a state has only 2L components. This has
been achieved using exact Krylov space time evolution
[23, 47–50]. Here, instead of operators, only wave functions are evolved in time by moving to the Schrödinger
picture at the price of performing the time evolution forward and backwards in time, yielding an overall scaling
of the method proportional to t2max . This is so far the
most powerful numerically exact method to simulate the
ergodic dynamics of small to intermediate system sizes
up to arbitrary times and used here as a benchmark. For
details of the method, see Refs. 23 and 47.
Another approach is to use Heisenberg propagation of
a matrix product operator (MPO) representation [25, 26]
of V̂j (t) (see Fig. 1). To calculate Ci,j , one can use equation (8). We first evolve V̂j using the setup of Fig.1b)
with Oj = V̂ and all the other operators Ok , k 6= j set
to identity. This way we obtain an MPO which tensors
we denote as Vjl (t), the index l corresponding to the site
of the tensor. We also write Wi as a MPO (which means
that we place the operator Ŵ on site i and identities operators on every other site). The calculation of the trace
is then performed according to Fig.2. This approach can
seem to be limited to short times due to the linear growth
of the operator entanglement entropy [41] implying the
necessity of an exponentially large bond dimension for an
exact representation of the Heisenberg operator.

FIG. 2. Example of trace calculation with MPOs following
equation (8).

It has been argued recently in Ref. [26] that this
method is able to capture the early growth of the OTOC
even with low bond dimension based on the following
observation: first the spreading of quantum information
is bounded by a light cone, implying that the operator
entanglement of bipartitions with a cut outside of the
light cone is small, thus leading to a small required bond
dimension. Therefore in the Heisenberg picture, only tensors inside the region where the entanglement is high will
be truncated within the TEBD scheme. Finally, it is assumed that the effect of the truncation propagates as
a light cone, meaning that the sites with low entanglement should not be affected immediately by the effect of
a truncation far away from them. In numerical simulations, the convergence of the results with bond-dimension
presented in Ref. [26] seems to support this reasoning.
Our benchmarks for small systems (Fig. 3), our comparison of the contour lines of the OTOC obtained using
MPO evolution to other methods (Fig. 6), as well as our
analysis of the convergence with bond dimension (Fig.
10) also provide further support that MPO time evolution does indeed accurately capture the tail of the OTOC.
We would like to note that this MPO technique has been
applied in the past to calculate operator spreading in the
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in Ref. [25], where
a discrepancy to the ballistic spreading at early times for
small bond dimensions was pointed out, which was attributed to the truncation of the bond dimension.
Here, we propose a scheme based on the Schrödinger
picture to MPS time evolution methods (see section II).
The trace in Eq. (9) is sampled stochastically over random product states |σ1 , . . . σL i, which is reminiscent of
minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) at
infinite temperature[51] (β = 0). Additionally, we have
the freedom to chose the basis such that the basis states
are eigenstates of the operator Ŵj , which we take for
convenience to be Ŵj = σ̂iz :

This way, we only have to propagate one wave function (i.e. |σi) forward in time, apply V̂i , and propagate

back to t = 0 for each initial state |σi. The average is
performed over nstates initial states, which are sampled
uniformly from the local σz product state basis (subject
to sector constraints if required). From now on, we we
will restrict ourselves to the case V̂i (t) = σ̂iz (t).
In order to evaluate equation (10), we use both the
TEBD and the single site TDVP algorithms. In ref. [29],
a two-site implementation of the TDVP algorithm was
proposed. However, in our case, this version of the algorithm would not be suitable for our purposes since it also
relies on truncation to keep the bound dimension of the
MPS fixed, hence yielding a non unitary time evolution
and violating conservation of energy. However the single
site algorithm does not allow to increase dynamically the
bond dimension. In order to address this problem, we
initialize our MPS as follows. First, we fill up the MPS
with zeros in such a way that the product state, initially
of bond dimension one, acquires the desired bond dimension χ. Second, we bring our inflated product state in
canonical (isometric) form following the usual sweeping
procedure [32]. This state is then a proper state and the
single-site TDVP reproduces the correct time evolution.

short range interactions which has both integrable and
non-integrable points as a function of the field angle: the

Comparison of the methods with exact results

In order to explore the domain of validity of the different methods (MPS TDVP, MPS TEBD and MPO
TEBD), we compare the results for the OTOC with exact results obtained by Krylov space based exact time
evolution (ETE) for chains of L = 21 spins.
In Fig. 3, we present a detailed comparison
 for a system of size L = 21 of the OTOC C4,j = 12 k σ̂4z (t), σjz k2F
obtained from the four methods compared in this article.

the exact result for longer times than the OTOC obtained
by TEBD. Similarly to TDVP, the MPO evolution using
TEBD captures very well the regime of low values of the
OTOC. Nevertheless the growth and saturation regime
is not correctly reproduced by any of the methods. With
the Schrödinger approach the OTOC is systematically
overestimated while it saturates to an unphysical value
in the case of the Heisenberg approach.
In order to make these statements more precise, we
investigate the error of the different methods by considering the deviation from the exact result for L = 21.
From Fig. 3, we see that the discrepancy from the exact
result is the largest at long times and long distances, in-

dependently of the choice of the method. Therefore we
illustrate the errors resulting from each of the three methods at the longest spatial distance in our system from
the origin at i = 4 by the distance to the exact result

(t)
stands for the OTOC calculated using either the MPS
based methods with TEBD or TDVP time evolution or
by the direct MPO based approach. We have checked
that similar results are obtained for other distances.
These results are explained as follows. While TEBD in
the Schrödinger picture suffers from the propagation of
truncation errors since the wave function has to be propagated back to t = 0 after a measurement, TDVP profits
from the preservation of unitarity by the method, leading
to a significantly smaller error compared to TEBD MPS.
As for the Heisenberg picture, the low value of operator
entanglement at the front of the OTOC light cone allows
the MPO TEBD approach to capture the low values of
the OTOC as explained in paragraph III B. The systematic underestimation of the OTOC saturation values is
due to finite bond dimensions limiting the captured operator entanglement. We note that similar results have
been obtained in disordered spin chains where it has been
demonstrated that TDVP performs better than TEBD
[52].

Large systems and range of validity of the
approximation

So far, we have presented results for systems small
enough such that we could still compare to numerically
exact results obtained by ETE. In what follows, we investigate the performance of these MPS and MPO methods for larger systems. We present in Fig. 5 the results
for the OTOC C4,j (t) = k σ̂4z (t), σjz k2F as a function of
time t and distance j − 4 for a system of size L = 50 sites

lines and symbols correspond to contour lines obtained from
the numerical solution of the equation C4,j (t) = θ for various

denoted t(θ, j). The errorbars are representing the error coming from the stochastic sampling and are extracted using the
bootstrap method.

with bond dimension χ = 64 for both MPO TEBD and
MPS TDVP. Again, we chose the position of the spreading operator σ̂4z (t) on the left of our chain with open
boundaries instead of on the center, since this allows for
a better resolution of the tails of the right part of the
OTOC as discussed in Ref. [47]. For both methods, the
time step dt has been decreased until convergence, and
we found that a significantly smaller time step for TDVP
of dt = 0.005 was required compared to the MPO TEBD
time step of dt = 0.01, since the splitting methods of
TDVP and TEBD differ. While in TEBD the exponential of the Hamiltonian is decomposed into two-site gates
using a Trotter decomposition, in TDVP the update of
every tensor requires the integration of coupled differential which are solved separately for every site i. In TEBD,
only neighboring terms do not commute, while in TDVP
[i]s
the differential equations involving tensors Akl i (t) at site
[j]s
i depend on the value of the tensors Akl j on all sites j.
Therefore, a larger time step error can be expected in
TDVP due to a more severe approximation in the splitting method.
For this reason, the dependence of the error on the
time step is more important and must be checked carefully. Additionally, the stochastic sampling of the trace
in Eq. (8) does not admit importance sampling and is
therefore costly, practically limiting the bond dimensions
considered here to χ = 64. We evaluate the convergence
in bond dimension of our results for both methods in appendix A. We find that we achieve convergence for low
values of the OTOC, which is consistent with the benchmarks shown in Fig. 3.

different methods used are MPO TEBD, MPS TDVP and
ETE. We fit the ETE data between the sites 4 and 21 with
a power law: f (x) = λ(4 − x)µ with x the distance and the
fitting parameters: a)λ = 0.20, µ = 1.32, b)λ = 0.31, µ =

comes from the same calculation as Fig. 5 (MPS TDVP: bond
dimension χ = 64, time step dt = 0.005, system size L = 50
sites, averaged over 387 random states; MPO TEBD:bond
dimension χ = 128, time step dt = 0.01, system size L = 50
sites). The errorbars are obtained in the same way than in
Fig. 5 a.

Here, we do not consider MPS TEBD results because
of the inferior accuracy of this method already identified
for smaller systems as discussed in the previous section.
The representation of the results in Fig. 5 from the two
methods on the same colorscale illustrates the problem
observed for smaller systems in Fig. 3 that MPO TEBD
(right panel) underestimates the saturation value of the
OTOC, in agreement with recent results of Ref. [52],
while TDVP (left panel) reproduces the correct long time
saturation value close to 1. Next, we consider contour
lines (solid lines in Fig. 5) t(θ, j) of the OTOC obtained
from numerical solutions of the equation C4,j (t) = θ for
various thresholds. For very low thresholds, these contours capture the behavior of the tail of the OTOC, where
both methods yield consistent results even at long times.
At larger thresholds, the obtained contours are strikingly
different: while MPS TDVP yields approximately linear
contour lines, close to a linear light cone, the results obtained with MPO TEBD deviate strongly and yield a
significantly slower information spreading. Due to the
problems identified for MPO TEBD closer to the saturation regime of the OTOC as discussed in IV A, we

8
attribute this behavior to the error caused by the insufficient amount of operator entanglement included in
our MPO approximation. The approximately ballistically spreading information front obtained with our MPS
TDVP approach appears to be a qualitative improvement
in comparison with MPO time evolution where the speed
of information propagation seems to be underestimated.
However, although qualitatively interesting, these results
should not be trusted quantitatively at high thresholds
since they are not converged in bond dimension in this
region of space-time.
The results displayed in Fig. 5 can only be compared qualitatively, therefore we proceed by extracting
the contours t(θ, j) of the OTOC for various values of
the threshold and plot the results from MPS TDVP and
MPO TEBD in the same figure panel for a direct quantitative comparison. In addition to the MPS results for
L = 50 also the exact results for L = 21 are shown
in Fig. 6. This is an important comparison, since results in other systems demonstrate that for short enough
times, the OTOC does essentially not show any finite
size effects [23, 47]. The contours obtained with ETE
and MPS/MPO methods for different system sizes are
therefore expected to coincide for short times and the
contours at low thresholds should not depend on system
size.
For very small thresholds (θ = 10−5 and θ = 10−3 ),
see Figs. 6a and 6b, the contours obtained with MPO
TEBD and MPS TDVP indeed match the exact results,
in accordance with results of Fig. 3, confirming our expectations. However, some differences start to appear at
higher thresholds (θ = 0.1 and θ = 0.2), see Figs. 6a and
6b, which can be expected from our study of convergence
in bond dimension (see appendix A). We note that our
MPS TDVP seems to yield a contour slightly closer to
the exact result.
For small thresholds, it was previously observed in
generic spin systems that the contours of the OTOC assume a power law shape with exponents close to unity
[23]. Therefore, we attempt power law fits to our numerically exact contours from ETE, yielding excellent fits.
The fits are shown as gray dashed lines in Fig. 6, and
should be understood as an extrapolation of the shape of
the light cone from the L = 21 results. For small thresholds (θ = 10−5 ), the MPS/MPO approaches reproduce
the extrapolated contours with very high accuracy, confirming the power law fit from the smaller system size and
consistency with the exact result. For θ = 10−3 , the two
approximated approaches are still in quite good agreement with the fit of the ETE, although some differences
arise at later times. At higher thresholds, the difference
is even more significant, since already short times results
do not agree. This confirms our overall observation that
the MPS approaches considered here reproduce the tail
of the OTOC with good accuracy, while the growth and
saturation regimes are not well captured.

V.

CONCLUSION

We have compared different MPS approaches to study
information scrambling in a generic spin chain based on
both matrix-product states (MPS) and matrix-product
operators (MPO) and compared the results to an unbiased and numerically exact technique (ETE). For the
calculation of the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs)
in the Schrödinger picture based on MPS, we have shown
that the use of a unitary time evolution method (TDVP)
yields a significant improvement over the non-unitary
truncation used in the time evolving block decimation
(TEBD) algorithm. Furthermore we found that both
MPO TEBD and MPS TDVP reproduce the tail of the
OTOCs even at long times for low enough thresholds,
while the growth and saturation regime suffers from truncation errors. The obtained shape of the light cone in
large systems at low thresholds is in quantitative agreement with the ETE results at short times for smaller
system size. Moreover they also match the extrapolated
exact result even at late time. For larger thresholds,
closer to the information front, a discrepancy from exact results is observed, which we attribute to insufficient
convergence of both MPO TEBD and MPS TDVP results with bond dimension. However, our TDVP MPS
approach still yields a qualitatively correct ballistic propagation of information in contrast with the results obtained with MPO TEBD where after significant truncation the spreading of information appears to halt, making
the result unphysical. We also note that the asymptotic
saturation value of the OTOC is correctly reproduced in
our TDVP MPS approach, while strong truncation effects
in the MPO TEBD approach lead to a severe underestimation of the saturation value.
We conclude that both MPS techniques in the Heisenberg and Schrödinger picture yield consistent results for
the tails of the OTOC and their performance is comparable. However, the MPS TDVP approach comes at the
price of introducing a stochastic sampling of the OTOC
using random product states making it computationally
much more expensive. An interesting future direction
would be to apply our wave function approach to calculate the OTOCs in many body localized system to evaluate whether the logarithmic growth of entanglement allow us to gather reliable results in a broader region of
space-time and calculate the contours OTOCs at larger
thresholds.

In any MPS calculation, the convergence of the results
with the bond dimension is important. Here, we present
an analysis of the convergence of the OTOC results calculated by our stochastic TDVP and TEBD methods based
on MPS. We also analyze the convergence with the bond
dimension of our TEBD MPO results.
In Fig. 7, for a system of size L = 21, we show
the convergence of the OTOC C4,j (t) with bond dimension for the MPS time evolution methods that we compare in the main text (TDVP and TEBD). Since both
methods rely on a stochastic sampling of the trace in
Eq. (8), we eliminate the error induced by the stochastic sampling by selecting 5 random product states |ψk i

For MPS TEBD the error also decreases with the bond

errorbars for χ = 32), yielding very good agreement of
the results for low thresholds. At larger thresholds, the
discrepancy between the two bond dimension results becomes significant as expected.
We find that the convergence in bond dimension depends significantly on the initial state and therefore we

repeat this analysis for approximate OTOCs C4,j (t) using only single random product states and different bond
dimensions in Fig.9. From the 15 product states included
in Fig. 8, we select the states with the best and worst
convergence in bond dimensions to illustrate these state
to state differences. Overall convergence is only achieved
only for low values of the OTOCs, confirming the observation that the tail of the OTOC is reproduced accurately, while values at larger thresholds are not converged.

Convergence with bond dimension for larger
systems in TEBD MPO

In the case of the MPO TEBD approach, the study of
the convergence in bond dimension is facilitated by the
absence of stochastic sampling. The spacio-temporal dependency of the effect of bond dimension can be analyzed
by directly looking at extracted contour lines t(θ, j) of the
OTOC obtained from numerical solutions of the equation
C4,j (t) = θ for various thresholds and bond dimensions.
We present the result of this approach in Fig. 10. The
contours obtained with different bond dimension coincide
very well for small thresholds (up to θ = 10−3 ). However
a difference between χ = 64 and χ = 128 appears already
for θ = 10−2 at times t = 30, which we attribute to the
insufficient representation of the operator entanglement
of the operator in an MPO with χ = 64. The difference
is even more striking for θ = 0.1, where the results are
not converged and do not show the expected asymptotic
behavior of a linear light cone. The breakdown appears
earlier for the lowest bond-dimension as expected.
