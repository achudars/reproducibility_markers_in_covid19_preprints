Abstract
The Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experiments, MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and SBND,
are expected to have significant sensitivity to light weakly coupled hidden sector particles. Here we
study the capability of the SBN experiments to probe dark scalars interacting through the Higgs
portal. We investigate production of dark scalars using both the Fermilab Booster 8 GeV and
NuMI 120 GeV proton beams, simulating kaons decaying to dark scalars and taking into account
the beamline geometry. We also investigate strategies to mitigate backgrounds from beam-related
neutrino scattering events. We find that SBND, with its comparatively short O(100 m) baseline,
will have the best sensitivity to scalars produced with Booster, while ICARUS, with its large
detector volume, will provide the best limits on off-axis dark scalar production from NuMI. The
SBN experiments can provide leading tests of dark scalars with masses in the 50 - 350 MeV range
in the near term. Our results motivate dedicated experimental searches for dark scalars and other
long-lived hidden sector states at these experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Light weakly coupled hidden sectors may play a role in addressing some of the outstanding
puzzles in particle physics and cosmology, such as dark matter, neutrino masses, the matterantimatter asymmetry, the hierarchy problem, and inflation [1–4]. They also provide an
interesting physics target for a variety of intensity frontier experiments. One well known
example is proton beam fixed target experiments, including those used to study neutrino
oscillations. In these experiments, a beam of relativistic hidden sector particles produced
in the primary proton-target collisions passes through a downstream detector and decays
to visible Standard Model (SM) particles, providing a distinctive signature that can be
discriminated from beam-related neutrino and cosmic-ray induced backgrounds.
The Short-Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab utilizes three liquid argon time projection chamber detectors – SBND [5], MicroBooNE [6], and ICARUS [7] – situated along
the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) [8]. While the primary physics goals of the SBN program include searches for eV-scale sterile neutrinos (motivated by the LSND [9] and MiniBooNE [10–12] anomalies) and measurements of neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections,
these experiments are also expected to have significant sensitivity to hidden sector particles
in the MeV-GeV range. In this paper we study the capability of the SBN experiments to
search for dark scalar particles, S, interacting via the Higgs portal.
We consider production of dark scalars from collisions of both the 8 GeV Booster and
the 120 GeV Main Injector protons. Concerning the latter, MicroBooNE and ICARUS are
located approximately 8◦ and 6◦ off-axis with respect to the NuMI beam, implying that
the associated flux of dark scalars passing through these detectors can be substantial. We
perform a careful simulation of the BNB and NuMI beamlines that includes the targets,
magnetic focusing horns, and absorbers. While we also attempt to take account of various
experimental factors such as particle identification and reconstruction efficiencies, detection
thresholds, and measurement resolutions, a complete characterization of these parameters is
still under active experimental study, so our assumptions in this regard must be considered
preliminary. We consider two primary dark scalar signal channels in detail, 1) the S →
e+ e− channel, relevant for scalars below the di-muon threshold, and 2) the combined S →

µ+ µ− , π + π − channels which are important for somewhat heavier scalars. We study the
beam-related backgrounds to these signatures and design search strategies to efficiently
2

separate them from the signal. We also discuss the potential role of timing measurements
as a discriminator for heavy O(100 MeV) scalar particles.
We find that the SBN experiments have significant sensitivity to dark scalars with masses
below a few hundred MeV. In particular, SBND, being in close proximity to the BNB target,
has the best sensitivity to scalar particles originating from the Booster beam. On the other
hand, for scalars produced along the NuMI beamline from the Main Injector, we find that
ICARUS, with its large detector volume, will have the leading sensitivity. Notably, kaons
decaying at rest (KDAR) after stopping in the NuMI absorber could produce monoenergetic
scalars entering ICARUS at a different angle from neutrinos produced in the target, providing
a novel signature. In both cases, our projections cover regions of scalar mass – mixing
angle parameter space extending beyond existing experimental limits. Our results motivate
dedicated searches for dark scalars and other light weakly coupled particles at the SBN
experiments. We note that previous studies have examined the sensitivity of the SBN
experiments to heavy neutral leptons produced with the Booster beam [13] and the darktrident signature from dark matter produced in the NuMI beam [14]. Furthermore, a number
of studies have explored the reach of accelerator-based neutrino experiments to long-lived
and other exotic particles such as dark matter in recent years; see e.g. Refs. [15–53] and the
recent white paper [54].
The outline of this paper is as follows: In Section II we provide a brief review of scalars
interacting through the Higgs portal. Section III provides an overview of the SBN facillities.
Section IV describes our simulation pipeline for the signal and beam related backgrounds, as
well as our analysis strategy for the channels under consideration. Our results are presented
in Section V, and we conclude in Section VI with some discussion and outlook. An appendix
contains some results of our simulation validation.

II.

HIGGS PORTAL

We extend the SM by a new singlet scalar particle, S, which interacts through the Higgs
portal. There are two possible renormalizable portal couplings in general,

We will assume the dark scalar acquires a small coupling to SM particles via mass mixing
with the Higgs. This always occurs if the super-renormalizable term A in Eq. (1) is nonvanishing. However, even if A = 0, the dark scalar can acquire a vacuum expectation value for
appropriate choices of the scalar potential, which in turn leads to mass mixing. After diagonalization, there are just two parameters relevant for our phenomenological study, namely
the physical mass mS of the dark scalar and the scalar-Higgs mixing angle θ:

Given the tight experimental constraints on the mixing angle, we will be working in the
regime θ  1. Additional interactions between the scalar and the Higgs (e.g., hSS), while
important for higher energy collisions at the LHC, will not be relevant for the SBN experiments. As S inherits its couplings in Eq. (2) to SM particles from the Higgs, many important
phenomenological considerations can be recycled from light Higgs boson studies carried out
decades ago [55].
Starting from the Lagrangian (2) we can compute the decay rates of the dark scalar. The

For mS > 2mπ hadronic decays of the scalar become important. The description of hadronic
decays is complicated by strong interactions and resonance effects leading to a large theoretical uncertainty in the decay width for scalar masses of order 1 GeV. However, SBN will be
sensitive to scalars in the mass range of a few hundred MeV and below, and in this regime

FIG. 2. Dominant signal production process via kaon decays.

Besides kaon decays, B mesons have an even larger branching ratio to S and furthermore
allow for production of heavier scalars [17, 23, 62–64]. However, while such decays are
important for higher energy facilities such as the SPS and LHC beams at CERN, they will
not be relevant for the lower energy Booster and Main Injector beams due to the substantially
5

lower B production rate. A more promising process at these energies is scalar production
through proton bremsstrahlung, which also allows for production of heavier scalars. We have
estimated the sensitivity from proton bremsstrahlung using the results of Ref. [65], finding
that it leads to no additional sensitivity beyond that from Kaon decays. Additional sources
of low mass scalar production at these energies include rare π ± , η, η 0 decays, although they
are subdominant to kaon decays and will be neglected in our study.
There are a number of experimental and astrophysical constraints on the Higgs portal
scalar parameter space, but we will defer a discussion of these to Section V below. We now
move on to discuss the SBN experiments.

SBN EXPERIMENT SETUP

FIG. 3.

Coordinates in the “BNB frame” defined by a left-handed coordinate system with the

origin at the BNB target, the z-axis pointing to center of the SBN detectors, and the y-axis pointing
vertically upwards. We show the coordinates of the the BNB and NuMI targets, NuMI absorber,
and the SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS detectors in both aerial (left) and elevation (right)
views.

The sensitivity of an experiment to decays of long-lived dark sector particle decays depends primarily on the number of such particles that can be made to pass through the
detector and the ability of the detector to distinguish the decays from backgrounds. In
both these regards, the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program at Fermilab offers strong
6

capabilities for near future sensitivity. For Higgs portal scalars the dominant production
mechanism comes from kaon decays. The Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and the Neutrinos
at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam offer a large production of both focused and stopped
kaons with several detectors in the 100 to 1000 m range of their targets. Among these
detectors, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors of the SBN
program, namely the Short-baseline Near Detector (SBND), MicroBooNE, and ICARUST600, will have low thresholds and excellent particle identification. We therefore focus our
study on the signals of beam-produced dark scalars decaying in these detectors. Figure 3
shows aerial and elevation views of the Fermilab campus, including the locations of the BNB
and NuMI targets, NuMI absorber, and the SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS detectors.
In this section, we discuss the capabilities of both the beams and SBN detectors in turn.

TABLE I. Summary of the properties of the current Fermilab neutrino beams.

The Fermilab accelerator neutrino program currently consists of the aforementioned BNB
and NuMI beams. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages for the purposes of dark
scalar searches and will have its best sensitivity at different SBN detectors. We therefore
discuss the two in turn. Their properties are summarized in Table I.

1.

BNB

The BNB consists of 8 GeV momentum protons impinging on a beryllium target while
traveling close to due North. The SBN detectors are lined up along the beam axis at distances
from 110 m (SBND) to 600 m (ICARUS-T600). The accelerator delivered 3.1 × 1020 protons

on target (POT) in the 2018 fiscal year [66], for a current total of around 1.3 × 1021 POT

during MicroBooNE operation and an equivalent roughly 1.3 × 1021 expected from running
for around 4 years at that intensity for SBND and ICARUS. We take this number, 1.3×1021 ,
as our benchmark for our BNB-based studies. Charged mesons are focused by a magnetic
horn to deliver a beam enhanced in either neutrinos or anti-neutrinos.

2.

NuMI Beam

The NuMI beam is made by striking 120 GeV momentum protons on a graphite target.
The beamline is roughly north pointing along the axis from Fermilab to the MINOS far
detector in Minnesota. The SBN detectors are not along the beam axis, but are slightly
off axis. The beam does however pass at small angle with respect to both MicroBooNE
and ICARUS-T600. Given the higher energy of the beam and the angular spread in the
produced scalars, these detectors can have significant sensitivity to scalars produced with
the NuMI beam. The MicroBooNE detector is located a distance of roughly 685 m from the
target at an angle of 0.14 radians (7.8◦ ), while the ICARUS-T600 is 803 m at an angle of
0.097 radians (5.5◦ ). The accelerator delivered 5.7 × 1020 POT in the 2018 fiscal year [66],

for a projected total of close to 3 × 1021 expected from running for 5 years, which we take as

our benchmark for NuMI-based studies. The NuMI beam has two horns whose position and
current can be adjusted depending on the desired energy and type (neutrino or antineutrino)
of the beam. The actual running mode will be determined by NOνA physics requirements
and could have some effect on the final results. We assume the standard “medium energy”
mode horn locations, which have been used for the past several years [67], and neutrino
mode running with a 200 kA forward horn current configuration below.

B.

SBN Detectors

The SBN program consists of the SBND, MicroBooNE and ICARUS-T600 LArTPC
detectors positioned along the BNB. For the most part, the detectors function in similar
manners, with similar TPC designs. Though we assume the same detection capabilities
for the three SBN detectors in this study, we do account for their difference in volume
and location, as outlined in Table II. MicroBooNE is currently operating, while SBND and
ICARUS-T600 are expected to be collecting data by the end of 2019 and beginning of
2021 respectively [68, 69]. The volume and mass are particularly relevant for signal and
background rate calculation respectively as described below. Note that while we list the
full dimensions for a box shaped detector volume, we make the simplifying approximation
that the rates for the signal do not depend on the detailed geometry of the detector and
perform our calculations using a spherical detector with the correct fiducial volume. This
approximation is valid in the limit that the detector dimensions are much less than the
distance that the scalar travels before decaying. Since the detector dimensions are O(1 m),
while the distance the scalar travels is O(100 m), this approximation is valid at the 1% level.
We discuss detector effects and event reconstruction in detail below in Section IV C, after
further discussing the relevant signals and backgrounds.

mode. The simulations, based on Geant4 [72], incorporate the geometry of each beamline
including the targets, focusing horns and decay volumes. They take into account the full
evolution of the particles produced in the primary collisions of protons with the target,
including not only secondary meson production but also the subsequent interactions with
the beamline elements. In both codes, whenever a neutrino is produced in a particle decay,
information about the neutrino momentum and position, as well as its ancestor, is stored
using the dk2nu [73] format.
We use the ancestry information provided in the g4bnb/g4numi output to extract the
momentum and position of each kaon that decayed to a neutrino, at the time of decay. In
Figure 4, we show the kinematics of the kaons from both beams. Most kaons are produced
in the targets, and travel in the direction of the beamlines. The initial kaon momentum is
characteristic of the beam energy. Because subsequent interactions of the kaons with the
beam apparatus as well as secondary production, the kinematics of the kaons at the time
of decay to neutrinos can differ from the kinematics of the kaons produced in the beam
targets. The most notable effect is that at Booster (NuMI), approximately 2/3 (1/3) of
the kaons produced are stopped before decaying. These kaons, which decay isotropically
in the lab frame, are not shown in Figure 4. For NuMI, the kaons that are stopped in the
absorber provide an interesting source of signal, as the resulting scalars are monoenergetic

and enter the Booster beamline detectors at an angle that is quite different from those of
their counterparts arising from kaons decaying in the target. We will discuss this possibility
further In Sec. IV D.
Using the kaons, we then simulate K → πS decays for different scalar masses, yielding
the phase space distribution of scalars produced in each beamline. We consider only decays of K ± and KL0 , as the KS0 provides a negligible contribution due to its significantly
smaller branching ratio to scalars. The mixing angle θ sets the overall normalization of the
distribution, i.e. the number of scalars produced per POT.
Finally, for each of the SBN detectors, we consider the scalars from each beam that would
pass through the detector volume. If a scalar with velocity β and rest lifetime τ would enter
and exit a given detector at distances Lin and Lout from its production point, the probability
that it decays inside the detector is
P = e−Lin /γβτ − e−Lout /γβτ .

(6)

Figure 5 shows the distributions of the resulting scalar energy at the detectors which see the
most decaying scalars from each beam. For on-axis production at Booster, SBND covers the
greatest solid angle by far, and generally has the most scalar decays of the SBN detectors.
For off-axis production, both MicroBooNE and ICARUS are approximately 700 m away from
the NuMI target and only a few degrees off axis, while SBND is somewhat closer but much
11

further off axis, approximately 30 degrees. Because of the much larger ICARUS volume
(see Table II), more scalars from NuMI decay in ICARUS than in the other SBN detectors.
Typically, the scalar parent is a highly boosted kaon, so the scalar and its decay products are
all well-aligned with the beam direction. In Sec. IV D, we use these characteristic features of
the scalar decay products to design cuts to reduce backgrounds from neutrinos and cosmic
rays.
We have checked our pipeline in two different ways. First, we have reproduced several
neutrino flux predictions, at both the SBN detectors as well as MINERvA, with g4bnb and
g4numi. The results of this validation are in the Appendix. In addition, we have replaced the
Geant4-based codes with Pythia8 [74] simulations of the primary proton-target collisions,
neglecting additional interactions of the secondary particles within the beamline as well as
the propagation of the kaons before decaying to scalars. This check yields similar results to
those obtained in Sec. V with the dedicated codes.

B.

Background Generation

There are several sources of potential background events for the signal we are considering,
though all are in principle reducible. As the SBN detectors are operated on the surface,
cosmic ray induced backgrounds are a significant worry. On the other hand, it is rare for
cosmic rays to mimic the signal we are considering, as any tracks or showers should come
in pairs and generally appear in the middle of the detector. Furthermore, systems are being
designed specifically to tag and eliminate cosmic ray backgrounds at MicroBooNE [75].
Beyond such a tagger, a combination of timing and angular cuts can further reduce this
background, though it could in principle still hinder reconstruction of signal events. We do
not consider this background further in this study.
The remaining backgrounds are due to beam neutrinos. Both interactions in the dirt
and in the detector volume can contribute, though we only consider interactions in the
fiducial detector volume, which should dominate for the analysis we have developed. Even
this dominant background cannot fully mimic our signal and several cuts can be used to
drastically reduce it, as discussed below.
To generate the background, we use the neutrino flux predictions presented in [76]. The
fluxes are used for input for generation of neutrino interactions on

The π 0 in the GENIE output are decayed to photons. These photons, along with any other
final state particles reported to GENIE are smeared and thresholds are applied according to
the description in Section IV C below.

C.

Detector Effects

In this section, we discuss our assumed detection thresholds, energy and angular resolutions, and particle identification capabilities.
The target volume consists of liquid argon, which provides a dense medium for neutrino interactions. This density provides an increased worry about neutrino-generated backgrounds,
but the other features make the SBN detectors nevertheless well-suited to a search for decaying dark sector particles. The liquid argon is placed in an electric field which drifts
ionized electrons due to energetic charged particles traveling through the argon. The electrons are collected on wire planes that allow for roughly millimeter precision measurement
of the position of the interaction in the plane direction. The third coordinate of the charge
deposition is reconstructed based on the drift time. The time of the interaction can also be
reconstructed with nanosecond precision if scintillation light from the interaction is collected.
The deposited energy can be determined from the charge collection, allowing a reconstruction of the energy deposited by a track per unit length, which in turn allows for strong
particle identification and calorimetry. Given all of this information, the full four vector of
the particles produced through an interaction in the detector volume can be reconstructed
with excellent angular resolution and good energy resolution.
Many of the capabilities of the SBN LArTPC detectors are under active investigation
and are not known. For the purposes of our study, we assume certain figures of merit
that we believe are reasonable. As understanding of the detectors improves, we expect to
have updated sensitivities. We now discuss the properties that we assume, as well as some
motivation for these assumptions.
Particle identification is one of the main advantages of LArTPC technology. That said,
certain particles can be rather tricky to distinguish. The particles that are stable on the
scale of the position resolution of LArTPC detectors in the 100 MeV energy range of interest
are e± , γ, p, µ± , and π ± . The first two are generally referred to shower particles as they
create electromagnetic cascade showers above 33 MeV, while the last three are referred to as
13

track particles, as they appear as single tracks. It is worth noting that, in some instances,
the distinction between track and showering particles is not 100% accurate. We assume
however that this distinction is perfectly accurate in the analysis below.
The signal of interest consists of an isolated e+ e− , µ+ µ− or ππ pair. Since no neutrino
interactions from the beam produce precisely this final state, the backgrounds are, in principle, reducible. There are, however, neutrino interactions that can fake our signal in a
LArTPC.
For e+ e− pairs, the primary worry is from photons arising from either neutral pion decay or hard radiation. Photons and electrons both lead to electromagnetic showers in the
detector. Photons, however, only begin their shower after a conversion length of roughly
14 cm. Both single and two photon events can fake the signal absent any other visible
activity from the neutrino interaction. Single photons will convert into an e+ e− pair, which
directly mimics our signal. The kinematics of the conversion process, however, very rarely
lead to widely separated e+ e− pairs and the pair typically has small invariant mass. Based
on Geant4 simulations, we find that 92.5% of 100 MeV photon conversions and 99% of
500 MeV photons conversions lead to electron-positron pairs with an opening angle of more
than 10◦ . This background is thereby virtually eliminated. The isolation cut also effectively
eliminates the two photon background. The signal showers should begin with two electron
tracks that originate at the same spatial point. The two photon background, however, is
expected to have its showers starting at well-separated vertices due to the differing conversion lengths of the two photons. In fact, for isolated photons, a straightforward calculation
based on the conversion length of 14 cm shows that over 99.5% of photon pairs have vertices
separated by more than the position resolution of LArTPCs, which we take to be 3 mm.
Similar arguments eliminate the subdominant backgrounds due to charged-current electron
production in association with a photon. Therefore, for a sufficient isolation cut, the search
for e+ e− pairs should be effectively background free.
For the remaining searches, the primary background comes from pions and muons. Protons, muons, and charged pions all leave tracks, but protons are distinguishable by their
distinct energy deposit per unit length compared with track length. It is worth noting that
some of the muons and pions from our signal have large energies and are expected to not
be contained by the SBN detectors. From Geant4 simulations, we expect a muon of energy
1 GeV to have a track length of around 4 m, for example. A distribution of muon can14

didate energies will be shown below in Fig. 13. This does not necessarily mean that the
event cannot be reconstructed, but rather makes reconstruction more challenging. For the
present analysis, we do not take containment effects into account though we do not expect
this to significantly affect our sensitivity estimates. Muons and charged pions are in general
quite challenging to tell apart as they deposit energy at similar rates. Charged pions leave
larger energy deposits at the end of their tracks due to their additional nuclear interactions,
but the ability to utilize this has not yet been quantified. We therefore conservatively assume that they are indistinguishable. Note that the charge of the muon and pion should
be distinguishable based on capture of µ− that is not possible for the opposite charge. The
effectiveness of this procedure has not yet been determined, so we do not attempt to use
the muon or pion charges. Since pions and muons are assumed to be indistinguishable, the
backgrounds to searches are typically somewhat large, coming from µ± π ∓ inelastic charge
current events and π ± π ± deep inelastic events. We make use of kinematic cuts as described
below to reduce these backgrounds.
Next, we discuss the kinetic energy thresholds for observing particles. Thresholds in
LArTPCs are typically in the 10-100 MeV range, though they depend on the specific detector, context and particle. For on-beam analyses, the threshold is set by requiring that a
sufficient number of hits are seen in the collection plane. MicroBooNE typically requires at
least 20, setting thresholds of roughly 80 MeV for protons, 40 MeV for π ± /µ± , and 20 MeV
for EM showers, though muons are generally required to have longer tracks. Reconstruction
of shorter proton tracks should be possible as demonstrated by ArgoNeuT [77], allowing
for thresholds of 21 MeV for protons and 10 MeV for π ± /µ± . The DUNE CDR quotes a
comparable set of thresholds used for its Fast Simulation [78]. Light collection is crucial for
off-beam analyses and helps with energy reconstruction in all cases. We assume that light
collection thresholds are met if the tracking thresholds are met.
We assume a threshold of 30 MeV for both electrons and photons, motivated by the
requirement that they have at least one hard interaction in the detector. We also assume a
threshold of 30 MeV for muons and pions, as motivated by a requirement of at least 10 hits in
the TPC. While this is slightly more aggressive than the current MicroBooNE assumption,
improvements on reconstruction should be made in the near future. We also reconstruct
protons with a threshold of 20 MeV for the purposes of vetoing. While this is lower than
the nominal reconstruction threshold, it is noted that proton reconstruction is not required;
15

we only need to determine whether a proton was present in the event.
Energy resolution is key for making an accurate mass determination of the decaying
scalar. These numbers are not available on a particle-by-particle basis for the three SBN
experiments, but ArgoNeuT has demonstrated muon momentum resolution of 5-10% and
proton energy resolution of 6-10% [79]. For its Fast Monte Carlo, the DUNE CDR quotes
30% for exiting muon-like tracks, with better resolutions for contained tracks based on track
√
length [77]. They further quote a resolution of 2% ⊕ 15%/ E [GeV] for electromagnetic
showers. A phenomenological study of heavy neutral leptons adopted yet different numbers,
√
√
6%/ E [GeV] for muons and 15%/ E [GeV] for electromagnetic showers [13]. A recent
MicroBooNE thesis has found even better resolution for contained muons and good resolution
on the neutral pion peak [80, 81]. It is worth noting that some of the region of interest
for our searches involves high energy particles that may not be contained in the detector,
which would degrade both resolution and particle identification capabilities. Based on these
numbers, we assume 10% resolution on electromagnetic showers, 3% momentum resolution
on muons and pions below 300 MeV kinetic energy as these are likely to be contained, and
10% momentum resolution on muons and pions above this threshold as they are likely to
exit.
Finally angular resolution should be excellent for tracks, given the excellent position
resolution. We adopt a universal angular resolution for particles of 0.03 rad or 1.73◦ as in
Ref. [5].

TABLE III. Summary of the detector effects assumed in this study. The thresholds for the electromagnetic and muon-like particles are in line with the best available studies thus far [78]. The
resolutions are adapted from Refs. [80, 81].

Our analysis assumptions are shown in Table III. We apply these thresholds and smearing
at the level of final state four vectors from the event generator chains, noting that these
16

numbers are subject to change as LArTPCs are better understood. We further veto on
additional photons and electrons above 2 MeV, as well as any additional pions or muons,
which will also lead to visible electrons when they decay.
We make one final comment regarding neutrons and recoiling nuclei. Both can lead to
additional energy deposits in the detector, the neutrons scattering widely throughout the
volume [82] and the recoiling nucleus activity centered near a neutrino interaction point [69].
Decaying mediators do not leave such signals in the detector, so vetoing such activity would
be an excellent way to reduce backgrounds. Nevertheless, there is no official study of these
effects, so we simply ignore neutrons and recoiling nuclei in our analyses.

is essentially no irreducible background to this signature, but it is somewhat challenging to
determine the reducible backgrounds. We begin by selecting events with no reconstructed
muons, charged pions, or protons above the thresholds in Table III. By further selecting
events with exactly two electromagnetic showers, we eliminate a large fraction of the back17

estimate the effect of this requirement, we require that the signal candidates have a separation of at least 10◦ so that their vertex of production is well-reconstructed. This is sufficient
to effectively eliminate all of the background as the conversion points for diphoton events
will be well separated and single photon conversions are strongly peaked at narrow opening
angle, as explained above in Sec. IV C. A cut on the angle between the reconstructed scalar

momentum and the beamline could be helpful in reducing the background from cosmics,
but is likely not necessary for the e+ e− case and we do not apply such a cut. An additional
search for a bump in the invariant mass of the e+ e− would lead to a measurement of the
mass of the scalar. A diagram for a candidate background event is shown in Fig. 6. The
event distributions in the key variables on which we cut are shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9.
The distributions are drawn after the reconstruction and smearing procedure described in
Sec. IV C before applying the isolation requirement and after requiring reconstruction of a
single e+ e− candidate pair. No additional kinematic cuts are applied at this level. Note that
the distributions in candidate angular separation and reconstructed scalar-beamline angle
show a second peak corresponding to kaons decaying at rest to scalars, which frequently
occurs in the absorber.

µ+ µ− and π + π −

Above 210 MeV, muon and pion channels quickly dominate. As discussed above, distinguishing µ± and π ± is difficult. There is some recent work along this direction using
machine learning techniques, for example in Ref. [83]. Since the ability to distinguish these
particles is not fully test, we do not attempt to do so. We rather assume µ± and π ± are
indistinguishable. If they could be distinguished, it is worth noting that there is essentially

challenging to distinguish a charged pion from a muon in a LArTPC, we assume that all charged
pions are misreconstructed as muons, as discussed in the main text.

Kaon decay at rest

One intriguing possibility using the NuMI beamline is to make use of the fact that the
detectors are off of the beam axis. The portion of the beam that does not interact with the
target is absorbed farther down the beamline. The line between the absorber and ICARUS is
about 110 m long and forms an angle of about 46◦ with respect to the beamline. This raises
the possibility of searching for particles coming from kaons decaying at rest (KDAR) in the
absorber. In fact, MiniBooNE has recently measured monoenergetic muon neutrino charged
current events arising from KDAR in the NuMI absorber [84], and one can also envision
searching for exotic particles such as dark scalars in this manner. These scalars would
be monochromatic and all coming from a specific angle, leading to significant background
reduction. Since the e+ e− analysis above is already effectively background free, we do not
search for KDAR specifically in our analysis. If the cosmic ray background proves to be
more challenging than anticipated, searching for KDAR kinematics could prove helpful.
Furthermore, if a discovery of an excess is made, searching for KDAR would be an excellent
tool for validation, as well as for probing the nature of the model due to the specific angle
of 46◦ for the reconstructed scalar and the monochromatic energy of the scalar. For µ+ µ−
and π + π − channels, the particles coming out of the monochromatic scalar decay would be
very soft and challenging to reconstruct as they are produced near threshold in the scalar
decay and the scalar itself is produced close to threshold at high mass. One could perhaps
alleviate the reconstruction challenge by doing a simultaneous reconstruction of the two
short candidate tracks, but development of such an analysis is beyond the scope of this
work. Due to these challenges, we do not pursue the KDAR channel further for the µ+ µ−
or π + π − channels either.

4.

Other channels: π 0 π 0 , γγ

Events with two π 0 could be rather striking, with as many as 4 EM showers. The odds
that all 4 showers are reconstructable is small and it is rather challenging to analyze such
events. It is worth noting that the branching fraction of this channel is never dominant,
either. We therefore defer further discussion of it to future analysis.
Rare decay channels of the scalar could be interesting to study as well, particularly in

FIG. 14. Timing of the scalar signal (red) and neutrino background (blue) arrival at the front

peaks at hundreds of ns past the initial collision, one from kaons decaying in the target and one

order to confirm the nature of the scalar in the event of a discovery. In particular, at loop
level, decay to γγ is induced just as for the standard Higgs. Though this branching fraction
is at the 10−3 level, it is of great interest for confirming the nature of the scalar. Furthermore,
non-minimal models could have a larger branching fraction to photons. For example, in a
model with heavy charged states that do not couple to the Higgs, but do couple to the dark
scalar, the diphoton coupling could be larger.

5.

Discrimination with timing

We focus in this paper on the prospects for scalar decays during the times when neutrino
events would also be occurring in the SBN detectors. However, unlike neutrinos, the scalar
may travel at a speed sufficiently slow compared to the speed of light that its decay is delayed
23

relative to the neutrino arrival. While the beam spills themselves are relatively long, 1.6 µs
long at BNB and 10 µs at NuMI, each spill contains multiple shorter bunches of protons.
For instance, BNB employs proton bunches that are approximately 2 ns long, separated by
20 ns. The ns-level resolution of the SBN detectors can in principle be used to search for
scalars decaying in between the times when neutrino events are expected [5]. We show the
timing expected for the signal as compared to the neutrino background in Fig. 14 for a longlived 300 MeV scalar. Most of the signal events occur late enough relative to the neutrino
background that they could be discriminated using timing cuts. However, the delay can be
much longer than the bunch spacing. There are also additional peaks at late times coming
from KDAR-induced scalars that can be produced in either the target or the absorber.
It would be interesting to further investigate the use of timing to look for delayed scalar
decays, as has been discussed in the context of other light hidden sector models [13, 85].
Depending on the mass, the length of the delay could vary considerably, and some care
would be necessary in the case when scalars produced from one proton bunch decay in a
detector after neutrino events from a later proton bunch. Furthermore, in order to perform
such a study, new developments would be required in the data acquisition and triggering of
the SBN experiments in order to look outside of standard timing windows. Such a detailed
study is beyond the scope of this work, and we do not attempt to use timing information
further. Nevertheless, it should prove useful in further discriminating between BSM signals
from heavy particles and neutrino events.

V.

RESULTS

We display the combined results of the analyses of the previous section in Fig. 15. The
regions enclosed by solid lines would be probed using our cuts, where we have conservatively
assumed that sensitivity will require a minimum signal of 5 events or 100% of the background. We have also indicated, with dashed lines, where 5 events would occur in SBND
and MicroBooNE, from Booster protons, and ICARUS, from NuMI protons. These should
be thought of as the ultimate possible reach for these analyses, if efficiencies could be improved and backgrounds eliminated. Similarly, we have shown where 5 scalars would decay
in ICARUS from kaons decaying at rest in the NuMI absorber, as the maximum achievable
sensitivity of a targeted KDAR analysis. For comparison, we also show other current limits

on light Higgs portal scalars from CHARM [86, 87], LHCb [88, 89], E787/E949 [87, 90] and
SN 1987A [91].
Fig. 15 shows that the SBN detectors would be sensitive to new areas of Higgs portal
parameter space in the MeV-GeV region, including the gap in the E787/949 kaon decay
search due to K → ππ backgrounds. In addition, the Fermilab facilities would afford a
better reach than the similar search at the CHARM detector, which used the 400 GeV
SPS proton beam. While SPS produced many more B mesons per POT than either of the
Fermilab beams we consider, there were only 2.4 × 1018 POT in all, orders of magnitude less
than can be achieved at Fermilab. Also, the thick copper target used for the SPS beam led
to many kaons being stopped before decaying, significantly reducing the potential number
of scalars from kaon decays [87]. Notably, off-axis production at the SBN detectors from
NuMI can lead to even stronger bounds than on-axis production from Booster. This is again
primarily due to the larger number of POT that the NuMI beam can provide.
There are several proposed or upcoming facilities that could also be sensitive to light
25

Higgs portal scalars [4]. Those with relatively similar time scales and bounds to the SBN
program include FASER [61, 92], NA62 [91, 93, 94], and SeaQuest [40, 95]. In particular,
a recent study considering scalars decaying outside NA62 suggests significant improvement
is possible for scalars lighter than the dimuon threshold [96]. Nevertheless, for some scalar
masses we project that Fermilab facilities can test scalars with mixing angles as low as a
few times 10−5 , in a region which is only otherwise covered by detectors with longer times
to construction and data-taking [4]. For mS of order of hundreds of MeV, this represents
an order of magnitude improvement relative to the current bounds. Owing to the large
number of POT that can be collected at the Booster and NuMI targets, the SBN detectors
are well-situated to be the leading probes of the Higgs portal for sub-GeV scalars.

VI.

OUTLOOK

Searches for sub-GeV hidden sectors have progressed rapidly in recent years, with implications for models of light dark matter, neutrino masses, and beyond. Intensity frontier
experiments provide useful probes of these sectors, and in this work we have investigated
the use of the SBN detectors at Fermilab to test the scalar portal. While the detectors are
aligned with the 8 GeV Booster proton beam, the 120 GeV NuMI protons can also cause
appreciable off-axis production, particularly at ICARUS. The sensitive LArTPC detectors
are well-suited to observe the scalar decay products, including electrons, muons and pions.
Using Geant4-based simulations of the beamlines and GENIE to generate neutrino-induced
backgrounds, we have analyzed potential signal channels using simple kinematic cuts. As
the performance characteristics of the detectors are still under investigation, we have taken
generally conservative assumptions in projecting sensitivity curves, which are summarized
in Figure 15. Both on-axis and off-axis production of light scalars can be seen at the SBN
detectors, which achieve greater sensitivity than existing limits from CHARM, LHCb, and
E787/E949. Our results show an improvement of the sensitivity to the scalar-Higgs mixing
angle by over an order of magnitude for masses of order of hundreds of MeV, up to the
threshold mK − mπ . Should our estimated sensitivities be reached, the SBN detectors would
provide better probes of the scalar portal than currently planned experiments on similar
timescales [4].
With greater understanding of the background, the “ideal” curves in Figure 15 could
26

be attained. One could also consider running in beam dump mode to reduce neutrino
background, as was done to search for dark matter in MiniBooNE [52, 53]. For mS <
2me , being able to observe nearly collinear electron-positron pairs while maintaining good
separation between electrons and photons would be useful. For mS > 2me , it will be
necessary to improve the discrimination of muons from pions. Being able to reconstruct
softer objects can also help our analyses, particularly in the KDAR case where gaps appear
at masses corresponding to scalars decaying to slowly moving daughter particles. Finally,
we have mentioned the use of timing information to reduce the background by looking for
scalars which arrive late in the detectors. It would be useful to perform a more complete
analysis of this technique, including out-of-time backgrounds such as cosmic rays, in the
future.
Given the small number of renormalizable portals between the SM and a new hidden
sector, models for light weakly coupled mediators are highly predictive. The upcoming SBN
program at Fermilab will provide a competitive probe of the Higgs portal.

Appendix: Simulation validation

In this appendix, we validate the results of our simulation as described in Sec. IV, by
reproducing predictions for neutrino fluxes from both the Booster and NuMI beams. The
g4bnb and g4numi codes simulate the production of particles in fixed-target proton collisions,
as well as their subsequent interactions and decays. When a neutrino is produced in a decay,
information is stored about its production position and momentum, as well as that of the
particles in its ancestry. Each neutrino is given an importance weight, which accounts for
generator choices (such as a raw weighting towards higher momentum mesons produced in
primary collisions for statistical purposes) as well as branching ratios.
For our analysis, we have used the neutrinos produced by g4bnb and g4numi which have
kaons as parents. We generate scalars by starting with the kaon position and momentum, and
simulating an isotropic 2-body decay, i.e. K → πS. Accounting for the relative branching
fractions of K → ν + X and K → πS, we scale the importance weight of each scalar from
the neutrino weight given by the Geant 4-based simulations. Then, we check whether each
randomly generated scalar would pass through the detector in question, and multiply the
weight by an additional factor as in Eq. 6 to include the chance that the scalar decays within
27

the detector.
To test our framework, in Fig. 16 we have used all the neutrinos coming from mesons in
the Geant 4-based simulations, i.e. pions and kaons but not muons. Then, we have replaced
the K → πS decay with M → πν, in effect reproducing the last step of the Geant 4based neutrino simulations where a neutrino parent is decayed to a neutrino. We have then
asked whether each neutrino would pass through various detectors, aiming to reproduce the
Booster fluxes predicted at MiniBooNE [70] and MicroBooNE [97], as well as the NuMI
fluxes predicted on-axis at MINERvA [71] and off-axis at MicroBooNE [98]. The 3-body
muon decays which we neglect contribute negligibly to the fluxes of the neutrino flavors
which we use for validation.
In all cases we see very good agreement, as most of the (anti-)muon neutrinos in (anti)neutrino mode come from two body decays of pions or kaons, and our ignorance of muon
decays and three body decays is of little consequence for the fluxes we seek to obtain. Fig. 16
confirms the validity of our procedure for extracting data about mesons from neutrinos as
reported by g4bnb and g4numi, as well as for simulating their decays.
