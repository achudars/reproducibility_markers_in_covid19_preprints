We consider a class of correlation measures for quantum states called optimized correlation measures, defined as a minimization of a linear combination of von Neumann entropies over purifications
of a given state. Examples include the entanglement of purification EP and squashed entanglement
Esq . We show that when evaluating such measures on “nice” holographic states in the large-N
limit, the optimal purification has a semi-classical geometric dual. We then apply this result to
confirm several holographic dual proposals, including the n-party squashed entanglement. Moreover, our result suggests two new techniques for determining holographic duals: holographic entropy
inequalities and direct optimization of the dual geometry.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most important tools in AdS/CFT is the
RT/HRT prescription [1, 2] for computing the von Neumann entropy of a boundary region A in the state ρAB :
SA (ρAB ) =

J ∈R

A[M]
,
4GN

(1)

where A[M] is the area of a homologous extremal surface
anchored to the boundary of A in the dual spacetime. (1)
provides an elegant interpretation of the bulk-boundary
correspondence: an information-theoretic quantity about
the boundary state can be computed as the area of a
“dual” geometric object in the bulk, which is often simpler to do than working directly in the boundary theory.
If ρAB is pure, then SA captures the entire entanglement structure of the state. However, the von Neumann
entropy is not the only correlation measure for a generic
quantum state; indeed, it is well-known that the von Neumann entropy is a poor measure of entanglement once one
considers mixed or n-party states with n > 2. Despite
this, with a few exceptions, correlation measures beyond
entropy have received little attention in a gravitational
context. We therefore aim to study holographic duals
for measures better suited to studying the entanglement
structure of holographic mixed states, which are ubiquitous when studying e.g. black holes.
We will consider a class of correlation measures called
optimized correlation measures, whose bipartite forms
were extensively studied in [3]. Given an arbitrary nparty state ρA1 ...An , these measures are defined to be a
minimization of a function f α :
E α (A1 : . . . : An ) =

ρA1 ...An . Denoting the set of all 22n − 1 non-empty combinations of these regions by R, the function f α is a linear
combination of von Neumann entropies on the extended
Hilbert space:

f α (|ψi hψ|) =
αJ SJ (|ψi hψ|),
(3)

where α ∈ R2 −1 and the sum runs over all elements J
of
PR. As in [3], we will impose a non-negativity condition
J αJ ≥ 0, or else choosing part of the extension to
be maximally mixed on an enormous Hilbert space gives
E α → −∞. An example of such a measure that has
recently garnered significant interest is the entanglement
of purification [4]:
EP (A : B) =

min

|ψiAA′ BB ′

SAA′ .

(4)

for which αAA′ = 1 and all other αJ = 0. For holographic states, EP is conjectured to be dual to a particular minimal surface in the bulk called the entanglement
wedge cross-section EW [5–8]. The EP = EW conjecture,
as well as related proposals for the dual to EW , has since
attracted significant attention [9–29]. Other examples include the R and Q-correlation introduced in [3] and the
squashed entanglement Esq [30], which we discuss in the
main body of the paper.
A generic correlation measure of the form (2) is generally very difficult to compute, due to the enormous
parameter space of purifications that that needs to be
searched. As a result, finding the holographic duals to
such measures can be similarly difficult, relying on indirect evidence such as consistency checks with inequalities, or requiring strong assumptions like the surfacestate correspondence [31]. Holographic duals to other
optimized correlation measures have been proposed [32–
34], but their conclusions rely on the assumption that the
optimal purification in (2) can be taken to be geometric,
in the sense that the purification lives in the boundary
CFT Hilbert space and is dual to a semi-classical geometry. The question of the assumption’s validity was first
posed in [32] in the context of the squashed entanglement
Esq , and has since remained an open problem in holography. Some recent progress towards an answer appeared

2
in [17], where it was argued that geometric minimization
was sufficient to compute the bipartite EP , and hence
one could employ the bit thread formulation of holography [35] on the purifying state to provide evidence for
EP = EW .
In this work, we argue that, up to reasonable assumptions we will outline below, something even stronger
holds: for any n-party optimized correlation measure
evaluated on “nice” holographic states, minimizing over
the subset of geometric purifications is sufficient to
achieve the minimum over all purifications. Using our
result, we confirm the holographic proposals in [32–34],
and in particular, we find a dual to the n-party squashed
entanglement. Moreover, our result suggests that holographic duals can be determined by directly optimizing
the purified geometry, as opposed to relying on indirect
evidence such as obeying the same set inequalities.
Throughout this paper, we will work at leading order
in the large-N , large central charge limit. We will also
assume that a suitable regularization scheme is in place,
e.g. a radial cutoff, such that all the correlation measures
of interest are finite and Hilbert spaces can be tensorfactorized. We will moreover assume that the purifying
subsystem is finite dimensional and, crucially, that the
infimum in (2) can turned into a minimum; this is an
open question for generic quantum states, but we argue
below that this is not a major obstacle for holographic
states.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we
review the necessary assumptions and properties of holographic states to prove our claim. In Section 3, we apply
the properties of holographic states to prove the sufficiency of minimizing over states with semi-classical duals. In Section 4, we discuss applications of the result
to holographic systems and determining duals to various correlation masures. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss
potential avenues of future work for understanding holographic states.
S
To make notation cleaner we will use U = ni=1 Ai
to refer to the union of all S
n parties A1 , . . . , An of an
n-party state, and use U ′ = ni=1 A′i to refer to the purifying subsystem, e.g. ρA1 ...An = ρU . We will also draw a
distinction between entanglement measures and total correlation measures; entanglement measures are intended
to capture purely quantum correlations, while the more
general total correlation measures are allowed to capture
a combination of quantum and classical correlations. Entanglement measures are usually required to satisfy more
stringent properties that are not satisfied by a generic
E α , as we discuss below. Finally, although we use the
term “minimal surface,” our arguments do not rely on
time symmetry, and we therefore expect no issues to arise
in considering dynamical setups with extremal surfaces.

PRELIMINARIES
Correlation measures

We first briefly introduce the general, axiomatic approach to correlation measures in quantum information.
We are given a functional E defined on the set of density matrices D(H) of a Hilbert space H, and in order for
E to be a good correlation measure, we require that E
satisfy some given set of axioms that are believed to be
reasonable. Arguably the most important axiom for an
entanglement measure is monotonicity under local operations and classical communication (LOCC):
E(ρ) ≥ E(Λ(ρ)),

(5)

for any LOCC operation Λ, as entanglement nevers
increase under LOCC. Other axioms that are usually
enforced for entanglement measures include that they
should vanish on separable states, be continuous in the
asymptotic regime corresponding to n → ∞ copies of a
given state, and be normalized in the sense that E(Φd+ ) =
log d for the maximally mixed state Φd+ of size d. One
can show that any such E that satisfies these axioms and
is monotonic under LOCC reduces to the von Neumann
entropy on pure states, singling it out as the unique (bipartite) entanglement measure for pure states [36].
The converse is not true: a correlation measure E that
reduces to the von Neumann entropy on pure states is not
generically a good entanglement measure. However, such
measures are still of interest if they are monotonic under
LO – these are total correlation measures, which may be
sensitive to both quantum and classical correlations in a
given state, rather than just quantum correlations from
entanglement. The dependence on classical correlations
allows these E to increase under CC. The most wellknown example of such a measure is the bipartite mutual
information:
I(A : B) = SA + SB − SAB ,

(6)

which captures all correlations, quantum and classical,
between A and B [37], and reduces to SA for a pure
state. In other words, SA is really the unique correlation
measure for bipartite pure states in general. EP is also an
example of a total correlation measure, as it is monotonic
under LO (but not CC) and trivially reduces to SA on
pure states.
While the story is very clean for bipartite, pure states,
the situation is unclear for any other kind of state. Consider, for instance, a generic mixed state ρAB . Then we
will generally find:
SA (ρAB ) 6= SB (ρAB ),

SAB (ρAB ) 6= 0

(7)

so SA is not only capturing the entanglement between A
and B, but can be seen as receiving contributions from
the entanglement between A and a purifying subsystem.
The search for good entanglement measures for mixed

3
states remains an active subfield of quantum information; see e.g. [38] for a discussion on various, generally
inequivalent, measures. The inequivalence corresponds
to differing operational interpretations. Moreover, SA is
a bipartite correlation measure, and cannot capture intrinsically n-party entanglement for n > 2. The simplest
example is the GHZ3 state:
1
|GHZ3 iABC = √ (|000i + |111i),
2

(8)

with the party labels corresponding to each qubit. The
reduced density matrix of any 2 qubits is
trA |GHZ3 i hGHZ3 |ABC =

1
(|00i h00| + |11i h11|), (9)
2

which is a separable state, and hence contains no entanglement between qubits BC. The entropy SA = log 2 is
only able to capture the bipartite correlations between A
and BC, rather than the intrinsic tripartite correlations.
In holography, we are interested in the theory of correlation measures because mixed states and multipartite
states are ubiquitous, e.g. a black hole with inverse temperature β or multiple boundary subregions, and the issues with the von Neumann entropy mean studying the
entanglement structure of such states is difficult. However, just as the von Neumann entropy has a geometric
dual, we expect that other information-theoretic quantities defined on the boundary state should have a geometric dual. Understanding the dual objects can be
extremely useful, because there are situations where the
geometric description is easier to work with than the CFT
description. A simple example is computing the entropy
of a single interval in the vacuum state of a holographic
2D CFT: the CFT calculation, while not particularly
complicated, is more work than computing the area of
a geodesic in AdS3 . Indeed, E α is very difficult to compute for an arbitrary quantum state; EP is one of the
simplest examples of an optimized correlation measure
and already suffers from this issue. The geometric dual
generally makes these measures easier to compute or understand, which can lead to insight into the fine-grained
structure of holographic states. Conversely, holographic
systems are a useful testing ground for quantum information, precisely because we are able to understand quantities that are usually extremely complicated for generic
quantum states.

B.

Linearity and geometric purifications

To make our argument, we will need to employ two
crucial properties of holographic states. The first property we will use is that entropies in holography are linear at leading order in the 1/N expansion [39]. More
precisely, given a superposition of holographic states
PM
i
ρAB =
i pi ρAB with exponentially-suppressed overlap (as is the case for states with macroscopically-distinct

dual geometries), the entropy of the A subregion is approximately
SA (ρAB ) =

M
X

pi SA (ρiAB ) + Smix + . . . ,

(10)

i

PM
where Smix = − i pi log pi is the entropy of mixing,
and the ellipses indicate terms of order O(1/N 2 ) and
smaller. The assumptions made in computing (10) break
down when M ∼ eO(c) , with the most apparent effect
being that Smix can become leading order.
Now let |ψiABA′ B ′ be a purification of ρAB defined on
the entire boundary. The second property we will use
is that we can expand |ψi as a superposition of states
{|φi i} dual to semi-classical geometries:
|ψi =

M
X
i

ci |φi i ,

(11)

such that {|φi i} are themselves purifications of ρAB [17]:
trA′ B ′ |φi i hφi |ABA′ B ′ = ρAB ,

(12)

for all |φi i. Because our result relies so crucially on this
result, we reproduce the argument from [17] for the existence of such a decomposition here with added detail
and attention paid to the necessary assumptions.
Given a holographic state ρAB , let |ψiABA′ B ′ be any
purification on the boundary with a geometric dual. We
are free to act on the purifying subsystem HA′ B ′ with any
operation that preserves the purity of the overall state;
this is the standard statement from quantum mechanics
that all purifications of a given state in the same Hilbert
space are related by a unitary acting on HA′ B ′ . In particular, we are free to insert e.g. pairs of black holes using
the gluing procedure of [40]. Let {|φi i} be the set of
purifications generated by this procedure – these states
all live in the holographic CFT Hilbert space and will
generally be a proper subset of the set of all geometric
purifications.
We now make a reasonable assumption: we can fill the
purifying subsystem with black hole microstates. That
is, because we are free to tune the parameters of the black
holes in the purifying subregion to fill very small or very
large regions, such states should have support over any
complete basis of HA′ B ′ . Therefore, given an arbitrary
basis |βi i of HA′ B ′ , we should be able to write
X
X
cijk |βj i hβk | .
cij |βj i hβj | +
σi = trAB |φi i hφi | =
j

j

(13)
We now make another assumption: the black hole microstates we consider are typical in the sense that there
is a basis in which the cijk are exponentially suppressed
in N and cij is approximately invertible; for example, we
could consider the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
for the energy eigenbasis. For two σi , σj with i 6= j, their
bulk geometries in HA′ B ′ are macroscopically distinct,

4
and hence σi , σj are approximately orthogonal up to exponential corrections. Then any superposition of the |φi i
will also be a purification of ρAB . The invertibility of cij
implies we can also invert the σi , so that
X
c−1
(14)
|βj i hβj | ∼
ij σi ,
i

which implies that there are at least dim HA′ B ′ many
linearly independent σi . In other words, we are able to
construct any density matrix in the purifying subsystem
as a superposition of geometric states on the subsystem.
Again invoking the unitary equivalence of purifications,
we conclude that, up to exponential corrections, any arbitrary purification on the boundary can be expanded as
a superposition of geometric purifications.
We will assume the requisite assumptions are satisfied
to use the above properties: we do not work beyond leading order in 1/N , we work with an appropriately dense
and typical subspace of black hole microstates, and the
number of terms M that appear in (11) is exponentially
suppressed relative to the full Hilbert space dimension.
In other words, the results of this paper will only apply to suitably “nice” holographic states. Note, however,
that these assumptions are common in much of the literature and much of the standard lore in holography similarly only holds for such “nice” states; for example, it is
known that the error correction properties of AdS/CFT,
and hence other properties, can be radically changed with
large M e.g. [41]. Indeed, we do not expect the results
of this work to apply beyond these “nice” states.
III.

MINIMIZATIONS OVER GEOMETRIC
EXTENSIONS

We now present the main result of this paper: when
evaluating a correlation measure E α of the form (2) on
a holographic state, it is sufficient to minimize only over
purifications that are geometric, so that the purifying
subsystem corresponds to a spatial region on the boundary.
Suppose we are interested in computing some n-party
optimized correlation measure E α for an arbitrary nparty CFT state ρU = ρA1 ...An on a Hilbert space
H = ⊗Hn that is a subsystem of the full boundary
Hilbert space HCFT . Let |ψiUU ′ be a purification of ρU ,
and moreover, let us choose |ψiUU ′ such that it achieves
the desired minimum over all purifications:
X
E α (A1 : . . . : An ) = f α (|ψi hψ|) =
αJ SJ (|ψi hψ|),
J ∈R

(15)
For our arguments to hold, we will need to assume that
|ψiUU ′ exists and lives in the large-N CFT Hilbert space
HCFT . This is not immediately obvious, given that the
purifying subsystem may have unbounded, but finite, dimension. As a heuristic argument for why these assumptions are reasonable, we note that we are free to tune our

regulator to make H have arbitrarily large, but finite, dimension. A caveat is that we are ultimately limited by a
minimal cutoff scale that vanishes in the infinite-N limit.
Modulo this caveat, the idea is then to keep tuning H
until it can fit such a |ψiUU ′ . For a particular choice of
α, it may be possible that there exists a suitably finite
bound on the dimension of the purifying subsystem, in
which case this assumption is unnecessary. This is the
case for EP .
Now expand |ψiUU ′ in the basis of holographic states
with semi-classical duals, with the added property that
each state in the expansion also be a geometric purification of ρU :
|ψiUU ′ =

M
X
i

ci |φi iUU ′ ,

(16)

such that trU ′ |φi i hφi |UU ′ = ρU for all i. Writing pi =
|ci |2 , we can lower bound E α as follows:
E α (A1 : . . . : An ) = f α (|ψi hψ|)
X

(22)

for some geometric purification |φi iUU ′ of the original
state ρU . We have hence found that the minimum over
all purifications can always be achieved, to leading order,
by only considering geometric purifications.
Many correlation measures of interest are usually defined as optimizations over all extensions of a given state,
rather than purifications. An extension of a state ρU
is simply any state ρUE in an extended Hilbert space
HU ⊗ HE such that trE ρUE = ρU . Such correlation measures have the form:
X
E α (A1 : . . . : An ) = inf
αJ SJ (ρUE ),
(23)
ρU E

J ∈R

where R is the order 2n−1 − 1 set of all non-trivial combinations of A1 , . . . , An , E. However, it is clear that this

5
is entirely equivalent to the definition in (2), as purifying the ρUE to |ψiUEE ′ leaves all the entropies appearing
on the RHS unchanged, and hence the optimization will
yield the same result. The difference lies only in the redundancy of the search. Using EP as an example, we
could equivalently write its definition as:
EP (A : B) = min SAA′ (ρABA′ )
ρABA′

=

min

|ψiABA′ B ′

SAA′ (|ψi hψ|ABA′ B ′ ).

(24)
(25)

ER (A : B) =

Therefore, our result also applies to correlation measures
defined in this way. For the sake of clarity with respect to
other literature, we will always use the most common definitions of correlation measures, even if such definitions
are not written as optimizations over purifications.
IV.

APPLICATIONS IN HOLOGRAPHY
A.

Optimizing geometries

Our result find immediate application in the search
for holographic duals to E α , whereby we can directly
optimize the appropriate combination of surfaces dual to
the desired linear combination of entropies on a given
geometry. Two recent examples are the Q-correlation
EQ and R-correlation ER [3], defined as:


1
(26)
min SA + SB + SAE − SBE
ρ
2 ABE
1
=
min [SA + SB + SAA′ − SBA′ ] ,
2 |ψiABA′ B′

ER (A : B) = min SAB + 2SAE − SABE − SE (28)
2 ρABE


1
=
min
SAB + 2SAA′ − SABA′ − SA′ .
2 |ψiABA′ B′
(29)

EQ (A : B) =

The interest in these measures stems form the fact that
not all correlation measures of the form (2) are good correlation measures in the sense that E α are generically not
monotonic under LO. [3] found that enforcing the monotonicity
P condition, along with the non-negativity condition J ∈R αJ ≥ 0, leads to the intersection of convex
cones in α-space whose extreme rays include EP , EQ , ER ,
and the squashed entanglement Esq , which we discuss in
the next subsection.
In [33, 34], holographic duals to EQ and ER were
proposed, but with the necessary assumption that the
minimization over geometric purifications is sufficient to
achieve a minimum over all purifications. With this assumption, one finds that EQ is dual to the entanglement
wedge mutual information EM defined by
EM (A : B) =



1
SA + SB + SAA′ − SBA′ ,
min
′
′
2AB

which is nothing more than the statement of EQ , but
with the minimization over geometric regions A′ , B ′ that
purify ρAB and the entropies interpreted as minimal surfaces. Such an expression is useful precisely because, as
described in [33], there are cases where the geometric description of the system is particularly simple, e.g. two
disjoint regions in AdS3 , so that EM can be understood
intuitively, and is even tractable to compute. Similarly,
one finds the holographic dual to ER :

(30)



1
SAB + 2SAA′ − SABA′ − SA′
min
′
′
2AB
(31)

= EW (A : B),

(32)

which reduces to nothing more than the entanglement
wedge cross-section, adding ER to a growing list of candidate information duals to EW .
Our result confirms the results above, as we have shown
that the crucial assumption regarding geometric minimizations is also valid. More generally, we can make a
proposal for the holographic dual of any E α as simply
E α (A1 : . . . : An ) = min
f α (|ψi hψ|),
′
′
A1 ...An

(33)

with the A′1 . . . A′n interpreted as geometric regions that
purify the original state. Again, the utility of such an expression is that there likely exist situations where the geometric description is relatively simple, making E α easier
to understand or compute.
We remark here that applying this result to the bipartite EP = EW conjecture gives
EP (A : B) = min
S(AA′ ) = EW (A : B),
′ ′
AB

(34)

so that EW can be interpreted as a single von Neumann
entropy in some purified geometry. This is very similar
to an independent proposal for the information-dual of
EW given in [19], where a simple von Neumann entropy,
called the reflected entropy SR , defined on a canonical
purification of the given state is dual to 2EW . Understanding the relationship between the geometries dual
to the purifications in EP , ER , and SR could provide
insight into why multiple distinct correlation measures
reproduce the same value in holography.
B.

Holographic entropy inequalties

As another method of determining holographic duals,
our result permits the use of holographic entropy inequalities in computing optimized correlation measures. One
example of note is the squashed entanglement Esq , defined by [30, 42]:
1
(35)
min I(A : B|E)
2 ρABE
1
= min (SAE + SBE − SABE − SE ) (36)
2 ρABE

Esq (A : B) =

6
The squashed entanglement has been extensively studied
in the context of quantum information [43–50], as it satisfies several abstract properties that make it arguably
the most promising measure of purely quantum correlations between parties in mixed states. For example: if
ρAB is a pure state, then the only extensions of the state
are tensor products ρABE = ρAB ⊗ ρE , so
1
1
I(A : B|E) = I(A : B) = SA ,
2
2

can be evaluated on holographic states by applying MMI:

(38)

which is easily interpreted: there cannot be more quantum correlations than total correlations.
While Esq is difficult to compute for generic quantum
states, it was observed in [32] that the computation of Esq
for holographic states could potentially be made simple
because holographic entropy satisfies the monogamy of
mutual information (MMI):
− I3 (A : B : E) ≥ 0,

EI (A : B) =



1
′
′
′
′
min I(AA : BB ) − I(A : B )
2 ρABA′ B′
(42)

(37)

and Esq = SA , reducing to the von Neumann entropy on
pure states. Moreover, it was proven in [44] that Esq is
faithful, i.e. Esq = 0 if and only if ρAB is a separable
state. By taking E = ∅, one obtains the upper bound
1
I(A : B) ≥ Esq (A : B),
2

This technique of using a holographic entropy inequality to make correlation measures computable is quite general: as observed in [33], the conditional entanglement of
mutual information (CEMI) [51]:

(39)

where I3 (A : B : E) = SA +SB +SE −SAB −SAE −SBE +
SABE is the tripartite information. It is quite easy to find
counter-examples to (39) for generic quantum states, e.g.
the 4-party GHZ state, so (39) is a special property of
holographic states. Rewriting Esq as a minimization over
the tripartite information gives:
1
1
I(A : B) + min [−I3 (A : B : E)] .
2
2 ρABE
(40)
In general, the state ρABE that achieves the minimum
in (40) need not be geometric in the sense that E may
not correspond to a spatial region, and hence MMI need
not apply. Fortunately, per our result, the minimum in
(40) can indeed be achieved by considering only geometric extensions, so the computation is simple: choosing
the empty extension E = ∅ achieves the lower bound
−I3 (A : B : E) = 0. Note that this corresponds to a
purification |ψiABEE ′ where E is empty and E ′ is any
purifier for ρAB . We conclude that the squashed entanglement always saturates its upper bound

I(AA′ : BB ′ ) ≥ I(AA′ : B) + I(AA′ : B ′ )
≥ I(A : B) + I(A′ : B)
+ I(A : B ′ ) + I(A′ : B ′ )

1
I(A : B)
2

(41)

in holographic systems, giving the holographic dual to
the bipartite Esq as the appropriate sum of minimal
surfaces dual to SA , SB , and SAB . Moreover, taking
the squashed entanglement to be a genuine measure of
purely quantum correlations, we conclude that correlations within “nice” holographic, which states are entirely
captured by 12 I, are dominated at leading order by quantum entanglement.

(44)

after which the positivity of the mutual information implies that the optimal extension is the trivial one, so that
EI (A : B) = 12 I(A : B). The CEMI is another candidate entanglement measure that obeys several pleasing
axioms such as monotonicity under LOC, faithfulness,
asymptotic continuity, and convexity. The implication
for holographic states is similar to that of Esq = 21 I:
quantum correlations dominate the total correlations of
the state.
We can further use (41) to obtain the holographic dual
for other correlation measures. The saturation of Esq for
holographic states implies that any bipartite entanglement measure defined as a constrained minimization of
1
1
2 I(A : B|E) over extensions E will reduce to 2 I(A : B),
so long as the constraint is compatible with the trivial
extension. One example is the c-squashed entanglement
c
Esq
, which is a “classical” version of Esq , in the sense that
the extension E is constrained to be classical [38, 42, 52]:

c
have Esq
≥ Esq , and the lower bound is achieveable with
the single-element ensemble ρAB ⊗ |0i h0|E . We must
c
therefore have Esq
= Esq , and a corresponding holoc
graphic dual to Esq
.
If E α is subadditive and its regularization exists, it
also collapses to 21 I. Specifically, we consider the class of
α
measures Ereg
within the set of E α that equal Esq which
also satisfy:
1 α ⊗n
α
E (ρAB ), such that E α ≥ Ereg
.
n
(46)
Then by the additivity of Esq (ρAB ) = n1 Esq (ρ⊗n
AB ) [30],
we find
α
Ereg
(A : B) = lim

n→∞

α
Esq = E α ≥ Ereg

and hence Esq = Ereg

(47)

7
We are also able to use geometric minimization to find
the holographic dual to the multipartite squashed entanglement, introduced in [53, 54]. We first define a multipartite mutual information [37, 55, 56]:
I(A1 : . . . : An ) =

n
X

I(A1 . . . Ai−1 : Ai ).

(48)

i=2

The multipartite conditional mutual information I(A1 :
. . . : An |E) simply replaces the terms on the RHS of
(48) with their conditional forms. The multipartite Esq
is then defined to be
Esq (A1 : . . . : An ) =

1
min I(A1 : . . . : An |E). (49)
2 ρA1 ...An E

We can again apply MMI to find:
1
I(A1 : . . . : Ai )

I3 (A1 . . . Ai−1 : Ai : E)

Esq (A1 : . . . : An ) =

(52)

and since the lower bound is achievable by the trivial
extension, we find that the n-party Esq is equal to onehalf the n-party mutual information. This confirms the
conjecture made in [33], and, just as in the bipartite case,
c
immediately implies that the multipartite Esq
equal 12 I.
We can similarly find the dual to the multipartite CEMI
[51]:
EI (A1 : . . . : An )

and the lower bound is again achievable by the trivial
extension, and hence the multipartite EI is dual to the
multipartite 12 I.

We stress here that (41) and other similar equalities
are leading order statements in the 1/N expansion – we
do not expect equality to hold in the presence of perturbative corrections. Indeed, if this were not the case,
then (41) would imply that holographic states have no
classical correlations. Rather, the more accurate statement is that quantum correlations dominate the mutual
information, while classical ones are subleading.
C.

Axiomatic entanglement measures and the
mutual information

We comment here on the apparent degeneracy of holographic duals to 12 I(A : B). If we work with the heuristic that quantum correlations are the dominant type of
correlation in holographic states, then it is perhaps not
too surprising that any genuine measure of quantum correlations should saturate at the mutual information at
leading order. Therefore, we might, in fact, expect that
axiomatic entanglement measures could all equal the mutual information.
One way to formalize this statement is as follows. Consider an entanglement measure E that satisfies the following axioms:
(a) Normalization: E(ρAB ) = log d if ρAB is a maximally entangled state of rank d.
(b) Monotonicity: for any process Λ consisting of local
operations and classical communication (LOCC),
we have E(ρAB ) ≥ E(Λ(ρAB ))
(c) Continuity: given two states ρ, σ on H, as ||ρAB −
AB )−E(σAB )
σAB ||1 → 0, we also have E(ρ1+log
→0
dim H
(d) Regularization: The regularization E ∞ (ρAB ) =
E(ρ⊗n
AB )
n

exists for n → ∞.

Any measure that satisfies these axioms also satisfies the
bounds [36]:
ED (ρAB ) ≤ E reg (ρAB ) ≤ EC (ρAB )

(57)

where ED is the distillable entanglement [57, 58]:


(58)
and EC is the entanglement cost [57, 59]:

(59)
Operationally, ED corresponds to the maximal rate that
one can obtain Bell pairs from asymptotically many
copies of ρAB , while EC corresponds to the minimal
rate that one can produce asymptotically many copies
of ρAB from Bell pairs. Note that if E is additive,
then E ∞ (ρAB ) = E(ρAB ) and (57) becomes a bound on

8
E(ρAB ) itself. Examples of entanglement measures that
satisfy these axioms include the entanglement of formation EF :
X
pi S(|ψi i hψi |), (60)
EF (ρAB ) = P
min
i

pi |ψi ihψi |=ρAB

i

where the minimization is taken over all pure state decompositions {pi , |ψi i} of ρAB , and the relative entropy
of entanglement ERE :
ERE (ρAB ) =

inf

σAB ∈Sep(HAB )

D(ρAB ||σAB ),

(61)

where D(ρ||σ) = tr[ρ log ρ−ρ log σ] is the relative entropy
and Sep(HAB ) is the set of separable states on HAB .
Importantly, Esq satisfies all 4 axioms and is additive,
so:
EC ≤ Esq ≤ ED .

(62)

If EC = ED , then we naturally have that all entanglement measures bounded by EC and ED are equal. For
pure states, EC = ED = SA . If EC = ED on holographic
states (at leading order), then because we have already
computed Esq , we would conclude
EC = ED = E ∞ = Esq =

1
I(A : B),
2

(63)

leading to a large degeneracy of holographic duals to
1
2 I(A : B). Note again that we do not require EC = ED
exactly, but only approximately. Due to the operational
nature of EC and ED , they are extremely difficult to
compute for all the simplest of states and can also exhibit counter-intuitive behaviors, e.g. there exist states
which have non-zero entanglement but zero distillable entanglement [60]. Operationally-defined quantities have
not received much attention in the context of holography,
and a very interesting direction for future study would be
a deeper exploration of these objects, leveraging special
properties of holographic states to simplify their analysis.
Some recent progress studying ED in holography is
related to the equality of the smooth max and minentropies for holographic states [61, 62]. The max and
min-entropies of a state ρAB are defined as:
Smax = log(rank(ρAB )),

(64)

log(λ−1
min (ρAB )),

(65)

Smin =

where λmin is the minimal eigenvalue of ρAB . The smooth
versions of these quantities are defined to be:
ǫ
Smax
=
ǫ
Smin
=

min

log(rank(σAB )),

(66)

max

−1
log(λmin
(σAB )),

(67)

||ρ−σ||1 <ǫ
||ρ−σ||1 <ǫ

that is, they are the minimal max and maximal minentropies of states that are in an ǫ-ball around ρAB , where
the trace distance is the metric on the space of density

matrices. It can be shown [62, 63] that evaluating these
quantities on holographic states yields:
√
ǫ
Smax
= SA + O( S)
(68)
√
ǫ
(69)
Smin = SA − O( S).
In other words, the smooth max and min-entropies are
equal, at leading order, to the von Neumann entropy.
This result was then used in [63] to show that the oneshot entanglement distillation of a holographic pure state
well-approximates ED . In other words, the entanglement
spectrum of a holographic state is due almost entirely
to maximal entanglement across the entangling surface.
This result matches our intuition that quantum correlations are maximal for holographic states, in the sense
that Esq saturates its upper bound. Then at the level of
entropies, we can imagine replacing ρAB with an appropriate number of Bell pairs across the partition, which is
quite evocative of EC = ED .
V.

DISCUSSION

By using special properties of holographic states, we
have shown that optimized correlation measures in holography can be computed, to leading order, by only considering geometric extensions of a given holographic state,
provided the states satisfy a set of given assumptions.
The most pressing future direction will be an analysis of
the assumptions and the degree to which they are reasonable.
We applied our result to confirm the holographic duals
for various entanglement measures, including EQ , ER ,
c
, and EI . Because all our results are leading
Esq , Esq
order statements, it would be interesting to analyze the
form of the quantum corrections that spoil the degeneracy of duals to 12 I and EW .
In our argument, we did not make use of any properties
of the optimal purification |φi i, besides the fact that it is
geometric. Clarifying the properties of this class of purifications would be an interesting future direction. One
immediate example is understanding the purifications involved in the EP = EW and ER = EW proposals. Moreover, we know of several other entanglement measures
related to EW [19–29], for which our result will likely be
useful in analyzing their connections to EP and ER .
Although our result confirms several conjectured holographic duals, it alone does not provide candidate duals
for the optimized correlation measures. We did not need
to use any properties of the bulk spacetime, other than its
existence and satisfying certain reasonable assumptions,
so generally more tools are necessary. In determining
the holographic dual to Esq , we used the MMI property
of holographic states. However, MMI is not the only
such inequality, and forms one part of the more general
“holographic entropy cone” [64–66] of inequalities that all
holographic states must satisfy, but are not satisfied by
generic quantum states. It is likely that these inequalities

9
will similarly prove useful for computing entanglement
measures and their holographic duals of higher-partite
holographic states. Indeed, one could even define entanglement measures of the form (2) such that the minimization over geometric extensions is simple to compute using
holographic entropy inequalities.
Another direction for finding holographic duals is the
bit threads formulation of holography [35], which has
proven very useful for analyzing EP = EW [16–18]. We
expect that our result, which implies a bit thread configuration exists for the optimal purification in E α , will
be a useful tool for finding or proving other holographic
dual proposals.
A promising direction is to use the saturation of the
bipartite squashed entanglement to gain insight into the
fine-grained structure of holographic states. In certain
cases, the saturation of entropy inequalities or the bounds
of information quantities enforces some structure on a
state. For example, it is known that the conditional
mutual information vanishes on a bipartite state if and
only if the state is a so-called “quantum Markov chain”
[67]. We expect that states with maximal squashed entanglement should should have constraints on their form,
which in turn imply constraints on the form of holographic states. An example of such a state can be found
in [68]. Determining such constraints for generic quantum states is likely a difficult task, but it may be possible to, again, leverage properties exclusive to holographic

states to make progress in this direction. We leave such
explorations to future work.
Finally, it would be extremely interesting to find evidence for or against the conjecture that ED = EC for
holographic states. Not only would confirmation likely
lead to strong constraints on their fine-grained structure,
it would also imply a whole host of correlation measures
are dual to the mutual information. This also motivates
work towards determining the holographic duals of measures such as EF and ERE , whose values could provide
evidence in one direction or the other. We leave such
explorations to future work.
