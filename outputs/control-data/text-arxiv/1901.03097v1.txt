Abstract—Backscatter communication (BSC) technology can
enable ubiquitous deployment of low-cost sustainable wireless
devices. In this work we investigate the efficacy of a full-duplex
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) reader for enhancing the
limited communication range of monostatic BSC systems. As this
performance is strongly influenced by the channel estimation
(CE) quality, we first derive a novel least-squares estimator for
the forward and backward links between the reader and the
tag, assuming that reciprocity holds and K orthogonal pilots are
transmitted from the first K antennas of an N antenna reader.
We also obtain the corresponding linear minimum-mean squareerror estimate for the backscattered channel. After defining the
transceiver design at the reader using these estimates, we jointly
optimize the number of orthogonal pilots and energy allocation
for the CE and information decoding phases to maximize the
average backscattered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for efficiently
decoding the tag’s messages. The unimodality of this SNR in optimization variables along with a tight analytical approximation
for the jointly global optimal design is also discoursed. Lastly, the
selected numerical results validate the proposed analysis, present
key insights into the optimal resource utilization at reader, and
quantify the achievable gains over the benchmark schemes.

BACKGROUND

Backscatter communication (BSC) has emerged as a promising technology that can help in practical realization of sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) [2], [3]. This technology thrives
on its capability to use low-power passive devices like envelope detectors, comparators, and impedance controllers, instead of more costly and bulkier conventional radio frequency
(RF) chain components such as local oscillators, mixers, and
converters [4]. However, the limited BSC range and low
achievable bit rate are its major fundamental bottlenecks [5].
A. State-of-the-Art
BSC systems generally comprise a power-unlimited reader
and low-power tags [6]. As the tag does not have its own
transmission circuitry, it relies on the carrier transmission from
the emitter for first powering itself and then backscattering its
data to the reader by appending information to the backscattered carrier. So, instead of actively generating RF signals to
communicate with reader, the tag simply modulates the load
impedance of its antenna(s) to reflect or absorb the received

carrier signal [7] and thereby changing the amplitudes and
phases of the backscattered signal at reader. There are three
main types of BSC models as investigated in the literature:
• Monostatic: Here, the carrier emitter and backscattered
signal reader are same entities. They may or may not
share the antennas for concurrent carrier transmission to
and backscattered signal reception from the tag, leading
respectively to the full-duplex or dyadic architectures [6].
• Bi-static: The emitter and reader are two different entities
placed geographically apart to achieve a longer range [8].
• Ambient: Here, emitter is an uncontrollable source and
the reader decodes this backscattered ambient signal [4].
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a monostatic BSC system
with a multiantenna reader working in the full-duplex mode.
Each antenna element is used for both the unmodulated carrier
emission in the downlink and backscattered signal reception
from the tag in the uplink. In contrast to full-duplex operation
in conventional communication systems involving independently modulated information signals being simultaneously
transmitted and received, the unmodulated carrier leakage can
be much efficiently suppressed [9] in monostatic full-duplex
BSC systems [10]. The adopted monostatic configuration
provides the opportunity of using a large antenna array at the
reader, to maximize the BSC range while meeting the desired
rate requirements. This in turn is made possible by the beamforming (array) gains for both transmission to and reception
from the tag. However, these performance gains of multipleinput-multiple-output (MIMO) BSC system with multiantenna
reader are strongly influenced by the underlying channel
estimation (CE) and tag signal detection errors. Noting that
the tag-to-reader backscatter uplink is coupled to the readerto-tag downlink, novel higher order modulation schemes were

2

investigated in [6], [7] for the monostatic BSC systems like the
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. A frequencymodulated continuous-wave based RFID system with monostatic reader, whose one antenna was dedicated for transmission
and remaining for the reception of backscattered signals, was
studied in [11] to precisely determine the number of active tags
and their positions by implementing the matrix reconstruction
and stacking techniques. Further, the practical implementation
of the full-duplex monostatic BSC system with single antenna
Wi-Fi access point as the reader was presented in [12].
Other than these monostatic configurations, designing efficient detection techniques for recovering the messages from
multiple tags due to the ambient backscattering has also
gained recent interest [13]–[17]. Considering a full-duplex two
antenna monostatic BSC model, authors in [13] investigated
ambient backscattering from a Wi-Fi transmitter that while
transmitting to its client using one antenna, uses the second
antenna to simultaneously receive the backscattered signal
from the tag. Assuming that the BSC channel is perfectly
known at the reader, a linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE) based estimate of the channel between its transmit and receive antenna was first used to eliminate selfinterference and then a maximum likelihood (ML) detector
was proposed to decode the tag’s messages, received due to
the ambient backscattering. Investigating blind CE algorithms
for ambient BSC, authors in [17] obtained the estimates for
absolute values of: (a) channel coefficient for RF source to tag
link, and (b) the composite channel coefficient involving the
sum of direct and backscattered (which is the scaled product
of forward and backward coefficients) channels. However, the
actual complex values of the individual forward and backward
channel coefficients in multiantenna BSC were not estimated.
Lastly, we discuss another related field of works [18],
[19] (and references therein) that involve the estimation of
product channels in the half-duplex two-way amplify-andforward (AF) relaying networks. Other than the fact that these
setups involve product or cascaded channels as in the BSC
settings, there are some significant differences. First, compared
to AF relays assisting in source-to-destination transmission by
actively generating new information signals, BSC does not
involve a transmitter module at the tag. Second, these AF
relays generally [18], [19] adopt the spectrally-inefficient halfduplex mode because the underlying severe self-interference
in full-duplex implementation needs complex interference cancellation techniques. Thirdly, the CE in AF relaying scenarios
involve two-phases, where in the first phase source-to-relay
channel is estimated at the relay. Then in the second phase, the
cascaded source-to-relay-to-destination channel is estimated
by the destination using CE outcome of the first phase as
feedback sent by relay. Therefore, the existing CE algorithms
developed for AF relaying networks cannot be used in BSC
because tags do not have any radio resources like AF relays
to help in separating out the two channels in the product.

S IGNIFICANCE

Here after highlighting the research gap addressed and the
scope of this work corroborating its practical significance, we
outline the key contributions made in the subsequent sections.
A. Novelty and Scope
Since the BSC does not require any signal modulation,
amplification, or retransmission, the tags can be extraordinarily
small and inexpensive wireless devices. Thus, they can form an
integral part of the IoT technology [2] for realizing ubiquitous
deployment of low power devices in smart city applications
and advanced fifth generation (5G) networks [3]. Here, in
particular the BSC system with single antenna tag and multiantenna reader has gained practical importance because of two
key reasons: (a) shifting the high cost and large form-factor
constraints to the reader side, and (b) tag size miniaturization
and cost reduction are key for numerous applications. Another,
advantage of BSC, especially the ambient one, is that it can
coexist on top of existing RF-band, digital TV, and cellular
communication protocols. However, the realization of all these
goals is still very unrealistic because for the monostatic BSC
configurations with carrier generator and receiver sharing the
same antenna(s) suffer from the short communication range
bottleneck. Further the backscattered or reflected signal quality
gets severely impaired due to strong interference from other
active reader in a dense deployment scenario which is also very
costly. Lastly, the two-way BSC, involving cascaded channels,
suffers from deeper fades than conventional wireless channels
which degrades their reliability and operational read range.

3

The scope of this work includes addressing these challenges
by optimally utilizing the resources at multiantenna reader for
accurate CE of backscattered link and efficiently decoding the
reflected signal from tag to enable longer range quality-ofservice (QoS)-aware BSC. Although the optimal CE protocol
presented in this work is dedicated to the monostatic BSC
settings with reciprocal tag-to-reader channel, the methodology proposed in Sections IV and V can be extended to the
nonreciprocal-monostatic or bi-static BSC systems where the
tag-to-reader and reader-to-tag channels are different. However, in contrast to the monostatic BSC where channel reciprocity can be exploited, for the ambient and bi-static settings,
the CE phase needs to be divided into two subphases. In the
first phase, the direct channel between the ambient source, or
dedicated emitter, and reader can be estimated by keeping the
tag in the silent or no backscattering mode [12]. Thereafter,
in the second phase, where the tag is in the active mode
with its refection coefficient set to a pre-decided value, the
estimated channel information from the first phase can be used
to separate out the estimate for the tag-to-reader channel from
the product one. Detailed investigation combating practical
challenges in designing an optimal CE protocol for ambient
and bi-static settings is out of the current scope of this work
and can be considered as an independent future study based
on the outcomes of this paper. It may also be noted that, in
contrast to conventional non-backscattering systems where for
estimating the channel vector between an N -antenna source
and single-antenna receiver requires single pilot transmission,
bi-static BSC with an N -antenna reader and K-antenna emitter
will require atleast K orthogonal pilots. However, for the
monostatic BSC, we show later that the optimal PC for an
N -antenna reader needs to be selected between 1 and N .
As noted from Section I-A, the existing works on multiantenna reader-based BSC either assume the availability of
perfect channel state information (CSI) [5]–[9], or focus on
the detection of signals from multiple tags by using statistical
information on the ambient transmission and the BSC channel [12]–[16]. Focusing on the explicit goal of optimizing the
wireless energy transfer to a tag, [20] obtained an estimate
for the reader-to-tag channel by assuming that the reciprocal
tag-to-reader channel is partially known, and only one reader
antenna is used for reception. In contrast to these works, we
present a more robust channel estimate that does not require
any prior knowledge of the BSC channel. However, for those
cases where prior information on channel statistics is available,
we also present a LMMSE estimator (LMMSEE). Lastly, the
proposed CE protocol obtains the estimates directly from the
backscattered signal, without requiring any feedback from tag.
B. Key Contributions
We present, to our knowledge, the first investigation of
optimal CE for the monostatic full-duplex BSC setup with
an N antenna reader. As depicted in Fig. 1, the least-squares
(LS) and LMMSE estimates are obtained using isotropically
radiated and backscattered K ≤ N orthogonal pilots during
CE phase. Next, during the information decoding (ID) phase,
maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and maximum-ratio com-

bining (MRC) are used along with optimal utilization of reader
resources to maximize the achievable beamforming gains.
Our specific technical contributions are summarized below.
• Joint CE and resource allocation based optimal transmission protocol is proposed to maximize the achievable
array gains during BSC between a single antenna semipassive tag and a monostatic full-duplex MIMO reader.
• For efficient CE, a novel LS estimator (LSE) for the BSC
channel is derived. The global optimum of the corresponding non-linear optimization problem is computed
by applying the principal eigenvector approximation to
the underlying equivalent real domain transformation of
the system of equations defining the solution set.
• From this nontrivial solution methodology, the LMMSEE
for backscattered channel is also presented while accounting for the orthogonal pilot count (PC) used for CE1 .
• A tight approximation for the average backscattered
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) available for ID is derived
using the LSE or LMMSEE obtained after the CE phase
involving K orthogonal pilots transmission from the first
K antennas at reader. The concavity of this approximated
SNR in the time or energy allocation for CE phase is
proved along with its convexity in the integer-relaxed PC.
• Using the above mentioned properties, the closed-form
expression for the jointly optimal energy allocation and
orthogonal PC at the reader is derived, that closely
follows the globally optimal joint design maximizing the
average effective backscattered SNR for carrying out ID.
• Numerical results are presented to validate the proposed
analysis, provide optimal design insights, and quantify
the achievable gains in the average BSC SNR for ID.
III. S YSTEM M ODEL
A. Adopted BSC Channel and Tag Models
We consider the traditional monostatic BSC system [6],
[20] consisting of one multiple antenna reader, R, with N
antennas, and a single antenna tag, T . To enable full-duplex
operation [9], each of the N antennas at R can transmit a
carrier signal to T . Concurrently, R receives the resulting
backscattered signal. This results in a composite (cascaded)
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system defined by the
transmission chain R-to-T -to-R (as shown in Fig. 1). For
enabling full-duplex operation, R includes a decoupler which
comprises of automatic gain control circuits and conventional
phase locked loops [9]. So, with careful adjustment of the
underlying phase shifters and attenuators, the carrier signal
can be effectively suppressed out from the backscattered one
at the receiver unit [21]. However, exploiting the fact that
R performs an unmodulated transmission, this decoupler can
easily suppress the self-jamming carrier, while isolating the
transmitter and receiver units’ paths, to eventually implement
the full-duplex architecture for monostatic BSC settings [10].
We assume flat quasi-static Rayleigh block fading where the
channel impulse response remains constant during a coherence
interval of τ samples, and varies independently across different

K = N while deriving the LSE, and the LMMSEE for h was not presented.

coherence blocks. The T -to-R wireless channel is denoted by
an N × 1 vector h ∼ CN (0N ×1 , β IN ). Here, parameter β
represents the average channel power gain incorporating the
fading gain and propagation loss over T -to-R or R-to-T link.
For implementing the backscattering operation, we consider
that T modulates the carrier received from R via a complex
baseband signal denoted by xT , A − ζ [8]. Here, the loadindependent constant A is related to the antenna structure and
the load-controlled reflection coefficient ζ ∈ {ζ1 , ζ2 , . . . , ζV }
switches between V distinct values to implement the desired
tag modulation [2]. Further, we consider a semi-passive BSC
system [22], where T utilizing the RF signals from R for
backscattering, is equipped with an internal power source to
support its low power on-board operations, without waiting to
have enough harvested energy. This reduces access delay [4].
B. Proposed Backscattering Protocol
As the usage of multiple antennas at R can help in enabling
the long range BSC by utilizing the beamforming gains, we
now propose a novel backscattering protocol; see Fig. 1. Our
protocol involves estimation of the channel vector h from the
cascaded backscattered channel matrix H , h hT when N
orthogonal pilots are used for CE, one from each antenna at R.
However, when considering the availability of limited number
of orthogonal pilots, especially for N ≫ 1 or multiple readers
scenario, only first K antennas are selected to transmit K
orthogonal pilots2 . In this case with PC set to K ≤ N , h
has to be estimated from the reduced cascaded matrix HK ,
H EK ∈ CN ×K , where EK , [e1 e2 . . . eK ] represents the
N × K matrix with ones along the principal diagonal and
zeros elsewhere. Here, the standard basis vector ei is an N × 1
column vector with a one in the ith row, and zeros elsewhere.
We refer to the forward channel, R-to-T , as the downlink
(DL) and the backward channel, T -to-R, as the uplink (UL).
Assuming channel reciprocity [20], [23], the cascaded UL-DL
channel HK coefficients are estimated during the CE phase
from backscattered pilot signals, isotropically transmitted from
R. We divide each coherence interval of τ samples into two
phases: (i) the CE phase involving the isotropic K orthogonal
pilot signals transmission, and (ii) the ID phase involving MRT
to T and MRC at R using the CE obtained in the first phase.
During the CE phase of 1 ≤ τc ≤ τ samples, R transmits
K orthogonal pilots each of length τc samples from the first
K ≤ N antennas and T sets its refection coefficient to ζ0 .
This tag’s cooperation in CE can be practically implemented
as a preamble [12] for each symbol transmission. Specifically,
we assume that the tag does not instantaneously start its
desired backscattering operation, and rather remains in a state
(as characterized by ζ = ζ0 ) known to R during the CE
phase. The K orthogonal pilots can collectively represented
by a pilot signal matrix S ∈ CK×τc . With pt denoting the
average transmit power of R, the orthogonal pilot signal
matrix satisfies S SH = pKt τc IK . Without loss of generality,
we assume that τc = K, with each sample of length L in
2 As

the channel gains between the N antenna elements at R and T are
assumed to be independently and identically distributed, in general any of the
K antenna elements, not necessarily the first K ones, can be selected.

as the length of samples or symbol duration in practical BSC
implementations is greater 1.56 micorseconds (µs) [24, refer
to ISO 18000-6C standard], we use L ≥ 2µs [20]. Hence,
the total energy radiated during the CE phase is denoted by
Ec , kSk2 = pt τc . A key merit of this proposed CE protocol
is that all computations occur at R, which has the required
radio and computational resources.
IV. P ROBLEM D EFINITION
Following the discussion in Section III-B and using K
orthogonal pilots represented by S, the received signal matrix
Y ∈ CN ×K at R during the CE phase can be written as:
Y = h (A − ζ0 ) hT EK S + W = HK S0 + W,

(1)

where S0 , (A − ζ0 ) S ∈ CK×K , and W ∈ CN ×K is
the complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) matrix
with zero-mean independent and identically distributed entries
having variance N0 . We next formulate the problem of LS
estimation of the BSC channel h, based on the received
signal Y ∈ CN ×K . This estimate does not require any prior
knowledge of the statistics of the matrices H or W. Also, we
have listed the frequently-used system parameters in Table I.
A. Least-Squares Optimization Formulation

we obtain a convex problem whose solution, denoted by

with respect to h equal to
zero and solving it with respect to h. We then later via an

by solving the following optimization problem [26, eq. (4)]:

For solving OP M , let us first rewrite it in an alternate form by

yv = S0v hv + wv ,

(6)

where yv = vec {Y}, hv = vec {H EK }, S0v = vec S0 ⊗
IN , and wv = vec {W}. So, yv , hv , wv ∈ CN K×1 and S0v ∈
CN K×N K . Subsequently, using these definitions, OP M can be
rewritten in the following vectorized form [25]:

So like OP L1 , OP M1 also involves minimizing the function

novel solution methodology as outlined in the next section.
V. P ROPOSED BACKSCATTER C HANNEL E STIMATION
In this section we present a novel approach to obtain the
global minimizer of the LS problems, as defined by OPL1 and
OPM1 , to respectively obtain the desired LSE and LMMSEE
for the BSC channel vector h using K orthogonal pilots during
the CE phase. After that we discuss two special cases, where
either single pilot (i.e., K = 1) from the first antenna at R
is used, or K = N orthogonal pilots are transmitted via
N antennas at R. These two special cases, for whom the
estimates are obtained easily on substituting their respective
K values in the generic estimates as derived in Section V-A,
exhibit very simple structures and have been later shown to be
the only two possible candidates for optimal PC in Section VII.
A. Using K orthogonal Pilots for LS Channel Estimation

We can notice that (14) involves solving a system of N

is computationally very expensive if the antenna array at R is

domain representation for (14) that can be efficiently solved.
2) Equivalent Real Domain Transformation: With CE protocol involving transmission of K orthogonal pilots from the
first K antennas at R, let us denote the first K entries of h ∈

letting the real matrices Re{HE } and Im{HE } denote the

b yielding the global minimizer involves
of OP K , this LSE h
an unresolvable phase ambiguity and hence, is not unique.

Without loss of generality we have considered ‘+’ sign for h
in (26a). Moreover, as noted from the definitions for sym {·}

Notice that although we have not resolved the phase ambiguity in the estimates, defined by (27), for h, later in Section VIII-A we have numerically verified that under favorable
channel conditions this impact of phasor mismatch between
b can be practically ignored. Furthermore, a smart
h and h
selection of CE time and PC also plays a significant role
in combating the negative impact of this phase ambiguity,
as demonstrated later in Section VIII-B. Lastly, the practical
significance of these derived estimates in (27) stems from the
fact that after all the complex computations and nontrivial
transformations, we have finally reduced the whole CE process
to a simple semi-closed-form expression involving just an
eigen-decomposition of a 2K × 2K square matrix ZAK .

VI. BACKSCATTERED SNR P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS

In this section we first define the effective average achievable BSC SNR, as denoted by γ, during the ID phase. This
metric actually depends on the proposed LSE and LMMSEE
based precoder and decoder designs at R. Thereafter, we also
derive the expressions for γ under the benchmark scenarios of
perfect CSI availability and the isotropic transmission from R.
Lastly, we conclude the section by presenting a tight analytical
approximation of γ, which will be used later for obtaining the
joint optimal time allocation (TA) and PC design.
We have adopted the average effective backscattered SNR γ
as the objective function because the other conventional performance metrics [6], [14] like achievable average backscattered
throughput and bit error probability during detection are monotonic functions of this γ. So, to maximize the practical efficacy
of the proposed CE protocol for BSC, we discourse here the
smart multiantenna signal processing to be carried out at R using the derived closed-form expressions for the jointly-optimal
TA and PC design. The performance enhancement achieved in

8

terms of higher BSC range or average backscattered SNR due
to this smart selection of TA and PC during CE phase are later
numerically characterized in detail in Section VIII-C.
A. Average Backscattered SNR received at R during ID Phase

MRT to T in the DL and MRC in the UL. So, based on the

τc = 0, i.e., no CE is required, and the optimal precoder

VII. J OINT R ESOURCE O PTIMIZATION AT R EADER
This section is dedicated towards the joint optimization
study for finding the most efficient utilization of the energy
available at R for CE and ID along with the smart selection
of the orthogonal PC K for obtaining the LSE or LMMSEE
of h. We start with individually optimizing energy and PC,
before proceeding with the joint optimization in the last part.
A. Optimal Energy Allocation at Reader for CE and ID
First we focus on optimally distributing the energy at R
between the CE and ID phases. Assuming a given transmit
power, fixed at the maximum level pt and τc = KL in seconds,
we find this energy allocation by optimizing the length L of
the pilots to decide on the TA τc for the CE phase and τ − τc
for the ID phase. Next after proving the quasiconcavity of the
optimization metric γ (or γ a ) in TA τc for CE phase to enable
b L or LMMSEE h
b M , we present
efficient ID using the LSE h
a tight analytical approximation for global optimal τc .
Before proceeding with the optimal TA scheme, we would
like to highlight that the objective function γ a (cf. (43)) to
a
be maximized being non-decreasing in pt , i.e., ∂γ
∂pt ≥ 0,
is the reason behind selection of optimal power allocation
strategy of equally distributing entire power budget pt over
the transmitting antennas at R.
b L or
1) Quasiconcavity of SNR γ in τc : As the LSE h
b
LMMSEE hM cannot be obtained in closed-form due to the
involvement of eigenvalue decomposition defined in (27), we
analyze the properties of γ as a function of τc under CE
errors in an alternate way. With Ec , pt τc , from (3) we

notice that the role of τc in the CE phase is
n toobring H as

close as possible to HK (i.e., minimize Θ H in OP K ),
while leaving sufficient time (τ − τc ) for ID. So, there exists a
tradeoff between the CE quality improvement by having larger
CE time τc and spectral efficiency enhancement by leaving a
larger fraction of the coherence time dedicated for carryingout

decreasing in τc and attains its minimum (i.e., zero) only when
either Ec = pt τc → ∞ or N0 → 0. Moreover, the rate of this
decrease (i.e., improvement in CE quality) is diminishing in τc .
Since, γ, regardless of the underlying conditional distribution
b is a monotonically decreasing function of
of h for a given h,
this distance or error in CE, γ is monotonically non-decreasing
in τc , with this rate of increase with τc being non-increasing.
Combining this observation with the result in the following
lemma proves the quasiconcavity [29] of γ in τc .
Lemma 1: For a non-decreasing positive function B (x)
whose rate of increase is non-increasing, the product A (x) ,
(1 − x) B (x) is quasiconcave
in x, ∀ 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.

using the properties of B. This along with A (x) = 0 for
x = 1, completes the proof for quasiconcavity of γ in τc .
2) Analytical Approximation for Global Optimal τc : Firstly,

So, τca , τc ∂γ

for univariate functions, unimodality and quasiconcavity are
equivalent [29], and concave functions are quasiconcave also.
Hence, from τca , the total energy budget Etot , pt τ at R
can be optimally distributed between the CE and ID phases as
pt τca and pt (τ − τca ), respectively, to maximize γ in (33).
B. Optimal Orthogonal Pilots Count K during CE Phase
To find optimal PC, as denoted by Kopt , for the orthogonal
pilots to be used during CE that can yield the maximum γ a
for a given τc , we first present a key convexity property as obtained after relaxing integer constraint on K ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }.
Lemma 2: The proposed tight approximation for the average
backscattered SNR γ a is convex in integer-relaxed PC K ∈ R.
Proof: Approximated SNR γ a can also be represented as:

implies the concavity of fi in continuous K and non-increasing
convexity of fo in x. So, as the non-increasing convex transformation of a concave function is convex [30, eq. (3.10)], the
convexity of γ a in integer-relaxed PC K is hence proved.
As we intend to maximize γ a , which is convex in K under
the integer relaxation, the optimal K has to be defined by
either of the two corner points, i.e., Kopt = 1 or Kopt = N .
The latter holds because the conner points yield the maxima
for a convex function. This decision on which corner point to
be selected is based on a SNR threshold γ th as defined below:

K = 1 or for K = N .
Proposition 1: Using (48), we can make two observations:
(a) with massive antenna array (i.e., N ≫ 1) at R, Kopt = 1,
(b) for high SNR scenarios having γ E ≫ 1, Kopt = N .
Proof: (a) For the massive antenna array at R, the
definition of γ th implies that γ th ≫ 1, ∀ N ≫ 1. Therefore,
γ th > γ E , and hence, optimal K will be always 1, This
happens because with increasing N at R, the transmit power
pt
N over each antenna keeps on decreasing.
(b) On other hand for high SNR scenarios, implying γ E ≫
1, Kopt = N because γ E here is generally higher than γ th .
Below we discuss the physical interpretations behind (48).
Remark 1: The intuition for convexity of γ a in K, that
eventually resulted in its optimal value defined in (48), is
the underlying tradeoff between having larger lower-quality

samples available for CE versus to have fewer better-quality
samples. Hence, when the channel conditions are favorable,
i.e., γ E > γ th , having N 2 lower-quality samples at R during
CE due to lower transmit power pNt over each antenna for
K = N setting is preferred over having N better-quality
backscattered samples with entire transmit power budget pt
allocated to the only antenna transmitting for K = 1 case.
Remark 2: Another key insight for this nontrivial property of
b given in
the optimal PC Kopt stems from the definition for h
(26). Since, the accuracy of CE for the last N − K entries
hK̄ (cf. (26b)) depends on the quality of estimate for the
b in (31)
first K entries hK (cf. (26a)), Kopt = N when h
is accurate enough based on the underlying average SNR
γ E value during CE being greater than the threshold γ th .
Otherwise, its better to choose K = 1 over K > 1 because
this inaccuracy in estimating hK also adversely affects the
quality of the remaining N − K estimates as denoted by hK̄ .
C. Joint Energy Allocation and PC for Maximizing γ a
With transmit power set to the maximum permissible value
pt , the problem of joint energy allocation pt τc and PC K for
CE to maximize γ a can be mathematically formulated as:

As J is a combinatorial nonconvex problem, we present an
alternate methodology to obtain its joint optimal solution as
denoted by (τc,jo , Kjo ). In this regard, as from (48) the optimal
PC satisfies Kjo = 1 or Kjo = N , below we first define the
underlying optimal TA τca1 for K = 1 and τcaN for K = N :

Here, we recall that τcai < τcaN , which has also been validated
later via numerical results plotted in Figs. 9 and 12, because
more entries of HK needs to be estimated for K = N (i.e.,
N 2 entries from N × N received matrix) than for K = 1 (N
entries from N × 1 received vector). Using this information in
(48), the optimal K for J can be defined as:

Hence, the analytical expressions in (51) and (50) yield the
desired joint sub-optimal TA and PC solution for the nonconvex combinatorial problem J . These closed-form expressions
not only provide key analytical design insights, but also incur
very low computational cost at R. Extensive simulation results
have been provided in next section to validate the quality of
this proposed joint solution along with the quantification of the
achievable gains on using it over the fixed benchmark schemes.

VIII. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
Here we conduct a detailed numerical investigation to
validate the proposed estimates for the backscattered channel,
average SNR performance analysis, and the joint optimization
results. Unless explicitly stated, we have used N = 20, K =
N, τc = τc0 = 0.1ms with L = 5 µs [24], τ = 1 ms, pt = 30

dBm, a0 = 0.78 [5], a = 0.3162 [8], and β = (4πf )2 d̺ ,
where f = 915 MHz is the carrier frequency, and d = 100 m
with ̺ = 2.5 as path loss exponent. The AWGN variance is set
to N0 = kB T 10F/10 ≈ 10−20 J, where kB = 1.38 × 10−23
J/K, T = 300 K, and the noise figure is F = 7dB. All the
simulation results plotted here have been obtained numerically
after averaging over 105 independent channel realizations.
A. Validation of the Proposed CE and SNR Analysis
Here first we validate the quality of the proposed LSE and
LMMSEE for h using both K = N and K = 1 orthogonal
pilots transmission from R during the CE phase. After that
we focus on verifying the tightness of the derived closed-form
approximation γ a for the average BSC SNR γ during ID phase
which has been used for obtaining joint optimal TA and PC.

So, we notice that based on the availability of information on

CE technique and resource allocation can be decided to yield
a tight approximate for the global maximum value of γ.

notice a similar trend in the quality of h
enhanced with increasing γ id . However, the performance gap
between LMMSEE and LSE for h in terms of pr is reduced
to about −100dB for K = 1. Also, for K = 1 the pr for
the two estimates approaches to N pt β for relatively higher
SNRs values, i.e., γ id > 45dB. But in contrast, the average
receiver power pr performance at T in the low SNR regime,
i.e., −10dB ≤ γ id ≤ 10dB is better for K = 1 as sown
in Fig. 4 in comparison to that with K = N in Fig. 3. More
insights on these results are presented later in Section VIII-B2.

result verifies the accuracy of our proposed CE paradigms
for BSC as discoursed in Sections IV and V. This result is
also presented to support the preference of received power

proposed estimates, as defined in (27), are unable to resolve the
underlaying phase ambiguity (cf. (26a)), it becomes critical to
consider a performance validation metric that can also incorpob other than

the impact of phase ambiguity on performance degradation
diminishes with increasing SNR γ id values as shown in Figs. 3

2) Tightness of Proposed Approximation for γ: Now we
validate the quality of the closed-form approximation γ a
proposed in Section VI-C for the average BSC SNR γ during
ID phase. This result is important because γ a has been used
for obtaining the joint optimal TA and PC by respectively
exploiting the concavity and convexity of γ a in TA τc and
integer constraint relaxed K. So, we first consider K = N
and in Fig. 6 plot the analytical results for the backscattered
SNR γ with (a) perfect CSI (as given by γ id in (34)), (b)
LSE or LMMSEE (as given by γ a in (45)), and (c) isotropic
transmission (as given by γ is in (35)). Whereas, the simulation

results are plotted by averaging over the 105 random channel
realizations of LSE and LMMSEE based γ, as respectively
defined by γ L and γ M in Sections VI-C1 and VI-C2. The
validation results as plotted in Fig. 6 for varying BSC SNR
γ E (defined in (48)) as available during the CE phase, show
that for both low and high SNR γ E values the match between
the analytical and simulation is tight. This validates the quality
of the proposed approximation γ a with a practically acceptable
average gap between the analytical and simulation results of
less than 1.7dB in low CE SNR regime with γ E < −5dB and
less than 0.2 dB for the high SNR values γ E > 15dB available
during CE phase. Thus, only in the range −5dB < γ E < 15dB,
the match is not very tight. Further, the γ id and γ is plotted here
again corroborate the earlier results in Figs. 3 and 4 that for the
two extremes scenarios having very low γ E and very high γ E ,
the average BSC SNR γ with LSE or LMMSEE respectively
approaches the performance of isotropic transmission and as
under full beamforming gain with perfect CSI availability.
Lastly, we also verify that this approximation γ a for γ
holds tight for varying PC K. For this, we plot the variation
of analytical γ a and simulated values for γ L in Fig. 7 with
varying BSC SNR γ E values for different K values. As
believed, the analytical γ a provides a tighter match for the
simulated γ L for γ E > 0dB. The average gap between the
analytical γ a (cf. (43) or (45)) and simulated γ L results for
K = 1, K = N2 = 10, and K = N = 20 is respectively
less than 0.06dB, 0.09dB, and 0.17dB for γ E > 5dB. This
completes the validation of the qualities of proposed LSE hL ,
LMMSEE hM , and the approximation γ a . Next we use these
key analytical results for gaining the nontrivial design insights
on joint optimal energy allocation and PC for CE at R.
B. Insights on Optimal Design Parameters τca and Kopt
1) Optimal TA τc : Starting with an investigation on optimal
TA τc for LS based CE with a given PC K = N information,
we first validate the claim made in Section VII-A1 regarding
the quasiconcavity of γ (or γ L to be specific in this case)
in τc . From Fig. 8, where the variation of γ L (cf. (33))
with τc is plotted for different R-to-T distance d values,
it can be observed that γ L is quasiconcave or unimodal in
TA variable τc . Also, γ = γ L = 0 for τ = τc , and the
value of γ L at τc = 0 represents the performance under

isotropic transmission. Further, we note that the proposed
approximation τcaN (plotted as starred points in Fig. 8 and
defined in Section VII-A2) provides a very tight match to
the global optimal τc , especially in high SNR regime (as
represented by lower range d values). Moreover, as for lower
SNR scenarios, more time needs to be allocated for accurate
CE, τcaN is higher for larger BSC range d values. Also, this
investigation on optimal τc , which is < 0.5τ for practical
SNR ranges, holds even for the high carrier frequency (in GHz
range) applications with coherence time τ ≈ 100µsec.
Now we extend this investigation on optimal TA for a given
PC by presenting the variation of average BSC SNR γ M for
LMMSE based CE with increasing number of antennas N
at R in Fig. 9 for different K values. Again, we observe
that, like γ L , γ M is quasiconcave in τc . Moreover, τca closely
approximates the optimal TA τc for CE that maximizes γ M .
This optimal TA τca increases for both higher N and K
because more elements (N K elements to be precise, from an
N × K received signal matrix Y) are required to be estimated
using the same transmit power pt . Also, it is noticed that the
performance of LMMSEE with K = N and a relatively higher
optimal TA τca has a better performance than that for K = 1
with optimal TA. The latter holds because it enables to have a
b M as obtained from a relatively larger
better quality estimate h
N ×K
sized matrix Y ∈ C
with sufficiently large CE time.
2) Optimal PC K: For obtaining numerical insights on
optimal PC K = Kopt for a given or fixed TA τc = τc0 =
0.1ms as defined by (48), in Fig. 10 we plot the variation
of the average received power pr at T with PC K, denoted

as prK , normalized to the power received with single pilot,
denoted by pr1 , for varying K and γ E . It can be clearly
observed that the optimal PC Kopt is either 1 or N , i.e.,
Kopt ∈
/ {2, 3, · · · , N − 1}. Also, the average received power
at T (like average backscattered SNR γ a for ID) is unimodal
(but, convex) in K, implying that either of the two corner
points will be yielding the maximum value of pr . As with
N = 20, γ th = 3.32dB, we notice that for γ E = −5dB
and γ E = 0dB, Kopt = 1, whereas for γ E = 5dB > γ th ,
Kopt = N . This validates the claims made in Section VII-B
and (48). So, for low SNR γ E regime, when the propagation
losses are severe during the CE phase, it is better to allocate all
the transmit power pt to a single antenna and try to estimate
an N × 1 vector h from a N × 1 received signal vector (cf.
Section V-B1) rather than distributing pt across N antennas at
R for estimating it from an N × N matrix (cf. Section V-B2).
To further corroborate the above mentioned claims, we plot
the variation of the simulated backscattered SNR γ L during
ID phase for varying K and γ E in Fig. 11. A similar result
is obtained here showing that either K = 1 or K = N yields
the best performance. Further, for lower γ E , Kopt = 1 with
K = 2 performing better than both K = N2 and K = N .
Whereas as γ E increases and goes beyond 5dB, Kopt = N
and K = N2 perform better than both K = 1 and K = 2.
3) Joint optimal TA and PC: Via Fig. 12 we finally present
insights on the variation of joint optimal TA τc,jo and PC Kjo

τc = τcaN . The resulting enhancement in BSC range d for K = N =
20 while satisfying SNR requirement of γ = 10 dB is also shown.

particular, for low SNR γ E = −10dB = 0.1, Kjo = 1, ∀ N ∈
{10, 20, · · · , 150} because γ th has a value of 0.92 for N = 10,
which is higher than 0.1. Due to similar reasons, Kjo = 1 for
N ≤ 10, N ≤ 82, and N ≤ 802 respectively with γ E = 0dB,
γ E = 10dB, and γ E = 20dB. Otherwise, Kjo = N . This can
be observed from Fig. 12 in terms of the switching in τc,jo
for γ E = 0dB and γ E = 10dB. Further, τc,jo , representing the
tight approximation for optimal TA for CE, is higher for lower
γ E to have more time for CE enabling a better quality LSE
for h. Further, for both Kjo = 1 and Kjo = N , τc,jo increases
with increasing N as more elements need to be estimated using
the same training power pt . Owing to the same need, τc,jo is
higher for Kjo = N as compared to that for Kjo = 1, ∀N > 1.
C. Performance Gain and Comparisons
In this part of the results section, we quantify the enhancement in γ as achieved by optimizing the TA τc and PC K for
efficient CE. Specifically, in Fig. 13 we plot the variation of
b L and optimal TA τc = τca for
the achievable γ L with LSE h
fixed PC K = N and different BSC ranges d. The variations
of γ for isotropic radiation and directional transmission with
perfect CSI are also plotted along with the BSC using LSE
b L with fixed τc = τc = 0.1ms for comparison. The efficacy
h

of using an antenna array at R can be observed from the
fact that the BSC range d gets enhanced from 63m to 101m

instead of fixed τc = τc0 , optimized time allocation τc = τca
is considered for designing the CE and ID phases, then this
improvement in BSC range increases to 116m. Overall, the
proposed optimal time (or energy for fixed pt ) allocation
τc = τca yields an average improvement of 3 dB (two-fold
gain) in the achievable γ L with fixed TA τc = τc0 for the CE
phase with varying BSC range d from 60m to 180m.
Next we extend this result for LSE to a similar comparison
study, but now with LMMSE based CE. In particular, in
Fig. 14 we compare the achievable BSC SNR γ M performance
b M with joint optimal TA τc,jo and PC Kjo
of LMMSEE h
b M for optimal TA τca with K = N and
against that of h
b
hM with fixed TA τc = τc0 = 0.1ms and K = N . Again,
here the benchmark perfect CSI and isotropic transmission
cases are also plotted. From Fig. 14 it can be observed that
there is no gain achieved by joint optimal TA and PC over
optimal TA alone with K = N for N ≤ 8, because the
underlying γ th < γ E1 . However, for N > 8 as Kjo = 1,
γ M with K = Kjo = 1 and τc = τc,jo yields improvement
over that with τc = τca and fixed PC K = N . The average
improvement provided by LMMSEE with fixed τc = τc0 and
PC K = N is about 4.3dB in terms of γ M over the isotopic
transmission for different values of N ranging from 2 to 20.
Further, optimal TA τc = τca with fixed PC K = N can
provide an improvement of 6.7dB over fixed TA τc = τc0 .
Moreover, the joint optimal TA τc = τc,jo and PC K = Kjo
provides an additional average improvement of about 2.6dB
over optimal TA τc = τca with fixed PC K = N .
Lastly, we corroborate the utility of the proposed analysis

15

and optimization by quantifying the underlying achievable
gains in terms of the average BSC SNR γ. Specifically, via
Fig. 15 the achievable SNR γ as normalized to the maximum
value γ id achieved with perfect CSI availability for different
schemes is compared. Apart from the isotropic transmission
having average BSC SNR γ is , two fixed benchmark schemes,
namely, LSE and LMMSEE with fixed TA τc = τc0 and
PC K = N are compared against the proposed LSE and
LMMSEE with jointly optimized TA τc,jo and PC Kjo .
With increasing γ id , implying better channel conditions, the
achievable BSC SNR for each scheme, except the isotropic
transmission, increases due to the underlying enhancement in
the CE quality and approaches the value γ id achieved with
perfect CSI availability for γ id > 30dB. For the isotropic
transmission, the normalized SNR γγ is = N (N2+1) = 0.0047
id
is independent of γ id because there is no CE involved. The
LSE and LMMSEE with fixed TA and PC respectively provide
57 and 58 times more BSC SNR for ID as compared to
that with isotropic transmission. Here, the LMMSEE based
γ, as denoted by γ M , respectively provides about 14.1% and
41.3% over its LSE counterpart γ L , with and without joint
optimization. The gains achieved by the joint optimization over
the fixed TA and PC for LSE and LMMSEE are about 2.5dB
and 3dB respectively. But, for high SNR regime, LSE can
perform as good as LMMSEE both with and without optimal
TA-PC. The joint optimization is actually very important in the
practical SNR regime of 10dB to 25dB (cf. Fig. 15). Hence,
for low SNR scenarios, LMMSEE with joint optimal TAPC should be preferred. Whereas, for high SNR applications,
LSE with τc = τc,jo and K = Kjo can be adopted to avoid
complexity overhead or the need for prior information on Chv .
IX. C ONCLUDING R EMARKS
We presented a novel joint CE, energy and pilot count
allocation investigation for a full-duplex monostatic BSC setup
with a multiantenna reader R. We first obtained a robust
channel estimate yielding the global LS minimizer while
satisfying a rank-one constraint on the backscattered channel
matrix. Using the proposed principal eigenvector approximation for the equivalent real domain transformation of the LS
problem, the LMMSEE for the BSC channel is obtained while
accounting for the impact of orthogonal PC used during the
CE phase. These LSE and LMMSEE are used to design a MRT
precoder and MRC combiner at R during the ID phase. Then
exploring the concavity of the tight approximation of average
SNR γ in τc for a fixed transmit power pt and convexity
in integer relaxed PC K, it was shown that the protocol
designed using the jointly optimized TA τc = τc,jo and PC
K = Kjo nearly doubles the achievable performance with
fixed TA τc = τc0 and PC K = N . It was also proved that
the optimal PC is either given by K = 1 or K = N . Further,
we showed that LSE and LMMSEE with optimized TA and
PC should be respectively deployed for the high and low SNR
regimes. Thus, this work corroborates the significance of the
joint optimal CE and resource allocation between CE and ID
phases for maximizing the efficacy of the antenna array at R
in realizing long range QoS-aware BSC from a passive tag. In

future we would like to extend this investigation to design the
optimal training sequences for multi-tag MIMO BSC systems.
