To obtain room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors and to realize room temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) have been big challenges for a long time. Here we report that,
based on first-principles calculations, PdBr3 , PtBr3 , PdI3 and PtI3 monolayers are ferromagnetic
semiconductors that could exhibit high temperature QAHE. Curie temperatures estimated by Monte
Carlo simulations are 350 K and 375 K for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, respectively. The band
gaps of PdBr3 and PtBr3 are disclosed to be 58.7 meV and 28.1 meV with GGA and 100.8 meV and
45 meV with HSE06, respectively, being quite well in favor of observing room temperature QAHE.
It is shown that the large band gaps are induced from multi-orbital electron correlations. By carefully studying the stabilities of the above four monolayers, we unveil that they could be feasible
in experiment. The present work sheds new light on developing spintronic devices by using room
temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors, and implementing dissipationless devices by applying
room temperature QAHE.

Introduction—The realization of materials that combine semiconducting behavior and magnetism has long
been a dream of material physics. Magnetic semiconductors have been demonstrated to work at low temperatures
but not yet at high temperatures for spintronic applications. “Is it possible to create magnetic semiconductors that work at room temperature?” has been selected
as one of 125 big questions in Science [1]. The highest
Curie temperature of the most extensively studied magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As is still far below room
temperature [2]. Recent development of magnetism in
two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials has provided a new class of magnetic semiconductors with possible high Curie temperatures [3].
In 2D systems, magnetism with nontrivial topology can
induce unusual behaviors. One example is the quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), which is a quantized Hall
effect without an external magnetic field, where the combination of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and ferromagnetic ordering can generate a band gap in the bulk
and gapless chiral edge states at boundaries, and the
quantized Hall conductivity is carried by the edge states
[4–9]. Owing to the dissipationless chiral edge states,
QAHE would have potential applications in low-power
consumption spintronic devices [10]. Thus, the search
for materials with QAHE has attracted extensive interests [6, 11–15]. Inspired by the seminal work of Haldane [4], the honeycomb lattice is often thought to be
a proper platform for QAHE. Graphene with enhanced
SOC, which can be topological insulators (TI) [16–18],
may reveal QAHE by doping magnetic impurities or
through proximity effect [19–23].
Nonetheless, the QAHE in current experiments are
only realized at very low temperature. The first experimental observation of QAHE was realized in Cr-doped

(Bi,Sb)2 Te3 thin film at 30 mK [13]. Later, QAHE
was observed in V-doped (Bi,Sb)2 Te3 thin film at 25 mK
[24] and Cr/V-codoped (Bi,Sb)2 Te3 system about 300
mK [25]. So far, the highest temperature to implement
QAHE is about 2K in Cr doped (Bi,Sb)2 Te3 films [26].
In those doped TIs, magnetic disorder was found to affect dramatically the temperature in observing QAHE.
The edge states are robust against lattice disorder, but
greatly affected by magnetic disorder. To obtain a full
quantization of QAHE in magnetically doped TIs, a very
low temperature was usually employed to suppress magnetic disorders in experiments [7].
To overcome the influence of magnetic disorder, a
2D intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductor with finite
Chern number becomes a promising way to implement
QAHE. The QAHE with in-plane magnetization was discussed [27], and the QAHE at temperature of about 20
K has been recently proposed in monolayer LaCl with
in-plane magnetization [28]. For realistic applications of
QAHE, new materials with room temperature QAHE are
highly desired. Several ferromagnetic transition metal
trihalides were proposed to be candidates for the implementation of QAHE [29–33]. Among them the PdCl3
monolayer was predicted to be a promising candidate for
realizing QAHE with high temperature.
In order to find QAHE materials more feasible in experiment, we notice that the bulk PtBr3 was synthesized
and described by W öhler in 1925 [34] and the single crystals of the dark-red PtBr3 were grown in 1969 [35]. Here,
we show that, by first-principles calculations, PdBr3 and
PtBr3 monolayers with honeycomb lattice are 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors with out-of-plane magnetization, which can also implement the QAHE at quite high
temperature, where the Curie temperature TC and band
gap Eg /kB are shown higher than room temperature.

Free energy (kJ/mol)

The large band gap, opened by the spin-orbit coupling,
comes from the multi-orbital electron correlations. By
our calculations, PtBr3 and PdBr3 monolayers are shown
to have free energies and formation energies both lower
than the recently proposed PdCl3 monolayer [33], indicating that the 2D PdBr3 and PtBr3 may be promising
candidates for implementing room temperature QAHE
in experiment.
The first-principles calculations were done with the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) using the
projector augmented wave (PAW) method in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) [36, 37]. The
electron exchange-correlation functional was described
by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in
the form proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
(PBE) [38]. The structure relaxation considering both
the atomic positions and lattice vectors was performed
by the conjugate gradient (CG) scheme until the maximum force on each atom was less than 0.0001 eV/Å, and
the total energy was converged to 10−8 eV with Gaussian smearing method. To avoid unnecessary interactions between the monolayer and its periodic images, the
vacuum layer is set to 15 Å. The energy cutoff of the
plane waves was chosen as 550 eV. The Brillouin zone
(BZ)integration was sampled by using a 13 × 13 × 1 Gcentered Monkhorst-Pack grid for the calculations of relaxation and electronic structures. The phonon frequencies were calculated using a finite displacement approach
as implemented in the PHONOPY code [39], in which
a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell and a displacement of 0.01Å from
the equilibrium atomic positions are employed. SOC is
included by a second variational procedure on a fully selfconsistent basis. An effective tight-binding Hamiltonian
constructed from the maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) was used to investigate the surface states
[40, 41]. The iterative Green function method [42] was
used with the package WannierTools [43].
Results—The structure of PdBr3 (PtBr3 ) monolayer
is depicted in Fig. 1 (a), whose space group is P 3̄1m
(No.162). Each primitive cell contains two formula units
of PdBr3 (PtBr3 ) and has two Pd (Pt) atoms. Under
the crystal field of the surrounding Br octahedra, the
d orbitals of the two Pd (Pt) atoms split into threefold
t2g orbitals and twofold eg orbitals, where the latter is
energetically higher. For Pd3+ (Pt3+ ) with seven electrons in PdBr3 (PtBr3 ) monolayer, since the crystal field
is strong, six electrons will fill t2g orbitals and the remaining one will fill eg orbitals, leading to the spin S =
1/2. To confirm the stability of PdBr3 (PtBr3 ) monolayer, its phonon spectra have been calculated. There
is no imaginary frequency mode in the whole Brillouin
zone as shown in Figs. 1 (b) and (c), indicating that the
PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers are dynamically stable.
The structural stabilities of PdBr3 and PtBr3 are also
examined by the formation energy (Table I) and the free
energy (Fig. 2). The obtained negative values, Ef = -

the same level. The formation energy and free energy for
PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers lower than that for PdCl3 ,

FIG. 3. Half-ferromagnetic PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers with Curie temperatures above room temperature. (a) Total energy of PdBr3 monolayer as a function
of lattice constant for ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations. (b) Band structure of PdBr3
monolayer without inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
where the bands for spin down electrons are too far from the

(Pt) spins on honeycomb lattice: FM, Néel AFM (NAFM),
stripe AFM (SAFM), and zigzag AFM (ZAFM). (d) Temperature dependence of the normalized magnetic moment of
PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers by Monte Carlo simulations.

To determine the ground state of PdBr3 monolayer, in
the absence of SOC, we calculated the total energy for
ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations as a function of lattice constant, and found
that the FM state has an energy lower than AFM state.
The equilibrium lattice constant of PdBr3 for FM state
is a0 = 6.667 Å in Fig. 3 (a). The monolayer PtBr3
also possesses the ferromagnetic ground state, but with
a larger lattice constant a0 = 6.732 Å.
The electronic band structure without inclusion of
SOC [Fig.
3 (b)] shows that PdBr3 monolayer is a
Weyl half-metal, which acts as a conductor with only
one species of electron spin orientations at Fermi level
and at the high-symmetry point K there exists a Weyl
node protected by C3v space group. Considering the inversion symmetry, there is another Weyl point at K0 . The
total density of states (DOS) are mainly contributed by
p electrons of Br and eg electrons of Pd atoms.
In the presence of SOC, the magnetic anisotropy
should be considered. To determine the magnetic behavior of PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, we calculated
the total energy of PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers with

different possible configurations of Pd and Pt spins on
honeycomb lattice, including paramagnetic (PM), ferromagnetic (FM), Néel antiferromagnetic (NAFM), stripe
AFM (SAFM), and zigzag AFM (ZAFM) configurations,
as shown in Fig. 3 (c). The results are summarized
in Table II. One can observe that the out-of-plane FM
(FMz ) state has the lowest energy among them. We further calculated the energies for FM configurations by rotating the magnetic direction deviated from the z-axis,
and found that the FMz state is the most energetically
favorable, which shows an Ising behavior of PdBr3 monolayer.
Thus, the
Peffective Hamiltonian can be described by
Hspin = − hi,ji JSiz Sjz where J represents the nearestz
neighbor exchange integral, Si,j
is the spin operator, and
hi, ji denotes the summation over nearest neighbors. J
can be determined by the difference of energies between
ZAFMz and FMz configurations because the ZAFMz
possesses the lowest energy among those AFM configurations (see Table II), which was estimated to be 79.2
meV and 84.9 meV for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers,
respectively.
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [44] based on Ising
model were carried out to calculate the Curie temperature. The MC simulation was performed on 60×60 2D
honeycomb lattice using 106 steps for each temperature.
The magnetic moment as a function of temperature is
shown in Fig. 3 (d). It can be seen that the magnetic moment decreases rapidly to vanish at about 350
K and 375 K for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, respectively, indicating that PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers can
be potential candidates of ferromagnetic semiconductors
at room temperature.
In transition metal compounds, the d-orbitals are usually not fully filled, and the Coulomb correlation U cannot be ignored. Although the accurate values of U for
PdBr3 and PtBr3 are not known, the correlation interaction U for 4d electrons of Pd atoms in PdBr3 monolayer
should be smaller than 3 eV of the impurity Pd [45].
The correlation interaction U for 5d electrons is typically
weak and the reasonable value is usually less than 1 eV.
Thus, we take U = 2.5 eV for PdBr3 and U = 0.5 eV for
PtBr3 in calculations. The electronic band structures of

were plotted in Figs. 4 (a) and 4 (b), respectively. The
SOC opens band gaps Eg = 58.7 meV and 28.1 meV for
PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, respectively, and Eg /kB
are higher than room temperature. Because GGA usually underestimates the band gaps, HSE06 was also employed to check the band gaps. Our calculations show
that the band gaps become 100.8 meV and 45 meV with
HSE06 for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, respectively.
To investigate the topological properties of PdBr3 and
PtBr3 monolayers, we first calculated the gauge invariant Berry curvature Ωz (K) in momentum space. Topologically nontrivial band structure is characterized by a
nonzero Chern number C that counts the number of edge
states. The Chern number C obtained by integrating
the Berry curvature Ωz (K) over the BZ is 1. As expected from a nonzero Chern number, the anomalous
Hall conductivity shows a quantized charge Hall plateau
of σxy = Ce2 /h = e2 /h as shown in Figs. 4 (c) and 4
(d).
The Fermi surface of 2D materials can be adjusted
by using a gate voltage. It is intriguing to find when
the occupancy of electrons decreases by one, the Chern

number becomes -2, while the occupancy increases by
one, the Chern number is still 1. When the eg bands
are half occupied (E − EF ≈ 0.35 eV) or non-occupied
(E − EF ≈ −0.25 eV), the Chern numbers become 0.
Thus, the anomalous Hall conductivity can be tuned by
a slight shift of Fermi level for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, as shown in Figs. 4 (c) and 4 (d).
According to the bulk-edge correspondence [46], the
nonzero Chern number is closely related to the number
of nontrival chiral edge states that emerge inside the bulk
gap of a semi-infinite system. As presented in Figs. 4 (e)
and 4 (f), there is one gapless chiral edge state connecting
the valence and conduction bands.
In order to verify the stability of QAHE against the inplane strain effect, we also calculated the band structure
and Hall conductance of PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers
at different lattice constants from 5% tensile strain to
5% compression, and found that in these cases the band
gap is only changed slightly but not closed, indicating
that the QAHE in PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers is robust
against the strain effect.
Discussions—To inspect how robust is the Ising behavior of PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, with the same
method, we have calculated the magnetic anisotropy of
PtBr3 , PdBr3 , and CrI3 monolayers, where the latter
has been realized in recent experiment. The energy difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane ferromagnetic configurations is about 3.6 eV per unit cell for CrI3
monolayer [47–49], while it is 1.7 eV for PtBr3 monolayer and 7.7 eV for PdBr3 monolayer. The CrI3 monolayer has been verified to be an Ising-type ferromagnetism
with out-of-plane magnetization. The PdBr3 monolayer
should be an Ising-type ferromagnetism with stronger
anisotropy than CrI3 . To study the PtBr3 monolayer,
we take the Hamiltonian given in Ref. [50], where both
Kitaev interaction and single-ion anisotropy (SIA) were
considered, by which the Ising behavior of CrI3 [47–49]
and Heisenberg behavior of CrGeTe3 [49, 51–53] can be
interpreted. Our results show that, for PtBr3 monolayer,
both Kitaev anisotropy and SIA are numerically found
to be negative, which determines the Ising-type behavior
of PtBr3 monolayer with out-of-plane magnetization.
To check the influence of the Coulomb interaction U
on the band gaps, we have calculated the bands using
GGA+SOC+U with different values of U for PdBr3 and
PtBr3 monolayers. The results show that the band gap
changes from 61.3 meV to 56.9 meV with U in the range
of 2 eV to 3 eV for PdBr3 monolayer, and the band gap
changes from 28.1 meV to 33.7 meV with U in the range
of 0.5 eV to 1 eV for PtBr3 monolayer. In all the cases,
the semiconducting state is maintained. Note that the
typical values of U for 4d and 5d transition metals are
adopted in our paper. It is known that the GGA-type
calculation usually underestimates the band gap, and the
hybrid functional (such as HSE06) calculation can give
values approaching the experimental result. By HSE06

5
method, we found that the band gaps become 100.8 meV
and 45 meV for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers, respectively. As a result, the semiconducting states for PdBr3
and PtBr3 monolayers are robust.
The band gap is opened due to the SOC. It is known
that the SOC in Pd(4d) atom is much smaller than that
in Pt(5d) atom. However, one may see a larger band
gap for PdBr3 [Fig. 4 (a)], and a smaller band gap
for PtBr3 [Fig. 4 (b)]. To understand this puzzle, we
studied the on-site Coulomb interaction U dependence
of the band gap for PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers by the
GGA+SOC+U calculations. The band gap, which originates from SOC, increases with the on-site Coulomb interaction U . Consider the Coulomb interaction between
the orbitals with the same spin σ, which is given by
Hlz σ = (U 0 − JH )(n2 − 14 λ2SO (lz )2 σ 2 (δn)2 ), where U (U 0 )
is the on-site Coulomb repulsion within (between) the
orbitals, and JH is the Hund coupling between the orbitals. The relationship U = U 0 + 2JH [54] holds in the
atomic limit. To compensate the interaction, the band
splitting due to SOC will increase with increasing U . In
fact, the enhancement (renormalization effect) of SOC
due to Coulomb interaction U was also discussed in the
spin Hall effect in Au metal with Fe impurity [55]. The
increased U will produce the enhanced SOC, which will
induce the enhanced band gap. It turns out that the
larger band gap and larger anisotropy in 4d compound
PdBr3 mainly comes from the larger renormalization effect of SOC of Pd atom with a larger U value in PdBr3 .
The calculation on the U dependence of Curie temperature shows that when the Coulomb interaction of PdBr3
monolayer ranges from 1 eV to 3 eV, the Curie temperature changes from 310 K to 383 K, and when the Coulomb
interaction of PtBr3 monolayer ranges from 0 to 1 eV, the
Curie temperature changes from 340 K to 400 K, which
is pretty higher than room temperature, while in both
cases the QAHE preserves.
The PdI3 and PtI3 monolayers were also calculated using the same method as the above two monolayers. There
are no imaginary frequencies for PdI3 and PtI3 monolayers, indicating that they are also dynamically stable. The
stability of these two monolayers were also checked by
the formation energy (Table I) and free energy (Fig. 2).
The PdI3 and PtI3 monolayers both show the in-plane
magnetization, and the Curie temperatures can be estimated [56] to be Tc = 150 K and 164 K, respectively,
which is higher than the values of Tc in the present experiments.
Based on the 2D room temperature magnetic semiconductors with QAHE, new spintronic devices can be
designed. For example, by magnetic and spin-orbit proximity effects in bilayer junctions, it enables us to design
new functional spintronic devices and to overcome various limitations [57].
Conclusions—Based on first-principles calculations, we
report that PdBr3 and PtBr3 monolayers are room tem-

perature out-of-plane ferromagnetic semiconductors with
Curie temperatures 350 K and 375 K, respectively. Room
temperature QAHE can also be implemented in 2D
PdBr3 and PtBr3 with energy band gaps of 58.7 meV and
28.1 meV with GGA and 100.8 meV and 45 meV with
HSE06, respectively. The large band gaps come from
multi-orbital electron correlations. Here we would like to
mention that the bulk PtBr3 has been synthesized long
time ago. By paying some efforts, the experimental realization of 2D PtBr3 crystals may also be possible. Therefore, we expect that the 2D room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors PdBr3 and PtBr3 with QAHE predicted in the present work can be implemented in experiments in near future. By applying the room temperature
ferromagnetic semiconductors with QAHE, the progress
in developing spintronic devices and dissipationless devices is highly expected.
