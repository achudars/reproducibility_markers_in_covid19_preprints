Abstract
Among American women, the rate of breast cancer is only second to lung cancer. An estimated 12.4% women will develop
breast cancer over the course of their lifetime. The widespread
use of social media across the socio-economic spectrum offers
unparalleled ways to facilitate information sharing, in particular as it pertains to health. Social media is also used by many
healthcare stakeholders, ranging from government agencies to
healthcare industry, to disseminate health information and to
engage patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate people’s perceptions and attitudes relate to breast cancer, especially those that are related to physical activities, on Twitter.
To achieve this, we first identified and collected tweets related
to breast cancer; and then used topic modeling and sentiment
analysis techniques to understand discussion themes and quantify Twitter users’ perceptions and emotions w.r.t. breast cancer to answer 5 research questions.
Keywords:
social media, breast cancer, topic modeling, sentiment analysis

Introduction
A report from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) indicates that
one in eight women will develop breast cancer during the
course of her lifetime [1]. An estimated 266,120 new cases of
invasive breast cancers, and 63,960 non invasive breast cancers
will be diagnosed in 2018 in the U.S.. Among American
women, breast cancer remains the second most diagnosed
cancer, just behind lung cancer [2]. Nevertheless, a recent
study shows that physically active women have a lower risk of
breast cancer than inactive women [3]. Further, for breast
cancer surivivors, physical activities (PAs) have benefits on
their mental health, physical conditions, and movement, which
ultimatedly improve patients’ quality of life [4].
Access to care, access to adequate health information, and
health literacy largely remain to be significant issues especially
in disenfranchised populations and minorities [5], despite
improvements following the implementation of the Affordable
Care Act (ACA). However, the widespread availability and
uptake of Internet technologies across the socio-economic
spectrum has the potential to facilitate health information
sharing. Specifically, nearly 9 in 10 Americans have access to
high-speed Internet and 7 in 10 use at least one social media
platform [6]. Not only are private citizens widely using social
media resources, but the various healthcare stakeholders, e.g.
industry, governmental agencies, healthcare professionals,
have been increasingly using these online platforms to

disseminate health information, engage patients, and recruit for
clinical trials. Social media platforms provide unique sources
of essentially endless data stream, voluntarily shared by their
users. These user-generated data provide unique insights into
public health; and if mined appropriately, these data are
invaluable for understanding various social and health issues.
Twitter is a particularly relevant and effective data source to
understand how users’ perceptions and attitudes towards
health-related issues change over time. In our previous work,
we used Lynch syndrome as a case study to show that Twitter
can be used effectively to explore discussion topics, and how
promotional information can impact laypeople’s discussions
[7]. In this paper, we describe our Twitter analysis pipeline, as
it pertains to users’ general perceptions and attitudes towards
breast cancer and more specifically whether and how PAs were
discussed in these breast cancer-related tweets. We specifically
addressed the following five research questions (RQs):
• RQ1: How do people’s attitudes (i.e., emotions)
towards breast cancer change over time?
• RQ2: How do people’s attitudes towards breast cancer
differ across geospatial regions?
•

RQ3: Can we identify latent topics/themes and topic
trends in breast cancer-related tweets?

•

RQ4: How does promotional information impact
laypeople discussion themes over time?

•

RQ5: How physical activities were discussed in
laypeople’s breast cancer-related tweets?

Methods

Figure 1– The workflow of our Twitter analysis pipeline.
Our approach started with collecting tweets that are relevant to
breast cancer discussions. We then classified these tweets into
three groups (i.e., irrelevant, promotional information, and

laypeople’s discussions), assessed laypeople’s attitudes (i.e.,
emotional states) using sentiment analysis, and explored latent
themes using a topic modeling approach on both promotional
and laypeople’s tweets. Finally, based on the sentiment
analysis and topic modeling results, we addressed the 5 RQs.
Figure 1 illustrates our analysis workflow in 5 steps.
Step 1: Data collection. The data used in this study were from
two different sources: 1) we collected breast cancer tweets from
May 27, 2018 to October 13, 2018 (139 days) using a Twitter
crawler based on a set of keywords related to breast cancer (e.g.,
“breast cancer” and “#BreastCancerFighter”). The keywords
were generated through a snowball sampling process, where we
started with seed keywords (e.g., “#BreastScreening” and
“#lumpectomy”), then searched on Twitter with these keywords
to retrieve a sample of tweets, evluated the relevance of each
tweet, and identified new relevant keywords. We did this
process iterately unitl no new keywords were found; and 2) we
used the keywords developed above to identify related tweets
on a database of public random tweets, which we collected
using the Twitter steaming application programming interface
(API) from January 1, 2013 to December 30, 2017.
Step 2: Data preprocessing. We preprocessed the collected
data to eliminate tweets that were 1) duplicates across the two
sources, or 2) not in English.
To develop tweet classification models (see Step 3), we
preprocessed the tweets following the steps used by Glove [8]:
1) replaced hyperlinks (e.g., “http://t.co/xQgeMny5”) with
“<url>”, 2) replaced mentions (e.g., @Channel9”) with
“<user>”, 3) replaced hashtags (e.g.,“#breastcancer”) with
“<hastag>”, and 4) all emojis were replaced with “<emojies>”.
For sentiment analysis, we preprocessed the data with the
following steps: 1) removed hyperlinks, 2) removed mentions,
3) converted hashtags into original English words (e.g.,
converted “#breastcancer” to “breastcancer”), 3) removed all
emojies, and 4) geocoded each tweets with a geocoding tool we
developed previously [9]. For topic modeling, we lemmatized
each word and removed stop words (e.g., “this” and “is”).
Step 3: Tweet classification. Even though a tweet contains
keywords related to breast cancer, the tweet may not be relevant
to the breast cancer discussion (e.g., “I am going to write
#fiction about a 40+ year old mom with #oneboob who finds
love and life's meanings who wants to read”). Thus, we
developed a two-step process with two classification models to
categorize the massive amount of tweets into 3 groups (i.e.,
irrelevant, promotional, and laypeople’s discussions).
We first annotated 1,774 tweets randomly selected from the
overall dataset to create a training set. We then experimented
with two different deep learning algorithms: convolutional
neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).
We implemented both the CNN- and LSTM-based models in
Keras on top of the Tensorflow framework.
A common strategy for building deep learning sentence
classifiers is to use word embeddings to transform raw texts into
vectors of real numbers as features. Thus, we initialized the
embedding layer with a pretrained Twitter word embeddings
(i.e., 100 dimension) from GloVe. The same feature matrics
were used in the two-step classification process: one that
categorized tweets into relevant vs. irrelevant, and another one
that further categorized the relevant tweets into promotional
information vs. laypeople’s discussions. Models whith the best
performance were adopted to classify the rest of the tweets.
Step 4: Sentiment analysis. The Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count (LIWC) is a text analysis tool, which can assess
indivdiuals’ attitudes through counting the percentage of
emotional words used in a given text. LIWC has been used
widely and its validity and reliability were validated [10]. We

used LIWC on all laypeople’s discussions to assess their
attitudes/emotions in 5 aspects (i.e., positive emotion, negative
emotion, anxiety, anger, and sadness).
Step 5: Topic modeling. Topic modeling is a statistical,
unsupervised appraoch that can discover abstract themes in a
collection of documents. We used the Biterm algorithm to find
the main topics in all relevant tweets (i.e., combined both
promotional information and laypeople’s discussions).
Different from conventional topic modeling approaches (e.g.,
latent Dirichlet allocation) that are based on word-document cooccurrences, Biterm learns topics by modeling word-word cooccurrences patterns, which performs better on short texts [11].
Although topic modeling is a unsupervised method, the number
of topics is a parameter that needs to be determined a priori.
Based on our previous work [7], to capture as many topics as
possible, we set the number of topics as 100, visualized the
topics in wordclouds, and then manually evaluated each topic’s
quality and merged topics with similar themes.
To answer our RQs, we also need to know the topic of each
tweet. The Biterm model can infer the topic of a given tweet
and return a list of topics and associated topic probabilities. We
extracted the topic with the highest probability for each tweet.

Results
Data collection
Our data came from two different sources as shown in Table 1.
First, we collected 1,672,178 tweets using 32 breast cancerrelated keywords and the Twitter search API from May 27,
2018 to October 13, 2018. After filtering out duplicates and
non-English tweets, 1,467,783 tweets were left. Second, we
used the same list of keywords to identify relevant tweets from
a database of random public tweets we collected from January
1, 2013 to December 30, 2017. We found 257,045 tweets from
this database, within which 167,205 tweets were written in
English. Due to the different mechanisms behind the two
Twitter APIs (i.e., streaming vs. search), the volume of the
tweets from the two data sources were significantly different.
For Twitter search API, users can retrieve almost all public
tweets related to the provided keywords within 10 to 14 days
(i.e., the exact time range is not published by Twitter); while
the Twitter streaming API returns a random sample (i.e.,
roughly 1% to 20% varying acros the years) of all public tweets
at the time and covers a wide range of topics. The number of
tweets related to breast cancer in the random sample database
was expected to be low. We plot the trends of the tweet
volumes for the two sources seperatly as shown in Figure 2.

We also compared the emotion scores of laypeople’s breast
cancer discussions across states, as heatmaps in Figure 5. The
warmer the color the higher the emotion score. People in
Mississippi had the highest negative emotion and anger when
they discussed breast cancer on Twitter. Delaware had the
highest positive emotion. Hawaii had the highest sadness.
Washington D.C. had the highest anxiety.

To identify tweets related to PA from breast cancer tweets, a
list of PA keywords (n=133) were developed through a
snowball sampling process. Figure 3 shows the volume trends
of tweets related to PA in laypeople’s breast cancer discussions.
Text classification
We explored two deep learning classifiers to category the
tweets. Both CNN and LSTM have been wildly used in text
classifications and achieved state-of-the-art performance.
Table 2 shows the performance of the different classifiers and
tasks. We used 80% of the annotated data for training and the
performance was measured on the rest 20% as an independent
test data. As shown in Table 2, the CNN models outperformed
the LSTM models in both tasks (i.e., 1) relevant vs. irrelevant;
and 2) promotional information vs. laypeople’s discussions).
Thus, we adopted the CNN models as the final classifiers.

The CNN models identified 1,466,292 relevant tweets (out of
1,634,988 breast cancer related tweets). Out of the 1,466,292
relevant tweets, 961,110 are tweets with promotional
information; and 505,182 tweets are laypeople’s discussions.
Sentiment analysis
To answer RQ1 (i.e., “How do people’s emotions towards
breast cancer change over time?”), we assessed 5 emotion aspects (i.e., positive emotion, negative emotion, anxiety, anger,
and sadness) of laypeople’s breast cancer discussion tweets using LIWC. We visualized the changes of their emotion scores
across time as shown in Figure 4. The Y-axis is the emotion
scores generated by the LIWC. Even though there were fluctuations, the overall trends of negative emotion, anxiety, anger,
and sadness have been decreasing since 2013 with significant
Mann-Kendall test scores (Ptrend < .05) as shown in Table 3.

Figure 4– Laypeople’s emotion changes by time.

Figure 5– Comparsion of laypeople’s emotions towards breast
cancer issues across states.
We also analyized laypeople’s emotion changes over time by
state. California (n=30,404) and Florida (n=17,983) had the
highest number of breast cancer-related laypeople discussions,
which gave us sufficient sample sizes to detect the trends. The
trends of laypeople’s emotion changes for these two states were
decreasing as shown in Figure 6 and Table 4.

Topic modeling
To answer RQ 2-4, we used Biterm to discover the latent topics
in our data. Based on experience from our previous work [7],
we first set the number of topics to 100 to extract as many topics
as possible. We then manually reviewed the 100 topics and a
sample of assocaited tweets to assess topic quality and merge
topics with similar themes. We summarized the 100 topics into
12 topics. The results are visualized as wordclouds in Figure 7.
The topic distributions of laypeople’s discussions and
promotional information are shown in Figure 8. Laypeople
discussed more on the topics of “family”, “friend”, “diagnosis”,
“food”, and “treatment”; while they talked less about “risk” and
“mortality” compared with topics in promotional information.

To answer RQ5, we first extracted all laypeople’s breast cancer
discussions that were aslo related to physical activites (PAs,
i.e., discussions that contain PA-related keywords). We then
extarcted 100 topics using the Biterm method on these PArelated dicssuions. Similar topics were merged into one; and
two themes emerged: give support (i.e., give support to breast
cancer awareness through sporting events) and reduce risk (i.e.,
raise awareness that PAs can reduce breast cancer risks). The
wordclouds of the two themes are shown in Figure 10; and a
few example tweets for each theme are shown in Table 5.
Figure 7– 12 topics summarized from the 100 topics learned
with a Biterm topic model.

To exam the relations between promotional information and
laypeople’s discussions by topic, we used the random tweet
dataset (spanning from 2013 to 2017) and calculated the
Pearson correlation coefficient between the two (promotional
vs laypeople) based on their monthly tweet volumes for each
topic. As shown in Table 5, laypeople’s discussions had strong
correlations with promotional information on “awareness
month events”, “risk”, and “treatment” and moderate
correlations on “diagnosis”, “family”, “friend”, “news”, “pink
goods”, “screening”, and “study”. The monthly trends from
2013 to 2017 for these topics are shown in Figure 9.

Discussion and conclusions
The goals of our study were to examine breast cancer-related
discussions on Twitter and to understand people’s percetions
and attitudes towards breast cancer through their Twitter posts.
We were also interested in assessing how promotional
information impacts laypeople’s discussions on Twitter. Thus,
we used well-established text analysis approaches (i.e.,
sentiment analysis and topic modeling) on breast cancer-related
tweets to answer our five RQs.
As shown in our results (Figure 4), laypeople’s attitudes towards breast cancer changed from time to time. The overall
trends of negative affects (i.e., negative emotion, anger,
anxiety, and sadness) have been decreasing since 2013. There
have been some controversial issues being discussed on public
news outlets related to breast cancer prevention and treatments,
which might lead people think negatively. Taking the
discussions on mammography as an example, mammography is
a common way to screen for breast cancer as an early detection
method. However, many people on Twitter questioned the
effectiveness of mammography and raised concerns that it
might bring overdiagnoses and overtreatments to patients.
Nevertheless, as the negative attitudes are decreasing, it might
indicate that stakeholders such as health organizations and
agencies are doing a better job educating the public.
We also found that emotions in laypeople’s breast cancer
discussions on Twitter differ across the states. As shown in
Figure 5, people in Mississippi had significantly higher
negative emotion and anger when they discussed breast cancerrelated issues on Twitter. Neverthless, further investigations
are needed to find the reasons behind these state differences.
For example, people’s attitudes towards breast cancer maybe a
reflection of breast cacner screening rates. Mississippi is one

of the states with the lowest breast cancer screening rate
possibly due to barriers for people to access screening
programs. These barriers may lead to negative emotions
expressed in tweets (e.g., “To cure a patient's disease at the cost
of financial ruin falls short of our duty as physicians to serve”).
Laypeople’s discussions were correlated with promotional
information on a number of topics as shown in Table 5. These
strong correlations might, from another perspective, indicate
that breast cancer-related promotion strategies to raise public
awareness have been rather successful in the past few years.
Further, as observed in Figure 9, both promotional information
and laypeople’s discussions surged in October (i.e., breast
cancer awareness month) every year, which suggested that
promotional events in media (including social media) are
effective ways to gain participants and raise public’s awareness.
Such raises in awareness would ultimately lead to improved
health outcomes. For example, in early 1987, when the
American Cancer Society started to focused on raising breast
cancer awareness and before breast cancer became an official
National Health Observances (NHO) event, only 26% of
women in the U.S. had undergone a mammogram in the
previous 12 months; while by October of the same year, the
proportion had raised to 38% [12].
Over half of the women diagnosed with breast cancer gained
weight during treatment with multiple reasons [13].
Chemotherapy often leads to fluid retention, reduced PA levels
(due to pain and fatigue), decreased metabolism, and food
cravings (that can reduce nausea). Nevertheless, breast cancer
survivors should engage in a weight management program
focusing on dietary intake and PA even during treatment if
manageable. There is clear evidence that weight management
including PAs have a positive impact on mental health during
and after cancer treatment [14]. As shown in Figure 10, we
obtained two general themes from laypeople’s breast cancer
discussions that are also related to PAs: 1) people like to give
support (to breast cancer awareness through sporting events),
and 2) people are aware of the benefits of PAs that can reduce
breast cancer risks. When we looked into these tweets in more
details, we also found tweets from breast cancer survivors (e.g.,
“@raceforlife Fully intended to do this ( for the 5th year
running; pardon the pun!!) but breast cancer diagnosis and
treatment have run off with my fitness. Next year though!”),
which provides evidence data that social media might be a good
source of information to study behavioral factors such as PAs
related to improving surviorships including their quality of life
(QoS). For example, we can further understand the barriers to
adopting an exercise program among breast cancer survivors in
our future work using social media data sources.
In sum, our study demonstrated that 1) social media such as
Twitter are invaluable sources to provide insights into public
and consumer health; and 2) natural language processing
combined with machine learning are effective tools and
methods to assess laypeople’s attitudes changes in their healthrelated tweets, discover laypeople’s perceptions towards
specific health topics, and understand how promotional
informaiton has an impact on laypeople’s discussions.
