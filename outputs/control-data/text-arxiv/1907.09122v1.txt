Abstract
We extend the theory of complete minimal surfaces in R3 of finite total
curvature to the wider class of elliptic special Weingarten surfaces of finite
total curvature; in particular, we extend the seminal works of L. Jorge and
W. Meeks and R. Schoen.
Specifically, we extend the Jorge-Meeks formula relating the total curvature and the topology of the surface and we use it to classify planes
as the only elliptic special Weingarten surfaces whose total curvature is
less than 4π. Moreover, we show that a complete (connected), embedded
outside a compact set, elliptic special Weingarten surface of minimal type
in R3 of finite total curvature and two ends is rotationally symmetric; in
particular, it must be one of the rotational special catenoids described
by R. Sa Earp and E. Toubiana. This answers in the positive a question
posed in 1993 by R. Sa Earp. We also prove that the special catenoids
are the only connected non-flat special Weingarten surfaces whose total
curvature is less than 8π.

Introduction
The study of minimal surfaces goes back to Lagrange and Euler in the XIX
century and, today, is still one of the most fruitful fields in Geometric Analysis.
Among minimal surfaces in the Euclidean space R3 , those of finite total curvature, i.e., the Gaussian curvature is integrable, attracted considerable attention
in the 80’s by authors as Osserman, Chern, Costa, Jorge, Meeks or Schoen (see
[40] and references therein for a survey).
The Chern-Osserman theorem [13] asserts that such surfaces are conformally
equivalent to a closed Riemann surface of finite genus with finitely punctures
which correspond to the ends. In the seminal work of L. Jorge and W. Meeks

1

[30], the authors established their famous formula that relates the total curvature with the topology of a minimal surface in R3 of finite total curvature as
well as they studied the behavior of the ends of those surfaces; in particular,
they proved that the only complete minimal surface of finite total curvature
and one embedded end is the plane. These techniques were also used by R.
Schoen [47] to prove one of the most remarkable theorems on the classification
of minimal surfaces with finite total curvature in R3 ; the only complete (connected) minimal surface in R3 of finite total curvature and two embedded ends
is the catenoid. Moreover, the Jorge-Meeks formula and the above results also
classified the plane and the catenoid as the only complete minimal surfaces of
finite total curvature, embedded ends and total curvature less than 8π.
We focus in this paper on a wider class of surfaces in R3 that contains the
family of minimal surfaces, elliptic special Weingarten surfaces, those that verify
H = f (H 2 − K) for a certain function f ∈ C 0 ([0, +∞)) ∩ C 1 ((0, +∞)), here H
and K are the mean and Gaussian curvatures, satisfying the elliptic condition
4tf 0 (t)2 < 1 for all t ∈ (0, +∞).
Closed Weingarten surfaces in R3 were widely studied by P. Hartman and A.
Wintner [22], S. Chern [11, 12], H. Hopf [28] and R. Bryant [8] obtaining, among
others, a generalization of Hopf’s theorem and Liebmann’s theorem. In the case
of non-compact special Weingarten surfaces, some condition on the function f
at 0 and/or infinity are required in order to avoid pathological behaviors; in this
paper we will impose the natural conditions in order that rotational examples
behaving as catenoids, the special catenoids constructed by R. Sa Earp and E.
Toubiana [43, 44], do exist.
Elliptic special Weingarten surfaces lived its golden age in the 90’s thanks to
the seminal work of H. Rosenberg and R. Sa Earp [42] where they proved that
this family satisfies the maximum principle, interior and boundary, and they
can be divided into two types: constant mean curvature type if f (0) 6= 0; and
minimal type if f (0) = 0. We will focus in elliptic special Weingarten surfaces
of minimal type, in short, ESWMT-surfaces.
Sa Earp and Toubiana in a serie of papers [43, 44] constructed rotationally
symmetric examples; in particular what they called special catenoids; that behave as minimal catenoids in R3 . These examples allowed them to extend the
famous half-space theorem of Hoffman-Meeks [23] to the class of elliptic special
Weingarten surfaces of minimal type. The authors also proved that the Gaussian curvature is non-positive, and its zeroes are isolated, and the convex hull
property, all of them properties shared with minimal surfaces.
In [42], H. Rosenberg and R. Sa Earp focused on elliptic special Weingarten
surfaces of constant mean curvature type, f (0) 6= 0, which means that the sphere
of radius 1/|f (0)| belongs to this family. They were able to extend the KorevaarKusner-Meeks-Solomon theory [33, 35] for properly embedded constant mean
curvature surfaces in R3 to this class of surfaces under additional conditions
on f . When the mean curvature H and the Gaussian curvature K satisfy a
linear relation, that is, when we are considering a Weingarten relation of the
form aH + bK = c, where a, b and c are real constants, these surfaces are
called linear Weingarten surfaces, abbreviated as LW-surfaces. Rosenberg and
Sa Earp in [42] showed that if b = 1 and a, c > 0, the annular ends of a properly
embedded LW-surface converge to Delaunay ends. Others results about elliptic
special Weingarten surfaces can be consulted in [7, 20, 45, 46].
2

There was a gap of almost twenty years until J.A. Aledo, J.M. Espinar and
J.A. Gálvez, [3] extended the Korevaar-Kusner-Meeks-Solomon theory without any additional hypothesis on f . The authors also classified elliptic special
Weingarten surfaces, ESW-surfaces or f -surfaces in short, for which the Gaussian curvature K does not change sign; results analogous to those due to T.
Klotz and R. Osserman [32] for minimal surfaces. Specifically, they obtained
that, if an ESW-surface is complete with K ≥ 0 then it must be either a totally
umbilical sphere, a plane or a right circular cylinder, and, if an ESW-surface is
properly embedded with K ≤ 0, then it is a right circular cylinder or f (0) = 0,
that is, it is of minimal type. In [21], Gálvez, Martı́nez and Teruel improved
the above result in the case K ≤ 0 replacing the properly embedded hypothesis
by just completeness.
There is a lack of examples in the literature of ESW-surfaces in R3 , most of
them when the relation is linear [20, 42], for example D. Yoon and J. Lee, [53]
construct helicoidal surfaces satisfying a linear Weingarten equation; however
in the general case we only know the rotational examples constructed by R. Sa
Earp and E. Toubiana mentioned above. We hope this work will be the starting
point for fulfilling this gap in the near future.

Organization of the paper and main results
In this paper we study complete elliptic special Weingarten surfaces of minimal
type in R3 of finite total curvature.
We begin Section 1 by establishing the preliminaries results we will use all
along this paper; in particular the exact definition of elliptic especial Weingarten surface of minimal type we will consider. We will recall the results
of Sa Earp and Toubiana in [44] that characterize the rotational examples of
ESWMT-surfaces. Also, here we present the Weierstrass-Enneper representation for minimal surfaces and summarize Kenmotsu’s work [31] on the Gauss
map of immersed surfaces in R3 . We prove that an ESWMT-surface of finite
total curvature must have finite total second fundamental form. We finish this
section by defining an adapted Codazzi pair on an ESWMT-surface, which is
based on the Weingarten relation, and pointing out that this pair satisfies a
Simons type formula.
Section 2 is devoted to study the growth of the ends of an ESWMT-surface
of finite total curvature. We prove that if the Gauss map at infinity is vertical
and the end is the graph of a function defined outside some compact set in a
horizontal plane then, after a vertical translation of the end if necessary, this
function (the height function) is either positive or negative. As a consequence of
this result we obtain that there are no non-planar one ended ESWMT-surfaces
of finite total curvature in R3 . Using the Kenmotsu representation we show that
the height function is of logarithmic order, obtaining the regularity at infinity
for ends of ESWMT-surfaces of finite total curvature.
In Section 3, we present a (new?) proof of the well known Jorge-Meeks
formula for complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature using the Simons
formula. This approach and the adapted Codazzi pair defined in Section 1 allow
us to extend this result to the family of complete ESWMT-surfaces of finite total
curvature.
In Section 4, we extend the Alexandrov reflection method to unbounded
domains of catenoidal type. We use it to show that a complete ESWMT-surface
3

of finite total curvature with two ends and embedded outside a compact set must
be rotational. This fact joined with the results of Sa Earp and Toubiana give
us a Schoen type theorem for ESWMT-surfaces.
Finally, in Section 5, we use the Jorge-Meeks type formula to prove that
planes and special catenoids are the only connected ESWMT-surfaces embedded
outside a compact set whose total curvature is less than 8π.

Preliminaries

We begin this section by recovering the basic facts on ESWMT-surfaces in R3 as
well as the rotational examples given by R. Sa Earp and E. Toubiana [44]. Then,
we shall recall the Kenmotsu representation [31] necessary for the description
of the ends later on. Next, we justify the notion of finite total curvature and we
will overview the previous results on this matter we will use. Finally, we remind
the adapted Codazzi pair supported on a ESWMT-surface given in [3].
First, we will establish the notation we will use along this work. Σ will
denote a connected immersed oriented surface in R3 , possibly with boundary,
whose unit normal is denoted by N . Also, I, II, H, K, q, k1 and k2 denote the
first fundamental form, second fundamental form, mean curvature, Gaussian
curvature, skew curvature and principal curvatures respectively. Recall that
the mean, Gaussian and skew curvatures are defined in terms of the principal
curvatures as
2H = k1 + k2 , K = k1 k2 and q = H 2 − K.

1.1

Elliptic special Weingarten surfaces of minimal type

We say that an oriented immersed (connected) surface Σ is an ESWMT-surface
in R3 if the mean curvature H and Gaussian curvature K satisfy a Weingarten
relation of the form H = f (H 2 − K), where f ∈ C 0 ([0, +∞)) ∩ C 1 ((0, +∞))
verifying:


 f (0) = 0 and 4tf (t) < 1 for all t ∈ (0, +∞),

t→+∞

Remark 1. The conditions given in (1) are the natural ones, as we will see next,
for the existence of a one parameter family of rotationally symmetric examples
behaving as the family of minimal catenoids.
We will refer to the conditions in (1) as the elliptic conditions for the function
f , and in the case that f satisfies them we will say that f is an elliptic function of
minimal type. Elliptic means that the family of f -surfaces satisfies the maximum
principle (interior and boundary) [7, 42]; hence, for ESW-surfaces we are able to
apply the geometric comparison principle and the Alexandrov reflection method.
Note that trivially planes are ESWMT-surfaces for any f . Another observation to be made is that there is no closed ESWMT-surfaces in R3 by the

4

maximum principle; in fact, ESWMT-surfaces and minimal surfaces share other
properties (see [3, 43, 44]):
(i) the Gaussian curvature is non positive;
(ii) the zeros of the Gaussian curvature of a non-flat ESWMT-surface are
isolated;
(iii) a point is umbilic if, and only if, the Gaussian curvature vanishes at this
point;
(iv) a compact ESWMT-surface is contained inside the convex hull of its
boundary;
(v) planes are the only ESWMT-surfaces whose Gaussian curvature vanishes
identically.
1.1.1

Rotationally symmetric examples

As examples of ESWMT-surfaces we have all minimal surfaces, this is for the
specific case when f ≡ 0. In general, Sa Earp and Toubiana proved in [44]
the existence and uniqueness of rotational ESWMT-surfaces assuming that the
function f satisfies
lim inf
4tf 0 (t)2 < 1.
(2)
+
t→0

Remark 2. Just in this subsection, f elliptic means that 4tf 0 (t)2 < 1 for all
t > 0. At each result, we will mention the extra hypothesis that f must satisfy.
We will do this since, at the end of this subsection, we will see how our definition
adapts to the existence of special catenoids.
The first theorem about the existence of rotationally symmetric examples
says:
Theorem 1 (Existence of rotational ESWMT-surfaces, [44]). Let f be an elliptic function satisfying f (0) = 0 and (2), and let τ > 0 be a real number
satisfying
√

1
< lim
t − f (t) .
(3)
t→∞
τ
Then there exists a unique complete ESWMT-surface, Mτ , satisfying H = f (q)
such that Mτ is of revolution. Moreover, the generatrix curve is the graph of a
convex function of class C 3 , strictly positive, with τ as a global minimum, and
symmetric.
Theorem 1 determines pretty well the geometry of rotational examples of
ESWMT-surfaces. We have two cases, if the generatrix lies or not in a strip
orthogonal to the axis of revolution. In the first case, the ESWMT-surface Mτ
lies between two parallel planes and, in the second case, all coordinates functions
of Mτ are proper functions. See Figure 1.
Theorem 2 (Sa Earp-Toubiana, [44]). Let f be an elliptic function satisfying
f (0) = 0 and (2), and let τ > 0 be a real number satisfying (3). If f is Lipschitz
at 0, then the ESWMT-surface Mτ , obtained by Theorem 1, is not asymptotic
to any plane in R3 . Moreover, there exists a catenoid C such that outside of a
compact set, Mτ lies in the component of R3 \ C containing the revolution axis
of C.

Theorem 3 (Sa Earp-Toubiana, [44]). Let f be a non-negative elliptic function
satisfying f (0) = 0 and (2). If f is Lipschitz at 0 and satisfies
√

t − f (t) = +∞,
(4)
lim
t→∞

then, as τ tends to 0, the generatrix of Mτ tends to a ray orthogonal to the
rotation axis.
Remark 3. Our condition lim sup 4tf 0 (t)2 < 1 in (1) implies (4).
t→+∞

The main consequence of the last theorem is that the family of ESWMTsurfaces {Mτ : τ > 0} behaves quite similar to the family of minimal catenoids.
This means, in addition with the geometric comparison principle, that we have
a half-space theorem for ESWMT-surfaces (with the appropriate requirements
for f ). The proof of this is the same as for minimal surfaces, see [23].
Corollary 1 (Half-space theorem for ESWMT-surfaces, [44]). Let f be a nonnegative elliptic function Lipschitz at 0 satisfying f (0) = 0, (2) and (4). Let Σ be
a complete connected properly immersed ESWMT-surface verifying H = f (q).
If Σ is contained in a half space of R3 , then Σ is flat.
The uniqueness of these examples is obtained in the next theorem.
Theorem 4 (Sa Earp and Toubiana, [44]). Let f be an elliptic function satisfying f (0) = 0 and (2). If Σ is a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying H = f (q)
and rotationally symmetric, then there exists τ > 0 such that Σ is the surface
of revolution Mτ determined in Theorem 1.

Representation of surfaces in the Euclidean space
Weierstrass-Enneper representation

Let (U, x = (x, y)) be a local chart of Σ, where (x, y) are isothermal parameters
for the first fundamental form, and consider the complex parameter z = x + iy,
which is conformal, this is I = 2λ|dz|2 . It is well known that ∆x = 2HN , where
∆ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator (see [15]). This allows us to conclude that
Σ is minimal in R3 if, and only if, the coordinate functions are harmonic.
We define
(φ1 , φ2 , φ3 ) = Φ = ∂z x

and

((Φ, Φ)) = φ21 + φ22 + φ23 .

A straightforward computation shows that z is a conformal parameter if,
and only if, ((Φ, Φ)) = 0, and ∆x = 0 if, and only if, ∂z̄ Φ = 0, see [39]. Note
that the condition ∂z̄ Φ = 0 says that all the components of Φ are holomorphic,
and in this case we will say that Φ is holomorphic.
We can recover the immersion x, on simply connected domains, from Φ by
Cauchy’s theorem as
Z z

x(z) = <
Φ(w) dw ,
z0

then, in order to get locally minimal surfaces, we focus on holomorphic solutions
of the equation ((Φ, Φ)) = 0. The next lemma characterizes those solutions.
Lemma 1 (Osserman, [39]). Let U ⊂ C be a domain and g : U → C a meromorphic function. Let f : U → C be a holomorphic function having the property
that each pole of g of order m is a zero of order at least 2m. Then,


is holomorphic and satisfies ((Φ, Φ)) = 0. Conversely, every holomorphic Φ
satisfying ((Φ, Φ)) = 0 may be represented in the form (5), except for Φ =
(φ, −iφ, 0).
The lemma above implies the next theorem which gives us a local representation of minimal surfaces in R3 .
7

Theorem 5 (Weierstrass-Enneper representation). Every minimal surface immersed in R3 can be locally represented in the form

Z z
Φ(ω) dω + c
(6)
x(z) = <
0

where c is a constant in R , Φ is defined by (5), the functions (f, g) having the
properties stated in Lemma 1, the domain U being the unit disk, and the integral
being taken along an arbitrary path from the origin to the point z. The surface
x(U ) will be regular if, and only if, f vanishes only at the poles of g, and the
order of each zero is exactly twice the order of this point as pole of g.
3

Remark 4. It is easy to check that if an immersed minimal surface is represented by (6), the Gauss map is exactly the meromorphic function g.
1.2.2

Kenmotsu representation

A natural question is: can we generalize the Weierstrass-Enneper representation
for any other kind of surface? The answer is yes, we can have a representation
quite similar to the Weierstrass-Enneper one for any immersed surface in R3 ,
however, the complex functions involved in the representation may not be holomorphic. One of this kind of representations was presented by Kenmotsu in
[31].
Let Σ be an oriented surface immersed in R3 and z = x + iy be a conformal
parameter for the first fundamental form, I. We consider the smooth unit
1
normal vector field N defined by N = |∂x ∧∂
(∂x ∧ ∂y ), where ∧ is the exterior
y|
3
product in R . Consider the stereographic projection of the unit normal N =
(N1 , N2 , N3 ) from the north pole, that is,
g(z) =

N2 (z)
N1 (z)
+i
.
1 − N3 (z)
1 − N3 (z)

We will call this function, again, the Gauss map of the surface Σ. Hence,
N=

1
(g + ḡ, −i (g − ḡ) , −1 + gḡ) ,
1 + gḡ

and Nz = gz ξ¯ + ḡz ξ, where ξ is the vector field defined as
ξ=


1
1 − g 2 , i(1 + g 2 ), 2g .
(1 + gḡ)2

The tangent vector field ∂z can be obtained from the Gauss map g as
∂z = −

1
ḡz ξ,
H

(7)

and then, as in the minimal case, we can recover the immersion x, on simply
connected domains, by integration.
From (7) and the Codazzi equation we have that the Gauss map of the
immersion is a solution of the next differential equations.

8

Theorem 6 (Kenmotsu, [31]). The Gauss map g of an immersed surface Σ in
R3 must satisfy
Hgz =

H gzz̄ −

2ḡ
1 + gḡ

Q


gz gz̄ = Hz gz̄ ,

(8)
(9)

where λ is the conformal factor, Q is the (2, 0)−part of the second fundamental
form, Q = II(∂z , ∂z ), and H is the mean curvature of the immersion.
On the one hand, note that when the immersion is minimal, the Beltrami
equation (8) implies that gz̄ = 0, which means that the Gauss map is a holomorphic function; this fact was pointed by Osserman in [39]. Hence, (8) can be
seen as a generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann equations for g in the minimal
case. On the other hand, the second order differential equation (9) is a complete
integrability condition for the equation (7).
We have now all the elements to recover the immersion from the Gauss map
and the non-zero mean curvature. This means that we can have a representation
formula for immersed surfaces prescribing the mean curvature and the Gauss
map. Such representation, presented bellow, can be seen as a generalization of
the Weierstrass-Enneper formula for minimal surfaces.
Theorem 7 (Kenmotsu representation, [31]). Let Σ be a simply connected 2dimensional smooth manifold and H : Σ → R be a non-zero C 1 −function. Let
g : Σ → C ∪ {∞} be a smooth map satisfying (9) for H. Then there exists a
branched immersion x : Σ → R3 with Gauss map g and mean curvature H.
Moreover, the immersion is unique up to similarity transformations of R3 and
it can be recovered using the equation

where c is a constant in R3 and the integrals are taken along a path from a fixed
point to a variable point. Moreover, if gz̄ 6= 0, then x(Σ) is a regular surface.

1.3

Finite total curvature

A complete immersed surface Σ in R3 has finite total curvature if its Gaussian
curvature is integrable, that is,
Z
K dA < +∞.
Σ

In [38], R. Osserman showed that for minimal surfaces in R3 the total curvature is related to the distribution of the normals, specifically he proved that
if a complete minimal surface has finite total curvature, then the surface is
conformally equivalent to a compact Riemann surface with a finite number of
points removed, and the Gauss map extends to a meromorphic function in those
points. It is possible to obtain a similar Osserman’s theorem avoiding the minimal hypothesis. The topological conclusion can be deduced without the minimal
hypothesis, this was achieved by A. Huber in [29]; the second implication was
obtained by B. White in [52] assuming finite total second fundamental form and
Gaussian curvature non positive.
9

R
Theorem 8 (B. White, [52]). If Σ |II|2 dA < +∞ then Σ has finite total
curvature, in particular Σ is of finite conformal type, this is, Σ is conformally
diffeomorphic to Σ \ {p1 , . . . , pk }, where Σ is a compact Riemann surface. If
in addition K is non positive, then Σ is properly immersed and the Gauss map
extends continuously to all Σ, and any end is a multigraph over some plane.
Moreover, if an end is embedded, this end is a graph over some plane.
As mentioned above, finite total curvature does not ensure a good control
on the ends; however the ellipticity conditions (1) and finite total curvature
will imply finite total second fundamental form. Hence, by White’s theorem
(Theorem 8), we will be able to control the conformal type and ensure that the
ends are graphical.
Lemma 2. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of finite
total curvature; then it has finite total second fundamental form. Moreover,
lim

|yi |→+∞

|II| = 0,

for any proper sequence yi ∈ Σ.
Proof. From (1), since f is Lipschitz at t = 0, thereexists δ > 0 and C > 0
so that f (t) ≤ Ct for all t ∈ [0, δ]. Consider  < min δ/2, C −2 /2 , then there
√
exists 0 < c() < 1 so that f (t) ≤ c1 t for all t ∈ [0, ]; moreover c() → 0 as
 → 0.
Since 4tf 0 (t)2 < 1 for all t ∈ R+ and lim sup 4tf 0 (t)2 < 1, there exists a
t→+∞
√
√
constant c(t̄) < 1 so that f (t) ≤ f () − c(t̄)  + c(t̄) t for
√ all t ∈ [, +∞].
Finally, there exists max {c(), c(t̄)} < c̄ < 1 so that f (t) ≤ c̄ t for all t ∈ R+
0.
Let E ⊂ Σ be an end, which is conformally equivalent to a punctured disk

Let us see now that the second fundamental form goes to zero at infinity. Let
E ⊂ Σ be such an end in the conditions above;
by Theorem 8, up a rotation,

E is a multi-graph over the plane P := p ∈ R3 : hp, e3 i = 0 , where e3 =
lim N (yi ) for any sequence yi ∈ E so that |yi | → +∞; here N is the normal
i→+∞

of the surface.
Assume that there exists a sequence yi ∈ E, |yi | → +∞, so that |II| 6→ 0.
Let xi ∈ P be the points yi projected onto P . Since E is proper, up to a
subsequence, we can find δ > 0 so that the disks Di := D(xi , δ) ⊂ P are
pairwise disjoint; denote by Di ⊂ Σ the graph that projects onto Di . By abuse
of notation, we still denote by Di the translation that takes yi onto the origin.
10

If the second fundamental form does not go zero along this sequence, we would
be able to find a sequence ỹi ∈ Di so that N (ỹi ) 6→ e3 ; which contradicts that
the Gauss map extends continuously.
Remark 5. In order to prove Lemma 2, we do not need to assume that f is
non-negative in (1).
Remark 6. In [52], B. White proved that any complete surface immersed in
R3 of finite total second fundamental form has finite total curvature. This result
and Lemma 2 show that these conditions are equivalent for ESWMT-surfaces,
in the same way that they are equivalent for minimal surfaces.

1.4

Adapted Codazzi pair

A Codazzi pair on a surface is, in a few words, a pair of symmetric bilinear
forms (A, B) satisfying a Codazzi type equation being A positive definite. In
the particular case of a immersed surface in R3 , the pair (I, II) given by the
first and the second fundamental forms of the immersion is a Codazzi pair (see
[3] and references therein).
Remark 7. The results in this subsection are contained in [3] and, most of
them, only use the Weingarten relation H = f (H 2 − K). However, we will state
all the results for ESWMT-surfaces.
Consider a ESWMT-surface Σ and the pair (I, II) given by the fundamental forms of the immersion. Around any non umbilical point, or any interior
umbilical point, there exist local parameters (u, v), given by lines of curvature,
such that we are able to write
I

= Edu2 + Gdv 2 ,

II

= k1 Edu2 + k2 Gdv 2 .

In these coordinates, the Codazzi equations satisfied by the fundamental
pair are equivalent to the following equations:
(k1 )v E = −tEv and (k2 )u G = tGu ,
where t = 12 (k1 − k2 ). Note that t2 = q = H 2 − K.
Now we will use the relation H = f (H 2R− K) in order to get a new Codazzi

A quick computation shows that the mean curvature, the extrinsic curvature,
and the skew curvature of this pair are Hf = 0, Kf = −t2 = −(H 2 − K) = −q
and qf = q, respectively.
Lemma 3 (Aledo-Espinar-Gálvez, [3]). If Σ is a ESWMT-surface satisfying
H = f (H 2 − K), then (If , IIf ) is a Codazzi pair on Σ. In particular, the
(2, 0)−part of IIf is holomorphic with respect to the conformal structure given
by If .
11

The pair (If , IIf ) can be defined globally on Σ; note that at an umbilic point
If = I and IIf ≡ 0 (see [3]). It is important to note that the umbilic points of
(I, II) coincide with the umbilic points of (If , IIf ) since q = qf . Moreover, the
Codazzi pair (If , IIf ) satisfies the Simons type formula (cf. [36]):
∆If ln |IIf | = 2Kf away from the umbilic points,

(12)

where ∆If and |IIf | are the laplacian w.r.t. the metric If and the norm of IIf
respectively. Here, Kf is the Gaussian curvature of If .

Growth of an ESWMT-end of finite total curvature

By Theorem 8 and Lemma 2 we know that the embedded ends of an ESWMTsurface of finite total curvature are, outside of some compact set, graphs of
functions defined over planes orthogonal to the Gauss map at infinity. We will
prove that each of these functions cannot grow infinitely in opposite directions,
this is, after a translation of the end we can consider each function either nonnegative or non-positive. Using this fact we are able to use some results of
S. Taliaferro about the growth of a positive superharmonic function near an
isolated singularity, see [49, 50], for obtaining a Bôcher type theorem that gives
us a full description of the height function defined on a conformal parameter.
In order to describe the growth of the ends in cartesian coordinates we use the
Kenmotsu representation obtaining a kind of regularity at infinity for the ends
in the sense of Schoen [47].

2.1

The height function

Let E ⊂ Σ be an embedded end and suppose that the Gauss map goes (at this
end) to the unitary vector ν ∈ R3 at infinity. We define the plane Πν = {x ∈
R3 : hx, νi = 0}. By Theorem 8 we can write E = {x+φ(x)ν : x ∈ Πν \BΠν (R)}
for some smooth function φ : Πν \ BΠν (R) → R, where BΠν (R) = {x ∈ Πν :
||x|| ≤ R}. We denote by N : E → S2 the Gauss map and θ : E → [−1, 1] ⊂ R
the angle function defined by θ(x) = hN (x), νi for each x ∈ E. By the continuity
of the Gauss map at infinity there exists 0 <  < 1 such that 1 −  ≤ θ(x) ≤ 1
for all x ∈ E. Let ι : E → R3 be the inclusion map, then it is well known that
∆E ι = 2H, where H is the mean curvature vector of E, that is, H = HN , H
the mean curvature and ∆E the Laplacian operator on E. Multiplying by ν
this identity we get ∆E hι, νi = 2Hθ, and abusing notation we write hι, νi = φ
and ∆E φ = 2Hθ.
By Huber’s theorem [29] the end E is conformally equivalent to the punctured disk D∗ , that is, there exists a diffeomorphism α : D∗ → E such that the
metrics g0 and g1 = α∗ g are pointwise conformal. Here we are denoting as g0 and
g, the flat metric in D∗ and the Euclidean metric restricted to E, respectively.
It follows that there exists a smooth positive function λ : D∗ → R such that we
can write g1 = λg0 , and, after a straightforward computation, ∆g1 = λ−1 ∆g0 .
Define the function u : D∗ → R by u(z) = hα(z), νi, due to the fact that α is an
isometry from (D∗ , g1 ) onto (E, g) we have that ∆g1 u = (∆E hι, νi) ◦ α; joining
this with the relation between the Laplacians and the expression obtained for
12

∆E φ we achieve
∆g0 u = 2λHθ.

(13)

We think on the function u as the height of the end E, over the plane Πν , given
by the conformal immersion α : D∗ → E, see Figure 3.

Figure 3: Parametrizing the end E with a conformal parameter.
The first claim about the height function u of an end E is that, after a
vertical translation of the end E, either u ≥ 0 or u ≤ 0. This means that
the end E cannot grow infinitely in both directions ν and −ν simultaneously.
Specifically, we are going to prove the follow lemma.
Lemma 4 (Growth lemma). Let E be an embedded end of an immersed ESWMTsurface Σ. Suppose there exists R > 0 such that E is obtained as the graph of
a C 2 class function φ defined in R2 \ B(R). Suppose also that |∇φ| → 0 as
r → ∞, where r is the distance from an arbitrary point to the origin. Then at
least one of the quantities inf φ(x, y) or sup φ(x, y) is finite.
|(x,y)|≥R

|(x,y)|≥R

Remark 8. In order to prove Lemma 4, we only need to impose that the elliptic
function f satisfies 4tf 0 (t) < 1 for all t ∈ (0, +∞) and f (0) = 0; that is, we do
not need to impose all the conditions on (1).
The proof presented here is based principally on the work of H. Chan [9, 10],
S. Bernstein [6] and E. Hopf [25], and it is based in several lemmas that we are
going to introduce.
Consider a circle γ contained in the domain of φ. Let Pγ denote the linear
function that best approximates the function φ on the circle γ in the supremum
norm. If we define
(
)
m(γ) =
then m(γ) =

inf

a,b,c∈R

sup |φ(x, y) − (ax + by + c)| ,

(14)

(x,y)∈γ

sup |φ(x, y) − Pγ (x, y)|. Note that m(γ) = 0 if, and only if,
(x,y)∈γ

{φ(x, y) : (x, y) ∈ γ} is a planar curve.
The next lemma, under the hypothesis that φ is not linear, guaranties the
existence of a circle such that its best approximating plane is not horizontal.
Lemma 5 (Chan-Treibergs, [10]). If φ is not a linear function, there exists a
circle γ0 surrounding ∂B(R) such that m(γ0 ) 6= 0 and ∇Pγ0 6= 0.
13

The Tchebychev equioscillation theorem, see [1, p. 57], says that if a polynomial of degree n is the best approximation of a function defined on a compact
interval, in the supremum norm, then there exist at least n + 2 ordered points
on the interval where this distance is attained and the polynomial oscillates
around the function. There is a special version of the Tchebychev equioscillation theorem for periodic functions approximated by trigonometric functions,
see [1, pp. 64–65]. This version immediately guaranties the following lemma.
Lemma 6. For any circle γ contained in the domain of φ, there exist at least
four points, ordered as, β1+ , β1− , β2+ , β2− along γ, such that for i = 1, 2 we have
φ(βi+ ) = Pγ (βi+ ) + m(γ) and φ(βi− ) = Pγ (βi− ) − m(γ).
This lemma means that on the circle γ the function φ−Pγ alternates between
m(γ) and −m(γ) at the points βi± , see Figure 4.

Figure 4: The Tchebychev theorem.
The next lemma is due to S. Bernstein and it was used by him to prove the
famous Bernstein’s theorem about entire minimal graphs.
Lemma 7 (Bernstein, [6]). Let φ be of class C 2 in a connected open set Ω and
let φxx φyy − φ2xy ≤ 0 in Ω. Assume φ > 0 in Ω and φ = 0 on ∂Ω. Suppose that
Ω can be placed in a sector of angle less than π. Let M (r) be the maximum of φ
on the part of the circle of radius r, centered at some fixed point, contained in Ω.
Then there exist a positive constant c such that M (r) > cr for all r sufficiently
large.
The original proof of Bernstein of his theorem contained a gap. E. Hopf
[26] proved a topological lemma, which is the key to fulfill the gap detected in
Bernstein’s work. This lemma is also important in the proof of our result and
it reads as follows.
Lemma 8 (Hopf, [26]). If Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded open set and Ω0 ⊂ Ω is a
connected open subset whose boundary has at least one point in common with
∂Ω, then the set ∂Σ ∩ ∂Σ0 of all of these common boundary points contains a
set accessible from within Ω. If ∂Σ ∩ ∂Σ0 is the union of two disjoint closed sets
then each of these sets contains a set accessible from within Ω.
Proof of the growth lemma. The Gaussian curvature K of E is then given by
K=

φxx φyy − φ2xy
,
(1 + φ2x + φ2y )2
14

therefore the function φ satisfies φxx φyy − φ2xy ≤ 0. If K vanishes identically,
then E is contained in a plane and, hence, φ is linear. From the hypothesis on the
gradient of φ, we conclude that φ ≡ 0, and the lemma is proven. Consequently
we will consider that K does not vanish identically.
Now, assume that
inf

|(x,y)|≥R

φ(x, y) = −∞ and

sup

φ(x, y) = ∞,

(15)

|(x,y)|≥R

with the purpose of obtaining a contradiction.
Claim A. The function φ has sublinear growth.
Proof of Claim A. For r ≥ R, let γ(r) be the circle centered at the origin and
radius r, m(r) and M (r) be the minimum and the maximum value of φ on γ(r)
respectively. Taking r large enough, (15) implies that
m(r) < min {0, m(R)} and M (r) > max {0, M (R)} .
By Lemma 6, there exist ordered points p1 , q1 , p2 , q2 in γ(r) such that φ(p1 ) =
m(r), φ(p2 ) = M (r) and φ(q1 ) = φ(q2 ) = 0. By the mean value theorem, there
exist points w1 , w2 in γ(r) such that
−m(r) = |φ(p1 ) − φ(q1 )| ≤ πr|∇φ(w1 )|,
M (r) = |φ(p2 ) − φ(q2 )| ≤ πr|∇φ(w2 )|.
Thus, for any p in γ(r), we have
−r(r) ≤ −πr|∇φ(w1 )| ≤ m(r) ≤ φ(p) ≤ M (r) ≤ πr|∇φ(w2 )| ≤ r(r),

max |∇φ|.
π γ(r)
To obtain a non-increasing function (r) and the strict inequality it is sufficient to change (r) by sup{(r̄) : r̄ ≥ r} + r12 ; this proves Claim A.
where (r) =

From now on, we redefine R, if necessary, in order to argue that the function
φ has sublinear growth in R2 \ B(R).
According to Lemma 5, there exists a circle γ0 of radius r0 > R winding
around ∂B(R) such that m(γ0 ) 6= 0 and |∇Pγ0 | 6= 0. After a translation and a
rotation in the domain of φ, we can assume that the center of γ0 is the origin
and Pγ0 (x, y) = q0 y with q0 > 0. We would like to emphasize that all points of
the set {φ(x, y) : (x, y) ∈ γ0 } are interior points of the end E. Let B denote
the set obtained after the translation and rotation above of B(R).
We define the function ψ(x, y) = φ(x, y) − Pγ0 (x, y) for any (x, y) ∈ R2 \ B.
2
Note that ψxx ψyy − ψxy
≤ 0. From Lemma 6 there exist four points, ordered as
+
−
+
−
β1 , β1 , β2 , β2 along γ0 , such that
ψ(β1+ ) = ψ(β2+ ) = m(γ0 ) > 0 and ψ(β1− ) = ψ(β2− ) = −m(γ0 ) < 0.
Let r̄ > r0 large enough such that (r) < q0 for all r ≥ r̄. We define the
subset G of R2 as

Let us analyze the set G in each quadrant of R2 . On the first quadrant, using po(r)
lar coordinates, the equation |y| = r(r)
q0 becomes sin θ = q0 . Therefore outside
B(r̄), for each r ≥ r̄, there is a unique θ satisfying the last equation, moreover,
since (r)
q0 is non-increasing, the curve determined by the initial equation is a
graph over the x−line (outside B(r̄)), see Figure 5.

We must observe that ∂G is symmetric with respect the x-axis and y-axis.

Figure 6: The set G.
We have obtained that the set G is bounded by two curves L+ and L− .
The curve L− is the union of the curves solution to |y| = r(r)
q0 in the first and
the second quadrants and the arc of ∂B(r̄) (in these quadrants) joining these
curves. This arc can be described as the set of points (x, y) ∈ ∂B(r̄) such that
+
−
y ≥ r̄(r̄)
q0 , see the left side of Figure 5 . The curve L is the reflection of L
with respect to the x−axis. A sketch of the set G is presented in the Figure 6.
On the one hand, any (x, y) ∈ L− satisfies either y = r(r)
or y ≥ r̄(r̄)
q0
q0 .
Therefore on L− either ψ(x, y) = φ(x, y)−q0 y = φ(x, y)−r(r) < 0 or |(x, y)| = r̄
and ψ(x, y) = φ(x, y) − q0 y ≤ φ(x, y) − r̄(r̄) < 0. Thus, the function ψ is
negative on L− . Analogously we can prove that ψ is positive on L+ . On the
other hand, any point (x, y) above the curve L− satisfies y > r(r)
q0 , then we can
conclude that ψ(x, y) = φ(x, y) − q0 y < r(r) − r(r) = 0. In the same way, any
point (x, y) below the curve L+ satisfies ψ(x, y) > 0.
This shows that the set {(x, y) ∈ R2 \ B : ψ(x, y) = 0} must be strictly
contained in G. Clearly this set is not empty since ψ alternates between −m(γ0 )
16

and m(γ0 ) on ∂B(r0 ). Let us denote the sets
Ω+ = {(x, y) ∈ R2 \ B(r0 ) : ψ(x, y) > m(γ0 )},
−

(16)

2

Ω = {(x, y) ∈ R \ B(r0 ) : ψ(x, y) < −m(γ0 )}.
Claim B. Neither Ω+ nor Ω− is empty.
Proof of Claim B. Suppose that the set Ω+ is empty; then ψ(x, y) ≤ m(γ0 )
for all (x, y) ∈ R2 \ B(r0 ). Recalling that ψ(x, y) = φ(x, y) − q0 y we infer
that φ(x, y) ≤ q0 y + m(γ0 ), this means that the end E is placed below the
plane q0 y + m(γ0 ) which is above the plane parallel to Pγ0 at distance m(γ0 ),
see Figure 7. The intersection between the end and the plane has no interior
points of the end, by the geometric comparison principle. Consequently, the
intersection occurs only on ∂B(r̄) and this intersection is transversal, again by
the geometric comparison principle. Moreover, as r → ∞, the distance between
the end E and the plane q0 y + m(γ0 ) goes to infinity since the function φ has
sublinear growth and the Gauss map goes to ν at infinity. Now we can decrease
the inclination of the plane keeping the end E below until we obtain either an
interior first contact point between the end and some plane, or a horizontal
plane such that E is below of this plane, see Figure 8. The first case cannot
happen, by the geometric comparison principle, and the second case contradicts
the assumption (15). Analogously, the statement Ω− = ∅ contradicts that E
grows also infinitely in the direction −ν. This proves Claim B.

Claim C. Each component of Ω+ and Ω− is unbounded.

17

Proof of Claim C. Suppose that a component of Ω+ is bounded; geometrically
this means that the part of the end E, corresponding to that component, above
the plane q0 y + m(γ0 ) is compact. Hence for a positive constant c the plane
q0 y+m(γ0 )+c and the end E have an interior contact point, again the geometric
comparison principle leads to a contradiction. Analogously for the components
of Ω− . This proves Claim C.
Claim D. Each set Ω+ and Ω− has at least two connected unbounded components.
Proof of Claim D. Each component of the sets Ω+ and Ω− is unbounded by
Claim C. Note that β1+ , β2+ ∈ Ω+ and β1− , β2− ∈ Ω− . Let us denote by Ω±
i the

connected component of Ω± such that βi± ∈ ∂Ω±

can connect the points β1+ and β2+ by a curve contained in Ω+

moreover,

we can connect these points also by a line segment contained in B(r0 ); these
curves enclose a compact set containing either β1− or β2− , hence one of the sets
−
Ω−
i is contained in this compact set, thus Ωi is empty, since all components
−
are unbounded, see Figure 9. Interchanging the roles of Ω+
i and Ωi , we obtain
a similar conclusion. Then, it is enough to prove that all the sets Ω±
i are not
empty. Suppose that Ω+

∅.
In
this
case,
the
end
E,
in
a
neighborhood

of φ(β1+ ), is below the plane q0 y + m(γ0 ). This situation is avoided by the
geometric comparison principle. The same argument is valid for the other sets.
This proves Claim D.

Proof of Claim E. If any of the sets Ω0 i contains a point of L± , then by the
connectedness it must contain the whole curve L± . In this case the curve L±
satisfies the condition required.
±
Now suppose that some set Ω0 i does not touch the curve L± , this implies
0±
that Ω i ⊂ G \ B(r0 ). We now add the points +∞ and −∞ to the boundary of
±
G and consider again the set Ω±
i , then clearly ∂G ∩ ∂Ωi ⊂ {−∞, +∞}. Assume
that +∞ is not in the common boundary,
thereby there exists a large enough

(r)
easily find an angle less than π where the set Ω±
i can be placed, since q0 → 0
as r → ∞; Figure 10 shows how to build the angle sector.
Applying Lemma 7 to the function ψ − m(γ0 ) on the set Ω±
i , we obtain that
for r big enough and some (x, y) with |(x, y)| = r we have
ψ(x, y) − m(γ0 ) > cr.
However, φ has sublinear growth on Ω±

ψ(x, y) − m(γ0 ) = φ(x, y) − q0 y − m(γ0 )
≤ r(r) + q0 |y| − m(γ0 )
≤ 2r(r) − m(γ0 ),

To finish the proof of the growth lemma, consider for i = 1, 2 a curve in

points βi− , and, in consequence, they must enclose one of the sets Ω−

a contradiction because now −∞ is not accessible from within Ω−

As a consequence of the growth lemma we have an obstruction for nonplanar one ended ESWMT-surfaces with finite total curvature in R3 . This is an
evidence about the premise that the theory of ESWMT-surfaces is quite similar
to the theory of minimal surfaces, even more if we note that there is not such
obstruction for harmonic surfaces of finite total curvature, see [14].
Theorem 9. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete connected ESWMT-surface satisfying
(1) of finite total curvature and one embedded end. Then Σ is a plane.
Proof. Since Σ has finite total curvature, Lemma 2 says that Σ has finite total
second fundamental form. Then, Theorem 8 and the growth lemma (Lemma
4) imply that Σ lies in a half-space of R3 . Thus, by the half-space theorem,
Corollary 1, Σ is a plane.

2.2

Logarithmic growth

The second claim about the height function u : D∗ → R of an embedded
ESWMT-end E satisfying (1) of finite total curvature is that this function is
asymptotically radial as |z| → 0+ and has logarithmic growth.
The function u satisfies the Poisson equation (13), which can be written as
∆u = 2λθf (q) provided the Weingarten relation H = f (q). Henceforth, we will
consider that u ≥ 0, hence u and ∆u have the same sign, by the growth lemma
and the conditions (1). Note that the case of u ≤ 0 is completely analogous
since we can redefine ν as −ν, this will change the sign of the angle function θ
and we will have the same conclusion.
In a neighborhood of 0 we obtain that
∆u = 2λθf (q) ≤ 4δλθq = δλθ(|II|2 − 2K),

(17)

for some positive constant δ.
Recalling that θ ≤ 1, Lemma 2 and integrating around the origin, we conclude, redefining the end E if necessary, that

The desired conclusions about the function u are obtained from (17), (18)
and the next Lemma.
20

Lemma 9 (S. Taliaferro, [49]). Let u and ϕ be non-negative functions defined
on D∗ , such that ∆u = ϕ in D∗ and ϕ is integrable over the whole disk D. Then,
there exists a constant β and some continuous function uh : D → R, which is
harmonic in D, such that for any z ∈ D∗ we have
u(z) = β log |z| + uh (z) + uN (z),
where the function uN is the Newtonian potential of ϕ and is defined by

The behavior of the Newtonian potential of ϕ near the singularity can be
described as follow.
Lemma 10 (S. Taliaferro, [51]). Let u and ϕ as in Lemma 9. If there exists a
non-negative constant C and 0 < r ≤ 1 such that ϕ(z) ≤ (2|z|)−C for z ∈ D(r)∗ ,
then the Newtonian potential of ϕ satisfies

as |z| → 0.

As we have pointed out above in Lemma 2, the mean curvature H goes to
0 as |z| → 0. Then given a non-negative constant C and a positive constant
A, for |z| small enough, we can assume that H(z) ≤ 2−C+1 A−1 . Therefore, by
recalling that the angle function is bounded above by 1, from (13) we get
1
λ,
(22)
2C A
where λ is the conformal factor of the metric.
Now, in order to estimate λ, we have the following theorem that is an easy
consequence of several theorems proven by R. Finn, see [17, 18].
∆u ≤

Theorem 10 (R. Finn, [18]). Let Σ be a complete Riemannian surface of finite
total curvature in a neighborhood E of one of its ideal boundary components.
Suppose that the region of positive curvature has compact support on the surface.
Then E can be mapped conformally onto the punctured disk D∗ in the complex
plane. Let denote by λ|dz|2 the conformal metric. Then there exist constants A

Therefore, using last theorem and (22), we conclude that for |z| small enough
∆u ≤ (2|z|)−C , where C = max{0, 2Φ0 }. This allows us to use Lemma 10 in
our geometric context and infer that

The Beltrami equation and quasiconformal maps

The Gauss map g of an immersed surface in R3 satisfies a very rich partial differential equation, the Beltrami equation. In general this equation can be written
as
gz̄ = µgz .
(24)
Although there is a variety of equivalent definitions for a quasiconformal
map, here we will consider the definition based on the Beltrami equation. This
definition is taken from [19, p. 47].
21

Definition 1. Let D ⊂ C be a domain. The function g : D → C is called a
quasiconformal map if it is a homeomorphic solution of the Beltrami equation
(24) with ||µ||∞ < 1.
Given a quasiconformal map g, at points z ∈ D where g is differentiable we
define the value
Γµ (z) =

1 + |µ(z)|
= lim
1 − |µ(z)| r→0+

max |g(z) − g(w)|

|w−z|=r

min |g(z) − g(w)|

.

|w−z|=r

This value is called the dilatation of g at z. The maximal dilatation of g is
defined as Γg = sup Γµ (z) and it satisfies
z∈D

Γg =

1 + ||µ||∞
.
1 − ||µ||∞

(25)

It is very common to find the notation Γg -quasiconformal to indicate a quasiconformal map g with maximal dilatation Γg or parameter of quasiconformality
Γg , see for example [2].
Note that 1-quasiconformal maps are exactly the conformal maps because
Γg = 1 only when µ = 0 which means, from the Beltrami equation, that gz̄ = 0,
i.e., g is holomorphic. This is precisely what happens when the function g is the
Gauss map of a minimal immersion. In this case we say that g is antiholomorphic
since we usually construct g by sterographic projection from (0, 0, 1).
A posthumous paper by A. Mori [37] studies quasiconformal maps from the
unit ball into itself such that the origin is fixed. The main result of this paper
is known nowadays as the Mori theorem and it establishes a Hölder condition
for the function g.
Theorem 11 (Mori theorem). Let g : D → D be a Γg -quasiconformal map with
g(0) = 0. Then
|g(z) − g(w)| ≤ 16|z − w|1/Γg ,
(26)
for all z, w ∈ D. Furthermore, the constant 16 in (26) cannot be replaced by any
smaller constant independent of Γg .
Let us go back to our geometric context, where g is the Gauss map of an
ESWMT-surface of finite total curvature. According to Theorem 6, the Gauss
map satisfies the Beltrami equation with µ = Hλ
Q . Using the Weingarten relation
H = f (q) we conclude that
f (q)
|µ| = √ .
q
We can assert, since f is Lipschitz at t = 0, that
f (t)

(27)

hence, since q → 0 at infinity, ||µ||∞ ≤ σ < 1; for some non-negative constant

Summarizing, we have proven the Gauss map of an embedded ESWMT-end
satisfying (1) is a Γg -quasiconformal map, where the parameter of quasiconformality satisfies

Γg ≤

In order to use Mori’s theorem, we are going to distinguish for a moment
between the Gauss map obtained by the stereographic projection from (0, 0, −1)
and (0, 0, 1) writing g for the first case (as it was being) and % for the second
one. Then we have that %(0) = 0 and, by Mori’s theorem, % satisfies for all
z ∈ D that
1−σ
|%(z)| ≤ 16|z| 1+σ .
This means that %(z) = O (|z| ) as |z| → 0, where 1 ≥  =
g %̄ = 1 we deduce that

g(z) = O |z|− as |z| → 0.

sup {|µ| : D∗ (r)} → 0 as r → 0+ .
Then, following the computations above, the parameter of quasiconformality
in D∗ (r), denoted by Γg (r), satisfies
Γg (r) → 1 as r → 0+ ,
therefore, (28) can be rewritten as

Regularity at infinity for ESWMT-surfaces

Let E be an embedded end of an ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of finite total
curvature. According to Theorem 8, E can be described as a graph of a real
valued function φ defined on the complement of a compact set in a plane, which is
orthogonal to the limit of the Gauss map at infinity. We would like to understand
the asymptotic behaviour of this function as in the case of minimal surfaces
[47]. Until now, we have described the end E by a conformal parametrization
α : D∗ → E such that the function u = hα, νi is determined by (19) and satisfies
u(z) = O (log |z|) as |z| → 0.
By Lemma 9 we know that the function uh is harmonic on D. Using an
homogeneous expansion for the function uh at 0 ∈ D, see [5, p. 100], and Lemma
10, we can rewrite (19) for any z = x + iy ∈ D∗ as



1
as |z| → 0, (30)
u(z) = β log |z| + a0 + a1 x + a2 y + O |z|2 + o log
|z|
for some real constants β, a0 , a1 , a2 . Here, we have used that there are only two
linearly independent homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree m in two
dimensions, namely, the real and the imaginary part of z m .
In order to establish an easy notation, we will assume that the Gauss map
takes the value ν = (0, 0, 1) at infinity and the function φ is defined on the
23

complement of a compact subset of R2 = {(x1 , x2 , 0) : x1 , x2 ∈ R} ⊂ R3 . Note
that with this convention the function u is the third coordinate function of E;
naming x1 and x2 the other coordinates of the diffeomorphism α we can write
α = (x1 , x2 , u). From this, it is clear that the functions u and φ are essentially
the same, in fact φ(x1 , x2 ) = u(z(x1 , x2 )). In order to know how the parameter
z depends of x1 and x2 we will use the Kenmotsu representation, Theorem 7,
to recover the coordinate functions x1 and x2 in terms of z.
From (7) we have the following equations
ḡz (1 + g 2 )
,
H(1 + gḡ)2
iḡz (1 − g 2 )
,
∂z x2 = −
H(1 + gḡ)2
2ḡz g
∂z u = −
.
H(1 + gḡ)2
∂z x1 = −

Hence we conclude that ∂z (x1 + ix2 ) = −g∂z u and we can recover x1 + ix2 by
integration from the Kenmotsu representation.

Since u(z) = O(log |z|) as |z| → 0 by (23), we have that ∂z u(z) = O |z|−1
as |z| → 0. On the other hand,
from the ellipticity of the function f , we

have (29), i.e., g(z) = O |z|−1 as |z| → 0+ . We reach upon integration that
x1 + ix2 = O |z|−1 as |z| → 0. Defining r = |x1 + ix2 |, we have that |z| =
O r−1 as r → +∞. Again, rewriting the function u, from the equation (30),
we achieve the following description of the asymptotic behavior of the function
φ,

φ(x1 , x2 ) = β log r + a0 + 2 + 2 + O r−2 + o (log r) as r → +∞,
r
r
for some real constants β, a0 , a1 , a2 (not necessarily the same constants of (30)).
Summarizing all the results achieved in this section, we get
Theorem 12. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of finite
total curvature and embedded ends. Then each end Ei is the graph of a function
φi over the exterior of a bounded region in some plane Πi . Moreover, if x1 , x2
are the coordinates in Πi , then the function φi have the following asymptotic
behaviour for r = |x1 + ix2 | large

φi (x1 , x2 ) = β log r + a0 + 2 + 2 + O r−2 + o (log r) ,

where β, a0 , a1 , a2 are real constants depending on i.
Theorem 12 implies that, if the planes Πνi are not parallel, then the ends
must intersect. In particular, when the surface Σ is embedded outside a compact
set and has two ends, we have that these ends can be described as graphs of
functions defined over the same plane Π. Moreover, the surface Σ must grow
infinitely in both sides of the plane Π, since it cannot be contained in a halfspace by the half-space theorem, Corollary 1. Recall that the vectors νi are the
continuous extension of the Gauss map to the ideal boundary {pi }, Theorem 8.
When the vectors νi are parallel, we will say that the corresponding ends Ei are
parallel.
We summarize this fact in the next lemma.

Lemma 11. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of finite

We would like to finish this section by noting that the equality (31) can be
seen as a generalization of the concept of regular at infinity given by Schoen in
[47].

Jorge-Meeks type formula

Here, we will extend the famous Jorge-Meeks formula for complete minimal
surfaces of finite total curvature. In fact, we will give first a proof by using the
Simons formula for minimal surfaces. As far as we know, this approach was not
known:
Theorem 13 (Jorge-Meeks formula). Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete minimal surface of finite total curvature of genus g and k embedded ends, then
Z
K dA = 4π(1 − g − k).
Σ

Proof. Since Σ has finite total curvature, it is conformally equivalent to a compact surface of genus g, Σg , with k points removed.
Let Di∗ (r), i = 1, . . . , k, be punctured conformal disks pairwise disjoint corresponding to the ends. Since the ends are embedded, the first fundamental form
is asymptotic to ci |z − pi |−4 |dz|2 , where z is a complex coordinate in Di∗ (r) and
ci is a positive constant. The positive constant ci can be computed as


(32)
lim r2 A Di (r0 ) \ Di (r) = πci ;
r→0

where A(Ω) denote the area of Ω ⊂ Σ measured with respect to I.
Let Q be the Hopf differential, since K → 0 as p → pi , then Q(pi ) = 0 for all
i = 1, . . . , k; observe here that the Hopf differential extends meromorphically to
the ends.
The umbilic points are isolated and K < 0 on each Di hence, there is only a
finite number, {x1 , . . . , xm }, of umbilic points at the interior. Consider Dj (r),
25

j = 1, . . . , m, geodesic disks of radius r centered at xj , j = 1, . . . , m, pairwise
disjoints.
Sk
Sm
Set Σr = Σ \ i=1 Di (r)∗ ∪ j=1 Dj (r); then the Simons formula reads as
∆ ln |II| = 2K in Σr ,
then, integrating in both sides of the above equality and using the divergence
theorem we get

where ν is the inward normal along either Di∗ (r) or Dj (r).
Consider z a local conformal parameter on Dj (r), then we can write |II| =
|Q|/λ, where I = λ|dz|2 . Since the conformal factor λ is regular at xj , j =
1, . . . , m, then
Z
h∇ ln |II|, νi dA → −2πOrdxj Q as r → 0,
Dj (r)

where Ordxj Q is the order of the zero (or pole) of the Hopf differential at xj .
Consider z a local conformal parameter on Di∗ (r), then we can write |II| =
|Q|/λ, where I = λ|dz|2 . Since the conformal factor λ is asymptotic to ci |z −
pi |−4 at pi , i = 1, . . . , k, then
Z
h∇ ln |II|, νi dA → −2πOrdpi Q − 8π as r → 0,
Di∗ (r)

where Ordpi Q is the order of the zero (or pole) of the Hopf differential at pi .
By the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem the sum of the order of the zeroes and
poles of the Hopf differential is −2χ(Σg ) = −4(1 − g). Therefore, joining all the
above information we get
Z
K dA = 4π(1 − g − k),
Σ

as desired.
Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of finite total
curvature and embedded ends. Then, by the results described in Section 1.4,
the adapted Codazzi pair (If , IIf ) satisfies that If is a complete metric on Σ
since q → 0 at infinity.
Since Σ has finite total curvature; it is conformally equivalent with respect
to the conformal structure given by the first fundamental form I to a compact
Riemann surface minus a finite number of punctures pi , i = 1, . . . , k. Let Di∗ (r)
be a punctured conformal disk with respect to the conformal structure given by
I around pi , consider r > 0 small enough so that the punctured disks Di∗ (r) are
pairwise disjoint. From (11) and the fact that q → 0 at infinity; there exists a
constant C(r) ≥ 1 so that
C(r)−1 If ≤ I ≤ C(r)If on Di∗ (r),

26

where the constant C(r) satisfies C(r) → 1 as r → 0. This means that Di∗ (r) is
also conformally equivalent to a punctured disk with respect to the conformal
structure given by If ; or, in other words, I and If are isometric at infinity.
Moreover, the area element of I, dA, is pointwise equal to the area element of
If , dAf ; the last statement is general and it follows from (11).
Also, there exists a holomorphic (with respect to the conformal structure of
If ) quadratic differential, denoted by Qf , whose zeroes coincide with the umbilic
points of Σ. Moreover, since I and If are isometric at infinity, the conformal
factor associated to If at a punctured pi is asymptotic to ci |z −pi |−4 |dz|2 , where
z is a complex coordinate in Di∗ (r) with respect to the conformal structure given
by If around pi , and ci is the positive constant given by (32); the last statement
follows by the fact that the area elements, dA and dAf , coincide pointwise; that
is,


(33)
lim r2 Af Di (r0 ) \ Di (r) = πci ;
r→0

where Af (Ω) denote the area of Ω ⊂ Σ measured with respect to If . Also, the
quadratic differential extends meromorphically to the punctures as above.
Therefore, using
Sk the Simons
Smtype formula given in Section 1.4, integrating
over Σr = Σ \ i=1 Di (r)∗ ∪ j=1 Dj (r) and following the exact same computations as above, we obtain that:
Z
Kf dA = 4π(1 − g − k).
Σ

Since (Σ, I) and (Σ, If ) are complete, finitely connected and their respective
total curvature are finite, K. Shiohama (cf. [48, Theorem A] or [34, Proposition
1.2]) proved that

Remark 9. We shall say that there is a mistake in the formula given in [48,
Theorem A]; the 2 should be in the numerator instead of the denominator in
the expression A(t)

formula we have used here. We can verify it by taking the simple example of R2
with the flat metric.

Alexandrov reflection method for catenoidal
type ends

A. Alexandrov [4] characterized spheres as the only closed connected surfaces
embedded in R3 with constant (non-zero) mean curvature. Although this is a
major theorem, the procedure introduced by Alexandrov have had a remarkable
impact in the development of Differential Geometry. This technique is called
the Alexandrov reflection method and it is based on the maximum principle,
the classical result on the theory of second order elliptic partial differential
equations, see [24, 27, 41].
Theorem 15 (Interior maximum principle). Let u be a C 2 (Ω) function which
satisfies the differential inequality Lu ≥ 0 in the domain Ω, where L is a locally
uniformly elliptic operator. If u takes a maximum value C in Ω, then u ≡ C in
Ω.
The interior maximum principle does not apply when the function u attains
its maximum value at the boundary of the domain Ω. The following theorem,
known as Hopf’s lemma, treats this case.
Theorem 16 (Boundary maximum principle). Let u be a C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 0 (Ω) function which satisfies the differential inequality Lu ≥ 0 in the domain Ω, where
L is a locally uniformly elliptic operator. Suppose that Ω satisfies the interior
sphere condition and let x0 ∈ ∂Ω such that
(i) u is of class C 1 in x0 .
(ii) u(x0 ) ≥ u(x) for all x ∈ Ω.
(iii) ∂ν u(x0 ) ≥ 0, where ν is the inward normal direction of ∂Ω.
Then u is constant.

4.1

The Alexandrov reflection method

Alexandrov’s idea to prove his theorem, roughly speaking, was to compare the
surface with successive reflections of parts of the surface looking for a possible
first tangency point, and finding at this time a plane of symmetry for the original
surface. With the aim of applying this method later we are going to present the
Alexandrov reflection method following [3, 16, 33], which is a generalization to
non-compact surfaces.
Definition 2. Let Σ1 and Σ2 be immersed surfaces in R3 and p ∈ Σ1 ∩ Σ2 .
The point p is called a tangent point if Tp Σ1 = Tp Σ2 , and either p is an interior
point of both surfaces or p ∈ ∂Σ1 ∩ ∂Σ2 and the interior conormals vectors of
∂Σ1 and ∂Σ2 coincide at p.
28

Given a surface Σ immersed in R3 and p ∈ Σ, we can describe locally the
surface Σ, in a neighborhood of p, as a graph of a smooth function defined on its
tangent plane at p, thinking of this linear space as an affine plane of R3 passing
through p. That is, there exists a neighborhood V ⊂ Σ of p, a domain Ω ⊂ Tp Σ
and a smooth function u : Ω → R such that
Σ ∩ V = Gr (u) = {q + u(q)N (p) : q ∈ Ω},
where N is a unit normal vector field defined on Σ. Note that u(p) = 0. When
the surface Σ has no empty boundary and p ∈ ∂Σ, the function u is defined on
Ω̄, p ∈ ∂Ω and u(∂Ω) = ∂Σ ∩ V .
Note that when the surfaces Σ1 and Σ2 have a common tangency point p (at
the interior or at the boundary), then locally those surfaces can be obtained as
graphs (over the same plane) of functions u1 and u2 respectively, defined on the
same domain (Ω or Ω̄ according if either p is an interior or a boundary point
respectively).
Let us denote by Σ1 ≥p Σ2 if Σ1 and Σ2 have the point p as a common
tangency point and u1 ≥ u2 in a neighborhood of p in Ω (or Ω̄), which means
geometrically that locally the surface Σ1 is above the surface Σ2 around p.
Now we state a geometric maximum principle using the functions that locally
describe the surfaces.
Definition 3. Let Σ1 and Σ2 be surfaces immersed in R3 . We say that the
surfaces satisfy the maximum principle if, for every common tangent point p ∈
Σ1 ∩ Σ2 , the function w = u2 − u1 satisfies a differential inequality Lw ≥ 0 for
some locally uniformly elliptic second order partial differential operator L and,
in addition, the conditions in the hypothesis of Theorem 16 when the tangent
point is at the common boundary of the surfaces. Here ui is the function such
that Σi is locally, around p, represented as the graph of ui , for i = 1, 2.
The intention of the last definition is to apply Theorem 15 and Theorem 16
thinking just in the geometric fact that two surfaces are touching tangentially
to each other. Hence, using Definition 3 and the theorems mentioned we obtain
the following geometric comparison principle:
Theorem 17 (Geometric comparison principle). Let Σ1 and Σ2 be surfaces
immersed in R3 satisfying the maximum principle. If Σ1 ≥p Σ2 then Σ1 = Σ2
locally around p.
It is common to work with families of surfaces satisfying the maximum principle, see for example [3, 16].
Definition 4. Let F be a family of oriented immersed surfaces in R3 . We say
that F satisfies the maximum principle if the following properties are fulfilled:
(i) F is invariant under isometries of R3 .
e is another surface contained in Σ, then Σ
e ∈ F.
(ii) If Σ ∈ F and Σ
(iii) Any two surfaces in F satisfy the maximum principle, in the sense of
Definition 3.

29

As examples of families of surfaces satisfying the maximum principle we
would like to mention the family of minimal surfaces and the family of surfaces
with non-zero constant mean curvature. In both cases, they achieve the conditions of Definition 4 mainly because the equation H = c, where c is a constant
(c = 0 for the case of minimal surfaces), gives a quasilinear elliptic equation
when the surface is written as a graph. Although these families come from
a similar equation they are quite different; for example there are no compact
minimal surfaces while the sphere of radius 1c is the unique compact embedded
surface of constant mean curvature c (Alexandrov Theorem).
Let Σ be a connected properly embedded surface in R3 , then the surface
divides R3 into two connected components. Let us denote by N a unit normal
vector field globally defined on Σ. Set C(N ) the component of R3 \ Σ pointed
by N . Note that ∂C(N ) = Σ.
Consider a fixed plane P ⊂ R3 with normal unit vector n. For t ∈ R we will
denote by Pt the parallel plane to P at signed distance t, that is, Pt = P + tn.
Hence, the family {Pt }t∈R is a foliation of R3 by parallel planes to P. Set Pt−
and Pt+ the closed half spaces, lower and upper respectively, from the plane Pt ,
i.e.,
[
[
Pt− =
Ps and Pt+ =
Ps .
s≤t

s≥t

For any set G ⊂ R , let Gt+ be the portion of G above the plane Pt and let G∗t+
be the reflection of this portion through the plane Pt , then we can write
3

Gt+ = G ∩ Pt+

and G∗t+ = {p + (t − r)n : p ∈ P, p + (t + r)n ∈ G}. (35)

We define analogously the sets Gt− and G∗t− .
Given an open set W ⊂ C(N ) consider the portion S of the surface Σ obtained by S = ∂W ∩ Σ. If the set St+ is not empty and St∗+ ⊂ W̄ we write
St∗+ ≥ St− , which means that the reflection of the set St+ thought the plane Pt
is above the set St− , considering the height from the plane P.
When S is not empty, we will define a function Λ1 , called Alexandrov function associated to S.
We start with the definition of the domain of the function Λ1 . Given a point
p ∈ P, set Lp the perpendicular line to P passing through p, therefore we can
parametrize this line as Lp = {p + tn : t ∈ R}. Suppose that Lp ∩ W̄ 6= ∅ but
Lp is disjoint from W̄ for all sufficiently large t, that is, there exists a value
t1 (p) such that p + tn ∈
/ W̄ for any t > t1 (p) and P1 (p) = p + t1 (p)n ∈ W̄ .
We say that P1 (p) is the first point of contact of the set Lp ∩ W̄ as t decreases
from +∞. Now we are going to suppose additionally that P1 (p) ∈ S, then the
intersection of Lp and S can be either tangential or else transversal. In the first
case we will denote P2 (p) = P1 (p) and t2 (p) = t1 (p). When the intersection is
transversal, we are going to look for the next point where Lp tries to leave W̄ ,
if exists, that is, we look for a point P2 (p) = p + t2 (p)n such that p + tn ∈ W̄
for any t1 (p) ≥ t ≥ t2 (p) and P2 (p) ∈ S. We say that P2 (p) is the second point
of contact of the set Lp ∩ W̄ as t decreases from +∞.
Let us denote by D the domain of the Alexandrov function associated to
S and define it as the set of points p ∈ P such that either there exists just a
first contact point or there exist the first and second contact points of the set
Lp ∩ W̄ as t decreases from +∞, and those points belongs to S. Geometrically,
D contains all points p in the plane P such that the lines Lp , coming from
30

infinity, enter W̄ through S either tangentially or transversally and leaving W̄
also through S.
We define Λ1 : D → {−∞} ∪ R the Alexandrov function associated to S by
(
t1 (p) + t2 (p)
, if there exist P1 (p) and P2 (p),
Λ1 (p) =
(36)
2
−∞,
if there exists just P1 (p).
When Λ1 is finite, note that Λ1 (p) is the value such that the reflection of
the point P1 (p) through the plane PΛ1 (p) is P2 (p). When Λ1 (p) = −∞, the
reflection of P1 (p) through the plane Pt , for all t < t1 (p), is contained in W .
Definition 5. A point p ∈ D is called a local interior maximum for Λ1 if
there exists a neighborhood U of p in P such that for any q ∈ U either q ∈ D,
P1 (q), P2 (q) ∈
/ ∂S and Λ1 (q) ≤ Λ1 (p), or else Lq ∩ W̄ = ∅. Any other local
maximum of Λ1 will be called a local boundary maximum.
Definition 6. A first local point of reflection for S with respect to the plane
P with normal n is defined to be a point P2 (p) such that p ∈ D and is a local
maximum of Λ1 , that is, there exists a neighborhood U of p in P such that
Λ1 (q) ≤ Λ1 (p) for any q ∈ U ∩ D.
The above definitions are justified through the next lemma which shows that
the Alexandrov reflection method can be applied to non-compact surfaces.
Lemma 12 (Alexandrov reflection method). Let F be a family that satisfies the
maximum principle and Σ ∈ F be a connected surface. Let P be a plane in R3
with normal n. If, relative to the subsets S ⊂ Σ and W ⊂ C(N ), the Alexandrov
function Λ1 has a local interior maximum value t0 at p ∈ D, then the plane Pt0
is a plane of symmetry for Σ.
Proof. We are going to compare the surface S with the reflection St∗+ of St+
0
0
through the plane Pt0 , keeping in mind the fact that S and St∗0 are surfaces in
F. Since Λ1 (p) = t0 we get that P1 (p) reflects to P2 (p). The local maximality
hypothesis implies that there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ P of p such that any
q ∈ U verifies that either q ∈ D, P1 (q), P2 (q) ∈
/ ∂S and Λ1 (q) ≤ Λ1 (p), or else
Lq ∩ W̄ = ∅. Note that in the second case we have that Lq ∩ S = ∅, thus we can
assume q ∈ D. Using the definition of the Alexandrov function (36) we get
t2 (q) ≤ t0 − (t1 (q) − t0 ).

(37)

Looking at (35), we infer that inequality (37) means that the reflection of P1 (q)
through the plane Pt0 lies above the point P2 (q) and then P1 (q)∗ ∈ W̄ . Summarizing, a neighborhood of St∗+ containing P2 (p) is contained in W̄ .
0
We have shown that St∗0 ≥P2 (p) S or equivalently Σ∗t0 ≥P2 (p) Σ; in particular
P2 (p) is an interior tangent point when P1 (p) 6= P2 (p) and a boundary tangent
point when P1 (p) = P2 (p). By Theorem 17, we conclude that Σ = Σ∗t0 , thus
Pt0 is a plane of symmetry of Σ.
The Alexandrov reflection method is very useful any time we get a local
interior maximum for the Alexandrov function. Although the function Λ1 is not
continuous in general, it is upper semicontinuous and it will attain its supremum
in any compact domain.
The next lemma shows that the Alexandrov function Λ1 is upper semicontinuous with respect to planes as well as points.
31

Lemma 13. Let S be a closed surface and a parameter ε → 0. Suppose that
there exists a sequence of points pε → p and a sequence of planes P ε → P
such that pε ∈ P ε and p ∈ P. Let Λε1 and Λ1 be the corresponding Alexandrov
functions. If Λε1 (pε ) and Λ1 (p) exist, then
lim sup Λε1 (pε ) ≤ Λ1 (p).

(38)

ε→0

Proof. Assuming Λε1 (pε ) exists for ε → 0, then there is a sequence (P1 (pε ), P2 (pε ))
of pair of points of S for  → 0. Since S is closed, a subsequence of this sequence
converges to a pair of points of S, possibly identical, (Q1 , Q2 ). Note that clearly
Q1 , Q2 ∈ Lp since Lpε → Lp . We call t1 and t2 the height of these points above
P.
The values t1 (pε ) and t2 (pε ) converge to the height of Q1 and Q2 above P,
respectively. By definition of first and second contact points we conclude that
the points P1 (p) and P2 (p) must be at least as hight as the points Q1 and Q2
2
and (38) is
respectively, that is, t1 (p) ≥ t1 and t2 (p) ≥ t2 . Hence Λ1 (p) ≥ t1 +t

verified.
As a first application of the Alexandrov reflection method on ESWMTsurfaces we have.
Theorem 18. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of
finite total curvature, two ends and embedded outside a compact set. Then, Σ
is embedded and it has a plane of horizontal symmetry.
Proof. Let K ⊂ R3 be a compact set so that Σ \ K is embedded. By the results
in Section 2, Lemma 4, Theorem 12 and Lemma 11, each end Ei ; i = 1, 2, is
a graph over some plane with logarithmic growth, even more, both ends are
graphical over the same plane. Without lost of generality, we can assume that
such plane is the horizontal plane H := {x3 = 0}.
Moreover, without lost of generality, we can assume that the growths βi given
in Theorem 12 are different from zero; otherwise the half-space theorem, Corollary 1, implies that Σ is a plane; contradicting that Σ has two ends. Moreover,
we can assume that E1 ⊂ {x3 > 0} and β1 ≤ β2 .
Let p ∈ Σ be the highest point in the x3 −direction so that the normal at
p, N (p), is horizontal. This point clearly exists since N goes uniformly to the
vertical vector ±e3 at infinity. Up to a vertical translation, we can assume
that p ∈ Σ ∩ H. Consider Σ+ = Σ ∩ {x3 > 0}, then Σ+ is a multi-graph since
hN, e3 i =
6 0 on Σ+ and it is a graph close to infinity by hypothesis; therefore
Σ+ is a graph over H.
Let H(s) be the parallel plane to H at height s > 0; that is, H(s) :=
{x3 = s}. Define Σ̃(s) as the reflection of Σ ∩ {x3 > 0} with respect to the
plane H(s). Since β1 ≤ β, Σ̃(s) ∩ (Σ ∩ {x3 < s}) = ∅ for s big enough. Now,
we can decrease s from infinity to zero and, by the growth condition β1 ≤ β2 ,
the first accident must occur at a finite point, which means that Σ has a plane
of horizontal symmetry by the maximum principle. If we achieve s = 0, since
at p the normal is horizontal, again the maximum principle implies that Σ
has a plane of horizontal symmetry; that is, Σ consists of two graphs over H,
symmetric to each other with common boundary a closed curve in H. This
proves the theorem.

4.2

The Alexandrov function and tilted planes

In this subsection we are going to prove that, given an end E of an ESWMTsurface as a graph of a function of the form (31) and an orthogonal plane P,
the maximum value of the Alexandrov function Λ1 of E respect to the plane P
is achieved at ∂E.
Set ν := lim|yi |→+∞ N (yi ), for any proper sequence yi ∈E. Without loss of
generality, we can assume that ν = (0, 0, 1) and ∂E ⊂ Πν := p ∈ R3 : hp, νi = 0
since we can translate vertically the end E and also redefining the end cutting
off the compact part that is at one side of the plane Πν after the translation.
Besides, we can also consider that the function φ, given in Theorem 12, is nonnegative, after a reflection through the plane Πν , if necessary.
Let W be the connected component of the upper half-space of Πν that contains on its boundary the bounded domain limited by E∩Πν . Consider a vertical
plane P containing the vector ν = (0, 0, 1) and the height function respect to
the plane Πν defined by h(p) = hp, νi. We define the associated Alexandrov
function Λ : [0, ∞) → {−∞} ∪ R on E (with respect to P) as
Λ(ρ) = max {Λ1 (p) : p ∈ D, h(p) = ρ},

(39)

where D is the domain of the Alexandrov function Λ1 , (36), associated to E
(with respect to P).
By Theorem 12, for any ρ ≥ 0, the level set Eρ = {q ∈ E : h(q) = ρ} is
a non-empty compact set. Then the function Λ is finite valued, since the set
{p ∈ D : h(p) = ρ} is non-empty and compact. This situation changes severely
if we tilt the plane P slightly. We will study the consequences, on the associated
Alexandrov function, caused by the tilting.
Let n be the normal vector of the plane P and consider the vectors ν ε = ν+εn
and nε = n − εν for a small ε > 0. Note that hν ε , nε i = 0. We will define the
tilted planes Πν ε = {p ∈ R3 : hp, ν ε i = 0} and P ε being the plane passing
through the origin with normal vector nε . The height function from the plane
Πν ε is hε defined by hε (p) = hp, ν ε i. Clearly P ε → P, Πν ε → Πν , and hε → h
as ε → 0.
Since the end E has logarithmic growth, we will obtain two important facts
when ε > 0 is small. The first one is that the height function hε restricted to
Dε must attain a minimum value hε0 . The second one is that the Alexandrov
function Λε1 is valued as −∞ outside a non-empty compact set of Dε . More
precisely:
Lemma 14. Let ε > 0. There exists a non-empty compact set Ω ⊂ P ε such
that for any p ∈ Dε ∩ (P ε \ Ω) there exists just first contact point of the set
{p + tnε : t ∈ R} ∩ W̄ as t decreases from +∞, i.e., Λε1 (p) = −∞.
Proof. We are going to prove this lemma in the case that n = (1, 0, 0). This
is sufficient, since the expansion for the function φ in Theorem 12 is invariant
under rotation of the (x1 , x2 )-coordinates. Let us consider a new coordinate
system for R3 defined by
(y1 , y2 , y3 ) = (x1 − εx3 , x2 , x3 + εx1 ).

(40)

Using these coordinates we get the planes P ε = {(y1 , y2 , y3 ) ∈ R3 : y1 = 0} and
Πν ε = {(y1 , y2 , y3 ) ∈ R3 : y3 = 0}. The intersection of the end E with the plane

ER be the set of points in E such that r ≤ R, i.e.,
q
ER = {(x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ E : r = x21 + x22 ≤ R}.

Note that ER is a non-empty compact set, since it is the graph of a continuous
function defined over a compact set. Let ρ be the maximum value of the function
hε on the set ER , then for τ > ρ we have that all points of Γτ satisfy r > R.
On the other hand, without any assumption on τ , if (y1 , y2 , τ ) ∈ Γτ satisfies
|y2 | > R, then r > R. Summarizing, by (41), if (y1 , y2 , τ ) ∈ Γτ is a point
∂Φ
(y1 , y2 ) > 0. This means that
satisfying either τ > ρ or |y2 | > R, then ∂y
1
if τ > ρ, the entire curve Γτ , in the (y1 , y2 )-plane is the graph of a function
defined in the variable y2 and, consequently, (in the (y1 , y2 , y3 )-coordinates) for
all y2 ∈ R, the line {(t, y2 , τ ) ∈ R3 : t ∈ R} intersects the end E exactly once.
We have the same conclusion in the case that |y2 | > R, but only on the part of
the curve satisfying the hypothesis. We define the non-empty compact set
Ω = {(0, y2 , y3 ) ∈ P ε : |y2 | ≤ R and hε0 ≤ y3 ≤ ρ}.
Thus, if p ∈ Dε ∩ (P ε \ Ω), then Λε1 (p) = −∞.
Let us define the sets D0ε = {p ∈ Dε : hε (p) = hε0 }, E0ε = {p ∈ E : hε (p) ≥
and W0ε = {p ∈ W : hε (p) ≥ hε0 }, see Figure 13.

Lemma 15. For the end E (with all the assumptions made in this section) and
any vertical plane P containing ν = (0, 0, 1), either the function Λ is strictly
decreasing, or else Σ has a plane of reflection parallel to P.
Proof. We will begin proving that the function Λ is non-increasing. For this it
suffices to show that Λ(ρ) ≤ Λ(0) for all ρ > 0, since we can translate vertically
E and redefine the end to choose the level ρ = 0 arbitrarily.
Recall that W = C(N ) ∩ {p ∈ R3 : h(p) ≥ 0}. We claim:
Claim A. Λ(ρ) ≤ Λ(0) for all ρ > 0 if, and only if,
Et∗+ ∩ {p ∈ R3 : h(p) > ρ} ⊂ W̄ for all t > Λ(0).

Figure 13: The Alexandrov function Λ1 is valued as −∞ outside of a compact
set.
Proof Claim A. If Λ(ρ) ≤ Λ(0) for all ρ > 0, then for an arbitrary t > Λ(0) we
have that Λ(ρ) ≤ t for all ρ > 0. By the definition of the Alexandrov function,
we infer that Et∗+ ∩ {p ∈ R3 : h(p) > ρ} ⊂ W̄ .
If Et∗+ ∩ {p ∈ R3 : h(p) > ρ} ⊂ W̄ for all t > Λ(0), we will show that
Λ(ρ) ≤ Λ(0) for all ρ > 0 reasoning by contradiction. Suppose there exist
ρ0 > 0 and p ∈ D such that h(p) = ρ0 and
Λ1 (p) = Λ(ρ0 ) > Λ(0).
Considering t = Λ(ρ0 ) we have that if any neighborhood of Et∗+ containing the
reflection of the point P1 (p) through the plane Pt , where contained in W̄ , the
maximum principle would yield that Pt is a plane of symmetry for Σ (as in the
proof of Lemma 12). But this is impossible since Λ(0) 6= t. This proves Claim
A.
To prove that Et∗+ ∩ {p ∈ R3 : h(p) > ρ} ⊂ W̄ for all t > Λ(0) we will use
tilted planes and Lemma 13.
The semicontinuity of the Alexandrov function, Lemma 13 and Lemma 14
imply that the maximum value of the function Λε1 must be achieved at some
point at the compact set Dε ∩ Ω, where Ω is the set obtained from Lemma 14.
We are going to prove that the height of this point from the plane Πν ε is exactly
hε0 .
Claim B. The function Λε1 must attain its maximum at some point in D0ε .
Proof Claim B. Suppose that the function Λε1 attains its maximum value t at
some point q ∈ Dε ∩ Ω. Note that if p ∈ Dε ∩ (P ε \ B) and P1 (p) ∈ Et+
then, by Lemma 14, the reflection, P1 (p)∗ , of P1 (p) through the plane Ptε is in
W̄0ε . Then we just have to pay attention on the points p ∈ Dε ∩ Ω when we
reflect through the plane Ptε . Suppose that hε (q) > hε0 , then the points P1 (q)
and P2 (q) are far away from ∂E0ε , i.e., q is either an interior tangent point or
a boundary tangent point, see Figure 14. In any case, by Lemma 12, the set
E0ε has a plane of symmetry parallel to P ε , which is a contradiction, thereby
q ∈ D0ε . This proves Claim B.

Figure 14: Λε1 attains its maximum value t at q ∈ Dε ∩ Ω such that hε (q) > hε0 .
Writing z ε for the maximum value of Λε1 , it follows that
(E0ε )∗t+ ⊂ W̄0ε for all t ≥ z ε .

(42)

By letting ε → 0, from (42) we get
Et∗+ ⊂ W̄ for all t ≥ lim sup z ε .

(43)

ε→0

The semicontinuity of the Alexandrov function, Lemma 13, and Claim B imply
that
lim sup z ε ≤ Λ(0).
ε→0

Given t ≥ Λ(0), then t ≥ lim sup z ε by the inequality above, thus (43) says that
ε→0

Et∗+ ∩ {p ∈ R3 : h(p) > ρ} ⊂ W̄ .
Hence, using Claim A, we have proven that the function Λ is non-increasing.
To finish the proof of the lemma, note that the function Λ is either strictly
decreasing or constant in some interval. In the second case, the Alexandrov
function Λ1 has a local interior maximum and Lemma 12 determines the existence of a plane of symmetry parallel to P.

4.3

A Schoen type theorem for ESWMT-surfaces

In this section we will establish a Schoen type theorem for ESWMT-surfaces.
Theorem 19. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete connected ESWMT-surface satisfying
(1) of finite total curvature, two ends and embedded outside a compact set. Then
Σ must be rotationally symmetric. In fact, there exists τ > 0 such that Σ is the
surface of revolution Mτ determined by Sa Earp and Toubiana in [44].
Proof. Let E1 and E2 be the ends of Σ. By Lemma 11 we know that E1 and
E2 are parallel ends and Σ grows infinitely in opposite directions. On the other
hand by Theorem 18 we have that Σ is embedded.
Let ν be the continuous extension of the Gauss map of one of the ends
(observe that the Gauss map goes to −ν at the other end) and P a plane
containing ν; up to a rigid motion we can assume ν = (0, 0, 1) and P is a
36

vertical plane. In order to apply Lemma 15 we will consider the Alexandrov
functions associated to each end E1 and E2 (with respect to P) denoted by
Λ1 and Λ2 respectively. Then either both of these Alexandrov functions are
strictly decreasing or at least one of the ends has a plane of symmetry parallel
to P. In the second case it is clear that the geometric comparison principle,
Theorem 17, implies that Σ has a plane of symmetry parallel to P. For the first
case we will consider the Alexandrov function associated to the entire surface
Σ. This function is clearly defined over R since Σ grows infinitely in opposite
directions. This function is now strictly increasing on some interval (−∞, a]
and strictly decreasing on some interval [b, ∞), which means that the maximum
value is attained on the compact set [a, b]; which is a global maximum, see Figure
15. This maximum value must be attained at an interior point and Lemma 12
guaranties that Σ has a plane of symmetry parallel to P.

Therefore, for any vertical plane, P, Σ is symmetric respect to some plane
parallel to P. Since the center of mass of any cross section must be contained
in any plane of symmetry, then all vertical planes of symmetry intersect in a
line parallel to ν. Hence, Σ is rotationally symmetric respect to this line.
By Theorem 1 there is a unique rotationally symmetric f -surface Mτ for
each τ > 0. By the uniqueness of the ESWMT-surfaces rotationally symmetric,
Theorem 4, we finally obtain that Σ = Mτ .

Applications of the Jorge-Meeks type formula

In this last section we will apply the results on Section 3 and Section 4 in order to
classify ESWMT-surface of finite total curvature depending on an upper bound
of the total curvature.
Theorem 20. Let Σ ⊂ R3 be a complete ESWMT-surface satisfying (1) of
finite total curvature and embedded outside a compact set. Then,

K dA < 4π, Σ is a plane;

Σ

K dA < 8π, Σ is either a plane or a special catenoid.

Proof. Since there are no compact ESWMT-surfaces, the number of ends must
be greater or equal to one; that is, k ≥ 1. Then, if the total curvature is less
than 4π, by the Jorge-Meeks type formula (34), we have g = 0 and k = 1. Then,
Theorem 9 implies that Σ is a plane. If the total curvature is less than 8π, the
possibilities are g = 1 and k = 1 or g = 0 and k = 2. In the first case, Σ must
be a plane by Theorem 9; in the second case Σ is a special catenoid by Theorem
19.
