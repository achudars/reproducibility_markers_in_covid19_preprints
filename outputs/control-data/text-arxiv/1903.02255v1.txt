Let C ⊆ Fqn be a code, where Fq = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} is the alphabet of q symbols (so q is not
necessarily a power of a prime). For x, y ∈ Fqn , recall that d(x, y) is the number of coordinates
where x and y disagree.
Definition 1.10. The vector B(C) = (B0 , B1 , . . . , Bn ), where
Bi =

1
{(x, y) ∈ C 2 : d(x, y) = i} , i = 0, 1, . . . , n,
|C|

is called the distance distribution of C. Clearly, B0 = 1 and Bi = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , d − 1,
where d is the minimum distance of C.
2

Definition 1.11. The vector B ′ (C) = (B0′ , B1′ , . . . , Bn′ ), where
n

Bi′ =

1 X
(n,q)
Bj Ki
(j), i = 0, 1, . . . , n,
|C|
j=0

is called the dual distance distribution of C or the MacWilliams transform of B(C). Obviously B0′ = 1.
Theorem 1.12 ([36, 37]). The dual distance distribution of C satisfies
Bi′ ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Theorem 1.13 ([60]). If q is a power of a prime and C is a linear code in Fnq , then B ′ (C) is the
distance distribution of the dual code C ⊥ .
Definition 1.14. The smallest positive integer i such that Bi′ 6= 0 is called the dual distance
of C and is denoted by d′ = d′ (C). Denote by s = s(C) (resp., s′ = s′ (C)) the number of nonzero
Bi ’s (resp., Bi′ ’s), i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, i.e.
s = |{i : Bi 6= 0, i > 0}|, s′ = |{i : Bi′ 6= 0, i > 0}|.
The number s′ is called the external distance of C. Define δ = 0 if Bn = 0 and δ = 1 otherwise
(respectively, δ′ = 0 if Bn′ = 0 and δ′ = 1 otherwise).
Definition 1.15. Let C ⊆ Fqn be a code and M be a codeword matrix consisting of all vectors of
C as rows. Then C is called a τ -design if any set of τ -columns of M contains any τ -tuple of Fqτ
the same number of times (namely, λ := |C|/q τ ). The largest positive integer τ such that C is a
τ -design is called the strength of C and is denoted by τ (C). The number λ is called the index
of C.
Remark 1.16. A τ -design in Fqn is also called an orthogonal array of strength τ [37] or a
τ -wise independent set [4] (see also [49]).
Theorem 1.17 ([36, 37]). If C ⊆ Fqn has dual distance d′ = d′ (C), then C is a τ -design, where
τ = d′ − 1.

General linear programming theorems

P
(n,q)
(z), it
dual distance distribution (B0′ , B1′ , . . . , Bn′ ), and any real polynomial f (z) = ni=0 fi Ki

In Definition 1.9.1 in Chapter 1, Aq (n, d) is defined for codes over Fq . We now extend that
definition to codes over Fq as only the alphabet size is important and not its structure.
Definition 2.2. For fixed q, n, and d ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} denote
Aq (n, d) := max{|C| : C ⊆ Fqn , d(C) = d}.
Definition 2.3. For fixed q, n, and τ ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} denote
Bq (n, τ ) := min{|C| : C ⊆ Fqn , τ (C) = τ }.
Theorem 2.4 (Linear Programming Bound for codes [36, 37]). Let the real polynomial f (z) =
Pn
(n,q)
(z) satisfy the conditions
i=0 fi Ki

(A1) f0 > 0, fi ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n;

(A2) f (0) > 0, f (i) ≤ 0 for i = d, d + 1, . . . , n.
Then Aq (n, d) ≤ f (0)/f0 . Equality holds for codes C ⊆ Fqn with d(C) = d, distance distribution (B0 , B1 , . . . , Bn ), dual distance distribution (B0′ , B1′ , . . . , Bn′ ) and polynomials f (z) such that
Bi f (i) = 0 and Bi′ fi = 0 for every i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Remark 2.5. The polynomial f from Theorem 2.4 is implicit in Theorem 1.9.23 a) from Chapter
P
(n,q)
(i) and it is normalized for f0 (or B0 ) to be equal to 1; note
1 as ni=0 Bi Ki
Pnalso the normalization of the Krawtchouk polynomials. Thus the bound f (1)/f0 appears as i=0 Bi in Chapter
1.
Theorem 2.6 (Linear Programming Bound for designs [36, 37]). Let the real polynomial f (z) =
Pn
(n,q)
(z) satisfy the conditions
i=0 fi Ki

(B1) f0 > 0, fi ≤ 0 for i = τ + 1, τ + 2, . . . , n;
(B2) f (0) > 0, f (i) ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Then Bq (n, τ ) ≥ f (0)/f0 . Equality holds for designs C ⊆ Fqn with τ (C) = τ , distance distribution (B0 , B1 , . . . , Bn ), dual distance distribution (B0′ , B1′ , . . . , Bn′ ) and polynomial f (z) such that
Bi f (i) = 0 and Bi′ fi = 0 for every i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Remark 2.7. The Rao Bound in Theorem 3.3 and Levenshtein Bound in 3.10 below are obtained
by suitable polynomials in Theorems 2.4 and 2.6, respectively. Examples of codes attaining these
bounds are listed in Table 1 below.

Theorem 2.8 (Duality, [59]). A real polynomial f (z) satisfies the conditions (A1) and (A2) if
and only if its dual polynomial fb satisfies the conditions (B1) and (B2). Moreover,
f (0) fb(0)
= qn.

Remark 2.9. Rephrased, the duality means that for any polynomial f which is good for linear
programming for codes, its dual is good for linear programming for designs (and conversely).
Thus we obtain, in a sense, bounds for free. In particular, the duality justifies the pairs of bounds
in Theorems 3.1, 3.3 and 3.10 below.
See also [29, 39, 45, 46, 59].
Definition 2.10. For a code C ⊆ Fqn and a function h : {1, 2, . . . , n} → R the potential energy
of C with respect to h is defined to be
Eh (C) :=

X

h(d(x, y)).

x,y∈C,x6=y

Definition 2.11. For fixed q, n, h, and M ∈ {2, 3, . . . , q n } denote
Eh (n, M ; q) := min{Eh (C) : C ⊆ Fqn , |C| = M }.
Theorem 2.12 (Linear Programming Bound for energy of codes [34]). Let n and q be fixed,
h : (0, n] → (0, +∞) be a function, and M ∈ {2, 3, . . . , q n }. Let the real polynomial f (z) =
Pn
(n,q)
(z) satisfy the conditions
i=0 fi Ki

(D1) f0 > 0, fi ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n;

(D2) f (0) > 0, f (i) ≤ h(i) for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Then Eh (n, M ; q) ≥ M (f0 M − f (0)). Equality holds for codes C ⊆ Fqn with distance distribution (B0 , B1 , . . . , Bn ), dual distance distribution (B0′ , B1′ , . . . , Bn′ ) and polynomials f (z), such that
Bi [f (i) − h(i)] = 0 and Bi′ fi = 0 for every i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Remark 2.13. Theorems 2.4, 2.6 and 2.12 can be applied with the usual simplex method for
quite large parameters. For instance, the website [65] (Delsarte, a.k.a. Linear Programming (LP),
upper bounds) offers a tool for computation of bounds via integer LP with Theorem 2.4. Several
websites maintain tables of best known bounds (lower and upper) for codes of relatively small
lengths (see, e.g. [28]).

Universal bounds

The Singleton Bound presented in Theorem 1.9.10 in Chapter 1 is an upper bound on the code
cardinality, given q, n, and d. It is the upper bound in (3) below. Its proof by linear programming
and the duality imply the lower bound in (3).
5

Theorem 3.1 (Singleton Bound [69]). For any code C ⊆ Fqn with minimum distance d and dual
distance d′
′
q d −1 ≤ |C| ≤ q n−d+1 .
(3)
The bounds (3) can be attained only simultaneously and this happens if and only if d + d′ =
n + 2 and all possible distances are realized (so the attaining code is an MDS code).
Definition 3.2. For fixed q, n, and d denote by
Vk (n, q) :=

k  
X
n
i=0

i

(q − 1)i , 0 ≤ k ≤ n,

(volume of a sphere of radius k in Fqn ) and
H n,q (d) = q ε Vk (n − ε, q),
where d = 2k + 1 + ε, ε ∈ {0, 1}.
The Sphere Packing or Hamming Bound presented in Theorem 1.9.6 in Chapter 1 is another
upper bound on the code size, given q, n, and d. Rao gave a lower bound on the code size, given
q, n, and d′ . These bounds are combined in the following theorem, as they are connected by the
duality.
Theorem 3.3 (Rao Bound [64] and Hamming (sphere packing) Bound [48]). For any code C ⊆ Fqn
with minimum distance d and dual distance d′
H n,q (d′ ) ≤ |C| ≤

qn
.
H n,q (d)

(4)

Definition 3.4. Codes attaining the upper bound in (4) are called perfect. Designs attaining
the lower bound in (4) are called tight.
Recall the definitions of s, s′ , δ, and δ′ in Definition 1.14.
Theorem 3.5.

a) A code C ⊆ Fqn (|C| > 1) is a tight design if and only if d′ = 2s − δ + 1.

b) A code C ⊆ Fqn (|C| > 1) is a perfect code if and only if d = 2s′ − δ′ + 1.
See also [12, 42, 59, 64].
Definition 3.6. For fixed n, q, and i denote by ξin,q the smallest root of the Krawtchouk poly(n,q)
nomial Ki
(z). In the case of i = 0 set ξ0n,q = n + 1.
Lemma 3.7 ([57]). The following are valid:
n−2,q
a) For i = 1, 2, . . . , n, ξin−2,q < ξin−1,q < ξi−1
.

b) For z ∈ [1, n], there exists a unique k = k(z) ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and a unique ε = ε(z) ∈ {0, 1}
such that

where k = k(z) and ε = ε(z) ∈ {0, 1} are as in Lemma 3.7b).
Theorem 3.10 (Levenshtein Bound [55, 57, 58]). For any code C ⊆ Fqn with minimum distance
d and dual distance d′
qn
≤ |C| ≤ Ln,q (d).
(5)
Ln,q (d′ )
The lower (upper) bound is attained if and only if d ≥ max{2s′ −δ′ , 2} (respectively, d′ ≥ max{2s−
δ, 2}).
Example 3.11. In the first three relevant intervals, the Levenshtein (upper) Bound is given by
Aq (n, d) ≤

qd
= Ln,q
1 (d)
qd − (q − 1)n

n−1,q
(which is the Plotkin Bound; discussed in Section 1.9.3) if n − n−1

q = ξ1

Aq (n, d) ≤

qd − (q − 1)(n − 1)

if ξ1n−2,q + 1 ≤ d ≤ ξ1n−1,q + 1, and
Aq (n, d) ≤

qd(n(q − 1) + 1)(n(q − 1) − qd + 2 − q)
= Ln,q
3 (d)
qd(2n(q − 1) − q + 2 − qd) − (n − 1)(q − 1)2

if ξ2n−1,q + 1 ≤ d ≤ ξ1n−2,q + 1.
Remark 3.12. It is also worth noting two important values of the Levenshtein Bound:
n−2+ε,q
Ln,q (ξk−1+ε
+ 1) = H n,q (2k − 1 + ε), ε ∈ {0, 1},

h
i
n−1,q
i.e. the Levenshtein Bound at the ends of the intervals ξkn−1−ε,q + 1, ξk−1+ε
+ 1 coincides with
corresponding Rao Bound.
Recall the kernels Tin,q from Definition 1.8 and the parameters k = k(d) and ε = ε(d) from
Lemma 3.7 b). The next theorem gives a Gauss-Jacobi quadrature formula (6), introduced by
Levenshtein in [56, 57], which is instrumental in proofs of Theorem 3.16 and Theorem 3.21 a).
Theorem 3.13 also introduces parameters needed for the universal bound (8) below.
7

Theorem 3.13 ([57]). For any d ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} the polynomial
n−1−ε,q
gd (z) = z(d − z)(n − z)Tk−1
(z − 1, d − 1),

where k = k(d) and ε = ε(d) ∈ {0, 1}, has k + 1 + ε simple zeros
α0 = 0 < α1 = d < · · · < αk+ε ≤ n
n−2,r
with αk+ε = n if and only if ε = 1 or ε = 0 and d = ξk−1

Moreover, for any real polynomial f (z) of degree at most 2k − 1 + ε the following equality
holds:

to obtain the bounds (5). It was shown in [25] that its zeros α1 , . . . , αk+ε strongly suggest the
optimal choice of nodes for the simplex method of Theorem 2.4 (equivalently, Theorem 1.9.23 a)
from Chapter 1). Computational experiments show that simple replacement of any double zero
αi ∈ (j, j + 1) of Levenshtein’s polynomial (7) by two simple zeros j and j + 1 gives in most cases
(conjecture: for every sufficiently large rate d/n) the best result that can ever be obtained from
Theorem 2.4.
Remark 3.15. The assertions of Theorem 3.13 remain true when d ∈ [1, n] is a continuous
variable. In particular, the quadrature formula (6) holds true for any real polynomial f (z)
(d)
of degree at most 2k − 1 + ε with well defined roots of gd (z) and corresponding positive ρi ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , k + 1.
Theorem 3.16 ([68, 56]). The upper bound in (5) cannot be improved by a real polynomial f of
degree at most 2k − 1 + ε satisfying (A1) and the condition f (z) ≤ 0 for z ∈ [d, n].

Theorem 3.18 ([23, 58]). The upper bound in (5) can be improved by a real polynomial f of
degree at least 2k + ε satisfying (A1) and the condition f (z) ≤ 0 for z ∈ [d, n] if and only if
Pjn,q (d) < 0 for some j ≥ 2k + ε.
Definition 3.19. A function h : (0, n] → (0, +∞) is called (strictly) completely monotone
if (−1)i h(i) (z) ≥ 0 (> 0) for every nonnegative integer i and every z ∈ (0, n]. The derivatives
h(i) (z) can be discrete (then z ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}) or continuous.

Theorem 3.20 (Universal lower bound on energy [27]). Let n, q and M ∈ {2, 3, . . . , q n } be fixed
and h : (0, n] → (0, +∞) be a completely monotone function. If M ∈ (H n,q (2k − 1 + ε), H n,q (2k + ε)]
and d = d(M ) ∈ [1, n] is the smallest real root of the equation M = Ln,q

where the parameters αi and ρi are determined as in Theorem 3.13. Equality is attained if and
only if there exists a code with M codewords which attains the upper bound in (5).
Theorem 3.21 ([27]). Let h be a strictly absolutely monotone function. The bound (8):
a) cannot be improved by a real polynomial f of degree at most 2k − 1 + ε satisfying (A1) and
f (z) ≤ h(z) for z ∈ [d, n];
b) can be improved by a real polynomial f of degree at least 2k + ε satisfying (A1) and the
condition f (z) ≤ h(z) for z ∈ [d, n] if and only if Pjn,r (d) < 0 for some j ≥ 2k + ε.

Definition 3.22. A code C ⊆ Fqn is called universally optimal if it (weakly) minimizes potential
energy among all configurations of |C| codewords in Fqn for each completely monotone function
h.
The conditions for attaining the bounds (5) and (8) coincide. Thus, any code which attains
the upper bound in (5) for its cardinality (and therefore the lower bound for (8) for its energy)
is universally optimal. We summarize this in the next theorem.
Theorem 3.23 ([34, 27]). All codes which attain the upper bound in (5) are universally optimal.
Theorem 3.24 ([34]). Let C ⊆ Fqn be a code and h : (0, 1, . . . , n] → R be any function such that
the bound in Theorem 2.12 is attained. Let c ∈ C. Then
Eh (C \ {c}) = Eh (n, |C| − 1; q).
In particular, if C is proved to be universally optimal by Theorem 2.12, then C \ {c} is universally
optimal for all c ∈ C as well.

Example 3.25. The Kerdock codes Kℓ ⊂ F22 [52] are nonlinear codes existing for lengths
n = 22ℓ . Their cardinality is |Kℓ | = n2 = 24ℓ and their distance (weight) distribution is as follows:
B22ℓ−1 −2ℓ−1 = 22ℓ (22ℓ−1 − 1), B22ℓ−1 = 22ℓ+1 − 2, B22ℓ−1 +2ℓ−1 = 22ℓ (22ℓ−1 − 1),
B0 = Bn = 1, Bi = 0 for i 6= 0, 22ℓ−1 − 2ℓ−1 , 22ℓ−1 , 22ℓ−1 + 2ℓ−1 .
It is easy to check that the Kerdock codes are asymptotically optimal with respect to the upper
bound in (5) and the bound (8) as they are very close to the bounds already for small ℓ.
Definition 3.26. For any code C ⊆ Fqn , ρ(C) := max{d(x, C) : x ∈ Fqn } is called the covering
radius of C. Here d(x, C) := min{d(x, c) : c ∈ C}.
Theorem 3.27 ([37], Delsarte Bound). For any code C ⊆ Fqn with external distance s′
ρ(C) ≤ s′ .
Theorem 3.28 ([73, 74], Tietäväinen Bound). For any code C ⊆ Fqn with dual distance d′ =
2k − 1 + ε, where k is positive integer and ε ∈ {0, 1},
ρ(C) ≤ ξkn−1+ε,q .
See also [44, 70].
Asymptotic versions of some of the bounds in this section can be found in Section 1.9.8 of Chapter

Linear programming on Sn−1

Definition 4.1. Let Sn−1 = {x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) : x21 + x22 + · · · + x2n = 1} be the unit sphere in
Rn . The Euclidean distance between x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) and y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) is
p
d(x, y) := (x1 − y1 )2 + (x2 − y2 )2 + · · · + (xn − yn )2 .
The inner product is defined as

(x, y) := x1 y1 + x2 y2 + · · · + xn yn .
Note that on Sn−1 the distance and the inner product are connected by
(x, y) = 1 −

d2 (x, y)
.

Definition 4.2. An (n, M, s)-spherical code is a non-empty finite set C ⊂ Sn−1 with cardinality
|C| = M and maximal inner product
s = max{(x, y) : x, y ∈ C, x 6= y}.

The minimum distance d = d(C) := min{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ C, x 6= y} and the maximal inner
product are connected by

Definition 4.13. A spherical τ -design on Sn−1 is called tight if it attains the bound (10).
Theorem 4.14 ([9, 10]). Let n ≥ 3. Tight spherical τ -designs on Sn−1 exist for τ = 1, 2 and 3
for every n ≥ 2, and possibly for τ = 4, 5, 7, and 11. Tight spherical 4-designs on Sn−1 exist for
n = 6, 22, and possibly for m2 − 3, where m ≥ 7 is an odd integer. Tight spherical 5-designs on
Sn−1 exist for n = 3, 7, 23, and possibly for n = m2 − 2, where m ≥ 7 is an odd integer. Tight
spherical 7-designs on Sn−1 exist for n = 8, 23, and possibly for n = 3m2 − 4, where m ≥ 4 is an
integer. Tight spherical 11-designs on Sn−1 exist only for n = 24.
Remark 4.15 ([38]). Tight spherical 4- and 5-designs coexist and are known for m = 3 and 5
only. Tight spherical 7-designs are known for m = 2 and 3 only.

See also [11, 12, 18] for general theory and [21, 44, 71] for other bounds for designs.

at the ends of the intervals Iτ (τ = 2k − 1 + ε, ε ∈ {0, 1}). In particular, if C ⊆ Sn−1 is a tight
spherical τ -design, then it attains (9) in the left end of the interval Iτ .
Definition 4.17. Given an (extended real-valued) function h(t) : [−1, 1] → [0, +∞], the henergy (or potential energy) of C is given by

x,y∈C,x6=y

Definition 4.18. For fixed n, h, and M ≥ 2 denote by
Eh (n, M ) := inf{Eh (C) : C ⊂ Sn−1 , |C| = M }.
Theorem 4.19 (Linear Programming Bound for energy [75]). Let n ≥ 2, M ≥ 2, h : [−1, 1] →
[0, +∞], and f (t) be a real polynomial such that
(C1) f (t) ≤ h(t) for t ∈ [−1, 1], and

Definition 4.20. A real valued extended function h(t) : [−1, 1] → (0, +∞] is called absolutely
monotone if h(k) (t) ≥ 0, for every t ∈ [−1, 1) and every integer k ≥ 0, and h(1) = limt→1− h(t).
The following absolutely monotone potential functions are commonly used: Newton potential
h(t) = (2 − 2t)−(n−2)/2 = d(x, y)−(n−2) ,
Riesz s-potential
h(t) = (2 − 2t)−s/2 = d(x, y)−s ,

h(t) = exp(2t − 2) = exp(−d(x, y)2 ).

Let α1 < α2 < · · · < αk+ε be the roots of the polynomial used for obtaining the Levenshtein

Theorem 4.22 ([26]). Let n ≥ 2, τ = 2k − 1 + ε ≥ 1, ε ∈ {0, 1}, and h be absolutely monotone
in [−1, 1]. For M ∈ (D(n, τ ), D(n, τ + 1)] let s be the largest root of the equation M = Lτ (n, s)
and α1 < α2 < · · · < αk+ε = s, ρ1 , ρ2 , . . . , ρk+ε be as in Definition 4.21. Then

If an (n, M, s) code attains (12), then it is a spherical τ -design and its inner products form the
set {α1 , α2 , . . . , αk+ε }.
See also [19, Chapter 5]. Note that α1 , α2 , · · · , αk+ε = s are in fact the roots of the equation
M = Lτ (n, s).
Remark 4.23. The conditions for attaining the bounds (9) and (12) coincide. Thus a spherical
(n, M, s) code attains (9) if and only it attains (12). In particular, every tight spherical design
attains (12).
Theorem 4.24 ([68] for (9), [26] for (12)). The bounds (9) and (12) cannot be improved by using
in Theorem 4.7 and 4.19, respectively, polynomials of the same or lower degree.

The bounds (9) and (12) (where M = Lτ (n, αk+ε ) for (12)) can be (simultaneously) improved if
(n)
and only if Qj < 0 for some j > τ .
Definition 4.26. A spherical code C ⊂ Sn−1 is universally optimal if it (weakly) minimizes
h-energy among all configurations of |C| points on S n−1 for each absolutely monotone function h.
Theorem 4.27 ([32]). Every spherical code which is a spherical (2k −1)-design and which admits
exactly k inner
√ products between distinct points is universally optimal. The 600-cell (the unique
(4, 120, (1 + 5)/4)-spherical code) is universally optimal.
15

See also [8, 19, 33].
Remark 4.28. Any code which attains (9) (and (12)) is universally optimal. Is it unknown if
there exists a spherical code, apart from the 600-cell, which is universally optimal but does not
attain (9) (and (12)). Tables with all known codes which attain (9) (and (12)) can be found in
[56, 58, 32].
Example 4.29. Consider the case (n, M ) = (4, 24). The well known code D4 (D4 root system;
equivalently, the set of vertices of the regular 24-cell) is optimal in the sense that it realizes the
fourth kissing number [62]. However, this code is not universally optimal [30], despite having
1
it
energy which is very close to the bound (12). For example, with the Newtonian h(t) = 2(1−t)
has energy 334, while (12) gives 333 (which can be improved to ≈ 333.157).
Conjecture 4.30. Every universally optimal spherical code attains the Linear Programming
Bound of Theorem 4.19.
Example 4.31. (Example 3.25 continued.) A standard construction (see [35, Chapter 5]) maps
√
binary codes from Fn2 to the sphere Sn−1 – the coordinates 0 and 1 are replaced by ±1/ n,
respectively. Denote this map by x → x. The inner product (x, y) on Sn−1 and the Hamming
distance dH (x, y) in Fn2 are connected by (x, y) = 1 − 2dHn(x,y) . Thus the weights of the Kerdock
code Kℓ correspond to the inner products 1, √1n , 0, − √1n , −1, respectively.
2ℓ

The image Kℓ ⊂ S2 −1 of Kℓ is asymptotically optimal with respect to both bounds (9) and
(12). For example, it has energy

Linear programming in other coding theory problems

Remark 5.1 (Linear programming in Johnson spaces). All concepts and results from Sections 1-3
hold true for the Johnson spaces with changes corresponding to the role of the Hahn polynomials
instead of the Krawtchouk polynomials. See [36, 39, 56, 58, 59, 61].
