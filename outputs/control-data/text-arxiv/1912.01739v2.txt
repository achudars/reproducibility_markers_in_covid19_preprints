MEASURING URBAN ROAD NETWORK RESILIENCE TO EXTREME EVENTS:
AN APPLICATION FOR URBAN FLOODS

ABSTRACT
Designing and maintaining resilient transportation systems rely on identifying potential vulnerabilities and
inefficiencies before crises occur. However, given the complexity of transportation networks, as well as the
diversity of ways in which systems can fail, the problem of assessing the impacts of exceptional phenomena still
lacks tools and metrics for analysis. Therefore, this paper aims to present a method for assessing the behavior of
road networks during crises in which segments are disabled or unusable for a time. The method proposed was
structured around two metrics calculated from the road network and trip distribution: network continuity and
efficiency of alternative. With these metrics, we assess, as an example, the local and global impacts of various
flooding scenarios in a case study at São Carlos, a medium-sized Brazilian city in the state of São Paulo. Our
findings indicate that pedestrian movements are significantly less impacted than motorized vehicles by floods in
the city, which may be due to the car-oriented nature of the avenues closest to rivers, and the shortest average
length of pedestrian trips. These findings and metrics set a framework for further research involving other cities
and natural phenomena to enrich the understanding of resilience in urban transportation networks.

1. INTRODUCTION
Transportation planning has traditionally considered a static road system where traffic does not
suffer from the influence of external factors such as environmental catastrophes. This alongside
the deterministic conception of nature was associated with the twentieth-century modernist
thinking (Ahern 2011). Recently, however, transportation systems have also been considered
in terms of adverse situations, to plan for more resilient systems in fault situations (Appert and
Chapelon 2007; Chan and Schofer 2016; Martins, Rodrigues da Silva, and Pinto 2019; Westrum
2006).
Resilience is often defined as the capacity of a system to adapt when exposed to adverse
situations, avoiding potential losses (Westrum 2006). However, considering the diversity of
ways in which a transportation system can fail, with some being more frequent than others
depending on the region's demographic and geographical conditions, building a single model
to cover all planning for resilient transportation systems becomes a challenge. Thus, different
ways to target the problem were devised, some measuring the overall capacity of systems to
absorb impacts (Ip and Wang 2011; Leu, Abbass, and Curtis 2010; Morelli and Cunha 2019b)
and others focusing on specific events such as an oil supply crisis (Martins et al. 2019; Newman,
Beatley, and Boyer 2009), hurricanes (Beheshtian et al. 2018; Chan and Schofer 2016; Litman
2005) or floods (Gil and Steinbach 2008; Morelli and Cunha 2019a). However, there is little
consensus between the various types of analysis, making the integration of models a highly
complex process. This reality highlights the need for more comprehensive methods that can be

easily integrated with other established urban planning methods.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Studies in resilience of urban transportation generally assess the ability of the network to absorb
atypical events. More generalist models aim to measure network redundancy, robustness, or
vulnerability, without previously defining the problem to be addressed by the city in a crisis
(Berche et al. 2009; Ip and Wang 2011; Leu et al. 2010; Morelli and Cunha 2019b). Several
works with this general nature use graph theory to understand system fragility, like Appert and
Chapelon (2007) who studied the impact of removing specific edges on Montpellier’s main
road network in France; a similar analysis, conducted by Rodríguez-Núñez and GarcíaPalomares (2014), focused on public transportation infrastructure, removing connections from
the Madrid subway system, keeping track of the routes affected by the action in an attempt to
define the importance order of the systems’ links. Berche et al. (2009) analyzed the effect of
systematic attacks with graph theory parameters to transit networks in 14 cities around the
world, in which the author defines as “attack” the removal of connections in the network. Ganin
et al. (2017) focused on random network degradation, this time measuring the changes in the
total delay in 40 cities in the United States. In Brazil, Morelli and Cunha (2019b) applied
systematic attacks on the networks of the 306 largest Brazilian cities, measuring system
continuity based on the number of routes that remain viable after an attack. Doing this, they
determined the strategy that imposes faster degradation and found that edges with high
betweenness centrality tend to be more vulnerable.
On the other hand, some studies focus on more specific problems, such as oil supply crises
(Leung, Burke, and Cui 2018; Martins et al. 2019; Newman et al. 2009) and natural disasters
(Gil and Steinbach 2008; Litman 2005; Lu, Peng, and Zhang 2014; Morelli and Cunha 2019a).
Martins, Rodrigues da Silva e Pinto (2019) look at changes in travel patterns by analyzing the
ability of users to change from fuel-dependent modes to active ones looking at traveled
distances in the network. Chan and Schofer (2016) analyzed the decay of passenger numbers in
two large urban rail systems during hurricanes. Some studies assess the impact of flooding on
networks (Gil and Steinbach 2008; Morelli and Cunha 2019a) through a geometric standpoint,
not taking into account the travel distribution on the studied regions.
In the cases above, works focusing on travel distribution tend to have little focus on the structure
of the transportation network, while works focusing on connectivity and structure, tend to
relegate travel behavior to the background, making both methods difficult to integrate with an
analysis that can take into account the accumulated effects of both phenomena.
3. PROPOSED METHOD
The strategy proposed to assess the impacts of link deactivation consists of calculating two
different indices: one to measure continuity – a measure of redundancy – and another to measure
the efficiency of alternative paths. The method is summarized in the flowchart in Figure 1.

Only two datasets are needed as input for these steps: a city’s road network and travel
distribution between traffic zones (Origin/Destination or OD matrix), both marked in light grey
in Figure 1. These types of datasets are common in transportation planning practice, facilitating
the incorporation of the method by stakeholders in decision making. The analysis was
conducted through libraries of graph processing and geoanalysis from Python programing
language.
3.1. Network disruption
The disruption of a network occurs for different reasons depending on the impact studied.
However, the effects on network structures can be reduced to a simple phenomenon: an event
acts to limit or prevent movement on a road or a series of them. In this paper we targeted events
that prevent movement along links. Figure 2 shows possible impacts on a route when the event
may:
•
•
•

Not affect the route (Figure 2(a));
Divert a route (Figure 2(b)), increasing its length;
Affect the route and all its alternatives (Figure 2(c)) rendering the route impossible;

In these cases, we assume the user will always follow the shortest path connecting two points.
Therefore, a damaging event on a road network can never decrease route lengths.

Figure 2: Types of impact for a single route.

An urban road system will be denoted as a graph to simulate events where network disruption
occurs. In this mathematical structure, road segments are represented by edges and intersections
are represented by nodes. This representation is commonly referred to as the primal
representation of the road network (Porta, Crucitti, and Latora 2006). In this configuration, a
trip can be generated from any node in the system to any other, traversing the edges of the
graph. Figure 3 shows a fictional urban region represented by a graph and a route within this
network (in red).

Figure 3: Graph of a fictional urban network with a route (red).

The blockage of movement along a road segment can be achieved by removal of the referred
edge from the graph, so the minimum paths generated in the disrupted network ignore the
blocked road. However, it is necessary to differentiate between the impacts for modes that
follow the direction of the road (bicycles, cars, motorcycles, and motor vehicles in general) and
pedestrian movements, which can traverse the network in either direction of the links. Apart
from this, due to municipal restrictions, some roads may also limit or not allow traffic to some
modes of transportation. In this case, the networks defined for the various types of movement
are distinct, requiring a split-mode impact assessment. In this paper we evaluate the impacts on
pedestrians (with an undirected graph) and motorized vehicles (with a directed graph).
The OSMnx library (Boeing, 2017) in Python language was used for extracting graph networks.
This library extract databases directly from the OpenStreetMap platform, which differentiates
walking and driving networks. This distinction is important because both distances traveled,
and accessibility depends on how agents interact with the network. For example, a pedestrian’s

path may be shorter than that of a motorized vehicle, as shown in Figure 4(a), or a path that is
possible for a pedestrian may not be available for a motorized vehicle after the deactivation of
a link, as can be seen in Figure 4(b).

3.2. Impact between traffic zones
The impact of network degradation depends mainly on how travel routes from a OD matrix are
allocated. The average length of trips can sometimes be estimated by the route between
centroids of traffic zones, as in Martins et al. (2019) and represented in Figure 5 (a), but this
approach would lead to poor results when evaluating changes happening in a network structure,
as the metrics become solely dependent on links used for the path between centroids. In this
case, to measure the impact of network degradation it is necessary to consider a more diverse
set of routes (Figure 5 (b)). Thus, to tackle this problem we propose the use of a random sample
of routes that start in zone A and end in zone B to represent the impact on the OD pair A/B.
This sample has to be large enough to capture the properties of the pair, but not too large to
limit the computational load. For the case study in this paper, as we evaluate a mid-sized city,
we decided to consider all possible pairs between zones, but larger urban areas may require
down sampling. The paths were calculated through Dijkstra's algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959) using
the iGraph library (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006).
Thereby, we can obtain the interconnectedness and the average route length between each OD
pair, so we can define two metrics: network continuity and efficiency of alternative, which
are explained in the sections below.

3.4.1. Network continuity
In short, a network has perfect continuity if all nodes can be reached in the graph from any other
node. On the other hand, if an exceptional event, such as a flood, isolates two or more blocks
in a city, preventing traffic between them, the city loses continuity. Hence, continuity between
two traffic zones is proposed to be the ratio of node-to-node paths of the network graph which
remain valid between zones after an impact, so that:

𝐂(𝐀, 𝐁) = ∑ ∑
𝒔∊𝑨 𝒕∊𝑩

Where:

𝑽(𝒔, 𝒕)
𝑵𝑨 ∙ 𝑵𝑩

(1)

𝐴 e 𝐵: Traffic zones in the network;
𝑠: Node belonging to zone A;
𝑡: Node belonging to zone B;
𝑁𝐾 : Number of nodes in zone K;
𝑉(𝑠, 𝑡): Validity function. Assumes 1 if the route from s to t exists and 0 if not.

Equation 3 considers only one type of network, represented by a single graph. However, as
discussed earlier, different modes of transportation have movements of different nature,
requiring different types of graph structures. In this case, continuity can be measured for each
mode of transportation separately.
3.4.2. Efficiency of alternative
Route efficiency can be inferred from the average minimum distances between traffic zones.
When a network element is removed, routes that previously depended on that element must be
diverted, generally increasing the total path length. A network is efficient at absorbing an impact
when it offers similar routes connecting nodes, requiring no large detours and leading the
average increase in distances to be minimal or zero.

The distance between two points can only be measured for valid routes in the system. In this
case, it is usual to consider the proximity between points as a metric, instead of the distance.
The proximity of two points is the inverse of the distance between then, as in:

𝐏(𝐬, 𝐭) =
Where:

𝟏
𝐝(𝐬, 𝐭)

(2)

P(s, t): Proximity between s e t;
d(s, t): Distance between s and t.

Likewise, two points that are not reachable from each other can be defined as having zero
proximity, making it unnecessary to disregard any pair of points in the calculation. Therefore,
route efficiency between two traffic zones A and B can be defined as the average route
proximity like:

𝛈(𝐀, 𝐁) = ∑ ∑
𝒔∊𝑨 𝒕∊𝑩

𝑷(𝒔, 𝒕)
𝑵𝑨 ∙ 𝑵𝑩

(3)

It should be noted that, particularly in motorized vehicle routes, the efficiency from zone A to
zone B is not necessarily equal to the efficiency from B to A and the existence of a route from
nodes s to t does not imply the existence of a route from t to s given the directed nature of the
graph. Thus, both the efficiency and continuity functions are generally non-symmetrical.
3.4.3. Relative impact in traffic zones
To measure relative impact, we weighed the total number of trips taking place between traffic
zones on the continuity and efficiency metrics. This assumption captures the fact that impacts
on movements between low demand OD pairs are less important than impacts on movements
of high demand OD pairs. Besides, we consider the effects of impacts on different modes of
transportation as a proportion of trips dependent on each mode. Therefore, the impact of a
phenomenon in a traffic zone is given by the weighted average of the impacts generated in trips
with origin or destination in the traffic zone, thus:

𝑪(𝐀) = ∑
𝑲∊𝑮

𝜼(𝐀) = ∑
𝑲∊𝑮

Where:

[𝑪(𝑨, 𝑲) ∙ 𝑻(𝑨, 𝑲) + 𝑪(𝑲, 𝑨) ∙ 𝑻(𝑲, 𝑨)]
𝑻(𝑨, 𝑲) + 𝑻(𝑲, 𝑨)

(4)

[𝜼(𝑨, 𝑲) ∙ 𝑻(𝑨, 𝑲) + 𝜼(𝑲, 𝑨) ∙ 𝑻(𝑲, 𝑨)]
𝑻(𝑨, 𝑲) + 𝑻(𝑲, 𝑨)

(5)

𝑮: Network graph;
𝑲: Traffic zone from graph G;
𝑨: Reference traffic zone;
𝑻(𝒁𝟏, 𝒁𝟐): Total trips between zones 𝒁𝟏 e 𝒁𝟐 using the mode 𝒎;

𝑪𝒎 (𝒁𝟏, 𝒁𝟐): Continuity between zones 𝒁𝟏 and 𝒁𝟐 for mode 𝒎;
𝜼𝒎 (𝒁𝟏, 𝒁𝟐): Efficiency between zones 𝒁𝟏 and 𝒁𝟐 for mode 𝒎.
And finally, when assessing resilience generally there is no intention to evaluate the continuity
or efficiency of a network in absolute terms during an exceptional event, but rather the relative
reduction in these parameters during the event. To measure this, efficiency and continuity are
defined for an unchanged state (𝜼𝟎 and 𝑪𝟎 ) and for the post-event scenario in a disturbed state
(𝜼𝒇 and 𝑪𝒇 ), with the relative index for an event being calculated as a proportion. Thus, the
continuity and efficiency indices may be defined, respectively, as:

Where:

𝑰𝑪 (𝐀) =

𝑪𝒇 (𝑨)
𝑪𝟎 (𝑨)

4. APPLICATION AND DISCUSSION
To test the method effectiveness, the impacts of flooding scenarios in São Carlos, São Paulo,
Brazil, as defined by Morelli and Cunha (2019a), are evaluated in this session. The distribution
of trips in the city is given by the OD survey conducted in 2007/2008 for the municipality, with
the division of the territory into 41 traffic zones. In the universe of interviewees, an average of
just over 6,000 trips per day were recorded, distributed among walking, cycling, individual
motorized, bus, and other modes. For this paper, only walking, cycling, and individual
motorized trips are considered. Also, we consider only the most important trips, disregarding
those with leisure motives. As for the road network, the topological data was obtained from the
open-access collaborative mapping platform OpenStreetMap while the topographical data of
the nodes – for the flooding scenarios – was obtained from the Google Maps API (Google Maps
API, 2019).
4.1. Flood scenarios
The Master Plan of the city, created in 2005 and still in effect, delineates the areas at greater
risk of flooding at the time. Since then and going forward, the effects of climate change,
urbanization, and poor drainage may cause the expansion of flood risk areas. In this case study,
we aim to simulate an increase in flooding intensity by gradually expanding the risk zones
through fixed rises in water level. We define the baseline scenario as a flood affecting the risk
areas defined in the Master Plan. As the intensity increases and the water level (Δy) go up, areas
at higher elevation begin to flood as well, expanding blockages created by floods. The blockage
of traffic by flooding was simulated with the removal of all edges in the graph that was
connected to at least one flooded node. We raised the water level in steps of 10 cm from the
baseline up until 1.5 m. Some of these flooding scenarios can be seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Flooding scenarios in the city of São Carlos, São Paulo State, Brazil.

In each scenario, the flooded edges are removed from the graph, and the impact of the flooding
events in continuity and efficiency is measured using Equations 6 and 7, considering the
unaltered graph as the initial state and the flooded graph as the final. These metrics were applied
to two types of graph. The first – directed – is relative to motorized vehicles and bikes; and the
second – undirected – is relative to pedestrians. The relative results for bicycles and motorized
vehicle flows are represented in Figure 7, while Figure 8 shows the results for pedestrians. We
observed that, in general, the southern regions of the city are more impacted than the northern
regions, rendering the population in these areas more vulnerable to extreme flood events. This
occurs in both motorized and pedestrian movements similarly, as there are no expressive
differences between the distribution on pedestrian and motorized impacts. On the other hand,
the overall impact on the system tends to show a large difference between modes, as depicted
in Figure 9, which contains the curve for motorized vehicles and bicycles (Figure 9 (a)),
pedestrians (Figure 9 (b)) and the whole system (Figure 9 (c)). Pedestrian movements suffer
lower impacts on average if compared to motorized vehicles and bicycles. We hypothesize that
this is due to the nature of the movements in question, as the marginal avenues of the city –
which are more prone to floods – are largely car-oriented and very important to the city road
network for relatively long-distance trips, as it connects the residential suburbs to the
commercial center. On the contrary, pedestrians tend to focus their movements on the more
densely populated core of the city and to make relatively short trips. This way, although the
network is impacted almost the same way for pedestrians and motorized vehicles, the nature of
the trips is responsible for the largest difference in the resilience of the trip.

Moreover, floods that exceed 1.0 m from the baseline impose major decreases in the metrics
for the network, with 55% of car routes being blocked and the efficiency of paths falling to
50%, which means the routes during the events are twice as long on average. For pedestrians,
on the other hand, there are no large dips in the curves. This is another evidence that motorized
vehicles are more vulnerable to blockages, particularly in arterial roads, which tend to create
bottlenecks in the system.
5. CONCLUSION
We proposed a novel method for measuring the resilience of transportation to extreme events
in urban road networks based on travel distribution. The databases required for the analysis are
the road network and the OD matrix, both already common in the practice of urban planning,
which facilitates the integration of this method in decision-making processes and favors the
creation of a consensus on the techniques used for planning resilience in transportation
networks.
Two metrics are proposed: network continuity and efficiency of alternative. Continuity
measures the proportion of routes blocked by a network disruption event. This metric can
indicate how parts of a city may become isolated during an exceptional event, making these
regions inaccessible to users, residents, and emergency vehicles. The efficiency of alternative
is indicative of the average increase in route lengths, which impact on fuel consumption and
time loss on motorized vehicles’ trips. However, they impact more directly active modes of
transportation, like bicycles and pedestrians, which are forced to traverse larger distances to get
to their destinations and possibly render the trip impossible if the maximum walking or cycling
distance for the user is exceeded.
As a case study, these metrics were applied to measure the impact of flooding in the city of São
Carlos, a mid-sized city in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It was observed that extreme flooding
events add significant stress to the network, with the southern regions of the city accounting for
most of the impact. The overall impact for pedestrians is significantly smaller than that of
motorized vehicles, probably due to the average length of the trips being larger for vehicles,
and to the car-oriented nature of the avenues closest to rivers in this city, as happens in many

other cities in the world. This is an indicator that more densely packed cities, with shortest trips
overall, tend to be more resilient to these extreme events, since longer paths have a higher
probability of depending on a street segment affected by the flood, which is to be tested in
further research.
The case study is an example of the applicability of these metrics in other research to evaluate
in a relatively simple way the impacts of extreme events of various natures in different cities,
setting a framework for further research on transport network’s resilience. Also, as the data
needed for this analysis are relatively common in mid- to large-sized cities, these metrics may
prove to be good guides to decision-makers and city planners to create policy on transportation
systems.
