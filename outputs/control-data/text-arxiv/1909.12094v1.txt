Abstract
We consider the problem of when one quandle homomorphism will factor through
another, restricting our attention to the case where all quandles involved are connected.
We provide a complete solution to the problem for surjective quandle homomorphisms
using the structure theorem for connected quandles of Ehrman et al. [2] and the
factorization system for surjective quandle homomorphsims of Bunch et al. [1] as our
primary tools. The paper contains the substantive results obtained by an REU research
group consisting of the first four authors under the mentorship of the fifth, and was
supported by National Science Foundation, grant DMS-1659123.

Motivation

Quandles were originally defined by Joyce [3] for the purpose of studying classical knots.
However, as was shown by Yetter [5], they are closely bound up with monodromy phenomena.
They allow a purely algebraic description of monodromy as a homomorphism of quandles,
or of augmented quandles, from the knot quandle of the singular set in the base (possibly
equipped with its canonical augmentation in the fundamental group of the complement of the
singular set) to a quandle (or augmented quandle) associated with the generic fiber. Thus
the study of homomorphisms of quandles has the potential for application in a variety of

1

geometric settings in which monodromy naturally arises (as for example, branched coverings
and Lefschetz fibrations).
The study of the structure of quandle homormorphisms is intrinsically difficult; for in
our present understanding, there is very little control over how subquandles sit inside larger
ambient quandles (cf. Ehrman, et al. [2] and Nelson and Wong [4] which give decomposition
theorems and corresponding constructions of larger quandles from subquandles which are
orbits under the inner automorphism group).
The present work is a contribution to the difficult problem of determining conditions
under which one quandle homomorphism will factor through another: a problem, the solution
to which would allow the construction of invariants of branched covers of 3-manifolds from
quandle colorings of the link which is the branch set of the cover.
Here, we consider only those homomorphisms with a(n algebraically) connected source:
these would describe monodromy in which the singular set in the base is topologically connected (as in the case of a branched covering with a knot as the branch set). We, however,
do not address the full problem, restricting our attention to a setting in which both the
quandles and the homomorphisms involved are well understood: surjective homomorphisms
between connected quandles. This restriction is less onerous than it might seem, as the image of any quandle homomorphism with connected source is always a connected subquandle
of the target quandle.

Background

We recall from Joyce [3]
Definition 2.1. A quandle is a set Q with two binary operations, ⊲ and ⊲−1 such that
i) ∀x ∈ Q, x ⊲ x = x
ii) ⊲ is right-invertible, i.e. ∀x, y ∈ Q, (x ⊲ y) ⊲−1 y = x = (x ⊲−1 y) ⊲ y
iii) ⊲ is right-distributive, i.e. ∀x, y, z ∈ Q, (x ⊲ y) ⊲ z = (x ⊲ z) ⊲ (y ⊲ z)
A quandle homomorphism is a mapping Φ between (Q, ⊲) and (Q′ , ⊲′ ) such that ∀x, y ∈
Q, Φ(x ⊲ y) = Φ(x) ⊲′ Φ(y). Preservation of ⊲ implies preservation of ⊲−1 .
2

Much of the complication in quandle theory comes from the lack of constants in the
theory, resulting in there being no analogues of the kernels found in group and ring theory.
Fortunately, quandle theory is initimately related to the more familiar theory of groups in a
number of ways. The first was observed by Joyce [3]: by defining x ⊲ y as xyx−1 and x ⊲−1 y
as x−1 yx, any union of conjugacy classes in a group G forms a quandle. It is a theorem of
Joyce [3] that free quandles admit such a representation (as a union of conjugacy classes in
a free group). When the entire group G is made into a quandle in this way, it is denoted
Conj(G), and group homomorphisms induce quandle homomorphisms, so that Conj is a
functor from the category of groups, Grps, to the category of quandles, Quand.
There are also three groups canonically associated to any quandle.
First, like any mathematical object, quandles admit an automorphism group: Aut(Q)
being the group of invertible quandle homomorphisms from Q to itself.
Second, the inner automorphism group of a quandle, denoted Inn(Q), is the subgroup
of Aut(Q) generated by the symmetries Sx of Q: that is, the maps given by
Sx (y) := y ⊲ x.
It is an easy exercise to show that Inn(Q) is abelian if and only if it is trivial.
Finally, there is a group AdConj(Q) with presentation
h q ∈ Q | (q ⊲ r)rq −1r −1 , (q ⊲−1 r)r −1q −1 r for all q, r ∈ Qi
The notation derives from the theorem of Joyce that AdConj is the left adjoint to the functor
from Conj : Grps → Quand.
A connected quandle is a quandle Q that contains only one orbit under the action of
Inn(Q).
As our primary object of study will be surjective quandle homomorphisms, we should
recall several results and definitions from Bunch et al. [1].
First
Theorem 2.2. [1] The assignment of inner automorphism groups to quandles is a functor
from Quandepi the category with quandles as objects and surjective quandle homomorphisms
as arrows to Grps the category of groups, and
3

Q 7→ (Q, Inn(Q), q 7→ − ⊲ q)
is a functor from Quandepi to AugQuand, the category of augmented quandles.
Definition 2.3. [1] A rigid quotient is a surjective quandle homomorphism h : Q ։ R such
that the induced group homomorphism f : Inn(Q) → Inn(R) is an isomorphism.
Definition 2.4. [1] A realizable kernel is a subgroup H ⊂ Inn(Q) where h is a surjective
quandle homomorphism h : Q ։ R and H = ker(Inn(h)).
It should be observed first that this definition is a property of normal subgroups of
an inner automorphism group Inn(Q) of a specified quandle Q, not of an abstract group
isomorphic to Inn(Q). And second that it is non-vacuous: unless the commutator subgroup
is the entire group, it is never a realizable kernel.
Curiously, the orbits under any normal subgroup of Inn(Q) acting on Q admit a quandle
structure induced by that on Q, indeed Bunch et al. [1] showed that the orbits under
a subgroup of Inn(Q) have an induced quandle structure if and only if the subgroup is
normal. But if N is not a realizable kernel, then there will be a larger subgroup which is a
realizable kernel, and which has the same orbits as N:
Bunch et al. [1] also showed that the intersection of an arbitrary family of realizable
kernels in Inn(Q) is a realizable kernel, and thus (noting that the whole group is a realizable
kernel), there is a closure operation on the normal subgroups of Inn(Q), giving the smallest
realizable kernel containing N. We denote the closure of N under this operation by N Q , as
we will have cause to consider the closure operation with respect to different quandles with
the same inner automorphism group simultaneously.
Bunch et al. [1] also provided a constructive description of this closure operation:
Theorem 2.5. [1] Let N be a normal subgroup of G = Inn(Q), and let [q] denote the orbit
of q under the restriction of the action of G to N, and cN : Q → Q/N the quotient quandle
homomorphism, then
N Q = ker(Inn(cN )) =

\
X∈Q

.

G[x]

Theorem 2.6. [1] For any surjective quandle homomorphism h : Q ։ R, if N = ker(Inn(h))
and gN is the canonical homomorphism from Q to Q/N then h can be factored as f (gN ),
where f : G/N ։ R is a rigid quotient.
Here Q/N is the set of orbits of Q under the restriction of the action of Inn(Q) on Q to
N with the quandle structure [q] ⊲ [r] = [q ⊲ r] with [x] denoting the orbit of x ∈ Q. We
refer to such a quotient as an orbit quotient.
We also observe that the proof of several results on connected quandles given by Ehrman
et al. [2] will carry a similar result without restricting the cardinality of the quandle in
question to be finite:
In what follows, let Q be a connected quandle and let G = Inn(Q).
We then have, by a well-know elementary result on group actions
Proposition 2.7. There is an equivariant bijection between Q and H\G, the set of right
cosets of H.
Theorem 2.8. Fix an element q ∈ Q, let H < G be its stabilizer, and identify Q with the set
of right H cosets, H\Q by the equivariant map of Proposition 2.7. Let |·| be the augmentation
map | · | : H\G → G that is the map which assigns to Hg the map (− ⊲ Hg) ∈ G. Then
letting η = |H| we have η ∈ Z(H) where Z(H) is the center of H. Further, G is generated
by {g −1ηg | g ∈ G} and the action of G on H\G is faithful. Moreover, the quandle operation
is given in terms of stabilizer cosets by Hg ⊲ Hγ = Hgγ −1ηγ.
Proof. The proof is essentially identical to the proof of Ehrman et al. [2] Theorem 4.3. The
faithfulness of the action is immediate from the fact the G is a subgroup of Aut(Q).
Similary omitting cardinality restrictions, the proof of Ehrman et al. [2] Theorem 4.5
gives
Theorem 2.9. Let H < G be a group with specified subgroup H, and η ∈ Z(H) and element
of the center of the subgroup such that {g −1ηg | g ∈ G} generates G. Then H\G is a
connected quandle under the operation Hg ⊲ Hγ := Hgγ −1ηγ. If, moreover, the action of G
on H\G is faithful, then Inn(H\G) = G, otherwise Inn(H\G) ∼
= G/NH\G where
NH\G := {g ∈ G | ∀γ ∈ GHγ = Hγg }

Results

Using the definitions and results of the preceding section as our primary tools, we now
consider the question of when one surjective quandle homomorphism between connected
quandles, g : Q → R2 , factors through another h : Q → R1 in the sense that there is a
quandle homomorphism φ : R1 → R2 such that g = φ(h).
In view of Theorem 2.6 the quandle homomorphisms g and h factor as shown by the solid
arrows of the diagram below
R1
Q/N1
Q

Q/N2

R2

We give conditions for the existence of a homomorphism between Q/N1 and Q/N2 , as
shown in the diagram, then extend the problem to rigid quotients, providing conditions for
a homomorphism from R1 to R2 .
Our first result does not require connectedness as a hypothesis. Its proof turns largely
on the following elementary observation about group actions, wherein the orbit of xi under
the action of G is denoted xi G.
Lemma 3.1. Suppose the group G acts on the set X. Let x1 , x2 ∈ X. Then x1 G = x2 G iff
x1 = x2 · g for some g ∈ G.
Consider the following:
Theorem 3.2. Let gN1 : Q → Q/N1 and gN2 : Q → Q/N2 be two orbit quotients of Q by
realizable kernels Ni (i = 1, 2). Denoting the orbit of q ∈ Q under the action of Ni by q · Ni ,
these are given by gNi (q) = q ·Ni . Then there is a quandle homomorphism Ω : Q/N1 → Q/N2

6

such that the diagram
Q/N1
Ω

g N1
Q

g N2

Q/N2

commutes if and only if N1 ⊆ N2 .
Proof. Plainly for the diagram to commute, Ω : Q/N1 → Q/N2 must be given by Ω(q · N1 ) =
q ·N2 . The proof of the theorem thus consists in showing that this formula give a well-defined
quandle homomorphism whenever N1 ⊆ N2 , and conversely.
First, we will prove that Ω is well-defined. Let a·N1 , b·N1 ∈ Q/N1 . Then Ω(a·N1 ) = a·N2
and Ω(b · N1 ) = b · N2 . Suppose a · N1 = b · N1 . Then by Lemma 3.1 we have a = b · n for
some n ∈ N1 . Since N1 ⊂ N2 , we have n ∈ N2 so a = b · n for some n ∈ N2 . By Lemma 3.1
we then have a · N2 = b · N2 . Since Ω(a · N1 ) = a · N2 and Ω(b · N1 ) = b · N2 . Thus, we have
Ω(a · N1 ) = Ω(b · N1 ).
Let the orbit q · N1 , q ′ · N1 ∈ Q/N1 . Then Ω(q · N1 ) = q · N2 and Ω(q ′ · N1 ) = q ′ · N2 .
Since gN2 is a quandle homomorphism, q · N2 ⊲ q ′ · N2 = (q ⊲ q ′ ) · N2 , Therefore,
Ω(q · N1 ) ⊲ Ω(q ′ · N1 ) = q · N2 ⊲ q ′ · N2 = (q ⊲ q ′ ) · N2 = Ω((q ⊲ q ′ ) · N1 ).
Hence, Ω is a homomorphism.
Suppose Ω is a well-defined homomorphism. Assume, for the purpose of contradiction,
that N1 * N2 . Let x · N1 ∈ Q/N1 where x ∈ N1 but x ∈
/ N2 . Then Ω(xN1 ) = xN2 . But
Ω(x · N1 ) = Ω(N1 ) = N2 , which implies x · N2 = N2 and x ∈ N2 . Thus, by contradiction,
N1 ⊆ N2 .
The previous result did not depend on the quandles involve being connected. We now
turn to results in which connectededness is important, beginning with characterizing orbit
quotients of connected quandles in terms of the presentation as right cosets of a stablilizer
subgroup given in Theorem 2.8. Again, our result requires a lemma from the theory of group
actions:

7

Lemma 3.3. Let S be a set equipped with a right action of a group Γ, f : S × Γ → S and
N a normal subgroup of a group Γ. Then the map fN : S/N × Γ/N → S/N defined by
fN (s · N, gN) = (s · g) · N is a well-defined group action. And, moreover, when this action
is lifted to an action of Γ along the quotient map c : Γ → Γ/N, the map S → S/N carrying
each element to its orbit under the restriction of the action to N is Γ-equivariant, that is,
the diagram
f

S×Γ

S/N × Γ

Id × c

S/N × Γ/N

S

fN

S/N

commutes.
Proof. We denote the original group action f by the infix ·.
Well-definition: Suppose for some σ, δ ∈ S and g, h ∈ Γ, (σ · N, gN) = (δ · N, hN),
which implies σ·N = δ·N and gN = hN. Hence, by Lemma 3.1, σ = δ·n and g = h·n′ where
n, n′ ∈ N. Therefore, fN (σ · N, gN) = (σ · g) · N = (δ · n · h · n′ ) · N = fN ((δ · n) · N, (hn′ )N) =
fN (δ · N, hN). Thus fN (σ · N, gN) = fN (δ · N, hN).
Identity Property: Let e be the identity element of Γ. Then fN (σ · N, eN) =
(σ · e) · N = σ · (eN) = σ · N.
Associativity: We have f (f (σ · N, gN), hN) = f ((σ · g) · N, hN) = ((σ · g) · h) · N =
(σ · (gh)) · N = f (σ · N, ghN).
Equivariance: Having shown that fN is well-defined, this is immediate by construction.
Now, let Q be a connected quandle, G = Inn(Q), q ∈ Q and H = Gq the stabilizer
subgroup. As in Theorem 2.8, we can identify Q with H\G and give the quandle operation
in terms of the augmentation value η ∈ Z(H) of the trivial coset H.
Theorem 3.4. For Q, G, q, H and η as above, let N be a realizable kernel, then the orbit
quotient quandle Q/N whose elements are the orbits of Q under the restriction of the action
of G to N is connected with Inn(Q/N) ∼
= G/N. Let H1 := (G/N)qN = {hN | qN ·hN = qN}
8

be the stabilizer of the image of q in Q/N. Denoting the augmentation for either quandle by
| − |, we then have
• H1 = HN/N,
• |H1 | = ηN,
• |H1 | = ηN ∈ Z(H1 ),
• |H1 gN| = g −1ηgN,
• G/N is generated by {|H1 gN| | g ∈ G}
Proof. For the first item, we begin by showing that H1 ⊆ HN/N. Let gN ∈ H1 . That is,
qN ·gN = qN. Hence, we must show that g ∈ HN. By Lemma 2.8, qN ·gN = (q·g)·N = q·N,
which implies there exists n ∈ N such that q · g · n = q. Therefore, g · n ∈ H, so g ∈ HN.
Thus, H1 ⊆ HN/N.
Next, we will show HN/N ⊆ H1 . Let hN ∈ HN/N. We must show that qN · hN = qN.
Let q · h · n ∈ q · h · N. Then since q · h = q, q · h · n = q · n ∈ q · N, so q · h · N = q · N. Hence,
by Lemma 2.8, qN · hN = qN. Therefore, hN ⊆ H1 , so HN/N ⊆ H1 Thus, H1 = HN/N.
The second item follows from the functoriality of the augmented quandle structure of
Theorem 2.2.
For the third, let gN ∈ H1 . Then we must show that ηNgN = gNηN. Following
Property 1, |H1 |gN = ηNgN. Since η ∈ Z(H) ⊆ G and N ⊳ G, ηNgN = NηgN. Hence
|H1 |gN = ηNgN = NηgN = NgηN = gNηN = gN|H1|.
For the fourth, following Property 1, we have |H1 gN| = g −1NηNgN = g −1ηNNgN =
g −1 ηNgN since ηN ∈ Z(H1 ). Hence, because N ⊳ G, g −1 ηNgN = g −1 ηgNN = g −1 ηgN.
And finally, since g −1ηg generates G, so by Property 3, g −1ηgN = |H1 gN| generates
G/N.
Our next results characterize rigid quotients of connected quandles in a manner analogous
to the way in which Theorems 2.8 and 2.9 characterized connected quandles.
Proposition 3.5. Let c : Q → R be a rigid quotient map with Q a connected quandle, q ∈ Q,
and G = Inn(Q) = Inn(R). Then R is connected and letting H < G (resp. K < G) be the
9

stabilizer of q (resp. c(q)), and identifying Q with H\G and R with K\G as in Theorem
2.8, the following hold:
• K<H
• The augmentation values of the trivial cosets H and K are equal and denoting this
element of G by η, we have η ∈ Z(K) ∩ H.
• The quandle operations on both quandles are given in terms of cosets by the formulas
of Theorem 2.8.
• G acts faithfully on both H\G and K\G
Proof. First observe that a rigid quotient is necessarily a G-equivariant map. From this it
follows that the stabilizer of an element must be contained in the stablilizer of its image. The
third and fourth conclusions are immediate consequences of Theorem 2.8, so it suffices to
show the second. The entire content of the second statement is that the two augmentation
values are equal, since once this is established, it follows that η lies in both Z(K) and Z(H) <
H by Theorem 2.8. But this follows immediately from the functoriality of augmentations in
Inn(−) with respect to surjective quandle homomorphisms.
Having characterized both rigid quotients and orbit quotients of connected quandles in
terms of their presentation via stabilizer cosets, we turn at last to the question of when the
upper square in our original diagram can be completed so that the one given quotient factors
through the other. As the homomorphism from Q/N1 to Q/N2 is itself an orbit quotient, we
simplify the situation to considering when a solid diagram of the form,
R′

R
c
Q

c′
gN

Q/N

where c and c′ are rigid quotients and gN is an orbit quotient, admits the existence of the
quandle homomorphism indicated by the dotted arrow to complete a commutative square.
10

Without loss of generality we will assume that N is a realizable kernel, so that Inn(Q/N) =
Inn(R′ ) = G/N.
Now if the dotted arrow exists, it must factor as an orbit quotient, followed by a rigid
quotient, giving rise to the dotted portion of the diagram below, in which cN must be a rigid
quotient.
K\G

(K\G)/N

(H\G)/N

The existence of the dotted arrow thus reduces to the condition that the induced map
between the orbit quotients of Q = H\G and R = K\G be a rigid quotient and a condition
for one rigid quotient of connected quandles to factor through another. The first of these is
given by
Theorem 3.6. In the diagram above, cN : (H\G)/N ։ (K\G)/N is a rigid quotient iff
N = N K\G .
Proof. Suppose c is a rigid quotient.

Then Inn((H\G)/N) = Inn(H\G)/N = G/N.

Inn((H\G)/N) = G/N = Inn((K\G)/N). Then Inn(K\G)/N = Inn(H\G)/N so N =
N K\G .
Suppose N = N K\G . Then Inn(K\G)/N K\G = G/N K\G = G/N = Inn(K\G)/N so
Inn(K\G)/N = Inn(H\G)/N = G/N.

Observe that if we had not assumed N was a realizable kernel, the condition would
become N H\G = N K\G .
If this condition holds, the existence of the dotted map to complete the square formed
by an orbit quotient and two given rigid quotients reduces to the question of when one
rigid quotient factors through another. Using the characterization of rigid quotients of
connected quandles given by Proposition 3.5, the necessary and sufficient condition is given
by containment of stabilizer subgroups:
11

Theorem 3.7. Let c : H\G → K\G be defined by c(Hg) = Kg and c′ : H\G → K\G by
c′ (Hg) = Lg be rigid quotients, in both cases with the quandle structure induced by an element
η which must lie in both Z(K) ∩ H and Z(L) ∩ H by Proposition 3.5. Then Φ : K\G → L\G
defined by Φ(Kg) = Lg is a well-defined quandle homomorphism if and only if K ⊂ L, and
moreover is a rigid quotient and the diagram
K\G
Φ

c
H\G

c′

L\G

commutes.
Proof. Let Hg1 , Hg2 ∈ H\G. Since c is a homomorphism, c(Hg1 ⊲ Hg2 ) = c(Hg1 ) ⊲ c(Hg2),
which implies Kg1 g2−1 |H|g2 = Kg1 g2−1|K|g2 . Hence, since G acts faithfully on K\G, |H| =
|K|. Proceeding similarly, c′ (Hg1 ⊲ Hg2 ) = c′ (Hg1 ) ⊲ c′ (Hg2 ), which implies Lg1 g2−1|H|g2 =
Lg1 g2−1|L|g2 . Therefore, |H| = |L|. Thus |K| = |H| = |L|.
Well-defined: Define Φ : K\G → L\G by Φ(Kg) = Lg. First, we will prove that
Φ is well-defined. Let Ka, Kb ∈ K\G. Then Φ(Ka) = La and Φ(Kb) = Lb. Suppose
Ka = Kb. Then by Lemma we have a = k · b for some k ∈ K. Since K ⊂ L, which implies
k ∈ L, La = Lb. Thus, we have Φ(Ka) = La = Lb = Φ(Kb).
Homomorphism: Let Kg1 , Kg2 ∈ K\G. Then Φ(Kg1 ) = Lg1 and Φ(Kg2 ) = Lg2 .
We have Φ(Kg1 ⊲ Kg2 ) = Φ(Kg1 g2−1|K|g2 ) = Lg1 g2−1 |K|g2 and Φ(Kg1 ) ⊲ Φ(Kg2 ) = Lg1 ⊲
Lg2 = Lg1 g2−1 |L|g2 . Since |K| = |L|, we see Lg1 g2−1|K|g2 = Lg1 g2−1 |L|g2 . Hence, Φ is a
homomorphism.
K ⊂ L : Suppose Φ is a well-defined homomorphism. Assume, for the purpose of
contradiction, that K * L. Let Ka ∈ K\G where a ∈ K but a ∈
/ L. Then Φ(Ka) = La.
But Φ(Ka) = Φ(K) = L, which implies La = L and a ∈ L. Thus, by contradiction, K ⊂ L.
Rigidity: This follows immediately from Proposition 3.5.
Commutativity: Having shown that Φ is well-defined, this is immediate by construction.

Directions for Future Research

The present paper has given a complete solution to the problem of when one surjective
quandle homomorphism factors through another in the case where the source and target
quandles of both maps are connected. The fully general problem, in which both simplifying
hypotheses, connectedness and surjectivity, are dropped, appears intractable at the moment.
However, the hypotheses can be weakened bit by bit.
Dropping surjectivity raises the question of how to understand inclusions of connected
quandles into other connected quandles. An adequate understanding of such inclusions
should allow the solution of the more general problem of when one homomorphism between
connected quandles factors through another. It would also come close to solving the problem
in the case where the map through which the first given map is to factor has a connected
source, but an arbitrary target, as the orbit decomposition theorems of [2, 4] reduce that
problem to understanding maps into the connected subquandles arising from the iterated
order decomposition.
The fully general problem could also be attacked in stages according to the “depth” of
the orbit decompositions of the quandles involved (the number of iterations of orbit decomposition needed to reach connnected subquandles), either with or without the surjectivity
condition. The present paper solves the surjective case for depth 0. The previous paragraph
describes an attack on the problem at depth 0, but surjectivity dropped. Another natural
special case to attack next would be factorization conditions for surjective maps between
quandles of depth less than or equal to 1.
