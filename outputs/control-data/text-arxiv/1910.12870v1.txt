ABSTRACT

Observationally, constraining the baryonic cycle within massive galaxies has
proven to be quite difficult. In particular, the role of black hole feedback in regulating star formation, a key process in our theoretical understanding of galaxy formation, remains highly debated. We present here observational evidence showing that,
at fixed stellar velocity dispersion, the temperature of the hot gas is higher for those
galaxies hosting more massive black holes in their centers. Analyzed in the context
of well-established scaling relations, particularly the mass–size plane, the relation between the mass of the black hole and the temperature of the hot gas around massive
galaxies provides further observational support to the idea that baryonic processes
within massive galaxies are regulated by the combined effects of the galaxy halo virial
temperature and black hole feedback, in agreement with the expectations from the
EAGLE cosmological numerical simulation.

INTRODUCTION

Early-type galaxies (ETGs) dominate the massive end of
the galaxy stellar mass function (e.g. Kelvin et al. 2014).
Their relatively simple light profiles (e.g. Kormendy & Bender 2012) and the fact that their stellar populations can be
accurately approximated by single stellar population (SSP)
models (e.g. Vazdekis et al. 1996) have made ETGs observational benchmarks to study the formation and evolution
of galaxies, both locally and at higher redshifts (e.g. Kriek
et al. 2016; Martı́n-Navarro et al. 2018a).
ETGs have historically been thought to result from intense, quasi-dissipationless star formation events in the early
Universe (e.g. Larson 1974). This monolithic-like view of the
formation process of ETGs is observationally supported by
the stellar population properties of these objects. ETGs, and
in particular their stellar populations, follow tight scaling
relations with galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion. With
increasing galaxy mass, ETGs are older, more metal-rich,
and exhibit higher fractions of α to Fe-peak elements (e.g.
Thomas et al. 2005; Johansson et al. 2012). Moreover, there

is now growing observational evidence suggesting that the
stellar initial mass functions in ETGs also change systematically with galaxy mass (e.g. La Barbera et al. 2013). This
tight coupling between galaxy mass and stellar population
properties seems to suggest an in situ formation of the central regions of massive ETGs, since the observed chemical
properties of these objects result from star formation processes that are only sustainable in the center of massive dark
matter halos (e.g. Matteucci 1994).
This more traditional view of massive ETG formation
is, however, at odds with a naı̈ve interpretation of the favored Λ-Cold Dark Matter (Λ-CDM) cosmology. While the
stellar population properties of ETGs show that more massive galaxies formed faster and earlier, the Λ-CDM scenario
predicts a bottom-up structure growth where massive halos
form later out of the accretion of smaller satellites (e.g. Blumenthal et al. 1984). This hierarchical formation process is
not only supported by theoretical arguments, but also by
observations suggesting that massive galaxies have grown in
size over cosmic time (e.g. Daddi et al. 2005; Trujillo et al.
2006).
Differences between the two formation scenarios, topdown vs bottom-up, are ultimately related to differences in

the baryonic cycle. Under the top-down interpretation, stellar ejecta are recycled into new stars with an efficiency
roughly determined by the balance between local escape
velocity and the speed of the stellar winds (e.g. Franx &
Illingworth 1990). More massive ETGs would have a deeper
potential well, which would lead to a more efficient retention
of chemically-enriched gas available to form new generations
of stars. This would naturally produce massive and metalrich ETGs and a relation between escape velocity and the
chemical properties of massive ETGs (e.g. Davies et al. 1993;
Scott et al. 2009). However, from the point of view of current
Λ-CDM numerical simulations, massive ETGs live within
dark matter halos more massive than ∼ 1012 M , where the
baryonic cycle is supposed to be dominated by the effects of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback (e.g. Silk & Mamon
2012). In this case, it is expected that the chemical enrichment is regulated by the thermodynamics of stellar ejecta
within the hot gaseous halos around massive galaxies. If
these gaseous halos are hot enough, either via shock heating
(e.g. Birnboim & Dekel 2003) or due to the energy released
by AGN activity (e.g. Sijacki et al. 2015), low-entropy stellar ejecta may be trapped by the high entropy surroundings,
eventually being recycled into new, metal-rich stars (Bower
et al. 2017). This hot corona would also prevent long-lasting
star formation events fueled by accreting fresh cold gas, although the existence of a hot corona might not be enough
to fully suppress star formation (e.g. Su et al. 2019).

It has been recently shown that star formation histories
(Martı́n-Navarro et al. 2018b; Martı́n-Navarro & Mezcua
2018), chemical enrichment (Martı́n-Navarro et al. 2016),
and present-day star formation rates (Terrazas et al. 2016,
2017) within massive galaxies depend, at fixed galaxy mass
or velocity dispersion, on the masses of the central supermassive black holes. These observational results suggest
that, as expected from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, the effect of black hole feedback plays a critical role
in regulating star formation as it is thought to contribute
to the heating of the gaseous envelope within massive halos.
However, observationally, the link between black hole activity and the heating of the gaseous corona remains a matter
of debate (Bogdán & Goulding 2015; Lakhchaura et al. 2019;
Gaspari et al. 2019). Does the temperature of the gas surrounding massive galaxies correlate with the mass of the
central super-massive black holes? Or, in the context of the
top-down vs bottom-up scenarios, does stellar ejecta fall towards the centers of massive galaxies because its velocity is
lower than the escape velocity or does it sink because its
entropy is lower than that of the surrounding gaseous halo?

In this work, we explore the connection between supermassive black holes, stellar population properties, and hot
gas temperature in the context of massive galaxy evolution.
At fixed stellar velocity dispersion we find a clear correlation between X-ray temperature and black hole mass, as
presented in § 2. In § 3, we propose an alternative method
to study the black hole–galaxy connection when direct black
hole mass measurements are not available. The implications
of these findings are discussed in § 4, and the conclusions
are summarized in § 5.

THE TGAS – σ RELATION

In order to study the interplay between gas temperature
and black hole activity, we followed the same approach as in
Martı́n-Navarro et al. (2016). In short, the basic idea consists
of using the relation between black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion (M• -σ) as a metric for the amount of feedback injected into a given galaxy. Assuming that the energy
radiated by a growing black hole scales with its mass, and
that a fraction of that energy gets coupled to the gas in
the galaxy (e.g. Sijacki et al. 2007; Booth & Schaye 2009),
more energy would have been injected via AGN activity in
those objects hosting more massive black holes. In practice
this means that the distance of a galaxy from the average
M• -σ relation (∆M• ) directly correlates with the (relative)
amount of black hole feedback experienced during its evolution, independently from the initial mass of the black hole
seeds (Mezcua 2017). Therefore, by comparing the properties of galaxies above and below the M• -σ relation, so-called
over-massive and under-massive black hole galaxies, respectively, one can empirically assess the effect of black hole
feedback on the baryonic cycle of galaxies.

2.1

Stellar masses, black holes, and X-ray
temperatures

We base our analysis on the sample of black hole masses presented in van den Bosch (2016), consisting of 230 galaxies
where black hole masses have been dynamically measured.
All the galaxies in the sample are at z ≈ 0, and they cover a
stellar mass range from ∼ 1010 to ∼ 1012 M . Most of these
objects are ETGs, particularly on the massive end (van den
Bosch 2016). In addition to black hole masses, the catalog
presented in van den Bosch (2016) also provides stellar velocity dispersion measurements at a fixed aperture of one
effective radius Re . Stellar masses are also given thanks to
an homogeneous analysis of K-band imaging from the Two
Micron All Sky Survey (Skrutskie et al. 2006). Throughout
the rest of this work, all the discussion is based on the stellar velocity dispersions and masses listed in van den Bosch
(2016).
We crossmatched this sample with two catalogs of Xray temperature measurements, Kim & Fabbiano (2015) and
Goulding et al. (2016). Both works measured the temperature of the hot gaseous component within ∼1Re by fitting
the X-ray spectrum in the ∼ 0.3 to 5 keV energy range.
The Kim & Fabbiano (2015) sample focused on the ATLAS3D project (Cappellari et al. 2011), a volume-limited
survey of nearby ETGs. Complementarily, Goulding et al.
(2016) presented an X-ray study of the MASSIVE survey
(Ma et al. 2014), which complements the ATLAS3D project
by including galaxies with stellar masses above 1011 M .
Thus, these measurements probe the hot gaseous corona
within the stellar component rather than in the galaxy halos. Our final sample consists of 50 galaxies with direct black
hole mass, stellar velocity dispersion, and X-ray gas temperature measurements. Out of these 50 galaxies, 37 belong to the ATLAS3D project, while the remaining 17 were
drawn from the MASSIVE sample. Moreover, only 12 objects belong to the Virgo cluster, while the others reside in
less dense environments. Note that, because of the selection

stars have the same kinetic energy, while dashed lines indicate
+0.15, +0.25, and +0.35 keV increments in the temperature of

black hole, suggesting a connection between black hole growth and
coronal gas temperature at fixed velocity dispersion. The inset

different mass regimes. While ATLAS3D contains numerous relatively low-mass, fast-rotators, MASSIVE is heavily
biased towards the massive, slow-rotator ETG population.
Therefore, the two samples probe not only different sets of
galaxies but also galaxies that have likely undergone different evolutionary processes.

2.2

Dependence of Tgas on black hole mass

In Figure 1 we show the observed dependence of the coronal
gas temperature as a function of galaxy velocity dispersion
for over-massive and under-massive black hole galaxies. The
overall trend, as previously reported, follows a relation of
roughly Tgas ∼ σ 1.5 (see, e.g., Davis & White 1996). In addition, the observed Tgas values for both over-massive and
under-massive black hole galaxies are higher than expected
from virial arguments, indicating that additional mechanisms contribute to heating the gas (Davis & White 1996;
Goulding et al. 2016).
However, the most striking feature shown by Figure 1
is the clear separation between over-massive and undermassive black hole galaxies. Galaxies hosting more massive
black holes exhibit systematically higher Tgas . Moreover,
the temperature difference between over- and under-massive
black hole galaxies is a strong function of galaxy velocity
dispersion and therefore of black hole mass. For galaxies
with log σ ∼ 2.2 km s−1 the temperature difference is ∼ 0.1
keV. In contrast, for the most massive galaxies in our sample, with log σ ∼ 2.5, over-massive black hole galaxies have

where ∆Tgas and ∆M• are the differences in gas temperature and in black hole mass between over-massive and undermassive black hole galaxies at fixed velocity dispersion, respectively, k is the Boltzmann constant, and the quoted uncertainties in the coefficients correspond to the formal 1σ
errors. Eq. 1 models the differential change in coronal gas
temperature and black hole mass at a given stellar velocity dispersion, and suggests that heating due to black hole
feedback scales (sub-linearly) with black hole mass. An alternative way to express the relation between Tgas and M• for
our sample of galaxies is given by the following best-fitting
equation:

where Tgas and M• refer to coronal gas temperatures and
black hole mass measurements for individual galaxies in our
sample, respectively. As before, k is the Boltzmann constant
and uncertainties in Eq. 2 are 1σ formal errors.
Fig. 1 and its parametrization in Eqs. 1 and 2 reveal a
strong correlation between X-ray gas temperatures, galaxy
velocity dispersions and black hole masses in our sample
of low-z massive galaxies. Moreover, the fact that X-ray
temperatures more closely correlate with black hole masses
rather than with the stellar velocity dispersions suggest that
the black holes likely have an important role in controlling
the internal temperatures of massive halos. It is worth emphasizing again that these X-ray temperature measurements
are limited to the central (r ∼Re ) regions of our galaxies and
therefore not directly related to the circumgalactic medium
(CGM). However, observations show that galaxies with hotter X-ray gas in their inner regions also exhibit hotter CGMs
out to r ∼ 10Re (e.g. Fukazawa et al. 2006; Diehl & Statler
2008), supporting the idea that the thermodynamical properties of the outer CGM are, at least, partially coupled to
those of the inner gaseous corona probed by Fig. 1.

BEYOND THE M• -σ RELATION

Studies coupling the baryonic properties of galaxies with the
mass of the central super-massive black hole are providing
compelling observational evidence for the role of black hole
feedback in regulating the internal thermodynamics of massive dark matter halos, and therefore star formation. However, the analysis presented in Fig. 1 can only be done at
z ∼ 0 as it faces an unavoidable limitation: direct black
hole mass measurements are restricted to relatively nearby
systems in the local Universe where the sphere of influence
of the black hole can be resolved. This not only limits the
number of objects feasibly studied but also might introduce
biases in the analysis (e.g. Shankar et al. 2019). In order to
provide a coherent and comprehensive observational picture,
it is then necessary to investigate alternative metrics that do
not require direct black hole mass measurements.
Figure 2 shows the M• -M? relation based on the full
sample of van den Bosch (2016). Each galaxy is color coded

by ∆ log σ, i.e., the difference between its measured velocity dispersion and the expected velocity dispersion given its
stellar mass (determined by the best-fitting σ–M? relation,
see Appendix A). From Figure 2 it becomes clear that, at
fixed stellar mass, galaxies with more massive black holes
also have higher velocity dispersions. This is ultimately due
to the fact that black hole mass correlates more strongly
with σ than with stellar mass (e.g. Ferrarese & Merritt 2000;
Gebhardt et al. 2000; Gültekin et al. 2009; Beifiori et al.
2012; van den Bosch 2016). In principle, this could be a
powerful tool because it implies that it is not necessary to
directly measure black hole masses in order to study the effect of black hole feedback on their host galaxies (e.g. Yu
& Tremaine 2002; Marconi et al. 2004; McLure & Dunlop
2004).
Before further applying σ as a proxy for black hole
mass, it is necessary to show that this approach leads to reasonable results. Figure 3 shows age and [α/Fe] trends with
galaxy velocity dispersion and stellar mass for over-massive
and under-massive black hole galaxies based on two different
approaches. In these plots, ages are SSP-equivalent measurements, while [α/Fe] indicates the mass ratio of α elements
to iron. Because the latter is mainly produced in Type Ia
supernovae and α elements are synthesized in very massive,
short-lived stars, [α/Fe] effectively probes the duration of
star formation in galaxies (Thomas et al. 2005, although a
certain IMF slope has to be assumed, Martı́n-Navarro 2016).
High and low [α/Fe] ratios indicate short and long star formation events, respectively.
The left panels in Figure 3 show the differences between over-massive and under-massive black hole galaxies
as a function of velocity dispersion. The data points come
from Martı́n-Navarro et al. (2016) and the separation between over- and under-massive black hole galaxies is based
on direct black hole mass measurements. On the right, we

show the age and [α/Fe] estimations from the ATLAS3D
survey (McDermid et al. 2015) as a function of stellar mass.
In this case, the distinction between over-massive and undermassive is based on the M? -σ relation. The similarities between the left and right panels are clear, showing that varying the black hole mass at fixed velocity dispersion leads
to a change in the stellar population properties similar to
that observed when varying the velocity dispersion at fixed
stellar mass1 .
The use of proxies to estimate black hole masses in large
samples of galaxies is obviously not a new idea, and has
been extensively used to explore the co-evolution between
galaxies and black holes (e.g. Benson et al. 2007; Kelly &
Merloni 2012; Lang et al. 2014; Bluck et al. 2014; Woo et al.
2015; Krajnović et al. 2018). Figure 3 further develops this
idea by showing that, to first order, one can use σ to probe
galaxies with different black hole masses (at fixed stellar
mass). However, some important caveats must be considered
when following this approach. First, the intrinsic scatter in
the M• -σ relation is not zero (e.g. van den Bosch 2016).
Therefore, a simple change in σ at a given stellar mass does
not fully account for the total change in black hole mass and
its possible effect on the star formation histories (Martı́nNavarro et al. 2018b). Second, changes in velocity dispersion
are also associated with changes in the internal structure of
galaxies (e.g. Graham & Scott 2013; Sahu et al. 2019) and
even due to changes in orientation (e.g. Xiao et al. 2011).
Therefore, discussing the effect of black hole feedback based
on velocity dispersion measurements should be cautiously
treated, controlling for any possible confounding variables.
Finally, the mapping between black hole mass and σ might
change with galaxy mass (e.g. Krajnović et al. 2018; Shankar
et al. 2019) and even with redshift. Thus, interpreting trends
as a function of galaxy or halo mass might lead to biased
results (Bernardi et al. 2007).

DISCUSSION

There is now growing evidence suggesting that the baryonic properties of massive galaxies, namely their ages, star
formation rates, and chemical composition, are tightly coupled to the masses of their central super-massive black
holes (Martı́n-Navarro et al. 2016, 2018b; Martı́n-Navarro
& Mezcua 2018; Terrazas et al. 2016, 2017). The observed
relation between black holes and coronal gas temperature
described in § 2 provides further observational evidence for
a scenario where the star formation in massive galaxies is
regulated by the energetic input from the central black hole.
In this scenario, the energy released by a black hole during its growth couples with the hot gaseous corona around
massive galaxies, heating the gas above the expected virial
temperature. This heating is proportional to the mass of the
black hole and would naturally explain the observed properties of ETGs.

Age differences in Martı́n-Navarro et al. (2016) are larger than
those found in McDermid et al. (2015) because the former used
line-strength indices, which are more biased towards young stellar
populations. Note also that while ATLAS3D is limited to ETGs,
the Martı́n-Navarro et al. (2016) sample includes later types, in
particular for lower-mass galaxies.

Figure 3. On the left, adapted from Martı́n-Navarro et al. (2016), age-σ (top) and [α/Fe]-σ (bottom) trends are shown for overmassive and under-massive black hole galaxies. The distinction between over- and under-massive was based on direct black hole mass
measurements. On the right, equivalent trends from the ATLAS3D survey (McDermid et al. 2015), where over-massive and under-massive
black hole galaxies are those with high and low velocity dispersions, respectively. The fact that left and right panels show consistent trends
further supports the idea of using stellar velocity dispersions in large and representative samples if direct black hole mass measurements
are not available.

Numerical simulations suggest that a ballistic scenario,
where stellar ejecta are recycled into new stars in a process
regulated by the escape velocity of the galaxy, is not feasible for galaxies more massive than M& 1010.5 M , where
the effect of AGN feedback is expected to become dominant
(Scannapieco & Brüggen 2015; Bower et al. 2017; Nelson
et al. 2019). Our results, summarized in Figure 1, favor a
scenario where the baryonic cycle within massive galaxies
is driven by a thermodynamic equilibrium between stellar
ejecta and the surrounding hot corona (Bower et al. 2017),
whose temperature is controlled by both the mass (or virial
temperature) of the dark matter halo and the energy input from the central super-massive black hole. This picture,
combined with the realization that the M• -M? plane can be
approximated by the σ-M? plane (although with important
caveats as discussed in § 3), have direct implications on our
understanding of ETGs.

4.1

Re-thinking the mass–size plane

The mass–size plane, popularized by the ATLAS3D team
(e.g. Cappellari et al. 2013a), can be understood as a projection of the size-luminosity-velocity dispersion space, i.e.,
of the fundamental plane of ETGs (e.g. Bender et al. 1992),
and it is a powerful framework for understanding the formation and evolution of massive galaxies. One of the most
MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2018)

striking features of the mass–size plane is the fact that the
properties of galaxies smoothly transition following lines of
constant velocity dispersion (e.g. Cappellari et al. 2013b;
Cappellari 2016). This is exemplified in Figure 4, where the
mass–size plane from the ATLAS3D survey is shown, colorcoded by the quenching time-scales of galaxies (defined as
t50 in McDermid et al. 2015). Dashed lines of constant velocity dispersion are shown in grey, assuming that galaxies are
virialized following M? = 5Re σ/G (Cappellari et al. 2013b),
where G is the gravitational constant.
The combination of Figure 1 and Figure 2 allows us
to propose that, in the mass–size plane, the stellar population properties of galaxies (e.g. abundance pattern, age, and
metallicity, see McDermid et al. 2015) follow lines of constant σ, which, given the tight relation between σ, M• , and
Tgas (Eq. 2), can be also interpreted as lines of constant gas
temperature (note the quantities labeled accordingly in Figure 4). Moreover, Fig. 1 suggests that this gas temperature is
ultimately determined by the mass (or virial temperature) of
the galaxy plus the additional energetic input from the central super-massive black hole. The apparent trends between
stellar population properties and galaxy velocity dispersion
(McDermid et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018)
would be then just a consequence of the fact that σ strongly
depends on both halo and black hole mass, while the stellar
mass of a galaxy is mostly just probing the mass of its dark

6

Figure 4. Mass – size plane of ETGs from the ATLAS3D survey (Cappellari et al. 2013a), color-coded by quenching time-scale
(McDermid et al. 2015) using the LOESS smoothing implementation described in Cappellari et al. (2013b), as a proxy for the
effect of black hole feedback on regulating star formation. Diagonal dashed lines indicate lines of constant velocity dispersion,
which closely track the observed changes in galaxy properties
across the mass – size plane. Following Figure 1 and Figure 2,
lines of constant σ can be approximated as lines of constant M• ,
and therefore of constant gas temperature (as labeled on each diagonal line). We hypothesize that the physical mechanism behind
the observed stellar population trends in the mass – size plane is
actually a combination of potentially accreting gas being shockheated to the virial temperature of the halo and the additional
energy released from the central super-massive black hole. Note
that these are all of the ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample, not our
sub-sample shown in Figure 1.

matter halo. The role of black hole heating in regulating
the properties of galaxies across the mass–size plane, and in
particular the quenching efficiency, is further supported by
the fact that the fraction and amount of cold gas decreases
with increasing velocity dispersion (Cappellari et al. 2013b;
Davis et al. 2019).
In order to test this black hole heating scenario, we
made use of the publicly available database of the EAGLE
cosmological simulation (McAlpine et al. 2016). In particular, we compared their predictions for the mass–size plane
in a simulated volume of 50 Mpc with and without black
hole feedback. All measurements correspond to a fixed aperture of 30 kpc and we have only included galaxies with with
a stellar masses M ? > 5 · 109 M . Although the EAGLE
project does not offer predictions for the quenching timescale as defined in Fig. 4, it provides an estimation of the
sSFR. In practice, both quantities are approximately equivalent since a longer quenching time-scale (bluer colors in
Fig. 4) implies a more extended star formation history and,
therefore, a higher sSFR at z=0. The connection between
quenching time-scale and sSFR is also empirically supported
by the fact that, at fixed stellar mass or velocity dispersion, galaxies with lower sSFR (Terrazas et al. 2016) are
also those exhibiting older ages and shorter quenching timescales (Martı́n-Navarro 2016). The comparison of the prop-

erties of the mass–size plane with and without the effect of
AGN feedback is shown in Fig. 5.
According to the EAGLE cosmological simulation,
AGN feedback has two main effects on the mass–size plane.
First, it helps to reproduce the size of the most massive
galaxies that otherwise would be too small compared to what
is observed. Moreover, the effect of AGN feedback is needed
to efficiently quench star formation (Crain et al. 2015). Otherwise, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 5, massive galaxies
continue forming stars at a much higher rate than observed
(e.g. Scholtz et al. 2018).
Second, variations of galaxy properties along diagonal
lines of constant velocity dispersion (dashed lines in Fig. 5)
emerge from this AGN feedback. In the absence of feedback, lines of constant sSFR are nearly horizontal (see Appendix B). Therefore, at least in this state-of-the-art cosmological simulation, the observed relation between stellar
population properties and stellar velocity dispersion seems
to be a consequence of black hole heating.
It is important to note here that in Fig. 5 we selected all
galaxies more massive than 5 × 109 M in the EAGLE simulation without applying any morphological selection, while
the ATLAS3D sample shown in Fig. 4 only contains ETGs.
Therefore, the comparison between these two figures is only
an approximate assessment of the possible effect of black
hole feedback in massive galaxies.
4.2

Stellar population scaling relations: M? vs σ

In a Λ-CDM Universe, halo mass is thought to be the main
quantity regulating galaxy evolution (e.g. Behroozi et al.
2013). It is still debated whether galaxy stellar mass or σ is
a better proxy for halo mass (e.g. Li et al. 2013; Zahid et al.
2016; Tinker et al. 2017), yet stellar population properties
in massive ETGs correlate much better with galaxy velocity
dispersion than with stellar mass (e.g. Trager et al. 2000;
Bernardi et al. 2005; Gallazzi et al. 2006; Graves et al. 2009).
Barone et al. (2018) have recently proposed that it is the
gravitational potential log Φ ∝ log σ that ultimately determines the stellar population properties, since galaxies with
deeper potential wells, and therefore with higher escape velocities, are more efficient at retaining their stellar ejecta.
However, as described above, it is unlikely that the gravitational potential plays a significant role in a mass range
(M? & 1010 M ) where the baryonic cycle is expected to
be dominated by the effect of black hole feedback. Moreover, X-ray gas temperatures (Fig. 1) and stellar population
properties (Martı́n-Navarro et al. 2016) change with black
hole mass at fixed σ, and therefore, at fixed Φ (e.g. Barone
et al. 2018), assuming that galaxies are virialized systems.
It is worth noting that, because of this virialized nature of
galaxies, σ, φ, and black hole mass are expected to track
each other (e.g. van den Bosch 2016), although the details
of these scaling relations depend on other processes such as
galaxy mergers (e.g. Tapia et al. 2014), or black hole mass
accretion history (e.g. Davé et al. 2019). It is precisely these
second order effects over the dominant virial behavior of
galaxies that we argue allows our relative assessment of the
effect of black hole feedback.
Figure 4 presents a suggestive scenario to explain why
stellar populations better correlate with σ than with M? . At
fixed stellar mass, galaxies exhibit a wide range of black hole

Figure 5. Mass – size plane in the Eagle cosmological simulation with (left panel) and without (right panel) AGN feedback. All galaxies
more massive than 5×109 M are shown here, color-coded by their sSFR (as measured over a 30 kpc aperture). As in Fig. 4, the colorcoding has been optimized with a LOESS smoothing scheme (Cappellari et al. 2013b). The color bar saturates at log sSFR < −10.8 to
emphasize the two-dimensional color distribution. In the absence of AGN feedback, neither the morphology nor the color-coding follows
the observational trends of Fig. 4. Thus, as expected from a black hole-driven scenario, it is the effect of AGN feedback on the baryonic
cycle of massive galaxies that determines their stellar population properties through a cumulative heating of the gas. For reference,
dashed lines are lines of constant velocity dispersion assuming that galaxies are virialized. Note that the lines are not the same as in
Fig. 4, because the virial mass estimator described in Cappellari et al. (2013b) was calibrated with a fixed aperture of 1 Re , whereas the
EAGLE measurements correspond to an aperture of 30 kpc.

masses and therefore of hot gas temperatures. Thus, if black
holes are responsible for heating the gas above the virial
temperature (set by the halo mass), and this change in the
thermodynamics in dark matter halos affects the stellar population properties over time, a large scatter is expected. On
the other hand, the stellar velocity dispersion does not only
encode information about the halo mass, but also about the
mass of the black hole, making σ a suitable predictor for stellar population properties when direct black hole mass measurements are not available (see § 3 for a discussion about
the caveats of using σ as black hole mass proxy.). Our joint
analysis of direct black hole mass measurements and X-ray
temperatures builds on previous observational efforts suggesting a connection between σ, black hole mass, and the
star formation histories of massive galaxies (e.g. Wake et al.
2012; Bell et al. 2012). This simple idea is able to unify in
a coherent and physically motivated picture the observed
properties of ETGs (see e.g. Cappellari 2016) and their dependence on galaxy mass (e.g. Terrazas et al. 2016, 2017)
and velocity dispersion (Martı́n-Navarro et al. 2016, 2018b).

Black holes and the circumgalactic medium

Above, we have sketched a scenario where we have connected
our observed correlation between the black hole mass (and,
as a rough proxy, the velocity dispersion) and the X-ray
emitting gas temperature in ETGs with the observed stellar population properties. This relation between black holes,
stellar populations, and X-ray temperatures, although only
probed close to the center of the halo (r ∼Re ), may also
extend out to large radii (e.g. Fukazawa et al. 2006; Diehl &
Statler 2008). A remaining connection is needed to complete
the story as to how the black hole mass and stellar popuMNRAS 000, 1–9 (2018)

lations are coupled. We have mentioned that heating the
gaseous halo, or CGM, can trap the metal-enriched stellar
ejecta and prevent fresh gas from fueling further star formation. Because we have shown that energy injection from
the black hole appears to have heated the gas in the central
galactic regions, effects should be observable in the CGM
and illuminate the quenching mechanisms further.
Modern hydrodynamic simulations indeed show profound impacts on the CGM from black hole feedback. In the
IllustrisTNG simulations, the amount of Ovi in the CGM
is highly dependent on the z ∼ 0 black hole mass, as the
metals are pushed further out into the halo and the halo is
heated from accumulated black hole feedback (Nelson et al.
2018; Terrazas et al. 2019). The EAGLE simulations also
show profound effects on the CGM from black hole feedback; the gas mass fraction in the halo is reduced (Davies
et al. 2019) in galaxies with more massive black holes. Oppenheimer et al. (2019) predict that Civ is a good tracer of
this CGM clearing, and galaxies at fixed stellar mass should
exhibit a lower covering fraction of Civ in the halo with increased M• . Furthermore, Oppenheimer et al. (2019) show
that galaxies with lowered CGM gas mass fractions evolve
secularly away from the ‘blue cloud’, as their galaxy samples
were controlled to have histories free of major mergers over
several Gyr.
Intriguingly, Burchett et al. (2016) find a wide range
of Civ column density in their highest mass galaxies, although no black hole information was known. These tracers
are best observed in ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of
background quasars or galaxies and thus rely on fortuitous
alignments of galaxies and UV-bright background source.
Berg et al. (2018) compared CGM properties of opticallyselected AGN hosts versus a sample with no AGN and found

8

no significant differences between the two populations. However, the key parameter we focus on in this work and the parameter that drives the differences in CGM tracers within
the simulations is the mass of the black hole, not its current
accretion rate. Using velocity dispersion as a proxy for black
hole mass could significantly aid building samples of quasargalaxy pairs suitable for studying the impacts of black hole
feedback on the CGM of massive ETGs.

CONCLUSIONS

Massive ETGs stand as a benchmark for extra-galactic
astronomy, challenging our understanding of galaxy formation even after decades of thorough study. Among all of the
open questions, their quenching processes and baryon cycle
in general are yet to be fully understood. We have presented
here evidence of a relation between the temperature of the
hot gas in massive ETGs and the mass of the central supermassive black hole. This result, in combination with the observed scaling relations between black hole and galaxy mass,
stellar velocity dispersion, and stellar population properties,
observationally supports the idea that black hole heating is a
fundamental mechanism regulating the formation and evolution of massive galaxies. A comparison between the observed
mass-size plane of ETGs and the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations also supports the key
role of black hole heating in this simulation because black
hole feedback is needed to reproduce realistic star formation
histories of massive galaxies, ultimately leading to the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, size, σ, and
stellar population properties.
Our results roughly describe an interpretative framework where black hole feedback has a critical role in heating
the gaseous halos around massive galaxies beyond the virial
temperature, modifying the internal thermodynamics, and
therefore affecting the cooling efficiency and the observed
stellar population properties. In order to fully explore this
scenario, it is necessary to increase the samples of objects
with direct black hole mass measurements and to understand the connections to other important galaxy properties
such as internal structure or large-scale environment. Future
facilities such as James Webb Space Telescope, and in particular the upcoming 30-meter class telescopes, will be key
in our understanding of the galaxy-black hole coevolution
(e.g. Gültekin et al. 2019).

Figure A1. M? –σ relation for the sample presented in van den
Bosch (2016), where the best-fitting trend is shown as a dashed
line. Symbols are color-coded as a function of their distance with
respect to the average M? –M• relation. Dashed line indicates the
average M? –σ relation. This figure, along with Fig. 2, shows that
for a given stellar mass galaxies hosting more massive black holes
tend to also have higher stellar velocity dispersions.

APPENDIX A: THE M? –σ RELATION
Fig. A1 shows the relation between the stellar velocity dispersion measured at 1Re and the total stellar mass, as measured by van den Bosch (2016). The color code is the same
as in Fig. 2 and indicates the distance with respect to the
best-fitting relation. Galaxies that, at a given stellar mass,
have higher stellar velocity dispersions also host more massive black holes. Therefore, the scatter in Fig. A1 can be
used to probe, at first order (see caveats detailed in § 3),
the possible effects of black hole feedback in the host galaxy
when direct black hole mass measurements are not available.

APPENDIX B: MASS–SIZE PLANE IN EAGLE
WITHOUT AGN FEEDBACK
Similarly to the right panel in Fig. 5, Fig. B1 shows the
mass–size plane of the EAGLE cosmological simulation
without the effect of AGN feedback but in this case the color
range has been adapted to show how the lines of constant
sSFR are not diagonal, but roughly horizontal. This is due
to the fact that, in EAGLE, sSFR is largely driven by the
effect of black hole feedback.
This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by
the author.

Figure B1. Mass–size plane of the EAGLE simulation. This figure is the same as Fig. 5 but the color coding has been changed
to show that, without black hole feedback, lines of constant sSFR
are rather horizontal. This further supports the idea that black
holes play a critical role in shaping the observed stellar population
properties of massive galaxies, at least in the EAGLE cosmological simulation.
