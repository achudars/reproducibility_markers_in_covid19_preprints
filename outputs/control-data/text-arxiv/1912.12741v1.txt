Rapid progress in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics techniques enabled the creation of
ultracold samples of molecular species and opened opportunities to explore chemistry in the ultralow
temperature regime. In particular, both the external and internal quantum degrees of freedom of
the reactant atoms and molecules are controlled, allowing studies that explored the role of the longrange potential in ultracold reactions. The kinetics of these reactions have typically been determined
using the loss of reactants as proxies. To extend such studies into the short-range, we developed
an experimental apparatus that combines the production of quantum-state-selected ultracold KRb
molecules with ion mass and kinetic energy spectrometry, and directly observed KRb + KRb reaction
intermediates and products [Science, 2019, 366, 1111]. Here, we present the apparatus in detail. For
future studies that aim for detecting the quantum states of the reaction products, we demonstrate
a photodissociation based scheme to calibrate the ion kinetic energy spectrometer at low energies.

1 Introduction
Over the past decades, colder and more precisely quantumcontrolled molecular samples have been hotly pursued in the
AMO community for a diverse range of applications including precision measurements 1‚Äì3 , quantum simulations 4‚Äì6 , and quantum
computation 7‚Äì10 . These works aim to take advantage of the electric dipole moments and manifolds of internal states possessed
by molecules as reviewed in a previous PCCP perspective 11 and
other references 12,13 . Furthermore, cold molecules offer a new
platform to explore chemistry 14 , which is the main topic of this
perspective. While the ‚Äúultracold‚Äù regime is characterized by single partial wave collisions (s-wave for identical bosons and distinguishable particles, p-wave for identical fermions), which typically occurs below 1 millikelvin, our discussion here also includes
the ‚Äúcold‚Äù regime, which loosely refers to collision energies up to
a few kelvin.
To understand chemical reactions in the cold regime, we divide
the underlying potential energy surface (PES) into asymptotic,
long-range, and short-range portions 15 as shown in Fig 1. Reactants are prepared in well-defined quantum states in the asymptotpic region and are set on a collision course. Long-range forces,
such as centrifugal and electrostatic terms, govern the approach
between the reactants, while short-range forces determine the
dynamics of the intermediate complex and the formation of the
products. Since the collision energy is extremely low, a reaction
can occur only if the short-range is a potential well, not a barrier. As a result, reactants that proceed into the short-range will
form a transient intermediate complex. This complex, in the absence of dissipative processes, will either dissociate back into reactants (for endothermic reactions) or continue to form products
(for exothermic reactions). Below, we survey past and ongoing
work for studying long- and short-range dynamics in cold molecular systems, with relevant concepts and techniques illustrated in
Fig. 1.

At sufficiently low temperatures, the collision energy is comparable or smaller than the energy scale of the long-range interaction between reactants. As a result, long-range forces can profoundly influence the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions,
unlike in higher temperature reactions. Moreover, the form of the
long-range PES is in many cases directly tied to the internal quantum states of the reactants, enabling quantum control over reactions through internal state manipulation. For example, quantum
statistics of the reactants can dictate the lowest partial waves allowed in collisions. For s-wave, the reactants can proceed directly
to the short-range, while for p-wave they must tunnel through a
centrifugal barrier to reach the short-range. Consequently, quantum statistics controlled reaction rates that differ by a factor of 10100 were observed 20 . Introducing dipole-dipole interactions by
polarizing the molecules in an electric field can significantly enhance their chemical reactivity 21 and additionally confining them
in reduced dimensions can further alter their reactivity 22 . Large
dipolar interactions can lead to collisions with contributions from
many partial waves, resulting in highly anisotropic interactions
between molecules 23 . Long-range interactions can be further
modified by electronically exciting one of the reactants, in which
case effects like the radiative lifetime 24 and orbital shape 25 of
the excited state become significant to subsequent reaction rates.
In all of the above studies, reactant loss or product appearance serve as proxies to the overall reaction rate determined by
the long-range potential. In the case of scattering resonances,
the reaction rate also depends sensitively on the short-range PES.
A resonance arises when the scattering state of the reactants or
products becomes strongly coupled to a bound or quasi-bound
state of the intermediate complex. Resonances involving quasibound states are known as ‚Äúshape resonances‚Äù, while those involving true bound states are known as ‚ÄúFeshbach resonances‚Äù.
While resonances are typically obscured by the effects of thermal
averaging in higher temperature reactions, they become resolved
in cold reactions where collision energies are low and narrowly
distributed. Observations of shape resonances have been made
in both photodissociation 26 and Penning ionization 27 reactions,
providing benchmark tests for the accuracy of the highest-level
ab initio surfaces. Feshbach resonances play an important role

Fig. 1 Schematic PES (not to scale) of a barrierless, exothermic cold reaction along some reaction coordinate, divided into asymptotic, long-range,
and short-range portions. Experimental techniques that are sensitive to the different portions are illustrated in white boxes accordingly. Reactants are
prepared with low collision energies and in well-defined quantum states in the asymptotic region. They approach each other under the influence of the
long-range potential, characterized by centrifugal and electrostatic forces. The potential well in the short-range leads to the formation of a transient
intermediate complex, which will proceed further to products in the case of exothermic reactions, or back to reactants in endothermic ones. Though
cold reactions are overall barrierless, submerged barriers, such as illustrated above, are predicted to exist in many reactions 16‚Äì19 .

both atom-molecule 29‚Äì31 and molecule-molecule 32,33 collisions.

onds. The observation of the complex opens up the exciting possibility to directly probing the short-range of the reaction. In the
time-domain, we can ‚Äúclock‚Äù the reaction and make a direct and
more precise measurement of complex lifetime. In the frequencydomain, we can learn more about the structure of the complex
through spectroscopy.

Beyond studying the chemical kinetics of reactants and products, more can be learned about the short-range dynamics directly
by studying the intermediate complex, which is challenging due
to its transient nature. The lifetime of the complex, œÑc , is proportional to the density, œÅc , of internal modes through which the
energy of the complex can be re-distributed, and inversely proportional to number of exit channels, N0 , available for the complex
to dissociate, either into products or reactants 35 . For reactions
of small systems, œÑc is typically no more than on the order of a
rotational period (10 ps), and a direct observation of the complex requires ultrafast techniques 36 . For larger systems the relatively large number of internal modes can extend the lifetime
to as long as microseconds 37 . In the ultracold regime, the lifetime of the complex becomes substantial for even small systems
by preparing the the reactants in their absolute ground rovibronic
state and thereby minimizing N0 . This enabled our direct observation of the intermediate complex K2 Rb‚àó2 , formed by the bimolecular reaction between KRb molecules, without the use of ultrafast
lasers 38 . Through measurement of the equilibrium concentration
of the complex, we estimated the lifetime of the complex to be
on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds to a few microsec-

The short-range PES not only determines the dyanmics of the
complex, but also guides the process of product formation. As
such, studying the quantum states of the products can provide
additional information about the short-range. Product state mapping, while enjoying a long and successful history as a workhorse
technique behind many studies of reaction dynamics in physical
chemistry at large 39 , has seen very few applications to cold chemistry. ‚ÄúThe detection of product states‚Äù was recognized as one of
the ‚Äúmajor milestones that need to be reached for the continued
progress of this field‚Äù by a PCCP editorial on cold molecules in
2011 40 . A challenge to reaching this milestone in AMO experiments is that the techniques used to create and control the reactants are optimized for probing reaction species in a quantum
state-specific manner and do not have the flexibility to study more
than a handful of quantum states at a time, whereas typical chemical reactions liberate enough energy to populate hundreds of
product quantum states or more. Reactions involving single 41 42
or relatively few 43 channels are still amenable to product-state
specific studies using AMO techniques. More generally, however,
mapping out the product state distribution demands an integration of physical chemistry detection techniques into the AMO ex-

perimental infrastructure.
Ultimately, investigating both the intermediate and products
will provide the most comprehensive picture on the short-range
dynamics. This is what we hope to achieve with the ‚Äúultracold
chemistry machine‚Äù to be described in detail in section 3.

2 The platform: KRb, bialkalis, and beyond
We began our exploration of ultracold chemistry by studying
the exchange reaction between ground state potassium-rubidium
molecules

K Rb(v = 0, j = 0) +40 K87 Rb(v = 0, j = 0) ‚Üí K2 Rb‚àó2 ‚Üí K2 + Rb2 ,
(1)
where v and j denote the rotational and vibrational quantum
numbers of the reactants, respectively. The reaction is exothermic with ‚àÜE = ‚àí10.4(4) cm‚àí1 . 20 This reaction was first inferred
by Ospelkaus et al. in 2010 through the detection of reactant
(KRb) loss 20 , and recently confirmed by the detection of the reaction products (K2 and Rb2 ) and the transient intermediate complex (K2 Rb‚àó2 ) in our recent work 38 . The short-range dynamics of
KRb + KRb has been the subject of a number of theoretical studies. Mayle et al. 44 suggests that the long-lived intermediate complex (K2 Rb‚àó2 ) will ergodically explore the available reaction phase
space and the dynamics can be adequately captured by statistical
theory. In this case the complex lifetime can be simply calculated
using the RRKM theory as œÑc = hœÅc /N0 , where h is Planck‚Äôs constant. Based on the assumption of statistical behavior, Gonzalez
et al. 45 calculated the quantum state distribution of the products.
Experimentally, the low exothermicity, and therefore the few accessible product exit channels, makes the reaction amenable to
full product quantum state mapping. Measuring both the product
state distribution and the complex lifetime will provide fundamental tests for the applicability of statistical theory to this reaction. Detecting departures from statistical behavior would in
itself be interesting, and reasons for expecting such departures
are suggested by Nesbitt 46 .
In addition to the molecule-molecule reaction, we can also investigate the atom-molecule reactions

and

For ground-state reactants, reaction 2 is exothermic with ‚àÜE =
‚àí224.972(4) cm‚àí1 , 20 and reaction 3 is endothermic with ‚àÜE =
214.6(4) cm‚àí1 . 20 Reaction 2 was first identified again by Ospelkaus et al. through the observation of rapid KRb loss in
the presence of K atoms 20 . While a four-atom reaction involving heavy alkali atoms such as reaction 1 is still beyond the
current scope of quantum chemistry calculations, numericallyexact quantum dynamics calculations have been reported for K
+ KRb 47 . Product state mapping of reaction 2 will provide valu-

able benchmark to the state-of-the-art theory.
KRb is a member of the bialkali family of molecules, which
are among the first molecular species to be brought into the ultracold regime 48‚Äì51 and, to date, remain the densest, coldest,
and among the best quantum state controlled molecular samples 20,52‚Äì54 . They are a major platform in ultracold chemistry
research, including most of the studies mentioned in the introduction (section 1). While bialkalis will continue to serve as a
rich playground for chemical dynamics for years to come, efforts
are well underway to bring more ‚Äúchemically relevant‚Äù species
into the fold. The trapping of O2 55 in a superconducting magnetic trap and the observation of O2 - O2 collisions 56 represent a
major milestone in increasing the chemical diversity of ultracold
chemistry.

3 The ultracold chemistry machine
As we have illustrated in the introduction (section 1), part of
what makes exploring chemistry in the ultracold regime exciting is the ability to start a reaction with the reactants prepared in
well-defined quantum states. This is made possible by the high
degree of quantum state control in AMO experiments. Ultracold
molecules are typically detected in these experiments through optical (fluorescence and absorption) imaging 57 . This technique
provides powerful visualizations of the spatial configurations of
particles and information such as their number, density, momentum, and temperature. A key requirement for imaging ultracold
matter, where the typical density ranges from 108 to 1014 cm‚àí3 , is
that each molecule can scatter many photons to provide sufficient
signal for detection. This demands molecules prepared in a specific (oftentimes the ground rovibronic) quantum state to repeatedly undergo ‚Äúcycling‚Äù optical transition. While such transitions
are found in many atoms, they are rare in molecules 58‚Äì61 . This
requirement can be side-stepped in ultracold bialkali molecules,
such as KRb, as they can be coherently dissociated into their constituent atoms, which again scatter photons very efficiently (see
section 3.2.2). This scheme has been employed to observe the
loss of reactants in most studies of ultracold bi-alkali chemistry to
date.
When it comes to studying the short-range chemistry, the quantum state specific nature of AMO techniques renders them ineffective, as the intermediate complex and the reaction products exist
in a multitude of quantum states. Ion spectrometry, a tried-andtrue method from the physical chemistry community, provides
a universal and efficient way to detect all species involved in a
reaction. Atoms or molecules involved in the reaction, regardless of their quantum states, can be ionized with UV photons of
sufficiently high energy, and subsequently detected by time-offlight (TOF) mass spectrometry. The velocity map imaging (VMI)
technique 62 enables measurements of the kinetic energy distribution of the ions, from which valuable information on either
the ionization process or the chemical reaction itself can be extracted. Additionally, ion detection has high sensitivity and low
background noise, making it ideal for detecting intermediates and
products which are much less concentrated compared to the reactants. It enabled the observation of a sample of ground state KRb
molecules too dilute (106 cm‚àí3 ) to be optically imaged 63 .

Thus, a comprehensive investigation of ultracold chemical reactions is best achieved by bringing together AMO and physical
chemistry techniques. This is realized in the ‚Äúultracold chemistry
machine‚Äù shown in Fig. 2. The light blue shaded part of the apparatus can produce a mixture of ultracold, state-selected reactant
atoms/molecules on-demand. As the reaction proceeds, the ion
spectrometer in light orange shaded part of the apparatus can detect the reactants, products, and the transient intermediates with
mass and quantum state sensitivity.
3.1

Building the apparatus: divide and conquer

Differences in AMO physics and physical chemistry techniques
bring about many competing apparatus design requirements that
needed to be resolved. Our strategy is to build interconnected
vacuum chambers that each specializes in a set of mutually compatible tasks, and transfer the atoms and molecules in between
them using electric, magnetic, and optical (laser) fields. One notable difference between an ultracold quantum gas apparatus and
a gas-phase reaction dynamics apparatus (e.g. molecular beams)
is the level of vacuum required. While the prior demands a pressure below 10‚àí11 mbar due to the long experimental cycle time
during which the collisions between the ultracold sample and
background particles must be minimized, the latter only requires
10‚àí6 to 10‚àí8 mbar. The multi-chamber design allows the machine
to be built and tested one vacuum chamber at a time. In the event
that air-exposure is needed, the gate valves (G1, G2, and G3 in
Fig. 2) separating the chambers allows the negative impact on

the vacuum to be localized.

3.2.1

Production of ultracold KRb molecules
Atom cooling

The production of ultracold KRb begins with the loading and cooling of the precursor atoms. Bosonic 87 Rb and fermionic 40 K atoms
are first loaded into a dual-species magneto-optical trap (MOT) in
the ‚ÄúMOT‚Äù chamber, a Pyrex glass cell. At this stage, we usually
have 1 √ó 109 Rb atoms (Fig. 2(a)) and 5 √ó 106 K (Fig. 2(b)) atoms.
We further increase the phase-space density (PSD) of the atoms
by optically compressing the Rb MOT and applying gray molasses
cooling to both species 64,65 . We then optically pump the atoms to
their respective stretched hyperfine states (|F, mF i = |2, 2i for 87 Rb
and |9/2, 9/2i for 40 K) before capturing them in a quadrupole
magnetic trap. This trap is formed by the ‚Äútransfer‚Äù coil pair
(Fig. 2(c)), which operates in an anti-Helmholtz configuration
and provides quadrupolar magnetic confinement for the atoms.
The ‚Äútransfer‚Äù coil, mounted on a meter-long transfer track, move
the atoms through vacuum from the ‚ÄúMOT‚Äù chamber into the
‚Äúevaporation‚Äù chamber. The ‚ÄúMOT‚Äù chamber is differentiallypumped with respect to the ‚Äúevaporation‚Äù chamber through a
thin tube (diameter = 10mm, length = 305mm) to maintain
a relatively high vacuum (< 10‚àí11 mbar) inside the evaporation
chamber. Once the atoms arrive at the evaporation chamber,
they are loaded into a harmonic magnetic trap formed by three
coils operated in a quadrupole-in-Ioffe configuration (QUIC) (Fig.

2(e)) 66 . The QUIC trap has a minimum magnetic field value
of 2.5G and trapping frequencies of 2œÄ √ó {116, 116, 22}Hz for Rb
and 2œÄ √ó {171, 171, 33}Hz for K. Radio frequency (RF) evaporation 67,68 is applied to the Rb atoms to reduce the temperature of
the gas while the PSD is increased. K atoms remain in thermal
equilibrium with Rb atoms throughout the evaporation process
and therefore are sympathetically cooled. At the end of the RF
evaporation we produce 4 √ó 106 Rb atoms and 1.5 √ó 106 K atoms
at ‚àº 2.5¬µK. We then transfer the atoms from the QUIC trap into
a focus-tunable optical dipole trap (TODT) formed by a single focused laser beam. The focal position of the TODT can be tuned
smoothly over a distance of 30 cm by translating the position of a
lens mounted on an air-bearing translation stage. Doing so transfers the atoms from the evaporation chamber to the center of the
‚Äúscience‚Äù chamber. Upon arrival, the atoms are loaded into a stationary ‚Äúcrossed‚Äù ODT (XODT) formed by crossing a ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù
beam (HODT) with a 30 ¬µm beam waist and a ‚Äúvertical‚Äù beam
(VODT) with a 100 ¬µm beam waist at near right angle. These
two beams are frequency shifted from each other by 80 MHz to
avoid interference. The arrangement of the ODT beams are illustrated in Fig. 2. All of the ODT beams are generated by a single
1064 nm laser source with a linewidth of 1 kHz.
3.2.2

Molecule creation

To coherently associate the ultracold atoms into ultracold
molecules, we take a two-step approach as demonstrated in
Ref. 69 . We first magneto-associate pairs of free Rb and K atoms
into weakly-bond Feshbach molecules, then transfer the population into the rovibronic ground state via STImulated Raman
Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) 70 . In preparation for the magnetoassociation, the Rb atoms are transferred from the |2, 2i state
into the |1, 1i state via a microwave-driven adiabatic rapid passage (ARP), and the K atoms are transferred from the |9/2, 9/2i
state into the |9/2, ‚àí9/2i state via an RF-driven cascaded ARP.
The ‚ÄúFC‚Äù coil pair around the ‚Äúscience‚Äù chamber is then switched
on to produce a 550 G magnetic field and ODT evaporation is
performed inside the XODT by lowering the intensity of the ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù beam by a factor of 20. This further increases the PSD
of the atoms for the purpose of improving the efficiency of the
magneto-association. At the end of the ODT evaporation we have
4 √ó 104 87 Rb atoms and 7 √ó 104 40 K atoms at 500 nK in the XODT.
At this stage, the trapping frequencies are 2œÄ √ó {265, 265, 60} Hz
for Rb atoms and 2œÄ √ó {376, 376, 85} Hz for K atoms. The magnetic field is then adiabatically ramped down from 550 G to 544 G
across an inter-species Feshbach resonance centered at 546.62 G.
This results in the creation of ‚àº 6 √ó 103 weakly-bound, Feshbach
KRb molecules. To characterize the number and temperature of
these Feshbach molecules, the magnetic field ramp is reversed to
dissociate them back into free atoms, so that an absorption image
of either atomic species can be taken. The image for Rb atoms is
shown in Fig. 3(b).
The molecular population is then coherently transferred from
the Feshbach state, | f i, into the |mKI , mRb
I i = | ‚àí 4, 1/2i hyperfine
state of the lowest rovibronic state, |gi = |X 1 Œ£+ , v = 0, N = 0i, using a pair of STIRAP laser pulses at 970 nm and 690 nm, with

intermediate (see Fig. 3 (a)). During the transfer, the intensities of the two pulses, which are proportional to the squared
Rabi rates for the two transitions, are ramped according to the
‚ÄúForward‚Äù part of Fig. 3(d). To characterize the ground state
molecules using optical imaging, the STIRAP ramps are reversed
and the back-converted Feshbach molecules are imaged. Fig. 3(e)
shows the number of Feshbach molecules at various times during the STIRAP ramp sequence in Fig. 3(d). The integrated ion
spectrometer (to be described in section 3.3) also allows us to directly probe the ground state KRb molecules using ionization followed by TOF mass spectrometry (see TOF mass spectrum in Fig.
3(c)). The evolution of the KRb+ counts, which is proportional to
the number of ground state molecules, shows a pattern complimentary to that obtained from imaging Feshbach molecules (see
Fig. 3(e)). The reversible transfer of population between Feshbach and ground molecular states demonstrates the coherent
nature of STIRAP. In a typical experiment, we obtain ‚àº 5 √ó 103
ground state KRb molecules at 500 nK with a peak density of
1012 cm‚àí3 . They are confined in the XODT with trapping frequencies of 2œÄ √ó {300, 300, 68} Hz. The molecular cloud is ellipticallyshaped, with a characteristic size of 10 √ó 10 √ó 30 um. The one-way
STIRAP efficiency is ‚àº 90% for all experiments described in the

1‚Äì14 | 5

rest of the paper ‚àó .
For the purpose of studying the KRb + KRb reaction (Reaction
1), the remaining K and Rb atoms that did not form molecules are
pushed out of the XODT using 5 ms long resonant light pulses.
The amount of atoms that survive the pushout is measured with
ion TOF mass spectrometry to be less than 200 for each species.
For future studies of the K/Rb + KRb reaction (Reactions 2 and
3), we can leave a variable amount of atoms in the ODT by adjusting the intensity and duration of the atom push-out pulse.
The typical cycle time from the loading of the dual species MOT
to the production of ground state molecules is 50 s, with MOT
loading (6 s), RF evaporation (30 s), and ODT evaporation (5
s) accounting for the majority of the cycle time. This relatively
long time scale is typical for ultracold quantum gas experiments,
which share many of the same steps ‚Ä† .
3.3

Probing ultracold reactions: the ion mass and kinetic
energy spectrometer

As soon as the ultracold reactants are created in the XODT, chemical reactions proceed continuously through two-body collisions.
This is in contrast to molecular beam experiments, the traditional
platform for studying chemical dynamics, where in each iteration
of the experiment all the reactions occur over a narrow time window, defined by either an initializing laser pulse or the crossing
between two molecular beams. As the reaction progresses in the
trap, we probe it by ion mass and kinetic energy spectrometry.
Neutral species from the reaction are first photoionized by a UV
laser pulse, then accelerated by VMI ion optics, and finally detected by a multi-channel plate (MCP) detector. The MCP records
the TOFs and hit locations of the ions, from which mass and kinetic energy information can be respectively extracted. In the
subsections below, we discuss the design of key components of
the spectrometer.
3.3.1

Ionization source

The ultracold reactions we probe involve a variety of chemical
species with distinct photoionization characteristics (Fig. 4). To
efficiently ionize each species, a frequency tunable source is desired. TOF mass spectrometry requires a well-defined time-zero,
which demands a pulsed source. To fulfill the above two requirements, we use a frequency-doubled, broadly tunable dye
laser (LIOP-TEC/LiopStar-HQ) pumped by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser
(EdgeWave BX80) as our ionization source. The system has a
pulse duration of 7 ns, a spectral width of 0.06 cm‚àí1 , and a tuning range of 220 - 400 nm (after frequency-doubling by a BBO3
crystal). The wavelength of the laser is calibrated to within 0.02

‚àó The one-way efficiency is defined as the square root of the round-trip efficiency,
which is the percentage of Feshbach molecules recovered after the forward and reverse STIRAP sequence shown in Fig. 3(d). The STIRAP efficiency depends strongly
on the relative coherence between the two laser frequencies. An improvement in this
coherence resulted in an increase of the one-way efficiency from ‚àº 70%, as shown

cm‚àí1 using a laser wavelength meter.
The requirement for a pulsed source is somewhat at odds with
the continuous nature of our reactions. As the reaction progresses, both the intermediate complex and the products are continuously produced and then quickly ‚Äúlost‚Äù by either dissociation
or escaping from the detection region. Since the cycle time of
our experiment is long and the particle number low, it is important to maximize the total number of products/intermediates that
can be ionized in each experimental cycle in order to achieve
a reasonable data collection rate. This number scales linearly
as both the pulse energy and the repetition rate, i.e. the timeaveraged power, of the ionization source. Very high pulse energies can result in undesirable effects such as the saturation of
ionization probability, space-charge effects, and two-photon processes. Therefore, an ionization source with a high repetition rate
and a moderate pulse energy is desired. An upper limit on the
repetition rate is imposed by the range of TOFs expected for the
ions of interest, which in our case can be as long as 130 ¬µs. we
therefore chose an ionization laser with a tunable repetition rate
of up to 10 kHz and a pulse energy of 10 - 100 ¬µJ.
3.3.2

Photoionization scheme

Below we outline the strategy for ionizing the reactants, the intermediates , and the products, respectively. The ground state energies of all relevant species and their first-ionized counterparts
are given in Fig. 4.
All reactants (K, Rb, and KRb) can be ionized by 285 nm or
shorter wavelengths. We shape the ionization laser into a Gaussian beam and center it around the reactant cloud. Due to the
high density of reactants, the UV pulse energy must be kept low
to ensure that no more than one ion is generated per pulse to
prevent ion count saturation and space-charge effects.
When ionizing products (K, K2 , and Rb2 ), we must consider the
fact that some of them have higher IP compared to the reactants,
and that the same photons that ionize them can ionize and deplete the reactants, leading to a reduction in the total number of
products generated and detected per cycle. To circumvent this issue, we shape the ionization beam into a hollow-bottle beam with
a ring profile around the reactant cloud (Fig. 5(b)). The products
will have enough kinetic energy to escape the shallow trapping
potential (‚àº 10¬µK ) of the ODT and reach the ionization beam.
Reactants, on the other hand, are left mostly in the dark.
The optical setup we use to create the hollow-bottle beam 75 is
shown in Fig. 5. The combination of two lenses and an axicon
(L1, L2, and AX in Fig.5) transforms the input Gaussian beam first
into a Bessel beam, and finally into a hollow-bottle beam. The focal plane of the bottle beam, where the ring becomes the sharpest
(0.45 mm diameter, 5.4 ¬µm Gaussian ring width), intercepts the
reactant cloud (Fig. 5(b)). The bottle closes up at 6.4 mm and
16.5 mm away from either side of its focus. We generate two such
beams and cross them at a 40‚ó¶ angle around the reactant cloud
(Fig. 5(a)). We measure a 500:1 contrast ratio between the intensities at (the peak of) the ring and the center of the beam. At
the UV pulse energy and repetition rate we typically use to ionize
the products, we observe an acceptable amount of depletion of
the reactants (see section 4).

Intermediates (K2 Rb‚àó , KRb‚àó2 , and K2 Rb‚àó2 ) are formed by the collision between a pair of reactants and are therefore present inside the ODT. To ionize them we use a Gaussian beam profile
similar to that used to ionize reactants. Fortunately, all the intermediates have lower IP than the lowest of the reactants (KRb,
IP = 3.23 √ó 104 cm‚àí1 ), and therefore the ionization of the intermediates does not result in significant depletion of the reactants
(see section 4).

that is related to KE according to

VMI ion optics

Kinetic energy spectrometry can be achieved through ion imaging, a workhorse technique behind many studies of gas-phase
chemical dynamics 39 . In an experiment, ions of a given species
and kinetic energy KE are distributed on a Newton sphere. This
sphere expands as the ion packet, accelerated by an electric field,
flies towards the detector along the TOF axis. By the time the

where A is a proportionality constant that depends on the distance of flight, the mass of the ion, and details of the acceleration
E-field. The Newton is projected onto the detector to form a 2D
image, from which its radius R can be extracted through either
mathematical reconstruction or time-slicing methods 39 . Timeslicing is enabled in our experiment by the delay-line MCP‚Äôs ability to record both the time-of-flight and the position of each ion
hit. This allows a narrow time slice in the middle of the Newton sphere, typically ‚àº 10% of the total ion packet duration, to be
selected and analyzed for R.
Electric field plates are typically employed to apply the acceleration E-field to the ions. While a simple two-plate design could
provide mapping between an ion‚Äôs velocity and position on the
detector, it also inevitably maps its initial location in the ionization volume onto the position on the detector. The kinetic energy resolution of such a design is ultimately limited by the initial
spatial extent of the ion distribution. This issue can be circumvented by employing VMI ion optics, which consists of multiple
field plates with carefully designed geometries and voltages. Such
a configuration creates an E-field in which a one-to-one mapping
between the velocity of the ions and their position on the detector
is achieved.
Our VMI setup design is guided by Ref. 62 and 76 . The CAD
drawing of the VMI ion optics is shown in Fig 6(a). The electric
field plate stack consists of five gold-plated copper plates (labeled
from left to right as R, 1,2,3,4,and 5) supported by four alumina
rods and spaced from each other by alumina spacers. The reactant cloud is placed at the center between the repeller (R) and
extractor (1) plates. To determine the optimal geometries and
voltages of the five plates, we use SIMION to simulate VMI performance. The optimization parameters include the aperture size
of each plate, the distances between neighboring plates, and the
voltages of the electrodes. We imported our 3D mechanical model
into SIMION (v8.1) to perform an accurate simulation (Fig. 6(c)).
The final design parameters are summarized in Tab. 1. The voltage applied to each plate is reported as a percentage of the repeller voltage VR . An appropriate VR must be chosen for each
chemical reaction we study to achieve a balance between kinetic
energy resolution and detection range, given the finite size of the

MCP and the apertures along the TOF axis. Two primary settings
are used in our experiments. In the ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù (‚Äúhigh energy‚Äù)
setting, VR is set to be around 100 V (1000 V), which gives an
energy range of ‚àº 0 ‚àí 150cm‚àí1 (‚àº 0 ‚àí 2500cm‚àí1 ) and is appropriate for studying the product kinetic energy distribution of the
KRb + KRb (K + KRb) reaction for both ground and low-lying
rovibrationally excitedp
reactants. The proportionality constant A
in Eq. 4 is 16.44mm/ cm‚àí1 /V from simulation. Experimental
calibration of A is discussed in section 5. Imperfections in the real
experimental setup limits the energy resolution of VMI (the ability to distinguish adjacent VMI rings). For ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù setting,
we find the minimum resolvable energy difference to be 0.1 cm‚àí1
around 0 cm‚àí1 , 2 cm‚àí1 around 10 cm‚àí1 , and 6 cm‚àí1 around 100
cm‚àí1 . The resolution for the ‚Äúhigh energy‚Äù setting is overall ‚àº 3.3
times lower.
3.3.4

Detector

For detecting the ions we use a delay-line MCP (Roentdek DLD80)
(Fig. 2(e), Fig. 6(b)). The MCP has an active diameter of 80 mm,
a spatial resolution of 0.08 mm, and a temporal resolution of 1 ns.
Details of the detector performance can be found in Ref. 77 . The
VMI voltages that we typically use (100 - 1000 V) is insufficient
to accelerate the ions to high enough kinetic energies needed for
high MCP detection efficiency. To improve the efficiency, we place
a grounded stainless-steel mesh 3 mm before the MCP stack front
surface and bias it to -3.8 kV to create an extra stage of acceleration. The resulting detection efficiency, after accounting for the
mesh transmission (75%), the MCP open-area-ratio (60%), and
the mass-dependent intrinsic MCP efficiency (calculated based on
an empirical formula developed in 78 ), is 0.394 (0.282) for the
lightest (heaviest) ion, K+ (K2 Rb+
2 ), in our experiment.

4 Detecting the products and the intermediate
complex of the KRb + KRb reaction
We used ion mass spectrometry to directly probe for the products
and the intermediate complex of the ultracold KRb + KRb reaction (reaction 1). For these experiments, ‚àº 5000 KRb molecules

were prepared in the rovibronic ground state. As the sample reacts, the products (intermediate complex) were ionized using a
crossed hollow-bottle (Gaussian) UV beam profile with 305 (335)
nm wavelength, 60 (14) ¬µJ average pulse energy, and 3 (7) kHz
repitition rate. Ion signals were accumulated for 800 (1200) experimental cycles to result in the TOF mass spectra shown in Fig.
7(a) (Fig. 7(b)). Each ‚Äúsignal‚Äù spectrum (gray) is accompanied
by a ‚Äúbackground‚Äù spectrum (cyan), recorded without atoms and
molecules in ODT, to distinguish mass peaks that correspond to
species of interest from noise peaks. The detection of the products
and intermediate complex were first presented in Ref. 38 , where
ionization was carried out using different wavelengths. In the
305 (335) nm case, single-photon (two-photon) ionization of the
reactant KRb molecules results in a 30% (20%) depletion of their
population over the course of the reaction, and a strong KRb+
(m/z = 127) ion signal in the spectrum.
From the 305 nm mass spectrum, we identify mass peaks that
+
correspond to K+
2 (m/z = 80) and Rb2 (m/z = 174), resulting from
single-photon ionization of the reaction products K2 and Rb2 . The
residual light intensity at the center of the crossed hollow beams
results in a small but observable amount of dissociative ionization
of species present inside the XODT. In particular, the pathway

sated by the high density of KRb and Rb2 present inside the XODT
to yield observable signals. Two-photon dissociation plus ionization of KRb results in the K+ and Rb+ signals. We take advantage
of this process for the calibration described in section 5.

5 Calibration of the kinetic energy spectrometer
Calibrating the kinetic energy spectrometer means experimentally
determining the relationship between the radii of ion Newton
spheres and their associated kinetic energies. This requires the
generation of ions with sufficient and well-known kinetic energies, which is a challenge for ultracold systems where particles
move with negligible kinetic energies. Photodissociation (PD) of
diatomic molecules, which imparts a well-defined amount of kinetic energy into the recoiling photofragments, provides a suitable solution to this challenge. 62 We used the one-color, twophoton dissociation plus ionization process shown schematically
in Fig. 8 (a). The first photon dissociates the ground state KRb
molecules into K and Rb photofragments, and the second photon ionizes the optically excited fragment. Ion images were acquired at different photon energies. For each ion image, ‚àº 5000
KRb molecules in their rovibrational ground state were exposed to
5000 UV laser pulses over 1 s for 500 - 1500 experimental cycles.

The use of ultracold precursors in a single quantum level for PD
ensures the production of photofragments with sharply-defined
kinetic energies, a feature especially beneficial to calibration at
low kinetic energies. The average number of ions generated per
UV pulse is kept much less than one to ensure the resulting ion
images not broadened by space-charge. Separate calibrations are
carried out for the ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh energy‚Äù repeller voltage (VR ) settings.
For ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù calibration, VR is set to 100.2 V. We photodissociated KRb into K (5P) and Rb (5S) and ionized K (5P) to pro-

where EŒ≥ is the photon energy of the laser (calibrated to within
0.02 cm‚àí1 ), Eth is the atomic threshold energy of the corresponding PD channel, and D0 is the dissociation energy of the rovibronic
ground state KRb molecule (see Tab 2). The proportionality constant accounts for the fraction of the total PD kinetic energy release partitioned into the K photofragment. In the case of Fig.
8 (b), the KE of ions belonging to the inner and outer Newton
spheres are calculated to be 11.67 and 24.52 cm‚àí1 , respectively.
Fig. 9(a) shows a summary of R and KE obtained at different
wavelengths. Contributions from the two different PD channels
are color-coded. Time-slice analysis was used to extract R for all
data points except for the two with the lowest KE, where the
ion TOF distribution are not sufficiently broad to time-slice. In

‚Ä° As demonstrated in Ref. 20 , maintaining the quantization to the fermionic KRb
molecules is essential to keeping them in a single quantum state, such that they
undergo p-wave collision and the sample enjoys a relatively long lifetime. A longerlived sample allows us to collect more ions towards the calibration per experimental
cycle.
¬ß This formula results from a quasiclassical model describing the angular distribution
of fragments produced by the photodissociation of molecules prepared in spherically
symmetric states 80 , e.g. KRb prepared in the rovibrational ground state. Here b is
a constant, Œ≤ is the anisotropy parameter that varies from +2 (‚Äúparallel‚Äù transition)
to -1 (‚Äúperpendicular‚Äù transition), Œ∏ is the angle in the plane of the image, and P2 is
the second order Legendre polynomial.

rings to ions dissociated from the K (52 P3/2 ) + Rb (52 S1/2 ) and
the K (52 P1/2 ) + Rb (52 S1/2 ) channels, respectively. We note that
the rings are broadened due to a 0.253 cm‚àí1 of recoil energy imparted to the K+ ions by the ionizing UV photon. To determine the
radii of the two underlying Newton spheres, we select ions from
the central 4 ns time-slice of a 40 ns distribution along the TOF
axis (Fig. 8 (c)). The time-slice is then angle-integrated to obtain
the radial intensity distribution (Fig. 8 (d)). Gaussian fits are
applied to the radial distribution to extract the radii R, which are
5.18 ¬± 0.03 mm and 7.50 ¬± 0.05 mm for the inner and outer Newton spheres respectively. The anistoropy of each Newton sphere
is analyzed by examining the angular intensity distribution (Fig.
8 (e)) of the corresponding ring in the time-slice. The distributions are fitted to the function b(1 + Œ≤ P2 (cos Œ∏ )) ¬ß . The resulting
anisotropy parameter Œ≤ is 1.89 ¬± 0.05 (‚âà 2) for the inner ring, indicating that the PD transition dipole moment is mostly parallel
to the molecular axis. For the outer ring, Œ≤ = 1.00 ¬± 0.08, indicating a mix of parallel of perpendicular characters in the PD transition. Detailed understanding of the observed photofragment
anisotropy in Fig. 8 is a subject for future study.
The kinetic energy of ions associated with each Newton sphere

these two cases, inverse Abel analysis 81 using the PyAbel software package 82 was employed. The data set is fitted to the function R2 = A2 KE/VR to determine the calibration constant A.
For ‚Äúhigh energy‚Äù calibration, VR is set to 992 V. We photodissociated KRb into K 4S + Rb 6P and ionized Rb 6P to produce
Rb+ ions with KE in the 0 - 450 cm‚àí1 range (Fig. 8 (a)) by
varying the UV laser wavelength (photon energy) between 358
nm (27933 cm‚àí1 ) and 340 nm (29412 cm‚àí1 ). The magnetic
field is 30G at the KRb cloud location. The ion image acquired
at 346 nm and its time-slice are shown in Fig. 8 (f) and (g). R
is determined through inverse Abel analysis for the lowest KE
data point and through time-slice analysis for all others. The data
analysis follows the same procedures as for the ‚Äúlow energy‚Äù case
and the results are shown in Fig. 9 (b). All identified Newton
spheres are assigned to the K (4S1/2 ) + Rb (6P1/2 ) PD channel.
Contributions from the K (4S1/2 ) + Rb (6P3/2 ) channel, which is
77.51 cm‚àí1 higher in energy (see Tab. 2), were not identified
from any of the ion images. The calibration

6 Outlook
In conclusion, we present the ‚Äúultracold chemistry machine‚Äù and
demonstrate its capability to produce ultracold, quantum statespecific reactants, detect all species involved the ensuing reactions, and measure the kinetic energy distribution of particles.
The direct detection of both the products and the transient intermediate of the KRb + KRb reaction 38 opens the door to further
investigations of the reaction dynamics.
With the calibrated ion kinetic energy spectrometer, we aim
to study the product state distribution of the KRb + KRb reaction. Using energy conservation, which establishes a unique
correspondence between the internal and translational energies
of the products, the internal state distribution can be extracted
from the velocity-map ion image of the products. In addition,
resonantly-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) can also
provide product quantum state information. Combined use of
REMPI and VMI together will provide the most complete picture
of the state distributions of K2 and Rb2 .
The transient intermediate complex and its dynamics is another
subject of immediate interest for further investigation. In the
time-domain, directly measuring the lifetime of the K2 Rb‚àó2 complex will provide insights into the role of long-lived complexes
in bialkali quantum gases, a subject of ongoing theoretical debate 44,83 and experimental investigation 84,85 . In the frequencydomain, the energy and geometric structures of the complex can
be studied through spectroscopy. It may be possible to directly
influence the complex using external fields and gain control over
the rate or outcome of the reaction.
Beyond studying the reactions between rovibronic ground state
molecules, molecule formation via STIRAP also allows reactants
in rovibrationally excited states to be prepared. Under ultracold
conditions, even small changes in the degree of internal excitation can significantly impact the reaction dynamics, which can
manifest in changes of the complex lifetime and the product distribution. Studying reactions starting from different initial states
can potentially provide a systematic picture on how the dynamics
of complex-forming reactions depend on the density of states and
the number of open channels.
Bringing together tools from AMO phyiscs and physical chemistry allows for the exploration of the largely uncharted territory
that is ultracold reaction dynamics, with many exciting possibilities and surprises ahead.
