Abstract
Channel estimation for the downlink of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems
is well known to generate a large overhead as the amount of training generally scales with the number
of transmit antennas in a MIMO system. In this paper, we consider the solution of extrapolating the
channel frequency response from uplink pilot estimates to the downlink frequency band. This drastically
reduces the downlink pilot overhead and completely removes the need for a feedback from the users.
The price to pay is a degradation in the quality of the channel estimates, which reduces the downlink
spectral efficiency. We first show that conventional estimators fail to achieve reasonable accuracy. We
propose instead to use high-resolution channel estimation. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) of the mean squared error (MSE) of the extrapolated channel. Furthermore, a relationship
between the imperfect channel state information (CSI) and the downlink user performance is derived.
The extrapolation-based FDD massive MIMO performance is validated through numerical simulations
and compared to a corresponding time division duplex (TDD) system. Considered figures of merit for
extrapolation performance include channel MSE, beamforming efficiency, extrapolation range, spectral
efficiency and uncoded symbol error rate. Our main conclusion is that channel extrapolation is a viable
solution for FDD massive MIMO systems.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The deployment of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications systems
strongly relies on the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station
(BS) [2]. Massive MIMO systems are typically characterized by a much larger number of
antennas at the BS than the sum of the antennas at the user equipments (UEs). This implies that
channel estimation is much less costly in the uplink (UL) than in the downlink (DL) [3]. In time
division duplex (TDD) systems, the BS can efficiently perform DL channel estimation from UL
pilot transmission from the UEs (see Fig. 1), since channel reciprocity holds as long as UL and
DL transmission occurs within a coherence time of the channel, and within the same frequency
band. However, in a frequency division duplex (FDD) scenario, reciprocity cannot be exploited
as different bands, usually separated by more than a coherence bandwidth, are used in UL and
DL. On the other hand, estimation of the channel by DL pilot transmission and feedback might
result in a large overhead.
A variety of methods have been proposed to solve this dilemma, such as channel correlations
in the spatial domain reflected in second-order statistics [4], [5], compression of the feedback
[6], combinations thereof [7], compression of the feedback based on deep learning [8], 3-D
beamforming based on channel statistics [9], or compressed sensing methods [10], each of which
involves some feedback from the users. One of the most promising methods is channel extrapolation from the UL to the DL band as it completely removes the overhead. The extrapolation
range of conventional least squares (LS) and linear minimum mean squared (LMMSE) is very

3

limited - typically to the order of one coherence bandwidth, as will be further shown in this
work. To overcome this limit, [11] suggested estimation of the multipath components (MPCs)
via high-resolution parameter estimation (HRPE). Based on the structure of the channel and the
extracted MPCs, extrapolation over wide frequency range can be achieved. However, the paper
only considered the single-input-single-output (SISO) case, which resulted in a poor extrapolation
performance. Ref. [12] extends the setup to the MIMO case and the extrapolation to the spatial
domain. Multiple measurements show that a frequency extrapolation range larger than 5 times
the coherence bandwidth can be reached. Ref. [13] presents the so-called R2-F2 system to extract
path parameters and extrapolate the channel in frequency. The paper shows how to integrate the
system into LTE cellular networks and uses experimental measurements for validation. The study
restricted the frequency spacing between UL and DL band to be only 20-30 MHz and did not
study the mean squared error (MSE) of the extrapolated channel. Ref. [14] compares different
extrapolation algorithms. This study shows that super-resolution can outperform compressed
sensing methods for frequency channel extrapolation. In [15], information about user angles is
extracted from UL pilots using 2D unitary ESPRIT, a subspace-based HRPE method [16]. Then,
directional training is performed in the DL. Ref. [17] similarly proposes an angle-of-departure
(AoD) adaptive subspace codebook to reduce channel feedback overhead. In [18], a hybrid
statistical-instantaneous feedback mechanism where the users are separated into two classes of
feedback design based on their channel covariance. Ref. [19] proposes to train a neural network
to perform the channel extrapolation in frequency. This approach does not require the acquisition
of the antenna array patterns through calibration but requires a large training dataset. Ref. [20]
proposes to acquire DL CSI through UL pilots in combination with a limited feedback from DL
pilots. In [21], channel extrapolation performance is experimentally evaluated, in terms of MSE
of the extrapolated channel and beamforming efficiency.
Channel extrapolation in frequency also presents formal similarities to extrapolation in time.
In contrast to frequency-domain extrapolation, channel prediction in time has been extensively
investigated in the literature. A comprehensive review can be found in [22]. In [23], the authors
proposed performance bounds for prediction in time of MIMO channels. They later extended
their study to MIMO-OFDM channel estimation with interpolation and extrapolation being done
both in time and frequency [24]. It is observed that MIMO provides much longer prediction
lengths in time and frequency than for SISO systems.
To provide understanding of low-overhead FDD massive MIMO systems, this paper investi-

4

gates the theoretical performance of channel extrapolation in frequency. The main originality of
our paper is that it provides an in-depth theoretical study of the system performance as opposed
to previous approaches, that were mostly validated through simulations and/or experiments.
More specifically, we highlight the advantages of HRPE in terms of channel extrapolation as
compared to conventional LS and LMMSE channel estimation. The channel MSE of both types
of estimators is analytically studied. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the
MSE, using a similar methodology as in [24]. The proposed CRLB differs from [24] by taking
into account elevation angles, the frequency dependence of the pattern, and the influence of the
training symbols. Furthermore, we propose a simplified CRLB, obtained under the assumption of
well separated paths and giving more physical intuition about the frequency extrapolation range
that can be expected in practice. The simplified CRLB shows that the MSE of the extrapolated
channel frequency response is inversely proportional to the number of receive antennas while
the extrapolation performance penalty scales with the square of the ratio of the frequency
offset from the carrier frequency and the training bandwidth. This paper furthermore studies
analytically the downlink user performance under imperfect CSI, with emphasis on the induced
beamforming power loss. Finally, extensive numerical evaluations validate the extrapolationbased FDD performance and carefully compares it to a corresponding TDD system. Various
performance metrics are included such as channel MSE, beamforming efficiency, extrapolation
range, spectral efficiency and uncoded symbol error rate.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the channel model used in
this work. Section III introduces the LS, the LMMSE and the high-resolution SAGE estimator.
Section IV studies the theoretical performance of the previously introduced estimation algorithms.
Section V numerically validates the performance of an extrapolation-based FDD massive MIMO
system using a standardized 3GPP channel model. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and
appendixes contain the mathematical proof of previous sections.

II. C HANNEL M ODEL
We consider a FDD massive MIMO scenario where each user has a single-antenna and transmits an UL training sequence that is orthogonal to those of the other users. Thus, the estimations
for different users become independent and in particular, the extrapolation in frequency of the
SIMO channel of each user can be treated independently. For the sake of clarity and without
loss of generality, we only consider one user in the following. We denote by M the number of
BS antennas.
We consider the transmission of a single orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
multicarrier symbol. Since pilot symbols are orthogonal to data symbols, we only consider the
samples received at pilot subcarriers for clarity. As depicted in Fig. 2, the BS obtains a total of K
pilot symbols scattered across frequency. The k-th transmitted pilot symbol is denoted by s(fk )
with fk being the baseband frequency of the pilot subcarrier. All pilot subcarriers are transmitted
inside the uplink transmission band of width B, i.e., fk ‚àà [‚àíB/2, B/2], k = 0, ..., K ‚àí 1. As
common, we assume that the channel is time-invariant between the transmission of the uplink
pilots and the use of the (extrapolated) CSI, e.g., for downlink beamforming. In other words,
the mobility of the environment should be low enough to ensure that the coherence time of the
channel is larger than this delay. Note that this quasi-static assumption is better fulfilled than
in most of the FDD works in the literature involving a feedback from the user. Indeed, these
works assume that the channel remains time-invariant during the transmission of downlink pilots,
feedback from the users and finally the use of the obtained CSI for downlink beamforming. The
OFDM demodulated pilot symbol at antenna m and frequency fk can be expressed as
rm (fk ) = hm (fk )s(fk ) + wm (fk ),

i.e., E (wm (fk )wm

Furthermore, we assume that the propagation channel is composed of L specular paths, where
each path is completely characterized by its deterministic parameters: complex gain Œ±l = <(Œ±l )+
Ôöæ=(Œ±l ), delay œÑl , azimuth angle œÜl and elevation angle Œ∏l , as depicted in Fig. 3. All antennas are
assumed to be vertically polarized. Under these assumptions, the channel frequency response
hm (f ) can be expressed as
hm (f ) ,

(2)

where am (œÜ, Œ∏, f ) denotes the pattern of antenna m evaluated in the direction (œÜ, Œ∏) and at
frequency f . Note that the frequency dependence of the array pattern cannot generally be
omitted, depending on the size of the band B and the targeted extrapolation frequency range.
More specifically, the frequency selectivity of am (œÜ, Œ∏, f ) comes from two contributions: (i) the
frequency dependence of each individual antenna pattern and (ii) the frequency dependent phase
shift across the antenna array elements (beam squinting). This dependence is often neglected in
the literature when the ratio of the dimension of the array to the speed of light is much smaller
than the inverse of the bandwidth of the signal.
Furthermore, a number of straightforward generalizations of the model in (2) can be made:
(i) V and H polarizations can be taken into account by representing the path amplitudes as 2 √ó 1
vectors and the array patterns as 2√ó2 polarimetric matrices. (ii) multiple antenna elements at the
UEs can also be taken into account by considering their array pattern and angles of departures;

7

(iii) scatterers in the nearfield can be described by replacing the plane wave model of each path
by a spherical wave model, where the wavefront curvature of each path is now an additional
parameter of the model. However, for ease of exposition, we use the simplified model of (1) in
the remainder of this paper.
We finally note that a further requirement for using uplink CSI for downlink beamforming
is reciprocity calibration [25]‚Äì[27], since upconverters and downconverters might have different
transfer functions that have to be compensated for by suitable calibration. Since reciprocity
calibration affects FDD and TDD systems in the same manner, we disregard it in the following
derivations and simulations, i.e., we assume that it is perfect.
III. C HANNEL E STIMATION AND E XTRAPOLATION
In this section, we first review conventional low-resolution channel estimators such as LS and
LMMSE. We then explain the general concept of high-resolution channel estimation and we detail
the principle of the SAGE algorithm. If the frequency of interest f of the channel estimate hÃÇm (f )
is inside the training band f ‚àà [‚àíB/2, B/2], we refer to the estimation process as interpolation.
Otherwise, if f ‚àà
/ [‚àíB/2, B/2], we refer to it as extrapolation and f is also referred to as the
extrapolation range. One can note that the interpolation performance corresponds to the channel
estimation performance of a downlink TDD performance since uplink and downlink bands are
shared in TDD mode.
A. Conventional Low-Resolution Estimation
As depicted in Fig. 2, LS estimators perform a simple per-antenna estimation at each pilot
subcarrier as
hÃÇLS,m (fk ) =

wm (fk )
rm (fk )
= hm (fk ) +
,
s(fk )
s(fk )

(3)

for k = 0, ..., K ‚àí 1. Based on the K channel estimates obtained at each pilot subcarrier, a
linear method is generally used to obtain the channel at non-pilot subcarriers. We here propose
to use a LMMSE estimator [28]. Denoting the vector containing the LS estimates by hÃÇLS,m ,
(hÃÇLS,m (f0 ), . . . , hÃÇLS,m (fK‚àí1 ))T , the LMMSE estimate at frequency f is given by
hÃÇLMMSE,m (f ) = pH
m (f )hÃÇLS,m ,

(4)

where the vector of coefficient pH
m (f ) is obtained by minimizing the MSE of the estimate.
Assuming that the complex channel hm (fk ) has a zero mean, this gives

is the autocorrelation function of the channel frequency response. An implementation challenge
of the LMMSE estimator is the computation of Ch,m (f, f 0 ). This function depends on the
joint distribution of the path parameters. In the following, we approximate the computation
of Ch,m (f, f 0 ) by assuming that, as in [28], the paths gains and delays are i.i.d. We also
assume a frequency independent pattern1 am (œÜ, Œ∏, f ) = am (œÜ, Œ∏) and isotropic array pattern
|am (œÜ, Œ∏)|2 = 1. Furthermore, the delay of each path œÑl has a uniform distribution in [0, œÑmax ]
while the complex path gain Œ±l has a uniform power across delay. This gives

where ‚àÜf = f ‚àí f 0 and Ph = Ch,m (0) is the averaged channel power. The LMMSE estimator
performs relatively well in-band as long as the pilot spacing is smaller than 1/œÑmax , in accordance
with the Nyquist sampling theorem. However, its extrapolation performance degrades quickly
out of the training band, as will be analytically studied in Section IV. An intuitive way to see
this is to simply notice that the autocorrelation function Ch,m (‚àÜf ) decays in 1/(‚àÜf œÑmax ). This
implies that the extrapolation performance can only be satisfactory for extrapolation range f

This assumption is not very restrictive here given that, for typical values of B, the array can be considered frequency

spaced about 1/œÑmax away from the training band, i.e., f ‚àà [‚àí B2 ‚àí œÑmax

delay spread of œÑmax = 2.5 ¬µs, we have

1
œÑmax

= 400 kHz, which is much too low to deploy a

typical FDD massive MIMO system.
Note that, to compute the expectation E[.], we used the long term statistics of the path
parameters. Following the same idea, the LMMSE estimator presented here did not combine the
LS samples from different antennas and hence did not leverage spatial correlation to improve
the performance. This is justified for the case that the angular spread is sufficiently large (for
a given antenna spacing) such that the correlation between antennas is close to zero, i.e.,
E (hm (f )hm0 (f )‚àó ) ‚âà 0 if m 6= m0 ; e.g., if the antenna spacing is half a wavelength and the
angular distribution of the scatterers is uniform [29]. This implies that combining the LS estimates
from different antennas would not provide any significant gain.
On the other hand, an improved LMMSE estimator implementation would require to estimate
the second-order statistics of the channel or ‚Äúinstantaneous‚Äù distribution of the path parameters.
Under typical propagation conditions, paths delays and angles are clustered and thus far from
being uniformly distributed. This implies that the frequency-space correlation function can be
first estimated and then leveraged to significantly improve the LMMSE performance [4], [5].
However, this gain is properly taking into account by the high-resolution estimator proposed in
the following.
B. High-Resolution Estimation
The poor extrapolation performance of the LMMSE estimator can be intuitively explained by
the fact that the extrapolated channel does not exhibit a linear dependence on the in-band channel
frequency response. On the other hand, high-resolution channel estimation allows to alleviate
these limitations. As depicted in Fig. 4, instead of estimating the composite channel function
hm (f ), the HRPE approach directly estimates the parameters of each path. Taking advantage of
the underlying (non-linear) physical dependence of the channel on its parameters can prove very
useful to improve the extrapolation performance.
If we denote by œÑÃÇl , œÜÃÇl , Œ∏ÃÇl and Œ±ÃÇl the high-resolution estimates of œÑl , œÜl , Œ∏l and Œ±l respectively,
the high-resolution (HR) estimate of the extrapolated channel reads as

Extrapolation

High-resolution parameter extraction

Fig. 4. Extrapolation-based FDD system: channel in the downlink band is extrapolated from pilots received in the uplink band,
relying on high-resolution parameter extraction. CSI: channel state information.

Of course, intuitive reasoning tells us that the extrapolated channel will suffer from the estimation
errors on the path parameters. Indeed, the finite bandwidth and aperture of the array directly
induce a finite resolution in delay and angle, which leads to inaccuracy in the estimation of
the delay and angle parameters. Moreover, the error on hÃÇHR,m (f ) becomes especially large as
the extrapolation range becomes large. Indeed, one can note that the delay estimates œÑÃÇl are
multiplied by f so that the error increases as f increases. The impact of inaccurate parameter
estimation will be carefully studied in Section IV-B. We also assume here that the parameters
of the MPCs are independent of frequency. In other words, the channel is assumed to remain
stationary on a frequency band including both uplink and downlink FDD disjoint bands. This
is well fulfilled in most practical situations [30], since these parameters remain constant over a
bandwidth corresponding to about 10% of the carrier frequency. For sub-6 GHz systems, this
assumption is generally satisfied so that channel extrapolation could be used. Indeed, the LTE
duplex spacing between uplink and downlink bands is: 10 to 70 MHz in the 700-900 MHz band
and 45 to 190 MHz in the 1400-1700 MHz band. An exception are the Advanced Wireless
Services (AWS) bands of LTE, which have up to 400 MHz spacing at 1700-2100 MHz carrier
frequency.
To extract the path parameters œÑÃÇl , œÜÃÇl , Œ∏ÃÇl and Œ±ÃÇl , we propose to use the SAGE algorithm
originally described in [31] and widely adopted in the channel propagation community. We

11

extended the algorithm to extract elevation angles and take into account the frequency dependence
of the array. One should note that the main contribution of this paper is not to propose a novel
efficient algorithm for high-resolution channel estimation but rather to show that the general
performance bounds derived in the next section can be approached by conventional algorithms
with reasonable complexity, such as the SAGE algorithm. Other HRPE algorithms could also
be applied and may provide different results.
In brief, the algorithm aims at maximizing the likelihood of the received samples at pilot
subcarriers as a function of the path parameters. Let us define œà = (œà T1 , . . . , œà TL )T ‚àà R5L√ó1 and

œà l = (œÑl , œÜl , Œ∏l , <(Œ±l ), =(Œ±l ))T ‚àà R5√ó1 as the vectors containing all real path parameters and

the real parameters of each path respectively. The vectors œàÃÇ and œàÃÇ l respectively denote their
estimate. The optimization problem of maximizing the likelihood can be reformulated as

The problem is not easy to solve due to its high-dimensionality (5L) and the highly nonlinear dependence on the path parameters. The SAGE algorithm provides an efficient suboptimal
solution to the problem relying on an iterative approach. At each iteration, only the parameters
corresponding to one path, e.g., œà l , are optimized while other path parameters keep their
past value. This reduces the search dimensions from 5L dimensions to 5 dimensions at each
iteration. Furthermore, inside each iteration, the 5-dimensional search is simplified into five onedimensional searches optimizing each parameter one at a time using a line search. The algorithm
iterates until convergence or if a maximal number of iterations is achieved. The initial estimates
of each path are obtained by successive ordered cancellation.
IV. P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS
In this section, we start by studying the performance of the previously detailed algorithms in
terms of the MSE of the estimated channel frequency response and the related error correlation
matrix. In the last part of this section, we study the relationship between the MSE and the
downlink user performance. More specifically, we will derive the expression of the SNR at
the user side, taking into account the beamforming power loss induced by incorrect channel
estimates.
We define the MSE of an estimate hÃÇm (f ) of hm (f ) as
h
i
MSEm (f ) , E |hÃÇm (f ) ‚àí hm (f )|2 ,

(7)

12

where the expectation is taken over the noise realizations for a fixed channel realization hm (f )
and thus the underlying parameters œà. Similarly, the error correlation matrix of the channel
vector at frequency f is defined as

with MSEm (f ) = [E(f )]m,m , h(f ) = (h1 (f ), ..., hM (f ))T and hÃÇ(f ) = (hÃÇ1 (f ), ..., hÃÇM (f ))T .
A. Conventional Low-Resolution Estimation
To simplify the following expressions of the performance of the LS and LMMSE estimators,
we will assume equipowered pilot symbol, i.e., |s(fk )|2 = Es . This assumption is consistent
with, e.g., the Zhadoff-Chu training sequences in LTE and NR. Extension to the general case
P
2
is straightforward. The total training power is then ET = K‚àí1
k=0 |s(fk )| = KEs . Based on the
expression of the LS estimate in (3), the MSE expression at pilot subcarrier fk is obtained as

Moreover, the channel estimation errors at different antennas are uncorrelated given that noise

Defining hm , (hm (f0 ), . . . , hm (fK‚àí1 ))T and using the expression of the LMMSE estimate
in (4), the LMMSE performance for any frequency f in-band (interpolation) or out-of-band
(extrapolation) is

B. High-Resolution Estimation
The MSE performance of high-resolution estimation heavily depends on the choice of the
algorithm and the result is typically not in closed-form. To circumvent this limitation and make
our result more general and tractable, we will compute the CRLB of the channel estimate, which
is by definition a theoretical bound and is independent of the choice of the algorithm. In other
words, the goal of this paper is not to derive specific channel extrapolation algorithms and to
study their computational complexity, but we propose general theoretical performance bounds.
In the simulation section, we will show that SAGE performs close to the CRLB, implying that
the bound can be approached by conventional algorithms and hence is useful.
To derive this bound, we can first notice that h(f ) is a non-linear function of path parameters
œà, as explicitly detailed in (2). Using this fact, we can apply the CRLB formula for non-linear
transformation of parameters [32]. The bound tells us that for any unbiased estimator hÃÇ(f ) of
h(f ), we have
E(f ) < C(f ) , (G(f ))H I‚àí1
œà G(f ),

(9)

where matrices G(f ) and Iœà are the Jacobian and Fisher information matrices respectively,
whose forms are given in following subsections. The relationship E(f ) < C(f ) implies that the
matrix E(f ) ‚àí C(f ) is positive semidefinite, which directly implies that the MSE at antenna m
and frequency f can be bounded by the corresponding diagonal element

where gm,f is the m-th column of G(f ).

path parameters. Since the received samples rm (fk ) at each antenna and pilot subcarrier follow

dŒ±lI
Inserting these partial derivatives in (11) and for a specific array pattern am (œÜ, Œ∏, f ), the Fisher
information matrix in (12) can be easily constructed. In the following, we will make the assumption.
(As1): the Fisher information matrix Iœà is nonsingular.
In practice, a rank deficiency of Iœà could arise if several paths become close in delay and
angle, which would cause the determinant of Iœà to go to zero. To be more accurate, the definition
of ‚Äúclose distance in delay and angle‚Äù should always be measured relatively to the system Fourier
resolution. For instance, if the system occupies a 10 MHz bandwidth (B = 10 MHz), inducing
a resolution in delay of 1/B = 100 ns, two rays are said to be close in delay if their spacing
is much smaller than 100 ns. Depending on the underlying physical phenomenon inducing the
presence of dense multipath components, different solutions may be possible to address a rank
deficiency of Iœà .

15

If two rays, or more, are closely spaced in angle and delay and their delay separation is not
only smaller than 1/B but also much smaller than 1/f where f is the targeted extrapolation
range, then they can be replaced by a single ray whose complex gain is given by the sum
of the complex amplitudes of the correlated rays. As an example, if the targeted extrapolation
performance is f = 100 MHz, two rays with a spacing smaller than 1/f = 10 ns can be
combined without affecting the extrapolation performance significantly.
If the source of dense multipath components is related to wavefront curvature, a more advanced
channel model can be taken into account to address them [33], [34]. Indeed, our channel model
in (2) relies on a plane wave assumption. The presence of spherical waves would result in a
large number of plane waves in (2), inducing a potential ill-conditioning of Iœà .
If, finally, the dense multipath components are present due to a truly rich scattering environment, instead of trying to estimate a large number of possibly unreliable paths, a better solution
may be to consider them as random components. Rather than estimating their instantaneous
values, their statistics can be estimated and included in the likelihood formulation to improve
the conditioning of Iœà . This approach is used by, e.g., the RIMAX algorithm [35].
2) Jacobian matrix: Matrix G(f ) ‚àà C5L√óM is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation
defined as
G(f ) ,

‚àÇhm (f )
‚àÇhT (f )
, [G(f )]v,m =
.
‚àÇœà
‚àÇœàv

It can be partitioned into columns corresponding to each antenna element as G(f ) = (g1,f , ..., gM,f ).
Furthermore, each vector gm,f can be partitioned into different paths and path parameters as
gm,f = (gTm,f,œà1 , . . . , gTm,f,œàL )T
gm,f,œàl = (gm,f,œÑl , gm,f,œÜl , gm,f,Œ∏l , gm,f,Œ±Il , gm,f,Œ±Rl )T
gm,f,œÑl = (‚àíÔöæ2œÄf )Œ±l am (œÜl , Œ∏l , f )e‚àíÔöæ2œÄf œÑl
gm,f,œÜl = Œ±l aÃám,œÜ (œÜl , Œ∏l , f )e‚àíÔöæ2œÄf œÑl
gm,f,Œ∏l = Œ±l aÃám,Œ∏ (œÜl , Œ∏l , f )e‚àíÔöæ2œÄf œÑl
gm,f,Œ±Rl = am (œÜl , Œ∏l , f )e‚àíÔöæ2œÄf œÑl
gm,f,Œ±Il = Ôöæam (œÜl , Œ∏l , f )e‚àíÔöæ2œÄf œÑl .
3) Separated Rays: The CRLB of (10) is in closed-form, which allows to easily evaluate it
numerically. However, it requires the inversion of the Fisher information matrix and does not

16

provide much intuition on the extrapolation range that can be expected. To further characterize
and try to gain more insight, let us introduce the set of assumptions (As2) ‚àí (As4).
(As2): the array pattern is non frequency selective, i.e., am (œÜ, Œ∏, f ) = am (œÜ, Œ∏).
This assumption does not generally depend on the channel but rather on the system parameters such as type of BS antennas, extrapolation range and carrier frequency. The assumption
particularly makes sense if the antenna patterns are flat in the considered band and if the ratio
of the dimension of the array to the speed of light is much smaller than that the inverse of the
extrapolation range.
In the remaining part of this section, we assume that (As2) holds, and we drop the frequency
dependence of the array. We define the following vectors in order to introduce assumptions

(As3): separation of the L specular rays in delay, azimuth angle and/or elevation angle. We
assume that, for each pair of rays l, l0 (l 6= l0 ), at least one of the following two relationships is
verified:
(1) Separation in delay:
H
H
sH
l sl0 = sÃál sÃál0 = sÃál sl0 = 0.

(13)

(2) Separation in azimuth and/or elevation angle:

H

aÃáH
l,Œ∏ al0 = aÃál,œÜ al0 = aÃál,œÜ aÃál0 ,Œ∏ = 0.

The assumption (As3) is a strong assumption, whose accuracy will typically depend on
different parameters. The specular paths will generally become relatively more separated in
delay as the bandwidth of s(f ) increases, inducing higher resolution in delay. Similarly, the
resolution and hence the separation in azimuth and elevation will be improved as the number

17

of antenna elements M is increased. More generally, for a given channel, the validity of (As3)
will depend on the training signal s(fk ), on the array pattern am (œÜ, Œ∏) and on the extrapolation
range. Moreover, the validity of (As3) will be assessed in Section V using practical channel
models.
(As4): the transmitted pilots s(fk ) have a symmetric energy distribution implying that |s(f )|2 =

|s(‚àíf )|2 and

Furthermore, the array pattern am (œÜ, Œ∏) satisfies the following symmetry condition
H
aÃáH
l,œÜ al = aÃál,Œ∏ al = 0,

l = 1, . . . , L.

The symmetric condition on the pilot energy is satisfied in conventional systems such as LTE
or NR since pilots have uniform energy while the condition on the array pattern is generally
satisfied for symmetric arrays. For instance, it is easy to check that the condition is fulfilled
for a rectangular array if each antenna element has an isotropic pattern according to (22) later
studied in Section V. The following bound gives a particularization of the CRLB of (10) under
additional assumptions (As2) ‚àí (As4) and for the MSE averaged over the receive antennas, i.e.,

By adding some assumptions, the CRLB can be greatly simplified and provides much insight
into the physical meaning of the different terms of the bound. We can clearly identify the
two main advantages of high-resolution channel estimation. As compared to the LS estimation
performance that we derived in (8) where the total pilot power is ET = KEs , a gain of a
factor

MK
L

can be observed. This gain comes from two contributions: the array gain M and

the estimation of only L channel coefficients instead of K as in the LS case. However, a loss
factor of 2 appears, coming from the penalty of estimating the azimuth and elevations angles
of each path. Moreover, the channel can be extrapolated in frequency at the cost of a MSE
penalty that quadratically scales with the ratio f /œÉF , which physically makes sense. Indeed,
as the extrapolation range f increases, the estimate quality worsens. On the other hand, as
the uplink training bandwidth increases, the delays of each path are better estimated, which
leads to an improved extrapolation performance. Note that the denominator œÉF indicates that the
extrapolation range can be quantified in multiples of the uplink training band B.
It is interesting to see that the simplified CRLB does not depend on the path parameters œà
for well separated paths. This is in part explained by the fact that each path is well separated,
which cancels the interdependence between different paths. Additionally, the channel frequency
response is evaluated in the direction of the incoming specular waves, canceling the dependence
on the parameters of each path as well as the dependence on the array pattern.
Based on the simplified CRLB, we can find a closed-form expression of the extrapolation
range: we define the Œ≥ extrapolation range, denoted by fExtrapol‚àíŒ≥ , as the frequency f beyond
which the extrapolation performance falls Œ≥ times below that of the conventional LS estimator
given in (8). Using the expressions of (8) and (15), we easily find
r

fExtrapol‚àíŒ≥ = 2œÉF

(16)

Note that this definition is independent of the ratio Es /œÉw2 .
C. Relationship between channel MSE and user SNR
The goal of this section is to find how the user performance is affected by imperfect CSI
at the BS. Let us assume that the BS communicates in the downlink by beamforming in the
direction of the user using a beamforming vector g(f ) ‚àà CM √ó1 . The frequency f denotes the

19

pilot subcarrier frequency at which the symbol d(f ) is transmitted. The BS uses maximum ratio
combining and normalizes the beamforming vector to have unit power so that

The demodulated symbol at the user side is

Œ∑(f )

where the channel h(f ) is considered as deterministic (not random) and Ed,f is the energy
of downlink symbol d(f ). The term Œ∑(f ) is the so-called beamforming efficiency bounded as
0 ‚â§ Œ∑(f ) ‚â§ 1. It represents the beamforming power loss due to imperfect CSI. If it close to 1,
almost no loss is induced. On the other hand, if it is close to 0, the efficiency is strongly affected.
We assume that coherent demodulation can be practically achieved at the user side by including
pilots in the downlink transmission frame. This allows the users to estimate and compensate their
equivalent channel after beamforming by the BS. Note that these pilots are beamformed to each
user. They are thus orthogonal and can be transmitted at the same time-frequency resource to
different users, implying that their overhead is negligible. Moreover, they do not need to be fed
back to the BS. Note that the use of such user-specific reference signals for channel estimation
is a common feature foreseen for 5G NR deployment [36], [37]. In the following, we neglect
their overhead in the spectral efficiency computation. This is motivated by the fact that they are
also present in TDD systems, implying that the comparison remains fair.
The analytical expression of Œ∑(f ) is complicated to compute as it involves the expectation of
a ratio of random variables. Therefore, we propose to approximate the expectation of the ratio

20

by the ratio of expectations, which corresponds to the first-order Taylor expansion of the ratio
around the mean of its numerator and denominator

(18)

where we defined the estimation error e(f ) , hÃÇ(f ) ‚àí h(f ). We expect the approximation Œ∑ÃÇ(f )
to asymptotically converge to Œ∑(f ) as the number of antennas grows large. Indeed, one can
note that both the numerator and the denominator of Œ∑(f ) involve a sum of M elements. Thus,
as M grows large, the estimation error gets better averaged and we expect the numerator and
denominator to converge to their expected value. Based on the statistics of the estimation error
e(f ) derived in previous sections, Œ∑ÃÇ(f ) can be easily computed. Furthermore, for an unbiased
estimator, we have E(e(f )) = 0 and Œ∑ÃÇ(f ) simplifies to
Œ∑ÃÇ(f ) =

kh(f )k2 +

(h(f ))H E(f )h(f )
kh(f )k2

kh(f )k2 + tr [E(f )]

.

(19)

The second term of the numerator has the form of a Rayleigh quotient, which is upper and lower
bounded by the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of matrix E(f ) respectively. This implies that
the numerator is always larger than the denominator, ensuring that Œ∑ÃÇ(f ) ‚â§ 1 as expected.
In the end, we have found an analytical expression that relates the channel estimation error
correlation matrix to the loss in beamforming power at the user side. The corresponding loss
in terms of capacity, spectral efficiency and bit error rate can be directly inferred from the
beamforming efficiency Œ∑ÃÇ(f ). Indeed, the spectral efficiency at extrapolation range f can be
inferred as

where erfc(.) is the complementary error function.
Note that we only considered the performance of a single-user. The same methodology could
be extended to study the performance of multiple users communicating at the same time and
frequency. This type of study can be conducted relying on the formulas derived in this work
for the statistics of the channel estimation errors and using mathematical tools from the random
matrix theory literature [38], [39]. Note that multi-user beamforming is more sensitive to channel
estimation error as it can lead to inter-user interference.
V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
This section evaluates the performance of channel extrapolation for FDD massive MIMO
system. The performance of the conventional LMMSE estimator will be compared to the highresolution estimation based on the SAGE algorithm. The theoretical CRLB of the channel MSE
derived in Section IV-B is also included as a benchmark. Furthermore, the beamforming efficiency
studied in Section IV-C will be used to relate the MSE of the channel estimates to the user link
performance in terms of SNR and spectral efficiency. Finally, graphs will include the performance
of a corresponding TDD system. We emphasize that the loss of performance of the FDD versus
TDD comes from the less accurate channel state information due to extrapolation. The TDD
performance can be simply inferred from the previous analytical results as the performance
related to the in-band channel estimation, which amounts to channel interpolation based on pilot
estimates rather than extrapolation in the FDD mode.
In the simulations, we assumed that the pilots s(fk ) have uniform energy distribution over
the K frequency points fk , i.e., |s(fk )|2 = Es for k = 0, . . . , K ‚àí 1. The pilots are uniformly

/œÑmax for
spaced across the uplink bandwidth B with spacing 1/œÑmax , i.e., fk = k ‚àí K‚àí1
2
k = 0, . . . , K ‚àí 1 and K = BœÑmax + 1. This assumption is consistent with, e.g., the ZhadoffChu training sequences in LTE and NR. We set œÑmax = 2.5¬µs. The center frequency of the uplink
training band is set to fc = 3.5 GHz. Note that our system model is in baseband frequency.
Hence, the carrier frequency fc corresponds to a zero baseband frequency (f = 0). We consider
a synthetic rectangular planar array at the BS with an inter-antenna element spacing of Œªc /2
where Œªc is the center wavelength. The antenna elements have an isotropic pattern so that the
pattern of each element becomes only a phase shift

Fig. 5. The LMMSE estimator performs poorly in terms of extrapolation while the high resolution SAGE estimator performs
much better and approaches the CRLB. The simplified CRLB, assuming well separated paths, performs close to the CRLB.

where eÃÇ(œÜ, Œ∏) is a unit vector in R3 pointing in the direction of the incoming ray l and the
position of the m-th receive array element is denoted by rm ‚àà R3 with respect to a reference
P
point. The reference point is chosen to ensure that m rm = 0. Note that (22) is frequency
dependent because of the beam squint effect. Three planar array geometries are considered:
M = 4 (2 Horiz. √ó 2 Vert.), M = 16 (4 Horiz. √ó 4 Vert.) and M = 64 (8 Horiz. √ó 8 Vert.).
The channel frequency response and received samples are generated according to (2) and (1)
respectively. The path parameters œà are generated by the QuaDRiGa toolbox [40] according to
the 3D-UMa NLOS model defined by 3GPP TR 36.873 v12.5.0 specifications [41]. We took
on purpose a non line-of-sight scenario to consider a more challenging case as all paths need
to be resolved to properly model the channel instead of only a few in a line-of-sight case. The
average channel power is normalized to one and the per-pilot SNR, defined as SNR , Es /œÉw2 ,
is set to 10 dB.
A. High-Resolution versus LMMSE Estimation
We start by analyzing the performance for a single realization of channel parameters. Fig. 5
compares the performance of the LMMSE and the high-resolution SAGE estimators and the
system parameters M = 16, SNR = 10 dB and B = 20 MHz. This implies that the uplink
pilots belong to the support [‚àí10, 10] MHz, which corresponds to the operating band of a

23

corresponding TDD system since uplink and downlink bands are shared. The performance of
the algorithms was averaged over 1000 noise realizations. A delay step size of

1
50B

= 1 ns and

an angular grid size of 1 degree are used as parameters of the SAGE grid search.
Fig. 5. (a) depicts the performance in terms of the MSE of the channel estimates. The SAGEbased channel extrapolation approaches the MSE performance of the theoretical CRLB. This
implies that the CRLB gives a good indication of the achievable MSE. Furthermore, we can see
in the figure that the CRLB performs close to the simplified one of Proposition 1, obtained under
the assumption of well separated paths. On the other hand, the LMMSE estimator performs worse
than high-resolution, especially out of the training band where the error appears to abruptly jump
to higher values. Indeed, its transition zone is of the order of a few hundreds of kHz, which is
negligible compared to the considered extrapolation range of about 100 MHz. In-band, it also
performs worse than SAGE as it does not exploit the joint spatial-frequency structure of the
channel but performs independent per-antenna estimation.
Fig. 5. (b) shows the beamforming efficiency Œ∑(f ) related to the different estimators. As a
reminder, the beamforming efficiency, studied in Section IV-C, corresponds to the loss of received
signal power due to the impact of incorrect channel estimates on the beamformer. In the case
of perfect CSI, Œ∑(f ) = 1 = 0 dB and the efficiency is maximized. Note that both estimators
perform similarly in-band or in TDD mode. The reduction of Œ∑(f ) as the extrapolation frequency
f increases can be seen as the loss induced in the FDD system as compared to a TDD system.
Here again, the LMMSE performance degrades very quickly out of the band. Note that its
performance gets even worse at some points than a simple uniform beamforming strategy in all
‚àö
directions, i.e., g(f ) = 1/ M implying a beamforming efficiency Œ∑(f ) = 1/M ‚âà ‚àí12 dB. On
the other hand, the SAGE extrapolation approaches the efficiency related to the CRLB and only
suffers from a beamforming power loss of about 2 dB at an extrapolation frequency of 90 MHz.
B. Impact of Number of Antennas
For the same set of channel parameters, Fig. 6 (a) depicts the extrapolation performance for
different numbers of antenna elements. As the number of antennas increases, the resolution in
the angle domain increases and the BS can better resolve the paths. This implies that (As3)
becomes valid and the CRLB converges to the simplified CRLB. Note that, in the M = 4 case,
extrapolation performance in terms of MSE deteriorates quickly as we move away from the
uplink band. The simplified CRLB of Proposition 1 is very close to the full CRLB as soon as

is defined as the extrapolation range beyond which the CRLB falls below Œ≥ times the one of the LS estimator

the array has 16 antennas. Moreover, as the number of antennas M increases, a corresponding
in-band array gain is achieved implying that the curves are shifted 6 dB down as the number of
antennas is multiplied by 4.
In Fig. 6 (b), the extrapolation range fExtrapol‚àíŒ≥ , expressed in (16), is plotted as a function
of the number of antennas. As a reminder, the formula corresponds to the extrapolation range
f beyond which the CRLB performance is Œ≥ times worse than the one of the conventional LS
estimator in-band. The formula is independent of the SNR and assumes that the paths are well
separated, i.e., (As3) is valid. As an example, if the BS has 128 antennas and the uplink training
band is B = 20 MHz, the FDD separation between uplink and downlink bands should be at most
7B = 140 MHz to guarantee that the extrapolation-based FDD downlink MSE performance is
equivalent to the corresponding one of a TDD system using conventional LS estimation.
C. Spectral Efficiency
To evaluate the loss in spectral efficiency of an extrapolation-based FDD system versus a
corresponding TDD system, we use the QuaDRIiGa toolbox to generate the channel parameters
related to 200 users locations randomly distributed in a radius of 200 meters around the BS;

the BS height is 20m above ground. The channel model used is still the 3GPP 3D-UMa NLOS
model. For each user location, we compute the spectral efficiency at frequency f according to
(20) where Œ∑ÃÇ(f ) is computed based on (19) and E(f ) = C(f ) given in (9). The SNR related
to uplink pilots is set to SNR = 10 dB and the downlink SNR on the received symbol is
Ed,f /œÉw2 = 10 dB as well. The uplink training bandwidth is left to 20 MHz.
Fig. 7 (a) plots the cumulative density function (CDF) of the spectral efficiency for two
antenna settings M = 16 and M = 64 and for 4 values of the extrapolation frequency f :
f = 0 corresponds to the uplink carrier frequency, which is in-band and also corresponds
to the downlink performance of a TDD system, f ‚àà {80, 160, 240} MHz corresponds to the
FDD downlink performance of systems working at different extrapolation frequencies. The
performance of a perfect CSI system is also plotted but can hardly be distinguished from the
f = 0 TDD performance. As the extrapolation frequency f increases, the inaccurate CSI induces
a beamforming power loss and a related loss of spectral efficiency for FDD systems as compared
to TDD systems. Note that this loss is much more pronounced for the M = 16 case than
the M = 64 case. This can be explained by the fact that the channel estimation and related
extrapolation is more accurate in the M = 64 case as improved spatial resolution is available.

26

Fig. 7 (b) plots the uncoded symbol error rate performance, computed based on (21) averaged
over the different user locations, for the same parameters in the M = 64 case. A 256-QAM
constellation is considered. Here again, TDD performance (f = 0) and perfect CSI curves fit.
As the extrapolation frequency f increases, the performance of the corresponding FDD system
is degraded but still remains in a 2 dB range from the TDD performance.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
This paper investigated the performance of extrapolation-based FDD massive MIMO systems,
relying on high-resolution parameter estimation. We demonstrated that, under a good calibration
of the BS and favorable propagation conditions, channel extrapolation is a viable solution to
deploy FDD massive MIMO systems. It has the great advantage to drastically reduce the DL
pilot overhead and completely remove the need for a feedback from the users. The price to pay
is a reduction in the quality of the channel estimates, which results in a performance loss in
the user downlink transmission. Theoretical CRLB for the MSE of the extrapolated channel and
the related user SNR performance were derived and validated through numerical simulations.
Our simulation results show that extrapolation-based FDD systems relying on high-resolution
channel estimation are a feasible and attractive solution, even as compared to a corresponding
TDD system. In particular, we showed that the FDD performance only suffers from a 1 to 3 dB
reduction in beamforming power for extrapolation range as large as 200 MHz for a BS equipped
with 64 antennas.
Our future studies will include performance assessment of extensive outdoor measurements.
In particular, the impact of calibration errors and channel modeling errors such as, e.g., dense
multipath components, will require further investigation. Another interesting perspective is to
take into account the impact of multiple antennas at the user side. Intuitively, this should help
the extrapolation as we saw that the performance highly depends on the path separability in at
least one domain, which helps their estimation as being free from the interference of other paths.
In SIMO, paths can only be separated in the delay and angle of arrival domain while in MIMO
they can be additionally separated in the angle of departure domain. Similarly, accounting for
the time variations of the channel could be beneficial too as paths could be separated in the
Doppler domain.

VII. A PPENDIX
Using (11), we can compute the different elements of the Fisher information matrix given
in (12). In the following, we use the notations ksl k2 = ksk2 and ksÃál k2 = ksÃák2 given that the
dependence on the path index vanishes.
First, using (As3), we can show that the off-diagonal blocks of Iœà vanish, i.e., Iœàl ,œàl0 = 0
for l 6= l0 . Indeed, for the diagonal elements of Iœàl ,œàl0 , we find that

Still using (As3), we find the same results for the off-diagonal elements of Iœàl ,œàl0 , l 6= l0 .

Actually, using (As4), we find that the result also holds when l = l0 for the following elements

One can further check that, under (As3), the elements IœÜl Œ∏l0 vanish for l 6= l0 . However, even
under (As4), IœÜl Œ∏l0 does not vanish for l = l0 , i.e.,
