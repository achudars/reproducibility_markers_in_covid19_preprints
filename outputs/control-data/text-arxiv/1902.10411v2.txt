Abstract
We analyse within the framework of resonance chiral theory the hSAµ Aν i and hSVµ Vν i
three-point Green functions, where S, Aµ and Vµ are short for scalar, axial-vector and
vector SU (3) hadronic currents. We construct the necessary Lagrangian such that the
Green functions fulfill the asymptotic constraints, at large momenta, imposed by QCD at
leading order. We study the implications of our results on the spectrum of scalars in the
large-NC limit, and analyse their decays.

Introduction

Green functions of quantum fields convey all the dynamics of a quantum field theory describing
a system of many interacting particles. Their consistent construction in the hadronic low-energy
region (typically E  1 GeV), driven by non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD),
can be thoroughly carried out within the model-independent framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) [1, 2]. The predictability of this theory is however spoiled at O(p4 ) and
higher due to our poor knowledge of the chiral low-energy constants. At higher energies, in the
< E < 2.5 GeV), the construction of the Green
hadronic resonances populated domain (1 GeV ∼
∼
functions has been addressed only under several specific model-dependent assumptions, such as
the Extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model [3–5] and related ones [6]. Different implementations
of large-NC [7–9]: minimal hadronic ansatz [10–12] and resonance chiral theory (RChT) [13–24],
< E), except where
have also been explored in the last decades. At even higher energies (2.5 GeV ∼
very narrow hadronic resonances arise, perturbative QCD starts to provide a correct description.
It is clear that QCD should rule the dynamics of those Green functions. However, our lack
of knowledge of non-perturbative QCD makes that task very difficult and the use of models of
QCD becomes necessary. The construction of those models should include chiral symmetry as
a feature to be fulfilled in its low-energy domain. The properties of the model at high-energies
are more difficult to implement due to hadronization and hence they are not obvious from a
Lagrangian point of view. Several works have addressed this problem within RChT [13], which
provides a framework for the evaluation of the Green functions in the intermediate energy region.
This is a Lagrangian setting in terms of pseudo-Goldstone bosons and resonances (as matter
fields) that, by construction, respect the chiral symmetry. As in ChPT, this symmetry provides
the structure of the operators but gives no information on the coupling constants. However, due
to the presence of resonance fields, the Lagrangian has no obvious counting that controls the
number of operators and, consequently, some extra features are needed in its application. On
one side Green functions are computed using large-NC premises [25]; this translates, essentially,
in a loop expansion generated by the Lagrangian. This is not enough to limit the number of
operators and, in addition, gives no information on the coupling constants. The extra help
comes from the assumption that the correlation functions, as given by RChT (ΠRChT ), can be
matched, at large momenta, with the known asymptotic behaviour of Green functions and form
factors on QCD grounds (ΠQCD ). This sounds feasible as the RChT result (at tree level) and
the operator product expansion (OPE), at O(αS0 ), generate an expansion in inverse powers of
momenta. The method was originally applied to two-point Green functions in Ref. [14] and
later to three-point functions [15, 16] as:

Short-distance constraints are also imposed on vertex functions (form factors) by considering
their Brodsky-Lepage [26] asymptotic behaviour, using parton dynamics [14, 27]. These approaches can provide valuable information on the structure of the operators and their coupling
constants. Moreover, as the later do not depend on the masses of the pseudo-Goldstone bosons,
the procedure can be carried out in the chiral limit. The question of the feasibility of this
matching was discussed in Ref. [6].
The above-mentioned procedure is particularly transparent for Green functions that are or1

der parameters of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry, i.e. those that do not
receive contributions of perturbative QCD, in the chiral limit, at large momentum transfers
and, therefore, show a rather smooth behaviour. Several works along this line have been produced [16–22, 24] with noticeable results. One of the key issues in order to carry out the
matching procedure in Eq. (1) lies in the construction of the appropriate operators in the RChT
Lagrangian that make the matching possible. The procedure may not always be feasible [6],
but most of the time it is just a matter of looking for the suitable operators. In Ref. [28] it
was pointed out the difficulty involved in the matching for the hSVµ Vν i Green function (where
S and Vµ are short for scalar and vector QCD currents, respectively) using a Proca representation for the vector resonance fields in RChT. As expected, the authors satisfied the matching
by including a higher order (in derivatives) RChT operator that was needed to enforce the
QCD short-distance behaviour even though it was non-leading at low energies. In this article
we perform a systematic analysis of the hSVµ Vν i and hSAµ Aν i Green functions (Aµ is short for
axial-vector QCD current) using an antisymmetric representation for the spin-1 resonances in the
RChT framework. We will fulfill the matching indicated by Eq. (1) for both Green functions by
constructing a minimal set of RChT operators that provide the correct short-distance behaviour.
We consider tree-level diagrams only and, accordingly, work in the NC → ∞ limit. Moreover
we restrict our large-NC description to only one multiplet for each hadron type: scalars, vectors
and axial-vectors. As a final result we obtain several relations between the relevant coupling
constants of the Lagrangian.
The description, classification and dynamics of hadronic scalar meson resonances, with
< 2 GeV, has a long story of successes and failures (see the corresponding note
masses MS ∼
in Ref. [29]). The light-quark spectrum of meson resonances is populated by many scalar states
whose identification as SU (3) octets/nonets is far from clear and that are, probably, an admixture of exotic states that involve tetraquarks or even glueballs. The unsolved non-perturbative
dynamics does not allow us to identify the nature of the bound states generated by QCD.
Experimentally one observes a number of J P = 0+ states that could fit into two U (3) nonets
constituted by quarks. Our present knowledge points out to usual [qq] states but also tetraquark
ones [qq][qq] [30]. The existence of a glueball (with J P = 0+ and of similar properties to the
quark resonances) with mass in the upper part of our spectrum (∼ 2 GeV) was also pointed out
some time ago by the lattice [31, 32]. Hence it is expected that all the scalar resonances in this
energy region could be an admixture of all these basic states.
By construction, the leading multiplets of resonances described by RChT should correspond
to those remaining in the NC → ∞ limit. However, while this identification does not create
discussion for vector, axial-vector and pseudoscalar resonances, the scalar case is much more
complex. In Ref. [33] a study within RChT in the large-NC framework identified the preferred
lightest scalar nonet as the one constituted by S∞ = {f0 (980), K0∗ (1430), a0 (1450), f0 (1500)},
assuming that the a0 (980) is dynamically generated and making an octet together with f0 (500)
and K0∗ (700) as a subleading spectrum. In Ref. [34], a new method to study the large-NC
behavior of the final states interactions (FSI) within the dispersive approach was proposed. The
NC trajectories of the poles suggest that f0 (980) and f0 (1370) should have the [qq] component.
This is further confirmed in Ref. [35], by studying the semi-local duality in the large-NC limit.
Finally, there is also a broad consensus that S∞ corresponds to the [qq] structure while the
lightest nonet of resonances is constituted by [qq][qq] [30, 36] (and references therein), with a

2

possible large mixing between them. Even though we basically agree with this description, we
will modify it slightly in order to include the f0 (1370) and the f0 (1710), aiming to account for
the glueball in our framework.
Although the experimental situation of the scalar decays is rather poor and uncertain [29],
we intend to analyse the two-pseudoscalar decays of the spectrum of scalars in RChT, i.e. the
S → P P decays of the leading multiplet in the NC → ∞ limit. In doing so, we will use the
minimal set of operators in this framework. We will conclude that meanwhile the short-distance
matching procedure of the three-point Green functions requires higher derivative operators in
some cases, we do not need to introduce subleading operators (in the large-NC counting) to
fulfill the matching. On the contrary, the experimental data on the S → P P decays will require
to break manifestly that counting by introducing subleading operators. Hence we conclude
that the scalar related couplings in the matching of the Green functions are not given by the
NC → ∞ limit.
In Section 2 we recall the RChT framework within our large-NC model, leaving for Section
3 the matching procedure for the hSAµ Aν i and hSVµ Vν i three-point Green functions. Section 4
is devoted to explain the features of our scalar resonance sector and the results of their decays
into two pseudoscalar mesons. We establish our conclusions in Section 5. The chiral notation
and several analytical expressions on the decays of scalars into other final states are given in
the Appendices.

The large-NC setting: resonance chiral theory

RChT is a Lagrangian framework that includes the interaction between the chiral pseudoscalar
octet of mesons, in ChPT, and the hadron resonances in the energy region up to ∼ 2 GeV. The
symmetries driving the operators are both the chiral (SU (N )L ⊗ SU (N )R ) and flavour (SU (N ))
symmetries, for light flavours, N = 2, 3 [13, 14, 20]. By construction the RChT method matches
the chiral symmetric results at low energies. Here we only recall the content needed for our
present work. We will only consider scalar, vector and axial-vector resonances, and the case
with N = 3 flavours. For a detailed account and notation we refer the reader to Refs. [20, 25]
and Appendix A.
The RChT framework starts with the leading chiral Lagrangian involving only the octet of
pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons (GB) and external currents. It is given by:
ChPT
LGB
=
(2) = L(2)

F2
h uµ uµ + χ+ i ,
4

(2)

where F is the decay constant of the pion in the chiral limit, and the symbol h·i stands for
the trace in flavour space. This term collects the information on the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the chiral symmetry and coincides with the same order Lagrangian of ChPT.
RChT has no defined parameter (in the Lagrangian) on which to build a qualified counting to
establish a classification for the operators. As the integration of the resonances should provide,
generically, the ChPT Lagrangian of O(pn ), for n > 2, it has been customary to classify the
RChT operators by the order in momenta of the ChPT operators that they were producing upon
integration. Therefore the general structure of the operators is O ∼ hR1 R2 ...Rp χ(pn ) i, with Ra
a U (3) nonet of resonance fields, namely Vµν (vector), Aµν (axial-vector) and S (scalar). Notice
3

that we will use the antisymmetric representation for the spin-1 fields [37], given its relevance
in the chiral framework [1,14]. In addition, χ(pn ) is a tensor (constructed with chiral invariants
in terms of the pseudoscalar Goldstone fields and external currents of ChPT) of n chiral order
(see Appendix A). The operators giving the O(p4 ) terms in the chiral Lagrangian are of the
type hRa χ(p2 ) i:

FA

2 2
= cd h S uµ uµ i + cm h S χ+ i ,
=

(3)

where the real couplings: FV , GV , FA , cd and cm are, a priori, unknown. Those generating
the O(p6 ) chiral Lagrangian have been studied in Ref. [20] and have the general structures:
h Ra χ(p4 ) i, h Ra Rb χ(p2 ) i and h Ra Rb Rc i. We will collect those of interest for our study in
the next section.
It would also be possible to classify the operators into sets that provide the correct asymptotic
behaviour of definite n-point Green function of QCD currents, that is, the relation in Eq. (1). As
has been concluded in previous studies of these Green functions, one starts with the two-point
Green function (and related form factors) and determines the appropriate set of operators and
relations between couplings. For instance the study of two-point Green functions, with only one
multiplet of resonances (single resonance approximation), gives [14, 38–42]:
FV GV = F 2 ,
4 cd cm = F 2 ,

FV2 − FA2 = F 2 ,
cd = cm ,

FV2 MV2 = FA2 MA2 ,
(4)

for the couplings in Eqs. (2,3). Here MV and MA are the masses of the vector and axialvector nonet, respectively. When the study is extended to three-point Green functions one may
determine an extended set of operators and the initial relations between couplings could be
modified [15–22, 24], and so on.
A comment on the nature of the resonances described in the Lagrangian of RChT is needed.
This framework is embedded in a large-NC setting. Accordingly, the spectrum described in the
Lagrangian corresponds to states that stay in the NC → ∞ limit. Thus our framework cannot
contain resonances that are generated by the Lagrangian (for instance on accounts of unitarity)
because these are subleading in the 1/NC expansion. A clear case is the f0 (500), generated by
(or coincident with) a strong ππ wide s-wave.
Together with LGB
(2) in Eq. (2) and the Lagrangian involving resonances, RChT requires the
addition of operators with the same structure as the ones in the ChPT Lagrangian at O(p4 ) [2],
O(p6 ) [43], and so on, although with different couplings. It is well known that the low-energy
couplings in ChPT are, at least at O(p4 ), mostly saturated by the contribution of the lightest
multiplets of resonances [14]. At O(p6 ) the situation is less clear. Since the couplings are
GB
different from their ChPT counterparts, we will denote them as L̂i and Ĉi (for LGB
(4) and L(6) ,
respectively):

i
LGB
L̂i O(4)

Notice that the dimension of the couplings are [L̂i ] = E 0 and [Ĉi ] = E −2 .
In this article we intend to analyse the three-point Green functions h S Vµ Vν i and h S Aµ Aν i,
imposing the asymptotic behavior in Eq. (1), at leading order in the 1/NC expansion. In
practice this means that we will evaluate the three-point Green functions in RChT with treelevel diagrams only. For consistency, we should include in our computations an infinite set
of resonances. We do not know how to do this in a model-independent way. However, there
are good phenomenological reasons that indicate that the lowest mass states (surviving in the
NC → ∞ limit) contribute dominantly, as has been shown for instance in the determinations
of the O(p4 ) low-energy couplings [13]. This is in agreement with the usual decoupling of
effective field theories where the contributions from heavy mass states to the low-energy theory
is suppressed by powers of E/M , with E the energy scale of the effective theory and M the
mass of the decoupled state. Accordingly, we model our NC → ∞ setting by including only the
lightest multiplet of resonances for each hadron type.
The identification of the nonets in Eq. (3) is simple for vector states [29]: Vµν (1− ) =
{ρ(770), K ∗ (892), ω(782), φ(1020)}. For axial-vector mesons the situation is slightly more complicated [33]: Aµν (1+ ) = {a0 (1260), K1 (1270), f1 (1285), f1 (1420)}, since the strange doublet
could also be K1 (1400) or an admixture of both. The common feature of these two multiplets
is that they correspond to the lightest states (experimentally identified) with those quantum
numbers. For the scalar resonance case (and the glueball) the identification of the lightest nonet,
surviving at NC → ∞, seems not to concur with the lightest nonet but with one of higher mass.
We delay this discussion to Section 4.

Three-point Green functions from RChT

Similarly to the relations in Eq. (4), based on two-point Green functions, one can obtain additional constraints on the RChT couplings by analyzing the three-point Green functions. A lot
of work has already been employed in their study [6, 15–22, 24]. Here we focus on the scalarinvolved Green functions h S Aµ Aν i and h S Vµ Vν i. Both of them are order parameters of the
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and, consequently, vanish at O(αS0 ) in the chiral limit.
The definition of these Green functions is given by

where Γi = 2 for the scalar current, Γi = γµ for the vector current and Γi = γµ γ5 for the
axial-vector current. Our conventions for the momenta are defined in Figure 1. We will proceed
to determine the general structure of those Green functions as provided by their chiral Ward
identities, SU (3)V , parity and time reversal. Then we will obtain their short-distance behaviour
at leading order in the momenta expansion. We also calculate their expressions using RChT
and including the necessary operators such that we have a perfect matching in the momenta
expansion, following the relation in Eq. (1). A simplifying aspect of the procedure is that, since
the couplings do not depend on the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons, we can perform this
operation in the chiral limit. Since our Green functions are order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking, this implies that there is no perturbative contribution in the parton calculation,
at least at O(αS0 ).

It is interesting to observe that the low-energy couplings of the GB Lagrangians vanish. This
strengthens the notion of resonance dominance of the chiral couplings.

(2) is defined in Eq. (2), L(4) and L(6) are defined in Eq. (5), L(2) and L(2) are specified
in Eq. (3) and LV includes interaction terms between scalar, vector resonances, and external
currents. There is a key difference between the operators needed to match the Green function
in the hSAµ Aν i case and the present ones. The Lagrangian LA only includes those operators
that, upon integration of the resonance, contributes to the ChPT O(p6 ) Lagrangian. Contrary
to the hSAµ Aν i case, these operators are not enough to achieve the matching in the hSVµ Vν i
case. More precisely, if we only include the operators in Table 2 we would get GV (p21 , p22 , q 2 ) = 0
and, therefore, we would not be able to fulfill the matching. We thus need to include additional
operators that are listed in Table 3. They have the chiral structure: hRχ(p6 )i, hRRχ(p4 )i and
hRRRχ(p2 )i and yield contributions to both FV and GV .
The complete set of diagrams contributing to hSVµ Vν i is given in Figure 5. The resulting

Notice that, in this case, the local contribution from LGB
(6) , namely Ĉ61 , is not forced to vanish
by the short-distance constraints. Our Lagrangian, defined in Eq. (30), generates both FV and
GV functions, and is able to satisfy the short-distance relations.

3.3

RChT coupling constants

The relations between the RChT couplings obtained in Eqs. (20,34) rely on the assumptions of
short-distance QCD asymptotic behavior and single resonance approximation. We may wonder
how reliable are those assumptions. If our implementation of large-NC was exact (i.e. if we had
included an infinite number of resonances) we could argue that our computation should receive
∼ 33 % one-loop corrections. In practice this is a rough estimate because we cannot evaluate
the error introduced by imposing the asymptotic behavior. Because of these uncertainties, one
should expect slight modifications to the relations obtained in Eqs. (20,34). In our opinion the
largest source of uncertainty arises from the lack of a more thorough implementation of the
large-NC description.
It is well known that the phenomenology of hadron processes indicates that large-NC is
a reasonable assumption for spin-1 related processes, but fails for scalar (vacuum) quantum
numbers. 2 In this case, higher-order 1/NC corrections seem to be particularly relevant. Let
us consider, for instance, the case of the cd and cm couplings in Eq. (3) with the constraints in
Eq. (4). One would conclude that in the single resonance approximation we have:
cd = cm =

F
.
2

(36)

Taking F = 92.4 MeV we get cd = cm = 46.2 MeV. However, the phenomenology of different
< c
<
processes (I = 1/2 and I = 3/2 Kπ s-wave scattering, a0 (980) decay) gives 13 MeV ∼
d ∼
<
<
40 MeV and 30 MeV ∼ cm ∼ 100 MeV (see [44] and references therein). While the condition
4 cd cm = F 2 is rather well satisfied, there seems to be some tension between the phenomenological values of cd and cm and the relation cd = cm . Given the large uncertainties, we cannot
reliably estimate the error of our large-NC result (36) (in single resonance approximation), but
it could be off even by a factor of 3 (for cd ) or 2 (for cm ) in the worst case.
We conclude that our relations in Eq. (20,34) may be affected by errors of similar size to the
case above. The order of magnitude is expected to be correct but notable deviations may arise.
Unfortunately, we cannot constrain most of the couplings with the present phenomenological
status. However we can get reliable estimates in certain couplings, such as cd and cm , which
appear in the decays of a scalar to two pseudoscalars. We will pursue this in Section 4.
In summary, our present knowledge of the hadron scalar spectrum, and its decays, is rather
poor [29] and the couplings involved are essentially unknown. On one hand, we need to identify
which is the spectrum described by the RChT (or any other) framework. On the other hand, we
lack the required experimental data to have a general vision of the accuracy of our results. In
the next section we will try to clarify part of the phenomenological status of scalar resonances.
2

As a general setting, meson-vector form factors are well described in a NC → ∞ framework in RChT. On
the contrary, a resummation of many loops is usually required to provide a reasonable account of scalar form
factors.

Scalar couplings

Which are the, experimentally identified, scalar states present in our Lagrangian? As commented at the end of Section 2, there is almost no discussion on the identification of the vector
and axial-vector resonances of the RChT Lagrangian. They are, in fact, the lightest hadron
resonances in the spectrum with those quantum numbers. Scalars (and glueballs) are different.
< 2 GeV) generates
They carry the vacuum quantum numbers and their identification (for M ∼
controversy. Here, we will comment first several, more or less agreed, features and we will
propose a scheme.
As discussed in Section 2 the lightest scalar resonance, namely the isosinglet f0 (500), corresponds to a wide ππ s-wave that does not survive the NC → ∞ limit. Increasing in mass we have
K0∗ (700), the isotriplet a0 (980) and the isosinglet f0 (980). The next scalar appears at around
1.4 GeV. Hence, naively, one could consider that the first U (3) nonet of scalar resonances is the
one with those states: SL = {f0 (500), K0∗ (700), a0 (980), f0 (980)}. Following this scheme, determined by the mass, the next nonet would be: SH = {f0 (1370), K0∗ (1430), a0 (1450), f0 (1500)}.
Until ∼ 2 GeV there is another isosinglet scalar: f0 (1710). Other scalars appear around 2 GeV.
Needless to say that the physical states do not need to correspond exactly with the basis in the
Lagrangian and mixing between those with the same quantum numbers surely arise. If our assumption, relying on the mass, was correct, we could conclude that SL would correspond to the
nonet that vanishes at NC → ∞, as it includes the f0 (500). A thorough analysis in this limit was
carried out in Ref. [33]. Their conclusion was that the most favored candidates for the leading
nonet in the infinite number of colors limit was: S∞ = {f0 (980), K0∗ (1430), a0 (1450), f0 (1500)}.
Another aspect of the spectrum of scalars is related with their quark content. This is of no
relevance for the RChT Lagrangian: it can allocate any quark content. However it is suitable to
collect this information here. We will reduce our comment to [q̄ q] and [q̄ q][q̄ q] states (see [30]
and references therein). One aspect that distinguishes the quark structure of the nonets is that,
in the ideal mixing case, the tetraquark multiplet has an inverted spectrum: the isodoublet
is heavier than the isotriplet. We see that this feature (the order in the spectrum) is clearly
described by SL above, while they are essentially degenerated (within errors [29]) in the case
of SH . This feature could be the result of a violation of the ideal mixing. There are also other
reasons to conclude that the light nonet corresponds to the tetraquark structure while the heavy
one is the usual [q̄q] [30].
In this section we will identify the nonet of scalar resonances in our RChT Lagrangian with
the SH nonet above. We will also consider the singlet f0 (1710) and a general mixing between the
isosinglet fields that generates the physical states, including a possible glueball. As commented
in Subsection 3.3, the phenomenology seems to indicate that the NC → ∞ limit is rather poor
when scalars are involved. Hence, in our analysis, we will include subleading contributions into
the Lagrangian in order to accommodate the experimental figures within their large errors. This
will allow us to get more accurate determinations of the leading cd and cm couplings.
Similar studies have been carried out in the last years, see for instance [45–52] and references
therein.

S → P P : isodoublet and isotriplet decays

4.1

We will consider a RChT framework with violation of the NC → ∞ limit in the tree level
Lagrangian. More precisely, we will consider terms with more than one trace in flavour space.
Previous studies [46] have pointed out a non-negligible mixing between the I = 1, 1/2 states of
both nonets SL and SH . Hence we will include a mixing between them. The Lagrangian reads:
LI=1,1/2

The mixing angles ϕa and ϕk are not fixed. In Ref. [46] the values quoted are ϕa = π/4 and
ϕk ∼ 0.17 π. We will consider them as free parameters. The lack of data on the FSI phase
shifts for the decays of these fields prevents the inclusion of these effects in our analysis. The
amplitudes for such decays are collected in Subsection B.1 of Appendix B.

S → P P : isosinglet decays

4.2

As commented before, we are interested in the description of the decays of the f0 (1370), f0 (1510)
and f0 (1710). Although we identify the first two as those of the SH multiplet and the third as a
possible glueball, the real situation can be much more cumbersome and the real physical states
is surely a non-neglible mixing between the isosinglets of the SH multiplet (namely S8 ,S0 ) and
an extra singlet (S1 ). A general rotation of them will provide the physical states:

(40)
Now we set up our RChT framework to describe these decays. Contrary to the first decays,
we are not going to consider mixing between the light and heavy multiplets. This would give
a complicated setting with many parameters and, as we will conclude, it is not necessary to
provide a reasonable description of all the decays.
With these inputs the Lagrangian to study the f0 → P P decays will be:

Furthermore, as the ππ and KK phase shifts are rather well known [53, 54] we also incorporate
the parameterization of final state interactions as described in Appendix C. The amplitudes for
these decays are gathered in Subsection B.2 of Appendix B.

4.3

Results

The present experimental determination of the S → P P decay widths is rather poor. Many
channels have not been observed or have large errors. As a result, we end up with more variables
than experimental inputs. However, from our fit we can obtain a general idea of the current
landscape.
We will fit our partial widths and ratios with the data collected in the rightmost column of
Tables 4 and 5. We input the masses of the resonances from [29], with the exception of the
a0 (980) and f0 (1370). The first one is also fitted due to the sensibility of the results to its decay.
For f0 (1370) we take the result put forward by [58] in the analysis of its dominant decay into
four pions, Mf0 (1370) = 1.395 GeV. We take F = 92.4 MeV for the decay constant of the pion.
Our results for the fit are presented in the central column of Tables 4 and 5. As we can
see, we obtain a reasonable description of most of the channels (being the clear exception
the K0∗ (700) → πK decay). We get a null value for Γ (f0 (1500) → ηη 0 ) since this decay is
kinematically forbidden for the central value of the f0 (1500) mass. The results for masses,
couplings and parameters are collected in Table 6. We are going to analyse, in turn, the
outcome:
a) We obtain the mixing angles between the I = 0 states, α, β, γ with rather large errors.
To illustrate the results let us change to the flavour basis, |Si, |N i, |Gi, defined by:

being |Gi the singlet glueball. In this basis we have:

(43)

From this result we conclude that there is a dominant one-to-one identification between
f0 (1370),f0 (1500) and f0 (1710) with N , S and G respectively. Notwithstanding there
seems to be also a large mixing between f0 (1370) and f0 (1710) with the N and G states.
Our result agrees with solution II of Ref. [62]. Their solution I switches the roles of f0 (1500)
and f0 (1710). Different models and different settings can be found in the literature. Our
conclusion differs from the one in Ref. [47] because although they agree on identifying the
f0 (1710) mostly with the glueball, they find that f0 (1370) is dominantly |Si and f0 (1500)

is dominantly |N i. This later identification of f0 (1370) is also found in Ref. [50], though
with a noticeable four-quark component too. In Ref. [49] it was concluded that f0 (1500)
was mostly glueball but f0 (1710) was also sharing a large component. Ref. [63] provides
two scenarios: In one of them f0 (1710) is dominantly glueball; in the other this role
corresponds to f0 (1500).
In relation with the mixing between the light and heavy nonets of scalar resonances, our
results differ from those of Ref. [46], and we find a tiny mixing for the a0 states and an
almost inverted situation for the K0∗ states.
2/ The couplings in Eq. (41), c0d ,c0m and γ 0 , involving the extra singlet S1 (glueball), are
consistent with zero. This indicates that the glueball component only arises through the
mixing with the I = 0 singlets of the nonet.
3/ The rest of RChT couplings show an interesting trend. Although with large errors, the
expected 1/NC suppression between the leading and next-to-leading terms does not seem
to be realized. They are essentially of the same order. We verify that both multiplets
H
satisfy the condition in Eq. (4): cLd cLm > 0 and cH
d cm > 0, but we notice that the relation
cd = cm is approximately satisfied only by the light multiplet cLd ∼ cLm . Meanwhile the
heavy multiplet deviates from this relation. None of them satisfies, numerically, Eq. (36),
though the light multiplet comes close.

Conclusions

The phenomenology of the lightest hadron scalars is rather clumsy. The issues of identification
of the U (3) nonets, its nature and their decays embrace a thorough research and a large number
of publications. Many aspects remain to be understood. In this work we have tried to put
some light on the features and problems that have to be taken into account for a Lagrangian
description of the scalar sector; in our case within the Resonance Chiral Theory.
The greater part of the decays of scalar resonances involve the h S Vµ Vν i and h S Aµ Aν i
Green functions of QCD currents. We have analysed these within RChT, including the necessary
operators in order to fulfill the short-distance requirements determined by the matching in
Eq. (1). As a result we found a set of relations between the couplings in our Lagrangian.
These should be valid in the NC → ∞ limit and single resonance approximation. Although the
procedure that we have followed has given in the past many successful predictions, we know
that hadron scalar-involved amplitudes are not well behaved in the large-NC limit. In order to
assess our results, we have carried out a fit to S → P P decays in Section 4. In the fit we have
included subleading contributions in 1/NC , to analyze the behavior of our RChT description
of such decays. The results of our study are indeed pointing out that operators that should
be suppressed following large-NC premises are in fact as relevant as the leading ones. Hence,
at least part of the relations between the couplings involving scalars, in the NC → ∞ limit,
may be largely violated. We have to stress, though, that the poor, and sometimes confusing,
experimental determinations in most of the scalar decays could mislead this conclusion. It will
be important to improve the experimental measurements in order to validate this scenario.
As a consequence of our study we also conclude that, within errors, f0 (1370) is dominantly
a |uu + ddi state, f0 (1710) is dominantly a glueball, but both of them also have a noticeable
20

mixing. The f0 (1500) is dominantly a |ssi state. The results by other authors vary, however
the use of different frameworks make the comparison difficult.
The study of hadron scalar resonances remains an open field. Their spectrum, classification
and nature originate a rich debate. The large-NC framework, already questioned in the study
of these decays, does not seem to be the proper setting because of the large size of subleading
corrections. However a solid conclusion will only be possible if a better experimental knowledge
of the spectrum and decays is achieved.

The nonlinear realization of SU (3)L ⊗ SU (3)R on resonance fields depends on their transformation properties under the unbroken SU (3)V , the flavour group. Here we will consider massive
states transforming as octets (R8 ) or singlets (R0 ), with R = V, A, S, P for vector, axial-vector,
scalar and pseudoscalar fields, respectively. In the large-NC limit both become degenerate in

(A.3)

We will use the antisymmetric representation for the spin-1 fields [37]. In order to calculate
Green functions of vector, axial-vector and scalar currents, it is convenient to include external
hermitian sources `µ (x) (left), rµ (x) (right), s(x) (scalar) and p(x) (pseudoscalar).
With the fundamental building blocks u(φ), Vµν , Aµν , S, `µ , rµ , s and p, the hadronic
Lagrangian is given by the most general set of monomials invariant under Lorentz, chiral, P and
C transformations. At leading order in 1/NC , the monomials should be constructed by taking
a single trace of products of chiral operators (exceptions to this rule are not of interest for our
research). The chiral tensors χ(pn ), i.e. those not including resonance fields, can be labeled
according to the chiral power counting. The independent building blocks of lowest dimension
are:

The covariant derivative is defined by ∇µ X = ∂µ X + [Γµ , X], in terms of the chiral connection
Γµ = {u† (∂µ − irµ )u + u(∂µ − i`µ )u† }/2 for any operator X transforming as an octet of SU (3)V .
Higher-order chiral tensors can be obtained by taking products of lower-dimensional building
blocks or by acting on them with the covariant derivative.

Final State Interactions in fi → P P decays

We know that I = 0, S = 0 amplitudes have large FSI effects. Unfortunately we only have
reliable information on the ππ and KK phase-shifts. Hence we can only consider the FSI
effects in the decays with those final states. We would expect that I = 1 or I = 1/2 final states
should be less affected and, therefore, we will consider only fi → P P decays (i = 1, 2, 3 as in
Appendix B), with P = π, K.
Following Refs. [64, 65], we can parameterize:

Here ω should be a new parameter to fit. For the phase-shifts we will only need δππ
(Mf2i )
I=0
and δKK
(Mf2i ), because in two-body decays always s = M 2 being M the mass of the decaying
particle. The phase shifts are given by the extended K-matrix fit following [53, 54], up to
1.8 GeV. We will consider the results in Table C.1.
