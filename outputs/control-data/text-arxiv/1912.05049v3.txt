We consider a driven, non-Hermitian generalization of the Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model.
We show that the introduction of periodic driving allows us to obtain fully real quasienergy spectra
in configurations where the corresponding static system has complex energy eigenvalues for any nonHermitian degree. We illustrate how generalized parity-time (P T ) symmetry can be applied within
the Floquet formalism and show that our model‚Äôs fully real quasienergy spectrum corresponds to an
unbroken symmetry. This model exhibits a Floquet topological phase, few examples of have been
found in non-Hermitian potentials.

INTRODUCTION

Floquet topological phases are of great current interest. It has been shown that a wide range of topological phases in lattices with static potentials possess
analogs in systems with periodically driven potentials
(‚ÄúFloquet‚Äù systems); furthermore, some of these Floquet
systems exhibit topological states that do not exist in
static systems [1‚Äì10]. Floquet topological phases have
also been observed experimentally in photonic systems
[11‚Äì14], single-photon quantum walks [15, 16], and ultracold atoms [17].
For systems with periodically varying potentials, the
long-time behavior is governed by Floquet quasienergies,
which are constant over time and analogous to the energy eigenvalues governing the behavior of static systems.
Like the energy eigenvalues of static systems, quasienergies must be real in order to conserve probability. In
order to guarantee the reality of the energy spectrum
for static systems, or the reality of the quasienergy spectrum for Floquet systems, it is conventional to require
that the Hamiltonian of the system be Hermitian. However, the requirement of Hermiticity can be relaxed. It
was first shown in static systems that non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians can yield real energy spectra if the system is parity-time (P T ) symmetric, meaning that the
Hamiltonian commutes with the combined parity-time
reversal operator [18]. P T -symmetric systems have two
phases: a phase of ‚Äúunbroken‚Äù symmetry, where energies
are fully real, and a phase of ‚Äúbroken‚Äù symmetry, where
(quasi)energies come in complex-conjugate pairs. P T symmetric systems have been experimentally realized in
photonic waveguides [19‚Äì26] and laser systems [27‚Äì30],
among others [31, 32]. In static P T -symmetric systems,
a number of topological phases have also been predicted,
some of which have no Hermitian analogs [24, 25, 33‚Äì44].
The investigation of P T -symmetric systems with topological phases has recently broadened to include Floquet
systems [45‚Äì51]. As discussed above, Floquet topological
phases have proved a rich area of study [1‚Äì17]; however,
most investigations of Floquet topological phases to date
have taken place in the context of Hermitian dynamics.
In this work, we extend the definition of P T symmetry
from Ref. [18] to the Floquet formalism and generalize

our definition to a class of operators analogous to P T ,
similar to previous studies of generalized P T symmetry
in static systems [52]. We consider a time-dependent
generalization of the Aubry-AndreÃÅ-Harper (AAH) model
[53, 54] that possesses an analog of P T symmetry. The
off-diagonal AAH model is a 1D tight-binding lattice with
spatially periodic (or quasiperiodic) tunneling elements
[55]. The Hamiltonian of an N -site, off-diagonal AAH
lattice is given by
H0 =

N
‚àí1
X

tn a‚Ä†n an+1 + h.c.,

n=1

tn = ‚àíJ(1 + Œª cos(2œÄŒ≤n + Œ¶)),

(1)

where a‚Ä†n and an are the creation and annihilation operators for a fermion at lattice site n. Here, J sets the energy
scale of tunneling, while Œª is the tunneling modulation
strength, Œ¶ gives the tunneling phase, and Œ≤ determines
the tunneling period. Configurations with rational values
of Œ≤ have spatially periodic tunneling elements and are
therefore termed ‚Äúcommensurate‚Äù models. Configurations with irrational values of Œ≤ have quasi-periodic tunneling elements and are called ‚Äúincommensurate‚Äù models.
This model exhibits a rich array of physical phenomena.
For rational Œ≤ of the form Œ≤ = 1/p, where p is an integer,
the energy spectrum has p bands. When p is even, zero
energy modes exist for ranges of Œ¶ determined by the
values of p and N , and furthermore these energy modes
correspond to topologically protected states located to
the edges of the lattice [33, 55]. (For example, Ref. [33]
shows that for Œ≤ = 1/2, 0 ‚â§ Œ¶ ‚â§ 2œÄ gives topological
modes when N is odd, and œÄ2 ‚â§ Œ¶ ‚â§ 3œÄ
2 gives topological
modes when N is even.) For irrational Œ≤, the spectrum
has a fractional number of bands, and states within the
band gaps are localized to the edges.
Refs. [33, 34] discuss a non-Hermitian generalization
of the AAH model. Their lattice has the same tunneling profile as the original off-diagonal AAH lattice,
but two imaginary-energy defects are placed at reflectionsymmetric sites. For this system, the reality of the energy
spectrum is preserved for particular defect locations and
lattice sizes, and the topological modes of the commensurate model persist in the presence of imaginary-energy
defects.

2
In this work, we demonstrate that by periodically driving the strengths of the non-Hermitian impurities, we
obtain real quasienergy spectra for configurations whose
static analogs have complex spectra for any strength of
non-Hermitian defect. In section II, we introduced the
model and give a brief overview of the Floquet formalism.
In section III, we show how the reality of the quasienergy
spectrum can be explained in terms of a symmetry of
the Hamiltonian. To do this, we show how the definition of P T symmetry can be applied within the Floquet formalism and that a fully real quasienergy spectrum corresponds to an unbroken symmetry analogous to
P T symmetry. In section IV, we show that the mid-gap
quasienergy modes of the system are topologically protected. As in the static AAH lattice, these topological
modes are closely connected to Majorana bound states
[55, 56].

II.

2 would create a system analogous to the passive P T
lattices implemented in [19, 22, 23, 25, 26]. In our original model, a fully real quasienergy spectrum corresponds
to a phase of unbroken symmetry (as will be discussed
in Section III A). Once a background of loss is added,
the phase of unbroken symmetry would correspond to a
slower rate of decay than the phase of broken symmetry
[19].
The behavior of a periodically driven system can
be characterized by the system‚Äôs Floquet quasienergies,
which are analogous to the energy eigenvalues of a static
potential, and Floquet states, which describe the evolution of the system over time [57‚Äì59]. In order to determine the Floquet quasienergies (and, in Section III D, the
Floquet states) of the system, we employ the methods of
Refs. [57‚Äì59]. The Floquet theorem states that, given a
periodic potential V (t) of period T = 2œÄ/œâ, the solutions
of the time-dependent SchroÃàdinger equation

MODEL AND THE FLOQUET FORMALISM

We consider a time-dependent generalized AAH lattice
whose Hamiltonian is of the form
H(t) = H0 + V (t),
V (t) = iŒ≥ cos(œât)(a‚Ä†m0 am0 ‚àí a‚Ä†mÃÑ0 amÃÑ0 ).

(2)

where H0 is the static AAH Hamiltonian given in Eq. 1
and V (t) is a time-dependent perturbation giving gain
and loss.
Like the unperturbed AAH lattice, tunneling elements
are spatially periodic (quasi-periodic) for rational (irrational) Œ≤. All onsite energies are zero, except at the location of two balanced gain and loss impurities whose
onsite energies are periodically modulated in time. As
in the static analog of this lattice discussed in [33, 34],
these impurities are placed symmetrically in the lattice,
i.e. for a system with N lattice sites, the impurities
are placed at sites m0 and mÃÑ0 = N ‚àí m0 + 1. The
static model discussed in Ref. [33, 34] can be recovered
by setting œâ = 0. The imaginary-energy defects represent gain and loss sites when the magnitudes of their
coefficients are positive and negative, respectively. The
presence of these defects causes the Hamiltonian to be
non-Hermitian.
Equation 2 could be implemented experimentally
structures of coupled optical waveguides. In these systems, the tunneling strengths can be tuned by varying the
spacing of the waveguides (as in [20, 24], for example),
which would allow for the implementation of the static
component of the Hamiltonian H0 . Gain and loss have
been widely implemented in photonic waveguide systems
by using, for example, complex indices of refraction [19‚Äì
25] or by modulating the shape of certain waveguides
[25, 26]. Spatially modulating the gain and loss would
realize the time-varying part of the Hamiltonian V (t).
In some implementations, it may even be unnecessary to
include gain; adding a background loss term to Equation

are given by |œàŒ± (t)i = e‚àíiŒ± t |œÜŒ± (t)i with |œÜŒ± (t)i =
|œÜŒ± (t + T )i. (We work in units where ~ = 1.) Œ± and
|œÜŒ± (t)i are termed the Floquet quasienergies and Floquet modes, respectively. As the form of this solution
suggests, quasienergies must be real in order to conserve
probability. To solve this equation, we define the Floquet
Hamiltonian
HF = H(t) ‚àí i

d

dt

(4)

which satisfies
HF |œÜŒ± (t)i = Œ± |œÜŒ± (t)i .

(5)

The Floquet Hamiltonian can be rewritten in the frequency domain as
q,r
Hn,m
= ‚àíJ(1 + Œª cos(2œÄŒ≤n + Œ¶))Œ¥q,r (Œ¥n,m+1 ‚àí Œ¥n,m‚àí1 )

‚àíiqœâŒ¥n,m Œ¥q,r + i Œ¥m,n (Œ¥n,m0 ‚àí Œ¥n,mÃÑ0 )(Œ¥q,r+1 + Œ¥q,r‚àí1 ),
2
(6)

where m, n are site indices and q, r are Floquet band
indices, sometimes called ‚Äúphoton sectors.‚Äù These photon sectors arise because Œ± and |œÜŒ± (t)i are not uniquely
defined: if Œ± is a Floquet quasienergy, then so is Œ±,q =
Œ± + qœâ for any integer q. The Floquet mode corresponding to Œ±,q is |œÜŒ±,q (t)i = eiqtœâ |œÜŒ± (t)i. Therefore, the
eigenvalues of Eq. 6 can be labeled Œ±,q to account for
the ambiguity in their definition. The eigenvectors are
the Floquet modes translated to the extended Hilbert
space F = H ‚äó LT , where H is the state space of the
system and LT is the space of square-integrable periodic functions with period T = 2œÄ/œâ[57‚Äì59]. In F, the
Floquet modes are written as |œÜŒ±,q ii and have an innerRT
product defined by hhœÜŒ±,q |œÜŒ≤,r ii = T1 0 hœÜŒ±,q |œÜŒ≤,r i dt =
Œ¥Œ±,Œ≤ Œ¥q,r . When the quasienergies are real, the magnitude

3
of the full time-averaged Floquet state (written in Fspace) |hhœàŒ±,q |œàŒ±,r ii|2 follows easily from these eigenvectors, since |hhœàŒ±,q |œàŒ±,q ii|2 = |hhœÜŒ±,q |œÜŒ±,q ii|2 for real Œ±,q .
Therefore, by diagonalizing H, we can obtain the Floquet quasienergies and, when the quasienergies are real,
the magnitudes of the time-averaged Floquet states.
Because the Floquet quasienergies are periodic modulo
œâ, all Floquet quasienergies and states can be obtained by
considering only the first Floquet-Brillouin zone (otherwise known as the first photon sector), defined as the set
of the N lowest-magnitude quasienergies. To numerically
compute the Floquet quasienergies and time-averaged
states, a cutoff index Nf is chosen so that p, q ‚â§ Nf
p,q
and Hn,m
is a N (2Nf + 1) √ó N (2Nf + 1)-dimensional
matrix. Numerical errors arise in the highest-magnitude
FBZs, and so Nf must be large enough to avoid introducing errors into the first FBZ. For the parameters discussed in this work, Nf = 20 is sufficient to approximate the first Floquet-Brillouin zone eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of an infinite-dimensional matrix. (In other
words, the first FBZ quasienergies and modes do not
change as NF is increased further.) Again, the presence of imaginary-energy defects causes the Hamiltonian
to be non-Hermitian (as is evident from the matrix representation of Eq. 6). Furthermore, because of the periodicity of the tunneling elements, H0 is not in general parity-symmetric (P H0 P ‚àí1 6= H0 ), and so the system as a whole does not possess possess P T symmetry
(P T H(t)(P T )‚àí1 6= H). Nevertheless, this system does
have a fully real quasienergy spectrum as long as Œ≥ is below some threshold. An example of a configuration with
a real quasienergy spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. Because
the lattice does not possess P T symmetry or a Hermitian Hamiltonian, we show in Section III that another
physical condition ensures the reality of the quasienergy
spectrum.

III.

REALITY OF THE SPECTRUM
A.

Generalized P T symmetry

tees that the energies are either real or come in complexconjugate pairs, and so P T symmetry is simply a special
case of a broader phenomenon. This framework can be
extended to the Floquet formalism by requiring that A
commute with HF rather than the original Hamiltonian,
[HF , A] = 0, since Eq. 5 takes the place of the characteristic equation for static systems. Likewise, condition (3)
is replaced by the requirement that the instantanteous
eigenvalues of A have unit modulus. For the system defined in Eq. 2, A can be defined as
AH(t)A‚àí1 = H(t),
A = SDT

where S is a linear operator representing sublattice symmetry
San S ‚àí1 = (‚àí1)n an ,

(8)

D is a linear operator representing charge-conjugation
Dan D‚àí1 = a‚Ä†n ,

(9)

and T is an antilinear operator representing time-reversal
T iT ‚àí 1 = ‚àíi,
d
d
T ( )T ‚àí1 = ‚àí( )T.
dt
dt

(10)

Therefore,
SH(t)S ‚àí1 = ‚àíH(t)‚àó
DH(t)D‚àí1 = ‚àíH(t)
T H(t)T ‚àí1 = H(t)‚àó .

(11)

Therefore, A is antiunitary and has [HF , A] = 0 as required.
We now extend the proof given in Ref. [18] to the Floquet formalism. We first assume that the instantaneous
eigenstates of HF (|œÜŒ± (t)i) are also instantaneous eigenstates of A. By condition (3), the instantaneous eigenvalue equation at each time t,
A |œÜŒ± (t)i = Œª(t) |œÜŒ± (t)i ,

Because the Hamiltonian defined in Eq. 2 is neither
Hermitian nor P T -symmetric, another condition must
guarantee the reality of the quasienergy spectrum. We
consider a symmetry of the Hamiltonian given by an
operator A and show that this symmetry guarantees
that quasienergies are either real or come in complexconjugate pairs, just like P T symmetry in other systems.
Ref. [18] shows that, in the context of static systems, P T
symmetry guarantees that energy eigenvalues are either
real or come in complex-conjugate pairs. But, this proof
holds for any operator A obeying three conditions: (1)
A commutes with the system‚Äôs Hamiltonian, (2) A is
antilinear, and (3) the eigenvalues of A have unit modulus. Antiunitary operators obey conditions (2) and (3) by
definition. Therefore, for static systems, any antiunitary
operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian guaran-

(7)

(12)

is solved by an eigenvalue of the form Œª(t) = eiŒ∏(t) for
some real Œ∏(t). Applying HF to both sides of this equation, we have
HF A |œÜŒ± (t)i = HF eiŒ∏(t) |œÜŒ± (t)i
= eiŒ∏(t) HF |œÜŒ± (t)i
= eiŒ∏(t) Œ± |œÜŒ± (t)i

(13)

But, [HF , A] = 0, and so
HF A |œÜŒ± (t)i = AHF |œÜŒ± (t)i
= A |œÜŒ± (t)i
= ‚àó A |œÜŒ± (t)i
= ‚àó eiŒ∏(t) |œÜŒ± (t)i .

time-averaged, first Floquet-Brillouin zone mid-gap ( = 0) mode corresponding to the spectrum in (a) with Œ¶ = 0. This
mode is localized to the first photon sector, and so only that sector is shown.

Combining Eqs. 13 and 14, we see that  = ‚àó . However, we assumed that the instantaneous eigenstates of
HF were also instantaneous eigenstates of A, which is
not necessarily guaranteed by the commutation of HF
and A, since A is antilinear. Without this assumption,
Eqs. 12-14 do not hold, and so the quasienergies are not
guaranteed to be real. In this case, for each quasienergy
and Floquet mode pair  and |œÜŒ± (t)i, there exists a corresponding A-conjugated pair ‚àó and A |œÜŒ± (t)i.
Therefore, as with P T symmetry, we say that A symmetry is unbroken when the instantaneous eigenstates of
the Floquet Hamiltonian are simultaneous eigenstates of
A. As shown above, unbroken A symmetry guarantees
that the quasienergies are real. When A symmetry is
broken, the Floquet modes are no longer instantaneous
eigenstates of A, and quasienergies occur in complexconjugate pairs.
For the Hamiltonian defined in Eq. 2, A is as defined
in Eq. 7 and A =
6 P T . But, A also obeys the definition of
a generalized P T symmetry given in Ref. [52] for static
systems, once again with HF taking the place of the ordinary static Hamiltonian and the Floquet modes taking
the place of the Hamiltonian‚Äôs eigenstates. Therefore, we
say that this system possesses a generalized P T symmetry. It should also be noted that A is a symmetry of the
static version of this lattice H0 . So, the reality of the
static lattice‚Äôs energy spectra (Refs. [33, 34]) can also be
described in terms of the preservation of A symmetry.
Given that A is the symmetry of the static analog
of our system (which is still non-Hermitian), one might
also wonder whether A could be a symmetry of a nonHermitian diagonal AAH model. Ref. [33] proposed a
non-Hermitian generalization of the AAH model given
by

(15)
This system does not possess A symmetry because the
addition of the real onsite energy does not conserve S
symmetry.

Numerical results

We numerically compute the Floquet quasienergies of
the generalized off-diagonal AAH system defined in Eq. 2
to obtain a system with a fully real Floquet quasienergy
spectrum, which corresponds to the preservation of A
symmetry, and Floquet topological phase. We first consider models with rational Œ≤ of the form q/p, so that
hopping elements are spatially periodic. Analogous to
the static version of the lattice H0 (discussed in Refs.
[33, 34]), the spectrum has p bands within each Floquet
Brillouin zone. When mid-gap modes are present, they
are localized to the edges of the lattice. Fig. 1 provides
an example quasienergy spectrum and mid-gap mode for
Œ≤ = 1/2. This system has fully real quasienergies, while
the static analog has complex energy eigenvalues for any
nonzero Œ≥.
In the static case, the reality of the spectrum depends
strongly on the number of lattice sites and on the placement of the defects: a real energy spectrum may only
be obtained when defect location m0 obeys m0 = 0 mod
p and lattice size N obeys N + 1 = 0 mod p. When
these conditions are not met, A symmetry is broken and
the spectrum is complex for all Œ≥. If Œ≥ is decreased,
the imaginary parts of the spectrum decrease proportionally, but the spectrum is never fully real for nonzero Œ≥.
When these conditions are met, the energy spectrum is
fully real for Œ≥ below some critical value Œ≥c , and complex quasienergies (in complex-conjugate pairs) appear
for Œ≥ > Œ≥c . Thus, Œ≥c represents a phase transition between A-broken and A-unbroken symmetry regions. The
value of Œ≥c also depends on m0 , Œ¶, Œ≤ and Œª. Ref. [34]
explains the requirements on m0 and N for the static
system in terms of a ‚Äúhidden symmetry‚Äù of the system:
when both m0 = 0 mod p and N + 1 = 0 mod p are
obeyed, the absolute values of the eigenstates are spatially symmetric at sites of the lattice k obeying k = 0
mod p. When the absolute values of the eigenstates are
symmetric at these sites, the first order perturbations to
the energies of the system introduced by the imaginaryenergy defects vanish, which means that the energy spectrum is real for Œ≥ below Œ≥c .
In contrast, our driven model has an unbroken A-

symmetric phase for all choices of m0 and N , as exemplified in Figs. 1 and 2. As in the static model, the lattice
has a phase of unbroken symmetry for Œ≥ below some critical value Œ≥c . It should be noted that Œ≥c truly represents
a phase transition between the A-symmetry broken and
unbroken regions: our numerical calculations show that
for Œ≥ ‚â§ Œ≥c , the spectrum is real within numerical er0
ror and
for Œ≥ > Œ≥c complex quasienergy eigenvalues are 16
present in the spectrum. For Œ≥ > Œ≥c in the driven model, 14
the entire energy spectrum does not generally become 12
complex all at once: at high frequencies (on the order of
œâ = 2œÄ for the lattices discussed in this work), the high- 10
est magnitude quasienergies tend to acquire imaginary 8
parts2 before the other quasienergies, since the coupling 6
between quasienergy
is given

terms.

Again, however, a real quasienergy
may be obtained for any choice of m0 as long as Œ≥ is below the
critical value for a given set of parameters.
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3(b)-(c), Œ≥c seems to exhibit a
repeating pattern across m0 : roughly, when the defects
are placed sufficiently far from the edges of the lattice
and from each other (i.e. m0 is not too close to 1 or to
N/2), Œ≥c follows a repeating pattern with the same periodicity of the lattice. For example, consider two configurations of a lattice with the parameters in Fig. 3, one with
defect location m0 (with the second defect located symmetrically at mÃÑ0 ) and the other with defect location m00
(with the second defect located symmetrically at mÃÑ0 0 ). If
m00 = m0 mod 7, Fig. 3 shows that Œ≥c for these to configurations are approximately equal to each other across all
Œ¶. However, we emphasize that the values of Œ≥c for these
two configurations are not exactly equal and but differ
by 10‚àí4 or less. Decreasing œâ causes this correlation to
weaken and eventually to disappear, as shown in Fig. 3.
This pattern occurs based on the tunneling elements
that connect the defects to the rest of the lattice. If the
set of four tunneling elements that connect the two defects to the rest of the lattice in the m0 configuration is
the same as the set of four tunneling elements that connect the defects to the rest of the lattice in the m00 configuration, Œ≥c will be approximately equal for these two
lattices. This occurs, for example, under the condition
mentioned above (m00 = m0 mod 7) and when m0 = 6

mod 7 with m00 = 8 mod 7. It should be noted that
only the set of four tunneling elements connecting the
two defects to the rest of the lattice matters, not which
tunneling elements connect which defect. (For example,
for the second choice of m0 and m00 discussed above, the
first defect (energy ‚àíiŒ≥ cos(œât)) for the m0 configuration
will be connected to the lattice by the same tunneling
elements as the second defect (energy ‚àíiŒ≥ cos(œât)) for
the m0 configuration and vice versa.) This is because
complex-conjugating the Floquet Hamiltonian (Eq. 6) reverses the locations of the defects but has no effect on the
quasienergies, since the quasienergies come in complexconjugate pairs as shown in the previous subsection. As
a result, Fig. 3(b)-(c) exhibit both a pattern that repeats
with the periodicity of the lattice (every 7 sites) and another symmetry about m0 = 0 mod 7. These results
hold for all other rational Œ≤ with the same dependence
on the tunneling elements. Why the tunneling elements
lead to this pattern is an area for future investigation.
Neither the high frequency expansion nor other perturbative methods (such as Ref. [60]) lead to a Hamiltonian
where, once the conditions on m0 and m00 are obeyed, the
quasienergies of these configurations are exactly the same
and differences between them may be treated perturbatively. Again, defect placement near the edges of the
lattice does not obey this pattern, and defect placements
on the outermost sites give the largest values of Œ≥c . The
reason for this is evident from the analysis of the rotating
wave approximation shown in the next section.
Now, we consider systems where Œ≤ is irrational. In this
case, the tunneling parameters are only quasi-periodic
rather than periodic. In the static analog, the eigenstate symmetry discussed in Ref. [34] is violated and it is
therefore impossible to obtain a real energy spectrum. In
contrast, we find that once again the periodically driven
system defined in Eq. 2 possesses a phase of unbroken A
symmetry for all choices of m0 and N . When Œ≥ < Œ≥c ,
the quasienergy spectra for these configurations are fully
real and possess a fractional number of bands. Fig. 4 provides an example of this. Unlike systems with rational
Œ≤, though, Œ≥c shows no pattern across m0 because the
tunneling elements never repeat. It should also be noted
that, as in the time-independent, Hermitian system of

FIG. 3: A symmetry-breaking threshold Œ≥c for Œ≤ = 1/7,

Ref. [55], the mid-gap modes are localized to the edges of
the lattice.
As discussed above, the quasienergy eigenvalues for
both the periodic and the quasiperiodic models depend
on driving frequency. For any œâ, real parts of the first
Floquet Brillouin zone quasienergies fall between ‚àíœâ/2
and œâ/2. Increasing œâ increases Œ≥c for a given set of parameters, but there is no nonzero œâ for which Œ≥c = 0, as
exemplified in Fig. 3. So, changing œâ also leads to a phase
transition between A broken and unbroken phases, i.e.
the imaginary parts of the spectrum are exponentially
suppressed when œâ is higher than some critical value
œâc . This behavior can be explained in the context of the
high frequency approximation shown in Section III C: at
high frequencies the Hamiltonian takes on an effective
Hermitian form, and non-Hermitian higher-order terms
carry greater weight as frequency is decreased. At sufficiently high frequencies, the quasienergies remain constant as œâ is increased further and agree closely with the
zeroth order term in the high-frequency expansion shown
in Section III C. The strengths of imaginary parts of the
quasienergy spectrum also depend on œâ: in general, once
œâ is decreased below œâc , the magnitudes of the imaginary

C.

High frequency expansion

We have shown that increasing driving frequency œâ
can cause a phase transition from a broken to unbroken
symmetry phase. In order to explain this behavior, we
use the Floquet-Magnus expansion and the rotating reference frame approximation discussed in Refs. [59, 61] to
show that at sufficiently high frequencies, the lattice of
Eq. 2 takes on an effective Hermitian form.
In the laboratory frame, the Floquet operator U is defined by
U = T e‚àíi

RT
0

H(t)dt

,

(16)

where T is the time-ordering operator, and obeys
U |œÜŒ± (0)i = e‚àíit |œÜŒ± (0)i. Transformation to the rotating reference
frame is given by the unitary operator
Rt
0
0
S(t) = T e‚àíi 0 V (t )dt . Then, the Floquet operator
in
R
‚àíi 0T Hr (t)dt
the rotating frame takes the form Ur = T e
,
where Hr (t) = S(t)‚Ä† H0 S(t). In the high frequency limit,
the Hr (t) takes the effective time-independent form
(0)

Heff = Heff +

1 (2)
1 (1)
H + 2 Heff + ...
œâ eff
œâ

(17)

and so Ur is simply U = e‚àíiHeff T and the quasienergies
are given by the eigenvalues of Heff . [61]. To zeroth
RT
(0)
order, we have Heff ‚âà Heff = T1 0 Hr (t)dt. For our
system, V (t) commutes with itself at different times, and
so Hr (t) takes the simple form
Hr (t) =

Since Hr (t) is Hermitian, so is its time average Heff .
Therefore, the quasienergies are real to zeroth order approximation in the high-energy limit.
The precise forms of higher order terms are given
in [61]. First order corrections vanish, and higherorder terms give complex coupling between different sites,
which introduce imaginary parts to the energy spectrum.
The fact that finite-frequency corrections take the form
of coupling terms agrees with the numerical result from
the previous section that defect placements at the edges
yield different Œ≥c than other defect placements, i.e. the
edges of the lattice couple only to other sites in the lattice only on one side, not both sides. We find that at
sufficiently high frequencies the zeroth order approximation is in close agreement with the numerically obtained
spectrum, and so the spectrum is fully real. At smaller
values of œâ, however, the complex higher order terms in
Eq. 17 do not decrease as rapidly as for higher œâ, and
so the spectrum becomes complex. Fig. 3 shows how Œ≥c
changes with œâ. As stated above increasing œâ increases
Œ≥c for a given set of parameters, and Œ≥c is always nonzero.

Micromotion

The majority of our analysis concerns quantities that
appear as averages over many driving periods. We now
consider the exact behavior of the system over an individual period, referred to as ‚Äúmicromotion.‚Äù From Ref. [57],

FIG. 5: Time evolution of a Floquet state over the course of
a period. (a) shows a time-averaged Floquet state. (b)
shows the expectation value of position for the fully
time-dependent Floquet state at each instant of time. The
horizontal dashed line shows the value of hxi for œà(t = 0).
(And, since œà(t = T ) = œà(t = 0), hxi is the same at t = 0
and t = T .) The parameters correspond to those of Fig. 3b,
with Œ≤ = 1/7, N = 48, Œª = 0.5, m0 = 7, Œ¶ = 0, Œ≥ = 3, and
œâ = 2œÄ (T = 1). This state corresponds to the lowest
quasienergy in the zeroth photon sector ( = ‚àí2.57) and is
localized to the two defect sites over the course of the period
(though the magnitude of the state at each site changes over
the course of a period).

q

where n enumerates sites, q enumerates photon sectors,
and |œÜŒ±,q ii is an eigenvector of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the frequency domain (Eq. 6), and Œ± is the
quasienergy eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector,
all as defined in section II.
Given the form of Eq. 19, each Floquet state remains
normalized as long as its corresponding quasienergy is
real. In this case, the factor of e‚àíiŒ± t provides only a
phase factor, and so the absolute value of the state is periodic with the same period as the onsite energies. Similarly, as will be discussed further in Section IV,  = 0
Floquet states remain localized over the entire period. In
fact, we find numerically that their corresponding Floquet modes are localized strongly to the first Floquet
Brillouin zone. (For example, the zero quasienergy, timeaveraged Floquet mode shown in Fig. 1 is localized entirely to the first photon sector within numerical precision. In other words, |œÜŒ±,q ii is nonzero only for q = 0,

and so the full time-dependent Floquet state is static
and is equal within numerical precision to the first photon sector of the time-averaged Floquet state shown in
Fig. 1c.) Other states with real quasienergies, however,
may evolve appreciably over the course of a period. An
example of this evolution is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a
shows a time-averaged Floquet state, and Fig. 5b shows,
at each instant of time, the expectation value of position
for the corresponding fully time-dependent Floquet state.
As Eq. 19 suggests, Floquet states whose corresponding
quasienergy has a nonzero imaginary part do not evolve
periodically over time and do not remain normalized; the
imaginary part of the quasienergy contributes a factor of
exponential growth or decay.

IV.

TOPOLOGICAL MODES IN THE
COMMENSURATE MODEL

Having analyzed the reality of the spectrum, we discuss the appearance of topologically protected modes. As
is exemplified in Fig. 1(a), (c), the combinations of parameters that lead to localized zero modes in the timeindependent case also lead to localized zero (modulo œâ)
modes in the time-dependent case. The Floquet states
corresponding to  = 0 mod œâ are localized to the edges
of the lattice, as shown in Fig. 1(c). For this combination of parameters and a given Œ¶ in the topological
phase, odd values of N lead to a single zero mode corresponding to a Floquet mode localized at one edge of
the lattice. Even values of N lead to two zero modes
when Œ¶ < œÄ/2 or when Œ¶ > 3œÄ/2 corresponding modes
localized at both edges of the lattice. These results correspond perfectly to the topologically protected modes in
the time-independent systems of Refs. [33, 55].
We now demonstrate that these localized modes are
topologically protected and robust to perturbations. The
Floquet Hamiltonian defined in Eqs. 2,4 has the particlehole symmetry
CHF C ‚àí1 = ‚àíHF‚àó ,

(20)

where the particle-hole operator C = DT with D and T
as defined in Eqs. 9-11 (The definitions of C and A are
identical up to a phase shift.) Particle-hole symmetry
guarantees that quasienergies appear in positive-negative
pairs. To show this, we first complex-conjugate the Floquet eigenvalue equation Eq. 5:
‚àó

‚àó

HF‚àó |œÜŒ± (t)i = ‚àóŒ± |œÜŒ± (t)i .
‚àó

‚àó

Acting with C gives CHF‚àó |œÜŒ± (t)i = ‚àíHF C |œÜŒ± (t)i and
‚àó
‚àó
C‚àóŒ± |œÜŒ± (t)i = Œ± C |œÜŒ± (t)i . Therefore,
‚àó

‚àó

HF C |œÜŒ± (t)i = ‚àíŒ± C |œÜŒ± (t)i

(21)

and so for solution to Eq. 5 with quasienergy , there
is a solution with quasienergy ‚àí. Combined with
A symmetry, this guarantees that in the A-broken
phase the quasienergy spectrum has a quartet structure,
(, ‚àó , ‚àí, ‚àí‚àó ). By the arguments of Ref. [8], the particlehole symmetry of the Floquet Hamiltonian guarantees
the topological protection of the zero energy modes described above and that, furthermore, these modes remain
localized over all time.
These modes are, in particular, two-fold degenerate
Floquet Majorana modes. As with the time-independent
systems of Refs. [33, 55], the fermionic operators of Eq. 2
can be decomposed into two species of Majorana operators, resulting in a Hamiltonian analogous to the timeindependent systems. In particular, the Hamiltonian
takes the form of two Kitaev chains plus two oscillating
imaginary-energy terms. As in the static analog, each
Kitaev chain individually supports a Floquet Majorana
mode localized at one or both ends in the topological

phase [33, 55]. Therefore, in the topological phase, the
system as a whole possesses a two-fold degenerate Floquet Majorana mode, which acts as a Floquet analog of
a Dirac edge mode, and furthermore, the combinations
of parameters that lead to doubly degenerate Majorana
bound states in the time-independent system also lead to
Floquet Majorana modes in this lattice. (For example,
when Œ≤ = 1/2, this occurs for |1+ŒªcosŒ¶| > |1‚àíŒªcosŒ¶|. )
Our numerical results confirm this: for example, compare
our Fig. 1 to Figs. 2-3 from Ref. [33].
We can also ascribe to the system a topological invariant by considering the lattice in the absence of defects. (With the defects, the lattice lacks translational
invariance, and so the wavevector k is no longer a good
quantum number.) In this case, a Z2 invariant can be
calculated for each of the Majorana chains, as discussed
further in Refs. [33, 55, 56], and for appropriate choices of
parameters, the Z2 invariant shows that each Majorana
chain is topologically non-trivial and supports a Majorana mode. The introduction of defects adds a coupling
between the two chains, as discussed in Ref. [33] and, as
we have seen in this work, does not destroy the topological edge modes. As in the static analog, the topological
modes remain even with the defect because the defect
does not introduce coupling between unpaired Majorana
operators on the edge of the lattice.
Additionally, because Floquet quasienergies are only
defined mod œâ, not only are  = 0 modes their own
particle-hole conjugates, but so are states with  = ¬±œâ/2,
and therefore Floquet Majorana modes carrying nonzero
quasienergy exist in some systems [7]. Our numerical
calculations show that such modes do not exist in this
model: in order to obtain localized  = ¬±œâ/2 modes, the
p,q
coupling between different frequency sectors of Hn,m
in
Eq. 6 must be sufficiently large in comparison to other energy parameters of the system (J and ~œâ, where, again,
we set ~ = 1). Since this coupling is purely imaginary
(¬±iŒ≥), the spectrum becomes complex, and no purely real
modes with  = ¬±œâ/2 exist.
Thus, we have obtained Floquet topological modes in a
non-Hermitian, quasi-P T -symmetric lattice. We test the
topological stability of the zero-quasienergy states by introducing next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) tunneling to the
Hamiltonian defined in Eq. 2. In analogy with Ref. [55],
we assume the tunneling is site-independent and has
strength t0 . The Hamiltonian of this system is
H = ‚àíJ

For sufficiently small t0 , the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN)
tunneling term is effectively a perturbation. The addition
of this term causes the energies of the Majorana modes to

be lifted from zero, as shown in Fig. 6 (a). However, due
to their topological nature, the modes are still localized
for sufficiently small perturbations. For the combination
of parameters in this Figure, these modes remain localized until the next-nearest neighbor tunneling parameter
is of the same order of magnitude as the nearest-neighbor
hopping, t0 ‚â§ 0.6.
Because the mid-gap modes remain localized in the
presence of local perturbations, they are topologically
stable. This can be understood in analogy with the arguments presented in Ref. [55]. In particular, the addition of next-nearest-neighbor hopping breaks particlehole symmetry, and so the mid-gap quasienergies are not
guaranteed to be zero precisely. However, these states
can be adiabatically connected to the original zero modes,
and so the original localized modes are still present in the
presence of next-nearest-neighbor tunneling.
In conclusion, we have presented a periodically varying, non-Hermitian generalization of the off-diagonal
AAH model. In the topological phase, zero mod œâ

quasienergy modes appear and are protected by particlehole symmetry, making this the first generalized P T symmetric system to exhibit a Floquet topological phase.
We have also shown how the definitions of P T symmetry and generalizations of P T symmetry can be applied
within the Floquet formalism, and that, like in the static
case, the preservation of these symmetries can replace the
requirement of Hermiticity. For our system, transitions
between the symmetry broken and unbroken phases can
be achieved by changing the driving frequencies, as well
as the usual parameters found in static analogs. We hope
that this work will shed light on the intersection between
non-Hermiticity and Floquet topological phases and will
allow for further investigation in this novel area of study.
