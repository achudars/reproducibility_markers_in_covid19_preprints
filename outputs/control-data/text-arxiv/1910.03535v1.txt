Approximate frame representations via iterated
operator systems
Ole Christensen, Marzieh Hasannasab
October 9, 2019
Abstract
It is known that it is a very restrictive condition for a frame {fk }∞
k=1
to have a representation {T n ϕ}∞
n=0 as the orbit of a bounded operator
T under a single generator ϕ ∈ H. In this paper we prove that, on the
other hand, any frame can be approximated arbitrarily well by a suborbit {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 of a bounded operator T . An important new aspect
is that for certain important classes of frames, e.g., frames consisting
of finitely supported vectors in ℓ2 (N), we can be completely explicit
about possible choices of the operator T and the powers α(k), k ∈ N.
A similar approach carried out in L2 (R) leads to an approximation of a
frame using suborbits of two bounded operators. The results are illustrated with an application to Gabor frames generated by a compactly
supported function. The paper is concluded with an appendix which
collects general results about frame representations using multiple orbits of bounded operators.

Introduction

In the recent and very active research area dynamical sampling [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 11],
one of the key issues is to consider frames of the form {T n ϕ}∞
n=0 , where T is a
bounded linear operator on a given Hilbert space H and ϕ ∈ H. Unfortunately,
the class of explicitly known frames with such a representation is very sparse:
except for the Riesz bases, it only contains the Carleson frames introduced in
[1]. Various alternative operator representations can be found in the literature,
but each of these come with its own constraints and limitations. The purpose
of this paper is to show that all of these limitations disappear if we consider
approximate frame representations using suborbits of a bounded operator. Indeed, we prove that any frame {fk }∞
k=1 can be approximated arbitrarily well
in a perturbation theoretic sense by a frame {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 , which shares key
features with the given frame. Appropriate choices of the operator T already
exist in the literature, e.g., the hypercyclic operators; the most important new
1

aspects in the current paper is that we for some important classes of frames,
e.g., frames consisting of finitely supported vectors in ℓ2 (N), also can specify
appropriate choices of the powers α(k), k ∈ N. A generalization to vectors that
are not finitely supported but with coordinates “decaying sufficiently fast” is
presented as well. We also treat the case of frames consisting of compactly
supported functions in L2 (R), which for technical reasons leads to an approximation using suborbits of two bounded operators rather than one. The results
are illustrated with an application to Gabor frames generated by a compactly
supported function. Since the idea of using multiple suborbits is not treated
detailed in the existing literature, the paper is concluded with an appendix,
which discusses various frame representations using multiple suborbits and the
constraints under which the results are applicable.
The paper is organized as follows. In the rest of this section we set the stage
by discussing the known results and limitations concerning represesentations
of frames as an orbit of a bounded operator. The results about approximate
frame representations are in Section 2.
The following result collects some of the results from the literature about
various operator representations of frames. In the entire paper we let H denote
an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space. Recall that a frame {fk }∞
k=1
is said to have infinite excess if there exists an infinite subfamily {fk }k∈I such
that {fk }k∈N\I is a frame; it has finite excess if it consists of a Riesz basis and
a finite number of vectors.
Theorem 1.1 Let {fk }∞
k=1 be a frame for H. Then the following hold.
(i) [8, 10] Assume that {fk }∞
k=1 is overcomplete and has a representation
n
∞
for
a
bounded operator T : H → H. Then {fk }∞
{fk }∞
=
{T
ϕ}
n=0
k=1
k=1
is linearly independent, has infinite excess, and fk → 0 as k → ∞.
(ii) [16] Assume that {fk }∞
k=1 is linearly independent. Then, given any a >
1, there exists a bounded linear operator T : H → H with kT k = a and
α(k)
∞
f1 }∞
a sequence {α(k)}∞
k=1 .
k=1 ⊂ N0 such that {fk }k=1 = {T
It is worth noticing that the conditions in Theorem 1.1(i) are only necessary
but not sufficient for the availability of a representation of a frame as an
orbit of a bounded operator. Various characterizations of frames with such
a representation can be found in [11] and [10]. A generalization of Theorem
1.1(ii) to Banach spaces appeared in [12].
The proof of Theorem 1.1(ii) is given in terms of a procedure and is not easy
to implement. Our results in Section 2 are indeed inspired by Theorem 1.1(ii)
and the desire to be more explicit about the operator T and the sequence
{α(k)}∞
k=1 ⊂ N0 . Note that the result in Theorem 1.1(ii) actually does not
need the frame property. On the other hand, in the current context the linear
independency is indispensable:
2

Proposition 1.2 Assume that {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 spans an infinite-dimensional space
and that α(k) 6= α(ℓ) for k 6= ℓ. Then {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 is linearly independent.
Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume that the vectors {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1
α(N )
are ordered such that the sequence {α(k)}∞
is
increasing.
Now,
if
T
ϕ
∈
k=1
N −1
α(k)
span{T
ϕ}k=1 for some N ≥ 2, then the vector space
V := span{ϕ, T ϕ, . . . , T α(N )−1 ϕ}
is invariant under the operator T and hence {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 only spans a finitedimensional space.

Note that Theorem 1.1(i) implies that the standard frames in harmonic
analysis, e.g., overcomplete frames of translates, Gabor frames and wavelet
frames, do not have representations as a (full) orbit of a bounded operator.
However, by Theorem 1.1(ii) a representation as a suborbit of a bounded
operator is available under the condition of linear independency, a condition
that is satisfied for all regular frames of translates, Gabor frames along lattices
[17], and a large class of wavelet frames [4].

Approximate frame representations

The existing literature on dynamical sampling deals with exact frame representations. The price to pay for this is that although the class of frames that
can be represented as an orbit of a bounded operator is quite large [10], only
few explicitly given frames of that form are known [1, 8]. In this section we
show that all constraints disappear if we consider approximate frame representations. Indeed, we prove that any frame can be approximated up to any
desired precision using a frame of the form {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 for certain choices of
the operator T, the generator ϕ ∈ H, and the powers α(k) ∈ N. The “approximation quality” is measured in terms of classical conditions from perturbation
theory for frames, which are known to preserve key properties of the frame,
e.g., the excess. For the frames of particular relevance in applications, e.g.,
frames consisting of finitely supported vectors in ℓ2 (N) and compactly supported functions in L2 (R), we can specify exact choices of the powers α(k)
for certain choices of the operator T and the generator ϕ. The general perturbation theoretic approach is outlined in Section 2.1, and the applications to
frames in ℓ2 (N) and L2 (R) are given in Sections 2.2–2.3.

2.1

Perturbation theory and hypercyclic operators

For later convenience we formulate the definition below for a frame with an
arbitrary countable index set I.

Definition 2.1 Let {fk }k∈I be a frame for H. Given any ǫ > 0, a sequence
{fek }k∈I ⊂ H is called an ǫ-approximation of {fk }k∈I if
X

for all finite sequences {ck }.

For sufficiently small values of ǫ, an ǫ-approximation {fek }k∈I of a frame
{fk }k∈I is itself a frame and shares several key properties of the frame, e.g.,
its excess. Furthermore, the synthesis operator and the frame operator for
{fk }k∈I are approximated “well” by the corresponding operators for {fek }k∈I :

Theorem 2.2 Consider a frame {fk }k∈I for H with frame bounds A, B, and
assume that {fek }k∈I ⊂ H is an ǫ-approximation of {fk }k∈I for some ǫ ∈]0, A[.
Then the following hold:
p

(i) {fek }k∈I is a frame with bounds A(1 − Aǫ )2 and B(1 + Bǫ )2 , with the
same excess as {fk }k∈I .

For the applications in Sections 2.2-2.3 it is convenient to apply the following sufficient condition for {fek }k∈I being an ǫ-approximation of {fk }k∈I :

Proposition 2.3 Let {fk }k∈I be a frame for H with lower frame bound A,
and assume that for some ǫ ∈ [0, A[ the sequence {fek }k∈I ⊂ H satisfies that
X
||fk − fek ||2 ≤ ǫ.
(2.2)
k∈I

Then {fek }k∈I is an ǫ-approximation of {fk }k∈I and the conclusions in Theorem
2.2 hold.
The applications in the rest of the section will be based on the following
special case of Proposition 2.3:

Corollary 2.4 Let {fk }∞
k=1 be a frame for H with lower frame bound A: Let
ϕ ∈ H and consider a bounded operator T : H → H. Assume that for a given
ǫ ∈]0, A[, and for any k ∈ N there exists a nonnegative integer α(k) ∈ N0 such
that
kfk − T α(k) ϕk2 ≤

ǫ
.
2k

(2.3)

∞
Then {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 is an ǫ-approximation of {fk }k=1 and the conclusions in
Theorem 2.2 hold.

Corollary 2.4 is inspired by the theory for hypercyclic operators. Recall
that a bounded operator T : H → H is hypercyclic if there exists a vector
ϕ ∈ H such that the orbit {T n ϕ}∞
n=0 is dense in H; any such vector ϕ is
called a hypercyclic vector. We refer to, e.g., [14, 13] for more information on
hypercyclic operators.
Example 2.5 Let T : H → H be a hypercyclic operator with hypercyclic
vector ϕ. Then, for any frame {fk }∞
k=1 for H and any given ǫ > 0 there exists
nonnegative integers α(k), k ∈ N, such that (2.3) holds. Thus, for sufficiently
small values of ǫ, we obtain a frame {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1 with the same excess as the
∞
∞
frame {fk }k=1 and approximating {fk }k=1 in the sense of Definition 2.1. 

5

It is worth emphasizing that in Example 2.5 the obtained frames {T α(k) ϕ}∞
k=1
are only suborbits of the orbit for the operator T. Indeed, the full orbit of a
hypercyclic operator can never be a frame, regardless of the choice of the initial
vector:
Proposition 2.6 Assume that T : H → H is hypercyclic. Then {T n y}∞
n=0
and {(T ∗ )n y}∞
n=0 are not frames for any choice of y ∈ H.
Proof. Let ϕ ∈ H be a hypercyclic vector and consider any y ∈ H\{0}. Then
∗ n
∞
the sequence {hy, T nϕi}∞
n=0 = {h(T ) y, ϕi}n=1 is unbounded, which implies
∗ n
∞
that {||(T ) y||}n=1 is unbounded. Thus, by Theorem 7 in [3] the sequence
{T n y}∞
n=0 is not a frame. Also, considering again any y 6= 0,
∞

|hϕ, (T ) yi| =

|hT n ϕ, yi|2 = ∞,

which implies that {(T ∗ )n y}∞
n=0 is not a frame.



The first example of a hypercyclic operator was given by Rolewicz in [19],
who showed that for any λ > 1 the scaled left-shift operator T (x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . ) :=
λ(x2 , x3 , . . . ) is hypercyclic on ℓ2 (N). More recently a hypercyclic operator has
been constructed on L2 (R):
Example 2.7 Let w : R → R be a continuous decreasing function such that
(
2
if x ≤ 0
w(x) =
1/2 if x ≥ 1.
Then the multiplication operator T : L2 (R) → L2 (R), T f (x) := w(x)f (x) is
hypercyclic, [6]. In particular, reindexing any frame for L2 (R) as {fk }∞
k=1 , we
can approximate the frame arbitrarily well in the sense of Definition 2.1 via
an appropriately chosen suborbit {T α(k) ϕ}∞

k=1 .
Example 2.7 points directly to one of the key issues of the current paper:
indeed, in general we do not have direct access to the numbers α(k), k ∈ N,
such that (2.3) holds, not even for hypercyclic operators. The purpose of the
next section is to show that under very natural conditions on frames in ℓ2 (N)
and L2 (R) we can be very explicit about the choices of appropriate scalars
α(k) for certain choices of the operator T.

2.2

Approximate frame representations in ℓ2 (N).

2
In this section we will consider a frame {fk }∞
k=1 for ℓ (N) consisting of finitely
supported vectors. In the main result we consider a particular operator T and

6

show how to choose a vector ϕ ∈ ℓ2 (N) and powers α(k) such that (2.3) is
satisfied. In order to avoid a too cumbersome formulation of the results we
will apply the following standing assumptions throughout the section:
2
General setup: In the entire section, let {fk }∞
k=1 denote a frame for ℓ (N)
with frame bounds A, B. Fix some λ > 1, and consider the scaled left/rightshift operators on ℓ2 (N), given by

T (x1 , x2 , . . . ) = λ(x2 , x3 , . . . ), U(x1 , x2 , . . . ) = λ−1 (0, x1 , x2 , . . . ).

(2.4)

For appropriately chosen nonnegative integers α(k), k ∈ N, let
ϕ :=

X

U α(n) fn .

(2.5)

n=1

For the case of finitely supported vectors {fk }∞
k=1 the following result specifies how to choose the powers α(k) such that the vector ϕ in (2.5) is well-defined
and (2.3) holds:
Theorem 2.8 Under the conditions in the general setup, assume that {fk }∞
k=1
consists of finitely supported vectors in ℓ2 (N); for k ∈ N, let m(k) denote
the largest index for a nonzero coordinate in fk . Let {α(k)}∞
k=1 be a strictly
increasing sequence of nonnegative integers such that α(1) = 0 and α(k + 1) −
α(k) ≥ m(k) for all k ∈ N. Then, for any k ∈ N,
||fk − T α(k) ϕ||2 ≤

Bλ2 −2[α(k+1)−α(k)]

In particular, choosing the nonnegative integers α(k) such that α(1) = 0 and

the condition (2.3) is satisfied, i.e., the conclusions in Theorem 2.2 hold.
Proof. We have supp fn ⊆ {1, . . . , m(n)} and hence
supp U α(n) fn ⊆ {1 + α(n), . . . , m(n) + α(n)};

thus the assumption α(k + 1) − α(k) ≥ m(k), ∀k ∈ N, implies that the vectors
U α(n) fn , n ∈ N, are perpendicular. Using that {α(k)}∞
k=1 is assumed to be
strictly increasing and that the operator U is a multiple of an isometry, it
follows that

Thus the infinite sequence defining the vector ϕ is convergent. Now, fix any

T α(k)−α(n) fn ; since
α(k) − α(n) ≥ α(n + 1) − α(n) ≥ m(n),
it follows that T α(k) U α(n) fn = 0 for n < k. Thus

λ2 − 1
this leads to the sufficient condition stated in (2.7).



The inequality (2.7) directly express how the powers α(k) are influenced
by the parameter λ, the support lengths m(k), and the desired precision level
determined by the parameter ǫ. In the next result we
√ derive an exact expression
for suitable powers α(k) for the special case λ = 2.

Corollary 2.9 In the setup of Theorem 2.8, let λ = 2, take an upper frame

thus, without any assumption on the numbers m(k), the condition (2.7) is
satisfied if
α(k + 1) − α(k) = k + N + j + 1 + m(k).

(2.12)

Using that α(1) = 0 this yields the formula (2.10). In case m(k) ≤ N +j +1+k
for all k ∈ N, we can discard the numbers m(k) in (2.12), which then leads to
the formula stated in (2.11).

Under certain decay conditions on the coordinates of the vectors fk , we can
remove the assumption of finite support in Theorem 2.8. Specifically, letting
2
{ek }∞
k=1 denote the canonical orthonormal basis for ℓ (N), the jth coordinate of
the vector fk is hej , fk i; we will assume that that there exist constants C, β > 0
such that
|hej , fk i| ≤ Ce−β |j−k|, ∀j, k ∈ N.

(2.13)

Note that in the frame literature this is phrased by saying that the frame
{fk }∞

Theorem 2.10 Under the conditions in the general setup, assume that the

We now consider the two terms in (2.17) separately. For the first first term,
note that since α(k) > α(n) for n = 1, . . . , k − 1, the operator T α(k)−α(n)
removes the first α(k) − α(n) coordinates of the vector the operator is acting

Remark 2.11 The approach taken in this section is not restricted to the
Hilbert space ℓ2 (N). In fact, taking any separable Hilbert space H and an

Clearly, for the particular Hilbert space ℓ2 (Z) an indexing of the orthonormal
basis as {ek }∞
k=1 is not natural. An alternative would be to use the orthogonal
decomposition
ℓ2 (Z) = ℓ2 (. . . , −2, −1, 0) ⊕ ℓ2 (1, 2, 3, . . . ) = ℓ2 (Z− ) ⊕ ℓ2 (Z+ )
and then apply the above methods to each of the spaces ℓ2 (Z− ) and ℓ2 (Z+ );
that would then lead to an approximation of a given frame for ℓ2 (Z) using a
union of two suborbits of appropriately chosen operators T1 , T2 . We will not
go into details with such constructions here but just notice that they would
follow the line of the approach we take in the next section for the Hilbert space
L2 (R).

2.3

Approximate frame representations in L2 (R).

The key reason that makes the approach in Section 2.2 work is that the shift
operator T in (2.4) removes the first coordinate in a given vector in ℓ2 (N).
Thus, the method can not directly be generalized to the shift operator on
L2 (R). For L2 (R) we could alternatively apply the procedure outlined in Remark 2.11, but again the indexing of an orthonormal basis for L2 (R) as {ek }∞
k=1
might not appear natural. In this section we will outline an approach that is
more similar to what we did in Section 2.2. In the entire section we will use
the following setup:
2
General setup: Consider a frame {fk }∞
k=1 for L (R) consisting of compactly
supported functions and with a common upper bound on the length of the
support, see (2.24) below. Let {gk }∞
k=1 denote the collections of functions from
∞
{fk }k=1 that are supported within [0, ∞[, and denote the remaining functions
by {hk }∞
k=1 ; note that it is a consequence of the frame condition that the
∞
families {gk }∞
k=1 and {hk }k=1 indeed are infinite. Choose for k ∈ N the scalars
a(k), b(k), c(k), d(k) ∈ R such that

supp gk ⊆ [a(k), b(k)], supp hk ⊆ [c(k), d(k)].

(2.23)

L := sup (b(k) − a(k), d(k) − c(k)) < ∞.

(2.24)

Assume that
k∈N

12

Fix some λ > 1, and define the following truncated and scaled translation
operators on L2 (R):
U1 f (x) = λ−1 f (x − 1),
U2 f (x) = λ−1 f (x + 1),

T1 f (x) = λf (x + 1)χ[0,∞[ (x)
T2 f (x) = λf (x − 1)χ]−∞,L](x)

(2.25)
(2.26)

∞
Finally, choose increasing sequences {α(k)}∞
k=1 , {γ(k)}k=1 of positive numbers
such that α(k + 1) − α(k) ≥ b(k) and γ(k + 1) − γ(k) ≥ L − c(k) for all k ∈ N,

the vectors ϕ1 and ϕ2 are well-defined. We will now show how the frame

k=1 = {gk }k=1 ∪ {hk }k=1 can be approximated using suborbits of the two

Proof. The proof follows the lines of the proof of Theorem 2.8, so we only
sketch it. We have already argued that the vectors ϕ1 and ϕ2 are well-defined.
α(k) α(k)
Now, fixing k ∈ N, we have T1 U1 gk = gk . Also, for n < k, α(k) − α(n) ≥
α(k) α(n)
α(k)−α(n)
α(n + 1) − α(n) ≥ b(n); it follows that then T1 U1 gn = T1
gn = 0.
Now exactly the same argument as in (2.9) yields the conclusion in (2.28).
The proof of (2.31) is similar.

We will now show explicitly how Theorem 2.12 can be applied to Gabor
frames. Recall that a Gabor frame is a frame for L2 (R) having the form
{Emb Tna g}m,n∈Z := {e2πibx g(x − na)}m,n∈Z for a fixed choice of a function
g ∈ L2 (R) and some a, b > 0. In order to apply Theorem 2.12 we only need
to assume that g is compactly supported. Furthermore, for special choices of
the involved parameters we can be completely explicit about how to choose
suitable powers α(k) and γ(k) in Theorem 2.12:
Example 2.13 Consider a Gabor frame {Emb Tna g}m,n∈Z and assume that
supp g ⊆ [0, C] for some C ∈ R. Choose the sequence {gk }∞
k=1 to consist of only
the positive translates {Emb Tna g}m∈Z,n∈N0 . Furthermore, we order {gk }∞
k=1
such that g1 := g and, in general, if gk = Em′ b Tn′ a g for some m′ ∈ Z, n′ ∈ N0 ,
then gk+1 corresponds to one of the following functions:
E(m′ ±1)b Tn′ a g,

Em′ b T(n′ ±1)a g.

In other words, the ordering is chosen such that going from any gk to gk+1 ,
the translation parameter changes by at most a. Thus, we have supp gk+1 ⊆
(supp gk + a) ∪ (supp gk − a) ∪ supp gk . Combined with the fact that all the
functions gk are supported within the positive real axis, this implies that
for each k ∈ N there exists a positive integer ℓk ≤ k such that supp gk ⊆
[(ℓk − 1)a, C + (ℓk − 1)a]. In a similar fashion, we let {hk }∞
k=1 consist of
the subsequence {Emb Tna g}m∈Z,n∈{...,−3,−2,−1} , ordered such that h1 = T−a g
and the translation parameters in hk+1 and hk differ with at most a. Thus
supp hk ⊆ [−rk a, C − rk a] for some
√ rk ∈ N and rk ≤ k.
Now, consider the case λ = 2 and choose the “tolerance” as ǫ = 2−j for
some j ∈ N. Furthermore, choose an upper frame bound of the form B = 2N
for a sufficiently large value of N ∈ N. Then, let α(1) = γ(1) = 0 and define
∞
the sequences {α(k)}∞
k=1 and {γ(k)}k=1 recursively by
α(k + 1) − α(k) = C + (a + 1)k − a + N + j + 2, k ∈ N.
γ(k + 1) − γ(k) = C + (a + 1)k + N + j + 2, k ∈ N.
Explicitly, this gives

α(k) = (k − 1) k

Appendix: Multi-generator representations
In contrast to the rest of the paper, the approximate frame representation in
Theorem 2.12 is using suborbits of two operators rather than just one. There
is no detailed account of frame representations using multiple orbits in the
literature; for this reason we end the paper with a short collection of results
concerning frame representations using multiple orbits.
Theorem 2.14 Let {fk }∞
k=1 be a frame, which is norm-bounded below. Then
there is a finite collection of vectors from {fk }∞
k=1 , to be called ϕ1 , . . . , ϕJ , and
corresponding bounded operators Tj : H → H, such that
{fk }∞
k=1

=

[

{Tjn ϕj }∞
n=0 .

(2.32)

j=1

Note that in contrast with the single-orbit representation in Theorem 1.1(i),
the representation considered in Theorem 2.14 is available for the standard
frames considered in applied harmonic analysis, e.g., the frames of translates,
Gabor frames, wavelet frames, and generalized shift-invariant systems generated by a finite collection of nonzero functions. Note also that while frames
with positive and finite excess never have a representation as an orbit of a
bounded operator, they always have a representation as a finite union of operator orbit after removal of irrelevant zero-vectors:
Corollary 2.15 Let {fk }∞
k=1 be a frame with finite excess and assume that
fk 6= 0 for all k ∈ N. Then {fk }∞
k=1 has a representation as in (2.32).
It is natural to ask how large one has to choose the parameter J in Theorem
2.14, and how J is related to the redundancy and excess of the frame {fk }∞
k=1 .
∞
First, by Theorem 1.1(i) the condition of {fk }k=1 being norm-bounded below
implies that for overcomplete frames we necessarily have J ≥ 2 in Theorem
2.14. Technically, Theorem 2.14 was proved using the Feichtinger Theorem
(an equivalent form of the long-standing Kadison–Singer Conjecture, which
was finally confirmed in [18]) which states that every frame that is normbounded below can be represented as a finite union of Riesz sequences. Thus,
it would be natural to expect that we would have to choose J at least as large
as the minimal number of Riesz sequences in the Feichtinger decomposition.
This turns out not to be true. We will demonstrate this by exhibiting a class
of frames for which we can actually take J = 2, regardless of the number of
Riesz sequences appearing in the Feichtinger decomposition.
15

Example 2.16 Consider any frame that has a representation as a bi-infinite
orbit {T n ϕ}n∈Z for a bounded and bijective operator T : H → H. Then
−1 n −1
{T n ϕ}n∈Z = {T n ϕ}∞
) T ϕ}∞
n=0 ∪ {(T
n=0 ,

(2.33)

i.e., the frame {T n ϕ}n∈Z can be represented as a union of two orbits. Frames
with a representation as a bi-infinite orbit of a bounded operator were characterized in [9]; in particular, the assumptions are satisfied for frames of translates {Tkb ϕ}k∈Z in L2 (R). Such frames can be constructed with arbitrarily
large redundancy (thus forcing a large number J in the Feichtinger decomposition). Indeed, it is well known that the integer-translates {Tk sinc}k∈Z of the
sinc-function forms an ortonormal basis for the Paley-Wiener space
P W := {f ∈ L2 (R) suppfˆ ⊆ [−1/2, 1/2]}.
It follows that for any N ∈ N, the family {Tk/N sinc}k∈Z is an overcomplete
frame for P W consisting of the union of N orthonormal bases. Thus the proof
of Theorem 1.1 (ii) suggests that we must take J ≥ N; however, by (2.33) the
frame can be decomposed as a union of just two operator orbits.

An intermediate step between a representation of a frame as a single orbit
and as in (2.32) would be to consider multiple orbits generated by the same
operator T. The next example shows that in contrast to the case of frames
represented as a single orbit, such frames are not forced to be linearly independent, and they might be norm-bounded below. The example consists
of a construction of two families of vectors, each of which are complete and
satisfy the Bessel condition but not the lower frame condition; however, the
union of the two systems forms a frame that can be represented as a union of
two operator systems, generated by the same operator T but using different
generators.
Example 2.17 Let {ek }∞
k=1 denote an orthonormal basis for H. Our purpose
∞
is to consider the sequence {ek + ek+1 }∞
k=1 ∪ {ek − ek+1 }k=1 and show that
∞
(i) {ek + ek+1}∞
k=1 ∪ {ek − ek+1 }k=1 is linearly dependent, and hence can not
be represented as an orbit of a single operator (bounded or not).
∞
(ii) {ek + ek+1 }∞
k=1 ∪ {ek − ek+1 }k=1 is a frame and can be represented in
2
n
∞
the form ∪j=1 {T ϕj }n=0 for a bounded operator T : H → H and some
ϕ1 , ϕ2 ∈ H;

First, the result in (i) follows immediately from the observation that 0 =
(e1 +e2 )−(e1 −e2 )−(e2 +e3 )−(e2 −e3 ). Hence, the family {ek +ek+1 }∞
k=1 ∪{ek −
can
not
be
represented
as
an
orbit
of
a
single
operator.
To
prove
that
ek+1 }∞
k=1
it can be represented as a union of two operator orbits we note that by Example
16

5.4.6 in [7] the family {ek + ek+1 }∞
k=1 is a complete Bessel sequence, but not a
frame. Considering the bounded linear operator T : H → H defined by T ek :=
n
∞
ek+1 , k ∈ N and letting ϕ1 := e1 + e2 , we have {ek + ek+1 }∞
k=1 = {T ϕ1 }n=0 .
A slight modification of the argument proves that also {ek − ek+1 }∞
k=1 is a
complete Bessel sequence but not a frame; also, with the same operator T and
n
∞
ϕ2 := e1 − e2 , we have {ek − ek+1 }∞
k=1 = {T ϕ2 }n=0 .
To prove the frame property in (ii) it is enough to find a Bessel sequence
leading to perfect reconstruction. By a direct calculation, for any f ∈ H,
f=

k=1 ∪ {ek − ek+1 }k=1 indeed is a frame, with dual


frame { 12 ek }∞
k=1 ∪ { 2 ek }k=1 .

While certain frames with finite excess can be represented using unions
of operator orbits, this possibility disappear if we insist on all orbits being
generated by the same operator:
Proposition 2.18 Consider a frame {fk }∞
k=1 with finite and strictly positive
excess. Then there does not exist a bounded operator T : H → H and a finite
number of generators {ϕj }Jj=1 such that
J

Proof. Let {fk }∞
k=1 be a frame for H with finite excess. Assume that there
is an operator T ∈ B(H) and ϕ1 , . . . , ϕJ ⊂ {fk }∞
k=1 such that (2.34) holds.
Since {fk }∞
