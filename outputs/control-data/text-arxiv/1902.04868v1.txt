ABSTRACT

Aims. We aim to extend the relationship between X-ray luminosity (L x ) and rotation period (Prot ) found for main-sequence FGK
stars and test whether it also holds for early-M dwarfs, especially in the non-saturated regime (L x ∝ P−2
rot ) which corresponds to slow
rotators.
Methods. We use the luminosity coronal activity indicator (L x ) of a sample of 78 early-M dwarfs with masses in the range from 0.3
to 0.75 M⊙ from the HArps-N red Dwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES) radial velocity (RV) programme collected from ROS AT and
XMM-Newton. The determination of the rotation periods (Prot ) was done by analysing time-series of high-resolution spectroscopy of
the Ca ii H & K and Hα activity indicators. Our sample principally covers the slow rotation regime with rotation periods from 15 to
60 days.
Results. Our work extends to the low mass regime the observed trend for more massive stars showing a continuous shift of the L x /Lbol
vs. Prot power-law towards longer rotation period values and includes the determination, in a more accurate way, of the value of the
rotation period at which the saturation occurs (Psat ) for M dwarf stars.
Conclusions. We conclude that the relations between coronal activity and stellar rotation for FGK stars also hold for early-M dwarfs
in the non-saturated regime, indicating that the rotation period is sufficient to determine the ratio L x /Lbol .

1. Introduction
Currently, the search for small, rocky planets with the potential
capability of hosting life has been focused around M dwarf stars.
The Kepler mission has recently shown that terrestrial planets
are more frequent around M dwarfs compared to solar-like FGK

stars (Howard et al. 2012; Dressing & Charbonneau 2013), so in
the last years M dwarfs became more interesting targets for the
search of planets.
Understanding the stellar activity is crucial to correctly interpret the physics of stellar atmospheres and the radial velocity data from ongoing exoplanet search programmes. This
is particularly critical for M dwarfs as they show high stellar activity levels (both chromospheric and coronal emission,
e.g. Kiraga & Stepien 2007) due to their deep convective layers and they are on average more active than solar-like stars (e.g.
Leto et al. 1997; Osten et al. 2005). Therefore we need to analyse very carefully the activity properties of these targets. ThereArticle number, page 1 of 9

fore we make a brief summary regarding the principal characteristics of M dwarfs which directly affect us in our study.
These stars are relatively cool (approx. between 2200 and
4000 K), have masses smaller than ∼ 0.6M⊙ and offer several advantages. First of all, M dwarf stars are the most abundant component of the solar neighbourhood, ∼ 75% of the stars within
10 pc (e.g. Henry et al. 2006; Reid et al. 2002). Moreover, the
contrast planet-star is more favorable: the motion induced by an
Earth mass planet in the habitable zone around a M dwarf star is
of the order of 1 m s−1 (within today capabilities) while the same
planet would induce a motion ∼ 10 cm s−1 around solar-like
star (e.g. Dressing & Charbonneau 2013; Sozzetti et al. 2013;
Howard et al. 2012). Finally, M dwarfs are more likely to host
rocky planetary companions (Bean et al. 2010). From an observational point of view, the chances of finding an Earth-like planet
in the habitable zone of a star increase as the stellar mass and orbital period decrease (Kasting et al. 1993). As a consequence the
small separation and shorter periods make the amplitude of the
variation of RV large, the time scale of variation shorter and,
therefore, the temporal stability of the instrument is less constraining. Of course the habitability is not guaranteed simply
by assessing the distance from the star and several other factors
such as stellar activity, may shift the habitable zone of the star
(Vidotto et al. 2013). Stellar activity describes the various observational consequences of magnetic fields, which appear on the
stellar photosphere, in the chromosphere or in the corona. All
these phenomena affect the circumstellar environment including
planets and we need to develop an optimal strategy to discern
true keplerian signals from activity induced radial velocity (RV)
variations to identify small rocky planets orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarfs.
It is well known that for FGK stars activity and rotation
are linked by the stellar dynamo and both decrease as the
star ages (e.g. Pallavicini et al. 1981; Strassmeier et al. 1990;
Robinson et al. 1990; Stelzer et al. 2012). Despite the increasing interest in M dwarfs, the activity of these stars is far from
being fully understood, even if some studies suggest that the
connection between age, rotation, and activity may also hold in
early M dwarfs (e.g. Delfosse et al. 1998; Pizzolato et al. 2003;
Maldonado et al. 2017).
Magnetic activity in late-type main-sequence stars is an
observable manifestation of the stellar magnetic fields and
causes X-ray coronal emission which is stronger for more
rapidly rotating stars. The generation of surface magnetic
fields in solar-like stars is considered the end result of
a complex dynamo mechanism, whose efficiency depends
on the interaction between differential rotation and convection inside the star (Kosovichev et al. 2013). Therefore,
stellar rotation must play a very important role and numerous studies have searched for relations between several
chromospheric (Hα and Ca ii H & K) (e.g. Noyes et al.
1984; Mohanty & Basri 2003; Suárez Mascareño et al. 2015;
Astudillo-Defru et al. 2017; Newton et al. 2017) and coronal (X-ray) (e.g. Pallavicini et al. 1981; Maggio et al. 1987;
Randich et al. 1996; Pizzolato et al. 2003; Kiraga & Stepien
2007; Wright et al. 2011; Reiners et al. 2014; Wright et al.
2018) magnetic activity indicators and stellar rotation rate. In
a feedback mechanism, magnetic fields are responsible for the
spin-evolution of the star (Matt et al. 2015), and therefore rotation and magnetic fields are intimately linked and play a fundamental role in stellar evolution. Early works have used spectroscopic measurements of stellar rotation (v sin i) with intrinsic
ambiguities related to the unknown inclination angle and radius
of the stars (Pallavicini et al. 1981). Stellar rotation rates are best

derived from the periodic brightness variations induced by cool
star-spots (photometrically measured) which can be directly associated with the rotation period which has been proven more
useful than v sin i (Pizzolato et al. 2003; Wright et al. 2011).
Theory predicts a qualitative change of the dynamo mechanism at the transition into the fully convective regime (spectral type ∼ M4, Stassun et al. 2011). This makes studies of the
rotation dependence of magnetic activity across the M spectral range crucial for understanding fully convective dynamos.
Rotation-activity studies have been presented with different diagnostics for activity, as Hα and X-ray emission. X-ray emission was shown to be more sensitive to low activity levels in M
dwarfs (Stelzer et al. 2013). On the other hand, studies with optical emission lines (Hα, Ca ii H & K) as activity indicators have
been mostly coupled with v sin i as a rotation measure because
both parameters can be obtained from the same set of spectra
(Browning et al. 2010; Reiners et al. 2012). The combination of
Hα data with photometrically measured M star rotation periods
has been studied by West et al. (2015); Newton et al. (2017).
In previous works (e.g. Pizzolato et al. 2003; Stelzer et al.
2016) the dependence between magnetic activity and rotation for
M dwarf stars remained poorly constrained, specially in the nonsaturated regime (slow rotators). Therefore the turn-over point
between the saturated and non-saturated regimes and the slope
of the decaying part of the relation was not well constrained.
Stelzer et al. (2016) studied a sample of 134 bright, nearby M
dwarfs (spectral type K7-M6), where only a total of 26 stars had
X-ray measurements in the archival data bases available at that
time. These 26 stars were divided into three spectral type groups
(K7-M2, M3-M4 and M5-M6). Pizzolato et al. (2003) studied a
sample of 259 solar-type dwarfs in the B − V range 0.5-2.0, all of
them with X-ray counterpart. The sample was divided as a function of the stellar mass (8 groups from 0.22-1.29 M⊙ range) in
order to investigate how the observed spread of X-ray emission
levels depends on the stellar mass and to determine the best-fit
relations between X-ray emission and rotation period for each
mass bin.
Wright et al. (2011) extended the available dataset and presented a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with X-ray luminosities and rotation periods in the mass range 1.16 - 0.09 M⊙ .
Their sample in the M dwarf mass range was well populated
down to low values. Analogously occurs in Reiners et al. (2014)
that used the same sample analyzed in Wright et al. (2011).
Although our sample does not cover the regime in which the
transition to a fully convective interior occurs, we consider that
our sample can still provide useful information to constrain the
coronal emission-rotation relationship for M dwarfs, especially
because we sample the non-saturated regime.
This work aims to test whether the relations between X-ray
luminosity and stellar rotation investigated in literature for mainsequence FGK stars and for pre-main-sequence M stars also hold
for the early-M dwarfs using our sample of 78 M dwarfs from
HADES radial velocity programme. The work is structured as
follows. In Sect. 2 we present the sample of stars used in this
work. Section 3 describes the determination of the rotation periods (Prot ). Section 4 explains in detail how we studied and obtained the coronal activity indicator X-ray luminosity (L x ), the
comparison with the nearby stellar population to know how representative of the solar neighbourhood our M dwarf sample is,
following with the study of rotation period-stellar activity connection in M dwarfs using our M stars sample. Finally, the summary and conclusions are presented in Sect. 5.

2. The stellar sample

4. Coronal activity

Our stellar sample was observed in the framework of the HArpsN red Dwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES, Affer et al. 2016;
Perger et al. 2017) a collaborative effort between the Global Architecture of Planetary Systems project (GAPS, Covino et al.
2013), the Institut de Ciències de l’Espai (ICE/CSIC) and the
Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC). The sample amounts
to 78 late-K/early-M dwarfs and covers an effective temperature
range from 3400 to 3900 K, corresponding to spectral types from
K7.5 to M4V (Fig 1, left panel) and masses from about 0.3 to
0.75 M⊙ (Fig. 1, right panel). We group the stars in bins of 0.5
spectral subclasses, with K7.5 corresponding to -0.5, M0 to 0,
and so on until M4, which is the last sub-type for which we have
stars in our sample.

As said in previous sections, traditionally the most frequently
investigated diagnostics of chromospheric activity are the Ca ii
H & K and the Balmer lines measured from optical spectra. The
Hα line has in general a complex structure, while Ca ii H & K
lines are difficult to be measured in red stars. In order to measure
a stellar activity diagnostic independent of the optical spectra,
we decided to investigate the coronal activity indicator X-ray
luminosity (L x ). L x is emitted from the upper atmosphere and
can be easily determined for nearby M stars.
With the purpose of studying the coronal activity, we collected the information for our sample of 78 M dwarfs from
the main X-ray missions, XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROS AT
(e.g. Truemper 1992; Voges et al. 1999) following this order
of preference. Using The High Energy Astrophysics Science
Archive Research Center (HEASARC) 1 let us find what X-ray
mission observed our selected targets or if they were observed by
more than one mission. In that case, we followed the stablished
preference. Even if ROS AT is older and less sensitive than the
most recent X-ray observatories, it is still the main source of Xray measurements since it covered all the sky. In particular, the
catalogues that provided us X-ray information were the ROS AT
Bright and Faint Source catalogues (BSC and FSC: Voges et al.
1999), the second ROS AT All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalog (2RXS: Boller et al. 2016), the third ROS AT Catalogue of
Nearby Stars (CNS3: Hünsch et al. 1999), the XMM-Newton
XAssist source list (XAssist: Ptak & Griffiths 2003), the XMMNewton Slew Survey Full Source Catalog, v2.0 (XMMSLEW:
Saxton et al. 2008) and the Third XMM-Newton Serendipitous
Source Catalogue (3XMM-DR7: Rosen et al. 2016).
For ROS AT detected sources, we need to apply a count-toflux Conversion Factor (CF) because the X-ray emission is expressed by count rates (CRT) and hardness ratio (HR) quantities.
H−S
The HR is defined through HR = H+S
, denoting by H and S the
counts recorded in the soft (0.1-0.4 keV) and hard (0.5-2.0 keV)
channels of the Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC)
detector. In order to obtain the X-ray flux ( f x ) from the PSPC
detector, an appropriate conversion factor for a coronal spectral
model must be computed (Schmitt et al. 1995):

The stars were selected from the Palomar-Michigan
State University (PMSU) catalogue (Reid et al. 1995),
Lépine & Gaidos (2011) and are targets observed by the
APACHE transit survey (Sozzetti et al. 2013) with a visible
magnitude lower than 12. High-resolution échelle spectra of the
stars were obtained at La Palma observatory (Canary Islands,
Spain) during several observing runs between September
2012 and November 2017 using the HARPS-N instrument
(Cosentino et al. 2012) at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo
(TNG). HARPS-N spectra cover the wavelength range 383-693
nm with a resolving power of R = 115,000 and all the spectra
were automatically reduced using the Data Reduction Software
(DRS Lovis & Pepe 2007). Basic stellar parameters (effective
temperature, spectral type, surface gravity, iron abundance,
mass, radius and luminosity) were computed and published by
Maldonado et al. (2017) as part of the HADES collaboration
using a methodology based on ratios of spectral features
Maldonado et al. (2015). The methodology consists of using
ratios of pseudo-equivalent widths of spectral features as a
temperature diagnostic. A list of calibrators was built for each
of the basic stellar parameters considered (T eff , spectral type,
and metallicity) and the derived temperatures and metallicities
were used together with photometric estimates of mass, radius,
and surface gravity (more details in Maldonado et al. (2015)).

CF = (8.31 + 5.30 · HR) × 10−12 [erg cm−2 count−1 ]

3. Rotation periods
The determination of the rotation periods (Prot ) was done by
analysing time-series high-resolution spectroscopy of the Ca ii
H & K lines and Hα activity indicators and was published in
Suárez Mascareño et al. (2018). The authors studied a fraction
of our original M dwarf sample, composed of 72 stars (out of
a total of 78) providing 33 rotation periods measured from the
spectral indicator modulation as well as 34 periods derived from
the Ca ii H & K - rotational period relationship. The distribution of rotation periods is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that
our Prot values cover the range from 8 to 85 days. This interval
exactly corresponds to a specific region in which planets in habitable zone around low-mass stars could be discovered. In other
words, the period of planets in the habitable zone orbiting earlyM dwarfs coincide with the stellar rotation period (as shown in
Fig. 1 from Newton et al. (2016)).
The vast majority of our studied sample covers the stellar
rotation period range from 15 to 60 days and mass range to 0.3
to 0.75 M⊙ .

The conversion factor depends on the given spectral model
and on the instrument, the details on this conversion procedure
are given by Fleming et al. (1995). Clearly, the conversion needs
some assumptions for the intrinsic source spectrum, but fortunately the conversion factor does not depend sensitively on the
adopted coronal temperature and also the absorption due to the
interstellar material can be neglected due to the closeness of
our stars. For the four cases with no hardness ratio (HR) in
the database it is assumed a HR value of -0.4, corresponding to
the middle activity level star (Schmitt et al. 1995; Huensch et al.
1998; Sanz-Forcada et al. 2011) and then used a fixed conversion
factor value of 6.19 × 10−12 erg cm−2 count−1 .
Combining the X-ray count rate with the conversion factor,
the X-ray flux can be estimated as

low us to use the previous approach with PIMMS due to a lack
of information in the catalogue (e.g. detector/filter). Therefore,
we provide directly the X-ray flux values reported by the corresponding catalogues (see XMM Science Survey Center memo
SSC-LUX TN-0059 for a general description of the technique).
We can estimate a systematic error introduced by the procedure
described above of the order of 20-30%. The XMM-Newton detected sources (G243-30, GJ476, NLTT51676 and TYC2703706-1) where it was not possible to convert the X-ray flux in
the same energy band of ROSAT, were not used in our analysis
for two reasons: not having information on the rotation period or
having a period derived from an activity-rotation relationship.
Once obtained the X-ray flux value available for our targets,
the X-ray luminosity can be derived by
Fig. 2. Distribution of the rotation periods for the stars in our sample.
The red area shows the measured rotation periods and the blue area
corresponds to the derived rotation periods when a direct determination
was not possible.

For XMM-Newton detected sources (G243-30, GJ412A,
GJ476, GJ49, GJ908, GJ9440, NLTT51676 and TYC2703-7061) no conversion factor is needed because the X-ray emission is
given directly on the observed flux with its correspondent error.
Four of XMM-Newton detected sources (GJ49, GJ9440, GJ908
and GJ412A) were collected with 3XMM-DR7 catalogue. Allowing us to calculate for these targets the X-ray flux in the same
energy band used by ROS AT , using the Chandra Proposal Planning Toolkit PIMMS 2 . Assuming a plasma model (Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code, APEC), selecting the corresponding
detector/filter used in the observation and setting the appropriate input (0.2-12 keV, the total energy band used in the 3XMMDR7 processing) and output energy band (0.1-2.4 keV, the total
energy band in the ROS AT channels), the X-ray flux was derived. For the rest of sources detected by XMM-Newton (G24330, GJ476, NLTT51676, TYC2703-706-1) the different XMMNewton catalogues used (XMMSLEW and XAssist) did not al2

where f x corresponds to the X-ray observed flux and d is the
distance of the star. Table 1 presents the 37 out of 78 stars with
X-ray information collected for our M dwarfs sample. The total
uncertainties on the derived luminosities are calculated by error propagation. In Table 1 we also list the ratio L x /Lbol , where
Lbol is the star bolometric luminosity, that is a measure of the
coronal activity independent of the stellar size useful for a generalized analysis of the activity-rotation relation. The bolometric
luminosity of the stars (L⋆ or Lbol ) was calculated following the
Stefan-Boltzmann law:

where σB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.6704 · 10−5
erg cm−2 s−1 K−4 ). The R⋆ and T eff are the radius and effective
temperature of the star, respectively and were computed using
the methodology based on ratios of spectral features described
in Maldonado et al. (2015). The corresponding stellar parameters for our M dwarfs sample were published in Maldonado et al.
(2017).
4.1. Comparison with the nearby stellar population

In order to test how representative is our M dwarf sample of
the solar neighbourhood, we compare its X-ray properties with a
large sample of nearby M stars. The comparison sample is taken
from the NEXXUS database (Schmitt & Liefke 2004) where

only M dwarfs between M0 to M4.5 spectral types were selected
(the same spectral type range of our sample). NEXXUS is a catalogue of all known stars within a distance of 25 pc to the Sun that
are identified as X-ray and/or XUV-emitting stars from ROS AT
data, based on positional coincidence. Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution functions of log L x for the NEXXUS M dwarfs
and for our sample. The comparison shows a clear tendency of
our sample to show higher levels of activity in X-ray emission
with a log L x median value about twice the median value of the
nearby population. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test shows the
significant difference between the two samples with a K-S statistic value D=0.41 and p-value=0.0002. We collected X-ray information close to the 50% of the total sample. Therefore, as a
roughly approximation, we are studying the regime of moderately active M dwarfs and our research for exoplanets may be
made more difficult by the presence of stellar activity.

4.2. Rotation period - activity relationship

In order to study the M star rotation-activity connection, we use
the X-ray data collected in Sect. 4 and the rotation periods determined in the framework of the HADES collaboration and explained in Sect. 3. Merging both quantities, our sample was reduced to 33 stars with both measurements. The final sample is
given in Table 2 (a total of 19 measured Prot from the spectral
indicators) and Table 3 (a total of 14 derived Prot from the Ca ii
H & K - Prot relationship).
The mass range of our sample of M dwarfs (0.3 to 0.75 M⊙ )
is comparable with the M dwarfs mass range of previous studies.
In Fig. 4 we present an update of the activity-rotation relation of
M dwarf stars using the X-ray data extracted from archives and
the rotation periods by Suárez Mascareño et al. (2018), including stars with rotation periods derived from the activity-rotation
relationship that are plotted as open circles (see below). We also
indicate the relation derived by Pizzolato et al. (2003) and their
sample of 21 stars for their lowest mass bin, M = 0.22-0.60 M⊙ .
It must be noted that the derived relation in the saturated regime
by Pizzolato et al. (2003) is dominated by Prot values estimated
from v sin i measurements (therefore only upper limits values for
Prot ) and only two stars are present in the non-saturated regime.
On the other hand, most of our data fill the slow rotation area of
low-mass stars covering the regime poorly populated in previous
studies (e.g. Pizzolato et al. 2003; Stelzer et al. 2016).
In Fig. 4 (left panel), our data show a spread around the best
fit relation by Pizzolato et al. (2003). This spread is more evident in the right panel of Fig. 4 where log L x /Lbol is reported. It
could be due to two possible reasons: i) the mass range studied
by Pizzolato et al. (2003) (M = 0.22-0.60 M⊙ ) is too large and
it should be divided in subgroups; ii) the derived rotational periods are too uncertain and their inclusion produces an artificially
large spread.
On the one hand we therefore excluded from our analysis
the 14 derived Prot values (i.e, those derived from calcium measurements using a Ca ii H & K - Prot relationship) maintaining
only those with a direct measurement of the rotational period.
We note from now that only periods measured from time series
will be included in the analysis. On the other hand we divided
our sample into two T eff groups: 3400 ≤ T eff ≤ 3700 and 3700 ≤
T eff ≤ 3900 K (approximately mass range M = 0.3 − 0.47 M⊙
and M = 0.51 − 0.64 M⊙ , respectively). This leaves us with a
total of 19 M dwarfs in our sample, 11 stars in the 3400-3700 K
range and 8 in the 3700-3900 K range. Indeed, after discarding
stars without a direct rotation period measurement, the correlations show a remarkably smaller dispersion (Fig. 5), indicating
that we have identified the origin of the spread in Fig. 4.

Fig. 5 shows the behaviour of M dwarfs in the non-saturated
regime by dividing our stars into two T eff groups plotted with different colours. We have not enough stars to determine here the
saturated regime level (fast rotators) because almost all the stars
in our sample are placed into the non-saturated regime. We assume the saturation level as described by Pizzolato et al. (2003).
In a more recent work and using a larger sample, Stelzer et al.
(2016) determine a higher saturation level than the one found
by Pizzolato et al. (2003). However, the sample in Stelzer et al.
(2016) is taken from the Kepler Two-Wheel (K2) light curves
and it is likely biased towards bright X-ray M dwarfs which can
be translated into a higher value of the saturation level.

In order to obtain a new parametrization of the X-ray emission vs. rotation relationship for M dwarfs in the non-saturated
regime for the two bins of T eff , the data were fitted in each temperature bin with a fixed power law exponent of -2, leaving the
intercept parameter free to vary. This value follows the well studied and known relation (e.g. Pizzolato et al. 2003; Reiners et al.
2014) for the non-saturated regime, L x ∝ P−2 , indicating that the
rotation period alone determines the X-ray emission. Power-law
functions were fitted to the data,

where log F1 corresponds with the values of log L x and
log L x /Lbol and a0 and a1 are the fit coefficients. In our case we
set the value a1 fixed to -2 and obtained the best two intercept
parameters presented in Table 4.
The obtained best-fit relations between log L x and Prot (Fig.
5, left panel) are very similar for the two T eff bins. Note the complementary behaviour of the log L x /Lbol versus Prot relation (Fig.
5, right panel) where the different loci occupied by the two T eff
groups are more evident. This behaviour is coherent with the extension of Pizzolato et al. (2003) for more massive stars (F to
late-K stars) presented in Fig. 6, being our work an extension to
the low mass regime that follows the observed trend for massive
stars.
Using log L x /Lbol as indicator, for low-mass stars that rotate
very fast the relationship breaks down when X-ray luminosity
reaches the approximately saturated value of log L x /Lbol ∼ −3
(e.g. Vilhu 1984; Pizzolato et al. 2003) independent of the stellar
mass (except for the most massive bin). This saturation level is
reached at rotation periods that increase towards less massive
stars (increasing with decreasing the bolometric luminosity).
On the contrary, if the log L x indicator is considered, the
log L x is a function of rotation period in the non-saturated regime
being independent from stellar mass.
This behaviour, across all spectral types, is clearly seen in
Fig. 6 where we represent the collection of all best-fit relations
found by Pizzolato et al. (2003) in all the mass ranges (F to lateK stars) including the new relations found in this work in the
non-saturated regime for early-M dwarfs. In the left panel our
best-fits are placed in the same range of non-saturated regime of
all spectral types while in the right panel (log L x /Lbol vs. Prot )
the new curve of the M dwarfs is on the right of the curves of
more massive stars.
We have found a continuous shift of the log L x /Lbol vs.
Prot power-law towards longer Prot values extending the up to
now available sample of M dwarf stars to the non-saturated
X-ray emission regime with respect to previous studies (e.g.
Pizzolato et al. 2003; Stelzer et al. 2016; Wright et al. 2011).
Consequently we are able to determine in a more accurate
way than in previous works the value of rotation period at which
the saturation occurs (Psat ) for M dwarf stars. Assuming a defined saturated value for all mass range in log L x /Lbol as -3.3
(except for the most massive bin that, as shown in the right panel
of Fig. 6, does not reach the same saturated value of the less
massive bins) and knowing the mean value of log Lbol (for each
temperature group) it is possible to estimate a better value for the
rotation period Psat,Lx/Lbol for each temperature bin in log L x /Lbol
representation. Then we are able to obtain the correspondence of
saturated rotation period value (Psat,Lx ) in log L x representation.
The rotation period values derived from our sample at which Xray emission reaches the saturation level are presented in Table 5,
as well as the values found in literature for early/mid M dwarfs.
In Fig. 7 we show the rotation period at which the saturation level is reached, Psat , both in L x and L x /Lbol representaArticle number, page 8 of 9

tion, as a function of the different mass ranges used previously
(Fig. 6). The global behaviour of the Psat value along the different masses, in both cases, is to increase towards smaller stellar
masses. Therefore less massive targets will reach the saturated
value at longer rotation periods.

5. Summary and conclusions
The aim of this paper was to test if the known relations in
previous works between activity and stellar rotation for mainsequence FGK stars also hold for our sample of early-M dwarfs.
Computing the coronal activity indicator X-ray luminosity using the available data from ROS AT and XMM-Newton and using the rotation periods determined inside the HADES collaboration we were able to study the relation L x ∝ P−2
rot , that describes the non-saturated regime. We conclude that the relation
is also valid for our targets extending the up to now available
sample of M dwarfs to the non-saturated X-ray emission regime.
Our best-fit relations follow the observed trend for more massive
stars in both representations, L x and L x /Lbol versus Prot which
let us determine in a more accurate way than in previous works
the calculated value at which the rotation period achieves the
saturation. This was possible by knowing the defined value of
log L x /Lbol = −3.3 (Pizzolato et al. 2003) when the stars saturate, the mean value of log Lbol for each temperature group and
considering the coefficients of the activity-rotation relationship
estimated in this work.
We wanted to go one step further and study the age at which
is reached the saturation level in M dwarfs. We used the angular
momentum evolution models for 0.8 M⊙ and 0.3 M⊙ stars presented by Bouvier (2007) in Fig. 4 of that work. Following the
models for slow and fast rotators showed by red solid lines it is
possible an estimation of the age at which the saturation level
is reached. The rotational period is easily converted to angular
velocity by Ω = 2π/Prot and scaled to the Sun (Ω⊙ = 2.87 × 10−6
s−1 ). On the one hand, for our sample in the mass range group
∼ 0.3M⊙ that reaches the saturation at Psat,Lx ∼ 8 days we can
used the 0.3 M⊙ models, finding that the saturation age is from
300 to 400 Myr. On the other hand, for the stars corresponding to those studied by Pizzolato et al. (2003), it is better to use
the models computed for 0.8 M⊙ because of the different mass

range. So, the age at which they reach the saturation level could
be defined before of 300 Myr by using the 0.8 M⊙ models. The
age range depends on the exact path followed by the star during
its rotational evolution.
Finally, the importance of analysing the rotation periodactivity relation using our sample of M dwarfs and concluding
that is also valid for our targets, lies in that our data fill the slow
rotation area. This area exactly corresponds with a specific region in which planets in habitable zone around low-mass stars
could be discovered.
This confirms the big challenge that the stellar activity poses
on our radial velocity survey on discovering planets in early-M
dwarfs and our interest on a good understanding of the stellar
activity.
