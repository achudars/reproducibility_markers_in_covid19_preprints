ABSTRACT
We study the impact of cluster environment on the morphology of a sample of 4304 extended radio
galaxies from Radio Galaxy Zoo. A total of 87% of the sample lies within a projected 15 Mpc of
an optically identified cluster. Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely than other cluster
members to be radio sources, and are also moderately bent. The surface density as a function of
separation from cluster center of non-BCG radio galaxies follows a power law with index 1.10 ± 0.03
out to 10 r500 (∼ 7 Mpc), which is steeper than the corresponding distribution for optically selected
galaxies. Non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent the closer they are to the cluster center.
Within the inner 1.5 r500 (∼ 1 Mpc) of a cluster, non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent in
high-mass clusters than in low-mass clusters. Together, we find that non-BCG sources are statistically
more bent in environments that exert greater ram pressure. We use the orientation of bent radio
galaxies as an indicator of galaxy orbits and find that they are preferentially in radial orbits. Away
from clusters, there is a large population of bent radio galaxies, limiting their use as cluster locators;
however, they are still located within statistically overdense regions. We investigate the asymmetry in
the tail length of sources that have their tails aligned along the radius vector from the cluster center,
and find that the length of the inward-pointing tail is weakly suppressed for sources close to the center
of the cluster.

Radio galaxies exhibit a wide range of morphological
variation, especially those that are members of galaxy
clusters. As radio-emitting jets from the galactic nucleus
expand into the surrounding environment, they interact with the diffuse plasma of the intracluster medium
(ICM). Density variations within the ICM and relative

2

Garon et al.

motion between the radio galaxy and the ICM, for example, can produce distortions in the radio emissions
and more complicated structures.
From simulations, we have some understanding of the
dynamical processes that underlie the interaction between the ICM and the radio jets (e.g. Balsara & Norman 1992; Loken et al. 1995; Heinz et al. 2006; Porter
et al. 2009; Mendygral et al. 2012). In individual galaxy
clusters, we can use observations of radio galaxies to
map shocks, turbulence, and other structures within the
ICM (e.g. Krempec-Krygier & Krygier 1995; Roettiger
et al. 1999; Feretti et al. 2012; Owen et al. 2014; de
Gasperin et al. 2017). However, the more general dependence of radio galaxy structures on the physical characteristics of the ICM remain an open question, one which
case studies cannot answer.
To this end, we require a very large sample of radio
galaxies. By distributing the classification work across
a large number of citizen scientists, the Radio Galaxy
Zoo project1 (RGZ; Banfield et al. 2015) is generating
a catalog of almost 180,000 radio source host identifications. Using an initial portion consisting of 118,090
radio sources, we investigate how we can use the morphology and orientation of the radio emission to probe
the influence of the ICM as a function of its inferred
properties.
In this paper, we address this question from three
main fronts. The first is by investigating how the radio
galaxies are bent by the ICM. As galaxies travel through
the ICM, ram pressure will distort the radio jets (Begelman et al. 1979; Jones & Owen 1979; Jones et al. 2017).
Ram pressure depends on the density of the surrounding medium and the relative velocity between the galaxy
and the ICM, so the amount of bending we observe will
be a function of these quantities. The orientation of the
angle bisector of the opening angle depends on the direction of relative motion between the galaxy and the ICM,
so the second line of investigation is based on mapping
the orbits of radio galaxies by using the bending as a
tracer of galaxy orbits. Finally, the two radio jets of a
single galaxy expand into different parts of the ICM, so
by observing asymmetry in the jets we will characterize
density and pressure gradients in the ICM.
With a large enough sample, we can also reverse the
question: rather than study the influence of the clusters
on radio galaxies, we investigate if one can use radio
galaxies to search for tell-tale signs of nearby clusters.
Previous surveys (O’Brien et al. 2016; Paterno-Mahler
et al. 2017) have used bent radio sources to find clusters.

A cluster was also discovered using a bent radio galaxy
discovered in RGZ (Banfield et al. 2016). We will investigate in this paper how bent radio galaxies can be
used as a statistical indicator of the galaxy overdensities
around them.
In Section 2, we present the catalogs from which we
drew our data. In Section 3, we describe our sample
selection process. In Section 4, we discuss sources and
levels of uncertainty in our bending angle measurements,
and how we correct for that. In Section 5, we report
our specific findings (summarized in Section 5.8). In
Section 6, we discuss the physical interpretation of our
results and potential directions for follow-up research.
Throughout this work we assume a cosmology of H0 =
68 km s−1 Mpc−1 , ΩΛ = 0.685, and Ωm = 0.315 (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2014).
2. DATA

The RGZ catalog is comprised of radio sources that
citizen scientists have matched to infrared host galaxies. The main value of RGZ comes from the matching of associated and possibly disconnected radio source
components, as well as the cross-identification of host
galaxies. The bulk of the radio data in the RGZ catalog
comes from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty
Centimeters survey (FIRST; Becker et al. 1995; White
et al. 1997), and we combine radio galaxy classifications
generated by the citizen scientists with additional data
derived from the radio contours from FIRST, which begin at a level 4 times the local noise. The RGZ catalog
also contains a sample of radio sources from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS; Franzen
et al. 2015), but those sources are not included in this
paper.
The host galaxies to which the radio sources are
matched are identified on W1 band (3.6 µm) images
from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE;
Wright et al. 2010). Each source may or may not have
an IR identification. Those that do have an IR counterpart identified by RGZ consensus usually have a counterpart in the WISE catalog, but those with insufficient
signal-to-noise for inclusion in that catalog may not.
An example of the source as presented to RGZ users
is shown in Figure 1. Radio contours from FIRST are
displayed on top of the IR field from WISE. The RGZ
user also can toggle between FIRST contours and a semitransparent radio intensity map. In this example, the
consensus host galaxy in the IR image is located in the
bridge of radio emission connecting the two outer lobes.
For this paper, sources with IR counterparts were
cross-matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR13
catalog (SDSS; Albareti et al. 2017), providing red-

shift measurements and improved angular resolution
over WISE. We performed the cross-match to the
PhotoPrimary table in SDSS using a 3 arcsec search
radius. For sources that SDSS classified as extended
based on the photometry, we queried the Photoz table
for photometric redshifts (present for 98% of our sample; see also Beck et al. 2016). We furthered queried
the SpecObj table to get spectroscopic redshifts where
available (present for 40% of our sample). We gave
preference to the SDSS spectroscopic redshift where
available; otherwise, we used the SDSS photometric
redshift. The photometric redshifts have larger errors
and the distribution peaks at a higher redshift than the
distribution of spectroscopic redshifts in our data set,
suggesting that sources with only photometric redshifts
will be labeled as background sources more often; however, this should not systematically bias our analysis.
We wrote an automated algorithm to identify double and triple radio sources from the radio contour information and consensus user classifications. A double
source was defined as either having two disjoint radio
components or a single radio component with two radio peaks. A triple source was likewise defined as either
having three disjoint radio components or a single radio component with three radio peaks. Additionally for
triple sources, one of the radio peaks was constrained to
be coincident with the SDSS position, i.e. the SDSS position must lie within the innermost contour containing
one of the peaks.

Figure 2. FIRST image of the example source in Figure 1.
The magenta circle is the position of the host galaxy from
SDSS; the magenta arrows terminate in the two radio peaks
and are used to measure the bending angle; the cyan arrow
is the angle bisector of the opening angle; the green contours
are the radio contour levels; and the red dashed rectangle
marks the bounding box used to measure the angular size.
This source has a bending angle of θ = 47◦ and angular size
of 0.93 arcmin. At redshift z = 0.2447, this corresponds to
220 kpc.

Radio peaks were derived from the FIRST images as
part of the RGZ pipeline. Within each innermost contour in the FIRST image, the pixel with the greatest
flux was defined as a peak. In this way, a single radio
component can have multiple peaks if there is substructure within the radio emission. The majority of sources
in RGZ contain only a single radio peak; after removing
those, as well as sources with more than three radio components (approximately 3% of RGZ), we identified an
initial set of 6207 radio sources (4957 doubles and 1250
triples) for which we could measure the bending angle.
We used the SDSS position to calculate the bending angle by drawing lines from the host through the two radio
peaks (excluding the one coincident with the host in a
triple source). The bending angle is then defined as the
deviation of the two lines from co-linear (e.g. a perfectly
straight source has bending angle 0◦ ). See Figure 2 for
an annotated example.
We used the updated version of the Wen et al. (2012)
cluster catalog (Wen & Han 2015, hereafter WH15) for
the sample of galaxy clusters. This catalog contains
158,103 clusters obtained from SDSS covering a range of
redshifts from 0.02 to 0.8 and includes optically-derived
values for their richness (RL∗,500 ) and radius (r500 ). It
also includes a method of calculating an optical mass
proxy from the cluster richness, which WH15 derived by
fitting to the X-ray- and SZ-derived masses for a subset

4

of the catalog,
log M500 = 1.08 log RL∗,500 − 1.37,

(1)

where M500 is the cluster mass within r500 and RL∗,500
is the cluster richness, defined as the luminosity within
r500 normalized by L∗ .
Wen et al. (2012) identified clusters in SDSS using a friends-of-friends algorithm applied to luminous
galaxies, Mre (z) ≤ −21, where Mre (z) is the evolutioncorrected absolute r-band magnitude. In each cluster candidate, the galaxy with the greatest number of
friends was taken as the temporary center of the cluster, then the most luminous galaxy within 0.5 Mpc and
±0.04(1 + z) of the temporary center was defined as the
BCG. Finally, the position of the BCG was defined to be
the center of the cluster. Wen et al. (2012) also applied
a minimum richness threshold of RL∗,200 ≥ 12, which
corresponds to M200 ∼ 0.6 × 1014 M .
We matched a radio source to a cluster by finding the
nearest cluster located within a projected distance of
15 Mpc from the host galaxy, calculated at the redshift
of the galaxy, and within a redshift range of |∆z| < 0.04,
where ∆z is defined as
∆z =

zgal − zcluster
.
1 + zgal

(2)

We chose the 15 Mpc projected distance as being typical of the distance between clusters, so any galaxy associated with a cluster should be matched within that distance. At higher redshifts the completeness of WH15 decreases, but this fiducial separation is much larger than
the separation within which we expect to observe an
effect due to cluster proximity.
The choice of a redshift range within which to consider a radio galaxy matched to a cluster represented a
trade-off between including as many true cluster radio
galaxies as possible, and simultaneously minimizing the
number of contaminating radio galaxies. The ∆z distribution is shown in Figure 3, within the projected 15 Mpc
threshold. We chose a redshift threshold of |∆z| < 0.04
because there was a clear excess of cluster sources within
that range. This happens to be the same redshift range
criterion used in the generation of the WH15 catalog.
The threshold is marked in Figure 3 with solid vertical
lines. This unavoidably results in accepting some small
number of radio galaxies, estimated at the level of the
dotted horizontal line, which are actually as much as a
comoving ±100 Mpc from their matched cluster.
We discuss the contamination and completeness due
to these thresholds in Section 3.2; however, any contribution from contaminating sources (including ones with
incorrect host identifications) will be uncorrelated with

Figure 3. The distribution of ∆z (defined in Equation 2) in
the RGZ-WH15 15 Mpc positional cross-match, plotted over
the range −0.1 to +0.1. The solid vertical lines are the ∆z
threshold used for matching, and the dotted horizontal line
is the estimated contribution due to background sources.

the cluster parameters we study, so it will merely serve
to lower the reported significance level of our results.
With both projected separation and redshift cuts, we
have 4257 double sources and 1096 triple sources in the
matched sample. In other words, 87% of our sample is
located within a projected 15 Mpc of a cluster.
We calculate the orientation angle of the radio source
relative to the cluster center by measuring the difference
between the angle bisector of the opening angle and the
radial vector to the cluster center. This value ranges
between 0◦ for sources opening parallel to the radial
vector (i.e. bent away from the cluster center) and 180◦
for sources opening anti-parallel to the radial vector (i.e.
bent towards the cluster center).
3. SAMPLE SELECTION

We restricted the sample to sources with at least a 0.65
consensus in the radio component classification from
RGZ to remove sources with ambiguous structure, as
well as non-physical associations between radio lobes
and coincident galaxies. A minimum statistical reliability of 80% was found for the 0.65 consensus limit for
RGZ DR1 (O. I. Wong et al., in prep.). This consensus
value includes the use of classifier weighting and was
calibrated to the classifications performed performed by
the RGZ science team.
No reliability tests were performed for the IR host
identifications, and we did not apply a consensus threshold for those identifications here. As described in Banfield et al. (2015), the host galaxy of a radio source is
identified by a kernel density estimator (KDE) method

based on the clustering of clicks from the RGZ participants. While spectral indices are not available to verify the host galaxy selection, the ambiguity of the host
galaxy candidates is reduced via the combination of 1)
the low-redshift volume; 2) the radio galaxy angular size
selection criteria; and 3) the cross-identification of WISE
and SDSS observations. In Section 4.2, we find that
double sources follow the same trends as triple sources,
suggesting that host identifications even in the absence
of a radio core are statistically as reliable as those with
radio cores; and in Section 6, we find that our results
are generally consistent with previous studies which used
more manual verification of a few tens of radio sources
(e.g. Blanton et al. 2001; Rodman et al. 2019). Such
consistencies suggest that our results are unlikely to be
contaminated by a significant number of misidentified
host galaxies.
Given the 3 arcmin size of RGZ subject fields, we applied a radio source size threshold of 1.5 arcmin to ensure
that sources are wholly contained within the field. We
use the RGZ catalog’s measure of largest angular size,
which is defined as the diagonal across the bounding
box containing the outer (4σ) contour level of the radio
emission. Applying a maximum angular size will preferentially retain large sources at high redshift, which tend
to be more luminous (Kapahi 1985); we do not expect
this to bias our results. We also removed any sources
that intersect the edge of the subject field presented to
RGZ users.
We imposed a bending angle maximum of 135◦ , because above this, a brief visual inspection revealed that
such highly bent angles are probably due to misidentification of the host far from the major axis of radio emission. This excludes the small fraction of true narrowangle tail sources which may be in the sample. With all
of these requirements, the matched sample was reduced
to 3203 double sources and 477 triple sources.
In Section 4.2, we define a “corrected bending angle,”

update the bending angle threshold of 135◦ to refer to
the corrected bending angle. This increases our final
sample to 3742 double sources and 562 triple sources,
of which we match 3235 double sources and 488 triple
sources to clusters within a projected 15 Mpc. The sample size after each cut is summarized in Table 1. The
final sample of 4304 sources are included as supplemental material on the journal website, along with all of the
derived quantities used within this work; see the Appendix for details.
3.1. Spatial distribution of radio galaxies around
clusters
For each source in the matched sample, we take its
projected distance from the center of the cluster (now
calculated at the redshift of the cluster to be more physically meaningful, in contrast to the matching algorithm
in Section 2) and normalize it by the r500 of the cluster, as given in the WH15 catalog. The median r500 in
WH15 is 0.65 Mpc. The histogram of normalized separations is shown in Figure 4. The distribution is bimodal,
with one peak around 10−4 r500 and the other around
10 r500 . The first peak is due to the WH15 definition
of the cluster center, which is defined as the position of
the BCG; because WH15 used Data Releases 8 and 9 of
SDSS, whereas RGZ uses Data Release 13, there is often
a small positional offset (less than 1 arcsec) between the
WH15 and RGZ position of the host galaxy. Given this,
we treat all sources within 0.01 r500 of the cluster center
as being the BCG of their respective cluster and group

them together in our analysis. This corresponds to a
physical separation of only 7 kpc for the median cluster
in our sample, well within the size of a galaxy.
When plotting the number of sources matched to a
cluster per unit area around it, the surface density scales
as a power law. We perform a linear fit to the data in
loglog space between 0.01 and 10 r500 and calculate that
the best fitting power law has index α = −1.10 ± 0.03,
shown as the blue points and solid line in Figure 5. We
compared this result to a sample of 14,214 optically selected galaxies from SDSS. We selected the SDSS sample
by drawing random RA, Dec., and redshift values following the distribution of the RGZ sample and taking the
nearest corresponding galaxy in SDSS. Using the same
cluster-matching algorithm, we matched 13,182 (93%) of
the SDSS galaxies to WH15. Figure 5 shows the surface
density distribution for the optical galaxies in orange,
for which the best fitting power law (dashed line) has
index α = −0.94 ± 0.02.
Both radio and optical distributions follow an approximately 1/r trend, consistent with an isothermal distribution within the cluster. Since a background population would have a flat profile, these distributions are
likely dominated by true cluster galaxies. However,
the power law slope is slightly but statistically significantly steeper for cluster radio galaxies. 271/2209 =
(12.3 ± 1.0)% of non-BCG radio sources within 10 r500
of the nearest cluster are within the innermost r500 of
that cluster, compared to 584/8823 = (6.6 ± 0.3)% of
optically-identified galaxies within 10 r500 . This indi-

cates that extended radio galaxies are a biased population (consistent with Overzier et al. 2003 and references
therein). We believe the cut-off in the power law beyond 10 r500 is due to a combination of the typical size
of a galaxy cluster and when galaxies begin matching to
another nearby cluster, although quantifying that effect
would require a more detailed analysis.
In addition, we find that BCGs are at least 2.5 times
as likely to have extended radio emission as the general
population of cluster galaxies: 546/2755 = (19.8±1.2)%
of the RGZ matches within 10 r500 are BCGs, compared
to only 743/9566 = (7.8 ± 0.4)% of the SDSS matches
within the same separation. This is consistent with previous findings (Best et al. 2007).
3.2. Contamination
Figure 3 shows the distribution of ∆z in the RGZWH15 cross-match. We use this distribution to estimate the contamination and completeness of our sample.
Given our redshift matching criterion of |∆z| < 0.04,
we take the mean number of matches in each |∆z| bin
between 0.04 and 0.1 as the number of contaminating
sources per bin. Between |∆z| = 0 and 0.04, 21.5% of
the matched sources can be attributed to this contamination. Likewise, we take the number of sources that
are above this contamination level in bins with |∆z| between 0.04 and 0.1, where the entire sample is likely from
contamination, as the number of sources that should be
included in our sample but are removed by the redshift
threshold. 1.8% of the cross-matched sources are removed this way, leading to a sample that is at least
98.2% complete.
We estimate the effect of contamination as a function of cluster separation. Assuming that contaminating sources are uniformly distributed on the projected
sky, we calculate the number and fraction of expected
contaminating sources at each cluster separation. The
top plot of Figure 6 shows the distribution of sources
in our sample (solid; the same distribution as Figure 4)
and the number of contaminating sources in each bin
(dashed; note that this is not the cumulative contamination). In our analysis we focus on sources within
1.5 r500 of their nearest cluster, which also corresponds
to approximately the virial radius; the contamination
in the bin at this separation is only 0.01%. A more detailed contamination analysis would include the effect of
galaxies at high separations matching to other neighboring clusters, which we predict contributes to the drop-off
in source count that occurs beyond 10 r500 . However,
we can safely say that the effect of contamination in
the range of separations in which we are interested is
minimal.

4. QUALIFYING THE BENDING ANGLE

4.1. Bending angle uncertainties
Our definition of bending angle is based on the angle between the host galaxy and the peaks in the radio
emission. This is a well-defined and easily measurable,
but still arbitrary definition. The first thing we do is
assess the measurement uncertainties in bending angle
that arise from this definition and the properties of our
data sample.
There are four known sources of potential error in our
measurement. The first is radio component classification
error, which occurs when the radio source could consist
of a chance superposition of unrelated radio components.
We attempted to minimize this with the 0.65 consensus
threshold in the sample selection stage.
The second is astrometry error of the optical host,
including a very small contribution from host misidentifications. The astrometry error typically induces less
than a tenth of a degree of bending, given the angular
size of the sources and the sub-arcsec precision in the
positions of the host galaxies in SDSS. Host misidentification could also contribute an error due to a spurious match between a misidentified host and a cluster
unrelated to the radio source, but as discussed in the
previous section, contamination by these foreground or
background sources will have a negligible effect on our
results.

dashed line is the running root-mean-square difference between bending angle calculated through the radio peaks and
bending angle calculated through the most distant point on
the contours. The RMS difference is not used in the correction; it simply demonstrates the magnitude of the morphology effect on bending. The large increase in RMS for sources
larger than 1.1 arcmin is due to a small number of outliers,
but does not change our results.

The third is projection effects; while the radio sources
exist in three-dimensional space, we can only measure
the bending angle projected onto the sky. Because
sources are oriented isotropically in space, the observed
bending angle for a given source could be either increased or decreased by projection; for a large sample
however, the median observed bending angle remains
consistent with the true bending angle for all but the
most bent sources (θtrue & 60◦ ). Even then, projection
will on average tend to reduce the observed bending angle, suggesting that any trends we observe with respect
to bending angle are merely lower bounds.
The fourth and largest source of error is uncertainty
due to structure in the radio emission. We estimate the
amount of error introduced by this uncertainty by comparing the measurement derived from our definition of
bending angle to an alternative measurement of the angle between the host galaxy and the most distant point
on the lowest contour on each side that does not contain
the host. We calculate the running root-mean-square
difference between the two measures of bending angle,
shown in Figure 7. This follows an approximately linear
relationship with angular size, decreasing from an estimated uncertainty of 11◦ for sources of size 0.2 arcmin
down to 6◦ for sources of size 1.1 arcmin. The diver-

gence from a linear relationship for sources larger than
1.1 arcmin is due to a small number of outliers, but does
not change our results.
From geometric arguments, the bending angle error
is proportional to the error in the position of the host
and inversely proportional to the angular extent of the
source, because the angle will be amplified if the radio
peaks are closer to the host. Bending angle is a positive
definite quantity, so the errors are not symmetric; given
the same “true” bending angle, a larger error will statistically make the source look more bent, so small sources
have their measured bending angle amplified.
The observed bending angle as a function of angular
size for sources larger than ∼0.4 arcmin is very similar to the empirically determined bending angle uncertainty. In general, we argue that this similarity in magnitude and trend shows that the relationship between
bending angle and angular size is predominantly due
to irreducible measurement uncertainties due to source
structure, and is not reflective of a physical trend. For
smaller sources, the error gets compounded by the fact
that structure becomes harder to resolve in the FIRST
images.

Given that the bending angle is dependent on the angular size of the source, due in part to inherent uncertainty in our measurement of bending angle, we correct
for this relationship prior to analyzing the correlation
of bending with other physical quantities. In particular,
source size is correlated with the separation between the
source and the cluster center. We observe that sources
beyond 1.5 r500 are on average 24% larger in physical
extent than sources within 1.5 r500 . (We show in Section 5.1 that beyond 1.5 r500 , the bending is statistically unaffected by the cluster, hence the cutoff here.)
While part of this correlation is physical (e.g. Machalski & Jamrozy 2006), selection effects such as redshift
prevent us from further analyzing this trend.
Because we are interested in the connection between
bending and separation, among others, we must remove
this confounding factor. To make this correction, we
take the sources that are beyond 1.5 r500 and fit an exponential function to the median angular size-bending
relation. We define a “corrected bending angle” as the
ratio of a source’s measured bending angle to the predicted bending angle given this relationship (fit shown
in Figure 8). We do this separately for double and triple
sources for reasons explained in the next paragraph. For
each morphology, we normalize it such that a source of
median size was unaffected by the correction. After this
correction, both the median and quartile distributions

are independent of source size, except for a minor deviation by the largest sources. We update the bending
angle threshold of 135◦ to apply to the corrected bending angle rather than the measured bending angle. This
results in our final sample of 3742 double sources and
562 triple sources (4304 total), of which 3235 double
sources and 488 triple sources are matched to clusters
within a projected 15 Mpc (3723 total).
We corrected double and triple sources separately as a
consistency test. Triple sources have a low rate of false
positive classifications, because they have radio emission
at the position of the host galaxy. However, there may
exist confusion in the classification of double sources; for
example, there may be an unrelated infrared source in
the WISE field equidistant between two regions of potentially unrelated radio emission that gets mistaken as
the host of a double source. If the host identifications in
our sample are predominantly real, we expect the size-

We start by looking at the distribution of excess bending angle as a function of the galaxy’s distance from the
cluster center, normalized by the cluster r500 . Then,
we look at this distribution as a function of the cluster
M500 . We next combine these into a single relationship,
and look at this distribution as a function of ICM gas
pressure. These three quantities will serve as proxies
for ICM density, galaxy velocity, and ram pressure, respectively. We present an analysis on the distribution
of radio tail orientations and claim it as a proxy for the
distribution of radio galaxy velocity vector orientations.
We also discuss the frequency that bent radio sources
reside within clusters versus outside them, and investigate the local environment around radio galaxies outside
of clusters. Finally, we look at asymmetry in the radio
tails. A summary of the key results is presented at the
end of this section.

5.1. Excess bending angle versus normalized separation
angle trend to be the same regardless of whether they
are double or triple sources. A significant misidentification rate of double sources would result in a different
relationship between angular size and bending angle for
double and triple sources. Figure 9 compares the sizeangle trend for double and triples sources, and we find
that the trend for double sources is consistent with the
trend for triple sources. Therefore, we conclude that
our population of double sources is dominated by correct host identifications.
Bending angle is a positive definite quantity, and
therefore has a contribution due to the uncertainty
alone. Using the corrected bending angle, we therefore
define an “excess bending angle” for each source as
q

∆θ = θcorr
− θmed,outer
(3)
where θmed,outer = 7.3◦ is the median corrected bending
angle for sources matched to clusters beyond 1.5 r500
(the outer region defined in Section 5.1). This value is
consistent with the irreducible uncertainty in measuring bending angle, which supports our argument that
sources beyond 1.5 r500 are outside the cluster’s range
of influence on bending and are thus nominally straight.
For the purposes of plotting, when θcorr < θmed,outer
and ∆θ becomes imaginary, we plot −|∆θ| instead; a
negative excess by this definition is consistent with zero
excess. More sophisticated estimates of the most probable value of ∆θ when θ . 20◦ would be required if
one were to compare the quantitative bending to specific physical models.
5. RESULTS

Galaxy clusters have ICM density profiles that generally peak strongly towards the center (Pratt & Arnaud
2002; Newman et al. 2013), although there exist clusters
with a dynamic or clumpy ICM where this assumption
may not hold (e.g. merging systems like the Bullet cluster). For a given galaxy velocity with respect to the
ICM, a denser environment should cause greater distortion of the radio jets. Therefore, we expect to see a
correlation between the bending of the radio source and
its proximity to the cluster center.
We calculate the running median of the excess bending angle, ∆θ, as a function of normalized separation
from the nearest WH15 cluster, as shown in Figure 10.
The shaded region represents the running interquartile
range. There are three distinct regions in the distribution of bending angles as a function of separation,
which we separate prior to smoothing and calculating
the trends in all figures that are plotted against separation. Beyond 1.5 r500 , we do not observe a significant
trend between bending and separation, and measure a
median ∆θ ∼ 0◦ by the definition given in Equation 3;
we call this the outer region of the cluster. Sources that
are not matched to a WH15 cluster also have median
∆θ consistent with 0◦ . In Section 3.1, we identified the
sources within 0.01 r500 as BCGs, so in all further analysis we combine these sources into a single data point
at r = 0.01 r500 . The rest of the sources lie in what we
call the inner region of the cluster, between 0.01 and
1.5 r500 . This also corresponds to approximately the
virial region of the cluster. Our data set contains 544
BCGs, 366 sources in the inner region, and 2813 sources
in the outer region.

Figure 10. Running median of excess bending angle (∆θ) as
a function of normalized separation. The shaded region represents the range between the running first and third quartiles. The running bending angles for the three regions we
define (BCGs, inner, and outer ) are calculated separately,
denoted by the breaks in the plot. ∆θ = 0, marked with the
dotted line, was defined in Equation 3 from the median corrected bending angle for sources in the outer region. Sources
below the dotted line are consistent with straight.

We find a median excess bending angle of about 8.0◦
for BCGs. The Anderson-Darling (AD) test is a statistical test used to test if a data sample comes from
a specific distribution; we use a 2-sample AD test to
rule out that BCGs and sources in the outer region are
drawn from the same bending population at the 3.7σ
level. Sources in the inner region have a median excess
bending angle of 13◦ . Between 0.01 and 1.5 r500 , the
sources become more bent as they get closer to the center of the cluster, ranging from ∆θ ∼ 0◦ at r = 1.5 r500
up to a median ∆θ ∼ 20◦ at r = 0.05 r500 . We use a
Spearman’s ρ test to determine that the correlation between separation and excess bending in the inner region
is significant at the 4.5σ level.
Figure 11 shows a sample of FIRST images of sources
from each of the three regions. (Links to the radio/IR
overlays on the RGZ forum2 for all sources in our sample are available in the supplemental data files; see
the Appendix for details.) Visual inspection suggests
that BCGs and sources in the inner region have similar bending properties to each other, but are different than sources in the outer region. While there are
a few approximately straight BCGs and inner region
sources, there are a large number of significantly bent
radio galaxies in these regions. By comparison, there

We also expect the mass of the parent cluster to affect the bending of the radio source, since the orbital
velocities of galaxies will be higher in more massive
clusters. The velocity dispersion of galaxies increases
with the square root of the mass of the cluster, so ram
pressure will be higher even at a fixed ICM density
(Becker et al. 2007; Mguda et al. 2015). We perform
a linear fit between M500 and r500 in loglog space for
the clusters in our sample and find that log10 M500 ∼
(2.95 ± 0.03) log10 r500 , i.e. the cluster mass is directly
proportional to its volume, so we argue that the ICM
density is independent of cluster mass to first order.
The influence of cluster mass on the 366 sources in the
inner region of the cluster is shown in the top plot of
Figure 12, because that is where we find the cluster has
a statistically detectable effect on the bending. We use a
Spearman’s ρ test and find that the correlation between
cluster mass and excess bending angle is significant at
the 4.2σ level. We observe an increase in the median ∆θ
of 10◦ between cluster masses of 5 and 20 × 1014 M .
We also look at the cluster mass relationship for the
544 BCG sources separately, shown in the bottom plot
of Figure 12. There is a suggestive correlation between
cluster mass and excess bending angle for the BCGs as
well. We use a Spearman’s ρ test to determine that
the correlation between cluster mass and excess bending
angle is significant at the 2.5σ level for the BCG sample,
and we observe the same increase in median ∆θ of 10◦
across the same range of cluster masses.
5.3. Excess bending angle versus pressure
The bending angle of radio emission depends on both
the mass of the galaxy cluster and the position of the
radio source within the cluster, as shown above. We
assume that the observed bending is induced by the ram
pressure exerted on the galaxy by its motion through the
2
ICM, Pram = ρicm vgal
(Begelman et al. 1979; Jones &
Owen 1979), although this argument is equivalent if it is
an ICM wind flowing past the galaxy (Burns et al. 2002).
In either case, ρicm is the ICM density and vgal is the
relative velocity between the galaxy and the ICM. Here
we use Picm , the ICM gas pressure, as a proxy for Pram ,
under the assumption that the clusters are virialized to
first order. In that case, the velocity of the galaxies and
the velocity of the ICM gas particles both scale with the
temperature of the ICM. We justify this in more detail
in Section 6.2.

vious plots of separation and mass, low pressure (<

We apply Equation 4 to our sample to get a measure of the local ICM gas pressure. Figure 13 shows
the distribution of excess bending angle as a function
of pressure, BCGs excluded. As shown in the pre-

We define the orientation angle of a source by taking
the difference between the angle bisector of the opening
angle and the radial vector from the center of the cluster.
For the purpose of this analysis, we used the “folded”
orientation, ignoring whether the source opened towards
or away from the cluster. This means that the orientation angle ranges from 0◦ if the source opened parallel
to the radial vector from the cluster (either towards or
away), and increases to 90◦ if it opened perpendicular
to the radial vector.
We measure the distributions of orientation angles for
two sub-populations: highly bent sources (∆θ > 21◦ )
and less bent sources (∆θ < 21◦ ). We choose 21◦
as the fiducial threshold for significant bending as this
captures the 16% most highly bent sources in our full
matched sample. Both sub-populations are restricted
to sources matched between 0.01 and 10 r500 . We exclude sources beyond 10 r500 to keep the contamination
below a few percent. To determine whether these samples were randomly distributed in orientation angle, we
compared the distributions to the uniform distribution
using a 1-sample AD test. The distributions and cor-

(Bottom) The distribution of orientation angles for highly

responding p-values are shown in Figure 14. The less
bent sources are uniformly distributed in orientation.
However, highly bent sources tentatively appear to be
preferentially aligned parallel to the radial vector; we
reject that they are uniformly distributed in orientation
at the 2.7σ level.
To address the question of whether buoyancy may explain the excess of radially-oriented highly bent sources,
we also looked at the “unfolded” orientation angles. Observationally, if the excess of radially-oriented sources
was due to buoyancy, then the unfolded distribution
would peak near 0◦ and drop off near 180◦ . Theoretically, pressure gradients such as those that generate

buoyant forces should be less important than ram pressure in the bending of radio sources.
We generate models of the two extremes of the probability density function (PDF) of orientations that could
arise solely due to buoyancy, which are plotted in Figure 15 alongside the unfolded distribution. Both distributions are monotonic and peak at orientations of 0◦ ,
and are constructed so as to recover the observed folded
distribution in the bottom plot of Figure 14. Model 1
is a quadratic PDF that peaks for sources opening away
from the cluster and decreases to 0 for sources opening towards the cluster; it represents the physical situation where buoyancy strongly dominates. Model 2
is a piecewise linear PDF that also peaks for sources
opening away from the cluster but plateaus for sources
that point inward of tangential; it represents the physical situation where buoyancy contributes the minimum
necessary to reproduce the folded distribution. We compare the observed unfolded distribution to both models
using a 1-sample AD test, and rule out it having been
drawn from Model 1 at the 4.8σ level and from Model 2
at the 4.1σ level. As these models cover the range of
buoyancy-driven PDFs, we rule out buoyancy as driving the preference for radial orientation.
5.5. Distribution of bent sources
While proximity to a cluster strongly affects the bending angle of a radio source, this is only a statistical excess. Other properties of the source also affect how the
jets are bent; for example, the Mach number of the jets,

or beyond.

which is not directly measurable, should negatively correlate with the amount of bending (Jones et al. 2017).
In order to assess how much of the bending can be explained using proximity alone, we show in Figure 16 the
fraction of sources in our sample above a given excess
bending angle that are within 1.5 r500 of the nearest
cluster. Here we also include in the total sources not
matched to a WH15 cluster at all. While the WH15
catalog goes out to z = 0.8, the completeness of SDSS
(and thus our unmatched sample) begins to fall off beyond z = 0.6 (Beck et al. 2016); to avoid biasing our
results due to this, we restrict the analysis in this section to sources with z < 0.6.
As shown in Figure 16, (27 ± 1)% of all sources are
within 1.5 r500 . If proximity to a cluster center were the
dominant source of bending, we might expect almost all
highly bent sources to be found within 1.5 r500. However, for sources with ∆θ > 21◦ , we find only (40 ± 5)%
within this range. Even at the largest bending angles,
most sources are beyond 1.5 r500 : the distribution peaks
at ∆θ > 50◦ , for which still only (50 ± 10)% of sources
are within 1.5 r500 . These values are similar to those of
Blanton et al. (2001). Simply due to the large number
of radio sources in our sample that are not in the interior of clusters, any particular bent source is as likely as
not to be far from a cluster. While a highly bent radio
galaxy is suggestive of a nearby cluster, its membership
in a cluster requires follow-up observations of the environment.

Figure 17. Surface density of optically-detected galaxies
around radio sources outside of clusters, i.e. sources ∼ 9 r500
from the nearest cluster, normalized by the background surface density. The background surface density of galaxies is
6.7 Mpc−2 around highly bent sources and 7.4 Mpc−2 around
less bent sources. Highly bent sources are shown with the
solid line, and less bent sources are shown with the dashed
line. The error bars for less bent sources are offset for legibility.

5.6. Environment of outer region bent sources
Some mechanism must still be bending sources, even
away from clusters. To take an initial look at this issue,
we examined the optical environments of two subsets of
radio galaxies at a median separation of 9 r500 from the
nearest cluster. The first sample consists of 150 highly
bent sources (median ∆θ ∼ 46◦ ); the second consists of
150 less bent sources (median ∆θ ∼ −7◦ ). For each of
these radio galaxies, we search SDSS for nearby galaxies
within a redshift range of ±0.04(1 + z) and within a
projected radius of 0.33◦ , and stack the resulting counts
as a function of projected physical separation.
Since we are no longer near the center of a cluster,
we measure the separation between a radio galaxy and
its optical neighbors in Mpc instead of scaling by r500 .
We find that the surface density of galaxies neighboring the radio galaxy plateaus beyond a projected 2 Mpc
from the radio galaxy, so we define the background surface density as the median surface density in an annulus
between 2 and 3 Mpc. This is 6.7 Mpc−2 around our
sample of highly bent sources and 7.4 Mpc−2 around our
sample of less bent sources. Figure 17 shows the surface
density as a function of separation from the radio source,
normalized by the background surface density.
The density excess rises sharply within 350 kpc of
the radio sources. Between 50 and 350 kpc, we estimate an enhancement in volume density by a factor of

RGZ: Radio Galaxy Distortion by Clusters
4.7 ± 0.6 for highly bent sources and 2.9 ± 0.5 for less
bent sources compared to the local background density
of SDSS galaxies. Assuming an r−2 scaling of volume
density as a function of distance to the nearest cluster
center as inferred from Figure 5, these values suggest
that the radio galaxies are in local densities of approximately 28ρcrit and 18ρcrit for highly bent and less bent
sources, respectively. Such concentrations of galaxies
are not included in the WH15 catalog because they are
not dense enough to exceed their richness threshold of
RL∗,200 ≥ 12.
5.7. Radio tail asymmetry
We look at the effect of cluster environment on the
asymmetry of the radio jets. Given a radial density gradient in the ICM, the inward-pointing jet of a radiallyaligned radio source will be in a higher density environment and should be suppressed compared to the
outward-pointing jet. While a given cluster can have
a clumpy ICM, this effect should be detectable statistically.
This analysis complements that of Rodman et al.
(2019), who performed a detailed examination of the
morphology and the galactic environment for each
source in their sample, although their sample only contained 23 sources. Here, without examining the sources
individually, we measure the length of each tail using
the distance between the host galaxy and the most distant point on the lowest radio contour that does not
contain the host. (This is the same method we used to
calibrate the bending angle uncertainty in Section 4.2.)
We separate our sample into two sub-populations: a)
the 120 inner region sources that are aligned radially
with the cluster, defined as ones where one tail is within
45◦ of the direction towards the cluster center, and the
other is within 45◦ of the direction away from the cluster center; and b) the 125 inner region sources that
are aligned tangentially to the cluster, defined as ones
where both tails are within 45◦ of tangential to the direction of the cluster center. We define the asymmetry
of the source as the ratio of the length of the inwardpointing tail to the length of the outward-pointing tail
(even tangentially-aligned sources have one tail that is
more inward-pointing than the other).
For radially-aligned sources, we observe that the
inward-pointing tail is shorter than the outwardpointing tail, and that the amount of asymmetry increases for sources closer to the center of the cluster.
We fit a line to the trend and calculate that it has a
−1
slope of 0.18 ± 0.09 r500
, and a Spearman’s ρ test determines the correlation between separation and asymmetry is significant at the 2.1σ level. By comparison, we

15

do not observe a statistically significant correlation for
tangentially-aligned sources; Spearman’s ρ test results
in only a 1.5σ result.
We look at the jet asymmetry using pressure as well.
The asymmetry should depend on the pressure gradient
across the source, which we approximate as the difference in pressure at the ends of the two tails divided by
the radial component of the source size. Using the same
sample of radially-aligned sources, the correlation between pressure gradient and asymmetry is lower than
when looking at separation only: only 1.7σ. Our simple
pressure model does not account for the asymmetry as
well as just using the position within the cluster.
5.8. Summary of results
1. Both extended radio galaxies and opticallyselected galaxies follow approximately isothermal
distributions in their separations from cluster centers centers, but the power law index for radio
galaxies (α = −1.10 ± 0.03) is slightly but significantly steeper than the one for optically-selected
ones (α = −0.94 ± 0.02).
2. BCGs exhibit extended radio emission at least
2.5 ± 0.3 times more often than the general population of cluster galaxies.
3. Median excess bending angle (∆θ), defined in
Equation 3, increases closer to the center of clusters. Sources are statistically consistent with
straight beyond 1.5 r500 , but increase to a median
excess bending angle of ∆θ ∼ 24◦ at 0.01 r500 .
4. BCGs have median ∆θ ∼ 8◦ . This makes them
more bent than non-cluster sources, but less bent
than the innermost non-BCG sources.
5. For BCGs and sources in the inner region of clusters, ∆θ correlates with cluster mass. The median
∆θ for BCGs increases by ∼ 10◦ between cluster
masses of 5 and 20 × 1014 M ; for inner region
sources, it also increases by ∼ 10◦ over the same
range of masses.
6. For non-BCG sources, ∆θ correlates with local
ICM gas pressure (a proxy for ram pressure) above
∼ 5×10−4 keV cm−3 . Below this pressure, sources
are statistically consistent with straight.
7. Highly bent sources (∆θ > 21◦ ) preferentially have
opening angles oriented parallel to the radial vector to the cluster center, but there is no particular
preference between opening towards or away. Less
bent sources (∆θ < 21◦ ) do not exhibit a preferential orientation.

8. While BCGs and sources in the inner region of
clusters are more likely to have highly bent angles
than low ones, for any given bending angle, there
are more sources outside of clusters than inside.
9. There is an excess of optically-selected neighbor
galaxies within 350 kpc around radio galaxies far
from clusters (median cluster distance ∼ 9 r500 ),
and the excess is larger around highly bent sources:
4.7 ± 0.6 and 2.9 ± 0.5 times the background volume density for highly bent and less bent sources,
respectively. This suggests that the radio galaxies
are in local densities of approximately 28ρcrit and
18ρcrit , respectively.
10. Radio tail length asymmetry exhibits a low significance (2.1σ) dependence on separation from the
cluster center. Among inner region sources that
are aligned with their tails parallel to the radial
vector, the inward-pointing tail is shorter than
the outward-pointing tail, and the difference increases for sources closer to the center of the cluster. Asymmetry exhibits a similar, but even less
significant (1.7σ), dependence on the pressure gradient across the source.
6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Distribution of radio galaxies
In generating our sample of radio galaxies, we mapped
out their projected spatial distribution around clusters
and found that they appear to be distributed according
to a power law similar to the distribution of opticallyselected galaxies in clusters. This implies that we are not
catching them at special times (e.g. if they were triggered when first encountering the outskirts of clusters).
However, the power law distribution is steeper for radio galaxies (although we do not account for differences
caused by mass segregation and defer this until future
analysis). Previous work investigating the angular twopoint correlation function, ω(θ), of radio sources on the
sky and comparing this to ω(θ) of a matched sample
of radio-quiet galaxies has also found that radio sources
exhibit greater clustering than do radio-quiet galaxies
(Wake et al. 2008).
Pimbblet et al. (2013) investigated if they could detect a preferential distribution of active galaxies (AGN)
in clusters. They did not find a difference between AGN
and the general population. This suggests that while
AGN activity in general is not preferentially triggered
by interactions with other galaxies (at least not on a
timescale before the host galaxy has moved away from
the interaction site), the AGN is more likely to be radioloud in the proximity of other galaxies. Pimbblet et al.

(2013) cross-referenced FIRST as well and found no relationship between radio luminosity and position within
the cluster, but they noted that their sample size of 28
was too small to draw a firm conclusion.
The connection between radio-loud AGN and cluster environment is also supported by Chiaberge et al.
(2015), who investigated the merger history of radioloud and radio-quiet AGN. They found that radio-loud
AGN are almost always the product of merging systems,
whereas only a fraction of radio-quiet AGN experienced
a recent merger. From a clustering perspective, galaxy
interactions will happen more often when the density of
galaxies is higher, thus connecting our result that radio
galaxies are preferentially found near other galaxies to
the result of Chiaberge et al. (2015).
6.2. Radio galaxy bending
The primary goal of this work was to investigate the
influence of the cluster on the bending of radio galaxies. Bending angle of a radio source is not a well-defined
physical quantity; the definition used in this paper is a
somewhat arbitrary approximation of a source’s physical radius of curvature, and even that breaks down
for highly disturbed sources. While it is an insufficient
parameter to compare against physical models of individual sources, it is sufficient for determining statistical
trends in morphology.
We observe two physical properties of the cluster that
correlate statistically with the bending of the source: the
position of the galaxy within the cluster and the mass
of the cluster. Using the model of ram pressure bending
first invoked by Miley et al. (1972) and quantified by
Begelman et al. (1979) and Jones & Owen (1979), we
interpret these correlations as physically corresponding
to the two components of ram pressure: the ICM density
and the relative velocity between the galaxy and ICM,
respectively.
Within the inner region of the clusters (0.01 <
r/r500 < 1.5), which is approximately equal to the
virial region (excluding the BCG), we find that sources
closer to the center have a larger median excess bending
angle (∆θ, defined in Equation 3) than sources farther
away. Beyond 1.5 r500 , the measured bending angle is
comparable to the uncertainty in our bending measurement. Close to the center of the cluster, the density of
the ICM quickly rises (Pratt & Arnaud 2002; Newman
et al. 2013), which leads to the increase in ∆θ of sources
in the denser surroundings.
Also restricted to the inner region, sources in higher
mass clusters are more bent than sources in lower mass
clusters. The velocity dispersion of the galaxies in a
cluster is proportional to the square root of the cluster

17

mass via the gas temperature (Becker et al. 2007; Mguda
et al. 2015), so M500 serves as a proxy for the relative
velocity between the source and the ICM. We find that
2.9
M500 ∝ r500
for the clusters in our sample, so we argue
that the ICM density is constant to first order as a function of cluster mass and does not play a significant role
in our result: among sources that are already in a sufficiently dense medium, the ones with statistically higher
velocities are statistically more bent.
Together, these two trends correspond to a statistical increase in ram pressure causing statistically greater
bending. In Section 5.3, we used the local gas pressure
as another proxy for this ram pressure. The effect of
ram pressure can be quantified by
2
ρicm vgal

(5)

where ρj and ρicm are the jet and ICM densities, respectively; vj is the jet velocity; vgal is the relative velocity
between host galaxy and the ICM; R is the radius of curvature of the jet axis; and h is the jet radius (Begelman
et al. 1979; Jones & Owen 1979).
If the cluster is approximately virialized, then both the
gas thermal velocity (vicm ) and the galaxy velocity scale
2
similarly with the ICM temperature, Ticm ∝ vicm
∝
2
vgal (e.g. Lubin & Bahcall 1993), justifying our use of
the static pressure Picm ∝ ρicm Ticm as a proxy for the
2
ram pressure ρicm vgal
. As long as the jet radii (h) and
lengths (`) are statistically independent of the cluster
properties, then the bending angle (θ) will scale with
Picm according to

as we have found.
According to the simulations of Marshall et al. (2018),
AGN activity is triggered when the ram pressure is
at least a factor of 2 greater than Picm . From this
we estimate that the minimum Pram required to induce significant bending is at least of order magnitude
10−3 keV cm−3 . We compare this to Mguda et al.
(2015), who used characteristic jet values from Freeland
& Wilcots (2011) to estimate that ram pressures above
6 × 10−3 keV cm−3 (in our units) were required to induce bending, which is consistent with our result. Since
we can statistically detect even very small amounts of
bending, we expect our threshold to be lower.
From simulations, bending can also be parameterized
in terms of the ratio of Mach numbers of the jet and
the ICM shock (Jones et al. 2017). For our purposes,
the Mach numbers of ICM flows and galaxy motions are

statistically independent of environment, again assuming that clusters are virialized to first order. In addition,
there may be non-environmental properties that give rise
to bent radio jets, such as precession of the central black
hole (Falceta-Gonçalves et al. 2010).
6.3. BCGs
The BCGs in our sample are only moderately bent.
While WH15 defines the center of the cluster to be the
location of the BCG, which would suggest that they
are stationary, in general this is not physically accurate. Rather, a large fraction of clusters contain BCGs
that are offset from the center of mass of the cluster and
have a small peculiar velocity with respect to the ICM
(Coziol et al. 2009; Lopes et al. 2018). Small velocities
and high densities are consistent with our observation
of moderate bending.
The excess bending of BCGs is approximately the
same as for sources between 0.6 and 1.1 r500 , but the
central density is much higher. We estimate the density ratio assuming the same generalized NFW profile
as in Section 5.3. This profile diverges at r = 0, so we
instead calculate the ICM density around the BCGs at
r = 0.01 r500 (as in Andrade-Santos et al. 2017). By
this estimation, the central density is between 45 and
250 times the density at 0.6 and 1.1 r500 , respectively.
If all galaxies in the cluster had motion with the same
velocity, then BCGs should be bent the most by ram
pressure. Because they are as bent as galaxies where
the pressure is 45 to 250 times lower, the BCG velocity
√
offset must be ρ = 7 to 16 times lower than the velocity for those galaxies near r500 . This leads to a typical
BCG velocity between 140 and 340 km s−1 ; this is consistent with Lopes et al. (2018), who report that 42%
of disturbed clusters in their sample had a BCG with a
velocity offset of at least 200 km s−1 .
We also find that BCGs are more likely to be extended
radio galaxies than the average non-BCG, by at least a
factor of 2.5. For our sample, the radio luminosity distribution of both BCGs and non-BCGs has a minimum
of approximately 2 × 1023 W Hz−1 . This luminosity is
near the upper limit of the radio luminosity function for
spiral galaxies (Mauch & Sadler 2007), which is evidence
that both sets of galaxies are drawn from a comparable
population of ellipticals. This result is consistent with
Best et al. (2007) and Croft et al. (2007), who each performed a more detailed analysis of the connection between radio-loud AGN and BCGs, and found that the
excess of radio-loud BCGs was dependent on the stellar mass of the galaxy. Best et al. (2007) reports the
excess ranges between two and ten times, depending on
the mass bin.

Garon et al.
6.4. Bent sources as tracers of environment

Because most wide-angle tail (WAT) radio sources
are associated with BCGs (O’Donoghue et al. 1993),
they can be used to detect clusters (e.g. Blanton et al.
2000). Various surveys have attempted to use more general populations of bent radio galaxies to detect clusters
as well (e.g. O’Brien et al. 2016; Paterno-Mahler et al.
2017). However, we find that bent radio sources are
not necessarily associated with the inner or virialized
regions of clusters. At every bending angle, there are
more sources beyond 1.5 r500 than near the cluster center. Observing a strongly bent source is more likely to
indicate that it is on the long tail of the distribution of
non-cluster galaxy bending angles, as opposed to being
due to cluster proximity. Of the 660 highly bent sources
(∆θ > 21◦ ) in our sample, 223 (34%) of them are within
the approximately virial region (1.5 r500 ), 455 (69%) are
found out to 10 r500 , and 67 (10%) are not matched to
a cluster within 15 Mpc at all.
We do find that radio sources in general are statistically associated with local overdensities. Within 350 kpc
of the radio source, highly bent sources on the outskirts
of clusters are located within statistically overdense regions of 4.7 times the background volume density of
galaxies; less bent sources are in statistically overdense
regions of 2.9 times the background. Other studies of
the local companion density around radio-loud galaxies
have also detected this excess; for example, Worpel et al.
(2013) found that luminous radio galaxies have almost
twice as many optical companions within 160 kpc as did
galaxies in their control sample. Now we find that highly
bent radio sources in particular have an excess number of
companions compared to less bent radio sources, which
suggests that even these small overdensities (compared
to the densities near the center of clusters) in the local
environment are sufficient to induce noticeable bending
in the radio jets, as in the model of Venkatesan et al.
(1994).
In Blanton et al. (2001), of 40 visually-identified bent
double radio galaxies, 54% were associated with galaxy
clusters and 46% were associated with galaxy groups.
Their sample was more robust than the sample in this
work because all the sources had visual confirmation
of bent morphology, but their general conclusion is the
same as ours: radio galaxies tend to be found in overdense regions, but not necessarily in clusters.
6.5. Orientation
We have used the largest sample of bent radio galaxies compiled so far to probe the orbital distribution of
galaxies in the cluster, by measuring the orientation of
the radio galaxy tails relative to the cluster. Under the

model in which the jets are bent by ram pressure due to
relative motion with respect to the ICM, the angle bisector of the opening angle would point away from the
direction of motion. O’Dea & Owen (1985) have previously attempted this same analysis with a study of
70 narrow-angle tail radio sources, and observed a radial preference within a projected 0.5 Mpc of the cluster
center but isotropic orbits beyond that.
The distribution of orbital directions in a cluster
evolves over time. When a cluster forms via mergers,
galaxies and other material tend to fall in with radial
orbits; over time, the cluster virializes and the orbits
become isotropically distributed. Measuring the degree
of isotropy reveals the evolutionary status of the cluster
(Iannuzzi & Dolag 2012).
The velocity anisotropy parameter β is used to parameterize the degree of isotropy by comparing the velocity
dispersions in the radial and tangential directions. We
use the definition given in Binney & Tremaine (1987),
β(r) = 1 −

σt2 (r)
.
σr2 (r)

(7)

The β parameter is 0 for isotropically distributed orbits, positive for preferentially radial orbits, and negative for preferentially tangential orbits. We calculated β
by decomposing the direction of motion of our sample of
highly bent sources between 0.01 and 10 r500 into radial
and tangential components, disregarding the positiondependence in Equation 7. We calculate β = 0.20±0.02,
consistent with our qualitative assessment of a radial
preference.
In our analysis, we stacked our sources by folding the
orientation angles around 90◦ . By doing so we were
able to observe the radial preference, but removed any
information about if the sources were pointing towards
or away from the cluster center. If a pressure gradient (e.g. buoyancy) was the primary driver for bending
rather than ram pressure, sources would preferentially
open away from the center of the cluster. By unfolding
the orientation angles, we observe that sources are preferentially oriented non-tangentially, but do not prefer
pointing out rather than in. Therefore, pressure gradients are not the primary driver of bending in our sample.
This is also expected from theoretical considerations.
Even in the absence of relative motion, a pressure gradient across the jet will cause it to bend. To first order,
the transverse ram pressure force per unit volume in the
jet goes as
2
ρicm vgal
Fr ∼
,
(8)
h
as in Equation 5. Assuming for simplicity that the ambient pressure gradient is orthogonal to the jet, the force

RGZ: Radio Galaxy Distortion by Clusters
due to it goes as
Picm
Fp ∼

(9)
z
where z is the pressure scale height. The ratio of the
two is simply then
2
ρicm vgal

(10)

where MA is the Mach number of the galaxy’s motion
relative to the ICM. Statistically, MA is of order unity,
so the main determining factor is the scale height of the
pressure gradient. In a relaxed ICM, this will be large,
but in a very dynamic ICM, local pressure gradients can
be fairly steep (z of order 10 kpc). Therefore, pressure
gradients are generally not expected to be the dominant
cause of bending, although situations can exist where
they are important.
6.6. Asymmetry
Whereas Rodman et al. (2019) used RGZ sources to
investigate the role of environment on the length of radio
lobes by counting the number of nearby galaxies on both
sides of the radio source, we compared the positions of
each end of the source (tail or lobe) and the ICM gas
pressure at each end using the analytical model of Arnaud et al. (2010). We come to the same conclusion as
Rodman et al. (2019) and Malarecki et al. (2015): jet
expansion into denser environments is suppressed. However, our results are more significant when asymmetry
is compared to position in the cluster rather than to
the pressure gradient across the source, suggesting that
either the density gradient is the more important contribution or that an important piece is being left out of our
simplified pressure model. In addition, Rodman et al.
(2019) specifically looked at FR-II sources, whereas our
population contains both FR-I and FR-II sources. Tail
length is not well defined for FR-I sources, and there
may be physical differences between the propagation
into the ambient medium of the diffuse lobes of FR-I
sources compared to the more collimated tails of FR-II
sources, so the inclusion of FR-I sources in our sample
may have reduced the signal.
7. CONCLUSION

In this work we investigated the effect of cluster environment on the morphology of a sample of 4304 radio
galaxies from Radio Galaxy Zoo. We found that clusters
do exert a statistical influence on the bending of radio
tails; namely, radio galaxies tend to be more bent closer
to the center of the cluster, where the ICM density is
higher. They are also more bent in higher mass clusters, where the relative velocity between the galaxy and

19

the ICM is higher. Together, this leads to the conclusion that we are observing the influence of ram pressure
exerted on the radio galaxy by the ICM, which is further supported by connecting the ram pressure to the
ICM gas pressure, which also correlates with bending.
We also look at the use of radio galaxies as a tracer for
cluster proximity; more than half of highly bent radio
galaxies in our sample are farther from clusters than
1.5 r500 , the limit of the cluster’s statistical influence on
radio bending. On the other hand, we look at a sample of highly bent radio galaxies far from the nearest
cluster, and find that these galaxies are still associated
with local local overdensities in the population of field
galaxies.
We were unable to investigate the relationship between the physical extent of the radio emission and cluster environment, as any correlation between physical size
and bending was incidentally removed as part of the
bending error correction for angular size in Section 4.2.
Even prior to the correction, redshift biases confounded
our tentative claim that sources are physically smaller
inside clusters. As we showed with our radio tail asymmetry analysis, jet propagation is somewhat suppressed
in a denser environment, so we hypothesize that the radio sources will be physically smaller. Thus, smaller
sources would also be more bent, which is unfortunately
degenerate with the sources of error in our bending measurement. Future work with a larger sample of radio
galaxies is necessary to be able to tease apart this association from the measurement uncertainty. As machine learning algorithms are developed to identify and
classify radio galaxies from forthcoming large-scale radio
surveys such as EMU (Norris et al. 2011) and the VLASS
(Myers & VLASS Survey Team 2018), and much more
extensive optical surveys such as Pan-STARRS (Chambers et al. 2016) become available for host searches, we
should be able to identify second-order correlations such
as this. Machine learning may also lead to a more physically significant definition of what qualities define bending angle, rather than the approximation used in this
work.
We plan to follow up this paper with a detailed look
at the relaxation states of the clusters, and how that
impacts our bending results. In particular, we will be
able to investigate whether disturbed clusters contain
BCGs that have more distorted radio morphologies, and
whether a connection between the distribution of velocity vector orientations derived from the radio bending
and the relaxation state can be measured.

APPENDIX
We present two supplementary data tables: one consisting of the 3723 sources matched to WH15 within a projected
separation of 15 Mpc and redshift difference of ±0.04(1 + z), and the other consisting of the 581 sources not matched
to WH15. The full, machine-readable version of these tables are available; a portion of the matched table is shown
in Table 2 for guidance on form and content. The unmatched table is formatted the same, but without columns 14
through 24. A description of all parameters and columns is as follows:
Column 1: Radio Galaxy Zoo source name.
Column 2: Zooniverse subject name. The radio/IR overlays used for classification can be found at radiotalk.
galaxyzoo.org/#/subjects/ARG000****, where ARG000**** is the Zooniverse subject name.
Column 3: Radio morphology. Double sources are denoted by 2 and triple sources are denoted by 3.
Column 4: Largest angular size (LAS) of the source, defined as the diagonal of the bounding box that contains the
outermost (4σ) FIRST contours, in units of arcminutes. The error in source size is dominated by the arbitrary contour
threshold in the FIRST images and would require detailed modeling to estimate.
Column 5: R.A. (J2000) of the SDSS host galaxy.
Column 6: Decl. (J2000) of the SDSS host galaxy.
Column 7: Redshift of the SDSS host galaxy.
Column 8: Uncertainty in the redshift of the SDSS host galaxy.
Column 9: Type of redshift used. Spectroscopic redshifts were used when available and are denoted by s; otherwise,
photometric redshifts were used and are denoted by p.
Column 10: Measured bending angle (θ) of the source, in units of degrees. The error in θ and derived quantities
(θcorr , ∆θ, and φ) can only be determined statistically, as discussed in Section 4.1.
Column 11: Corrected bending angle of the source (θcorr ), in units of degrees. See Section 4.2 for more information.
Column 12: Excess bending angle of the source (∆θ), in units of degrees. See Section 4.2 for more information.
Column 13: Source asymmetry (Asym.), defined as the ratio of the lengths of the inward-pointing tail to the
outward-pointing tail. For sources not matched to clusters, a tail was randomly selected as the “inward-pointing” one.
See Section 5.7 for more information.
Column 14: WH15 cluster name.

Column 19: Separation (r) from the nearest WH15 cluster, in units of r500 . Because separations less than 0.01 r500
are not physically meaningful (see Section 3.1), we have truncated the values to two decimal points. The error in r,
assuming a correct host identification, is limited by the positional and redshift uncertainty in SDSS.
Column 20: Radius (r500 ) of the nearest WH15 cluster, in units of Mpc.
Column 21: Mass (M500 ) of the nearest WH15 cluster, in units of 1014 M .

information.
Column 23: Orientation (φ) of the source opening angle with respect to the nearest WH15 cluster, in units of
degrees. This is the “unfolded” orientation angle discussed in Section 5.4, where sources with orientation φ < 90◦
open away from the cluster and sources with orientation φ > 90◦ open towards the cluster.
Column 24: Alignment (Align.) of the source tails with respect to the cluster. Radially-aligned sources are denoted
by r, tangentially-aligned sources are denoted by t, and all other sources are denoted by o. See Section 5.7 for more
information.
