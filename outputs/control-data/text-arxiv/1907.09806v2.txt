We study general entanglement properties of the excited states of the one dimensional translational
invariant free fermions and coupled harmonic oscillators. In particular, using the integrals of motion,
we prove that these Hamiltonians independent of the gap (mass) have infinite excited states that
can be described by conformal field theories with integer or half-integer central charges. In the
case of free fermions, we also show that because of the huge degeneracy in the spectrum, even
a gapless Hamiltonian can have excited states with an area-law. Finally, we study the universal
average entanglement entropy over eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of the free fermions introduced
recently in [L. Vidmar, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 020601 (2017)]. In particular, using a duality
relation, we map the average bipartite entanglement entropy over all the exponential number of
eigenstates of a generic free fermion Hamiltonian to the problem of the calculation of the average
multi bipartite entanglement entropy over a single eigenstate of the XX-chain. This relation can
be useful for experimental measurement of the universal average entanglement entropy. Part of our
conclusions can be extended to the quantum spin chains that are associated with the free fermions
via Jordan-Wigner(JW) transformation.

INTRODUCTION

Bipartite entanglement entropy of quantum manybody systems exhibits a wide variety of interesting properties with a myriad of applications in high-energy and
condensed matter physics. Some of the earliest studies were the calculation of the entanglement entropy of
the ground state (GS) of the coupled harmonic oscillators
and the establishment of the area-law in the same models
in1–3 . In Ref4 , the same quantity was calculated for the
ground state of the conformal field theories (CFT) and
the famous logarithmic-law with the central charge as the
coefficient of the logarithm was derived. These studies
were followed with many other interesting results which
paved the way to better understanding of the bipartite
entanglement entropy of the ground state of the free
fermions5–7 , coupled harmonic oscillators8–10 , quantum
spin chains11–13 , CFTs14 and topological systems15,16 .
To review various applications of the bipartite entanglement entropy of the ground state in many-body quantum
systems and quantum field theories see17–24 and25–27 respectively. Although the investigation of the bipartite
entanglement entropy of the ground state of quantum
systems has a long history the same is not true for the
excited states. The bipartite entanglement entropy of the
excited states in the quantum spin chains was first studied with exact methods in28 , see also29 . Then the entanglement entropy of the low-lying excited states in CFTs
was calculated in30,31 . For recent numerical calculations
regarding the entanglement entropy of the excited states
in the quantum spin chains and free fermions see32–47 .
For further results on the entanglement entropy of the
low-lying excited states in CFTs see48–54 . Recently, there
have also been analytical calculations regarding the quantum entanglement content of the quasi-particle excitations in massive field theories and integrable chains55,56 .
It is widely believed that one expects universality and

quantum field theory for the ground state (and lowlying excited states) of the quantum many-body systems
at and around quantum phase transition point. This
has been one of the reasons that most of the studies
were focused on the bipartite entanglement entropy of
the ground states. Nevertheless, some typical behaviors
(volume-law) have been already observed for the excited
states too, see Refs33–35 . Some further analytical and numerical results were also obtained for the average of the
entanglement entropy in38,43,44 which support some sort
of universality. In this paper, we would like to study the
entanglement content of the excited states of the generic
translational invariant one dimensional free fermions and
coupled harmonic oscillators. The quantity of interest is
the von Neumann entropy which is defined for a system
by partitioning it to A and Ā, where in this paper A has
l contiguous sites, and Ā has L − l sites where we will occasionally send L to infinity. The von-Neumann entropy
is
SvN = −trρl ln ρl ,

(1)

where ρl is the reduced density matrix of the part A.
Although in this article we will focus on the von Neumann
entropy one can almost trivially extend the results to also
Rényi entropies too. For the ground state of the gapped
systems SvN saturates with the size of the subsystem13 ,
this is called an area-law. For the short-range critical one
dimensional systems we have logarithmic-law4,14 , i.e.
c hL

SvN = ln
sin[ ] + const,

where c is the central charge of the underlying CFT.
When the SvN changes linearly with l as happens typically for the excited states, we call it a volume-law. In
this paper, we will present some exact results that in
some cases can be even considered rigorous theorems.
Most notably for one dimensional free fermions and coupled harmonic oscillators we prove the followings: (1) All

2
the Hamiltonians (independent of having a gap or not)
have a lot of non-low lying excited states that can be
described by CFT and have an arbitrary integer central
charge. For free fermions sometimes we can also have
excited states with half-integer central charges. (2) The
degenerate excited states depending on the chosen subspace basis can follow volume-law, logarithmic-law and
sometimes even an area-law. (3) For free fermions (and
corresponding spin chains) there is a set of Hamiltonians that the ground state of every generic free fermion
is one of the eigenstates of these Hamiltonians. In other
words, one can find the ground state of a generic Hamiltonian as one of the eigenstates of these Hamiltonians.
Excited states with integer central charges have been realized before in the context of the XX chain in28 , see
also29 . However, our results extend those conclusions
to the generic translational invariant free fermions and
coupled harmonic oscillators. In addition, our simple
method not only explains the existence of these kinds of
excited states it also gives a natural way to make some
statements regarding the average entanglement entropy
studied in38,43,44 . In particular, combining the result
of38 with a duality relation introduced in57 we discover a
method to calculate the average bipartite entanglement
entropy over all the eigenstates of a generic free fermion
Hamiltonian using a single eigenstate of the XX-chain
with just a simple hopping coupling. Using this mapping
instead of studying an exponential number of states one
can just work with a single state which makes the previously considered unmeasurable quantity quite accessible
for the experimental study.
The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we first
define the Hamiltonian of generic translational invariant
free fermions. Then for later arguments, we present some
integrals of motion of these Hamiltonians. To clarify the
argument, we then consider the XX chain and prove some
statements regarding the entanglement content of this
model. After that, we extend our arguments to the general free fermions. Then we comment on the average entanglement over the excited states of free fermions, the
role of the degeneracies, and how to measure specific averaging introduced in38 . In section III, we will define
the Hamiltonian of generic coupled harmonic oscillators
and then using the relevant integrals of motion; we will
study the bipartite entanglement entropy of the excited
states for these models. Finally in the last section we will
conclude the paper.

is c = m. In the Figure 1 we show the logarithmic
behavior (and the corresponding coefficient) of the en−

m = 1, 2, 3 . Based on the above arguments one can
conclude that there are infinite conformal excited states
with logarithmic scaling of the entanglement in the spectrum of HXX with the central charge c = m, where m can
be any integer number. In the above, we looked to the
finite m when L goes to infinity. However, it is clear that
if m is comparable to L, then one would expect for large
L probably a volume-law instead of a logarithmic behavior. This is indeed correct as it was shown in the Ref29

The Hamiltonian and the integrals of motion share a
common eigenbasis. That means, for example, the
ground state of In+ (XX) appears as the excited state of
HXX . We use this basic fact to prove our statements.
Following58 , and references therein, it is easy to see that
for In+ (XX) we have f (z) = −(z n + z −n ) which have 2n
zeros on the unit circle and so its ground state is critical and in the limit of large L it can be described by a
CFT with the central charge c = n. This can be also
checked by calculating the entanglement entropy analytically (using the FH theorem28 ) and numerically (using
the Peschel method6 , see appendix B) by hiring the correlation matrix Cjk = hc†j ck i. For the ground state of

states follows a volume-law with a subleading term which
is logarithmic. In the Figure 1 we show the linear behavior of the entanglement entropy of the ground state of

an infinite number of this kind of energy excited states

Note that in these cases the corresponding Hamiltonians
In+ (XX) are not local Hamiltonians. We note that there
are also excited states that follow an area-law. For example, the states |11...1i and |00...0i have energy zero and

discuss soon this observation is more pronounced.
For generic free fermions, the arguments are similar:

that the ground state of these integrals of motion should

still infinite excited states in the spectrum that are conformal invariant with the central charge c = m and follow

A.

VHBR averaging and a proposal for
measurement

In the case of the periodic free fermions, we expect a
lot of degeneracy in the excited states. As it was discussed in more detail in the Appendix C the number of
independent energies over the size of the Hilbert space
decays exponentially with respect to the size of the system which indicates an enormous number of degeneracies. The way that one defines the excited state might
be significant in getting area, logarithmic or volume law
for the entanglement entropy. Recently in38,43 it was observed that if one takes all the eigenstates produced by

the creation operators ηk† and calculates the bipartite entanglement entropy of a connected region the result is
universal and independent of the Hamiltonian. Here we
would like to comment that the result can be different if
one takes into account the degeneracies. For this purpose
in Figure 3 we did the averaging for the XX chain in four
different ways: The first one is the averaging proposed
in38,43 (VHBR). Second (third) we identify the degenerate states and pick the one with the minimum (maximum) entanglement entropy, then we do the averaging
over the selected independent states. We call this MIN
(MAX) averaging. Finally, in the last averaging we first
identify the degenerate states and average over the entanglement entropy inside the subspace and then average
over all the averaged entanglement entropies (WA averaging), for more details see Appendix C. In Figure 3, one
can see that the VHBR and the WA averagings converge
to the same value but the MIN and the MAX averagings converge to the different values. This clearly shows
that the averaging done in the38,43 is special. Remarkably, the averaging and universality proposed in these
papers have a good chance to be measured experimentally. This is because of a recent duality proposed in57 .
In this work, it was shown that there is a one to one correspondence between bipartite entanglement entropy of the
excited states (produced by the ηk† ) of the XX-chain and
the entanglement entropy of one eigenstate (the ground
state for the case of l = L2 ) but with different partition. There are 2L possible multi interval bipartitions
for the eigenstate of the XX-chain which is identically
equal to the one interval bipartite entanglement entropy
of 2L excited states. Using this method it is possible to
regenerate the universal figure proposed in38 , see Figure

are the excited modes. Then consider a subset of sites
A = {x1 , x2 , ..., xM } ⊂ {0, ..., L − 1}. Based on57 if we
consider S(A; ψ) as the entanglement of the sites A with
respect to the rest for the pure state |ψi, then we have
S(A; K) = S(K; A),

(15)

for any entropy functional. We now discuss a few examples of the above equality. For the half-filling to get
the ground state, we need to fill all the negative modes
which make half of the modes that are adjacent in the set
K. This means the entanglement entropy of the ground
state for the set A is equal to the entanglement entropy
of the half of the system for an eigenstate with the modes
A excited. Of course, if one averages over the entanglement entropy of all the possible sets A one recover the
average entanglement entropy VHBR for half of the system. Now consider we are interested in the averaging of
VHBR for one site, in another word, A = {x1 }. This can
be calculated by finding the average of the entanglement
entropy of all the multi interval bipartitions of the state
K = {k1 } with just one mode excited. The rest of the
VHBR graph can be produced similarly by calculating
the average of the entanglement entropy of all the multi
interval bipartitions of one eigenstate.
The above remarkable observation means that one can
calculate the average entanglement entropy by just calculating the entanglement entropy of all the multi interval
bipartitions for a single eigenstate. The entanglement entropy of different partitions in the spin chains has been
already studied theoretically and experimentally in61,62 .
The method proposed and implemented in these works
gives access to the entanglement entropy of all the 2L different partitions for a particular state. Extension of this
technique to free fermions can make it an outstanding
method to measure the universal average entanglement
entropy proposed in38,43 . It is important to mention that
because of the non-local nature of the JW transformation the average over the entanglement of all the possible
bipartitions of the GS in the free fermions and the equivalent spin chains are not equal63 .

COUPLED HARMONIC OSCILLATORS
(CHO)

In this section we generalize the ideas of the previous
section to coupled harmonic oscillators. The Hamiltonian
of a periodic CHO can be written as
H(K, P) =

L
1 X
(π̂i Pij π̂j + φ̂i Kij φ̂j ),
2 i,j=1

(16)

where P and K are symmetric positive definite matrices. For translational invariant cases, these matrices are
circulant matrices. The ground state of the above Hamiltonian can be written as

K 1/2 1/4 − 1 hφ|K 1/2 |φi
Ψg ({φi }) = det
e 4
. (17)
π

The ground state does not depend on the matrix P which
clearly also means that the entanglement entropy of the
ground state is also independent of the matrix P. To find
a set of integrals of motion for the above Hamiltonian
we consider the operator, H̃ = H(K̃, P̃). This operator
commutes with the Hamiltonian as far as
P.K̃ − P̃.K = 0.

(18)

Without loosing generality now consider P = I then we
have K̃ = P̃.K. Since the P̃ can be chosen arbitrarily one can have very generic circulant matrix K̃. The
ground state of H̃ which is the excited state of H can now
have very generic form with quite general entanglement
content. As the most natural example we first consider
discrete massive Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian with the following K matrix

The above matrix is just a massive discrete Laplacian
on a circle. In the limit of large L when m = 0 the
underlying conformal field theory has the central charge
c = 1. Consequently the entanglement entropy grows
logarithmically in this case. However, for the massive
case we have an area-law2,3,64,65 . These results can be
easily checked numerically using the method described
in64,65 , see Appendix B. Now consider the Hamiltonian

where βr ’s are different real numbers66 . For example, we
can take βr = 2π Lr with r ∈ {1, 2, ..., L−1}. Following67 ,
consider eiβr ’s appear in complex conjugate form and we
have 2n of them which n is not proportional to the size
of the system and αr = 1. Then we expect to have a free
field theory H̃ with a ground state that have the central
charge n + 1, see67 . When n is proportional to the size
of the system we expect to get a volume-law as we had
in the case of the free fermions. Numerical calculations
presented in the Figures 4 confirm the above expectation.
We note that since the K̃ matrix always has a singular
part (with this method) it is not possible to generate an
excited state which follows the area-law. When m 6= 0
the ground state and the low-laying states follow an arealaw. However, if we choose the P̃ as (20) then one can
generate a K̃ matrix which is singular and follows the
logarithmic-law or the volume-law. In other words, as
the case of free fermions even for massive cases we have
a lot of excited states that can be described by CFT.

CONCLUSIONS

We showed that independent of the gap a generic translational invariant free-fermion Hamiltonian in one dimension has infinite eigenstates that follow logarithmic-law of
entanglement and can be described by CFT. We argued
that because of the huge degeneracy, even a Hamiltonian
with a critical GS can in principle have a lot of excited
states with an area-law behavior. Similar conclusions are
valid also for the excited states of the corresponding spin
chains. We also proposed a method to measure the recently proposed universal average entanglement entropy
over all the exponential number of eigenstates of a generic
free fermion Hamiltonian by averaging over multi interval
bipartite EE of just a single eigenstate of the XX-chain.
We finally extended our discussion to the generic HOs in
one dimension. It will be interesting to explore in more
detail the averaging over the multi interval bipartite EE
of the eigenstates of the generic free fermions and also
spin chains.

This section serves to pay more attention to the spin
version of the integrals of motion and the fermionic
Hamiltonian defined in the main text. In most of the
cases, the integrals of motion do not have a simple form.
−
However, one can still claim that the Hamiltonian Im
which is parameter independent in the spin version, commutes with all the possible Hamiltonians and integrals of
motion and so it provides bases which in those bases the
average of entanglement entropy is equal for the eigen−
and the Hamiltonian. We begin by writing

where N̂ = l=1 σlz , is the parity of the spins down, i.e.
the parity of the number of fermions. Because of the
string of σ z , the JW transformation is non-local. The
non-locality of the JW transformation affects the boundary conditions through appearance of the operator N̂ .
The eigenvalues: N = +1 and − 1 correspond to antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions respectively.
The operator N̂ should appear every time we go from
spin format to fermion format or vice versa. For instance,

There is also the possibility to write the spin form of
our quantities of interest in a way that operator N̂ does
not appear explicitly. As it can be seen, whenever a product of two fermionic operators at sites i and j is written
in the Pauli spin operators, there is a string of σ z between these two sites. As in equations (A15) and (A14),
we placed the string of spin-z operator in the smallest
path between our lattice sites. However, In the boundary
terms, this smallest path is passing through the boundz z
ary. Therefore, we face terms like · · · σL
σ1 · · · accompanied with operator N̂ . If before the JW-transformation,
(†)

we rearrange our fermionic operators ci and cj in a
way that the operator with smaller index comes on the
left of the operator with a bigger index. In particular,

Appendix C: Structure of degeneracies and average
entanglement over excited states of the XX-chain

In this appendix, we tend to present a detailed study
of various averagings of entanglement entropy for a periodic free fermion system in excited states. By excited
states, we mean eigenstates of Hamiltonian produced by
the action of ηk† on the vacuum state of the XX-chain;
Among these states, there are sets of degenerate states.
In38 , the authors calculated the entanglement entropy for
all the states produced as explained above, and then they
took the average of all the entropies calculated without
counting for degenerate states. Here, we revisit the work
of38 by taking into account the degeneracies. First, we
identify the degenerate states and then preform various
averagings on the entanglement entropies.
Degenerate Energy States: The XX-chain can be
solved exactly by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian using
the Fourier transformation, as written in the main text.
Each excited state can be produced by acting on the
vacuum with a set of creation operators with different
modes. Each mode ηk has energy
|f (k)|;

k = 1, 2, · · · , L,

(C1)

where L is the size of the system. For instance, states
|ψ m i and |ψ n i can be degenerate (E m = E n ) but they
are made of different combinations of η † ’s.
†
|ψ m i = ηm
η † η † · · · |0i,
1 m2 m3

|ψ n i = ηn† 1 ηn† 2 ηn† 3 · · · |0i,

{km1 , km2 , km3 , · · · } =
6 {kn1 , kn2 , kn3 , · · · }.
For instance in XX model, the energy of the modes
with k = l and k = L − l is the same, therefore the degeneracy in the eigenstates is expected. To unravel these
groups of degenerate eigenstates as accurate as possible
(machine precision), we first calculated the minimum energy gap (∆Emin ) of the spectrum. Since in these types
of Hamiltonians the energy levels are not equally spaced,
the ∆Emin helps us to have an idea for the required precision value to decide whether two energies are equal or
not. Not surprisingly, as shown in the inset of the figure 5, this gap decreases exponentially with the size of
the system which makes the decision that two states are
degenerate or not more difficult by increasing the size of
the system. After finding all the degeneracies, we sum
over all the non-degenerate states and call the number
Nind . This number which we loosely call the number of
independent states is exponentially smaller than the dimension of the Hilbert space. In other words, as shown
decays exponentially with
in the figure 5, the ratio NNind
T
the size of the system L. This indicates the presence of
an enormous amount of degeneracies in the spectrum of
the XX-chain.
Averaging Types: Because of the huge degeneracy in
the spectrum of periodic free fermions it is clear that one
has a lot of freedom in choosing an eigenstate with different amount of entanglement. The more degeneracy
means that there is more freedom in picking a state with
very large or very small entanglement content. The sum

of two maximmaly entangled states can be in principle
a product state with zero entanglement. The reverse is
also true, the sum of two product states can be maximmaly entangled. When there is a degeneracy in the spectrum it is not feasible to look for a state with max/min
entanglement. We take another approach by focusing
on the eigenstates that one can find by the method of
previous section. After creating all the eigenstates, we
calculated the entanglement entropy using the Peschel
formula6 which is valid also for the excited eigenstates.
Note that this is not the case for an arbitrary state due
to the lack of Wick’s theorem. After getting the entanglement entropy for all the eigenstates, we averaged these
entanglements for LA from 1 to L − 1 in four different
ways.

We note that this sum can be simplified formally but for
numerical calculations the above form is more useful.
We note that although the two correlation matrices (13)
and (14) are different they have the same set of eigenvalues.
