Abstract
The open problem on whether or not the chirality exists in doublet bands M1 and M4 in lightmass even-even nucleus 60 Ni is studied by adopting the recently developed fully quantal four-j shells
triaxial particle rotor model. The corresponding experimental energy spectra, energy differences
between doublet bands, and the available B(M 1)/B(E2) values are successfully reproduced. The
analyses on the basis of the angular momentum components, the azimuthal plots, and the K-plots
suggest that the chiral modes exist at I ≥ 12~ in doublet bands M1 and M4.

Nuclear chiral rotation is an exotic form of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which exists
only in nucleus with triaxial ellipsoidal shape. In 1997, Frauendorf and Meng proposed that
the total angular momentum vector of a rotating triaxial nucleus may lie outside the three
principal planes in the intrinsic frame. Such an angular momentum geometry can, in the
laboratory frame, give rise to a pair of nearly degenerate ∆I = 1 bands with the same parity,
i.e., chiral doublet bands [1]. So far, more than 50 chiral candidates have been reported in
odd-odd, odd-A, and even-even nuclei that spread over A ∼ 80 [2], 100 [3–10], 130 [11–21],
and 190 mass regions [22, 23]. For more details, see reviews [24–29] and very recent data
tables [30].
During the process of investigating nuclear chirality, exploring novel chiral phenomena
and searching for new chiral candidates are the two fundamental goals all the time. For the
former, e.g., the multiple chiral doublets (MχD) phenomenon, i.e., having multiple pairs of
chiral doublet bands in a single nucleus, was theoretically predicted and explored by the
state-of-art covariant density functional theory (CDFT) [31–37] and observed in
103

Rh [39], 78 Br [40],

136

133

Ce [38],

Nd [41, 42], and 195 Tl [43]. These observations confirm the existence

of triaxial shapes coexistence [31, 38, 41, 43], and reveal the stability of chiral geometry
against the increasing of intrinsic excitation energy [39, 44–47] and octupole correlations [40].
For the latter, the experimental evidence of chiral doublet bands was first observed in the
A ∼ 130 mass region, and then followed by the A ∼ 100, 190, and 80 mass regions. These
observations show that the nuclear chirality is not a specific phenomenon that exists in only
one nucleus or one mass region.
Both of the two fundamental goals and all of relevant observations mentioned above
encourage us to search for new candidates with chirality or MχD in new mass regions. In
Ref. [37], we explored the MχD in A ∼ 60 mass region by the adiabatic and configurationfixed constrained CDFT for cobalt isotopes. It was found that there are high-j particle(s)
and hole(s) configurations with prominent triaxially deformed shapes in these isotopes, which
suggests the possibility of chirality or multiple chirality in A ∼ 60 mass region. However,
the experimental energy spectra and electromagnetic transition in these isotopes are rather
rare at present.
We note that in Ref. [48], the fully microscopic self-consistent tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theory (TAC-CDFT) was applied to investigate the observed dipole
bands M1, M2, M3, and M4 in even-even nucleus
2

60

Ni [49]. It was mentioned that bands

M1 and M4 might be the possible candidates for chiral doublet bands. However, due to the
mean-field approximation, the TAC can only give the description for the band M1. After
that, there is neither further theoretical nor experimental work to investigate bands M1 and
M4 in

60

Ni. Therefore, whether the chirality exists in the bands M1 and M4 or not is still

an open problem.
The aim of the present work is to investigate the chirality in doublet bands M1 and M4
in 60 Ni in a fully quantal model. As a quantal model coupling the collective rotation and the
single-particle motions, the particle rotor model (PRM) has been widely used to describe the
chiral doublet bands and achieved major successes [24]. In contrast to the TAC approach,
PRM describes a system in the laboratory frame. The total Hamiltonian is diagonalized
with total angular momentum as a good quantum number, and the energy splitting and
quantum tunneling between the doublet bands can be obtained directly. Moreover, the
basic microscopic inputs for PRM can be obtained from the constrained CDFT [9, 31, 38–
40, 50, 51]. Various versions of PRM have been developed to investigate the chiral doublet
bands with different kinds of configurations [1, 9, 16, 23, 38, 39, 47, 51–64]. To describe the
doublet bands M1 and M4 in

60

Ni with four quasi-particle configuration [48, 49], a four-j

shell PRM is needed. Such version of PRM has already been developed very recently and
applied to describe the MχD in

136

Nd [42].

In this letter, the four-j shell PRM will be applied to study the energy spectra and
the electromagnetic transition probabilities of the doublet bands M1 and M4 in 60 Ni, and to
explore the open problem on whether or not the chirality exists in this doublet by examining
their angular momentum geometries.
The formalism of PRM with four-j shell can be found in Ref. [42]. The total wave function
of PRM Hamiltonian is expanded into the strong coupling basis

Based on these analyses, one can study the angular momentum geometries systematically
to make an unambiguous judgment whether or not the chiral geometry exists in the doublet
bands.
In the PRM calculations for the doublet bands M1 and M4 in

60

Ni, the configuration

π(1f7/2 )−1 (2p3/2 )1 ⊗ ν(1g9/2 )1 (1f5/2 )−1 [48, 49] is adopted. The deformation parameters

β = 0.27 and γ = 19◦ for this configuration at the bandhead were obtained from the
microscopic self-consistent TAC-CDFT calculations [48]. With the rotation, the β value
decreases smoothly, while γ value shows a smoothly increasing tendency. In the PRM
calculation, the deformation parameters are fixed. To reproduce the energy spectra better,
we use a deformation of β = 0.27 and γ = 22◦ . The moment of inertia J0 = 9.0 ~2 /MeV
and Coriolis attenuation factor ξ = 0.98 are adopted according to the experimental energy
spectra. For the electromagnetic transitions, the empirical intrinsic quadrupole moment
√
Q0 = (3/ 5π)R02 Zβ, and gyromagnetic ratios for rotor gR = Z/A and for nucleons gp(n) =
gl + (gs −gl )/(2l + 1) (gl = 1(0) for protons (neutrons) and gs = 0.6gs (free)) [68] are adopted.

The calculated energy spectra for the bands M1 and M4 in 60 Ni are presented in Fig. 1(a),

together with the corresponding data. The experimental energy spectra are reproduced

excellently by the PRM calculations. Such a good agreement can be more clearly seen by
showing the energy level scheme in Fig. 1(d).
Being a fully quantal model, PRM is capable of reproducing the energy splitting ∆E
between the doublet bands for the whole observed spin region. This is illustrated in Fig. 1(b).
The ∆E increases firstly from I = 9 to 11~, and then decreases up to I = 14~. At I = 15~,
an increasing trend is observed once again in the PRM results. It is known that in an ideal
chiral system with the particle-hole configuration π(1h11/2 )1 ⊗ ν(1h11/2 )−1 and a rotor with

the deformation parameter γ = 30◦ , the ∆E is small (less than 400 keV) and shows a trend
that decreases firstly and then increases [1, 56]. Here, at I ≥ 12~, the ∆E shows the similar
variation trend, giving a hint that chirality might exist in bands M1 and M4. The large ∆E
(higher than 400 keV) could be owed to the small triaxial deformation [47, 54]. Therefore, it

would be very interesting to extend the spectrum of band M4, which only reaches to I = 13~
currently, to higher spins to further verify the theoretical calculations.
In Fig. 1(c), the B(M1)/B(E2) values of bands M1 and M4 calculated by PRM in

5

comparison with the available data are shown. One observes that the PRM calculations
show a good agreement with the data at I = 11 and 12~ for band M1. At I = 13 and 14~,
the calculated B(M1)/B(E2) is smaller than the data. This is because the decrease of β with
the rotation [48] is not taken into account in the present PRM calculations. The calculated
B(M1)/B(E2) for band M4 at I = 13~ is very large. It is caused by, as shown later, the wave
function structure changes dramatically from I = 12 to 13~. The calculated B(M1)/B(E2)
values of bands M1 and M4 at I = 14 and 15~ are similar, which further implies the chirality
exists. Therefore, further experimental efforts on extracting electromagnetic transition data
for band M4 are highly demanded to obtain solid evidence.
The rotational motion of triaxial nuclei attains a chiral character if the angular momentum has substantial projections on all three principal axes of the triaxially deformed
nucleus [1]. The successes in reproducing the energy spectra and available electromagnetic
60

transition probabilities for the doublet bands M1 and M4 in

Ni motivate us to investigate

the expectation values of the squared angular momentum components along the short (s-),
intermediate (i-), and long (l-) axes for the rotor, valence protons, and valence neutrons. As
shown in Fig. 2, the substantial projections of angular momentum on three principal axes

and long (l-, triangles) axes of the rotor, valence protons, and valence neutrons angular momenta
calculated as functions of spin by PRM for the doublet bands M1 and M4 in

60 Ni.

For both bands M1 and M4, the collective core angular momentum mainly aligns along
the i-axis in the whole spin region, because it has the largest moment of inertia. In band M4,
6

the s- and l- components of the rotor angular momentum exhibit discontinuous behaviors
from I = 11 to 12~. This is understood as the reason of abrupt increases of B(M1)/B(E2)
values, as discussed previously. The angular momenta of the f7/2 valence proton and f5/2
valence neutron holes mainly align along the l-axis, and that of valence neutron g9/2 particle
mainly along the s-axis. At high spin region in band M1, the i-component (s-component)
of g9/2 particle gradually increases (decreases). For p3/2 proton, the s- and i- components
are similar to each other. Such orientations form the chiral geometry of aplanar rotation.

FIG. 3: The azimuthal plots, i.e., profiles for the orientation of the angular momentum on the
(θ, ϕ) plane calculated by PRM at I = 9, 11, 12, 14, and 15~ for the doublet bands M1 and M4 in
60 Ni.

The spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking or chiral geometry is realized by the total
angular momentum lying outside the three principal planes in the intrinsic frame [1]. In
order to visualize the angular momentum geometry in the intrinsic frame, the azimuthal
plots [56, 66, 67], i.e., profiles P(θ, ϕ) for the orientation of the angular momentum on the
(θ, ϕ) plane calculated by PRM using Eq. (4) are shown in Fig. 3 for the doublet bands M1
and M4 in

60

Ni at I = 9, 11, 12, 14, and 15~. We emphasize that θ is the angle between the

total spin I and the l-axis, and ϕ is the angle between the projection of I onto the si-plane
and the s-axis. As is shown in Fig. 3, the azimuthal plots are symmetric with respect to
ϕ = 0◦ . This is because the broken chiral symmetry in the intrinsic frame has been restored
in PRM.
7

For I = 9 (bandhead) and 11~ (kink of ∆E), the profiles for the orientation of the angular
momentum for band M1 have only one single peak at (θ ∼ 45◦ , ϕ = 0◦ ), which suggests that
the angular momentum stays within the sl-plane. Instead, the profiles for band M4 peak at
(θ = 90◦ , ϕ = 0◦ ), corresponding to a principal axis rotation with respect to s-axis. Such two
orientations do not form a chiral geometry. Therefore, not chirality is shown for I = 9-11~.
This is also the reason why the energy splitting ∆E increases at this spin region, as shown
in Fig. 1(b).
For I = 12~, the profile for band M1 still peaks at ϕ = 0◦ . However, that for band M4
shows a node around (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ = 0◦ ) with the onset of two peaks locating at (θ ∼ 45◦ , ϕ ∼
45◦ ) and (θ ∼ 45◦ , ϕ ∼ −45◦ ), respectively. The appearances of node and two peaks are
consistent with the picture of a 0-phonon state in band M1 and 1-phonon vibration in band
M4 [56, 66, 67]. Therefore, the chiral vibration is demonstrated for I = 12~. Due to the
chiral vibration, the i- (s-) component of the rotator angular momentum at I = 12~ for
band M4 is larger (smaller) than that for band M1, as shown in Fig. 2.
For I = 14~, two peaks corresponding to aplanar orientations are found in the both
of doublet bands, i.e., (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ ∼ 60◦ ) and (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ ∼ −60◦ ) for band M1, while

(θ ∼ 55◦ , ϕ ∼ 50◦ ) and (θ ∼ 55◦ , ϕ ∼ −50◦ ) for band M4. These features could be
understood as a realization of static chirality, and hence give the lowest ∆E as shown in
Fig. 1(b).
For I = 15~, the peaks for band M1 move toward to (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ ∼ 90◦ ) and (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ ∼

−90◦ ), namely in the il-plane and close to i-axis. This is mainly driven by the gradual
increasing of i-components of the rotor, and valence neutron g9/2 particle, and valence proton
f7/2 hole angular momenta, as presented in Fig. 2. The peaks for the azimuthal plot for band
M4 locate at (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ ∼ 60◦ ) and (θ ∼ 60◦ , ϕ ∼ −60◦ ). At this spin, bands M1 and M4
attain vibration character again, which is now with respect to il-plane. As a consequence,
their energy difference ∆E, as shown in Fig. 1(b), increases [69, 70].
To further understand the evolution of the chirality with spin, in Fig. 4, the K-plots, i.e.,
K-distributions for the angular momentum on the l-, i-, and s- axes calculated by PRM for
the doublet bands M1 and M4 in

60

Ni are displayed. As seen in the figures, the evolutions

of the rotational modes from no chirality at I = 9-11~, to the chiral vibration at I = 12~,
then to the static chirality at I = 13-14~, and finally to the second vibration at I = 15~ are
exhibited clearly.

FIG. 4: The K-plots, i.e., K-distributions for the angular momentum on the long (l-), intermediate
(i), and short (s-) axes calculated by PRM for the doublet bands M1 and M4 in

60 Ni.

For I = 9-11~, the peaks of Kl locate around Kl = 6~ for band M1, while at Kl = 1~
for band M4. The Ki -distribution peaks at Ki = 1~ for band M1, while spreads widely
for band M4. The Ks -distributions of both bands peak at large Ks value. All of these are
in accordance with the features observed in the azimuthal plots shown in Fig. 3. Namely,
the angular momentum of band M1 stays within the sl-plane, while that of band M4 aligns
along s-axis.
For I = 12~, Kl distribution of band M4 shows a rapid change, which is caused by the
discontinuous variation of the l-component of rotor angular momentum, as shown in Fig. 2.
The Ki -distribution spreads around Ki = 0 for band M1, whereas it almost vanishes for
band M4. This is in accordance with the interpretation of the chiral vibration with respect
to the sl-plane where the zero-phonon state (band M1) is symmetric with respect to Ki = 0
and the one-phonon state (band M4) is antisymmetric.
For I = 13 and 14~, the Ki -distributions of bands M1 and M4 are rather similar. The
position of peak of Kl - (Ks ) distribution for band M1 is a bit smaller (larger) than those
for band M4. Such differences lead the different azimuthal plots shown in Fig. 3 and lead
that the energy splitting of bands M1 and M4 is a bit large (∼ 400 keV), though they are,
in fact, in the static chirality region.
For I = 15~, the Kl - and Ki - distributions for bands M1 and M4 are similar. However,
for the Ks -distribution, they are different. The most probable value spreads at Ks ∼ 1~ for
band M1, while appears at Ks ∼ 11~ for band M4. This further supports the appearance
of second chiral vibration with respect to il-plane.
9

In summary, the open problem on whether or not the chirality exists in doublet bands M1
and M4 in light-mass even-even nucleus

60

Ni is studied by adopting the recently developed

fully quantal four-j shells triaxial particle rotor model. The corresponding experimental energy spectra, energy differences between the doublet bands, and the available B(M1)/B(E2)
values are successfully reproduced. The analyses based on the angular momentum components, the azimuthal plots, and the K-plots suggest that the chiral modes exist at I ≥ 12~.
Namely, there is no indication of chirality at I ≤ 11~. A chiral vibration appears at I = 12~,
then changes to nearly static chirality at I = 14~, and finally evolves to another type of
chiral vibration at I = 15~.
Further experimental efforts on extending the level scheme and extracting electromagnetic
transition data for band M4 are highly demanded to obtain solid evidence. According to
current investigation, we would also like to attract more experimental and theoretical efforts
on the investigation of chirality or multiple chirality in the A ∼ 60 mass region and even in
the lighter-mass region.
