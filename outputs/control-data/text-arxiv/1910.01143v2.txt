We explore the role of atomic correlations in a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate
coupled to a dissipative cavity, where both the atoms and the cavity are blue detuned from the
external pumping laser. Using a genuine many-body approach that goes beyond mean-field, we
extract density distributions and many-body correlations to unveil a pathway to chaos at large
pump power through a hierarchical self-organization of the atoms, where the atoms transition from
a single-well optical lattice to a double-well optical lattice. Correlated states of the atoms emerge and
are characterized by local superfluid correlations in phases which are globally superfluid or Mott
insulating. Local superfluid-Mott transitions are precluded by a dynamical instability to chaos
which occurs via quasiperiodic attractors. Our results explain the mechanism behind the dynamical
instabilities observed in experiments.

Introduction - Experimental advances in the past
decade have heralded a new era in light-matter hybrid
systems, where quantum light is used to engineer correlated phases of matter. In the solid state realm, coupling to light has been used to activate phases of matter
like ferroelectricity [1] and superconductivity [2]. In the
quantum engineering domain, cavity-QED systems with
their tunable light matter couplings provide a versatile
platform to realize hybrid correlated quantum fluids like
polaritons [3, 4], permit the encoding of qubits through
photons [5], and generate entangled quantum many-body
states for quantum computation [6].
A landmark example of a light induced phase is superradiance [7–10] in strongly coupled cavity-Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) systems where the atoms in the BEC
self-organize onto a lattice dynamically generated by the
cavity field [11–13]. Cavity-BEC systems also host complex phases like Mott insulators [14–18], supersolids [19–
21], and spin textures [22–26]. They additionally allow the simulation of many-body Hamiltonians having
no solid-state counterparts, like spin models with both
short and long range interactions [2, 27], and the realization of exotic collective magnetic phenomena [28].
Prior theoretical work highlighted the ability of bluedetuned cavity-atom system to stabilize limit cycles and
chaos [30, 31]. Though the predicted limit cycles were
not seen in the first experimental study of this regime,
interesting dynamical instabilities was reported [32]. Motivated by this study, we go beyond Refs. [30, 31] and explore the atomic correlations and dynamical instabilities
in a realistic harmonically trapped cavity-BEC system
[Fig. 1(a)], and map the rich phase diagram in Fig. 1(b).
On the pathway to chaos, we reveal an unexpected hierarchical deformation of the optical lattice into a doublewell lattice, which generates new correlated phases of the
atoms. In the dynamically unstable regime, we also observe that quasiperiodicity dominates instead of strict
periodicity, which is compatible to experiments. Our
proposed phase diagram and methodology is relevant for

different experimental realizations like in Refs. [12], [14],
and [33].
Model and method - We consider a cavity-BEC system with N bosonic atoms of mass m. From a computational perspective, since the physics of the system
does not qualitatively depend on the dimensionality, we
study a one-dimensional version of the model and later
discuss the validity of the results obtained for the twodimensional system. In the rotating frame of the pump
laser, the system is described by the following coupled
equations of motion for the cavity expectation value α
and the atomic field operators Ψ̂(†) (x) [11, 34]:

∂t α = (i∆c − iN U0 B − κ)α − iηN θ.

Here, kc is the wave vector of the cavity field and corresponds to the recoil frequency ωR ≡ ~kc2 /2m. g is the
weak interatomic interaction, U0 the atomic single photon light shift, η the effective pump rate, ∆c the cavity
detuning, and κ the cavity dissipation rate. The blue detuning of atoms and cavity is reflected in U0 and ∆c being
positive, respectively. The atoms are confined by a har2 2
monic trap Vtrap (x) = m
2 ωx x . Since we are interested
in regimes far from the normal–superradiant boundary,
the cavity is in a coherent state with negligible fluctuations [18, 35–37], and can thus be represented
by a

and B = dxρ(x) cos2 (kc x) in Eq.(1b) are the order parameters associated with superradiance, where ρ(x) =

The main characteristic features of the system are direct results of the cavity-induced potential. For our analytical considerations, we neglect the atomic interactions,
atomic correlations, and the harmonic trap, and adiabatically eliminate the cavity field via setting ∂t α = 0. We

system [39]. This analysis provides the first glimpse of
intrinsically different physics in the blue-detuned region.
Most phenomena in the blue-detuned cavity-BEC system, including the atomic self-organization, the doublewell lattice, and the dynamical instabilities, can be revealed by the evolution in the (B, θ) phase space in discretized time. The evolution can be found by noticing
that the instantaneous potential Eq. (2) is controlled by
the two order parameters from the past step, (Bt , θt ), and
subsequently determines the quantum state and thus the
parameters in the next step, (Bt+1 , θt+1 ). Using a Gaussian ansatz for the quantum states, the two parameters
are found to evolve following

Phase diagram. For cavity detuning 0 < δ < 1/2, the system
transitions from the normal phase to the dynamically unstable region via superradiance with increasing pump rate A ∝ η.
The strongly correlated phases are a self-organized superradiant (SSF), a self-organized Mott insulator (SMI), a selforganized dimerized superfluid (SDSF), and a self-organized
second-order superfluid (2-SSF) phase. The orange line delineates superfluid phases and globally Mott insulating phases,
while the green line marks the hierarchical self-organization
to dimerized phases. Pronounced sensitivity to the ramping
protocol is seen in the hatched dark green region. At higher
A, the system is dynamically unstable to the formation of
quasiperiodic attractors (QA) followed by chaos. The QAs
only exist in the region represented by the thick gray line,
while the thin dashed section represents a direct transition to
the chaos. The dimensionless detuning δ and the potential

with A = ηN U0 / [(∆c − N U0 B)2 + κ2 ]ωR the dimensionless overall effective potential strength and δ =

dynamically creates an optical lattice potential comprising two sinusoidal terms, cos2 (kc x) and cos(kc x), whose
amplitudes are determined by the instantaneous atomic
state via θ and B.
With blue-detuned atoms, U0 > 0, self-organization
takes place in both a red-detuned cavity δ < 0 and a
blue-detuned cavity 0 < δ < 1/2 [11, 12, 38]. In the
former case, the cos(kc x) term dominates and the atoms
are localized at the lattice sites xn = nπ/kc with all
n either even or odd. However, in the latter case, the
two terms in Vcav can be equally significant, forming a
local double well at each site. This double-well lattice can
realize the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in a cavity-fermion

Beyond the mean-field limit, the combination of the
double-well optical lattice and weak atomic interactions
results in hierarchical transitions to a series of correlated
phases of matter. We investigate the full phase diagram
described by Eq. (1) using the multi-configurational timedependent Hartree method for indistinguishable particles
(MCTDH-X) [40–45]. The simulated N = 50 atoms are
initialized in a Thomas-Fermi-like state, and the manybody state of the atoms coupled to the cavity is propagated in real time. The pump rate η is linearly ramped
up at fixed detunings to reach its desired value. The
simulation parameters correspond to those realized experimentally in Ref. [12] and are given in detail in the
supplementary material [29].
The phase diagram is extracted from the observables: θ, B, the position space density distribution
ρ(x), the momentum space density distribution ρ̃(k) =
hΨ̂† (k)Ψ̂(k)i/N , and the Glauber one-body
correlation
p
function g (1) (x, x0 ) = hΨ̂† (x)Ψ̂(x0 )i/ N 2 ρ(x)ρ(x0 ) [46,
47], whose behaviors are summarized in Fig. 2. The simulation results from MCTDH-X will be compared to the
analytical results from Eq. (3) [see Fig. 3].
Results - Our results for the blue-detuned cavity-BEC
are summarized in the phase diagram [Fig. 1(b)] along
with a schematic representation of the different phases
[Fig. 1(c)]. The system self-organizes at a critical pump
rate ηc roughly consistent
with the mean-field predic√
tion A(ηc ) = 1/ 1 − 2δ [11]. We plot ρ(x) and ρ̃(k)
at two representative detunings in Fig. 2(a)-(d). The
self-organized superfluid (SSF) phase is characterized by
a continuous density distribution ρ(x) with pronounced
peaks at the sites of the emergent lattice with spacing
λc = 2π/kc . The corresponding ρ̃(k), measurable by
time-of-flight experiments, is characterized by a principal

detunings δ = 0.14 and δ = 0.28. At lower detuning, δ = 0.14, the system starts from the normal phase and then enters the
SSF phase at A = 1.4, the SMI phase at A = 2.7, and the 2-SSF phase sequentially. At higher detuning δ = 0.28, the system
starts from the normal phase and then enters the SSF phase at A = 1.9, and the SDSF phase sequentially. The dotted lines are
guides to the eye. (e-j) The position and momentum space density distributions and the Glauber one-body correlation function

peak at the center k = 0 straddled by two satellite peaks
at k = ±kc stemming from the superfluid correlations
between the atoms at different lattice sites [14, 17, 18].
At lower detunings δ < 0.2 and larger pump rate, the system transitions from the superfluid into a self-organized
Mott insulator (SMI) phase. This phase is characterized by the disappearance of the peaks at k = ±kc and
the broadening of the central peak at k = 0 in ρ̃(k)
[Fig. 1(c)] [14, 18, 48–50]. The superfluid and Mott insulating phases are analogue to the ones in a standard BoseHubbard model [18]. In the (B, θ) phase space, these two
phases with single-well lattices are characterized by stable fixed points with B − δ > |θ| [Fig. 3(b,g)]. Such
phases always appear first as A passes a critical value
and the system leaves the normal phase (B = 1/2, θ = 0)
[Fig. 3(a,f)].
As the pump rate increases further, the fixed point in
the phase space moves. As B − δ becomes smaller than
|θ| [Fig. 3(c,h)], local double-well potentials are formed
at lattice sites according to Eq. (2). This is unique to
blue-detuned systems. Depending on the degree of correlations between the atoms at different sites, we obtain
either a self-organized dimerized superfluid (SDSF) where
global superfluid correlations persist across the doublewell dimers, or a self-organized second-order superfluid
(2-SSF) phase where superfluid correlations exist only
within each double-well dimer. The signatures of these
two states lie in the distributions ρ(x) and ρ̃(k) and the
correlation function g (1) (x, x0 ) as shown in Figs. 2(e)(j). The double-well optical lattice is confirmed by the
two-humped density distribution in ρ(x) at each lattice
site [Fig. 2(e,h)], and the concomitant reduction of the
one-body correlation from unity within one lattice site
[Fig. 2(g,j)]. Within each double-well dimer, local super-

fluidity exists and manifests itself as two peaks in ρ̃(k)
appearing at k = ±k ∗ [Fig. 2(f,i)], where
k∗ =

πkc
arccos[(B − δ)/|θ|]

(4)

corresponds to the distance between the minima of the
double-well potential. As the pump rate increases, k ∗
approaches 2kc from above and the peak height increases
as the double well becomes deeper.
In the SDSF (2-SSF) phase, global superfluid correlations between different pairs of double wells is present
(absent). This corresponds to the presence (absence) of
the peaks at kc in ρ̃(k) [Fig. 2(f,i)], and a finite (vanishing) correlation in g (1) between different lattice sites
[Fig. 2(g,j)]. In a 2-SSF state, superfluidity has a completely different length scale from the SSF and SDSF
states, since coherence exists only locally within each
double-well dimer. Although superfluidity usually refers
to long-range coherence, it can also be used to describe
coherence within a double well [51]. These two new
phases realize a variant of the Bose-Hubbard model with
degenerate double-well lattices with Hamiltonian

and (e,j) chaos at A = 17. (k) The trajectory of the fixed points as A changes. The solid blue and orange points are stable
fixed points for single-well and double-well lattices, respectively. The red empty points show the unstable fixed points. A blue
line is superposed to show the trajectory in MCTDH-X simulation in dynamically stable phases.

ior is seen across the boundary between SDSF and 2SSF phases, shown by the hatched dark green region in
Fig. 1(b). This implies a first-order transition between
the globally superfluid and the globally Mott insulating
phases.
At higher pump rates, the fixed points of Eq. (3) become unstable through a Hopf bifurcation [53, 54] as
attested by the trajectory and flow in Fig. 3(d,i), and
the appearance of dynamical instabilities in the cavityBEC system. Such instabilities preclude Mott insulation within a double well [Fig. 1(b)]. In the presence of the atomic interactions and the harmonic trap,
the limit cycles predicted in a non-interacting, trapless
system [30, 31] are reduced to quasiperiodic attractors
(QAs). Similar to the limit cycles, the QAs are shown
to be robust against ramping protocols in Figs. 4(a,b):
the trajectories are always confined in the same region
in the (B, θ) phase space [Fig. 4(b)], and they exhibit
roughly the same amplitude and frequency profile of oscillations [Fig. 4(a)]. In contrast to limit cycles, QAs
are highly sensitive to initial conditions, reflecting their
connection to chaos. Nevertheless, the double-well configuration of the atomic density is well preserved in a QA
state [Fig. 4(c)].
As the pump rate further increases, the discretizedtime model predicts θ and thereby the optical lattice
will repeatedly vanish transiently [Fig. 3(e,j)]. In the
cavity-BEC system, the atoms become loosely confined
and higher momentum modes are easily excited, leading to a rapid increase in system energy and resulting in
full chaos and thermalization [Fig. 4(d)]. In this thermalized regime, the atomic density distribution eventually becomes completely fluctuative and the system becomes fully chaotic [Fig. 4(c)]. Tightly trapped systems
are more prone to thermalization [29].
Discussion and extension to 2D systems - In terms of
the renormalized parameters δ and A [cf. Eq. (2)], the

phase diagram is rather general and relevant for multiple
experimental setups [12, 33, 55]. At the mean-field level,
we have seen that the discretized mapping Eq. (3) qualitatively predicts various phenomena observed in simulations. In addition, its fixed points also roughly track the
simulated system trajectory in phase space [Fig. 3(k)].
We now discuss the dependence of the phase diagram
on the atom number N and the trap. There are two
kinds of phase boundaries in Fig. 1(b): mean-field and
non-mean-field. The first kind (NP-SSF and dynamical
stability boundaries) is governed by the cavity-induced
effective potential in Eq. (2), which solely depends on δ
and A. Thus, these phase boundaries, given as functions
of δ and A, remain unchanged for any particle number
and are only weakly sensitive to the trap [18]. The second
kind delineates the phases SSF, SMI, 2-SSF and SDSF.
These transitions are driven by Bose-Hubbard physics
and are determined by the filling factor at lattice sites.
As N increases and the harmonic trap tightens, the filling factor increases and these phase boundaries move towards larger A. Based on these observations, we have
made a computationally judicious choice of particle number and trapping frequency to effectively simulate the
experimentally relevant phase diagram.
The phase diagram for the one-dimensional system can
be straightforwardly extended to the experimentally relevant two-dimensional systems. In this case, the atoms are
subject to three light-induced effective potentials which
we require to be:
Vlight (x, y) = ~η 2 /U0 cos2 (kc y) + ~U0 |α|2 cos2 (kc x)
+~η(α + α∗ ) cos(kc x) sin(kc y).
(6)
Compared to the one-dimensional version [Eq. (1a)],
the first term is an additional term stemming from
the transverse pumping laser.
The cavity field
α follows the equation of motion Eq. (1b), where
the lattice order parameter is generalized to θ =

to the effective potential realized very recently in experiment [32], the essential difference in the above system
[Eq. (6)] is an extra phase shift of π/2 along the pump
(y) axis in the last term. This phase shift is necessary to
observe our phase diagram and can straightforwardly be
implemented in the experimental setup.

FIG. 4: (a) The order parameter θ as a function of time for
three different ramping protocols from the stable region into
the quasiperiodic attractor (QA) phase (δ = 0.14, A = 11.8).
In the blue and green trajectories, the detuning is fixed at δ =
0.14 and the pump rate A ∝ η is ramped up linearly at rates of
(blue) dA/dt = 4 × 10−4 ωR and (green) dA/dt = 8 × 10−5 ωR ,
respectively. In the orange trajectory, the pump rate is fixed
at A = 11.8 and the detuning is ramped up linearly at a rate
of dδ/dt = 1.5 × 10−4 ωR . (b) For all three cases, the system
converges to the same attractor in the (B, θ) phase space. (c)

space density distribution ρ(x, y) of (e) a single-well lattice
state and (f) a double-well lattice state in a two-dimensional
cavity-BEC system as described by Eq. (6).

The two-dimensional system is expected to qualitatively possess the same phase diagram shown in Fig. 1(b).
All the phases should be accessible for reasonable values
of the detuning and pump rate. In Figs. 4(e,f), we plot
two representative examples of spatial density distributions based on mean-field simulations, i) the standard
self-organization on a checkerboard lattice corresponding
to an SSF or SMI, and ii) self-organization on the doublewell optical lattice structures. The latter would lead to
extra peaks in momentum space at k = (±k ∗ , 0) superposed over the underlying superfluid or Mott-insulator
momentum distribution, which serves as the smokinggun evidence of dimerization in experiment. The oscillatory phase reminiscent of our quasiperiodic attractors has
already been observed experimentally [32]. Despite the
phase shift between the experimental setup and the one
discussed in this work, we expect the same mechanism
driving the dynamical instabilities. To clearly observe
the quasiperiodicity in an experiment, a loose trap along
the cavity axis with ωx ∼ 10−3 ωR is suggested [29].
Our work illustrates the potential of blue detuning to
realize exotic phases of matter and should stimulate future studies of complex cavity-cold atom platforms.

MULTICONFIGURATIONAL TIME-DEPENDENT HARTREE METHOD

In this work, the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for indistinguishable particles [1–4] (encoded
in the software MCTDH-X [5, 6]) is used to evolve the system’s state. This algorithm is able to solve a Hamiltonian
with a one-body potential V (x) and a two-body interaction W (x, x0 ),

where ψi (x; t) are the wave functions of the individual working orbitals. The state is evolved by propagating the
coefficients Cn (t) and the working orbitals ψi (x; t) using the time-dependent variational principle [7].
In MCTDH-X, the number of orbitals M is important to obtain converged results, especially of correlation functions [2, 3, 8]. With a single orbital M = 1, the method reproduces the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field limit; while with
infinitely many orbitals M → ∞, the method is numerically exact. To simulate a Mott insulating state, the number
of required orbitals is usually the same as the number of lattice sites [9]. In our case, considering that there are three
lattice sites and each site splits into two sub-sites, M = 6 orbitals are needed in total to fully capture the atomic
correlations. However, due to the amount of computational time needed, the simulations are performed with M = 3
orbitals or M = 4 orbitals when specified. In the latter case, we are able to observe the effect of the correlation
induced dimerization on the one-body correlation function inside the central lattice site, as shown in Fig. 2(g,j) in the
main text. We expect that with M = 6 orbitals, reduction of correlation from unity can also be seen in the other two
lattice sites.
II.

SYSTEM PARAMETERS

The parameters used in this work are inspired by the experimental setup in Ref. [10]. We simulate a total number of
N = 50 87 Rb atoms with mass m = 1.44 × 10−25 kg and one-dimensional contact interaction N g = 1.0 × 10−17 eV · m.
The wavelength of the laser pump and the cavity field is chosen as λc = 784nm, and therefore the recoil frequency is
ωR = 2π ×3734Hz. The collective photon light shift is given by N U0 = 28.9ωR = 2π ×108kHz, and the cavity detuning
takes the values between ∆c = 0 and ∆c = N U0 /2 = 2π × 54kHz. The maximum pump rate is η = 2π × 825kHz, this
corresponds to an overall effective potential strength of A = 12 [cf. Eq.(2) in the main text]. The cavity dissipation

2
rate is chosen to be large enough κ = 700ωR = 2π × 2.60MHz such that the system operates in the bad-cavity limit.
We note that the numerical simulations can also be done for less dissipative cavities. The harmonic trap confining
the atoms has a trapping frequency of ωx = 0.136ωR = 2π × 504Hz in most of the simulations, but looser traps with
ωx = 0.068ωR = 2π × 252Hz and ωx = 0.0068ωR = 2π × 25.2Hz are also used to analyze the quasiperiodic attractor
phase.
III.

DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS FOR θ AND B IN DISCRETIZED TIME

The dynamical behavior of the system can already be captured by the evolution of the parameters θ and B. These
two parameters are chosen because they enter the effective Hamiltonian [cf. Eq.(2) in the main text] and they quantify
the self-organization. The discrete dynamical map governing the evolution of these two parameters can be derived
based on the effective one-body potential, Eq. (2) in the main text:
Ĥ (1) = −

~∂x2
+ A2 ~ωR [2(δ − B)θ cos(kc x) + θ2 cos2 (kc x)].
2m

(S5)

Due to the driven-dissipative nature of the system, the atoms are subject to an effective potential which is determined
by the atomic distribution itself through θ and B. On the other hand, once the instantaneous effective potential is
known, we are able to solve the ground state of the Hamiltonian, which will give a new pair of parameters θ and B.
In this way, we are able to obtain discretized evolution equations for these two parameters.
We suppose that at step t, the parameters are given by θt and Bt . When B − δ ≥ |θ| > 0, the minima of the
effective potential lie at xn = 2nπ/kc [xn = (2n + 1)π/kc ], n ∈ N, for positive (negative) θ. In the vicinity of the
minima, the effective potential can be expanded into a quadratic form
Vt (x = xn + δx) = ~ωR A2 |θt |(Bt − δ − |θt |)kc2 δx2 ≡

m 2 2
$ δx .

The atomic density distribution at the next step can immediately be written down using the Gaussian ansatz for the
ground state:

Therefore,
the parameters θ and
R∞
R ∞B at the next step can be calculated according to their definitions, θt+1 =
cos(kc x)ρt (x) and Bt+1 = −∞ cos2 (kc x)ρt (x), respectively. According to the aforementioned ansatz of the
−∞
density distribution, these are given explicitly by

We note that $t defined here and Ωt from the main text are related through Ω2t = m$t2 /~kc .
When B − δ ≥ |θ| < 0, the cavity-induced potential forms a double-well lattice, but the evolution equations for θ
and B can be found in a similar manner as above. The results are summarized in Eq. (3) of the main text.
IV.

CROSSOVER OR TRANSITION TO SDSF AND 2-SSF PHASES

To investigate if the spontaneous deformation to the double-well lattice signifies a transition or a crossover, we
choose the height of the peak at k = k ∗ in momentum space as the relevant order parameter,
(
0,
B − δ ≥ |θ|
(S9)
ξ=
ρ̃(k ∗ ), B − δ < |θ|,
where k ∗ = πkc / arccos[(B − δ)/|θ|]. This ad hoc order parameter ξ as a function of A at two different detunings
δ = 0.14 and δ = 0.28 is shown in Fig. S1. As discussed in the main text, for δ = 0.14 the system enters the
normal phase (NP), the self-organized superfluid (SSF) phase, the self-organized Mott insulator (SMI) phase and the
self-organized second-order superfluid phase (2-SSF) phase sequentially. In the latter case, the system enters the NP,
SSF phase and self-organized dimerized superfluid (SDSF) phase sequentially.

FIG. S1: The dimerization order parameter ξ [Eq. (S9)] and θ − B + δ as functions of pump rate at different detunings (a)
δ = 0.14 and (b) δ = 0.28. The dimerization order parameter ξ is multiplied by a factor of N = 50 such that it is in the same
√
order of magnitude as θ − B + δ. The dimensionless potential strength A is given with respect to ωR .

In both cases, ξ gains a tiny finite value as soon as θ > B − δ, as the effective potential [Eq. (2) in the main text]
at each lattice site evolves from a single well into a double well. However, at δ = 0.14, ξ increases slowly at first in
the SSF and SMI phases and then it increases rapidly after entering the 2-SSF phase. The onset of the rapid increase
(A ≈ 9) roughly traces the boundary between the SMI and 2-SSF phases. On the contrary, at δ = 0.28, the increase
in ξ is almost negligible. It is more likely that the system undergoes a crossover between the SSF and SDSF phases
and there is no clear boundary between these two phases.
Tracing through the green line indicating the dimerization transition in the phase diagram [Fig. 1(b) in the main
text], we observe two different transition behaviors depending on the existence of the global superfluidity. When the
detuning is large and the system is globally superfluid, a crossover is likely to take place; while when the detuning is
small and the system is globally Mott insulating, a second order transition is likely to take place. A firm conclusion
can be drawn only after more detailed examination, including the dependence of the transition behaviors on atom
number and orbital number.
V.

HYSTERESIS IN ATOMIC CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO DIMERIZED PHASES

We now analyze the hatched dark green region separating the self-organized dimerized superfluid (SDSF) phase and
the self-organized second-order superfluid (2-SSF) phase in Fig. 1(b) in the main text. A systematic analysis shows
that the correlations of the system hardly converge close to the boundary between the SDSF and 2-SSF phases. The
height of the central peak in the momentum space density distribution ρ̃(k = 0) has been shown in the literature to
serve as a simple and useful indicator of the correlations between the atoms [11–13]. In Fig. S2, we fix the pump rate
at three different values and ramp the cavity detuning back and forth across the SDSF - 2SSF boundary at different
ramping rates. At small pump rate A = 2.9 [Fig. S2(a)], the system is still in the SSF phase and no hysteresis exists
even for the fastest ramp. At higher pump rate A = 4.4 [Fig. S2(b)], the system enters the SDSF phase and the
2SSF phase at high and low detunings, respectively. A hysteresis in ρ̃(k = 0) can be clearly seen in a fast ramping.
However, the hysteresis area becomes much smaller as the ramping slows down. At an even higher pump rate A = 5.9
[Fig. S2(c)] where the system is approaching the thermalized phase, the hysteresis is prominent, and the hysteresis
area does not vanish even for the slowest ramping. Our results indicate that the SDSF–2-SSF transition could be a
first-order transition.
VI.

SENSITIVITY OF THE QUASIPERIODIC ATTRACTOR TO THE HARMONIC TRAP AND THE
ATOMIC FLUCTUATIONS

The presence of trapping and atomic interactions have large impact on the transition to chaos. The quasiperiodic
attractor (QA) is highly susceptible to the harmonic trap and atomic fluctuations. To quantify the dynamical instability in the system, we propagate the system to the desired pump rate using different ramp-up times. We then

(b) A = 4.4, and (c) A = 5.9. The ramping is performed at different rates, where the fastest ramp is performed within a
time interval of t = 13.6/ωR (solid lines), the medium ramp within t = 40.7/ωR (dashed lines), and the slowest ramp within
t = 67.8/ωR (dotted lines). The dimensionless cavity detuning δ is given with respect to N U0 .

FIG. S3: Measurement of the variance of the order parameter ∆θ [Eq. (S10)] over time as the system is propagated at different

where the bar means average in time. For comparison, these propagations are performed with different values of the
harmonic trapping frequency, both in the mean-field limit [Fig. S3(a)] and beyond mean-field [Fig. S3(b)]. We find
that a looser trap shifts the boundary between the stable and unstable region towards higher pump rates and also
widens the QA region. In the mean-field limit, as the trap loosens, the width of the QA region (∆A) becomes wider.
We compare our results with the mean-field results in Ref. [14], where N U0 = 12.1ωR , κ = 10ωR and the trap is
absent. At the same detuning δ √
= 0.4, i.e. ∆c = δN U0 = 4.84ωR , the limit cycle region has been predicted to take
place between roughly between η N = 8.5ωR and 11ωR . This corresponds to roughly A = 3.0 and 3.8. The QA region
shrinks even further as we turn on the atomic fluctuations. Particularly, with the tight trapping, ωx /ωR = 0.136, the
QA region between the SDSF phase and the thermalized region vanishes completely. In conclusion, the quasiperiodic

5
attractors are extremely susceptible to the atomic fluctuations and the harmonic trap frequency. A tight trap can
drive the quasiperiodic attractors into chaos. In experiments, a loose trap with ωx ∼ 10−3 ωR is recommended for the
observation of the quasiperiodic attractors.

FIG. S4: The trajectory of the system projected on the basis {hcos(kc x)i, hcos(2kc x)i, hcos(3kc x)i} (a) before thermalization
and (b) both before and after thermalization. In panel (b), the color scheme shows the time. The trajectory evolves starting
from the orange region and ending in the yellow region. The simulation is performed with M = 3 at detuning δ = 0.18.

Apart from the density distribution and the system energy, the quasiperiodic attractor phase and the thermalized
phase also differ vastly in their trajectory in the phase space. Particularly, such difference is more pronounced in the
high-dimensional phase space. We thus expand the density distribution in the basis {hcos(kc x)i = θ, hcos(2kc x)i =
2B − 1, hcos(3kc x)i, hcos(4kc x)i, . . . }. The projections of the trajectory onto the first three basis vectors hcos(kc x)i,
hcos(2kc x)i, and hcos(3kc x)i in the quasiperiodic attractor regime and the chaotic regime are shown in Fig. S4.
Fig. S4(a) shows the system trajectory before thermalization. The oscillation along the third direction hcos(3kc x)i
has a significant dependence on the oscillation along the first two directions. To analyze such a dependence, we perform
principle component analysis (PCA) on the projection on the first six basis vectors hcos(kc x)i, . . . , hcos(6kc x)i. The
eigenvalues of the six components are λ1 = 0.12, λ2 = 0.02, λ3 = 0.01, λ4 = 0.004, λ5 = 7 × 10−4 , λ6 = 9 × 10−5 . The
fast decrease in these eigenvalues suggests that the quasiperiodic attractor is essentially a “limit tube” in the Hilbert
space.
Fig. S4(b) shows the system trajectory both before and after thermalization. After the system becomes thermalized,
the system trajectory moves to a completely different part of phase space. In this scenario, the eigenvalues of the
six components in PCA analysis are λ1 = 0.071, λ2 = 0.034, λ3 = 0.032, λ4 = 0.025, λ5 = 0.021, λ6 = 0.017.
The decrease in the eigenvalues is much slower than the previous case, suggesting a high trajectory dimension. The
significant difference between the quasiperiodic attractor regime and the chaotic regime reassures that they belong to
two dynamical phases.

BIFURCATION RELATED TO THE DYNAMICAL INSTABILITIES

The evolution of the system in discretized time and in the (B, θ) phase space is described by Eq. (3) of the main
text. It also helps for investigating the nature of the bifurcation in the cavity-BEC system. The dynamical behavior
of a system can be studied by linearization in the vicinity of the fixed point, which is performed via the Jacobian

FIG. S5: (a) The modulus of the eigenvalue of the Jacobian |λ1 | as a function of A. As A increases, it grows from below 1
where the fixed point is stable (solid points) to above 1 where the fixed point becomes unstable (empty points). In particular,
it reaches |λ1 | = 1 at roughly A = 11, where the system undergoes a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. The detuning takes the
value of δ = 0.14. (b) The mean-field phase diagram obtained by (solid lines) the discretized time analysis, and (dashed lines)
MCTDH-X simulations. The simulation results are reproduced from Fig. 1(b) of the main text. The blue lines show the
boundary between the normal phase (NP) and the superradiant phase (SP), while the red lines separate the dynamically stable
and unstable regions. For small detunings δ < 0.3, the system behaviors are qualitatively the same between the discretized time
analysis and the simulations. For large detunings δ > 0.3, the discretized time analysis predicts that the system will become
dynamically unstable as soon as it enters the SP. The dimensionless detuning δ and the potential strength A are normalized
√
with respect to N U0 and ωR , respectively.

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian are denoted as λ1 and λ2 . After the formation of the double-well lattice with
δ − B < |θ|, we find that the two eigenvalues are complex conjugates λ1 = λ∗2 , indicating a spiral fixed point. In a
discretized system, a spiral fixed point goes from stable to unstable as the moduli of its eigenvalue |λ1 | = |λ2 | passes
through 1 from below to above. This is called a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation [15, 16], whose conterpart in continuous
time is the Hopf bifurcation [17, 18]. In our model, for detuning δ = 0.14, the bifurcation take place at roughly A = 11
[Fig. S5(a)]. Such a bifurcation always takes place when |θ| > B − δ and is thus closely related to the formation of
double-well lattices.
As we recall from the main text, the normal–superradiant boundary and the dynamically stable–unstable boundary
are solely driven by the cavity-induced potential and can be fully treated in the mean-field limit. This indicates
that the discretized mapping should also fully capture these two boundaries. In Fig. S5(b), we compare these two
boundaries obtained from the discretized system and the simulation results of the cavity-BEC system by MCTDH-X.
Indeed, the two results roughly agree with each other, especially at small detunings.
