Abstract
During the last two decades, we easily see that the World Wide Web’s link structure is
modeled as the directed graph. In this paper, we will model the World Wide Web’s link
structure as the directed hypergraph. Moreover, we will develop the PageRank algorithm
for this directed hypergraph. Due to the lack of the World Wide Web directed hypergraph
datasets, we will apply the PageRank algorithm to the metabolic network which is the
directed hypergraph itself. The experiments show that our novel PageRank algorithm is
successfully applied to this metabolic network.

1 Introduction
With the quick growth of the World Wide Web during the last two decades, information retrieval
introduces growing theoretical and practical challenges. With the huge amount of information
inflowing the World Wide Web every second, it becomes more difficult and more difficult to
retrieve information from the Web. This explains why the existence of a search engine is as
important as the existence of the web itself. Since the appearance of the web, there has been a

fundamental talk in the web research community to develop the rapid, effective, and precise search
engines.
This paper will be chiefly discussing about the most common search engine nowadays which is
Google. The mathematical theory behind the Google search engine is the PageRank algorithm,
which was presented by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page [1]. In 1998, Brin and Page were PhD
students at Stanford University, USA. Then they took a leave of absence from their Ph.D. to
concentrate on developing their Google model. Their original paper describing the PageRank
algorithm is used nowadays by Google to create the rankings of the web pages of the World Wide
Web.
A search engine contains three important modules: a crawler, and an indexer, and a query engine
[2]. The crawler gathers and stores data from the web. Data is stored in the indexer which mines
information from the data gathered from the crawler. The query engine responds to the queries
from customers. The PageRank algorithm (i.e. one of the ranking algorithms), part of the query
engine, ranks the web pages in the order of their “importance” to the query. The ranking is attained
by the contribution of a score to each web page of the World Wide Web.
PageRank is a ranking algorithm of web pages of the World Wide Web. The PageRank algorithm
exploits the link structure of the web. The World Wide Web's link structure forms a directed graph
where the web pages are the nodes of the directed graph and the links are the directed edges of the
directed graph. The web page (i.e. the node of the directed graph) is considered "important" if it
is pointed to by other “important” web pages.
During the last two decades, we easily recognized that the World Wide Web’s link structure was
modeled as the directed graph. Moreover, the PageRank algorithm was developed for this directed
graph only. In general, this model, the directed graph, is not the best and the generalized model
for the World Wide Web’s link structure. In this paper, we will model the World Wide Web’s link
structure as the directed hypergraph [3, 4]. This work, to the best of our knowledge, has not been
investigated up to now. However, due to the lack of the World Wide Web directed hypergraph
datasets, we will exploit the metabolic network dataset that is available from [5]. This metabolic
network can easily be represented as the directed graph or the directed hypergraph. We will show
clearly how to construct the directed graph and the directed hypergraph from this metabolic
network. Then our next task is to develop the PageRank algorithm for the directed hypergraph.
This is the novel work. Moreover, we will define the un-normalized and the symmetric normalized
directed hypergraph Laplacian in this paper. In the future, if the World Wide Web’s directed
hypergraph datasets are available, then the directed hypergraph Laplacian based semi-supervised
learning will be developed in order to solve the spam detection problem. We can easily see that
the applications of the directed hypergraph are huge.
We will organize the paper as follows: Section 2 will introduce the preliminary notations and
definitions used in this paper. Section 3 will introduce the PageRank algorithm for the directed
hypergraph. Section 4 will introduce the definitions of the un-normalized and symmetric
normalized directed hypergraph Laplacian and their applications. Section 5 will show the
experimental results. Section 6 will conclude this paper and discuss the future direction of
researches.
2 Preliminary notations and definitions

Given the directed hypergraph 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of hyperarcs. Each hyper-arc 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸 is written as 𝑒 = (𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 , 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 ). The vertices of e are denoted by 𝒆 =
𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ∪ 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 . 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 is called the tail of the hyper-arc e and 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 is called the head of the hyperarc e. Please note that 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ≠ ∅, 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 ≠ ∅, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ∩ 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 = ∅.
The directed hypergraph 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸) can be represented by two incidence matrices 𝐻 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 and
𝐻 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 .
These two incidence matrices 𝐻 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 and 𝐻 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 can be defined as follows
𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙
ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ) = {1 𝑖𝑓 𝑣 ∈ 𝑒
0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑
ℎ𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 ) = {1 𝑖𝑓 𝑣 ∈ 𝑒
0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
Let 𝑤(𝑒) be the weight of the hyper-arc e. Let W be the diagonal matrix containing the weights
of hyper-arcs in its diagonal entries.
From the above definitions, we can define the tail and head degrees of the vertex v and the tail
and head degrees of the hyper-arc e as follows
𝑑 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑣) = ∑ 𝑤(𝑒)ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 )
𝑒∈𝐸

𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑒)

= ∑ ℎ𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 )
𝑣∈𝑉

Let 𝐷𝑣𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 , 𝐷𝑣𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 , 𝐷𝑒𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 , and 𝐷𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 be four diagonal matrices containing the tail and head
degrees of vertices and the tail and head degrees of hyper-arcs in their diagonal entries
respectively. Please note that 𝐷𝑣𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 and 𝐷𝑣𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 are the 𝑅 |𝑉|∗|𝑉| matrices and 𝐷𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 and 𝐷𝑒𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙
are the 𝑅 |𝐸|∗|𝐸| matrices.
3 PageRank algorithm for directed hypergraph
From [4], we know that the transition probability of the random walk on directed hypergraph can
be defined as follows
ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ) ℎ𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 )
𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) = ∑ 𝑤(𝑒)
𝑑 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢)
𝑑 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑒)
𝑒∈𝐸

From the above definition, the transition probability matrix P of the random walk on the directed
hypergraph can be defined as follows
−1
−1
𝑇
𝑃 = 𝐷𝑣𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 𝐻 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 𝑊𝐷𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝐻 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑
Next, we need to prove that the row sum of P is 1.
We have that

∑ 𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) = ∑ ∑ 𝑤(𝑒)
𝑣∈𝑉

𝑣∈𝑉 𝑒∈𝐸

ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ) ℎ𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 )
𝑑 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢)
𝑑𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑒)

ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 )

= ∑ 𝑤(𝑒)
∑ ℎ𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑣, 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 )
𝑑 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢) 𝑑𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝑒)
𝑒∈𝐸

𝑣∈𝑉

ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 )
= ∑ 𝑤(𝑒)
𝑑 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢)
𝑒∈𝐸
1
= 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙
∑ 𝑤(𝑒)ℎ𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 (𝑢, 𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 )
𝑑 (𝑢)
𝑒∈𝐸

=1
So, we easily see that 𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) ≥ 0, ∀𝑢, 𝑣 and ∑𝑣∈𝑉 𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) = 1 , ∀𝑣. Then we can conclude that
P is the stochastic matrix. Following the work from [1], the PageRank vector 𝜋 of the directed
hypergraph is the left dominant eigenvector of the transition probability matrix P of the random
walk on the directed hypergraph. In the other words, the PageRank vector 𝜋 of the directed
hypergraph is the solution of the following equation
𝜋𝑇 = 𝜋𝑇 𝑃
Moreover, we know that the above equation can easily be solved by the Power method.
4 Directed hypergraph Laplacian
In this section, we give two novel definitions of the directed hypergraph Laplacian which are unnormalized directed hypergraph Laplacian and symmetric normalized directed hypergraph
Laplacian.
Let S be the diagonal matrix containing all elements of PageRank vector 𝜋 of the directed
hypergraph in its diagonal entries.
The un-normalized directed hypergraph Laplacian can be defined as follows

The symmetric normalized directed hypergraph Laplacian can be defined as follows

From these two definitions, we can develop the directed hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps
algorithms, the spectral directed hypergraph clustering algorithms, and the directed hypergraph
Laplacian based semi-supervised learning algorithms. These are our future works.

5 Experiments and Results
Datasets
Due to the lack of the World Wide Web directed hypergraph datasets, we use the metabolic
network dataset that is available from [5]. This metabolic network is itself the directed hypergraph.
Thus, we don’t need to transform it to the directed hypergraph. This metabolic network contains
72 metabolites (i.e. nodes of the directed hypergraph) and 95 reactions (i.e. hyper-arcs of the
directed hypergraph). However, in the experiment, we just use 50 metabolites that are both in the

head AND in the tail of some hyper-arcs. In the other words, we can avoid the case that the tail
degree OR the head degree of the metabolite is zero. Moreover, we just use 75 reactions that the
tail degree AND the head degree of the hyper-arc are not zero. In the other words, we set that
𝑒 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 ≠ ∅ AND 𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 ≠ ∅.
Finally, we have the metabolic network (i.e. the directed hypergraph dataset) that has 50
metabolites (i.e. nodes of the dataset) and 75 reactions (i.e. hyper-arcs of the dataset).
Experiments
In the experiment, we initially construct 𝐻 𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 and 𝐻 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 matrices. Then we can construct
𝐷𝑣𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 , 𝐷𝑣𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 , 𝐷𝑒𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑙 , and 𝐷𝑒𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑 matrices. Finally, we can compute the transition probability
matrix P of the random walk on the directed hypergraph.
In order to obtain the PageRank vector of the directed hypergraph, we compute the left dominant
eigenvector of the matrix P. The following table 1 and table 2 show the 10 highest rank values of
10 metabolites in the directed hypergraph and the names of these 10 metabolites that have highest
ranks.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we develop the PageRank algorithm for the directed hypergraph. We successfully
apply it to the metabolic network which is the directed hypergraph itself. This is the novel work
not only in web mining field but also in bio-informatics field. In the future, we will develop the
directed hypergraph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning in order to solve the spam detection
problem since two directed hypergraph Laplacian was defined in this paper.
Moreover, in the future, we will also try to develop the directed hypergraph p-Laplacian semisupervised learning method. This method is worth investigated because of its hard nature and its
close connection to PDE on directed hypergraph field.
