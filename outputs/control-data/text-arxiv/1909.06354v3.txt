Abstract
We prove that for all graphs with at most (3.75 ‚àí o(1))n edges there exists a 2coloring of the edges such that every monochromatic path has order less than n. This
was previously known to be true for graphs with at most 2.5n ‚àí 7.5 edges. We also
improve on the best-known lower bounds in the r-color case.

Introduction

Given a graph H, let RÃÇr (H) be the minimum m such that there exists a graph G with
m edges such that in every r-coloring of G, there is a monochromatic copy of H. When
r = 2, we drop the subscript and just write RÃÇ(H). We refer to RÃÇ(H) as the size-Ramsey
number of H.
Let Pn be the path with n vertices. ErdoÃãs [16] famously asked if RÃÇ(Pn )/n ‚Üí ‚àû and
RÃÇ(Pn )/n2 ‚Üí 0. Beck [7] proved that in fact, RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â§ 900n (for n sufficiently large). The
bound 900n was subsequently improved in [10], [11], [13], [22] and currently rests at 74n
as proved by Dudek and Pralat in [14].
As for the lower bound, it is clear that RÃÇ(Pn ) > 2n ‚àí 4 since Pn has n ‚àí 1 edges. Beck
[7] proved RÃÇ(P‚àön ) ‚â• (9/4‚àío(1))n, Bielak [9] proved RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â• 9n/4‚àí3, BollobaÃÅs [10] proved
RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â• (1 + 2 ‚àí o(1))n, and finally Dudek and Pralat [14] proved RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â• 5n/2 ‚àí 15/2.
The closest thing there is to a conjecture about the precise value of RÃÇ(Pn ) is BollobaÃÅs‚Äô
[10] comment, ‚Äúit would not be surprising if RÃÇ(Pn ) turned out to be about 8n.‚Äù It is not
known what insight led to this comment, but together with the recent flurry of activity on
the upper bound, it inspired us to make a determined effort to improve the lower bound.
We prove the following.
Theorem 1.1. For all  > 0, there exists n0 such that if n ‚â• n0 and G is a graph
with at most (3.75 ‚àí )n edges, there exists a 2-coloring of the edges of G such that every
monochromatic path has order less than n. Thus RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â• (3.75 ‚àí o(1))n.
For the general, r-color version of the problem, the best upper bound is due to Krivelevich [20] who proved RÃÇr (Pn ) = O(r2 log(r)n) (Dudek and Pralat [15] later gave a different

proof). In fact, both [20] and [15] prove the stronger ‚Äúdensity version‚Äù of the theorem:
there exists a graph G (a binomial random graph) with |E(G)| = O(r2 log(r)n) such that
every subgraph of G with at least e(G)/r many edges contains a monochromatic path of
order n (A recent paper of Balogh, Dudek, and Li [3] shows that the factor r2 log r cannot
be improved for this stronger density version in the setting of random graphs).
As for the lower bound, Dudek and Pralat [14] proved that for any r ‚â• 2, RÃÇr (Pn ) ‚â•
(r+3)r

4 n ‚àí O(r ) and then Krivelevich [20] proved that for any r ‚â• 3 such that r ‚àí 2 is a
prime power, RÃÇr (Pn ) ‚â• (r ‚àí 2)2 n ‚àí o(n). We improve on each of these results by proving
the following.
Theorem 1.2. Let r ‚â• 2 and let q be the largest prime power such that q ‚â§ r ‚àí 1. Then

Note that the prime number theorem guarantees that for any Œµ > 0 and r sufficiently
large, there is a prime between (1 ‚àí Œµ)r and r, so for sufficiently large r, the second term
in the maximum will dominate and we have RÃÇr (Pn ) ‚â• (r ‚àí 1 ‚àí or (1))2 n. Determining
whether RÃÇr (Pn ) = Œò(r2 n) or not is perhaps the most interesting open problem regarding
the size-Ramsey number of a path.

1.1

Outline, Notation

Our improvement in the lower bound stems from two main ideas.
1) If we can partition the graph G into sets of order at most n ‚àí 1 such that the
number of edges crossing the partition is at most n ‚àí 2, then we can color the edges inside
the sets red and the edges between the sets blue so there are no monochromatic Pn ‚Äôs.
This has some similarity to the problem of determining the bisection width of a graph ‚Äì
in which case a result of Alon [1, Proposition 3.1] gives good bounds on the number of
crossing edges in a balanced bipartition of graphs with bounded maximum degree and at
most 2n ‚àí 2 vertices. However, in our case, G may not have bounded maximum degree,
G may have more than 2n ‚àí 2 vertices, and we don‚Äôt necessarily want the partition to be
balanced. Nevertheless, with some extra work, we are able to use similar methods from
the bisection width problem (e.g. [1], [21]) in our setting.
2) From the ordinary path Ramsey problem it is known that if G has at most 3n
2 ‚àí2
vertices, then there exists a 2-coloring of G such that every monochromatic path has
order less than n. We show that if G has between roughly 3n/2 and 5n/3 vertices and few
enough edges, then there exists a 2-coloring of G such that every monochromatic path has
order less than n. This allows us to only consider graphs with at least 5n/3 vertices.
In Section 2 we prove a number of lemmas which we will use throughout the proof.
We also show how some of these lemmas imply the previously known lower bounds on the
size-Ramsey number of paths. In Section 3 we prove Theorem 1.1. In Section 4 we prove
Theorem 1.2. In Section 5, we list a few observations and approaches that may helpful in
trying to improve the lower bounds we have provided.
If S is a subset of vertices of a graph G = (V, E), then G ‚àí S refers to G[V \ S].
When G is a graph, we write |G| for |V (G)|. For any other notation we defer to [12]. All

2

logarithms are natural (base e) unless otherwise stated. Throughout the paper, if we refer
to an r-coloring of G, we mean an r-coloring of the edges of G.

Lemmas

When proving a lower bound on the r-color size-Ramsey number of Pn , we are given a
graph G = (V, E) and we must exhibit an r-coloring of the edges of G so that G has
no monochromatic paths of order n. It is often useful to break this into cases depending
the number of vertices of G. In Section 2.1 we use the examples from the ordinary path
Ramsey problem to determine a lower bound on |V |. In Section 2.2 we prove a general
result which allows us, when proving a lower bound on RÃÇr (Pn ), to restrict our attention
to graphs with minimum degree at least r + 1, which in turn gives us an upper bound
on |V |. In Section 2.3, we prove a lemma which we use in the proof of Theorem 1.2. In
Section 2.4, we prove the main lemma of the paper needed for the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Finally, in Section 2.5 we show how to deal with the case when G has between roughly
3n/2 and 5n/3 vertices.

2.1

Examples from the ordinary path Ramsey problem

Proposition 2.1 (GerencseÃÅr, GyaÃÅrfaÃÅs [18]). If G has at most 3n
2 ‚àí 2 vertices, then there
exists a 2-coloring of G such that every monochromatic path has order less than n.
Proof. Partition V (G) into two sets X1 , X2 with |X1 | ‚â§ n2 ‚àí 1 and |X2 | ‚â§ n ‚àí 1. Color all
edges incident with X1 red and all edges inside X2 blue. Any pair of consecutive vertices
on a red path must contain at least one vertex of X1 . Thus the longest red path is of
order at most 2|X1 | + 1 ‚â§ n ‚àí 1.
Proposition 2.2 (Yongqi, Yuansheng, Feng, Bingxi [25]). Let r ‚â• 3. If G has at most
2(r ‚àí 1)( n2 ‚àí 1) = (r ‚àí 1)(n ‚àí 2) vertices, then there exists an r-coloring of G such that
every monochromatic path has order less than n.
Proof. Partition V (G) into 2r ‚àí 2 sets X1 , X2 , . . . , X2r‚àí2 each of order at most n2 ‚àí 1. In
the following, addition is modulo 2r ‚àí 2. For i = 1, . . . , r ‚àí 1, color with color i, the edges
between Xi and Xi+1 , . . . , Xi+r‚àí2 and the edges between Xi+r‚àí1 and Xi+r , . . . Xi+2r‚àí3 .
Use color r for the edges between Xi and Xi+r‚àí1 for i = 1, . . . r ‚àí 1. Color arbitrarily
within the Xi ‚Äôs. This coloring has no monochromatic Pn in color i for i = 1, . . . r ‚àí 1 for
the same reason as in Proposition 2.1. There is none in color r since each component of
color r is of order less than n.

2.2

A reduction lemma

Fact 2.3. If G = (V, E) is a graph with minimum degree at least r + 1, then |V | ‚â§

2|E|
r+1 .

The following lemma shows that in order to get a lower bound on the r-color sizeRamsey number of Pn , we can restrict our attention to graphs G with minimum degree at
least r + 1, and consequently at most 2|E|
r+1 vertices. This generalizes an observation which
is implicit in the proof of Beck‚Äôs lower bound [7].

Lemma 2.4. Let r and n be positive integers with n ‚â• r +4. If every connected graph with
at most m edges and minimum degree at least r + 1 (and consequently at most 2m/(r + 1)
vertices) has an r-coloring such that every monochromatic path has order less than n ‚àí 2,
then every graph with at most m edges has an r-coloring such that every monochromatic
path has order less than n.
A star is a tree having at most one vertex of degree at least 2. A star forest is a
vertex disjoint collection of stars. The star arboricity of a graph G, denoted sa(G), is
the minimum number of star forests needed to partition the edge set of G. In order to
keep this aspect of the proof self contained, we give a short proof of the fact that the star
arboricity of graph is at most ‚àÜ(G). We note that stronger statements are known (see [8,
Theorem 1] for instance), but not needed for our purposes.
Fact 2.5. sa(G) ‚â§ ‚àÜ(G)
Proof. Clearly this is true for ‚àÜ = 1. Suppose ‚àÜ ‚â• 2 and the statement holds for all
graphs G with ‚àÜ(G) ‚â§ ‚àÜ ‚àí 1. Let G be a graph with ‚àÜ(G) = ‚àÜ.
Claim 2.6. Every graph G without isolated vertices contains a star-forest S such that
every vertex is incident with an edge of S.
Proof. Let F be a spanning forest consisting of a spanning tree of each component of G.
Let z be a leaf of F and let y be the neighbor of z in F . Let C be the star consisting of
y and all of the neighbors of y which are leaves in F . Note that in F ‚àí C, there are no
isolated vertices and thus we may repeat this process until F ‚àí C is empty at which point
we have the desired star forest.
Apply Claim 2.6 to G to get a star forest S such that every non-isolated vertex in
G is incident with an edge of S. After deleting the edges of S we have a graph G0 with
maximum degree at most ‚àÜ ‚àí 1 and we may apply induction to finish the proof.
Proof of Lemma 2.4. Suppose that every connected graph with at most m edges and minimum degree at least r+1 has an r-coloring such that every monochromatic path has order
less than n ‚àí 2. Let G be a graph with at most m edges. Let S = {v ‚àà V (G) : d(v) ‚â§ r}.
We begin by describing how to color the edges of G ‚àí S so that G ‚àí S contains no
monochromatic paths of order n ‚àí 2.
If G ‚àí S has fewer than n ‚àí 2 vertices, then coloring the edges of G ‚àí S arbitrarily
we have an r-coloring of G ‚àí S with no monochromatic paths of order n ‚àí 2. So suppose
G ‚àí S has at least n ‚àí 2 ‚â• r + 2 vertices. Let v be a vertex in G ‚àí S and suppose that
v has exactly r + 1 ‚àí t neighbors in G ‚àí S for some positive t. This means v had at
least t neighbors in S, so by making v adjacent to t vertices in G ‚àí S (each of which
was previously a non-neighbor of v) we make v have degree at least r + 1 and the total
number of edges is still at most m. We repeat this process for each vertex in G ‚àí S which
has degree less than r + 1, updating on each step. We end up with a graph H such that
G ‚àí S ‚äÜ H, H has at most m edges, and Œ¥(G) ‚â• r + 1. For each connected component of
H, color the edges according to the hypothesis so that there are no monochromatic paths
of order n ‚àí 2. This implies that G ‚àí S has no monochromatic paths of order n ‚àí 2. Note
that we are now done with graph H.

Since ‚àÜ(G[S]) ‚â§ r, by Fact 2.5 we can color the edges of G[S] with r colors so that
every color class is a star forest. The only edges we have yet to color are the edges between
S and G ‚àí S. Let v be a vertex in S and suppose that v sends t edges to G ‚àí S. This
means that v has at most r ‚àí t neighbors in S and is incident with edges of at most r ‚àí t
different colors in S, which means there are at least t colors which are not used on v. Use
these t colors to color each of the edges from v to G ‚àí S so that each such edge receives a
different color. After doing this for each vertex in S, we have colored all of the edges of G.
Note that any monochromatic path which only uses edges from G ‚àí S has order less than
n ‚àí 2, any monochromatic path which only uses edges from G[S] and [S, V (G) ‚àí S] has
order at most 3. If a monochromatic, say color 1, path uses an edge from [S, V (G) ‚àí S],
then since its endpoint in S is not incident with any other edges of color 1, this edge
must be a pendant edge of the path (of which there are only two) and thus the longest
monochromatic path in G has order less than (n ‚àí 2) + 2 = n.
Remark 2.7. Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.4 imply that RÃÇ(Pn ) > 94 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí 3.

Pruning a tree so that no long paths remain

The following is a slight generalization of the lemma used in [10] and [14] to give a lower
bound on the size-Ramsey number of a path.
Lemma 2.9. For every tree T with |V (T )| ‚â• bn/2c, there exists a set E 0 of at most
|V |
b bn/2c
c ‚àí 1 edges such that T ‚àí E 0 has no paths of order n.
Proof. If T has no path of order n we are done, so choose a path of order n and delete
the middle edge (or one of the two middle edges if n is odd). This separates T into two
subtrees, each with at least bn/2c vertices. Now repeat on each subtree and call the set of
deleted edges, E 0 . When the process stops, every component of T ‚àí E 0 has at least bn/2c
|V |
c components, which
vertices and no paths of order n. Thus T ‚àí E 0 has at most b bn/2c

means |E 0 | ‚â§ b bn/2c

Remark 2.10. Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.9 imply that RÃÇ(Pn ) > 52 n ‚àí 7.
Proof. Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph with at most 5n
2 ‚àí 7 edges. We may assume
G is connected and by Proposition 2.1, we have 3n

2 ‚àí 5 edges and no paths of order n, so we may
color all of the edges of F red. There are at most n ‚àí 2 edges remaining in E(G) \ E(F ),
all of which we may color blue.

Main lemma

We will only use the following lemma in the case where k = 1 or k = 2, but we state
it in general here. Note that for instance when k = 1, this says that if G is a graph on
n ‚àí 3 < N ‚â§ 2(n ‚àí 3) vertices, then there is a bipartition of V (G) into sets of order n ‚àí 3
and N ‚àí (n ‚àí 3) such that the number of edges crossing the partition is approximately
what we would get by taking a random such partition of a graph with |E(G)| ‚àí N edges.
Lemma 2.11. Let n ‚â• 4, let G = (V, E) be a graph on N ‚â• n ‚àí 2 vertices, and let k
be a positive integer uniquely defined by k(n ‚àí 3) < N ‚â§ (k + 1)(n ‚àí 3) where k ‚â§ n1/64 .

Let Œ±1 = n‚àí3
. If every component of G has at least n ‚àí 2 vertices,
N and Œ±2 =
N
1/16
‚àÜ(G) ‚â§ N
and |E| ‚â§ 100N ‚â§ 100(k + 1)n, then there exists a partition of V into k + 1
parts V1 , . . . , Vk+1 such that |V1 |, . . . , |Vk |, |Vk+1 | ‚â§ n‚àí3 and |Vk+1 | ‚â§ N ‚àík(n‚àí3)+N 15/16
and the number of edges crossing the partition is at most (1 ‚àí kŒ±12 ‚àí Œ±22 )(|E| ‚àí N ) + N 15/16 .
The first tool needed to prove Lemma 2.11 is the following fact mentioned by Alon [1],
stated in general and made explicit here.
Lemma 2.12. Let G be a connected graph on p vertices with maximum degree ‚àÜ. For
any 1 ‚â§ ` < p, we can find a collection of connected subgraphs S1 , . . . , St of G such that
(T1) V (S1 ), . . . , V (St ) form a partition of V (G) with ` < |Si | ‚â§ 1 + ‚àÜ` for all i ‚àà [t ‚àí 1]

Proof. Let T0 be a rooted spanning tree of G with (arbitrary) root r. For a rooted tree T
and vertex v, let s(T, v) denote the subtree of T rooted at vertex v and let C(v) denote
the set of children of v. Assume Ti has been defined for some i ‚â• 0 and that r is still the
root of Ti . Traverse down Ti from r until encountering a vertex v (if one exists) such that
|s(Ti , v)| > ` and |s(Ti , u)| ‚â§ ` for all u ‚àà C(v). Then s(Ti , v) satisfies

` < |s(Ti , v)| = 1 +
|s(Ti , u)| ‚â§ 1 + ‚àÜ`.

If v 6= r, let Si+1 = s(Ti , v) and Ti+1 = Ti ‚àí Si+1 and repeat for i + 1. If v = r or if
no such vertex v exists, then set Si+1 = St = Ti . Each Si is connected by construction.
Property
Pt (T1) is satisfied
Ptby (1). Property (T2) follows since each Si is connected and
thus i=1 |E(G[Si ])| ‚â• i=1 (|Si | ‚àí 1) = p ‚àí t.

and from each of (t ‚àí 1)(b pc + 1) ‚â§ p and p ‚â§ t(1 + ‚àÜ p) ‚â§ t p(1 + ‚àÜ), we derive the
bounds on t in (T3).
The next tool we need is the following concentration inequality of McDiarmid [23] (see
also [17]).

There are at least‚àöN ‚àí (t ‚àí 1) ‚â• N ‚àí N edges accounted for in these subgraphs. Define
m = |E| ‚àí (N ‚àí N ) to be an upper bound on the number of edges of G which are not
contained in these subgraphs.
We independently at random place each such connected subgraph in one of the sets
V1 , . . . , Vk , Vk+1 with probabilities Œ±1 , . . . , Œ±1 , Œ±2 respectively. Let Zi represent the number
of vertices which land in the set Vi for all i ‚àà [k + 1].
Then E [Z1 ] = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = E [Zk ] = Œ±1 N and E [Zk+1 ] = Œ±2 N . Note that changing
‚àö the
position of one of S1 , . . . , St can change any of these variables by at most 1 + ‚àÜ N ‚â§
N 9/16 . Thus we may apply McDiarmid‚Äôs inequality (Lemma 2.13) and the union bound
to conclude that the probability that for some i ‚àà [k], Zi exceeds Œ±1 N + N 7/8 or Zk+1

following: if |Vi | > n ‚àí 3 for i ‚àà [k] or |Vk+1 | > N ‚àí k(n ‚àí 3), there must exist j ‚àà [k] such
that |Vj | < n ‚àí 3 or Vk+1 < N ‚àí k(n ‚àí 3), so we select a vertex from Vi ‚à© S and we move it
to Vj . Because of the size of |S|, we can repeat this process until we have |V1 | = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = |Vk |
and |Vk+1 | = N ‚àí k(n ‚àí 3). The total number of vertices moved will be at most kN 7/8 .
In either case, at the end of this process, the number of edges crossing the partition is at

Extending Proposition 2.1

The following observations extend Proposition 2.1. We note that there is a similarity
between this observation and the concept of the integrity of a graph (see [24]).
Observation 2.14. If G has a set S of at most n2 ‚àí 1 vertices such that every component
of G ‚àí S has no path of order n, then there exists a 2-coloring of the edges of G such that
every monochromatic path has order less than n.

Figure 1: Coloring the edges of G in Observation 2.14

Proof. We color all edges incident to S with red and every other edge blue. Clearly there
will be no blue path of order n. Any pair of consecutive vertices on a red path must
contain at least one vertex of S. Thus the longest red path is of order less than n.
We also note that there is a similarity between the following observation and the
concept of the edge integrity of a graph (see [2]).
Observation 2.15. If G has a subgraph H such that H has no path of order n (in
particular, if H has at most n ‚àí 2 edges) and every component of (V (G), E(G) \ E(H))
has order less than n, then there exists a 2-coloring of the edges of G such that every
monochromatic path has order less than n.
Proof. Color the edges of H with red and color the remaining edges blue.

The following lemma says that if the number of vertices is not too much more than
3n/2 and the number of edges of G is small enough, we can essentially color G in a way
which resembles the coloring in Proposition 2.1.
Lemma 2.16. Let 0 <  < 61 , let n be sufficiently large, and let G = (V, E) be a graph
with Œ¥(G) ‚â• 3 on 32 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí 2 + œÉn vertices where 0 < œÉ ‚â§ 61 ‚àí . Let d be an integer
n
such that 4 ‚â§ d ‚â§ min{ 1/2‚àí3

then there exists a partition {X, Y, Z} of U such that
(i) every vertex in X has at most one neighbor in Z and
(ii) |Z| ‚â§ n ‚àí 3, |Y | ‚â§ n‚àí6
2 ‚àí q, and |X| + |Y | ‚â§ n ‚àí 3.
Consequently, there exists a 2-coloring of G such that every blue path has order at most
n ‚àí 3 and every red path has order at most n ‚àí 3.
Proof. First note that there is a value of d which satisfies 4 ‚â§ d ‚â§ 1/2‚àí3

Let Y1 = {v ‚àà Y ‚àó : dH (v, X) = 1} and Y2 = {v ‚àà Y ‚àó : dH (v, X) ‚â• 2}. We note that

most n ‚àí 5 ‚àí 2q and since the red edges from X to Z form a matching, the longest red
path overall in H has order at most n ‚àí 3 ‚àí 2q.
Finally, coloring all edges from V0 = V \U to X ‚à™Y ‚à™V0 blue and all edges from V0 to Z
red (see Figure 2c), we have that the longest red path is at most n ‚àí 3 ‚àí 2q + 2|V0 | = n ‚àí 3,
and the longest blue path has order at most n ‚àí 3 since |X| + |Y | + |V0 |, |Z| ‚â§ n ‚àí 3.

Two colors

We are now ready to give a proof of Theorem 1.1. We note that if G had bounded
maximum degree, we would be able to directly apply Lemma 2.11 (or Lemma 2.16). So
dealing with the ‚Äúhigh degree‚Äù vertices is the main challenge which remains. We also note
that the  in the following proof can be taken to be as small as  = n‚àíŒò(1) ; however, for
the sake of readability, we didn‚Äôt try to optimize the value of .
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let  > 0 and let n0 be a sufficiently large integer (the value of
which we don‚Äôt explicitly compute, but we will point out which inequalities depend on n
being sufficiently large). Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph on N vertices with at most
(3 + Œ≥ ‚àí )n edges, where 0 ‚â§ Œ≥ < 3/2 is to be chosen later (ultimately, we will choose
Œ≥ = 3/4, but we leave it undetermined for now because it helps to see where there is slack
in certain parts of the proof). By Lemma 2.4 it suffices to assume that Œ¥(G) ‚â• 3 and thus
N ‚â§ 2|E|/3 ‚â§ (2 + 2Œ≥/3 ‚àí 2/3)n < 3(n ‚àí 2). Since we are using Lemma 2.4, our goal for
the rest of the proof is to exhibit a 2-coloring of G which has no monochromatic paths of
order n ‚àí 2. So by Proposition 2.1 we may assume that N ‚â• 23 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí 1.
Let V0 = {v ‚àà V (G) : d(v) > n1/32 }. We have n1/32 |V0 | ‚â§ 2|E| and thus since n is
sufficiently large,
n
|V0 | ‚â§ 2(3 + Œ≥ ‚àí )n31/32 ‚â§

We say that a component C of G ‚àí V0 is small if |C| < n ‚àí 2, medium if n ‚àí 2 ‚â§ |C| ‚â§
3
3
2 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí |V0 | ‚àí 2, and large if 2 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí |V0 | ‚àí 1 ‚â§ |C|.
Regarding the components of G‚àíV0 , if there is at most one medium component B, and
the rest of the components are small, select a set S ‚äÜ B such that |V0 | + |S| = b n‚àí2
2 c ‚àí 1.
Note that every component of G ‚àí (S ‚à™ V0 ) has order at most

and thus we are done by Observation 2.14.
Since N < 3(n‚àí2), if there is more than one medium component, then there are exactly
2, call them B1 and B2 and the remaining components C1 , . . . , Ct are small. Likewise, if
there is one large component A, then there is exactly one and either we have a medium
component B and the remaining components C1 , . . . , Ct are small, or there are no medium
components and the remaining components C1 , . . . , Ct are small. Let U = A, U = A ‚à™ B,
or U = B1 ‚à™ B2 depending on the case and note that in any case |U | ‚â• 32 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí 1 ‚àí |V0 |.
Case 1 First suppose that 32 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí 1 ‚àí |V0 | ‚â§ |U | ‚â§ 2(n ‚àí 3). We parameterize this by
introducing a variable œÉ such that |U | = 23 (n ‚àí 2) ‚àí 2 ‚àí |V0 | + œÉn where 0 < œÉ < 12 + |Vn0 | .

11

Case 1.1 Suppose 0 < œÉ ‚â§ 61 ‚àí  (in this case U must consist of one large component).
We apply Lemma 2.16 to G[U ‚à™ V0 ] with  and œÉ as given, d = min{b 1/2‚àí3

n (because of this, it
4
would suffice to choose d = 4 if œÉ ‚â• 1/8 and d = 5 otherwise).
The lemma provides a partition of U as {X, Y, Z}. We color the edges exactly as in
Lemma 2.16 and additionally we color all edges from V0 to the small components red and
all edges inside the small components blue. Since |Y | + |V0 | ‚â§ n‚àí6
2 the longest red path
still has order at most n ‚àí 3 (that is, the extra red edges from V0 to the small components
do not change the properties of the coloring from Lemma 2.16).

We note two things about the previous proof. We originally dealt with the case |U | =
‚àí 2) ‚àí 1 + œÉn as a whole rather than splitting into the subcases 0 < œÉ . 1/6 and
‚àö
1/6 . œÉ . 1/2. Without the subcases, the bound ‚àö
we obtained in (6) was Œ≥ ‚â§ 3 ‚àí 1
which gives an overall lower bound of RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â• (2 + 3 ‚àí o(1))n ‚âà 3.732n. So by dealing
with the subcases separately, we got an improvement of about (0.018 ‚àí o(1))n.
If one were to attempt to improve the lower bound of (3.75 ‚àí o(1))n, a good test case
3
would be when |U | ‚âà 5n

and œÉ ‚âà 1/6 which is the bottleneck of the above proof (see Figure 5).

More than two colors

The following theorem implies the first part of Theorem 1.2. We simply use the r = 2
case and induction.
Proposition 4.1. For all r ‚â• 2 and sufficiently large n, if G is a graph with at most
( (r‚àí1)r
+ 2.75 ‚àí o(1))n edges, then there exists a r-coloring of the edges of G such that
2
every monochromatic path has order less than n.

13

Figure 5: The value of c on the x-axis represents |U | = cn. For a given value of c, the
curve shows the maximum number of edges G can have so that our proof gives a 2-coloring
of G with no monochromatic Pn . The blue curve corresponds to Case 1.1, the red curve to
Case 1.2, and the green curve to Case 2. Note that the minimum over the entire interval
is 3.75 and occurs when c = 5/3.

Proof. Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph. For r = 2, this holds by Theorem 1.1. So
let r ‚â• 3 and suppose the result holds for all smaller r. If N ‚â§ (r ‚àí 1)(n ‚àí 2), then we are
done by Proposition 2.2; so suppose N ‚â• (r ‚àí 1)(n ‚àí 2) + 1. Let T be a spanning tree of
G and apply Lemma 2.9 to get a forest F with no paths of order n and at least N ‚àí 2r2
edges. Color the edges of the forest with color r. The number of remaining edges is at
most ( (r‚àí1)r
+ 2.75 ‚àí o(1))n ‚àí (r ‚àí 1)n ‚àí 2r2 = ( (r‚àí2)(r‚àí1)
+ 2.75 ‚àí o(1))n and thus we
2
2
may apply induction to color the remaining edges with the remaining r ‚àí 1 colors.
Remark 4.2. The bound is Proposition 4.1 is larger than the bound in Remark 2.8 for
2 ‚â§ r ‚â§ 6, and for r ‚â• 7, the bound in Remark 2.8 is larger.
Definition 4.3. An affine plane of order q is a q-uniform hypergraph on q 2 vertices (called
points), with q(q + 1) edges (called lines) such that each pair of vertices is contained in
exactly one edge.
It is well known that an affine plane of order q exists whenever q is a prime power (and
14

it is unknown whether there exists an affine plane of non-prime power order). We collect
two key properties of affine planes in the following proposition.
Proposition 4.4. Let q ‚â• 2 such that there exists an affine plane of order q. There exists
a q + 1-coloring of the edges of Kq2 such that
(i) every color class (called a parallel class) consists of a collection of q vertex disjoint
Kq ‚Äôs, and
(ii) every vertex is contained in exactly one edge of each color and the union of these
q + 1 edges is all of V (Kq2 ).
The following theorem implies the second part of Theorem 1.2. We modify Krivelevich‚Äôs proof [20, Theorem 8] in such a way that no color is ‚Äúwasted‚Äù on the high degree
vertices. This improves the lower bound from ((r ‚àí 2)2 ‚àí o(1))n to ((r ‚àí 1)2 ‚àí o(1))n.
Proposition 4.5. Let r ‚â• 3 and let q ‚â§ r ‚àí 1 be the largest integer such that an affine
plane of order q exists (effectively, let q ‚â§ r ‚àí 1 be the largest integer such that q is a prime
power) and suppose n is sufficiently large. For all graphs G with at most q 2 n ‚àí 6q 4 n0.9 =
(q 2 ‚àí o(1))n edges, there exists a q + 1-coloring (which is an r-coloring) of the edges of G
such that every monochromatic path has order less than n.

Proof. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with |E| ‚â§ q 2 ‚àí6q 4 n.9 . Let V0 := v ‚àà V (G) d(v) ‚â• n0.1 .
Then q 2 n ‚â• |E(G)| ‚â• 21 |V0 |n0.1 implies that |V0 | ‚â§ 2q 2 n0.9 . Now randomly partition V \V0
into q 2 parts V1 , . . . Vq2 by placing each vertex into one of these sets independently with
probability 1/q 2 . Let L be a line of the affine plane Aq on point set [q 2 ]. For each edge
e in G[V \ V0 ], we assign color i to e if the endpoints of e are in sets Vx and Vy where
the unique line containing x and y in Aq is in the i‚Äôth parallel class of Aq . We color e
arbitrarily if both of its endpoints are in Vx for some x.

For a line L of Aq , define the random variable XL := |E
x‚ààL Vx |. Then

Since every vertex of V \ V0 has degree at most n0.1 , we have that moving any one vertex
from Vx to Vy can change XL by at most n0.1 . Thus we may apply McDiarmid‚Äôs inequality

Where we used |V \ V0 | ‚â§ |E| ‚â§ q 2 n in the last inequality. Thus taking a union bound

S that there exists a partition of V \ V0 in which at
2

most n ‚àí 5q n edges lie inside x‚ààL Vx for all lines L. Suppose V1 , . . . , Vq2 is such a
partition.
Let L1 , . . . , Lq+1 be the lines from Aq incident with the point 1, one from each parallel
2
class (which is possible
S by Proposition 4.4(ii)). Note that for all j ‚àà [q ]\{1}, Vj intersects
precisely
S one such x‚ààLi Vx for i ‚àà [q + 1]. For each i ‚àà [q + 1], we color the edges from
V0 to x‚ààLi Vx with color i (coloring the edges from V0 to V1 arbitrarily). Now every edge
from V0 to V \ V0 has been colored and for each color i ‚àà [q + 1], there exists a unique line

The sets x‚ààL Vx where L does not contain point 1 still contain less than n ‚àí 1 edges and
thus have no path of order n.

and Remark 2.8 for all r ‚â• 4.

Additional observations and conclusion

In this section we collect a few additional thoughts, none of which fit into into the main
thread of the paper. The four observations below quantify the intuitive notion that if
G is a graph having the property that every 2-coloring of the edges of G contains a
monochromatic Pn , then G must be ‚Äúexpansive‚Äù in some sense.
For a graph G = (V, E), let SV be the set of permutations of V . The bandwidth, œï of
G is defined as
œï(G) := min max |f (u) ‚àí f (v)|.
f ‚ààSV uv‚ààE

Observation 5.1. If œï(G) ‚â§ n2 ‚àí 1, then there is a 2-coloring of the edges of G such that
every monochromatic path has order less than n.
Proof. Order the vertex set to witness the minimum bandwidth, then split the vertices
into sets V1 , . . . , Vt , with |V1 | = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = |Vt‚àí1 | = b n2 ‚àí 1c and |Vt | ‚â§ n ‚àí 1. For all odd i ‚àà [t],
color the edges from Vi to Vi ‚à™ Vi+1 red, and for all even j ‚àà [t] color the edges from Vj to
Vi ‚à™ Vj+1 blue.
A depth first search (DFS) tree (or normal tree) T rooted at x in a graph G is a subtree
of G such that for all uv ‚àà E(G) with u, v ‚àà V (T ), either v is on the x ‚àí v path in T or u
is on the x ‚àí u path in T .
For a connected subgraph H of a graph G and vertices u, v ‚àà V (H), let dH (u, v) be
the length of the shortest path between u and v in H. A breadth first search (BFS) tree T
rooted at x is a subtree of G such that for all v ‚àà V (T ), dT (x, v) = dG (x, v). Such a tree
has the property that for all uv ‚àà E(G) with u, v ‚àà V (T ), |dT (x, u) ‚àí dT (x, v)| ‚â§ 1. The
vertices at each fixed distance from the root are called the levels of T . It is well known
that for every connected graph G and every vertex x ‚àà V (G), there exists a spanning DFS
tree T rooted at x and a spanning BFS tree rooted at x.
Using the notation for rooted trees from the proof of Lemma 2.12, we have the following
observation.
Observation 5.2. Let G be a connected graph. If there exists a vertex x and a DFS tree
T rooted at x so that every child y ‚àà C(x) satisfies |S(T, y)| ‚â§ 5n
4 ‚àí 2, then there exists a
2-coloring of the edges of G such that every monochromatic path has order less than n.

Proof. For each sub-tree S(T, y) where y ‚àà C(x), we partition the vertices of S(T,
S y) into
n
sets Ay and
B
where
|A

‚â§

y
‚àà

and
|B

‚â§

Let
A
=
{x}
‚à™

y‚ààC(x) Ay

S y
and B = y‚ààC(x) By . We color the edges of G within B blue and the edges from A to
A ‚à™ B red. Note that this is all the edges of G since no edges go between S(T, y) and
S(T, z) for y, z ‚àà C(x), y 6= z. Clearly there are no blue paths of order n. Any red path
may intersect at most two of the sub-trees S(T, y), S(T, z) for y, z ‚àà C(x), y 6= z and
any such path must pass through x. For all y ‚àà C(x), the longest possible red path in
G[Ay ‚à™ By ] is of order at most n2 ‚àí 1 and so the longest red path in G is of order at most
n ‚àí 1.
Observation 5.3. Let G be a connected graph. If there exists a vertex x and a BFS tree
T rooted at x such that every pair of consecutive levels of T have fewer than n vertices,
then there exists a 2-coloring of the edges of G such that every monochromatic path has
order less than n.
Proof. For all i ‚â• 0, let Di = {v : dT (x, v) = i}. For all j ‚â• 0, color the edges from D2j
to D2j ‚à™ D2j+1 red and the edges from D2j+1 to D2j+1 ‚à™ D2j+2 blue. By the property of
BFS trees, this accounts for every edge in G. Since every two consecutive levels contain
fewer than n vertices, there are no monochromatic paths of order n.
The following observation was inspired by Figure 2 in both [4] and [5].
Observation 5.4. If G is a graph on N vertices with Œ±(G) ‚â• N ‚àí (n ‚àí 2), then there
exists a 2-coloring of the edges of G such that every monochromatic path has order less
than n.
Proof. Let S be an independent set of order at least N ‚àí (n ‚àí 2) and partition the vertices
of V (G) \ S into disjoint sets X, Y with |X|, |Y | ‚â§ n2 ‚àí 1. Color all edges incident with
X red and color all edges incident with Y blue (so edges between X and Y can be either
color). The longest monochromatic path has order at most 2( n2 ‚àí 1) + 1 = n ‚àí 1.
Finally, we end with the following question which relates to the upper bound on the
size-Ramsey number of a path.
Question 5.5. What is the largest monochromatic path one can find in an arbitrary 2coloring of a d-regular graph on n vertices?
For instance, suppose d = 5 and there was an upper bound of n/28. This would
imply that 5-regular graphs on 28n vertices (having 70n edges) have a 2-coloring with no
monochromatic Pn . In other words, 5-regular graphs could never improve the current best
[14] upper bound RÃÇ(Pn ) ‚â§ 74n.
