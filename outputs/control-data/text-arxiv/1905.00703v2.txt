Abstract
The fermion self-energy is calculated from the rainbow-ladder truncation of the Dyson–Schwinger equation (DSE) in quantum electrodynamics
(QED) for spacelike momenta and in the complex momentum plane close
to the timelike region, both using Pauli–Villars regularization. Specifically, the DSE is solved in the complex momentum plane by rotating
either the energy component of the four-momentum or the magnitude
of Euclidean four-momentum to reach the timelike region in Minkowski
space. The coupling constant is appropriately chosen to ensure the singularities of the fermion propagator are located in the timelike region while
producing significant differences from the perturbative solutions. For simplicity, we choose Feynman gauge, but the method is applicable in other
covariant gauges as well. We demonstrate that the approximate spectral
representation based on the fermion self-energy near the timelike region
is consistent with the solution of the DSE directly in the Euclidean space.

Motivation

The measurable quantities associated with the structure of a hadron state in
the full possible kinematical range, which would be obtained by solving, e.g.
quantum chromodynamics (QCD), require the knowledge of matrix elements of
physical operators with timelike momenta. This poses a challenge to methods
based on a purely Euclidean formulation of QCD, using either discretization
methods such as lattice gauge theories, or continuum methods like the Dyson–
Schwinger (DSE) and Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSE) [1]. To extract physical
observables defined in Minkowski space, these methods have to rely on an analytic continuation from Euclidean space such that e.g. the momenta of physical
hadrons are on-shell (in the timelike region). This is straightforward to do for

mesons as bound states of a quark and anti-quark [2, 3], and can also been done
for baryons. Furthermore, Poincaré-invariant form factors can be obtained [4, 5]
in a limited momentum region without any ambiguity. However, starting from
a purely Euclidean formulation, it is far from trivial to access observables defined on the light-front, such as the the parton distribution functions and their
generalizations.
Here we remind the readers that with these continuum methods, it is essential to take into account the nonperturbative dressing of quark propagators and
vertices, in particular for light mesons: the pions represent the Goldstone bosons
associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, and their Bethe–Salpeter
amplitudes are closely related to the self-energies of the light quarks [6]. Thus,
if one aims to explore the rich kinematical range associated with observable
hadron structure, it is desirable to obtain the solution of the BSE with dressed
quark propagators in Minkowski space.
To make progress with the DSEs applied to QCD, it is therefore necessary to obtain the dressed propagators in Minkowski space. The DSE for the
fermion self-energy within a QED-like model and rainbow-ladder truncation has
been studied extensively. Early investigations based on analytic continuation of
the Euclidean DSE suggested the existence of a pair of mass-like singularities
at complex-conjugate momenta [7, 8, 9]. Subsequently, the DSE was studied
in Minkowski metric using the Nakanishi integral representation (NIR) [10] in
Refs. [11, 12, 13]. Their results showed a complicated analytic structure of the
self-energies in the timelike region, which deserves to be studied further. More
recently, the solutions for DSE for the fermion propagator in Minkowski space
with on-shell renormalization within quenched QED were obtained in Ref. [14].
Efforts in solving the two-boson BSE in Minkowski space with bare particles
using the NIR have been undertaken since the pioneering works in Refs. [15, 16],
which relied on the uniqueness of the Nakanishi weight function in the nonperturbative domain of bound states. These techniques were further developed by
the introduction of the light-front projection allied to the NIR to solve the BSE’s
for bosons [17, 18, 19, 20] and for fermions [21, 22, 23]. Recently we obtained the
approximate two-boson Minkowski Bethe–Salpeter amplitude from the solution
of the Euclidean BSE by numerically ‘un-Wick rotating’ the homogeneous integral equation towards Minkowski space [24]. The solutions found with this new
approach reveal the rich analytic structure of the Bethe–Salpeter amplitude,
consistent with the one obtained in Minkowski space via the Nakanishi integral
representation.
Motivated by the success of the un-Wick rotation method developed for solving the BSE, and the challenge to obtain the self-energy in the timelike region,
this approach is extended here to investigate the fermion self-energies both in
the spacelike and the timelike regions. We use the rainbow-ladder truncation of
the fermion DSE with a massive or massless exchange vector boson. In Sec. 2,
the truncated DSE is presented with its representations both in Minkowski metric and in Euclidean metric. Here we restrict ourselves to Feynman gauge, but
the method is applicable in any covariant gauge. We rely on Pauli–Villars (PV)
regularization to eliminate ultraviolet divergences; for simplicity we do not ap-

ply any renormalization condition, so our numerical results depend on the PV
mass.
We solve the truncated DSE in the complex momentum plane using two
different implementations:
1. the complex-rotation of the fourth component of the Euclidean four-momenta
towards the zeroth component (energy component) of the four-momenta
in Minkowski metric (‘un-Wick rotation’);
2. and an analytic continuation of the magnitude of the Euclidean fourmomenta to rotate the Euclidean DSE on the spacelike axis towards the
pure timelike axis in Minkowski metric,
as described in Sec. 3. Both implementations give (within their numerical uncertainty) the same results in a large region of the complex momentum plane. The
numerical results for the self-energies are discussed in Sect. 4. In this preliminary
study, the coupling constant is chosen below the critical value for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, but large enough to allow for nonperturbative effects.
We also demonstrate that the obtained results close to the timelike axis can be
used as a good approximation to the spectral representation of the self-energy.

DSE in Minkowski and Euclidean metric

In Minkowski metric we can write the inverse fermion propagator S −1 as

S −1 (p) = p/A(p2 ) − B(p2 ) = A(p2 ) p/ − M (p2 ) ,

(1)

with M (p2 ) = B(p2 )/A(p2 ). For convenience we also define Z(p2 ) = 1/A(p2 ).
With this notation, the fermion propagator S can be written as
S(p) =

p/ + M (p2 )
A(p2 ) p/ + B(p2 )
= Z(p2 ) 2
,
2
2

2
A(p ) p − B (p ) + iǫ
p − M 2 (p2 ) + iǫ

(2)

where we have introduced the iǫ prescription to select the correct Riemann sheet
when the denominator in the spectral representation vanishes. For simplicity
however, we will suppress the explicit iǫ’s unless that could cause ambiguities.
Next, consider DSE for the fermion propagator in the rainbow (ladder) truncation by coupling to a vector boson with mass µ and PV regularization with

where ξ is the gauge parameter. The Landau gauge is defined by ξ = 0, while
ξ = 1 defines the Feynman gauge. For simplicity, we will only consider Feynman
gauge here. Projecting out the equations for A and B we arrive at

Solving the DSE numerically directly in Minkowski space poses the following
challenges:
• the integration

• the known singularities in the denominators (q 2 − µ2 ) and (q 2 − Λ2 );
• the unknown but expected singularity in the denominator k 2 A2 (k 2 ) −

The latter two could be overcome by using an explicitly nonzero i ǫ in the propagators denominators. However, numerically this is not necessarily stable, in
particular since the location of the singularity in the fermion propagator is determined by the solution of the DSE.
Indeed, the common practice is to perform a formal Wick rotation to Euclidean space, avoiding the singularities alltogether. Of course, the DSE can
only be solved for Euclidean momenta after such a procedure, corresponding to
spacelike momenta in Minkowski metric. Specifically, after applying the formal
Wick rotation, we obtain the fermion DSE using Euclidean four-vectors pE and

Note that in Euclidean metric, p2E runs from 0 to +∞, and that results for

in Minkowski metric. In the next section we discuss how one can obtain the
solution of the DSE for timelike momenta.

It is straightforward to solve these coupled nonlinear integral equations iteratively using a suitable discretization of the integrals and an initial guess for the
functions A and B.

Un-Wick rotating from the Euclidean solution

We can now solve for A and B as functions of two variables p4 and pv , and
up to numerical precision, we should get the same results for A(p24 + p2v ) and
B(p24 + p2v ) as above.
We can now undo the Wick rotation by applying the transformation

p4 → e−iδ p4 ,

k4 → e−iδ k4 ,

dk4 → e−iδ dk4 ,

(18)

while keeping p4 and k4 real, analogous to the method used in Ref. [24] to obtain
the Minkowski space Bethe–Salpeter amplitudes from the Euclidean BSE. As
long as the contribution from the integral along the arcs at |k4 | = ±∞ vanishes,
true in the case of PV regularization, we only need to keep the integration over
k4 from −∞ to ∞.
In the limit of δ → π/2 this transformation becomes
p4 → −i p4 ≡ p0 ,

k4 → −i k4 ≡ k0 ,

dk4 → −i dk4 ≡ dk0 ,

(19)

which recovers the DSEs in Minkowski metric, for both the spacelike and the
timelike region. Indeed, applying this transformation to Eqs. (16) and (17) we

Figure 1: Real and imaginary parts of the inverse propagator functions A
(solid) and B (dashed), at different angles δ, obtained by un-Wick rotating the
Euclidean solution as function of pv at p4 = 0, corresponding to the spacelike
p2 axis (left) and as function of p4 at pv = 0, along a line in the complex p4 e−i δ
plane (right); δ = π/2 would be the timelike axis. On the right we also show
our results of rotating the magnitude of p from the spacelike region towards the
timelike region, which are indistinguishable at the scale shown. Parameters are
m0 = 0.5, µ = 1.0, Λ = 10.0, and α = 0.5.
expressions for the DSEs in Minkowski metric for both timelike and spacelike
momenta, there are singularities in the propagators under the integral, which
are understood in conjunction with iǫ prescription.
With δ ∈ (0, π/2), the transformation given by Eq. (18) acts as the tool to
interpolate the DSEs between Euclidean and Minkowski metrics. In the limit of
δ → π/2, the Minkowski space invariant p2 = p20 − p2v is real, and runs from −∞
to +∞. But for 0 < δ < π/2 the ‘invariant’ p2 = −e−2iδ p24 − p2v covers a slice in
the upper complex p2 plane. As δ approaches π/2, it covers almost the entire
upper complex momentum plane, and ‘collapses’ onto the real axis only in the
limit δ → π/2. As long as there are no singularities in the upper complex p2
plane, we can continuously connect the solution of the DSEs near the timelike
region to the solution in the spacelike region. As a consistency check, for any
value of 0 ≥ δ ≥ π/2 we should obtain the same (spacelike) solution for p4 = 0.
In Fig. 1 we present solutions of the DSE in the Feynman gauge obtained
by un-Wick rotating p4 . When un-Wick rotating p4 from Euclidean metric, we
solve the DSE on a slice in the complex p2 = ei 2δ p24 + p2v plane; the boundaries
of this slice are given by (p4 = 0, pv ), which corresponds to the spacelike axis,
and by (p4 , pv = 0), which approaches the timelike axis in the limit δ → π/2.
The results for A(p4 = 0, pv ) and B(p4 = 0, pv ), i.e. on the spacelike axis, are
indeed independent of the angle δ, and purely real, as is shown in the left panel
of Fig. 1. In the right panel, we show our results as function of p4 for pv = 0,
in wich case we do see a dependence on the angle δ, as expected; furthermore,
both A and B develop an imaginary part, which increases in magnitude with
increasing δ. However, as we approach δ = π/2, the numerics becomes unstable
due to singularities in the propagators, which prevents us from actually reaching

8

the timelike axis.

3.2

Rotating the spacelike region to the timelike region

Alternatively, we can rotate the DSE from the Euclidean spacelike axis towards
the timelike axis by applying the transformation
p → e−iδ p ,

k → e−iδ k ,

dk → e−iδ dk ,

(22)

on the magnitude of the (Euclidean) four-vectors, while continuing to use 4dimensional hyperspherical coordinates, as was done in e.g. Refs. [8, 9]. With
this technique we keep p and k real (and positive), and we retain the 4-dimensional
symmetry. As long as the contribution along the arc at k = ∞ vanishes (and
with the explicit PV regularization it does), we can neglect the contribution
along this arc, and keep only the integration over k from 0 to ∞.
In the limit of δ = π/2 this transformation becomes
p2E → −p2E = p2 ,

Note Eqs. (24) and (25) are for timelike momenta only, p2 ≥ 0, k 2 ≥ 0, and
q 2 = (p − k)2 ≥ 0 – they are different from the DSEs in Minkowski metric,
Eqs. (5) and (6). (Again singularities under the integrals are specified by the iǫ
prescription.)
For any 0 < δ < π/2, this method gives the DSE along a line from 0 to
∞ in the upper complex p2 plane, rather than on a slice of the upper complex
momentum plane. Furthermore, it remains an integral equation in one variable,
rather than in two variables as with the method described in the previous subsection. This method is therefore numerically easier to implement, and leads to
better numerical precision.
In the right panel of Fig. 1, we also include our results obtained with this
method. Not surprisingly, the results of the two methods are essentially indistinguishable, at least at the scale shown. However, the method of rotating the
magnitude of p is much more accurate (for a similar numerical effort) than the
explicit un-Wick rotation of the fourth component, because when we un-Wick
rotate the fourth component, we break the 4-dimensional symmetry by treating

9

Dyson–Schwinger Equations through un-Wick rotation

the fourth component and the 3-vector components differently. Furthermore,
we solve the propagator functions A and B as functions of two independent
real variables, p4 and pv , for a given angle δ (or equivalently, as function of one
complex variable p2 = p24 ei 2δ + p2v ), whereas if we rotate the magnitude of p
the functions A and B remain function of only one essentially real variable. In
particular, as δ approaches π/2, in the case of the un-Wick rotation we solve
the DSE in the entire upper p2 plane, whereas if we rotate the magnitude of p,
we solve the DSE along a line from 0 to ∞ close to the timelike axis. Clearly,
the latter approach is more efficient numerically.

(dashed) and B (solid), at different angles θ close to the timelike axis. Both
figures are with m0 = 0.5 and PV mass Λ = 10; and exchange mass µ = 1.0
and α = 0.5 (left) and massless vector boson and α = 0.1 (right).
In order to discuss our results as we approach the timelike region, it is more
convenient to use θ = π/2 − δ; with this notation the timelike axis corresponds
to the limit θ → 0. For moderate values of the coupling (well below those
corresponding to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking), we can achieve accurate
results down to θ = π/256 ≈ 0.7◦ by rotating the magnitude of p, whereas if
we decrease θ below about θ = π/16 ≈ 11◦ , the un-Wick rotation becomes
numerically challenging, requiring an effecient implementation on parallel highperformance computing systems.
In Fig. 2 we see that the imaginary parts of A(p2 ) and B(p2 ) become nonzero
along the timelike axis. Furthermore, both the real parts and the imaginary
parts of A(p2 ) and B(p2 ) develop kinks, that is, discontinuities in their derivatives. The location of these kinks is determined by the physical thresholds for
the production of an exchange particle; these kinks occur at (mphys + µ)2 and
(mphys + Λ)2 , where the pole mass
p mphys is determined from the zero of the
2
inverse propagator, at M (p ) = p2 .

Figure 3: Real and imaginary parts of the dynamical mass squared, M 2 (p2 )
(solid), and wave function renormalization, Z(p2 ) = 1/A(p2 ) (dashed), in the
spacelike and close to the timelike axis, again with m0 = 0.5 and PV mass Λ =
10. The extracted pole masses and residues are: m = 0.759 and Z(m2 ) = 0.82
for mass µ = 1.0 and α = 0.5 (left) and m = 0.58 and Z(m2 ) = 0.34 for massless
vector boson and α = 0.1 (right).
These kinks are generally attributed to the integration over the propagator
poles in Eqs. (5) and (6), where one (or more) denominator becomes zero.
Mathematically, the kinks are caused by a pinch singularity due to the zeros of
the exchange boson propagator and the fermion propagator in Eqs. (5) and (6).

4.1

Analytic structure and pole mass

In Fig. 3 we show our results for M 2 (p2 ) and Z(p2 ) = 1/A(p2 ) in the infrared
region. The fermion propagator has a singularity at p2 = M 2 (p2 ) = m2phys in the
timelike region. With a nonzero mass for the exchange boson, this singularity
is a simple mass-pole (at least in Feynman gauge) – but neither the inverse
propagator functions A2 (p2 ) and B(p2 ), nor the dynamical mass function M (p2 )
shows any discontinuity or kink at this mass-pole.
The first kink or branch-point in the inverse propagator functions is located
at (mphys + µ)2 ≥ m2phys , as marked by the vertical dotted line in Fig. 3. At
this kink, both the propagator itself and the inverse propagator functions have
a branch-point, at which point the imaginary part becomes nonzero. With
a nonzero exchange mass µ, this kink occurs well beyond the mass-pole at
p2 = M 2 (p2 ), and both the propagator and the inverse propagator functions are
finite at this branch-point. However, in the limit of µ → 0, this branch-point
coincides with the mass-pole singularity, as can be seen in the right panel of
Fig. 3. Consequently, the propagator exhibits a more complicated singularity
instead of a simple mass-pole, at which point the inverse propagator is zero, and
a branch-cut starts along the timelike axis. The sign of the imaginary part is a
consequence of the iǫ prescription – or in the case of the un-Wick rotation, of
the direction of the rotation.
Due to the PV regularization, the (inverse) propagator has a second kink

along the timelike axis, located at (mphys + Λ)2 , beyond which the imaginary
parts fall off to zero, and the real parts of the (inverse) fermion propagator
approach their bare (tree-level) values, see Fig. 2.

Spectral representation of the self-energy

self-energies can be written as

In Fig. 4 we show on the left approximations to the spectral functions ρA,B
obtained from the imaginary parts of A and B at different angles θ close to the
timelike axis. (Note that the angle θ is defined as the rotation angle for p0 or the
magnitude of p; in terms of the variable s used in the spectral representation,
this corresponds to an angle 2θ.) The right panel confirms that in the limit
of θ → 0, these approximate spectral functions can indeed reproduce the Euclidean (spacelike) to high accuracy. With a more careful analysis and using a
Mellin transformation, we can use these ‘approximate spectral representations’
at nonzero values of θ to calculate the self-energies in the entire slice of the
upper complex p2 plane, bounded by the real spacelike axis (negative p2 ) and
the line p2 ei 2θ . More details will be presented in Ref. [26].

Conclusion and outlook

This contribution presents a preliminary study of the nonperturbative fermion
propagator in both the spacelike and near the timelike regions by investigating the fermion DSE in rainbow-ladder truncation in the Feynman gauge in a
QED-like theory. Two methods to solve the Pauli–Villars regulated DSE were
implemented to obtain the self-energies near the timelike axis, both relying on an
analytic continuation of the Euclidean DSE into the complex momentum plane.
In the first approach the energy component of the four-momenta are complexrotated to bring the Euclidean formulation towards the Minkowski metric, while
in the second method the magnitude of the four-vector p is complex-rotated to
rotate the spacelike axis towards the timelike axis. Both methods were used
to compute the Dirac scalar and vector self-energies of the fermion near the
timelike region. The second method showed to be much more accurate allowing
calculations with angles as small as θ = π/256 ≈ 0.7◦ , quite close to the timelike
axis. This is natural as with a fixed angle, in the first method the DSE has to
be solved as function of two real variables, while in the second approach the
scalar and vector self-energies depend on only one real variable, allowing a finer
grid in this one variable.
The coupling constant was chosen sufficiently large for the solutions to allow
for noticably nonperturbative effects, while below the value for dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking. With a massive vector boson, the obtained nonperturbative
fermion propagator has a mass-pole at p2 = M 2 (p2 ) = m2phys on the timelike
axis, followed by a branch-cut starting at p2 = (mphys + µ)2 . With massless
bosons, µ = 0, this branch-cut starts at the physical mass, and the mass-pole
becomes a more complicated singularity. Finally, the imaginary part of the
self-energies along the timelike axis were used to obtain the spectral densities,
from which the spacelike self-energies were computed in good agreement with
the Euclidean self-energies.
In the future, we intend to explore in more detail the analytic structure of
the fermion propagator in the complex plane by, e.g., generalizing the spectral
representation with finite θ associated with the study the solutions of Laplace
equations using Mellin transform [26]; we also plan to extend these investigations
to other gauges, in particular the Landau gauge, and to other theories. The next
step will be to use these nonperturbative propagators in Minkowski metric for
bound state calculations and to explore hadron structure directly in Minkowski
space.
