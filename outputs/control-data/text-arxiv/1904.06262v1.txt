Abstract
We measure NUV aperture magnitudes from GALEX images for 258 ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates
drawn from the initial SMUDGes survey of ∼ 300 square degrees surrounding, and including, the Coma galaxy
cluster. For the vast majority, 242 of them, we present flux upper limits due either to a lack of significant flux in
the aperture or confusion with other objects projected within the aperture. These limits often place interesting
constraints on the UDG candidates, indicating that they are non-star forming or quiescent. In particular, we identify field, quiescent UDG candidates, which are a challenge for formation models and are therefore compelling
prospects for spectroscopic follow-up and distance determinations. We present FUV and NUV magnitudes for
16 detected UDG candidates and compare those galaxies to the local population of galaxies on color-magnitude
and specific star formation rate diagrams. The NUV detected UDG candidates form mostly an extension toward
lower stellar masses of the star forming galaxy sequence and none of these lie within regions of high local galaxy
density. UDG candidates span a range of properties, although almost all are consistent with being quiescent,
low surface brightness galaxies, regardless of environment.

1. Introduction

Physically large, and possibly massive, low surface brightness galaxies, recently coined as ultra-diffuse galaxies
(UDGs; van Dokkum et al. 2015), are potentially unique
testing grounds for theories of galaxy formation (e.g. Yozin
& Bekki 2015; Amorisco & Loeb 2016; Agertz & Kravtoc 2016; Di Cintio et al. 2017; Rong et al. 2017; Chan et al.
2018; Carleton et al. 2018) and the nature of dark matter (e.g.
Bernal et al. 2018). Low surface brightness galaxies, even
physically large ones, have been known to exist for decades
(e.g. Sandage & Binggeli 1984; Impey et al. 1988; Conselice
et al. 2003), but the novel and compelling development is that
the largest among these appear to inhabit massive dark matter halos, such that their mass-to-light ratios are comparable
to those of the most dark matter dominated dwarf spheroidal
satellites of our Galaxy.
Evidence supporting the large inferred masses comes from
kinematic measurements of integrated starlight (van Dokkum
et al. 2016) and of globular clusters (Beasley et al. 2016),
and from the size of their globular cluster populations (van
Dokkum et al. 2017). There are caveats associated with the
interpretation of both the kinematics, which are measured at
small radii necessitating significant extrapolation to estimate
total masses, and the globular cluster counts, which adopt
large completeness corrections and assume that the relationship between the number of globular clusters and total mass
(Blakeslee et al. 1997; Georgiev et al. 2010; Harris et al.
2013; Forbes et al. 2016; Harris et al. 2017; Zaritsky et al.

2017; Forbes et al. 2018) holds for UDGs. Even so, it is only
the physically largest UDGs that appear to be this extreme in
their total mass, while the physically smaller, more common
among them appear to have lower masses that are consistent
with those of dwarf galaxies (Amorisco et al. 2018; Sifón et
al. 2018). Therefore, much of the population of UDGs is
likely to overlap what had been previously referred to as low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxies (Disney 1976; Schombert
& Bothun 1988; Schwartzenberg et al. 1995; Sprayberry et
al. 1997; Dalcanton et al. 1997; Conselice et al. 2003).
Large area photometric surveys are now uncovering
LSBs/UDGs by the hundreds and thousands in a variety of
environments (eg. Yagi et al. 2016; van der Burg et al. 2016;
Greco et al. 2018; Zaritsky et al. 2018). Such surveys are
crucial if one wants to compile a large sample of the largest,
most massive UDGs — the objects that are truly unusual and
most likely to place demanding constraints on both models
of galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the lack of
redshifts and other ancillary data for nearly all UDG candidates means that these objects are solely defined by surface
brightness and angular size, leading to what is likely to be a
heterogeneous population (Zaritsky 2017; Greco et al. 2018;
Ferré-Mateu et al. 2018; Lim et al. 2018), thereby mitigating
their value as probes of galaxy evolution and dark matter.
Measuring redshifts is currently the limiting factor in utilizing UDGs to advance our understanding of galaxy properties. Optical spectroscopy is expensive, requiring multiple
hours per object on our largest ground-based telescopes (eg.

2
van Dokkum et al. 2015; Kadowaki et al. 2017) and neutral
hydrogen observations yield redshifts only for the small fraction of UDG candidates with gas (Spekkens & Karunakaran
2018). Guidance regarding the most promising candidates to
target for the expensive spectroscopic follow-up would help
mitigate the cost of the observations. Projected membership
in a galaxy cluster or group has been one adopted approach,
nearly guaranteeing that the adopted distance is the true distance (eg. Kadowaki et al. 2017; Alabi et al. 2018). However,
such galaxies have evolved within a dynamical environment,
complicating the interpretation of their evolution and structure.
Because of the common focus on UDGs in galaxy clusters,
due to the question of distances and observational efficiency,
those systems are better characterized than UDGs in low density environments. UDGs in clusters are almost exclusively
red, consistent with being quiescent (Yagi et al. 2016; van
der Burg et al. 2016). This empirical finding has led to speculation that the evolution of these galaxies is guided by tidal
effects, ram pressure gas loss, environmental “strangulation",
and basically all of the phenomena that are speculated to alter high brightness galaxies in clusters (cf. Boselli & Gavazzi
2006). In contrast, the small number of UDGs spectroscopically confirmed to lie in the field are optically bluer (Zaritsky
et al. 2018) and sometimes have associated HI (Leisman et al.
2017; Spekkens & Karunakaran 2018). In fact, several UDG
origin scenarios predict an absence of red UDGs in the field
(eg. Di Cintio et al. 2017; Chan et al. 2018). Unfortunately,
the field UDG population is poorly studied.
The use of existing ultraviolet imaging from the GALEX
(Martin et al. 2005) mission archive is an efficient way to
measure the prevalence of recent star formation in UDGs
across all environments. The use of UV flux to form a UVoptical color has the advantage that it is far more sensitive
to recent star formation than are optical colors, while it has
the disadvantage that it is in general much more challenging
to measure. The GALEX archive was already examined by
Greco et al. (2018) in relation to their catalog of low surface brightness galaxies. They find a high detection fraction, 76%, among their optically blue sample, although the
UDG selection criteria are different between their sample and
SMUDGes. For example, Greco et al. (2018) include systems of smaller angular extent and base their surface brightness criteria on a mean surface brightness within the effective radius rather than a central surface brightness. Here we
investigate whether the set of UDG candidates released in
the first SMUDGes catalog (Zaritsky et al. 2018) has NUV
counterparts, what the properties of those systems are, and
interpret the limits from those that are not detected. In §2
we describe our analysis of the GALEX data and how we obtain our photometry. In §3 we present our results, particularly
the distribution of UDGs in color-magnitude space relative to
“normal" local galaxies and the spatial distribution of various
UDG subclasses.

We begin with the UDG catalog from Zaritsky et al. (2018)
of 275 UDG candidates with half light radii, rh , & 5.300 that
lie within roughly a 10◦ projected radius from the Coma
galaxy cluster. One key difference between SMUDGes and
other UDG catalogs is that the angular criterion corresponds
to a physical effective radius, for those objects at the distance
of the Coma cluster, of 2.5 kpc rather than the canonical 1.5
kpc. For example, in terms of angular size alone, we select
objects whose minimum size is over twice that set by Greco
et al. (2018). There is no physically motivated justification
for either size criterion, but we choose to focus our effort on
the candidates that are more likely to be physically larger.
The projected virial radius of the Coma cluster is ∼ 1.7◦
(Kubo et al. 2007) so the bulk of the survey volume is well
outside of the cluster, with 67% of the UDG candidates in
the Zaritsky et al. (2018) sample projected beyond the Coma
cluster virial radius.
From the Zaritsky et al. (2018) catalog, we extract the coordinates, the half light radii, and the optical magnitudes. We
choose to use the r-band primarily, although g and z are also
measured in SMUDGes, for comparison to existing work
and because r provides a compromise between providing the
longest wavelength baseline in combination with NUV and
the highest signal-to-noise.
The NUV data come from the NASA public archive portal
MAST1 of the GALEX mission (Martin et al. 2005). GALEX
was a 50 cm diameter UV telescope capable of imaging the
sky in FUV (1350-1750 Å) and NUV (1750-2750 Å) bands
simultaneously. We exclude UDG candidates without available r band or that lie outside available GALEX images, and
our final sample consists of 258 candidates. As discussed
below, detections were sufficiently uncommon in the NUV
band that we do not present results for the FUV band for the
full sample. The image database is not of uniform depth and
so detection thresholds vary across the sample.
To determine whether we detect each individual candidate in the available data, we used the Astropy (The Astropy
Collaboration 2018) affiliated package Photutils2 to perform
photometry on the NUV data at each candidate’s location.
We define a circular aperture of radius 2re , where re is the
optical half light radius of the target, and measure the flux
in the NUV intensity map from which we subtract the background flux. We determine the background flux by measuring the flux within the same circular aperture in the GALEXprovided sky background image. We convert from counts per
second (CPS) to an NUV magnitude in the AB system (Oke
1964; Oke & Gunn 1983) using the equation
mAB = −2.5 × log10 (CP S) + 20.08,

(Morrissey et al. 2005).
To check that the background image is uncontaminated by
the UDG candidate itself and to account for the effect of variations in the background map, we recompute mN U V after

displacing the background aperture, starting from a displacement of 2rh and increasing to 10rh in α and δ. Although the
change in magnitude tends to increase with the displacement,
the absolute value of the difference is < 0.1 mag for the vast
majority (ranging from 240 out of 258 for the smallest displacements to 200 out of 258 for the largest).
The point spread function (PSF) for the GALEX NUV images is 6.000 FWHM (Martin et al. 2005), which can lead to
confusion among sources and strong contamination in some
cases. In our first step to mitigate this problem, we compute
the ratio of the flux obtained within an aperture of radius 2rh
to that obtained within an aperture of radius rh . We reject
candidates where this ratio is > 4. We visually confirmed that
this criterion identifies strongly contaminated objects. Fiftythree candidates are classified as strongly contaminated and
not considered further. Other candidates where this ratio is
< 4 may nevertheless suffer more subtle contamination and
we discuss that problem further below.
Among the remaining sources, we expect our uncertainties
to be dominated by the uncertainty in the background determination. To estimate the mean background uncertainty,
we measure the scatter in fluxes obtained from visuallyinspected uncontaminated sky regions. We identify 40 blank
apertures (of equal size) and measure the enclosed flux.
We then compute the standard deviation, σsky , by fitting
a Gaussian to the resulting distribution of measured fluxes
among the apertures. We define
p the mean background uncertainty per pixel to be σsky Nsky , where Nsky is the
number of pixels in the sky aperture. The uncertainty in
the mean
level within a target aperture is then
p background
p
σsky Nsky / Ntarget , where Ntarget is the number of pixels in the target aperture. If there is a large scale gradient to
the background, then our method for estimating the uncertainties will overestimate the background uncertainty locally.
However, we cannot be sure that the background gradient is
real or systematic and our method captures this uncertainty.
To ascertain our confidence in a source detection, we define the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for each candidate UDG
detection, ignoring the uncertainty contribution from the
source itself and any faint contaminating objects, as
SNR =

candidate flux
.
background uncertainty

(2)

We consider sources with SNR<2 to be non-detections and
visually inspect all others. While visually inspecting the can-

didates with SNR≥2, we consider how well centered the object is, the extent of the object, and the possible contaminating effects of the neighbors on the photometry. If we conclude that the detection cannot be confidently assigned to the
UDG candidate, we label that as a non-detection. For all
sources that are classified as non-detections, we either accept
the measured flux as an upper limit on the flux or, in cases,
where the measured flux is negative, we assign a value of
twice the background uncertainty to be the flux upper limit.
In cases where we suspect contamination, the measured flux
is a conservative upper limit because we have not attempted
to correct for the contaminating object.
After rejecting 53 candidates on the basis of our initial contamination criterion and 17 candidates without either NUV
images or r−band data, we have 16 detections and 189 nondetections (the effect of different criteria on the final set of
detected candidates is summarized in Table 1). The NUV
images for the 16 detections are presented in Figure 1. For
those detected in NUV, we also measure the FUV magnitude
using the same procedure. In Table 2 we present the extinction corrected values of the NUV and FUV magnitudes for
those same UDG candidates and r−band magnitudes using
published reddening maps (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011) and
the following selective extinction relations
AN U V /E(B − V ) = 8.2, AF U V /E(B − V ) = 8.24,
and Ar /E(B − V ) = 2.28,
(3)
as also adopted by Wyder et al. (2007). We present the lower
limits on mF U V for the objects that are not visually discernable in the FUV band. Table 3 uses a similar format and
contains the extinction corrected mN U V limits for the nondetections.
Some of the detections could be chance coincidences with
other UV-emitting objects. To gauge the magnitude of this
effect, we placed random apertures within the same set of
GALEX images and found that ∼ 15% of the time the detected flux satisfies our initial SNR > 2 criterion. After visual examination, only ∼ 20% of those are sufficiently wellcentered and uncontaminated. In combination, these results
suggest that 3% of our UDG candidates (8 out of 258) could
have false superpositions. Accounting for the fraction of contaminated sources, we conclude that 6 of our 16 detections
might be attributable to superpositions.
In contrast, some of the non-detections could be chance
coincidences of emitting sources with strong, negative noise
fluctuations. However, given our few detections, we do not
expect there to be a significant population of such objects.
Assuming that the positive superpositions discussed above
are matched by negative ones, which is overly conservative
because real sources contribute to positive fluctuations but
not to negative ones, we cap the fraction of such events at
∼ 15%. Given 10 to 16 detected sources, we expect to have
“lost" one to two sources that we would have otherwise detected.

Figure 1. Images of the 16 candidate UDGs for which we measure a significant NUV flux that is visually related to the optical detection. The angular scale of
the images vary, but coordinates are given. The white circles are centered on the optical location of the UDG candidate and have a radius of 2rh . Candidates are
presented in order of increasing right ascension from left to right and downward.

NUV detections from candidate UDGs drawn from the
SMUDGes catalog in GALEX images are rare. We identify
only 16 out of 258 (6%), or only 10 (4%) if we account for
the possibility of source superposition. Of course, there are
a variety of possible reasons for why the remaining systems
have low UV fluxes, but even the limits convey information.
3.1. Distribution in Color-Magnitude Space
In Figure 2 we compare the distribution of both our detections and limits for non-detections to the distribution measured for the local galaxy population by Wyder et al. (2007),
assuming that the candidate UDGs lie at the distance of the
Coma cluster. Zaritsky et al. (2018) provide evidence suggesting this is likely to be the correct distance for most, but
not all, of the UDG candidates within this first released survey area. Errors in distance affect only the location of the
candidate UDG along the abscissa and so do not significantly

impact what we conclude next. We expect errors in our assigned distances to be mostly overestimates because placing
the candidates beyond Coma would imply even larger physical sizes.
In Figure 2, we outline with blue and red dashed lines
possible extrapolations of the blue cloud and red sequence
galaxy populations. The equations for the top and bottom
red dashed lines are
(N U V − r) = −0.267Mr + 0.733,
(N U V − r) = −0.262Mr − 0.707,

(5)

and the equations for top and bottom blue dashed lines are
(N U V − r) = −0.067Mr + 1.534,
(N U V − r) = −0.078Mr − 0.416,
respectively.

For the red sequence, we deliberately define an extreme
possibility of a highly tilted red sequence, for which there is
a hint in the Wyder et al. (2007) data and which provides the
most optimistic possibility for detecting red sequence UDGs
in GALEX data. Even so, we have only one detection that
might lie on the red sequence. It is evident from this comparison, that we should not expect to detect UDGs that are not
forming stars in these GALEX images.
The bulk of the detections lie in an area of the diagram
consistent with an extrapolation of the blue cloud, suggesting
that at least these objects are forming stars. However, 135
of the 189 non-detections have lower limits on NUV−r that
place them redder than the blue cloud, demonstrating that
the majority of the candidates are not star-forming, low mass
galaxies. Selecting objects that are large in angular extent

Figure 2. A comparison of luminous galaxies and our UDGs. The isodensity contours represent the volume density of local galaxies in this colormagnitude space as derived by Wyder et al. (2007). Our detections are
shown as filled circles and the color limits from our non-detections are
shown as upward pointing triangles and illustrate the allowed direction for
those points to migrate. Our detections are mostly consistent with the field
blue population, although pushing to fainter galaxies than examined in the
previous study.

3.2. Stacking Analysis
To examine the nature of the non-detections in the extrapolated red and blue sequences of Figure 2, we first average
their flux limits and propagate uncertainties to determine if it
is feasible to detect an object in the image stack of these candidates if they all have the maximum allowed flux. For the
red sequence non-detections, we find that even a stack all of
such sources will have insufficient signal for a detection. For
the blue sequence non-detections, excluding the one bright
UDG candidate at Mr ∼ −20, we find that we could detect
the stacked object, provided the objects are not much fainter
than the NUV limits.
Our stack of the images of the UDG candidates whose
NUV limits potentially place them in the blue cloud region
of Figure 2 does result in a detected central object. The stack
might include contaminating objects, which we have no way
of excluding, and therefore our detection should be treated
as a lower limit on NUV−r. Even so, our measurement
(NUV−r ∼ 4.5) places the mean object on the red sequence
rather than in the blue cloud, suggesting that the majority of
the objects contributing to the stack must be on the red sequence. Because we now exclude even most non-detections
from the blue cloud, we conclude that the bulk of our UDG
candidates are indeed quiescent.

Figure 3. The distribution on the sky of NUV detected (solid circles) and
non-detected UDG candidates (open triangles). The Coma cluster is the
central concentration of UDG candidates, with the large circle representing
the virial radius. No NUV detections lie within the densest concentration and
so NUV strong objects are manifestly underrepresented in this environment.

In Figure 3 we present the spatial distribution of the UDG
candidates, coded by whether or not we detect NUV flux.
The few detections that lie close to the Coma cluster in projection lie on the periphery. The candidate UDGs for which
we were unable to make a measurement because they lacked
either GALEX imaging or r−band data are distributed randomly across the survey area and are not shown in the Figure. The UDG candidates outside of Coma are also predominantly non-detections.
A concern in interpreting the distribution of non-detections
is that a fraction of these sources were rejected due to possible contamination. As such, some could have significant
NUV flux. Furthermore, it is possible that within regions
of high galaxy density we are more likely to identify possible contaminating sources within the aperture. However, we
visually rejected only 5 sources within the Coma virial radius. We rejected 16 outside of Coma. The vast majority
of UDG candidates (110) within the Coma virial radius had
no detectable flux. We conclude that the lack of candidates
identified as NUV detections within the Coma cluster is not
due to a bias caused by increased contamination within the
measurement apertures.
A second potential concern is that the NUV survey depth is
uneven across the field. However, the high density areas that
proportionally lack NUV detections, the Coma cluster and
the area toward the right of Figure 3, tend to have the deeper
GALEX imaging available than the low density areas. We
conclude that survey depth variations are not responsible for
the relative lack of NUV detections in dense environments.
In Figure 4 we show the spatial distribution of a subset of
UDG candidates, those that lie either within our extrapolated
red sequence or blue cloud regions in Figure 2. Because the
majority of these points represents limits on the color, the
blue cloud points could represent red UDG candidates, while

the red sequence points are securely red. The Coma cluster
is dominated by the presence of red sequence galaxies. This
confirms the findings of van der Burg et al. (2016) who, on
the basis of optical colors, concluded that cluster UDGs are
nearly all quiescent. There is an apparent over representation
of red UDG candidates also in the overdensity on the right of
Figure 4, and a relative overabundance of blue points in the
field. However, we know from our stacking analysis that the
bulk of these are also quiescent galaxies.
A particularly interesting population of objects are those
UDG candidates for which the NUV−r color limit constrains
them to be a quiescent field UDG candidate. These are confidently identified as both quiescent and outside of a dense
galaxy environment. Because we do not know their distance,
we cannot confirm that they are indeed UDGs rather than
dwarf elliptical/spheroidal galaxies. Nevertheless, there are
∼ 24 UDG candidates that lie at least 3 virial radii in projected separation from Coma, beyond where cluster effects
are observed and theorized to end (cf. Gómez et al. 2003;
Zinger et al. 2018) and are confirmed as red for which redshifts would be particularly valuable. GALEX screening of
the larger samples expected from the SMUDGes survey will
be an efficient way to identify quiescent field UDG candidates. In the entire sample, again assuming that these lie at
the distance of the Coma cluster, 8 detections and 21 nondetections belong to UDGs that have rh > 4 kpc. Seven from
the latter category lie well outside both the Coma cluster and
the galaxy concentration seen toward the right of Figure 4.

3.4. Star Formation Rates
Interpreting the NUV flux as originating from young stars,
we proceed to estimate the stellar mass normalized star for-

7

SFR (M yr−1 ) = 1.0 × 10−28 Lν (ergs s−1 Hz−1 )

(8)

as adopted by Wyder et al. (2007). To estimate the stellar
mass, we first calculate the mass to light ratio (M/L) from
the g − z color using the relation
log10 (M/L) = −0.171 + 0.322 × (g − z)

(9)

from Bell et al. (2003). The g and z magnitudes for the UDGs
are given by Zaritsky et al. (2018) and extinction corrected.
The stellar mass is then estimated by taking the product of
M/L with the z band luminosity. The Bell et al. (2003) relation was not derived including UDG stellar populations, but
the uncertainty in M/L is small in comparison to the range of
SFRs. The sSFR is then simply given by the ratio of the SFR
to the stellar mass.
We also calculated the sSFR using a more recent color stellar mass relation derived by Roediger & Courteau (2015)
to check the effect of using a different stellar mass estimator. Although, the new transformation noticeably moves the
UDG candidates in the stellar mass - specific star formation
rate space (the mean fractional change decreases the stellar
mass by 46%), the overall distribution remains almost the
same and hence does not affect the qualitative results that we
present next.
We compare the calculated sSFR’s for the 16 detected
UDG candidates to the distribution of values found for local galaxies by Schiminovich et al. (2007) in Figure 5. The
distribution of UDGs outlines the upper boundary of the region in this diagram that is populated by the UDG candidates
from the SMUDGes survey. At the bluest end, the detected
UDGs with the highest sSFR’s almost reach the star forming
sequence, suggesting that at the lowest stellar masses we detect the galaxies can be hosting relatively high specific star
formation rates and still satisfy our surface brightness selection criteria. However, at most ∼ 10 out of the 258 UDG
candidates are in this category, demonstrating that the UDG
selection criteria is not broadly detecting field star forming
dwarfs. Although field UDGs, as defined by the SMUDGes
criteria, are generally optically bluer than their cluster counterparts (Zaritsky et al. 2018), they are not low mass galaxies
on the star forming sequence. They might possibly tend to
be lower stellar mass, and hence lower metallicity, systems.
At the high stellar mass end, we are just able to detect in
GALEX images objects near the quiescent sequence. The
remainder of our detections lie somewhere between the two
extremes. The non-detections will fill in the lower left of this
diagram, but significantly deeper NUV imaging is necessary
to place those objects on this diagram. Distance errors, if the

UDG candidates are actually closer than the assumed Coma
cluster distance, will move objects to the left in the diagram
but do not qualitatively affect our conclusions.
Returning to the question of whether the NUV flux
originates from ongoing star formation, we examine the
FUV−NUV color for the NUV-detected objects. All but
two of the detections are red in FUV−NUV (> 1), suggesting that the sSFR’s estimated using the NUV fluxes are
overestimates of the current sSFR. Such red colors are consistent with those measured for LSB galaxies (Boissier et al.
2008; Wyder et al. 2009). Although the UDG colors appear
to be somewhat redder on average than those published for
the LSBs, the reddest among our systems have the largest
uncertainties and, within 2σ, are consistent with the LSB
colors. Interpreting our measurements of sSFR as upper limits, places even more of the NUV-detected objects into the
quiescent category. Only in two cases are the FUV−NUV
colors consistent with ongoing star formation. This confirms
our general result that the SMUDGes UDGs are almost exclusively non-star forming systems in all environments and is
consistent with the previous determination that low surface
brightness galaxies have lower star formation efficiencies
than high surface brightness galaxies (Wyder et al. 2009).

mation rate, or specific star formation rate (sSFR). These estimates provide an upper limit on the current sSFR because
the NUV flux can also originate from somewhat older stars.
We will return to this topic farther below when we discuss the
FUV−NUV colors. Measurements of the sSFR were done
for the local galaxy population by Schiminovich et al. (2007),
and we follow their approach. We obtain the star formation
rate (SFR) from the NUV flux using the relation

et al. (2007) and the blue dots represent our candidate UDG detections. We
estimate the stellar masses using the relationships presented by Bell et al.
(2003) and the UDGs move by ∼ 0.33 upward and to the left if we use the
relationships presented by Roediger & Courteau (2015).

4. Conclusions

We present NUV measurements from GALEX images of
the NUV fluxes or flux limits for the sample of ultra-diffuse
galaxies (UDGs) presented by the SMUDGes survey (Zaritsky et al. 2018). Of the 258 UDG candidates that have
the necessary GALEX imaging and r−band photometry,
we reject 53 as being strongly contaminated by a nearby

8
source, measure a statistically significant NUV flux, and
hence NUV−r color, for 16, and place limits on the NUV
flux for the remaining 189.
For a subset of the non-detections the limits are sufficiently
constraining that we conclude that they are quiescent galaxies. Furthermore, some of these lie well outside of any high
galaxy density region, making those objects prime candidates
for quiescent, field UDGs. It is important to measure the distances to these objects and determine whether these are indeed physically large galaxies. Models of UDG formation
find it challenging to produce quiescent, large, field, low surface brightness galaxies.
None of the NUV detected objects are in regions of high
density, confirming conclusions reached using optical photometry that UDGs within clusters are quiescent. Furthermore, our analysis of the image stack of candidate UDGs
whose photometric limits did not preclude them from being
star forming objects yielded an NUV flux measurement that
demonstrated that the majority of the objects in that stack
are actually quiescent as well. Lastly, only two of the NUV
detected UDGs have FUV−NUV colors consistent with ongoing star formation. We conclude that the vast majority of
the SMUDGes UDG candidates are quiescent, independent
of environment.
GALEX archival imaging provides valuable ancillary information that can relatively easily help identify key sub populations from the large number of UDG candidates that ongoing surveys will identify.
