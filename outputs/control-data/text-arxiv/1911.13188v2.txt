Abstract The Baryon acoustic oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO) telescope is a 40-m class radio telescope under construction that has been designed to measure the large-angular-scale intensity of Hi
emission at 980–1260 MHz and hence to constrain dark energy parameters. A
large focal plane array comprising of 1.7-metre diameter, 4.3-metre length corrugated feed horns is required in order to optimally illuminate the telescope.
Additionally, very clean beams with low sidelobes across a broad frequency
range are required, in order to facilitate the separation of the faint Hi emission
from bright Galactic foreground emission. Using novel construction methods,

1 Introduction
The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO) telescope [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will observe integrated Hi signals in the
redshift range z = 0.13–0.48 to constrain the properties of the Dark Sector [6].
It uses the concept of “single dish, many horns”, with a pair of 40-m mirrors
and approximately 50 horns in a compact range layout to observe the redshifted 1420 MHz Hi line emission at frequencies of 980–1260 MHz. Using the
Hi emission line as a proxy for total matter observation, the BINGO telescope
will probe the redshift range where dark energy becomes dominant. This will
be complementary to other large-scale structure projects operating at optical
or other radio frequencies.
Very clean optics with low sidelobes is a critical part of the telescope design
to achieve the high contrast ratio between the bright foregrounds and the faint
Hi signals. This contrast will allow component separation techniques to work
efficiently [7, 8, 9], as well as reduce sensitivity to sources of radio frequency
interference [10]. A compact range layout (crossed-Dragone) meets these requirements, but it needs very large horns with apertures of around 2 m to
provide the relatively small beamwidths necessary to appropriately illuminate
the secondary mirror. These horns also need to have very low sidelobes to
reduce ground pickup.
Manufacturing smooth-sided large horns with narrow bandwidths is relatively simple. Illustrative cases are the horns being used for military radars
and the horn used in Bell Labs for the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation [11]. However, a corrugated horn is needed to cover
the large frequency range while maintaining the beam performance needed
for BINGO. These are common for small to medium-sized horns (e.g., [12,
13]), but not for the >1 m-diameter required for BINGO, leading to the novel
construction approach described below.
An exception is the L-band horn for EVLA [14], produced by the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and briefly discussed at the end of
Subsection 3.2. It has a comparable size at similar frequencies to BINGO, but
has a different design and uses a slightly different method of fabrication.
In this paper we summarise the design, construction and testing of a
BINGO prototype horn and polariser. Section 2 presents the requirements
for the horn with the chosen optical design. Section 3 discusses the challenges

BINGO Broadband corrugated horn construction and testing

of constructing the large horn and the adopted solution. Sections 4 and Section 5 contains, respectively, the methods used for testing the horn and the
polariser connected to it, and the results for both tests. In Section 7 we discuss
future work and present our conclusions.

2 Requirements and optical design
The current optical design for BINGO has a focal length of 63 m. In order
to slightly under-illuminate the secondary mirror, the horns need to have an
aperture of around 2 m and it is this large size that presents a significant
construction challenge. With slight under-illumination of the secondary, the
resulting full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the whole telescope is ∼ 400 ,
maintaining the original angular resolution proposed in [2]. The horns need
to have very low sidelobes and the beam to be tapered so the illumination is
more than −20 dB at the edge of the secondary mirror in order to minimize
the spillover, and thus the ground pickup. The resulting very clean beam pattern is vital to enable the faint Hi signal to be efficiently separated from the
bright Galactic foreground emission, whose signal is about 4 orders of magnitude brighter than Hi. Our adopted crossed-Dragone configuration has been a
common choice for many Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments
in the last 15 years (see, e.g., [15, 16, 17]).
Given the bandwidth of 980–1260 MHz, the design that best satisfies the
above requirements across the whole band while having a low ellipticity, a low
cross-polarisation and a low return loss, are corrugated horns. As they operate
at room temperature, the insertion loss should be less than −0.1 dB across the
band, which would limit the increase in the system temperature to around
7 K. To be well matched with the rest of the system, including the receiver,
the horns should ideally have around 30 dB return loss across the band.
With such a large aperture setting the beamwidth of the horn, in order to
limit its length for manufacturing purposes, we had to choose a profile allowing
for a compact horn. Following a previous study [18] which led to a design
adopted for previous instruments (QUIJOTE and QUBIC for instance, [19,
20]), a Winston-like corrugated horn design with a circular aperture has been
adopted for BINGO. This profile led to a maximum diameter of 1725.9 mm
and length of 4300 mm (shown in Fig. 2).
The design was optimised using the mode-matching software CORRUG
(S.M.T Consultancies Ltd.)1 to model the beam and return loss properties.
The corrugations consist of a series of rings with a width (or thickness) of
3.4 cm, corresponding to 1/8 of the wavelength of the central observing frequency of 1.1 GHz. The rings have alternating diameters (listed in Table 1),
creating the corrugation depth (each set for top and bottom of the corrugations). The horn has been designed in order to reach an edge taper below
−20 dB at 19◦ across the whole band (horn beam power at the edge of the

secondary mirror of the telescope). Together with the low sidelobe level (below
−27 dB for the first sidelobe), this results in a spillover below 2%.
Simulations of the beam pattern and return loss were then computed using the 3D Computer Simulation Technology (CST) package for a horn with
the above ring diameters, and are shown in Figure 1. The predicted sidelobe
performance is excellent with the far-out sidelobes at the −40 dB level. On
the other hand, the predicted return loss, particularly at lower frequencies, is
acceptable but less than ideal.
The radio emission from the Galaxy and extragalactic sources has a significant fraction of linear polarization. Moreover, the polarization position angle
can be frequency-dependent due to Faraday rotation and as a consequence,
the measured strength of a linear polarized signal can have an induced frequency dependence that might mimic that from redshifted hydrogen emission.
To eliminate this problem it is desirable to make observations using circular
polarization. For this reason a polariser is connected to the horn to receive
the two hands of circular polarization. The design criteria were that the crosspolarization leakage across the band be less than −20 dB and the return loss
be better than 25 dB.

3 Challenges of horn fabrication
The traditional method to manufacture corrugated horns for radio astronomy
is to use a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine to manufacture it
from a solid block of material. However, it is very expensive and not practical
for the very large horns required for BINGO. Instead, the possibility of constructing them using alternative methods, including layered foam sheets and
aluminum profiles bent to produce the corrugations were investigated.

3.1 Foam sheets
Earlier versions of the BINGO project explored the idea of using sheets of insulating foam. Such sheets are light, inexpensive, widely available and coated

with a thin layer of aluminum foil. Holes of the appropriate diameter could be
cut into each sheet and the exposed edges covered with copper or aluminum
tape to provide a continuous internal conducting surface. Initial tests with a
horn of diameter 0.55 m made up of 78 of these sheets gave excellent results,
with insertion loss around −0.1 dB. Unfortunately scaling up to a diameter of
around 1 m was not so successful: similar performance levels could be achieved
for short periods but not reliably maintained from day to day. Additionally,
such sheets are likely not the best choice to perform under the high temperatures (year average of 26◦ C) on site during the full mission. The findings above
led to the search of an alternative approach.

3.2 Aluminum profiles
One of the alternative construction approaches investigated, and which was
considered the most promising in terms of costs and delivering a lightweight

unit, is to bend relatively thin chair-shaped sections (see inset in Figure 2) of
aluminum into circles of appropriate diameter and then join them together.
This technique was used to produce all the larger diameter rings for a corrugated horn prototype, except for the largest one, which was manufactured
using CNC machines for rigidity. The throat section of the horn was made using annuli cut from aluminum sheets, with a sheet of aluminum bent around
to form the centre of the horn ring, welded together to make a ring. The centre
mounting ring, and the last throat ring, were made with a CNC machine, again
for rigidity (see Figure 3). The rings were joined together either by welding,
riveting or bolting depending on ring diameter.
Preliminary studies indicated that two families of aluminum alloys (5000
and 6000) might have the required properties to be formed into the shaped

any deviations smoothed out (bottom-middle). They are then stacked and riveted to each
other (bottom-right) to form the complete horn

profile. A high level of malleability of the aluminum alloy used for fabrication
was required to withstand cold mechanical conformation without weakening
the material, particularly for the smaller radius profiles. Also relevant is the
hardness of the material, the thickness and internal radii of the profile. This
is important in order to allow the bending of the rings without causing undesirable deformation stress at those edges and the ease at which it can be
welded to close the rings while minimising the deformations in the bent profile.
The chosen alloy was Al5052 and, based on the properties of this material, an
appropriate tool to extrude the profiles could be designed.
Calfer2 , a spin-off company from the Brazilian airplane manufacturing industry, was contacted to produce a prototype horn. This included the manufacturing of the proper tool to bend the profiles into shape according to the
required dimensions and tolerances. The profiles are shown in Figure 4 (topleft). The chair-shaped material with these profiles was then fed through a
bending machine using rollers that were specially designed to accommodate
the profile (Figure 4, top-middle and top-right). Due to the size and tolerances
(better than 1 mm deviation from designed ring dimensions) required by the
BINGO design, it is essential that small deformations, usual in the bending
process, are minimized at the bending and welding stages, reducing finishing
time and final costs.
A single bending tool with three wheels can be adjusted to make rings
with a range of diameters. The end of the rings are welded together, making
use of a rigid template for proper positioning (Figure 4, bottom-left). Heating
of the material during the welding slightly deforms the nearby areas, thus

requiring some rework before assembling the rings (Figure 4, bottom-middle
and bottom-right).
Before assembling the parts, there must be a careful dimensional and visual
inspection of each ring, since access to the interior of the horn is difficult after
the completion of the assembly process. The inner surface finish of each ring
plays an important role in the final performance of the horn. The rings should
not have significant irregularities on their surfaces and were sanded to a smooth
finish. The dimensions were checked on a gauge table after the welding process.
The final assembly of the rings to form the horn was done manually. The
best alignment of the center of all rings was achieved after careful calibration of
the diameters. This ring alignment operation is extremely important because
it can directly influence the electromagnetic performance. Two of the rings,
one at the aperture of the horn and one in the middle, were reinforced to act as
a rigid structure to receive lift lugs for maneuvering the horn after assembly.
The prototype manufactured in this way has a total mass of about 448 kg
(including bolts and lift lugs) with a build accuracy equal to or better than
1.0 mm on average.
As a comparison, the NRAO E-VLA L-band horn is slightly smaller than
the BINGO horn (4.1 m length; 1.5 m aperture diameter). Their horns were
made by stacked aluminum rings and bands, made of separate aluminum alloys, held together with a fiberglass shell on the outside [21], [22]. One of
the aluminum alloys used by NRAO is the same as the one adopted in this
work (6061 and 5052 for the NRAO E-VLA versus 5052 only, for the BINGO
rings). Their assembly process is described in [14], and consists of setting up
pre-produced corrugations in an assembly fixture provided by NRAO. These
corrugations are a mix of fully machined rings and rings made by a combination of sheet metal disks and bands, which also work as flanges to assemble
different sections of the horn.

4 Horn tests
There are three main radio frequency test procedures required to characterise
the performance of a horn. The first is to measure the insertion loss, i.e., the
loss of the signal as it passes through the device. The second is to measure
the return loss, i.e., how much signal is reflected by the horn due to small
impedance mismatches. These measurements of loss were made using an Agilent N5230C PNA-L desktop Vector Network Analyser (VNA). The relevant
S-parameter is S11; when a horn is terminated by a metal reflector S11 gives
the insertion loss and when terminated by an RF absorber, in our measurements a material with trade name Eccosorb, S11 measures the return loss.The
third measurement on the horn is the characterisation of the beam pattern
which is done using a specialised feed testing facility. These need to be measured across the frequency range over which the horn is required to operate.
Also in this section we describe measurements of the waveguide transitions

which were required to make the horn polar diagram measurements. All the
loss measurements for transitions were made with the same VNA.

4.1 Transitions
A selection of waveguide transitions is required for different purposes. A circularto-rectangular transition was required to connect the horn to a rectangular to
coax (WG5) transition, allowing for the interface with the test equipment. The
circular to rectangular transition was manufactured at Calfer and the WG5
transition, at Phase2 Microwave. The rectangular-to-coax transition has internal dimensions of 97.79 × 195.58 mm and the circular-to-rectangular transition
consists of three sections. The WG5 to coax drawings and the circular-torectangular transition can be seen in Figure 5
Input and return loss measurements can easily be affected by errors in the
VNA calibration. In particular, any losses in the connecting cables and waveguide transitions connected to the horns need to be measured and calibrated
out to give just the horn properties. Initial measurements used the standard
VNA calibration components at the end of the SMA cables, and the loss of
the waveguide components (except for the horn) has to be subtracted from the
measurements later on. The insertion loss of the WG5 transition was measured
with the VNA, and we obtained losses between −0.025 and −0.12 dB (mean of
−0.075 dB) in the BINGO band. The measured rectangular-to-circular insertion loss figures were between −0.06 and −0.15 dB (mean of −0.1 dB). Once
this was done the actual horn return and insertion loss were measured.
However, the standard cable calibration procedure was not accurate enough
for the tests, so we looked for a new procedure, aiming for higher accuracy. A
waveguide calibration, including the WG5 transitions in the calibration process, was tested using a 1/8 wavelength waveguide offset and a rectangular

blanking plate (“short”) manufactured specifically for this new process. This
method was preferred for all future measurements of the waveguide components.

4.2 Horn prototype
Initial measurements of the insertion loss of the horn were made at Calfer
(Figure 6, left panel) to check that the horn was functioning correctly before
acceptance. These were followed by more intensive tests during 2018 of both
the insertion and return loss at INPE, using cable calibration. The final set
of measurements presented here were taken in February and March 2019 and
used waveguide calibration.
The final insertion loss measurements of the horn including the circularto-rectangular transition are shown in Figure 7. It will be noted that there
are regular spikes in the insertion loss, which arise from standing waves in the
formed “cavity” between the reflecting plate and some part of the horn throat.
These spikes will not be present in normal operation without the reflecting
plate and can be ignored. If we do this the measured insertion loss within the
BINGO band is −0.14 dB, with a standard deviation of 0.05 dB. We estimate
the uncertainty on this measurement due to VNA calibration to be around
0.05 dB. This loss would result in an increase in system temperature of around
10 K. Subsequently, we have identified areas in which small modifications in
the fabrication process can be made to try and reduce this loss, and these will
be tested with a second prototype.

4.3 Beam measurements
The Laboratory of Integration and Tests (LIT) is a Brazilian facility to integrate and test satellites up to the 2-ton class, located at INPE, in São José dos
Campos, Brazil. It has a far-field antenna test range that was used to measure
the horn beam pattern. Measurements of the prototype BINGO horn were
conducted during 22–25 May 2018. Figure 8 depicts the procedure of inserting the prototype horn inside the antenna test range and its final positioning
facing the transmitter before the beginning of the tests.
The test facility consists of a 9 m wide × 9 m tall × 10 m deep chamber,
fully covered inside with absorbing cones and facing the transmitting antenna
through a 9 m × 9 m open window. The transmitter is mounted on a tower
located 80 m away from the chamber and can produce both horizontal and
vertical linearly polarized signals, rotating the transmitting feed by 90◦ . The
horn was mounted on top of a turntable with its aperture located about 1.5 m
ahead of the rotation axis. This system is capable of continuous 360◦ horizontal
rotation, clockwise and counterclockwise, and the horn response to the signal
emitted by the far-field transmitted is continuously measured until a 360◦
horizontal rotation is completed. H polarization measurements were taken with
the transition attached to the throat and its longest length in the vertical
position. V polarization measurements were taked with the transition rotated
by 90◦ in respect to the former position. Chamber temperature and humidity

were not controlled nor taken into account during the data acquisition process,
but should not have a significant effect on these measurements.
The radiation pattern measurements were performed using linear polarization transmitters on the tower; the signal was generated by a ANRITSU
MG3649B equipment. The horn was connected to a MI-1797 receiver (fabricated by Scientific Devices Australia Pty. Ltd. - SDA) via the same circularto-rectangular and rectangular-to-coax (WG5) transitions as described in the
previous subsection. The acquisition software is also from SDA. We made 17
measurements at 25 MHz intervals from 900 to 1300 MHz (900, 925, 950, ...,
1250, 1275, 1300 MHz), and each frequency was measured in both vertical
and horizontal direct polarization, with simultaneous cross-polarization measurements in 7 of them (900, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1300 MHz). The
directivity was calculated by numerically integrating the irradiation diagrams.
Table 2 shows a sample of the data for the frequencies where E-plane (direct) and H-plane (cross) measurements were made simultaneously. Directivity
and FWHM are essentially the same for both polarizations in each frequency,
indicating that the beams should be nearly circular across the frequency band.
The front to back relation refers to the ratio between signal measured at 0◦ and
signal measured at ±180◦ and indicates the level of rejection of the horn beam
pattern. There is a spread in the values for vertical (about 15 dB) and horizontal polarization (25 dB). Nevertheless, the worst case (for horizontal polarization at 900 MHz) is 46 dB, and, inside the nominal band (980–1260 MHz),
the worst response is 48.39 dB, also for horizontal polarization.
Beam patterns are shown in Figure 9, with the performance along a full
azimuth scan in the left-hand panel, and a zoom over 0–45◦ in the righthand panel. The beamsize of the horn alone depends on frequency, while the
reduction in illuminated mirror surface will compensate for this to first order
so that the telescope beam on the sky will be relatively frequency-independent.
As such, we scale the beam width by the frequency in GHz to normalise the
beam width to 1 GHz.
Minimum rejection refers to the cross-polarization (leakage from V to H
during H measurements and vice-versa) contamination and was measured at
900, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 and 1300 MHz. Transmitter in the antenna
was rotated by 90◦ to verify cross-polarization sensitivity. The worst case is a
minimum rejection of 19.7 dB at 1150 MHz in the vertical polarization.
Simulations of the cross-polarization performance for this specific design
indeed shows a much better performance for cross-pol rejection. However, we
have no reason to believe in a poor horn design, due to the simulations results,
or in a poor ring alignment, since FWHM varies, on average, by 1.1% between
975 1300 MHz, meaning it is essentially the same for both H and V polarizations at any frequency (and scales similarly across the frequency band). On
the other hand, a few recently raised issues regarding the test range environment may have caused this behavior. There will be a new series of tests for the
second prototype horn and cross-polarization rejection will then be carefully
addressed.

On average, the response of the first sidelobe is 25 dB lower than the main
lobe, in agreement with the simulations. These levels of beam sidelobes are
similar to those obtained by the VLA L-band horn. The simulated beam pattern in Figure 1 is better than the measured one by about 5 dB in the second
sidelobe, which may be due to the horn support structure, and as such we
are investigating ways in which we can improve the measurements and manufacturing process in order to get the horn performance to better match the
theoretical value.

5 Polariser
As described in Section 2, it is desirable to make observations using circular
polarisation. In this section we describe the transition required to connect
the circular horn throat to the square input to the polariser, followed by a
description of the polarization design itself. Finally, laboratory measurements
of the performance are presented.

5.1 The circular to square transition
The termination of the horn is circular but the input to the polariser is a square
waveguide so a transition is required. Initially a transformer that gradually
merged the circular to square profile was evaluated but in the end, a two-step
design was found to give superior performance with a shorter overall length.
The total length was under 200 mm. The design and the predicted return loss
are shown in Figure 10. The return loss should be better than 30 dB across
the band of interest.

5.2 Polariser design
The polariser was designed in the UK by Phase 2 Microwave and manufactured
in Brazil by Metalcard. The polariser needs to be able to take the two incoming
hands of circular polarisation from the horn and convert them to linear with
high isolation between them. The output should be in a rectangular guide
because the next component in the receiver chain is a waveguide magic-tee.
While specialised waveguide sizes could be used it was decided to make the
output in waveguide WG5 (WR770) to simplify connection to the magic-tee
and to allow for the use of standard test equipment. Figure 11 shows the 3D
rendering of the design.
The relative bandwidth is moderately high at 25% and the use of a stepped
septum polariser is the normal solution for this sort of bandwidth. Since a
circular guide version has a narrower bandwidth than the square guide version,
the latter was adopted. Also, designs in the square guide were already available
at higher frequencies so these could be adapted. The disadvantage is that a

circular to square transformer is required as discussed above. The idea of a
septum polariser design was originated by [23].
A septum with four steps was chosen after a five-step septum was investigated but showed no real benefit in performance. Analytical design is not
available so software optimisation of the septum step lengths was required.
The design consists of four parts. The septum polariser is followed by a “joggle” to separate the output waveguides and two transitions from the special
waveguide size to standard WG5. Preceding the septum is a phasing section.
The dimension of the square guide was chosen to be 160 mm. For this, the
transverse electromagnetic propagation mode (TE01) cutoff is 937 MHz, i.e.,
not too near the 980 MHz at the bottom of the BINGO band. The next modes
are the TE11/TM11 modes at 1325 MHz. The mode matching Microwave Wizard (from Mician) software was used to optimise the design. The predicted
return loss over the band is better than 20 dB with 25 dB isolation between
orthogonal polarisations. Figure 11 shows the manufactured hardware.
To form a pure circular wave we need two linear waves at exactly 90 degrees
to each other. It was found that this was very difficult to achieve at the top
end of the band and in the end, three pairs of irises, parallel to the septum

detail. Right: Rear view of the transitions, polariser, with the shorting plate at the end of

improved by 5 degrees to be within −6 to +2.5 degrees across the required
band.

5.3 Perfomance testing
Measurement of a polariser is difficult and several setups are typically needed
to capture all the information. We did not have the benefit of having any
waveguide loads, nor two polarisers to perform back to back measurements,
which further restricted our options. We decided to proceed as follows: the
square polariser port was shorted using an aluminium plate and the polariser
was measured between the two rectangular ports. Power entering at one port
should be totally reflected at the shorting plate into the other port. The two
way loss and both return losses were measured. The results were then compared
with theory and a very close match was found for return loss. Measurements
for both return losses were almost identical and only one trace is shown. There
was a greater deviation for insertion loss, which was higher than desired at
−0.12 dB on average across the band (Figure 12). We have identified places
where fixing the different parts of the polariser together can be improved and
it is expected that by doing this we will be able to reduce the loss in subsequent
examples.
The combined insertion loss of the horn and polariser were also measured,
and are shown in Figure 12. The average insertion loss across the band is
−0.35 dB, with a standard deviation of |0.3| dB, without removing the spikes
caused by standing waves. The return loss is 24 dB on average across the band.

6 Summary
The return and insertion losses for horn, polariser and transitions call tests
are summarised in Table 3. The beam response is summarized in Table 2.
Altogether, the performance of this horn plus front-end prototype should add
approximately 20 K to the BINGO noise budget.
In addition, within the frequency range 980–1260 MHz (nominal band) the
horn’s directivity varies from 22.7 dB to 25.3 dB. The difference in FWHM for
both polarizations is at most 0.31◦ at 1 GHz, remaining under 0.25◦ degrees
everywhere else. The front to back lobe rejection changes within the nominal
band. The worst measurements are 48.39 dB at 1 GHz (horizontal polarization)
and 51.92 dB at 975 MHz (vertical polarization). The minimum rejection for
both polarizations is around 19.8 dB at 1150 MHz and is very likely due to a
specific contamination during the measurements. This point will be verified
when testing the first inspection unit. Finally, the first sidelobes are located
within 20◦ –30◦ and have amplitudes −25 dB lower than the main lobe.

7 Conclusions and future work
We have successfully built a large prototype corrugated horn for the BINGO
telescope, which achieves low insertion loss (around 0.15 dB), good return loss
(larger than 20 dB within the band), and with a clean beam with low sidelobes
lower than 27 dB within the band). The prototype horn will undergo further
testing, including use for early astronomical observations at the BINGO site.
A second prototype is under construction, with improvements made to the
construction process, such as the addition of a fourth roller to the bending
machine, modified aluminium profiles with reinforced corners to reduce tearing during bending. These fabrication adjustments are intended to reduce the
amount of human intervention involved in the horn production, which is a
major contribution to the final cost when we proceed to the production of
the full batch of around 50 horns in the near future. In addition to the mechanical improvements, refinements in the construction of both the horn and
polariser are being investigated. Our expectation is that these refinements will
improve the electromagnetic performance of the production units, decreasing
their contribution to the system temperature.
