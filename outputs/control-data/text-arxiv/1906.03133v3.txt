Abstract
We investigate the approximation formulas that were proposed by Tanaka & Sugihara
(2018), in weighted Hardy spaces, which are analytic function spaces with certain asymptotic
decay. Under the criterion of minimum worst error of n-point approximation formulas, we
demonstrate that the formulas are nearly optimal. We also obtain the upper bounds of the
approximation errors that coincide with the existing heuristic bounds in asymptotic order by
duality theorem for the minimization problem of potential energy.

Introduction

1.1

Objective

Tanaka & Sugihara (2018) proposed an algorithm to design accurate interpolation formulas (taking
over the arguments of Tanaka et al. (2017)), in function spaces called weighted Hardy spaces.
Although their methods have shown superiority to the well-used sinc approximation formulas, their
studies only provided heuristic analyses on those formulas without any theoretical guarantees. In
this study, we mathematically
(1) prove the near optimality of the formulas
(2) provide an upper bound of the optimal error and show that the bound coincides in asymptotic
order with the heuristic bound derived by Tanaka et al. (2017).

1.2

Background

In this study, we treat the weighted Hardy spaces H∞ (Dd , w) defined later in (2.1). The elements
of this space are (complex) regular functions whose domain is Dd = {z ∈ C | | Im z| < d}
(d > 0) and have an asymptotic decay with Re z → ±∞ dominated by a weight function w with
certain properties. The spaces H∞ (Dd , w) appear in literature as spaces of variable-transformed
functions (Stenger 1993, Stenger 2011, Sugihara 2003, Tanaka et al. 2009). For example, the double
exponential (DE) transform, which is well-used in numerical analysis (Takahasi & Mori 1974), has
the form


π
sinh(x)

and shows a double-exponential decay. Also, TANH transform g(tanh(x/2)) is commonly used
(Schwartz 1969, Haber 1977). These variable transformations are employed for the accurate approximation of functions by yielding functions with rapid decay on Dd , which enables us to neglect
the values of the functions for large |x|. This motivates us to analyze the approximation possibility
over weighted Hardy spaces with general weight functions w.

for several weight functions w, attempts to construct an optimal formula for general weight functions was started in the literature. For this purpose, Tanaka et al. (2017) employed potential theoretical arguments to generate sampling points for the approximation of functions. Furthermore,
Tanaka & Sugihara (2018) simplified the arguments and proposed accurate formulas outperforming
the sinc methods. For more details, see the introductory section of Tanaka & Sugihara (2018).
Because the optimality of the formulas was not mathematically justified, we analyzed it to
contribute to the literature in two ways, (1) and (2) listed in Section 1.1.

Basic ideas

In Tanaka & Sugihara (2018), the following evaluation of minimum error (over H∞ (Dd , w)) was
shown (Tanaka & Sugihara 2018, Theorem 3.4, 3.5):

defined later in Proposition 2.2. FK,Q
(n) is the discrete counterpart of FK,Q
(n). Here, it should
be noted that the algorithm to achieve the error in the right-hand side of (1.1) was proposed
by Tanaka & Sugihara (2018) concretely. This implies that the algorithm is assured of “near

D
optimality” ((1) in Section 1.1) if we prove FK,Q
(n)/n and FK,Q
(n)/(n − 1) are close. Because
C
D
FK,Q (n) and FK,Q (n) were obtained from the optimal solutions of an optimization problem and
its discrete counterpart, respectively, we created a feasible solution for the former problem using
the optimal solution of the latter, to obtain an evaluation like

(n) . 2FK,Q

(n) . FK,Q
FK,Q
C
To approach (2) in Section 1.1, we must find some lower bound of FK,Q
(n). It should be noted
C
that the optimal value of (P) is a lower bound for 2FK,Q (n) (for more details, see Proposition
2.2). Because it is not easy to calculate the optimal value of (P) exactly, its lower bound needs
to be determined. However, because (P) is a minimization problem, any concrete feasible solution
does not help us. Therefore, we prove that (P) can be regarded as an infinite-dimensional convex
quadratic programming, as K is positive semi-definite in measure (Definition 4.1), and take the
dual problem (Dorn 1960, Luenberger 1997). We also show that the dual problem

subject to

ν is aZsigned Borel measure
s − K(· − y) dν(y) ≤ Q
R

satisfies the weak and strong duality (Theorem 4.6), i.e., the optimal value of (D) coincides with
that of (P). By this, we can obtain a lower bound for the optimal value of (P), taking concrete ν
and s. The practical advantage of taking (D) is that ν can be a signed measure (though we indeed
deal with a little wider class in Section 4), which means that we can define ν as some Fourier
transform of the symmetric function, without confirming the non-negativity. This solves one of
the improper points of the evaluation in Tanaka et al. (2017).
C
Following this primal-dual argument, we explicitly obtain lower bounds of FK,Q
(n) and demonstrate that the rates of lower bounds coincide with those of heuristic bounds in Tanaka et al. (2017).

Organization of this paper

In Section 2, we present a mathematical overview of the existing studies and describe our main
results as mathematical statements. Section 3 describes the proof of the first result, i.e., (1) in
Section 1.1. Section 4 contains general arguments, which introduce the concept of “positive semidefinite in measure”. Then, we show that the problem under our interest is a special case of that
concept and derive the duality theorem. The evaluations for the second result, described as (2)
in Section 1.1, are given in Section 5. We also compare the bounds with those in Tanaka et al.
(2017). Finally, we describe the concluding remarks in Section 6.

2.1

Mathematical preliminaries and main results
General settings

We first give some definitions and formulate the problem mathematically. Let d > 0 and define
the strip region Dd := {z ∈ C | | Im z| < d}. Throughout this paper, a weight function w : Dd → C
is supposed to satisfy the following conditions:
(1) w is analytic and does not vanish over the domain Dd and takes values in (0, 1] on R;
R∞
Rd
(2) w satisfies limx→±∞ −d |w(x+iy)| dy = 0 and limyրd −∞ (|w(x+iy)|+|w(x−iy)|) dx < ∞;
(3) log w is strictly concave on R.

For a weight function with the above conditions, we define a weighted Hardy space on Dd by


H∞ (Dd , w) := f : Dd → C f is analytic on Dd , sup

We define
kf k := sup

z∈Dd

f (z)

for f ∈ H (Dd , w), and the expression kf k < ∞ shall also imply f ∈ H∞ in the following.
For an approximation formula over H∞ (Dd , w), an evaluation criterion needs to be defined.
Based on Sugihara (2003) and Tanaka & Sugihara (2018), we adopt the minimum worst-case error

(2.2)

which is known to characterize the value Enmin (H∞ (Dd , w)) as follows.
Proposition 2.1. (Sugihara 2003, Tanaka & Sugihara 2018) We have an upper bound of the error
of (2.2) as
sup
|f (x) − Ln [a; f ](x)| ≤ sup |Bn (x; a, Dd )w(x)|
x∈R

kf k≤1, x∈R

{aj }nj=1

for any fixed sequence a =
⊂ R (of distinct points). Moreover, by taking infimum of the
above expression over all n-sequences, it holds that
Enmin (H∞ (Dd , w)) = inf

sup

aj ∈R kf k≤1, x∈R

|f (x) − Ln [a; f ](x)| = inf sup |Bn (x; a, Dd )w(x)|.
aj ∈R x∈R

By this assertion, it is enough to consider interpolation formulas of the form (2.2). Additionally,
this motivates us to analyze the value supx∈R |Bn (x; a, Dd )w(x)|, which is simpler than the worstcase error of (2.2). In Tanaka et al. (2017) and Tanaka & Sugihara (2018),

Because each feasible solution of (DC) can be interpreted as a combination of δ-measures being a
feasible solution of (CT),
(the optimal value of (DC)) ≤ (the optimal value of (CT))

(2.3)

Potential theoretical arguments (Saff & Totik 1997, Levin & Lubinsky 2001, Tanaka & Sugihara
2018) lead to the following proposition.

(2018).

Duality theorem for convex programming of measures

The following definition is a variant of the existing definitions of positive definite kernel (Stewart
1976, Jaming et al. 2009, Sriperumbudur et al. 2010).

Definition 4.1. Let X be a topological space. A non-negative measurable function k : X × X →
R≥0 ∪ {∞} is called positive semi-definite in measure if it satisfies

for an arbitrary signed Borel measure µ on X with |µ| being σ-finite, where |µ| denotes the total
variation of µ. This is the generalization of the ordinary positive semi-definiteness. Notice that
this non-negativity holds for a wider class of “measure” as follows.

we define

then this integral is well-defined and non-negative, and can also be seen as the generalization of
quadratic forms for ordinary signed measures. We formally write ν = ν+ − ν− in such a situation,
and call it also the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of ν. We also define |ν| := ν+ + ν− .
Remark 4.4. We here note the difference between signed measures and the elements of Sk . If
µ is a signed measure with the decomposition µ = µ+ − µ− , at least one of µ+ and µ− should
be finite. However, for µ = (µ+ , µ− ) ∈ Sk , this does not necessarily holds. Indeed, in the case
X = R, consider a function f such that k(x, y)f (x)f (y) ∈ L1 (R × R). In such a case, for f+ :=
max(f, 0)Rand f− = − min(f, 0), (f+ (x) dx, f− (x) dx) ∈ Sk (here g(x) dx represents the measure
µg (A) = A g(x) dx) holds, but if both f+ and f− are not contained in L1 (R), we cannot regard
this as a signed measure. Such a counter example can easily be constructed.
The other direction
RR
((singed measures) ⊂ Sk ) is also not generally true as we assume
k(x, y) dµ+ (x) dµ+ (y) < ∞
for any µ ∈ Sk .
Lemma 4.5. Let K : R → R≥0 ∪ {+∞} be an even function. If K ∈ L1 (R) and K is convex on
[0, ∞), and satisfies limxց0 K(x) = K(0), then K(x − y) is positive semi-definite in measure.
Proof. Because K is integrable and convex, K is continuous over (0, ∞) and limx→∞ K(x) = 0
holds true. If K(0) < ∞, K becomes continuous and this type of function is called Pólya-type.
Pólya-type functions are known to be a characteristic function of a positive bounded Borel measure,
i.e., there exists a positive bounded measure α on R such that

This condition means that (µ+ , µ− ) ∈ SK , though SK has not yet been defined because we have
not shown that K is positive semi-definite in measure. Our goal is to show that the given (µ+ , µ− )
satisfies Ineq. (4.1) (note that unless the above integrability is satisfied, then Ineq. (4.1) with
(µ, ν) = (µ+ , µ− ) is trivial). Then, |µ| := µ+ + µ− is also a σ-finite measure, so we can take
a sequence of increasing Borel sets A1 ⊂ A2 ⊂ · · · → R satisfying |µ|(Ak ) < ∞ for all k. Let
µk+ := µ+ (Ak ∩ ·), µk− := µ− (Ak ∩ ·). For each k, by Fubini’s theorem and (4.2), we have

Then, by K ∈ L1 (R), K is bounded everywhere by ε−1 kKkL1 . Moreover, Kε is still convex, such

It should be noted here that we have not justified (D) as a formal (topologically) dual problem.
There are arguments limited to the optimization of Radon measure over compact space (Ohtsuka
1966a, Ohtsuka 1966b, Wu 2001). While they are on quadratic programming problems, there
exist more general theories on duality, such as Isii (1964), von Neumann’s minimax theorem (von
Neumann 1928, Sion 1958) and Fenchel-Rockafellar duality theorem (Rockafellar 1966, Villani
2003). However, as it is essential that our duality can treat infinite measure ν with unbounded
support (we indeed later use such a measure as a dual feasible solution), it is difficult to just apply
10

existing studies and check all the conditions for (D) to be a topologically dual problem. Therefore,
we here do not go deeper in this aspect, but just prove the assertion of Theorem 4.6. This assertion
is sufficient to derive a lower bound of the optimal value of (P), which is our objective.
In the following, we demonstrate that the weak duality and strong duality are still valid in this
infinite-dimensional primal-dual pair. It should be noted that s = 0, ν ≡ 0 is a trivial feasible
solution of (D) such that there exists an optimal value of (D).
Theorem 4.6. The optimal value of (D) is equal to the optimal value of (P).
Proof. First, we present the weak duality. Let µ and (ν, s) be feasible solutions of (P) and
R(D),
R respectively, and ν = ν+ − ν− be the Hahn-Jordan decomposition. If we write hα, βiK :=
R R K(x − y) dα(x) dβ(y) for measures α and β,
hν, νiK = hν+ , ν+ iK + hν− , ν− iK − 2hν+ , ν− iK

holds true. Because hµ, µiK , hν+ , ν+ iK , hν− , ν− iK < ∞, we have hµ, ν+ iK , hµ, ν− iK , hν+ , ν− iK <
∞ by K’s positive semi-definiteness in measure. Therefore, we have

by the positive semi-definiteness in measure. This indicates the weak duality.
To prove the strong duality, we construct the optimal solution of (D) using that of (P). By

Lower bounds of FK,Q

We can now give a lower bound of FK,Q

Along with this, f is L2 -integrable by Theorem 4.4 in Tanaka et al. (2017). Here, the Fourier
transform of a function g ∈ L1 (R) ∩ L2 (R) is defined by
Z
g(x)e−iωx dx
F [g](ω) :=
R

and for the whole space L2 (R), F [·] is defined as the continuous extension of F [·]|L1 ∩L2 . Because
Q(x) is even by the assumption, f is an inverse Fourier transform of an even real function, so that
f itself is an even real function. Then, the formula (p.43, 7.112 in Oberhettinger 1990)

where K ∈ L1 (R) ∩ L2 (R) (see Appendix A) and f ∈ L2 (R) are used for the justification of the
first equality. The integrability of K(x − ·)f (·) comes from K, f ∈ L2 (R) and by Minkowski’s

Examples of convergence rates for several Q(x)’s

Although the asymptotic rates given in Tanaka et al. (2017, Section 4.3) are derived through
mathematically informal arguments, we here demonstrate that those rates roughly coincide with
the bound in Theorem 2.4.
Example 5.1. (The case w is a single exponential) Consider the case
w(x) = exp (−(β|x|)ρ ) ,

Q(x) = (β|x|)ρ ,

for β > 0 and ρ ≥ 1. In this case, for a sufficiently large α (satisfying α ≥ ρ), we have

Conclusion

In this study, we analyzed the approximation method proposed by Tanaka & Sugihara (2018) over
weighted Hardy spaces H∞ (Dd , w). We provided (1) proof of the fact that the approximation
formulas are nearly optimal from the viewpoint of minimum worst-case error Enmin (H∞ (Dd , w));
and (2) upper bounds of Enmin (H∞ (Dd )) to evaluate the convergence rates of approximation errors
with n → ∞. To obtain (2), we introduced the concept “positive semi-definite in measure” and
C
by using this, provided a lower bound for FK,Q
(n). We also compared the given bounds with
those mentioned in the study by Tanaka et al. (2017), and demonstrated that they have the same
convergence rate with n → ∞.
