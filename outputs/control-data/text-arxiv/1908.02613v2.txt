Higher symmetries can emerge at low energies in a topologically ordered state with no symmetry,
when some topological excitations have very high energy scales while other topological excitations
have low energies. The low energy properties of topological orders in this limit, with the emergent
higher symmetries, may be described by higher symmetry protected topological order. This motivates us, as a simplest example, to study a lattice model of Zn -1-symmetry protected topological
(1-SPT) states in 3+1D for even n. We write down an exactly solvable lattice model and study its
boundary transformation. On the boundary, we show the existence of anyons with non-trivial selfstatistics. For the n = 2 case, where the bulk classification is given by an integer m mod 4, we show
that the boundary can be gapped with double semion topological order for m = 1 and toric code
for m = 2. The bulk ground state wavefunction amplitude is given in terms of the linking numbers
of loops in the dual lattice. Our construction can be generalized to arbitrary 1-SPT protected by
finite unitary symmetry.

INTRODUCTION

In the last few decades, there has been rapid progress
in understanding “topological phases” of matter, which
despite sharing the same symmetry, must undergo a
phase transition to reach one phase from another. Some
famous examples are the topological ordered states
with no symmetry1,2 which have degenerate ground
states on topological non-trivial closed manifolds, as well

2
as symmetry protected topological (SPT) states with
symmetry3–6 , which does not have topological order and
have a unique gapped ground state in closed manifolds.
A 3+1D topological order can have point-like and
string-like topological excitations7–9 . For example, a
3+1D topological order described by Zn gauge theory
has Zn charges (the point-like topological excitations)
and Zn flux-lines (the string-like topological excitations).
If the Zn charges have very large energy gap, then the
theory for low energy Zn flux-lines will have an emergent
higher symmetry – a Zn 1-symmetry10 . In other words
the low energy effective Hamiltonian is invariant under
the symmetry transformations that act on all closed 2dimension subspaces of the 3-dimensional space. Thus to
understand the topological orders in such a limit, we can
study Hamiltonians with a 1-symmetry. This motivates
us to study 1-symmetry in this paper, such as the lattice
Hamiltonian that realize 1-symmetry and the associated
symmetry protected topological order, as well as their
boundaries.
We will refer the transformations that act closed 2dimension subspaces as the transformation membrane. If
the 3d space have a boundary, the transformation membrane may intersect with the boundary. Such an intersection will be called transformation string.

A.

Statement of results

In this paper, we will study lattice systems with higher
symmetries11–24 . Like the usual symmetry (0-symmetry)
that can have SPT order3–6 , higher symmetry can also
have higher SPT order10,19,21 . In this paper, we will concentrate on 3+1D systems with Zn 1-symmetry and the
associated associated 3+1D Zn 1-SPT states. Those systems can appear as low energy effective theories for 3+1D
Zn topological order where the Zn charges have a large
energy gap.
The 3+1D Zn 1-SPT states are known to have a Z2n
classification25,26 , labeled by m ∈ Z2n . We study them
in the Hamiltonian formalism and write down an exactly
solvable bulk Hamiltonian, which has a compact expression when m is even.
The boundary of our system can also have the
Zn 1-symmetry, but such a Zn 1-symmetry is
anomalous19,21,27 .
We find that on the boundary,
the transformation strings can carry non-trivial selfstatistics, as a reflection of the anomaly. This predicts
the gapped boundary of the 1-SPT to have emergent
anyons. We also find that it is possible for its surface
state to be a gapped topological ordered state. The topological ordered boundary state has degenerate ground
states if the surface manifold has non-zero genus. These
degenerate states exhibit the spontaneous breaking of 1symmetry. We also give a geometric interpretation of the
ground state wave function, by writing the wave function
amplitude in terms of the linking numbers of loops in the
dual lattice.

Notations and conventions

In some part of this paper, we will use the Lagrangian
formalism to describe quantum lattice systems. This allows us to use extensively the notion of cochain, cocycle,
and coboundary, as well as their higher cup product ^
k

and Steenrod square Sqk , to construct exactly solvable
Lagrangian that realize topological orders and (higher)
SPT orders. The reason to use modern mathematical formalisms is that they allow us to see the features of topological order and (higher) SPT order easily and quickly.
But the modern mathematical formalisms are not
widely used in condensed matter theory. So we provide a
brief introduction in Appendix A. Also, the Lagrangian
formalism does not give us a lattice Hamiltonian explicitly. So in this paper, we present a systematic and direct
way to obtain a lattice Hamiltonian from the those exactly solvable Lagrangian.
We will abbreviate the cup product of cochains a ^ b
n
as ab by dropping ^. We will use = to mean equal up
d
to a multiple of n, and use = to mean equal up to df
(i.e. up to a coboundary). We will use hl, mi to denote
the greatest common divisor of l and m (h0, mi ≡ m).
We will also use bxe to denote the integer that is closest
to x. (If two integers have the same distance to x, we
will choose the smaller one, eg . b 12 e = 0.)
In this paper, we will deal with Zn -value quantities.
We will denote them as:
a
aZn := a − nb e,
n
n
so the value of aZn has a range from −b n−1
2 e to b 2 e. We
will sometimes lift a Zn -value to Z-value, and when we
do so we omit the superscript, eg . aZn → aZ = a, so we
can make sense of expressions like aZn +a0Z , which means
aZ + a0Z . Since (a + nuZ )Zn = aZn , whenever we lift a
Zn -value to Z-value we need to take care whether the
final result is independent of choice of lifting, i.e. choice
of uZ .
We will also use D to denote spacetime dimensions and
d to denote space dimensions.

Overview of paper

The structure of the paper and a road map for reading
is presented as follows.
In section II, we review some background information connecting the cohomology models we studied to
the standard many-body theory. We explained what are
those cohomology models, and some simple examples of
those model that realize simple topological orders and
(higher) SPT orders.
In section III we present an intuitive, informal argument for one of our major results, the self and mutual
statistics of boundary transformation strings, without
using the mathematical machinery of cochains and cocycles. The formal argument begins from section IV, where

3
we cite from the literature that the Zn -1 SPT has Z2n
classification from cohomology, such that each phase is
labeled by m ∈ Z2n . We write down the exactly solvable Lagrangian, the expression for ω4 in (11). We also
show that it changes by a boundary term under gauge
d
transformation via (16)=(20),
ω4 [B̂ Zn + daZn ] = ω4 [B̂ Zn ] + dφ3 [B̂ Zn , aZn ]
for some function φ3 . This implies ω4 [B̂ Zn + daZn ] and
ω4 [B̂ Zn ] gives the same answer when summed over a
closed manifold, which is expected from gauge invariance
(1).
In section V we specialize to the case B̂ Zn = 0 and
give the explicit form of φ3 [aZn ] in (28). In Appendix
B and C,R we argue that on a closed spatial manifold
Zn
M3 , e2π i M3 φ3 [a ] is the amplitude of the ground state
wavefunction. We achieve this by examining the timeevolution operator e−T Ĥ∞ whose matrix elements are
given in (B3). We show that it is a projection operator(hence an infinite gap) and has trace 1(hence a unique
ground state). We further argue this transfer matrix can
be decomposed into local commuting projection operators Pij (B6). We then build our exactly solvable Hamiltonian with a finite gap by summing over the −Pij ’s. We
then verify that the ground state wavefunction is indeed
given in terms of φ3 [aZn ].
To write down the exactly solvable Hamiltonian, we
consider a particular triangulation of M3 , given in Appendix D. We compute the explicit form for Pij for the
even m case in Appendix F and the odd m case in Appendix G. Unfortunately, we are unable to further simplify the expression in the odd m case. The results are
summarized and presented in section V.
In section VI we consider the case when M3 has a
boundary. We introduced the notion of a “boundary
state”(36), which is obtained by fixing the degrees of
freedom on the boundary and relaxing the bulk degrees
of freedom to their ground state. As a result, the originally non-anomalous 1-symmetry transformation from
the bulk now transform
the boundary states with an
R
Zn
Zn
additional phase e2π i ∂M3 φ2 [a ,h ] . This phase captures the ’t Hooft anomaly of 1-symmetry in the boundary. Any boundary Hamiltonian must be symmetric under this anomalous 1-symmetry in order to cancel the ’t
Hooft anomaly. We show that φ2 [aZn ] is related to the
ground state wavefunction φ3 [aZn ] by (40):
φ3 [(a + dh)Zn ] − φ3 [aZn ] = −dφ2 [aZn , hZn ]
which states that under the 1-symmetry, the ground state
wavefunction changes by a boundary term. We write
down the explicit form of φ2 [aZn , hZn ] in (41). Using
this explicit form, we are able to compute the self(49)
and mutual(51) statistics of the transformation strings.
Details of the computation are given in H. The boundary
transformation strings may be interpreted as hopping operators for anyons residing on the end of the strings. This

predicts the emergence of such anyon on the boundary
theory and is the main result of the paper.
In section VII we test our prediction by writing down
some gapped boundary Hamiltonians which obeys the
anomalous 1-symmetry. We specialize to n = 2 and check
the cases m = 2 and m = 1. We show that the gapped
boundary is identical to the toric code model (for m = 2)
and the double semion model (for m = 1). We verify in
both cases that the boundary indeed contains an anyon
with the predicted statistics. Details of the computation
for the boundary Hamiltonian are given in I.
In section VIII we return to examine the ground state
wavefunction. We present the geometric interpretation
of the bulk wave function amplitude as a knot invariant
(linking number) of loops dual to daZn .
In section IX we extend our study to the case with a
non-zero background gauge field. In the even m case, we
find a line charge with charge −m is attached to the dual
line of the background gauge field. Details are presented
in Appendix B 2 and C 2.
In Appendix J we go deeper into the origin of the connections between ω4 , φ3 , φ2 , and show that they are
members of a series of algebraic objects φk which encodes the same cocycle ω4 at sub-manifolds of dimension
k.
In Appendix K we present the result of generalizing
the computation of boundary string statistics to other
unitary groups.

II. A BRIEF REVIEW OF TOPOLOGICAL
ORDER, SPT STATES, AND HIGHER SPT
STATES

A large class of topological orders can be realized by
exactly solvable Lagrangian model. To write down the
Lagrangian model, we first triangulate the spacetime to
obtain a spacetime lattice MD , whose vertices are labeled by i, j, · · · . The physical degrees of freedom Bij live
on the link ij, and takes value in a group G, i.e. Bij ∈ G.
In this paper, we always assume G to be Abelian. The
collection of those values Bij give us a field B on spacetime, which, in this case, is also called a gauge configuration. A quantum system in Lagrangian formulation
is described by a path integral with an action amplitude. For our model, the action amplitude assigns a
top
D
U (1) phase e2π i S [M ,B] to a gauge configuration B
on a D-dimensional spacetime lattice MD . The gauge
field B satisfies the “flatness condition” dB = 0 which is
enforced by an energy penalty term U | dB|2 in U → ∞
limit. The model is exactly solvable if the U (1) phase
is a topological invariant, meaning it remains unchanged
under “deformations” of the lattice MD (change of triangulation), and is also invariant under gauge transformations B → B + da, i.e. (in this paper we will assume
the underlying group G is an Abelian finite group.)

Up to a volume term,7,28 the partition function Z(MD ) is
a topological invariant of manifold MD , that characterize
a topological order. When S top [MD , B] = 0, our model
realize a G topological order described by a G-gauge theory. When S top [MD , B] 6= 0, our exactly solvable model
realizes a topological order described by a twisted Ggauge theory, which is also known as Dijkgraaf-Witten
model29 .

The action amplitude e2π i S [M ,B] of the exactly solvable model can also be viewed as an SPT
invariant30–32 that characterizes an SPT order protected
by symmetry G, if we view B as the background gauge
field B̂ that describes the symmetry twist on the spacetime MD . Such a relation is also referred to as “ungauging” a topological order, which results in a SPT order.

The SPT invariant e2π i S [M ,B̂] characterizes a large
class of SPT orders.
To realize the SPT states characterized by the above
SPT invariant, we write B = B̂ + da, fix a background
gauge configuration B̂, and treat the different gauge
transformations a as distinct physical fields. The partition function, after summing all the degrees of freedom
a, reproduces the SPT invariant, up to a space-time volume term:7,28

Note that the action is invariant under the symmetry
a → a + α for α satisfying dα = 0. An SPT is trivtop
D
ial if e2π i S [M ,B̂] = 1 for all closed manifolds and
background gauge fields B̂. SPTs also form an Abelian
group under stacking. The topological action S top for
the stacked SPT is the sum of the topological actions of
its layers. The trivial SPT is the identity element under
stacking and describes a direct product state.
“Group cohomology construction”5 is one way to write
down S top [MD , B̂]. In this construction, we assume that
S top [MD , B̂] can be written as a sum over all the Dsimplices ∆D :
Z
X
S top [MD , B̂] =
ωD [B̂] =
ωD [B̂]
(2)
MD

where ωD [B̂] assigns a number to each D-simplex. The
requirement that S top [MD , B̂] is invariant under triangulation leads to the following constraint on ωD [B̂], known
as the “cocycle condition”:
1

dωD [B̂] = 0,

whose solutions are called cocycles. (The left hand side is
evaluated on a D+1-simplex and d is called the coboundary operator analogous to the exterior derivative for differential forms. See Appendix A for further details.) Distinct solutions of the cocycle condition do not necessarily
correspond to distinct topological phases, since two solu0
tions ωD , ωD
may give the same S top on closed manifolds
0
if ωD = ωD + dβD−1 for some function βD−1 . Defining an
0
equivalence relation ωD ∼ ωD
+ dβD−1 on cocycles and
solving for the equivalence classes of cocycles, the resulting algebraic object is known as a cohomology group,
which also provide a way to classify SPTs.
In the traditional SPT, the gauge field B̂ assigns
a group element of G to every 1-dimensional simplex(i.e. links), and are thus called 1-cochain. (A Gvalued m-cochain is an assignment of a group element of
G to each m-simplex.) Gauge transformations are parameterized by a 0-cochain a which assigns a group element to every 0-dimensional simplex(i.e. vertices). Symmetry is parameterized by 0-cochain α. The condition dα = 0 implies α is a constant function on every connected component. Physically this corresponds
to a global symmetry acting on a connected component
of the spatial slice. An example is the Z2 -protected
SPT in D = 2 + 1.4 The Z2 symmetric ground state
wavefunction can be constructed as the superposition of
domain walls in the Z2 symmetry breaking state, with
(−1)no. of domain walls as its amplitude33 .
With the above description of usual SPT states, we
can now describe higher SPTs. Higher SPT states, or “ksymmetry protected topological states” (k-SPT)10,19,21 ,
is a generalization of traditional SPTs. They have
symmetry acting on closed sub-lattices of codimension
k.11–24 . The 1-cochain (i.e. the vector field) B is promoted to (k + 1)-cochain. The gauge transformation is
now described by a k-cochain a:
B → B + da.

The path integral on spacetime lattice MD that realize
a higher SPT state is given by

Z[MD , B̂] =
e2π i MD ωD (B̂+ da)
(4)
{a}

where the dynamical field a is now a k-cochain (a field
which takes values on the k simplices), and S top [MD , B]
is given by eqn. (2). In such a lattice model, the higher
symmetry is generated by a k-cocycle α:
a → a + α.

(5)

We see that the symmetry acts on k-simplices where
α 6= 0. Such k-simplices are dual to a (D−k)-dimensional
manifold α̃ on the dual lattice. The condition dα = 0 implies α̃ has no boundary within the space-time manifold.
α̃ may have a non-empty boundary if it intersects the
boundary of the space-time manifold ∂MD .
When ωD = 0, eqn. (4) describes a state with trivial
k-SPT order. When ωD is a non-trivial cocycle, eqn. (4)

5
realizes a state with a non-trivial k-SPT order. The traditional SPT corresponds to k = 0 case.
The above Lagrangian is a realization of higher SPT
states. In this paper, we show how to convert the above
Lagrangian realization into a Hamiltonian realization. In
the Hamiltonian formalism, a k-symmetry operator acts
on codimension k sub-lattices in the spatial manifold. For
example in a 3 space dimensions, a 1-symmetry operator
acts on closed membranes. These membranes may intersect the boundary as strings. We show in Section VI that
the 1-symmetry membrane operators in the bulk corresponds to 1-symmetry string operators on the boundary.
The hallmark of non-trivial SPT is that its boundary
cannot be gapped with a unique ground state on all manifolds. If it were the case, we could start from a trivial SPT, nucleate a small bubble of the non-trivial SPT,
and expand the bubble to fill up the entire space. This
would have provided a path connecting the trivial and the
non-trivial SPTs without closing the energy gap, leading to a contradiction. Generically the boundary of nontrivial SPT is gapless, breaks symmetry spontaneously,
or has topological order. The inability for the boundary
to achieve a uniquely gapped state on all manifolds is
encoded by the ’t Hooft anomaly of the k-symmetry on
the boundary. Therefore studying such anomaly is a way
to probe the non-trivial nature of the topological bulk.

III. INTUITIVE ARGUMENT FOR BOUNDARY
TRANSFORMATION STRING STATISTICS

In this section we present an informal argument for the
self and mutual statistics of the boundary strings.
The ’t Hooft anomaly of the boundary transformation of SPTs may be interpreted via symmetry
fractionalization34,35 : when the symmetry acts on the
entire boundary manifold, and hence can be extended
into the bulk, the group representation structure is preserved. But when we attempt to examine the symmetry
acting only on a local patch of the boundary manifold,
various group representation structures may be spoiled.
Take for example the non-trivial G-protected 1d 0SPT36 , for which the AKLT37 chain with G = SO(3)
is a well-known instance. The boundary of a 1d segment
are its two endpoints, indexed by L and R respectively.
When the bulk is gapped, the low energy effective theory
are described in terms of its boundary degrees of freedom, and the Hilbert space may be expressed as a tensor
product HL ⊗ HR of the local Hilbert spaces HL and HR
for the two ends. For two group elements g, h acting on
the tensor product space, we have
RL+R (g)RL+R (h) = RL+R (gh)
which says RL+R (g) = RL (g) ⊗ RR (g) is a linear representation of G. This is because when the same g ∈ G
acts on both boundaries, it may be extended into a symmetry acting globally in the bulk, where the group is

represented linearly. When localizing on the left end,
RL becomes a projective representations of G:
RL (g)RL (h) = ω(g, h)RL (gh).
The ’t Hooft anomaly is expressed as the non-trivial
phase ω(g, h), which spoils the linearity of the representation.
In the same spirit, for our case with Zn -1-SPT, we
may expect ’t Hooft anomaly to appear as the spoiling
of some group representation structure when localizing
to a part of the boundary. If the boundary symmetry
can be extended into the bulk, the group representation
structure is expected to be preserved.
Consider the case where we have two 1-symmetries, W1
and W2 , associated with group elements q1Zn and q2Zn respectively. They act on two contractible loops, as shown
below:
q1

q2

Each loop can be extended into the bulk as a 1symmetry acting on a hemisphere. In the bulk, the 1symmetries commute. We therefore expect that on the
boundary, the two loop operators also commute. This is
represented by the diagrammatic equation:
q1

q2

q1

q2

=

There are two intersections of the loops. Motivated
by the symmetry fractionalization picture, we may guess
that when localizing to one of the intersections, the commutativity is spoiled by a U (1) phase e2π i θq1 q2 :
q1

q1

q2

= e2πi

q2

θq1 q2

(6)
If we further assume that two parallel lines associated
Zn
n
with group elements pZ
1 and q1 could stack into a single
Zn
line (p1 + q1 ) without incurring any phase, we can deduce that θq1 q2 is a linear function of q1 by the following

6
manipulations:
q1

e2πi

q1

q2

p1

p1

(θp1 q2 +θq1 q2 )

=

The reason is as follows, imagine when the left hand side
extends into the bulk as two hemispheres which intersect
on a line. On the intersection line, the 1-symmetry acts
trivially and may be removed by reconnecting the membranes near the line. Thus we may reconnect the two
intersecting hemispheres into two non-intersecting membranes which terminates on the surface as shown on the
right hand side. This implies
1

p1 + q1

p1 + q1

q2

θq + θ̄q = 0.

Adding this equation to (8), we get 2θq = θqq . Thus

A similar argument shows θq1 q2 is linear in q2 . We conclude

For some integer-valued function f . An argument similar
to that for the linearity of θq1 q2 implies θq is proportional
q2
to q 2 . So f (q, m, n) ∝ q 2 and the coefficient of 2n
in θq is
an integer. Let’s redefine m to be this integer coefficient.
Thus we have
m 2
θq =
q
2n
Upon q → q + n, the above equation transform as

θq1 q2 ∝ q1 q2

Since q1Zn , q2Zn are defined up to multiples of n, we expect
e2π i θq1 q2 to be invariant under q1 → q1 + n. Thus the
coefficient should be a fraction m
n for some integer m.
θq1 q2 =

m
q1 q2
n

(7)

When q1 = q2 = q, we may also entertain the possibility that at an intersection, the transformation string may
“change track” and incur a U (1) phase e2π i θq or e2π i θ̄q ,
depending on the orientation of the crossing:
q

e−2πi

q

θq

Comparing to (6) with q1 = q2 = q, we observe that

θq − θ̄q = θqq .

On the other hand, we also have the equality of these
two diagrams:
q

q

q
=

m 2 1
q + f (q, m, n)
2n
2

q

so in order for θq to be invariant mod 1, nm must be even.
In the case n is even, m can be chosen from 0, 1, . . . , 2n −
1. With n odd, m must be an even number chosen from
0, 2, 4, . . . , 2n − 2. Each choice gives a distinct set of θq
and θq1 q2 .
Assuming the set of θq and θq1 q2 is bijective to the
set of ’t Hooft anomalies, which is bijective to the set
of 1-SPT phases in the bulk, we would expect the bulk
Zn -1-SPT to have Z2n classification for even n, and Zn
classification for odd n. This agrees with the classification results in Ref.25 derived from cohomology and Ref.26
from cobordism group.
We stress that the odd n case and the even n case
differs only in that the odd m’s are forbidden for odd
n. In fact, all the results in our paper for even m also
applies to odd n case.
In the rest of the paper, we will re-derive the expressions for θq1 q2 and θq formally, using the language of
group cohomology.

A 3+1D MODEL TO REALIZE A Zn -1-SPT
PHASE FOR EVEN n

To construct lattice models with higher symmetries,
it is convenient to do so in the spacetime Lagrangian

7
formalism. We construct a spacetime lattice by first triangulating a D-dimensional spacetime manifold M D . So
a spacetime lattice is a D-complex MD with vertices labeled by i, links labeled by ij, triangles labeled by ijk,
etc(see Fig. 1). The D-complex MD also has a dual complex denoted as M̃D . The vertices of MD correspond to
the D-cells in M̃D , The links of MD correspond to the
(D − 1)-cells in M̃D , etc
Our spacetime lattice model may have a field living on
the vertices, gi . Such a field is called a 0-cochain. The
model may also have a field living on the links, aij . Such
a field is called a 1-cochain, etc. To construct spacetime lattice models, in particular, the topological spacetime lattice models,19,21,38,39 we will use extensively the
mathematical formalism of cochains, coboundaries, and
cocycles (see Appendix A).

EXACTLY SOLVABLE HAMILTONIAN

In this section we derive the exactly solvable Zn -1SPT Hamiltonian. For simplicity we focus on the untwisted theory and set the non-dynamical background
2-connection B̂ Zn = 0 so Z top depends on aZn only. In

uZ . However, ξ3 and ξ2 do not enjoy this property. (See
Appendix J for relationship between ω4 and φ3 in general.)
We will analyze the cases for even and odd m separately. For each case we write down the Hamiltonian

which is the sum over links ij of projections Pij , as described in Appendix B. We can compute Pij by assuming
a hypercubic lattice for the space-time M4 = R4 triangulated as in Appendix D. The Hilbert space is spanned

are three types of links: 1-diagonal, 2-diagonal or 3diagonal. A link ij is defined to be k-diagonal if the
displacement vector from i to j differs by k distinct unit
vectors ∈ {x̂1 , x̂2 , x̂3 }. In the even m case, as shown in

On the boundary ∂M3 , the 1-cocycle αZn is Poincaré
dual to closed loops ∂M3 ∩ αZn . These loops are the
boundary of a 2-manifold −M3 ∩ αZn in the bulk. While
the 1-symmetry is on-site in the bulk, it isR non-onsite on
the boundary, accompanied by the phase ∂M3 φ2 . Since
the bulk is a non-trivial SPT with 1-symmetry, we expect
that its boundary cannot be uniquely gapped without
breaking the 1-symmetry.
The 1-symmetry acts on the boundary as string operators. These string operators can be thought of as hopping
operators for some emergent flux anyons. We measure
the statistics of these anyons in the following subsection.

Boundary transformation strings

C.

Self and mutual statistics of boundary
transformation strings

We triangulate the 2-dimensional boundary ∂M3 as
shown in Fig. 3. We only focus on a yellow central square,
n
whose links are labeled as aZ
i , i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. We define
q
string operators: Wi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, to be the hopping
operator depicted in the bottom of Fig. 3.
Each string operator Wiq is represented by an oriented
red line in the figure. The red line intersects links in the
lattice (colored in gray). Every lattice link intersecting
the red string is being updated as in (37) with α = dhZn .
hZn = q in the pink shaded region and hZn = 0 in the
other unshaded regions. The operator Wiq acts on the
boundary Hilbert space as described in (44), with φ2
given by (45) or (47).

1.

Self-statistics

To compute the self statistics for anyon with flux q,
we compare the result of hopping an anyon from bottom
to top, then another anyon from left to right, versus the
result of hopping an anyon from bottom to right, and
another anyon from left to top.13 As shown in Fig. 4a, the
resulting positions of the two final anyons are exchanged
in the two processes. More explicitly the self-statistic is
given by θq , where
W1q ◦ W2q = e2π i θq W4q ◦ W3q .

(48)

Using (47) to compute the actions of Wiq , the result is
(derivation details in Appendix H)
θq = q 2

m
,
2n

(49)

which is consistent with Ref. 38: The 3+1D bulk state
that we have constructed is a Zn -1-SPT state labeled by
m ∈ {0, 1, · · · , 2n−1}, protected by an on-site (anomalyfree) Zn -1-symmetry. Its boundary has an anomalous
(non-on-site) Zn -1-symmetry generated by closed string

11

FIG. 4. (Color online) (a) To measure the self statistics, we
compare the outcome of two processes. The first hops an
anyon (shown in red) from left to right, and then hops an
anyon (shown in blue) from bottom to top; the second hops
an anyon from left to top and then hops an anyon from bottom
to right. The results differ by exchange of two anyons at their
final positions. (b) To measure the mutual braiding statistics,
we compare the outcome of two processes: the first hops a red
anyon (with flux q1 ) from left to right, followed by hopping
a blue anyon (with flux q2 ) from bottom to top; the second
process do these two operations in the different order. The
results differ by a change of linking number ∆Lk(q1 , q2 ) = 1
between the world lines of the two anyons.
FIG. 3. (Color online) Measurement of self and mutual statistics of flux anyons. Top: A 2D region of ∂M3 is shown.
Here the Hilbert space is spanned by the boundary states
given in (36) and the degrees of freedom are aZn living
on gray links. Red lines depict the boundary 1-symmetry
Wiq which can be regarded of as an anyon hopping operator. The corresponding αZn is non-zero on the gray links
intersecting the redR dotted lines, and change these links by
|aZn i∂ → exp(2π i φ2 )|(a + α)Zn i∂ , where φ2 is given by
(45) or (47). It turns out that, due to φ2 [a, h] = 0 when
dh = 0, in our calculation for self and mutual statistics it is
n
only necessary to keep track of links aZ

q2 anyon from bottom to top, versus the result of doing

operators (see eqn. (45) or eqn. (47)). The corresponding open string operators will created topological excitations on the boundary. The anomaly of the boundary
1-symmetry is encoded in the fractional statistics of those
topological excitations. For instance if n = 2, q = 1, then
for m = 2, the anyon is an emergent fermion. For m = 1
the anyon is an emergent semion.

GAPPED SYMMETRIC BOUNDARIES

In this section we attempt to write down boundary
Hamiltonians which are symmetric under the non-onsite
transformation (44), and contain emergent anyons with
self-statistics predicted by (49). We will show that it is
possible to gap out the boundary by realizing a topological order, which in the (n, m) = (2, 1) case is the double
semion (DS) topological order, which contains an emergent semion. In the (n, m) = (2, 2) case the toric code
is realized on the boundary, which contains an emergent
fermion. The degenerate ground states for these systems
on a manifold with non-trivial cycles spontaneously break
the 1-symmetry.
An easy way to see this is as follows. From ω4 =

Kronecker delta function. h da, ∆i is evaluating the 2cochain da on the 2-simplex ∆. Hence Hp,∆ enforces the
n
“no flux” constraint da = 0 on every 2-simplices. WJ i
is the 1-symmetry operator corresponding to a tiny loop
surrounding site i (see Fig. 5).

H∂ is exactly solvable and has 1-symmetry

To show that H∂ consists of mutually commuting
terms, which also commutes with the boundary 1symmetry operators, it suffices to check the following
commutators vanishes:

a generalization of Ref. 41. It was then applied in Section
IX of Ref. 43, and Section 8 of Ref. 44, which also contains
a lattice Hamiltonian description for a 4+1D bulk/3+1D
boundary.
We give a rough review of their result in the following.
In general, a 1-SPT protected by 1-form finite symmetry Π2 (which is Abelian) and 0-form finite symmetry G,
may be associated with a “2-group” G, such that its classifying space BG = B(G, Π2 ) has π1 = G, π2 = Π2 and
π0 = πk>2 = 0. (In addition, G also contains the data25
2
α2 : G → Aut(Π2 ) and n̄3 ∈ H 3 (BG, Πα
2 ) describing
the interplay between G and Π2 .) A space-time field
configuration is a map φ : MD → BG, and the cocycle
ωD describing the 1-SPT is the pullback: ωD = φ∗ ω̄D
for a topological term ω̄D , which can be an element of
H D (BG, U (1)), or a bordism invariant in general. Section III of Ref. 42 claimed that the gapped boundary of
1-SPT corresponds to a fibration:
BK → BH → BG
such that the topological invariant ω̄D in BG is pulled
back to a trivial topological invariant in BH. Here H is
a 2-group, viewed as an extension of G. BK is the total space of a fibration B 2 K[1] → BK → BK[0] , where
K[0] , K[1] are some 0-form and 1-form symmetries respectively. For a finite group G, B 2 G = K(G, 2) is
a Eilensberg-MacLane space for which the only nontrivial homotopy group is π2 = G. To be precise,
the topological invariants of the classifying spaces BG,
BH are bordism invariants of the bordism groups45,46
ΩSDG (BG), ΩSDH (BH), computed26 with respect to an
“S-structure”, SG,H = SO/O/Spin/Pin± , corresponding to unitary bosonic SPT/time-reversal invariant
bosonic SPT/unitary fermionic SPT/time-reversal invariant fermionic SPT with T 2 = (∓)F , respectively.
In this framework, our Z2 -1-SPT has D = 4, (G, Π2 ) =
(0, Z2 ) and SG = SO. Gapping out its 2+1D boundary
for m = 2 with toric code topological order corresponds
to the fibration:
BZ2 → BSpin(4) × B 2 Z2 → BSO(4) × B 2 Z2
where the pullback of ω̄4 is trivial because of a relation
between Z2 -valued 2-cocycle B Z2 and the Stiefel-Whitney
classes w1 , w2 (which is derived using Wu formula, eg .
in Appendix D.5 of Ref. 38):
Sq2 (B Z2 ) = (w21 + w2 )B Z2 ,
where w1 , w2 vanishes when pulled back to BSpin(4) ×
B 2 Z2 , which is a spin manifold. The emergent fermion
is due to the emergent spin structure.
VIII. GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION OF
GROUND STATE WAVEFUNCTION

Connection to Works of Wan and Wang

A general theory of gapped symmetric boundaries of
higher SPT is presented in Section III of Ref. 42, which is

In this section we attempt to provide an intuitive interpretation of the ground state wavefunction (35) on a
closed 3-manifold.

In a closed 3-manifold M3 , we can ignore the dξ2 term.
In the dual manifold M̃3 , a is dual to 2-chains ã, and da
is dual to ∂ã, which is a 1-cycle.

If we focus on the term 2n

1-diagonal links, we can imagine the dual 2-chains and
1-cycles as living on the dual faces and links of a simple

the 2-chain ã and 1-cycle ∂ã0 at the intersection point p.
If the 1-cycle ∂ã can be resolved into non-intersecting
loops Ki , then ã are the Seifert surfaces Si for these loops.
A Seifert surface of loop Ki is an oriented surface with Ki
as its boundary. It is known that the signed intersection
number between Ki and a Seifert surface of Kj0 is the sum
of signed crossings between Ki and Kj0 (viewed from the
−~1 direction), which is the linking number Lk(K , K 0 )47 .

linking number between Ki and Kj . qi ∈ Z denote the
“strength” of each loop Ki . Note the result (59) is invariant (mod 1) under qi → qi + nui for any integers

that for an unknot

This could be regarded as an alternative way to derive
the self-statistics (49) and mutual-statistics (51) of the
boundary transformation strings, from the 3d bulk space
perspective instead of the 2+1d boundary spacetime perspective.
However, when multiple lines intersect at a point,
we need to carefully resolve the 1-cycle ∂ã into nonintersecting loops. We will consider the even m case and
the odd m case separately.

Each lattice point of the dual cubic lattice has six connecting dual links. Given a dual cycle configuration ∂ã,
we project these six links onto the plane perpendicular
to the −~12 framing vector. Then we resolve the intersection into disjoint loops with “no-crossing” resolution:
requiring that no crossing occurs in this intersection. An
example is shown in Fig. 7.
Since all the crossings are contributed away from intersections, the wavefunction amplitude (59) is

FIG. 7. (Color online) “No-crossing” resolution at an intersection. In the simple cubic dual lattice, every vertex is
connected to six oriented links. Each link carries an integer
q which is the coefficient of the 1-cycle ∂ã. The figure on
the left shows one such configuration, viewed from ~12 . In the
“no-crossing” resolution, each link is resolved into q parallel
strands away from the original vertex. Near the vertex the
strands are connected such that there is no crossing when
viewed from ~12 . Such resolution may not be unique, but can
be fixed by choosing some convention.

FIG. 8. (Color online) (a)A cubic cell is triangulated with
six tetrahedrons. In the dual lattice they corresponds to six
vertices (shown in black), which forms a hexagon. There are
two external links at each face which connects to vertices of a
neighboring cube. (b) Each link is separated into a “remainder” channel (black) dual to ( da)Zn and a “quotient” channel
e. In each tetrahedron, the intersections
(red) dual to nb da
n
for “quotient” channels (red dots) were displaced slightly towards the center of the cube, away from intersections for
“remainder” channels (black dots). The resulting crossings
between “remainder” and “quotient” channels viewed from

the full triangulation described in Appendix D with six
tetrahedrons per unit cubic cell. The dual lattice is a
cubic lattice with six sites forming a hexagon in each
unit cell, depicted in Fig. 8(a).
The “quotient-remainder” resolution is the following:
write da = ( da)Zn + nb da
n e. These two terms are called
the “remainder” and “quotient” respectively. The 1cycles dual to da live on the links of the dual lattice.
We split each link in the dual lattice into two channels:
the “remainder” channel dual to ( da)Zn , and the “quotient” channel dual to nb da
n e. They are depicted as black
and red links respectively in Fig. 8(b). If we detach the
‘quotient” intersections from the “remainder” intersections by displacing them slightly towards the center of
each cube, then da ^ nb da

n e → nb n e + n du. The
change to φ3 [a] mod 1 is 21 ×the sum of signed crossings
between the dual of ( da)Z2 in remainder channel and
the dual of du in the quotient channel. Since both of
them are closed loops living in separate channels, the
total number of signed crossing is even. Hence φ3 [a] is
invariant mod 1.

Geometrically, in 3d space, the 2-cocycle gauge field B̂
is dual to a 1d line B̃. we may shift these lines in the
±~21 directions to obtain B̃± . Then the extra terms (67)
m
contributes a phase e2π i 2n to every signed intersections
between B̃± and ã (Recall ã is the surface dual to a).
For simplicity let’s pretend ã will not fluctuate too
wildly near the intersection, and so B̃± gives the same
number of signed intersections as B̃, then the extra terms
m
contribute a phase e2π i n for every such intersection.

Thus in a Zn -1-SPT labeled by m, consider the 1symmetry transformation |{a}i → |{a + α}i = |{a0 }i,

charge −m under the boundary 1-symmetry.
We observe that the above boundary argument extends
to the odd m case as well. (68) still holds by inspecting
(62) and again assuming dh = 0 near the end point where
B̂ 6= 0. So we expect the same charge attachment also
occurs for odd m.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we studied the Zn -1-symmetry protected
topological states in 3+1-dimensions, which is labeled by
m ∈ {0, 1, · · · , 2n − 1}. The Zn -1-symmetry is generated by closed membrane operators. We presented an
exactly solvable Hamiltonian which commutes with the
closed membrane operators, and wrote down the ground
state wavefunction. We also studied the effective boundary theory in 2+1-dimensions. The effective boundary
theory has an anomalous Zn -1-symmetry generated by
closed string operators. We showed that those boundary string operators create topological excitations at the

string ends, which may have non-trivial self-statistics. In
particular for the n = 2 case, they have self-semionic
(for m = 1) or fermionic statistics (for m = 2). In
these cases we can gap out the boundary with an engineered boundary Hamiltonian with the anomalous Zn 1-symmetry, which gives the same ground state as the
toric code model (for m = 2) and double-semion model
(for m = 1) on the boundary. We interpreted the wavefunction amplitudes of the bulk grounds states as linking
numbers of strings in the dual lattice. Finally we extend
to the case of non-zero background gauge field and find
the lines dual to the background gauge field is attached
with line charge −m.
In the future, we would like to study the nature of
the gapless boundary states. It is also interesting to see
whether other knot invariants can be derived from the
wavefunction amplitude for other 1-SPT’s.

Appendix A: Space-time complex, cochains, and
cocycles

In this paper, we consider models defined on a spacetime lattice. A spacetime lattice is a triangulation of
the D-dimensional spacetime M D , which is denoted by
MD . We will also call the triangulation MD as a spacetime complex, which is formed by simplices – the vertices,
links, triangles, etc. We will use i, j, · · · to label vertices
of the spacetime complex. The links of the complex (the
1-simplices) will be labeled by (i, j), (j, k), · · · . Similarly,
the triangles of the complex (the 2-simplices) will be labeled by (i, j, k), (j, k, l), · · · .
In order to define a generic lattice theory on the spacetime complex MD using local Lagrangian term on each
simplex, it is important to give the vertices of each simplex a local order. A nice local scheme to order the vertices is given by a branching structure.5,48,49 A branching
structure is a choice of orientation of each link in the ddimensional complex so that there is no oriented loop on
any triangle (see Fig. 10).
The branching structure induces a local order of the
vertices on each simplex. The first vertex of a simplex is
the vertex with no incoming links, and the second vertex
is the vertex with only one incoming link, etc. So the
simplex in Fig. 10a has the following vertex ordering:
0, 1, 2, 3.
The branching structure also gives the simplex (and its
sub-simplices) a canonical orientation. Fig. 10 illustrates
two 3-simplices with opposite canonical orientations compared with the 3-dimension space in which they are embedded. The blue arrows indicate the canonical orientations of the 2-simplices. The black arrows indicate the

canonical orientations of the 1-simplices.
Given an Abelian group (M, +), an n-cochain fn is
an assignment of values in M to each n-simplex, for example a value fn;i,j,··· ,k ∈ M is assigned to n-simplex
(i, j, · · · , k). So a cochain fn can be viewed as a bosonic
field on the spacetime lattice.
M can also be viewed a Z-module (i.e. a vector space
with integer coefficient) that also allows scaling by an
integer:
x + y = z,
x, y, z ∈ M,

x ∗ y = z,
m ∈ Z.

(A1)

The direct sum of two modules M1 ⊕M2 (as vector spaces)
is equal to the direct product of the two modules (as sets):
as set

M1 ⊕ M2 = M1 × M2

(A2)

We like to remark that a simplex (i, j, · · · , k) can have
two different orientations. We can use (i, j, · · · , k) and
(j, i, · · · , k) = −(i, j, · · · , k) to denote the same simplex
with opposite orientations. The value fn;i,j,··· ,k assigned
to the simplex with opposite orientations should differ by
a sign: fn;i,j,··· ,k = −fn;j,i,··· ,k . So to be more precise fn
is a linear map fn : n-simplex → M. We can denote the
linear map as hfn , n-simplexi, or
hfn , (i, j, · · · , k)i = fn;i,j,··· ,k ∈ M.

(A3)

More generally, a cochain fn is a linear map of n-chains:
fn : n-chains → M,

(A4)

(A5)

where a chain is a composition of simplices. For example,
a 2-chain can be a 2-simplex: (i, j, k), a sum of two 2simplices: (i, j, k) + (j, k, l), a more general composition
of 2-simplices: (i, j, k) − 2(j, k, l), etc. The map fn is
linear respect to such a composition. For example, if a
chain is m copies of a simplex, then its assigned value
will be m times that of the simplex. m = −1 correspond
to an opposite orientation.
We will use C n (MD ; M) to denote the set of all ncochains on MD . C n (MD ; M) can also be viewed as
a set all M-valued fields (or paths) on MD . Note that
C n (MD ; M) is an Abelian group under the +-operation.
The total spacetime lattice MD correspond to a Dchain. We will use the same MD to denote it. Viewing
fD as a linear map of D-chains, we can define an “integral” over MD :
Z
fD ≡ hfD , MD i
(A6)

X
=
si0 i1 ···iD (fD )i0 ,i1 ,··· ,iD .
(i0 ,i1 ,··· ,iD )

Here si0 i1 ···iD = ±1, such that a D-simplex in the Dchain MD is given by si0 i1 ···iD (i0 , i1 , · · · , iD ).
We can define a derivative operator d acting on an ncochain fn , which give us an (n + 1)-cochain (see Fig.
11):

where i0 i1 i2 · · · îm · · · in+1 is the sequence i0 i1 i2 · · · in+1
with im removed, and i0 , i1 , i2 · · · in+1 are the ordered
vertices of the (n + 1)-simplex (i0 i1 i2 · · · in+1 ).
A cochain fn ∈ C n (MD ; M) is called a cocycle if
dfn = 0. The set of cocycles is denoted by Z n (MD ; M).
A cochain fn is called a coboundary if there exist a
cochain fn−1 such that dfn−1 = fn . The set of coboundaries is denoted by B n (MD ; M). Both Z n (MD ; M) and

19
B n (MD ; M) are Abelian groups as well. Since d2 =
0, a coboundary is always a cocycle: B n (MD ; M) ⊂
Z n (MD ; M). We may view two cocycles differ by a
coboundary as equivalent. The equivalence classes of cocycles, [fn ], form the so called cohomology group denoted
by
H n (MD ; M) = Z n (MD ; M)/B n (MD ; M),

(A8)

H n (MD ; M), as a group quotient of Z n (MD ; M) by
B n (MD ; M), is also an Abelian group.

For example

is a Z-valued cocycle. Here βN is Bockstein homomorphism.
We notice the above definition for cochains still makes
sense if we have a non-Abelian group (G, ·) instead of an
Abelian group (M, +), however the differential d defined
by eqn. (A7) will not satisfy d◦ d = 1, except for the first
two d’s. That is, one may still make sense of 0-cocycle
and 1-cocycle, but no more further naively by formula
eqn. (A7). For us, we only use non-Abelian 1-cocycle
in this article. Thus it is ok. Non-Abelian cohomology
is then thoroughly studied in mathematics motivating
concepts such as gerbes to enter.
From two cochains fm and hn , we can construct a third
cochain pm+n via the cup product (see Fig. 12):
pm+n = fm ^ hn ,
hpm+n , (0 → m + n)i = hfm , (0 → m)i×
hhn , (m → m + n)i,

(A10)

(A11)

Note that the above definition applies to cochains with
global.
The cup product has the following property
d(hn ^ fm ) = ( dhn ) ^ fm + (−)n hn ^ ( dfm ) (A12)
for cochains with global or local values. We see that hn ^
fm is a cocycle if both fm and hn are cocycles. If both fm
and hn are cocycles, then fm ^ hn is a coboundary if one
of fm and hn is a coboundary. So the cup product is also
an operation on cohomology groups ^: H m (M D ; M) ×
H n (M D ; M) → H m+n (M D ; M). The cup product of two
cocycles has the following property (see Fig. 12)

More generally hn ^ hn is a cocycle if n+k = odd and hn

for Z2 -valued cocycles or cohomology classes. Here, we
like to define a generalized Steenrod square for M-valued
cochains cn :

We can show that the transfer matrix is a projection
with a computation:

Zero background gauge field case

Suppose M4 = M3 × I for some closed 3-manifold
M3 and I is an interval parameterized by t ∈ [0, T ], to
be regarded as the time direction. The space-time has
boundaries at t = 0, T , where the field configurations are
given by {a0 } and {aT }. The transfer matrix is given by

where the top and bottom ellipses represent the spatial
closed manifold M3 at t = T, 0 respectively. They are the
boundaries of the space-time cylinder and are drawn as
bold lines. Note that although M3 is a three-dimensional
manifold, we draw it as a one-dimensional ellipse.
Recall from Ref.5,51 that under a local
spacetime reR
triangulation, the topological action M4 ω4 changes by
1
dω4 . Hence the cocycle condition dω4 = 0 implies the action is invariant under re-triangulation mod 1. Moreover,
during a re-triangulation, the boundary degrees of freedom cannot
R change, thus we can only conclude that the
value of M3 ×I ω4 is independent of triangulations of the
internal bulk, but it couldR depend on the boundary triangulation. Furthermore, M3 ×I ω4 is independent of the
values of aint . This is because during a re-triangulation,
the internal link values are forgotten, which can be illustrated with the re-triangulation of a square:

=

0

Thus Z top [{aT }, {a0 }] is independent of both the triangulation and field configuration of the internal bulk
and only depends on the configuration at its boundaries.

are the number of links at the two boundaries and in
the space-time bulk respectively. In the following we assume the two boundaries have the same triangulation so
Nl,0 = Nl,T = Nl,M3 .

Since the eigenvalues of a projection is 1 or 0, correspondingly Ĥ∞ has eigenvalues 0 or ∞, i.e. an infinite
energy gap.
Moreover, the transfer matrix has trace 1. This is because Tr[ e−T Ĥ∞ ] is evaluated by identifying the top and
bottom link configurations of the cylinder and summing
over them. With the two ends identified, M3 × I =
M3 × S 1 becomes a closed manifold. As we showed in
(22), on a closed manifold without any background gauge

hence the ground state of Ĥ∞ is unique.
Although the transfer matrix is a non-local operator,
it can be decomposed Rinto a product of local operators.
Suppose we evaluate M3 ×I ω4 with a triangulation of
the internal space-time, such that it consists of Nl,M3 +
1 infinitesimal spatial slices, each slice having the same
triangulation of the spatial slices at t = 0, T . Between

the internal links. Thus Pij Pkl = Pkl Pij .

where double slash indicates the region in which field configurations on the top needs to be identified with that on

associated with M3 × S 1 with a slit at the link ij. This
means that in M3 , the links far away from ij become
internal links in the non-zero matrix elements of Pij , and
hence the non-zero matrix elements of Pij are independent of the value of links far away from ij. Thus Pij is a
local operator.
Using the same arguments as before, it can be shown
that Pij is a projection operator with trace nNl,M3 −1 .
So each projection by Pij reduces the dimension of the
ground state Hilbert space by a factor or n. Furthermore,
in the following we will show that any two such operators
Pij , Pkl commute. The two orderings Pij Pkl or Pkl Pij

Non-zero background gauge field case

Suppose we are given a background gauge field on the
spatial manifold M3 . In order to define the transfer matrix, we need to specify the background gauge field B̂
on the spacetime M3 × I. We propose that B̂ should
be static, meaning that it should be invariant under time
translation, i.e. B̂ is the same on every spatial slice. This
is sensible because a non-static background gauge field
actually correspond to the insertion of a 1-symmetry operator into the transfer matrix.
Such static background gauge field B̂ on M3 × I can
be constructed from a given flat B̂ on M3 as follows. We
triangulate M × I such that any 2-cell (ijk) in M3 × I,
when projected onto M3 , is either also a 2-cell (i0 j0 k0 )
in M3 , or a lower dimensional cell. Then we define
(
hB̂, (i0 j0 k0 )i if (ijk) projects to a 2-cell
hB̂, (ijk)i :=
0
else

23
it can be checked B̂ = 0.
We then construct the transfer matrix with such static
background gauge field. Diagrammatically, the transfer
matrix is represented as follows:

projections only when ij is near the non-zero B̂. Its corresponding diagram is

{aT }

Pij [B̂] =

aT,ij

//

//

e−T Ĥ∞ [B̂] =
//

{a0 }
where the wiggly vertical line represents the static B̂. We
may repeat the same analysis as in the previous subsection, except that we include a wiggly vertical line in the
diagrams. For example, in showing the transfer matrix
is a projection, we have
P

{a2T }

{a0 }

{a0 }

We need to be slightly careful about generalizing the
argument that trace of transfer matrix is 1. Recall from
the previous section at (B4), we used the fact that on a
closed manifold M4 = M3 × S 1 , we have
Z
Z

ω4 [ da] =
ω4 [0] = 0,

M4

which is due to gauge invariance of the topological action
(21). In the present case we have
Z
Z
1
ω4 [B̂ + da] =
ω4 [B̂]

M4

To complete the argument, note that a “static” background gauge field on M3 × S 1 may be extended into a
higher dimensional manifold M3 × D2 , where ∂D2 = S 1
with the same construction as before.52 Thus
Z

Zero background gauge field case

Suppose ω4 = dφ3 for some 3-cochain φ3 (which may
not have 1-symmetry, so this does not mean ω4 is a
coboundary with 1-symmetry), then φ3 can be interpreted as the phase
state wavefunction.

Non-zero background gauge field case

Suppose ω4 [B̂ + da] = ω4 [B̂] + dφ3 [a, B̂]. While it is
still true that M3 = ∂M40 for some manifold M40 , there
may be obstructions in M40 that forbids the extension of
the background gauge field into M40 , while respecting the
flatness constraint dB̂ = 0.
So we will instead take M40 = M3 × I, where I =
[−1, 0] is an interval. The boundary
now have two com`
ponents ∂M40 = M3 × {0} M3 × {−1}. We take the
first component to be the original spatial manifold and
extend the field configurations such that on the other end
M3 × {−1}, we fix a = 0. The background gauge field is
extended to be “static” as in the previous section.

Appendix D: Triangulation of hypercubic lattice

∆p = {1 ≥ xp(1) ≥ · · · ≥ xp(d) ≥ 0}.

where we have defined δ(x) := x|0 . In the last step we
used integration by part and the fact that δaZn dδaZn =
0 because it is impossible for both factors of the cup
product to be non-zero, since δaZn is non-zero for only
one link ij. So Using the triangulation of Appendix D

In this section we derive (58). We also assume a = aZn

Appendix J: ω4 , φ3 and φ2

In the main text, we find that for Zn -1-SPT, the 4cocycle ω4 , the ground state wavefunction amplitude φ3 ,
and the boundary transform anomalous phase φ2 are related via (26) and (40):
ω4 [ daZn ] = dφ3 [a]
−δα φ3 [aZn ] = dφ2 [a, h].

Note for a = aZ2 and a0 = a0Z2 , we have b a+a

Also for any simplex (i, j, k), the “no flux” constraint
means

In general, given ω4 satisfying dω4 = 0. We can define

the 3-cochain φ03 as follows:

A heuristic way to interpret 0 is that it is located at t =
−∞ whereas the other vertices i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are located at
a spatial slice at t = 0. So aii0 are “spatial” links and a∗
0i

so ω4 = dφ03 .
To generalize (40), note that if we have a 1-symmetry
α = dh only on the spatial links, then we can use the
invariance of ω4 under space-time 1-symmetry to undo h
from the spatial links and act (−h) on the temporal links
instead, i.e.
∗

hφ03 [a + α], (1234)i = hφ03 [a + dh], (1234)i

Appendix K: Generalization of (49) and (51) to
G-protected 1-SPT for finite unitary groups

In general, we can carry through the calculations for
self-statistics and mutual-statistics for transformation
strings, for a G-protected 1-SPT in 3+1D as well, where
G is any unitary group. Note G is Abelian since it is a
1-symmetry. In this section we will only present the final
results.
Following similar strategies for deriving self- and
mutual-statistics in the Zn case, it can be shown that
for general unitary group G, the self- and mutual- statistics of transformation strings are given by

The intuition is that the obstruction for such extension
is due a “symmetry twist” in the time direction. For example, when the line dual to B̂ sweeps through a noncontractible surface in 3d, which is equivalent to insertion
of a 1-symmetry operator acting on the non-contractible
surface.
