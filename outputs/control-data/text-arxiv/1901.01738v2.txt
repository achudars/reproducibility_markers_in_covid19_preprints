Abstract. For G a finite non-Abelian group we write cpGq for the probability that two
randomly chosen elements commute and kpGq for the largest integer such that any kpGqcolouring of G is guaranteed to contain a monochromatic quadruple px, y, xy, yxq with
xy ‰ yx. We show that cpGq Ñ 0 if and only if kpGq Ñ 8.

1. Introduction
Our starting point is Schur’s theorem [Sch16, Hilffssatz], the proof of which adapts to
give the following.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose that G is a finite group and C is a cover of G of size k. Then there
is a set A P C with at least ck |G|2 triples px, y, xyq P A3 where ck is a constant depending
only on k.
The proof is a routine adaptation, but we shall not give it as the result as stated also
follows from our next theorem.
If G is non-Abelian then we might like to ask for quadruples px, y, xy, yxq P A4 instead
of triples and establishing the following such result (which we do in §2) is the main purpose
of the paper.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that G is a finite group and C is a cover of G of size k. Then there
is a set A P C with ck |G|2 quadruples px, y, xy, yxq P A4 where ck is a constant depending
only on k.
When G is non-Abelian we should like to ensure that at least one of the quadruples found
in Theorem 1.2 has xy ‰ yx, and to this end we define the commuting probability of a
finite group G to be
1 ÿ
(1.1)
cpGq :“
1rxy“yxs ;
|G|2 x,yPG
in words it is the probability that a pair px, yq P G2 chosen uniformly at random has xy “
yx. There are many nice results about the commuting probability – see the introduction
to [Heg13] for details – and it is an instructive exercise (see [Gus73]) to check that if
cpGq ă 1 then cpGq ď 58 , so that if a group is non-Abelian there are ‘many’ pairs that do
not commute. Despite this we have the following which we prove in §3.
Proposition 1.3. Suppose that G is a finite group and cpGq ě ǫ. Then there is a cover
C of G of size exppp2 ` oǫÑ0 p1qqǫ´1 log ǫ´1 q such that if A P C and px, y, xy, yxq P A4 then
xy “ yx.

If G is non-Abelian we write kpGq for the non-commuting Schur number of G, that
is the largest natural number such that for any cover C of G of size kpGq there is some
A P C and px, y, xy, yxq P A4 with xy ‰ yx. (Note that since G is assumed non-Abelian
we certainly have kpGq ě 1.)
The number kpGq has been studied for a range of specific groups by McCutcheon in
[McC] and we direct the interested reader there for examples and further questions.
Theorem 1.4. Suppose that pGn qn is a sequence of non-Abelian groups. Then cpGn q Ñ 0
if and only if kpGn q Ñ 8.
Proof. The right to left implication follows immediately from Proposition 1.3. We can
assume that ck is monotonically decreasing. Suppose that cpGn q Ñ 0 and there is a k0 and
an infinite set S of naturals such that kpGn q ă k0 for all n P S. Let n P S be such that
cpGn q ă ck0 which can be done since cpGn q Ñ 0 and ck0 ą 0.
Since kpGn q ă k0 there is a cover C of Gn of size k0 such that if A P C and px, y, xy, yxq P
A4 then xy “ yx. By Theorem 1.2 there is A P C such that px, y, xy, yxq P A4 for at least
ck0 |Gn |2 quadruples. But then by design xy “ yx for all these pairs and so cpGn q ě ck0 , a
contradiction which proves the result.

Before closing the section we need to acknowledge our debt to previous work. In [McC12]
McCutcheon proves that kpSn q Ñ 8 as n Ñ 8. A short calculation shows that cpSn q Ñ 0
as n Ñ 8, and the possibility of showing that kpGn q Ñ 8 as cpGn q Ñ 0 is identified by
Bergelson and Tao in the remarks after [BT14, Theorem 11]. Earlier, in [BT14, Footnote
4], they also observe the significance of Neumann’s work [Neu89] which is the main idea
behind the proof of Proposition 1.3.
Write DpGq for the smallest dimension of a non-trivial unitary representation of G.1 In
[BT14, Corollary 8] the authors show that kpGn q Ñ 8 as DpGn q Ñ 8, and in fact go
further proving a density result. For general finite groups there can be no density result;
we refer the reader to the discussion after [BT14, Theorem 11] for more details.
2. Proof of Theorem 1.2
The proof of Theorem 1.2 is inspired by an attempt to translate the proof of [BM98,
Theorem 3.4] into a combinatorial setting. There the authors use a recurrence theorem
[BMZ97, Theorem 5.2]; in its place we use a version of the Ajtai-Szemerédi Corners Theorem [AS74] for finite groups. This was proved by Solymosi [Sol13, Theorem 2.1] using the
triangle removal lemma.
Theorem 2.1. There is a function f∆ : p0, 1s Ñ p0, 1s such that if G is a finite group and
A Ă G2 has size at least α|G|2 then

is called the quasirandomness of G in [BT14, Definition 1] following the work of Gowers [Gow08]

Proof. Following the proof of [Sol13, Theorem 2.1], form a tripartite graph with three
copies of G as the vertex sets (call them V1 , V2 , V3 ) and joining px, yq P V1 ˆ V2 if and only
if px, yq P A; py, wq P V2 ˆ V3 if and only if py ´1w, yq P A; and px, wq P V1 ˆ V3 if and only if
px, wx´1 q P A. The map G3 Ñ G3 ; px, y, wq ÞÑ px, y, y ´1wx´1 q is a bijection and px, y, wq
is a triangle in this graph if and only if px, yq, pzx, yq, px, yzq P A where z “ y ´1wx´1 .
It follows from [Tao06, Theorem 1.1] that one can remove at most 3 ¨ oSpAqÑ0 p|G|2 q “
oSpAqÑ0 p|G|2 q elements from A to make the graph triangle-free. On the other hand if
px, yq P A then px, y, xyq is a triangle in the above graph, hence we must have removed all
elements from A and α|G|2 ď oSpAqÑ0 p|G|2 q from which the result follows.

There are a number of subtleties around the extent to which one can replace, say, pzx, yq
with pxz, yq, and we refer the reader to the papers of Solymosi [Sol13] and Austin [Aus16]
for some discussion.
We take the convention, as we can, that the function f∆ is monotonically increasing
and f∆ pxq ď x for all x P p0, 1s. Even with Fox’s work [Fox11] we only have f∆ pαq´1 ď
T pOplog α´1 qq in general. However, when G is Abelian much better bounds are known as
a result of the beautiful arguments of Shkredov [Shk06b, Shk06a, Shk09]. It seems likely
these could be adapted to give a bound with a tower of bounded height if the Fourier
analysis is adapted to the non-Abelian setting in the same way as it is for Roth’s theorem
in [San17]. Doing so would give a quantitative version of [BT14, Theorem 10] (see [BT14,
Remark 44]), but the improvement to Theorem 1.2 would only be to replace a wowzer-type
function with a tower as we shall see shortly.
We shall prove the following proposition from which Theorem 1.2 follows immediately
on inserting the bound for f∆ given by Theorem 2.1.
Proposition 2.2. Suppose G is a finite group and C is a cover of G of size k. Then
there is a set A P C with pg pk`1q p1qq2 |G|2 quadruples px, y, xy, yxq P A4 where g pk`1q is the
pk ` 1q-fold composition of g with itself, and g : p0, 1s Ñ p0, 1s; α ÞÑ p3kq´1 f∆ pαk q.
Proof. Write A1 , . . . , Ak for the sets in C ordered so that they have density α1 ě . . . ě αk
respectively; since C is a cover we have α1 ě k1 . Let r P t1, . . . , ku be minimal such that
1
(2.1)
f∆ pα1 ¨ ¨ ¨ αr q ě αr`1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` αk ,
3
which is possible since the sum on the right is empty and so 0 when r “ k. From minimality
and the order of the αi s we have
1
αi`1 ą
f∆ pα1 ¨ ¨ ¨ αi q for all 1 ď i ď r ´ 1.
3k
The function f∆ is monotonically increasing and f∆ pxq ď x for all x P p0, 1s so it follows
from the above that αr ě g prq p1q ě g pkq p1q.
Now, suppose that s1 , . . . , sr P G and write
Ai :“ tpx, yq P G2 : xsi y P Ai u for 1 ď i ď r.
Then
Esi PG 1Ai px, yq “ αi for all x, y P G and 1 ď i ď r,

3. Proof of Proposition 1.3
The key idea comes from Neumann’s theorem [Neu89, Theorem 1] which is already
identified in [BT14, Footnote 4]. Neumann’s theorem describes the structure of groups G
for which cpGq ě ǫ – they are the groups containing normal subgroups K ď H ď G such
that K and G{H have size Oǫ p1q and H{K is Abelian. Neumann’s theorem was further
developed in [Ebe15, Theorem 2.4], but both arguments provide a more detailed structure
than we require.
We have made some effort to control the exponent; results such as [Ebe15, Lemma 2.1]
or [Ols76, Theorem 2.2] could be used in place of Kemperman’s Theorem in what follows
at the possible expense of the 2 becoming slightly larger. Moving the 2 ` oǫÑ0p1q below
1 would require a slightly different approach as we normalise a subgroup of index around
ǫ´1 at a certain point which costs us a term of size ǫ´1 !.
Proposition (Proposition 1.3). Suppose that G is a finite group and cpGq ě ǫ. Then there
is a cover C of G of size exppp2 ` oǫÑ0p1qqǫ´1 log ǫ´1 q such that if A P C and px, y, xy, yxq P
A4 then xy “ yx.
Proof. We work with the conjugation action of G on itself (i.e. pg, xq ÞÑ g ´1 xg), and write
xG for the conjugacy class of x (the orbit of x under this action), and CG pxq for the centre
of x in G (the stabiliser of x under this action).
Let η, ν P p0, 1s be parameters (we shall take ν “ 21 and η “ ǫ{ log ǫ´1 q) to be optimised
later and put
X :“ tx P G : |xG | ď η ´1 u.
Then

Writing κ :“ |X|{|G| we can rearrange the above to see that κ ě pǫ ´ ηq{p1 ´ ηq.
Suppose that s P N is maximal such that
s times
hkkikkj
| X ¨ ¨ ¨ X | ě p1 ` p1 ´ νqps ´ 1qq |X|.

Certainly there is some s P N since the inequality certainly holds for s “ 1, and there is a
´1
maximal such with s ď κ1´ν´ν since |X| ě κ|G|.
Since 1G
G “ t1G u we have 1G P X and 1G P X ¨ ¨ ¨ X for any s-fold product. By Kemperman’s Theorem [Kem56, Theorem 5] (also recorded on [Ols84, p111], and which despite
the additive notation does not assume commutativity) it follows that there is some H ď G
such that
s`1 times

so that |H| ą ν|X|, and so |G{H| ă ν ´1 κ´1 .
Let K be the kernel of the action of left multiplication by G on G{H i.e. K :“ tx P G :
xgH “ gH for all g P Gu. The action induces a homomorphism from G to SympG{Hq so
that by the First Isomorphism Theorem
K Ÿ G and |G{K| ď | SympG{Hq| ď |G{H|!.
Each x P H (and hence each x P K since xH “ H for such x) can be written as a
product of s ` 1 elements of X. Moreover, the function x ÞÑ |xG | is sub-multiplicative i.e.
|pxyqG | ď |xG ||y G | and so it follows that
Z

G

|x | ď η
ď R :“ η
for all x P X s`1 ,
and in particular for all x P K. Thus for each x P K there is an injection φxG : xG Ñ
t1, . . . , Ru. With this notation we can define our covering: let
S :“ ttx P K : φxG pxq “ iu : 1 ď i ď Ru and C :“ ppG{KqztKuq Y S,
so that S is a cover of K and C is a cover of G. Now
|C| ď |G{K| ´ 1 ` |S| ď tν ´1 κ´1 u! ´ 1 ` R

Optimise this by taking ν “ 12 and η “ ǫ{ log ǫ´1 as mentioned before so that κ ě ǫp1 ´
oǫÑ0p1qq and log η ´1 “ p1 ` oǫÑ0p1qq log ǫ´1 .
Suppose that A P C and x, y, xy, yx P A. If A P pG{KqztKu then xK “ yK “
xyK “ yxK “ A. Since K Ÿ G we have xK “ xyK “ pxKqpyKq and so yK “ K
which is a contradiction. It follows that A P S and hence x, y, xy, yx P K. We conclude
φpxyqG pxyq “ φpyxqG pyxq but xy “ y ´1pyxqy and so pxyqG “ pyxqG . Since φpxyqG is an
injection we conclude that xy “ yx as required.
The result is proved.
