Electrons in graphene exhibit hydrodynamic behavior in a certain range of temperatures. We
indicate that in this regime electric current can result in cooling of electron fluid due to the JouleThomson effect. Cooling occurs in the Fermi-liquid regime, while for the Dirac fluid the effect results
in heating.

can be characterized by the temperature drop δT = T1 −

either sign and is defined such that α > 0 corresponds to
cooling.
Textbook derivations of the JT effect start with the
enthalpy conservation:

If collective effects of electron interactions in a very
clean sample prevail over impurity scattering, electrons
may flow as a viscous fluid [1]. The hydrodynamic regime
of electron transport is observed in graphene in a certain
range of temperatures [2–7], and in other 2d materials
[8, 9]. Spectacular consequences of hydrodynamic transport include negative local resistivity [2–4, 7], violation
of ballistic bound on conductance [2, 6, 9, 10] (Gurzhi effect [1]), breakdown of Wiedemann-Franz law [5, 9, 11],
and negative magnetoresistance [9, 12] (see [13–15] for reviews). Another possible manifestation of collective electron flow is cooling of electron fluid passing through a
narrow constriction.
In the solid state setting electric current normally
generates heat, and cooling of electron flow may look
counterintuitive, but in fluid mechanics this phenomenon
is well known and underlies a widely used method of
gas refrigeration by throttling, which exploits the JouleThomson (JT) effect [16]. Our goal is to theoretically
study the counterpart of the JT effect in graphene.
More conventional cooling mechanism due to tunneling
through graphene-insulator-superconductor junction has
been considered in [17].
The simplest realization of throttling is a flow through
constriction, illustrated in fig. 1. Consider two strips of
graphene connected by a narrow bridge and subject to
a constant voltage δU . Upon passing from one strip to
another the temperature of electron fluid may change as
a result of work done by external force. Assuming that
one strip is kept at temperature T1 and denoting electron

later see that effects of viscous heating and momentum
dissipation can be absorbed into redefinition of A while
preserving the same functional form of the cooling coefficient. For the time being we keep A as a parameter.

where vF is the Fermi velocity, q labels particles/holes,
and the overall factor of four takes into account valley
and spin degeneracy. We tacitly assume that holes and
electrons are in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is not
a good approximation in neutral graphene. Near the neutrality point electrons and holes should be treated separately [15, 18], so our derivation will break down near
µ = 0.
The rest of thermodynamic quantities can be calculated from dP = ndµ + sdT . When applied to (3) the

Ohmic resistance due to momentum relaxation. As we
shall see, viscous heating is the prime source of enthalpy
production and leads to order one effects, while effects of
Ohmic resistance are parametrically small with the size
of opening in the constriction.

is described by the Navier-Stokes equations [11]:

The effect changes sign at the inversion point. The existence of such is well familiar from thermodynamics of
ordinary gases. The JT coefficient for the full range of
chemical potentials is plotted in fig. 2. At the neutrality
point the coefficient is infinite signaling the breakdown of
our assumptions. As explained above the failure of the
derivation has to do with absence of local equilibrium
between electrons and holes at the neutrality point.
The thermodynamic derivation of the JT effect relies
on enthalpy conservation, but enthalpy production in the
moving electron fluid may be substantial. In general, mechanical effects of the flow cannot be neglected. We will
not attempt to develop comprehensive theory, but will
consider two effects not accounted for by simple thermodynamics, the viscous heating by mechanical shear and

(9)

where Πij = ∂i vj + ∂j vi − δij ∂k v k is the shear tensor and
η is the shear viscosity. These equations constitute four
conditions for four unknowns – the local temperature, the
chemical potential, and the two components of velocity.
The bulk viscosity ζδij ∂k v k vanishes in graphene due to
underlying conformal invariance and, in addition, we only
consider divergence-free flows for which the bulk viscosity
does not contribute. We also assume that electrons are
locked to holes or that holes are absent due to charge
imbalance. Then motion of the electron fluid can then
be described as a flow of charge, otherwise one needs to
introduce separate hydrodynamic variables for holes and
electrons [18].

In absence of viscosity, specific enthalpy is constant along
the flow lines, as was assumed in the simple-minded thermodynamic derivation. Non-linear terms of order v/vF ,
neglected because v  vF , presumably become important for very small viscosity, but we assume that viscosity is sufficiently large to suppress non-linearities. Notice
that viscosity can be absorbed into rescaling v → η −1 v,
and will drop from the final answer for the JT coefficient.
It is instructive to rewrite enthalpy non-conservation in
a different form. Combining (10) with the third equation
in (9) we get:

(11)

The right-hand side is the manifestly positive entropy
production rate due to the viscous shear. It may be expected on general grounds that viscosity leads to stronger
heating or weaker cooling and thus diminishes the JT coefficient compared to the thermostatic consideration. We
are now going to quantify this effect.
The only assumptions so far were stationarity of the
flow and v  vF . If in addition we assume that electrons
move slowly compared to any other scale, the equations
simplify and can be essentially linearized. For instance,
assuming that all gradients are small, ∂nv  n∂v, the
first two equations in (9) become equivalent to the diver-

3
gence free condition:
∂i v i = 0
η∂ 2 vi = ∂i P.

(12)

These are Stokes equations for a stationary flow of an
incompressible fluid at low Reynolds number. They can
be solved exactly for the geometry in fig. 1 [10]:
P = P0 −

We now turn to Ohmic resistivity. One may anticipate,
on general grounds, that impurity scattering and interaction with phonons have a smaller thermal effect than
viscosity for slow, low Reynolds number flows. The argument essentially follows from dimensional analysis. Momentum non-conservation due to umklapp or impurity

is characterized macroscopically

Here z = x + iy, a is the width of the bridge, and u is the
maximal velocity attained by the fluid. The square root
is analytic on the complex plane with a semi-infinite cut
representing the constriction.
The solution obeys the no-slip boundary conditions:
vi (x, 0) = 0 for |x| > a. Another commonly discussed
possibility is no-stress, vy = 0, ∂y vx = 0. While experimental results are consistent with no-slip [8, 9], theory
arguments suggest that the no-stress conditions are more
realistic at low temperatures [19]. It would be interesting
to repeat the calculation for this case or for more general
mixed boundary conditions [19].

The momentum-relaxation length λ is estimated to lie
between a fraction [2, 4] to a few [6] microns. We assume
that the opening in the constriction is smaller: a  λ.
In this regime the flow is affected by momentum relaxation only far away from the constriction, for |z| ∼ λ,
while the two factors important for the JT effect, the
pressure drop and the entropy production, mostly occur
at |z| ∼ a. The ensuing corrections to the JT coefficient
are thus small, suppressed by the ratio a/λ. A more
careful analysis shows that the effect is logarithmically
enhanced if the total size of the system is much larger
than the momentum-relaxation length: L  λ.
Hydrodynamically, momentum relaxation is described
by an additional damping term in the Navier-Stokes
equation [13]:

The relation δP = nδµ + sδT then gives the same formula (3) for the JT coefficient, but with A = 2/3. Alternatively the same result can be derived by computing
the enthalpy production with the help of (10).
The resulting JT coefficient is displayed in fig. 2. As
expected, viscosity diminishes the cooling effect in the
whole range of parameters, leading to stronger heating or
weaker cooling compared to ideal thermodynamics. Interestingly, all the dependence on the velocity, geometry
of the constriction and even on shear viscosity cancels out
leaving behind order one reduction in the cooling power.

The flow equations for generic a and λ can only be
solved numerically, but for a  λ an approximate analytic solution can be constructed. The near zone is accurately described by (13) so long as |z|  λ, while for
|z|  a the opening in the constriction can be approximated by the delta-function. In that approximation the
solution can again be found analytically, generalizing the
known result at λ = ∞ [20] to finite λ. The strategy
is to Fourier transform in x and solve the ensuing linear
ODEs with the boundary conditions

The small-k divergence of the integral defining pressure is
actually fake, it can be absorbed into the constant of integration, but the ensuing log behavior at large distances
will have interesting bearing on the JT effect. The integral can be explicitly evaluated:

where Y1 , H1 are Neumann and Struve functions, respectively. The solution is valid for y > 0. One can readily

overlapping region of validity a  |z|  λ.
In the opposite regime of |z|  λ the pressure grows

The velocity also drops too slowly, and the total entropy production will log diverge. These results are easy
to understand qualitatively. When propelling electrons
through the sample, the external force must do extra
work to counter momentum relaxation. This leads to a
larger pressure drop. The entropy production increases
due to additional Ohmic losses. Both effects turn out to
be logarithmically enhanced.
The total pressure drop is thus defined by the size of
the whole sample:

in the logarithmic approximation. The correction due
to momentum relaxation is parametrically small with a,
but the coefficient is logarithmically enhanced for a large
sample. For a more realistic situation of L ∼ λ the correction should still be of order a2 /λ2 , but the coefficient
is more difficult to calculate and will certainly depend on
geometry.
Hydrodynamic nature of electron flow in biased
graphene leads to JT cooling when the current is forced
through a narrow constriction. Cooling occurs in the
Fermi liquid regime, for sufficiently large charge imbalance or at sufficiently low temperatures. In the geometric
setting at hand the inversion point lies at µinv = 3.32T
(fig. 2). For lower chemical potentials the JT effect results in heating, which is most pronounced in the Dirac
liquid regime of µ  T . Although similar to conventional Joule heating the mechanics behind this effect is
quite different, in particular the temperature increment is
linear in applied voltage and not quadratic. We expect,
but have not checked, that effects of the conventional
Joule heating due to normal resistivity are parametrically smaller than viscosity-driven entropy production.
It is necessary to keep in mind however that our derivation is invalid close to the neutrality point.
It would be interesting to study the JT effect for different geometries of the flow and for more general boundary
conditions. Our assumptions break down at the neutrality point where electrons and holes are not in equilibrium
with each other and to develop reliable theory for neutral
graphene one would need to treat the flow of electrons
and holes separately [18]. Finally, it would be interesting
to understand the strong-coupling regime, perhaps with
the help of the AdS/CFT methods [21].
